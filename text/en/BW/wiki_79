<text>Dystonia is a neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder in which sustained or repetitive muscle contractions occur involuntarily, resulting in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures. The movements may resemble a tremor. Dystonia is often intensified or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles.

The disorder may be hereditary or caused by other factors such as birth-related or other physical trauma, infection, poisoning (e.g., lead poisoning) or reaction to pharmaceutical drugs, particularly neuroleptics, or stress. Treatment must be highly customized to the needs of the individual and may include oral medications, chemodenervation botulinum neurotoxin injections, physical therapy, or other supportive therapies, and surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation.

==Classification==

There are multiple types of dystonia, and many diseases and conditions may cause dystonia.

Dystonia is classified by:
# Clinical characteristics such as age of onset, body distribution, nature of the symptoms, and associated features such as additional movement disorders or neurological symptoms, and
# Cause (which includes changes or damage to the nervous system and inheritance).
Physicians use these classifications to guide diagnosis and treatment.

===Types===
* Generalized
* Focal
* Psychogenic
* Acute dystonic reaction
* Vegetative-vascular

===Generalized dystonias===
For example, dystonia musculorum deformans (Oppenheim, Flatau-Sterling syndrome):

* Normal birth history and milestones
* Autosomal dominant
* Childhood onset
* Starts in lower limbs and spreads upwards

Also known as torsion dystonia or idiopathic torsion dystonia (old terminology &quot;dystonia musculorum deformans&quot;).

===Focal dystonias===

These most common dystonias are typically classified as follows:

The combination of blepharospasmodic contractions and oromandibular dystonia is called cranial dystonia or Meige&#x27;s syndrome.

===Genetic/primary===

There is a group called myoclonic dystonia where some cases are hereditary and have been associated with a missense mutation in the dopamine-D2 receptor. Some of these cases have responded well to alcohol.

Other genes that have been associated with dystonia include CIZ1, GNAL, ATP1A3, and PRRT2. Another report has linked THAP1 and SLC20A2 to dystonia.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms vary according to the kind of dystonia involved. In most cases, dystonia tends to lead to abnormal posturing, in particular on movement. Many individuals with the condition have continuous pain, cramping, and relentless muscle spasms due to involuntary muscle movements. Other motor symptoms are possible including lip smacking.

An accurate diagnosis may be difficult because of the way the disorder manifests itself. Affected individuals may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, essential tremor, carpal tunnel syndrome, temporomandibular joint disorder, Tourette&#x27;s syndrome, conversion disorder or other neuromuscular movement disorders. It has been found that the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntington&#x27;s disease, where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation, sustained fist clenching, knee flexion, and foot inversion. Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntington&#x27;s disease include long disease duration and use of antidopaminergic medication.

==Causes==
&quot;Primary dystonia&quot; is suspected when the dystonia is the only sign and there is no identifiable cause or structural abnormality in the central nervous system. Researchers suspect it is caused by a pathology of the central nervous system, likely originating in those parts of the brain concerned with motor function—such as the basal ganglia and the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) producing Purkinje neurons. The precise cause of primary dystonia is unknown. In many cases it may involve some genetic predisposition towards the disorder combined with environmental conditions.

Meningitis and encephalitis caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal infections of the brain have been associated with dystonia. The main mechanism is inflammation of the blood vessels, causing restriction of blood flow to the basal ganglia. Other mechanisms include direct nerve injury by the organism or a toxin, or autoimmune mechanisms.

Malfunction of the sodium-potassium pump may be a factor in some dystonias. The - pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. This suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic, &quot;housekeeping&quot; molecule for ionic gradients; but could be a computational element in the cerebellum and the brain. Indeed, an ouabain block of - pumps in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia. Ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations, dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations. A mutation in the - pump (ATP1A3 gene) can cause rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism. The parkinsonism aspect of this disease may be attributable to malfunctioning - pumps in the basal ganglia; the dystonia aspect may be attributable to malfunctioning - pumps in the cerebellum (that act to corrupt its input to the basal ganglia) possibly in Purkinje neurons.

Cerebellum issues causing dystonia is described by Filip et al. 2013: &quot;Although dystonia has traditionally been regarded as a basal ganglia dysfunction, recent provocative evidence has emerged of cerebellar involvement in the pathophysiology of this enigmatic disease. It has been suggested that the cerebellum plays an important role in dystonia etiology, from neuroanatomical research of complex networks showing that the cerebellum is connected to a wide range of other central nervous system structures involved in movement control to animal models indicating that signs of dystonia are due to cerebellum dysfunction and completely disappear after cerebellectomy, and finally to clinical observations in secondary dystonia patients with various types of cerebellar lesions. It is proposed that dystonia is a large-scale dysfunction, involving not only cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways, but the cortico-ponto-cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop as well. Even in the absence of traditional &quot;cerebellar signs&quot; in most dystonia patients, there are more subtle indications of cerebellar dysfunction. It is clear that as long as the cerebellum&#x27;s role in dystonia genesis remains unexamined, it will be difficult to significantly improve the current standards of dystonia treatment or to provide curative treatment.&quot;

==Treatment==
Various treatments focus on sedating brain functions or blocking nerve communications with the muscles via drugs, neuro-suppression, or selective denervation surgery. Almost all treatments have negative side-effects and risks. A &quot;geste antagoniste&quot; is a physical gesture or position (such as touching one&#x27;s chin) that temporarily interrupts dystonia, it is also known as a &quot;sensory trick&quot;. Patients may be aware of the presence of a geste antagoniste that provides some relief. Therapy for dystonia can involve prosthetics that passively simulate the stimulation.

===Physical intervention===
While research in the area of effectiveness of physical therapy intervention for dystonia remains weak, there is reason to believe that rehabilitation can benefit dystonia patients. Physical therapy can be utilized to manage changes in balance, mobility and overall function that occur as a result of the disorder. A variety of treatment strategies can be employed to address the unique needs of each individual. Potential treatment interventions include splinting, therapeutic exercise, manual stretching, soft tissue and joint mobilization, postural training and bracing, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, constraint-induced movement therapy, activity and environmental modification, and gait training.

Recent research has investigated further into the role of physiotherapy in the treatment of dystonia. A recent study showed that reducing psychological stress, in conjunction with exercise, is beneficial for reducing truncal dystonia in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Another study emphasized progressive relaxation, isometric muscle endurance, dynamic strength, coordination, balance, and body perception, seeing significant improvements to patients&#x27; quality of life after 4 weeks.

Since the root of the problem is neurological, doctors have explored sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to &quot;rewire&quot; itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors such as Nancy Byl and Joaquin Farias has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and proprioceptive stimulation can induce neuroplasticity, making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost due to Cervical Dystonia, hand dystonia, blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, dysphonia and musicians&#x27; dystonia.

Due to the rare and variable nature of dystonia, research investigating the effectiveness of these treatments is limited. There is no &quot;gold standard&quot; for physiotherapy rehabilitation. To date, focal cervical dystonia has received the most research attention; however, study designs are poorly controlled and limited to small sample sizes.

==== Baclofen ====
A baclofen pump has been used to treat patients of all ages exhibiting muscle spasticity along with dystonia. The pump delivers baclofen via a catheter to the thecal space surrounding the spinal cord. The pump itself is placed in the abdomen. It can be refilled periodically by access through the skin. Baclofen can also be taken in tablet form

==== Botulinum toxin injection ====
Botulinum toxin injections into affected muscles have proved quite successful in providing some relief for around 3–6 months, depending on the kind of dystonia. Botox or Dysport injections have the advantage of ready availability (the same form is used for cosmetic surgery) and the effects are not permanent. There is a risk of temporary paralysis of the muscles being injected or the leaking of the toxin into adjacent muscle groups, causing weakness or paralysis in them. The injections must be repeated, as the effects wear off and around 15% of recipients develop immunity to the toxin. There is a Type A and a Type B toxin approved for treatment of dystonia; often, those that develop resistance to Type A may be able to use Type B.

==== Muscle relaxants ====
Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, is also sometimes prescribed. However, for most, their effects are limited and side-effects like mental confusion, sedation, mood swings, and short-term memory loss occur.

==== Ketogenic diet ====
One complex case study found that a ketogenic type diet may have been helpful in reducing symptoms associated with alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) of a young child. However, as the researchers noted, their results could have been corollary in nature and not due to the diet itself, though future research is warranted.

===Surgery===

Surgery, such as the denervation of selected muscles, may also provide some relief; however, the destruction of nerves in the limbs or brain is not reversible and should be considered only in the most extreme cases. Recently, the procedure of deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven successful in a number of cases of severe generalised dystonia. DBS as treatment for medication-refractory dystonia, on the other hand, may increase the risk of suicide in patients. However, reference data of patients without DBS therapy are lacking.

==History==

The Italian Bernardino Ramazzini provided one of the first descriptions of task-specific dystonia in 1713 in a book of occupational diseases, The Morbis Artificum.
In chapter II of this book&#x27;s Supplementum, Ramazzini noted that &quot;Scribes and Notaries&quot; may develop &quot;incessant movement of the hand, always in the same direction … the continuous and almost tonic strain on the muscles... that results in failure of power in the right hand&quot;. A report from the British Civil Service also contained an early description of writer&#x27;s cramp. In 1864, Solly coined the term &quot;scrivener&#x27;s palsy&quot; for this condition. These historical reports usually attributed the etiology of the motor abnormalities to overuse. Then, dystonia was reported in detail in 1911, when Hermann Oppenheim, Edward Flatau and Wladyslaw Sterling described some Jewish children affected by a syndrome that was retrospectively considered to represent familial cases of DYT1 dystonia. Some decades later, in 1975, the first international conference on dystonia was held in New York. It was then recognized that, in addition to severe generalized forms, the dystonia phenotype also encompasses poorly-progressive focal and segmental cases with onset in adulthood, such as blepharospasm, torticollis and writer&#x27;s cramp.
These forms were previously considered independent disorders and were mainly classified among neuroses. A modern definition of dystonia was worded some years later, in 1984. During the following years it became evident that dystonia syndromes are numerous and diversified, new terminological descriptors (e.g., dystonia plus, heredodegenerative dystonias, etc.) and additional classification schemes were introduced. The clinical complexity of dystonia was then fully recognized.

<text>In computing, a normal number is a non-zero number in a floating-point representation which is within the balanced range supported by a given floating-point format: it is a floating point number that can be represented without leading zeros in its significand.

The magnitude of the smallest normal number in a format is given by: 

formula_1 

where &quot;b&quot; is the base (radix) of the format (like common values 2 or 10, for binary and decimal number systems), and &quot;formula_2&quot; depends on the size and layout of the format. 

Similarly, the magnitude of the largest normal number in a format is given by 

:formula_3

where &quot;p&quot; is the precision of the format in digits and &quot;formula_2&quot; is related to &quot;formula_5&quot; as:

formula_6

In the IEEE 754 binary and decimal formats, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, formula_2, and &quot;formula_5&quot; have the following values:
For example, in the smallest decimal format in the table (decimal32), the range of positive normal numbers is 10−95 through 9.999999 × 1096.

Non-zero numbers smaller in magnitude than the smallest normal number are called [[Normal number (computing)|subnormal]] numbers (or &quot;denormal numbers&quot;).

Zero is considered neither normal nor subnormal.

<text>The slaty bristlefront (Merulaxis ater) is a member of the Neotropical bird family Rhinocryptidae, the tapaculos. It is endemic to south-east Brazil.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The slaty bristlefront and Stresemann&#x27;s bristlefront (&quot;Merulaxis stresemanni&quot;) form a superspecies, and the two might actually be one species. It has no subspecies.

==Description==

The slaty bristlefront is long. A male weighed 
 and a female . The male is mostly dark blue gray. The lower back is dark brown and the flanks, vent, and tail are black. The female is over all shades of brown, lighter on the throat and breast. Both sexes have a crest of short stiff feathers that stand erect at the base of the bill and forehead. 

==Distribution and habitat==

The slaty bristlefront is found only in southeastern Brazil, in a narrow band near the Atlantic coast from Espírito Santo south to Santa Catarina. It might have formerly occurred further north in southern Bahia.

The slaty bristlefront is a bird of humid forests in both lowlands and mountains. In a few locations it is found at elevations as low as but more typically its lower limit is . In the northern part of its range it is found only in the mountains, as high as .

==Behavior==
===Feeding===

Little is known about the slaty bristlefront&#x27;s diet. It is known to forage in pairs, though not close together, on the ground and in low vegetation.

===Breeding===

One slaty bristlefront nest has been described, in Rio de Janeiro state. It was constructed by both members of a pair using twigs, narrow leaves, and leaf stems with a lining of lichen. It was placed in a roughly horizontal burrow at least long in an earthen bank.

===Vocalization===
The slaty bristlefront begins its song with a series of clicks followed by a trill described as &quot;hysterical laughter&quot;. It has several calls, described as 
“tsewk-tsewk, pit”, “keekick”, and “he-he-heeheeheehee”.

==Status==
The IUCN has assessed the slaty bristlefront as least concern. It is threatened by habitat loss, especially in the lowlands.

<text>The Little Joe 2 was a test of the Mercury space capsule, carrying the rhesus monkey Sam (&quot;Macaca mulatta&quot;) close to the edge of space. He was sent to test the space equipment and the adverse effects of space on humans.

The flight was launched December 4, 1959, at 11:15 a.m. ET from Wallops Island, Virginia, United States. Little Joe 2 flew to an altitude of 55 miles (88 km). It was recovered with the monkey intact and alive in the Atlantic Ocean by the USS &quot;Borie&quot;. Sam was one of a series of monkeys in space. Sam, from the School of Aviation Medicine in San Antonio, Texas, received his name as an acronym of the facility. Sam experienced up to 12Gs and three minutes of weightlessness. The flight time was 11 minutes, 6 seconds, with a payload of 1,007 kg.

The boilerplate Mercury spacecraft used in the Little Joe 2 mission is currently displayed at Airpower Park and Museum, Hampton, Virginia.

<text>Charles Sydney Hopkinson (1869 – 1962) was an American portrait painter and landscape watercolorist. He maintained a studio in the Fenway Studios building in Boston from 1906 to 1962. He painted over 800 portraits in a direct style with a palette gradually lightening through his career. Many of his paintings were commissioned by U. S. East Coast institutions, especially Harvard University, where he acted as house portraitist. Among his sitters were Oliver Wendell Holmes, Calvin Coolidge, Lewis Perry and John Masefield.

== Early life ==
Born on July 27, 1869, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he graduated the Hopkinson School started by his father. He began to draw for the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; upon his entrance to Harvard in 1888, and in 1891, he moved to New York City to study at the Art Students&#x27; League where he worked with John Henry Twachtman and H. Siddons Mowbray.

Hopkinson studied at the Académie Julian in Paris with Edmond Aman-Jean, traveled to Brittany, and exhibited in the 1895 Paris Salon.

== Career ==
In the late 1890s he worked in Cambridge, Massachusetts and showed his paintings in New York at the Society of American Artists and also in Boston. He was a Member of the Boston Art Club and was involved in the promotion of Modern Art in Boston and Cambridge.

He returned to Europe in 1901, where he visited Spain to study the painting of Velázquez and El Greco and traveled through Brittany, and the Netherlands to see portraits by his &quot;heroes&quot;, Frans Hals and Rembrandt.

Hopkinson then began a lucrative career as a portrait painter in Cambridge winning awards like the Logan Medal of the arts (1926), and soon his first commission being a baby portrait in 1896 of poet E. E. Cummings, a work that is in the Massachusetts Historical Society.

Adopting the colour theories of his former neighbour Denman Ross, who had become a prominent collector and a teacher at Harvard, Hopkinson later used the results of Carl Cutler&#x27;s experiments with a spinning disk to study the color spectrum.

He exhibited regularly in the national annuals and at several Boston and New York galleries. His watercolors were described as &quot;modern&quot; in the press and he exhibited three oils in the 1913 Armory Show. Instead of allying himself with the local established painters, Hopkinson showed his work with the &quot;Boston Five&quot;, a group of young watercolorists though he continued to paint in oil for an elite clientele.

In 1919 the National Art Commission selected him to paint some of the participants of the Peace Conference at Versailles, France. In 1927 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1929.

In the mid-1920s, Hopkinson took on a young Boston painter Pietro Pezzati as his assistant, who worked with him at his Fenway studio. Hopkinson would pass on his studio to Pezzati when he died in October 1962, in Beverly, Massachusetts.

Hopkinson died October 16, 1962.

<text>:&quot;&quot;Craigdarroch, An Accessory to Murder&quot; is an expansion set for the board game Kill Doctor Lucky&quot;


Craigdarroch is a house near Moniaive, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It was the seat of the Chief of the Dumfriesshire Fergussons for 600 years. 
Built by William Adam in 1729 over the old house dating from the earliest records (14th century).

The Marriage Home of Annie Laurie (the heroine of &#x27;the world&#x27;s greatest love-song&#x27;) who married Alexander Fergusson, 14th Laird of Craigdarroch, on 29 August 1709, and lived there for 33 years.

The first Fergusson of Craigdarroch on record was Jonkyne, who flourished in the 14th century. Robert, his descendant in the 6th generation, married Lady Janet Cunningham, daughter of the 4th Earl of Glencairn of Maxwelton, in 1537 and their marriage stone, with the shakefork of the Cunninghams, is to be seen with the other carved stones on the base of the old tower of Craigdarroch. The upper part of the tower was demolished when the present early 18th-century house was built.

Their eldest grandson, Thomas, married in 1609 (marriage stone), but died soon after, without inheriting. His younger brother, Robert, married Katherine, daughter of the 6th Earl of Cunningham, and their son, William Fergusson had a marriage contract with Sara Grierson, which was signed on 9 May 1621, daughter of Sir William Grierson of Lag, 9th Lord of Lag and their marriage stone, with the three cushions and star of the Griersons, is also to be seen. Robert was M.P. for Dumfriesshire, as were also his son, his grandson, and his great-grandson.

His grandson, John, Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, rode from Craigdarroch to Killiecrankie in 1689, where he was killed in battle. His servant returned with his master&#x27;s horse and saddle and the saddle was kept at the top of the stairs until 1918 when it went to Caprington Castle where it still is. The story goes that his wife, Elizabeth, refused to believe her husband was dead and pined her days away waiting for his return, and subsequently haunted the saddle right up until 1920 when the ghost was laid by a Jesuit with Bell, Book and Candle. There is no doubt about the ghost, and no doubt about the laying of it, but history records that Elizabeth married twice afterwards, and the ghost was more probably Elizabeth Maxwell, John&#x27;s mother.

His son, Alexander, born in 1685, actively supported King William against the Stuarts. In 1710 he married Anna Laurie or Annie Laurie, daughter of Sir Robert Laurie, Bt., of Maxwelton House, near Moniaive, the &quot;Annie Laurie&quot; of the song. In 1726 they commissioned William Adam, father of Robert Adam, Scotland&#x27;s most famous architect, to build the new house. The estimate for the work in William Adam&#x27;s handwriting (copy in the house) came to the then princely sum of £526 2s 9d. It was completed, much as it is today, in 1729, the date above the present front door. Robert Adam, then under his father&#x27;s tuition, designed and made the fireplace in the hall. &quot;Annie Laurie&quot; lived at Craigdarroch for over 50 years and died at Friars&#x27; Carse, near Auldgirth, in 1763. Some sources suggest she may have been buried at Craigdarroch, but as she was a lifelong worshipper at Kirkland Church, her grave may be there, but it has not been located.

Their son James, Chamberlain to the 3rd Duke of Queensberry, lived all his life at Drumlanrig Castle and was there when &#x27;Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27; came with his Highland Army in December 1745. The Highland Army was not popular in the district and did considerable damage as it passed through. At Craigdarroch, the Fergussons and staff wisely decided to flee the house when they were requested to provide hospitality to the pretender. When the coast was clear they returned, only to find the house ransacked and much of the furniture burnt as fuel.

His son Alexander was the victor in the contest for the Whistle, celebrated in Robert Burns&#x27; poem. The actual whistle is an heirloom, also at Caprington Castle

Alexander&#x27;s son, Robert, 17th Laird, was perhaps the most distinguished member of the family. He was a lawyer, Attorney-General of Bengal, later, M.P. for the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, Judge Advocate General and a Privy Councillor. He built the &#x27;pond&#x27;, turned the course of Craigdarroch Water, laid out the policies much as they are now, and built the west wing.

His grandson, Robert, died in 1904, leaving no heir - for the first time in 600 years - but twin daughters, the elder of whom, Ella, married William Cunninghame, 14th Laird of Caprington, descendant of the Earls of Glencairn, in 1918, and their elder son Robert inherited the castle and property.

After 1904 the house was occasionally rented by Clare Dubs who bought it in 1923, living there until he died in 1943 when it passed to his nephew (by marriage), Robert Sinclair Scott, who sold it in 1957 to Adam Dalzell who died in 1961.

In 1962 it was acquired by the present occupant&#x27;s now deceased father-in-law whose wife&#x27;s uncle was a Fergusson, kinsman to the Fergussons of Craigdarroch.

During the 19th century various alterations and additions were made - the Oriel window in the drawing-room; the Chapel, built in 1889 of oak and stone from the estate; and later the billiard room wing, replacing former conservatories, and rebuilt in 1932 as the present study. In the chapel there are photographs of the 50 or so estate workers and their families all together in their Sunday finery at the turn of the 20th century. Some of them would have worked in the extensive walled garden and greenhouses, now derelict, to provide produce for the house. Others would have worked on the local tenanted farms and in forestry on the estate.

During the late war (1939–1945) the house was allocated to a special unit of the Norwegian Army since when it has been lived in for short periods only until the present occupation. Modern conditions do not encourage developments and improvements, but they continue slowly. In recent years the house has been used for events and meetings and plans are in progress to use it as a wedding and function venue.

Craigdarroch House is open to the public throughout July each year from 2pm to 4pm. It is situated 2 miles west of Moniaive on the B729.

<text>The Happy Land fire was an act of arson that killed 87 people on March 25, 1990, in the Bronx in New York City, United States. The 87 victims were trapped in the unlicensed Happy Land social club, located at 1959 Southern Boulevard in the West Farms section of the Bronx. Most of the victims were young Hondurans celebrating Carnival, many of them part of the Garifuna American community. Cuban refugee Julio González, whose former girlfriend was employed at the club, was arrested soon afterward and ultimately convicted of arson and murder.

The fire was the deadliest in New York City since the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which coincidentally occurred on the same day in 1911, and the deadliest in American territory since the Dupont Plaza Hotel fire in Puerto Rico in 1986 and the Winecoff Hotel Fire in 1946.

== Background ==

The building that housed Happy Land club was managed by Jay Weiss, the primary leaseholder, and Morris Jaffe. In 1987, Weiss and Jaffe&#x27;s company, Little Peach Realty Inc., had leased the building space for seven years to the club owner, Elias Colon, who died in the fire. An eviction trial against Colon had been scheduled to start on March 28, 1990, three days after the fire.

Before the blaze, Happy Land was ordered to close for building code violations in November 1988. Violations included lack of fire exits, alarms or sprinkler system. No follow-up by the fire department was documented.

Julio González served three years in prison in Cuba during the 1970s for desertion from the Cuban Army. In 1980, he faked a criminal record as a drug dealer to help him gain passage in the Mariel boatlift. The boatlift landed in Florida; he then traveled to Wisconsin and Arkansas and eventually settled in New York, sponsored by the American Council for Nationalities in Manhattan.

Six weeks before the fire, he split up with his girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano. Before that, González had lost his job at a lamp factory in Queens. At the time of the fire, he was two weeks behind on the rent of his room, and the owner of the boarding house where he was staying said of him: &quot;From what I know, he was down to his last hope.&quot;

==Incident==
The evening of the fire, González had argued with his former girlfriend, Feliciano, who was a coat check worker at the club, urging her to quit. She said that she had had enough of him and did not want anything to do with him anymore. He was ejected by the bouncer around 3:00 a.m. He was heard to scream drunken threats to &quot;shut this place down.&quot; He also reportedly shouted, &quot;I&#x27;ll be coming back.&quot; Feliciano tried to warn others, worried that González was going to do something.

González went to an Amoco gas station, then returned to the establishment with a plastic container with $1.00 worth of gasoline. He spread the fuel at the base of a staircase, the only access into the club, and then ignited the gasoline.

Eighty-seven people died in the resulting fire. Nineteen bodies were found downstairs; the others upstairs. Six bodies were found within several feet of the front door. Some of those trapped punched a hole through a wall to an adjoining union hall in an attempt to escape. Most of the deaths were from asphyxiation or trampling. The club filled with toxic smoke so quickly that some victims were found with drinks still in hand. Most of the victims were young Hondurans celebrating Carnival, largely drawn from members of the local Garifuna American community. A hundred and fifty firemen responded to the blaze, which was extinguished in five minutes.

Initial reports indicated that only three people survived the blaze, but later reports gave the number of survivors as five or six. Among them were Feliciano, the club owner&#x27;s wife, and disc jockey Ruben Valladares. Valladares was hospitalized in guarded condition with second- and third-degree burns over half his body.

After setting the fire, González returned home, removed his gasoline-soaked clothes and fell asleep. He was arrested the following afternoon after police investigators interviewed Feliciano and learned of the previous night&#x27;s argument. Once advised of his rights, he admitted to starting the blaze.

== Legal proceedings ==

=== Arsonist ===
González was charged with 174 counts of murder, two for each victim, and was found guilty on 87 counts of arson and 87 counts of murder on August 19, 1991. For each count, he received the maximum sentence of 25 years to life. He was eligible for parole during March 2015 as New York law states that the sentences for multiple murders occurring during one act must be served concurrently, rather than consecutively.

González was denied parole in March 2015. He would have been eligible to apply for parole again in November 2016, but he died in prison of a heart attack on September 13, 2016, at the age of 61.

=== Landlords and other parties ===
The Bronx District Attorney said that the building&#x27;s owner, Alex DiLorenzo III, and leaseholders Weiss and Morris Jaffe, were not responsible criminally, since they had tried to close the club and evict the tenant. Weiss was at the time the husband of actress Kathleen Turner. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; quoted Turner saying that &quot;the fire was unfortunate but could have happened at a McDonald&#x27;s&quot;.

Although the Bronx District Attorney said they were not criminally responsible, the New York City Corporation Counsel filed misdemeanor charges in February 1991 against Alex DiLorenzo III, the building owner, and Jay Weiss, the primary leaseholder. These charges claimed that the owner and landlord were responsible for the building code violations caused by their tenant. They both pleaded guilty in May 1992, agreeing to perform community service and paying $150,000 towards a community center for Hondurans in the Bronx.

A $5 billion lawsuit was also filed by the victims and their families against the owner, landlord, city, and some building material manufacturers. That suit was settled in July 1995 for $15.8 million or $163,000 per victim. The lesser amount was due mostly to unrelated financial difficulties of the landlord.

==Legacy==
The street outside the former Happy Land social club has been renamed &quot;The Plaza of the Eighty-Seven&quot; in memory of the victims. Five of the victims were students at nearby Theodore Roosevelt High School, which had a memorial service for the victims in April 1990. A memorial was erected directly across the street from the former establishment with the names of all 87 victims inscribed on it.

The plot of the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Heaven&quot; was inspired by the Happy Land fire.

Additionally, the band Duran Duran wrote the song &quot;Sin of the City&quot;, which appeared on the band&#x27;s 1993 self-titled album, about the fire.
The song &quot;Happyland&quot; on Joe Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Night and Day II&quot;, released in 2000, was also inspired by this event. In the Jay-Z song &quot;You, Me, Him and Her&quot; he raps &quot;The fire I spit burnt down Happy Land/ Social club, we unapproachable thugs.&quot;

In the aftermath of the Ghost Ship warehouse fire in Oakland, California, in December 2016, which killed 36 people, comparisons were drawn to this fire. The Oakland fire also occurred in a space that was being used for parties in violation of law and lease agreement. Investigations of the law and lease agreements were pending at the time of that fire as well.

<text>FCAPS is the ISO Telecommunications Management Network model and framework for network management. &quot;FCAPS&quot; is an acronym for fault, configuration, accounting, performance, security, the management categories into which the ISO model defines network management tasks. In non-billing organizations &quot;accounting&quot; is sometimes replaced with &quot;administration&quot;.

==Background==
The ISO, under the direction of the OSI group, has created a network management model as the primary means for understanding the major functions of network management systems. The model in question is interchangeably called either the &quot;OSI network management model&quot; or &quot;ISO network management model&quot; so the full name could be the &quot;OSI/ISO network management model&quot;.

The comprehensive management of an organization&#x27;s information technology (IT) infrastructure is a fundamental requirement. Employees and customers rely on IT services where availability and performance are mandated, and problems can be quickly identified and resolved. Mean time to repair (MTTR) must be as short as possible to avoid system downtimes where a loss of revenue or lives is possible.

==History==
In the early 1980s the term FCAPS was introduced within the first Working Drafts (N1719) of ISO 10040, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Systems Management Overview (SMO) standard. At that time the intention was to define five separate protocol standards, one for each functional area. Since initial experiences showed that these protocols would become very similar, the ISO working group responsible for the development of these protocols (ISO/TC97/SC16/WG4, later renamed into ISO-IEC/JTC1/SC21/WG4) decided to create a single protocol for all five areas instead. This protocol is called common management information protocol (CMIP). In the 1990s the ITU-T, as part of their work on Telecommunications Management Network (TMN), further refined the FCAPS as part of the TMN recommendation on Management Functions (M.3400). The idea of FCAPS turned out to be very useful for teaching network management functions; most textbooks therefore start with a section that explains the FCAPS.

==The five areas of function of the model==
The OSI network management model categorizes five areas of function, sometimes referred to as the &quot;FCAPS model:&quot; FCAPS can be seen as the predecessor of the newer FAB model defined in the Business Process Framework (eTOM). FAB is short for fulfillment, assurance, billing. As guideline, you can map the two models as follows:

The FCAPS model can be seen as bottom-up or network-centric. The FAB model looks at the processes more from top-down, is customer/business-centric. The two standards that have emerged are Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) by IETF and Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) by ITU-T.

==Fault management==
A fault is an event that has a lot of significance. The goal of fault management is to recognize, isolate, correct and log faults that occur in the network. Furthermore, it uses trend analysis to predict errors so that the network is always available. This can be established by monitoring different things for abnormal behavior.

When a fault or event occurs, a network component will often send a notification to the network operator using either a proprietary or open protocol such as SNMP (such as WhatsUp Gold, HP OpenView or Sun Solstice–formerly Net Manager), to collect information about network devices or at least write a message to its console for a console server to catch and log/page. In turn, the management station can be configured to make a network administrator aware of problems (by email, paging, or on-screen messages), allowing appropriate action to be taken. This notification is supposed to trigger manual or automatic activities. For example, the gathering of more data to identify the nature and severity of the problem or to bring backup equipment on-line.

Fault logs are one input used to compile statistics to determine the provided service level of individual network elements, as well as sub-networks or the whole network. They are also used to determine apparently fragile network components that require further attention. Errors primarily occur in the areas of fault management and configuration management.

Network elements produce alarms (also known as &quot;traps&quot; or &quot;indications&quot;) that are monitored by a Fault management system. This function is known as alarm surveillance. Fault management systems include HP Network Node Manager i, IBM Tivoli, EMC Smarts, CA Spectrum, NetIQ, TTI Telecom Netrac, Objective Systems Integrators NETeXPERT, opEvents by Opmantek, Centina&#x27;s vSure, Infosim StableNet, iReveal, ERAMON etc. Fault isolation tools like Delphi are also available, which are basically used to isolate the fault in any telecom network. A Fault management system is usually the primary feature of a network operations center.

==Configuration management==
The goals of configuration management include:
* to gather and store configurations from network devices (this can be done locally or remotely).
* to simplify the configuration of the device
* to track changes that are made to the configuration
* to configure (&#x27;provision&#x27;) circuits or paths through non-switched networks
* to plan for future expansion and scaling

Configuration management is concerned with monitoring system configuration information, and any changes that take place. This area is especially important, since many network issues arise as a direct result of changes made to configuration files, updated software versions, or changes to system hardware. A proper configuration management strategy involves tracking all changes made to network hardware and software. Examples include altering the running configuration of a device, updating the OS version of a router or switch, or adding a new modular interface card. While it is possible to track these changes manually, a more common approach is to gather this information using configuration management software, such as CiscoWorks 2000, HP Network Automation, ERAMON and Infosim. Opmantek and WhatsUp Gold uses Simple Network Management Protocol and Windows Management Instrumentation to collect application performance management, configuration management and infrastructure management information. Open source solutions are also available like Open-AudIT.

==Accounting management==
The goal is to gather usage statistics for users.

Accounting management is concerned with tracking network utilization information, such that individual users, departments, or business units can be appropriately billed or charged for accounting purposes. While this may not be applicable to all companies, in many larger organizations, the IT department is considered a cost center that accrues revenues according to resource utilization by individual departments or business units.
For non-billed networks, &quot;administration&quot; replaces &quot;accounting&quot;. The goals of administration are to administer the set of authorized users by establishing users, passwords, and permissions, and to administer the operations of the equipment such as by performing software backup and synchronization.

Accounting is often referred to as billing management. Using the statistics, the users can be billed and usage quotas can be enforced. These can be disk usage, link utilization, CPU time, etc.

==Performance management==
Performance management is focused on ensuring that network performance remains at acceptable levels. It enables the manager to prepare the network for the future, as well as to determine the efficiency of the current network, for example, in relation to the investments done to set it up. The network performance addresses the throughput, network response times, packet loss rates, link utilization, percentage utilization, error rates and so forth.

This information is usually gathered through the implementation of an SNMP management system, either actively monitored, or configured to alert administrators when performance moves above or below predefined thresholds. Actively monitoring current network performance is an important step in identifying problems before they occur, as part of a proactive network management strategy. By collecting and analysing performance data, the network health can be monitored. Trends can indicate capacity or reliability issues before they affect services. Also, performance thresholds can be set in order to trigger an alarm. The alarm would be handled by the normal fault management process (see above). Alarms vary depending upon the severity of the problem. Tivoli Netcool/Proviso by IBM, CA Performance Management by CA Technologies, opEvents by Opmantek and SolarWinds are some of the products used for performance monitoring.

==Security management==
Security management is the process of controlling access to assets in the network. Data security can be achieved mainly with authentication and encryption. Authorization to it configured with OS and DBMS access control settings.

Security management is not only concerned with ensuring that a network environment is secure, but also that gathered security-related information is analyzed regularly. Security management functions include managing network authentication, authorization, and auditing, such that both internal and external users only have access to appropriate network resources. Other common tasks include the configuration and management of network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security policies (such as access lists). Network elements keep log files, which are examined during a security audit. Many telecommunications network elements produce a security alarm when a security violation is suspected. This will be monitored along with all other alarms in the normal alarm surveillance function of fault management. Technicians in a network operations center will see this immediately and take appropriate action.

== Network management system ==
In terms of the network management model, a network management station (NMS) is one that executes network management applications (NMAs) that monitor and control network elements (NE) such as hosts, gateways and terminal servers. These network elements use a management agent (MA) to perform the network management functions requested by the network management stations. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to communicate management information between the network management stations and the agents in the network elements. NMS is described in RFC 1157 &quot;A Simple Network Management Protocol&quot;.

An NMS provides FCAPS functionality for the whole network. FCAPS: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security, are the categories defined by the ISO model. In non-billing organizations accounting is sometimes replaced with administration.

Looking into the industry aspects, there are various players in the market like Nokia - NetAct, IBM - NetCool or Opmantek. Open source NMS solutions are also available like NMIS or OpenNMS.

<text>Telefunken was a German radio and television producer, founded in Berlin in 1903 as a joint venture between Siemens &amp; Halske and the &quot;Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft&quot; (AEG) (&quot;General electricity company&quot;).
Prior to World War I, the company set up the first world-wide network of communications and was the first in the world to sell electronic televisions with cathode-ray tubes, in Germany in 1934.

The brand had several incarnations:
* &quot;Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie m.b.H., System Telefunken&quot;, founded in 1903 as a joint venture between AEG and Siemens &amp; Halske
* &quot;Telefunken, Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie m.b.H.&quot;, in 1923; since 1941 as subsidiary of AEG alone
* &quot;Telefunken GmbH&quot;, in 1955
* &quot;Telefunken Aktiengesellschaft (AG)&quot;, in 1963
* &quot;Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft AEG-Telefunken&quot;, created in 1967 through a merger between Telefunken and AEG
* AEG-TELEFUNKEN AG, in 1979
The company also had several subsidiaries and spin-offs of its own:
* &quot;TELEFUNKEN Fernseh und Rundfunk GmbH&quot;, formed in 1972 in Hanover as a subsidiary of AEG-TELEFUNKEN
* Telefunken electronic GmbH, a spin-off of AEG-Telefunken and DASA
* , since 1992
* , formed in Heilbronn in 2009
* Telefunken Lighting technologies S.L., since 2009

The company Telefunken USA was incorporated in early 2001 to provide restoration services and build reproductions of vintage Telefunken microphones.

In 2023, Telefunken brand was acquired by the advisory and investment firm Gordon Brothers.

==History==


Around the start of the 20th century, two groups of German researchers worked on the development of techniques for wireless communication. The one group at AEG, led by Adolf Slaby and Georg Graf von Arco, developed systems for the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;; the other one, under Karl Ferdinand Braun, at Siemens, for the German Army. Their main competitor was the British Marconi Company.

When a dispute concerning patents arose between the two companies, Kaiser Wilhelm II urged both parties to join efforts, creating Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie System Telefunken (&quot;The Company for Wireless Telegraphy Ltd.&quot;) joint venture on 27 May 1903, with the disputed patents and techniques invested in it. On 17 April 1923, it was renamed &quot;Telefunken, The Company for Wireless Telegraphy&quot;. Telefunken was the company&#x27;s telegraphic address. The first technical director of Telefunken was Count Georg von Arco.

Telefunken rapidly became a major player in the radio and electronics fields, both civilian and military. Prior to World War I the company set up the first world wide network of communications and during the war they supplied radio sets and telegraphy equipment for the military, as well as building one of the first radio navigation systems for the Zeppelin force. The Telefunken Kompass Sender operated from 1908 to 1918, allowing the Zeppelins to navigate throughout the North Sea area in any weather.

In 1911 Telefunken built a wireless station in West Sayville just north of the Long Island Rail Road tracks. A 500-foot tower that could be raised and lowered rose from a ball and socket joint atop a concrete foundation. It was completed in 1912 and wireless messages could then be transmitted to a similar tower in Nauen 3,500 miles away. From August 1, 1914, until April 6, 1917, the United States monitored messages sent over the Telefunken wireless and the United States Marine Corps guarded the station. After the U.S. declared war the station was sealed off, the wire fence surrounding it was charged with electricity, and floodlights were placed throughout. After World War I it was taken over by Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company and later the Federal Aviation Administration. It was demolished in 1938.

Starting in 1923, Telefunken built broadcast transmitters and radio sets. In 1928, Telefunken made history by designing the V-41 amplifier for the German Radio Network. This was the very first two-stage, &quot;Hi-Fi&quot; amplifier. Over time, Telefunken perfected their designs and in 1950 the V-72 amplifier was developed. The TAB (a manufacturing subcontractor to Telefunken) V-72 soon became popular with other radio stations and recording facilities. The V-72S was the only type of amplifier found in the REDD.37 console used by the Beatles at Abbey Road Studios on many of their early recordings. In 1932, record players were added to the product line.

In 1941, Siemens transferred its Telefunken shares to AEG as part of the agreements known as the &quot;Telefunken settlement&quot;, and AEG thus became the sole owner and continued to lead Telefunken as a subsidiary (starting in 1955 as &quot;Telefunken GmbH&quot; and from 1963 as &quot;Telefunken AG&quot;).

During the Second World War, Telefunken was a supplier of vacuum tubes, transmitters and radio relay systems, and developed Funkmess facilities (later referred to as radar devices by the US Navy) and directional finders, as part of the German air defence against aerial bombing. During the war, manufacturing plants were shifted to and developed in west of Germany or relocated. Thus, Telefunken, under AEG, turned into the smaller subsidiary, with the three divisions realigning and data processing technology, elements as well as broadcast, television and phono. Telefunken was also the originator of the FM radio broadcast system. Telefunken, through the subsidiary company Teldec (a joint venture with Decca Records), was for many decades one of the largest German record companies, until Teldec was sold to WEA in 1988.

In 1959, Telefunken established a modern semiconductor works in Heilbronn, where in April 1960 production began. The works was expanded several times, and in 1970 a new 6-storey building was built at the northern edge of the area. At the beginning of the 1970s it housed approximately 2,500 employees.

In 1967, Telefunken was merged with AEG, which was then renamed to AEG-Telefunken. In the beginning of the 1960s, Walter Bruch developed the PAL-colour television system for the company, in use by most countries of the western Hemisphere (except the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the western part of South America). PAL is established i.e. in the United Kingdom (PAL-I) and, except France, many other European countries -–also in Brazil (PAL-M), Argentina (PAL-N), South Africa, India and Australia.

The mainframe computer TR 4 was developed at Telefunken in Backnang, and the model was developed at Telefunken in Konstanz, including the first ball-based mouse named Rollkugel in 1968. The computers were in use at many German university computing centres from the 1970s to around 1985. The development and manufacture of large computers was separated in 1974 to the Konstanz Computer Company (CGK). The production of mini- and process computers was integrated into the automatic control engineering division of AEG. When AEG was bought by Daimler in 1985, &quot;Telefunken&quot; was dropped from the company name.

In 1995, Telefunken was sold to Tech Sym Corporation (owners of Continental Electronics Corporation of Dallas) for $9 million. However, Telefunken remained a German company.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, Telefunken was also instrumental in the development of high quality audio noise reduction systems, including (marketed since 1975), High Com (marketed since 1978), High Com II, High Com III, High Com FM, and CX (1982).

In 2005, Telefunken Sender Systeme Berlin changed its name to Transradio SenderSysteme Berlin AG. The name &quot;Transradio&quot; dates back to 1918, when Transradio was founded as a subsidiary of Telefunken. A year later, in 1919, Transradio made history by introducing duplex transmission. Transradio has specialized in research, development and design of modern AM, VHF/FM and DRM broadcasting systems.

In August 2006, it was acquired by the Turkish company Profilo Telra, one of the largest European manufacturers of TV-devices, with brand-owner &quot;Telefunken Licenses GmbH&quot; granting a license for the Telefunken trademark rights and producing televisions under that name.

==Locations and manufacturing plants==

Into the 1930s years, production was made after a distributor in the workshops of the two parent companies. The company headquarters was located in Berlin Kreuzberg, Hallesches Ufer 30 (1918–1937).

The first commercially made electronic television sets with cathode-ray tubes were manufactured by Telefunken in Berlin in 1932.

Starting from 1938, manufacturing and developing plants were concentrated at the new headquarters (until 1945) in Berlin Zehlendorf, Goerzallee.

During the Second World War, there were further manufacturing plants in the Berlin area, in Thuringia, Saxony, Moravia, Silesia, on Rügen. In addition, in Baltic countries at Tallinn and Riga, and in occupied areas of Poland at Kraków and Łódź, floats and works were established. The vacuum tube factory Łódź was shifted with the staff in August 1944 to Ulm (Fortress Wilhelmsburg).

After the Second World War, new firm locations for development and production were established. The company headquarters was located first in Berlin-Schöneberg (1945–1948), then in Berlin-Kreuzberg (1948–1952), Berlin-Moabit (1952–1960) and Berlin Charlottenburg (1960–1967).

<text>Hongkou (; formerly spelled Hongkew) is a district of Shanghai, forming part of the northern urban core. It has a land area of and a population of 757,498 as of 2020. The district borders Yangpu to the east, Pudong to the southeast, Huangpu to the southwest, Jing&#x27;an to the west and Baoshan to the north.

It is the location of the Astor House Hotel, Broadway Mansions, Lu Xun Park, and Hongkou Football Stadium. It was once known as Shanghai&#x27;s &quot;Little Tokyo.&quot; Hongkou is home to the Shanghai International Studies University, the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, and the 1933 Old Millfun.

== History ==
During the Tang dynasty, the area in modern Hongkou District may have been a beach included in a seawall (捍海塘) near the East China Sea. In the early Ming dynasty, it became known as 黃埔口 (Huangpukou) or 洪口 (Hongkou), as there is a river mouth debouched into the Huangpu River, in the early Qing dynasty, it was renamed as 虹口 (Hongkou).

In 1845, an American bishop W. J. Boone bought an area of land there, and it later evolved into the American Concession in Shanghai in 1848 and merged into the International Concession in 1863, it was in large part reduced to rubble during the Second World war when Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese. 20,000 Ashkenazi Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe lived in an overcrowded square-mile section known to as the Shanghai Ghetto, in the Tilanqiao neighborhood of Hongkew.

In 1947, it was renamed as Hongkou District.

<text>The Mid-Canada Line (MCL), also known as the McGill Fence, was a line of radar stations running east–west across the middle of Canada, used to provide early warning of a Soviet bomber attack on North America. It was built to supplement the Pinetree Line, which was located farther south. The majority of Mid-Canada Line stations were used only briefly from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, as the attack threat changed from bombers to ICBMs. As the MCL was closed down, the early warning role passed almost entirely to the newer and more capable DEW Line farther north.

The MCL was based on the bistatic radar principle, using separated transmitters and receivers. An aircraft flying anywhere between the stations would reflect some of the transmitted signal towards the receiver, where it would mix with the signal travelling directly from the transmitter. The mixing of the two signals produces a pattern that is very easy to detect using simple electronics. As the transmitter is not pulsed, it does not require high voltages and is very simple as well. This leads to a very low-cost system that can cover huge areas, at the cost of providing no information about the precise location of the target, only its presence.

Throughout its history, the MCL suffered from a problem that was never solved; because of the way bistatic radar works, any object relatively close to either station produces a large signal, in contrast to conventional monostatic (single site) radars where this effect is limited to the area immediately around the site. In the case of the MCL, this caused problems when flocks of birds would fly anywhere near either station and swamp the signal of a more distant aircraft. Solving this problem using the Doppler effect was a major design criterion for the AN/FPS-23 &quot;Fluttar&quot; that filled a similar role in the DEW line.

==History==

===Impetus===
Construction of the Pinetree Line had only just started when air planners started to have concerns about its capabilities and siting. By the time it detected a potential attack by jet-powered aircraft, there would be little time to do anything before the attack reached Canadian or northern U.S. cities. Additionally, the Pinetree systems used pulsed radars that were fairly easy to jam and were unable to detect targets close to the ground due to &quot;clutter.&quot; Although expensive in terms of fuel use, it would be possible for Soviet bombers to evade detection by flying lower and plotting a course between the stations.

Bennett Lewis, head of the AECL Chalk River Laboratories and former Chief Superintendent of the UK Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) had proposed to the Defence Research Board (DRB) a system that avoided both of these problems. Known today as a forward scatter bistatic radar, it used two antennas, a transmitter and receiver, separated by some distance. The antennas were positioned and aimed so that the signal from the transmitter filled the space above the line between the two stations. An aircraft flying into this region would reflect some signal back towards the receiver, allowing detection at altitudes as great as 65,000 ft.

A major advantage of the system is that it requires much less power to operate effectively. In a conventional radar, the radio signal has to travel to the target and back again. As each leg of the journey is subject to the inverse square law, the resulting radar equation contains a fourth-power dependence. In contrast, a forward-scatter radar signal always travels about the same total distance, from the transmitter to the receiver, modified only by the altitude of the target. This means it is dependent on the square root of range and not the fourth root, and thus delivers considerably more energy onto the receiver than a conventional radar over the same range. Also, unlike a conventional &quot;monostatic&quot; radar, the transmitter did not have to turn off to allow the receiver to listen for the signal. Since the total amount of energy received at the receiver is a function of both the peak power and the length of the pulse, using a continual signal means the same total energy will be deposited using much lower peak transmitter power. As a result, Lewis&#x27; system would require smaller sites and much less power than conventional radars like those of the Pinetree Line.

The major disadvantage of the system is that it did not indicate the aircraft&#x27;s location within the beam, unlike a pulsed system where pulse timing can be used to determine range. This means the forward-scatter concept is useful for making a &quot;radar fence&quot; or &quot;trip wire&quot; that indicates that something is approaching, but not exactly where it is. To help address locating the target to a degree, the proposal was to build two interlinked fences, so that each pair of stations was perhaps apart, a short enough distance that the radar on an interceptor aircraft would be able to find the target within that area. Using two overlapping sets also allowed one pair to cover the dead zone directly above the towers of the other.

Lewis&#x27; initial concept was to place the transmitters and receivers on telephone poles and electric power transmission towers, which provided both a convenient location as well as the small amount of power needed to run the electronics. In the case of the telephone poles, the lines would also be used to send the data back to the tracking stations. This concept generated a considerable amount of interest, although it was abandoned for reasons that are not entirely clear. Willis and Griffiths speculate it might be the need for 1,000 such radars, but it is also likely that the desired to locate the line further north than the heavily settled areas in southern Canada was likely significant as well. In any event, the simplicity of the concept helped bring it to the attention of air planners.

===Spider Web===

The DRB decided to pursue Lewis’ idea in 1950–51 by directing a research contract to the Eaton Electronics Research Laboratories of McGill University, headed by Professor Garfield Woonton. Lewis suggested to DRB and Woonton that he put the project in the hands of associate professor, J. Rennie Whitehead as project leader, a former colleague of his from the TRE days in the UK who had recently taken a position at the Lab. Some preliminary tests were made in 1952 with breadboard hardware built by a graduate student, Hugh Hamilton, in order to confirm the validity of the idea.

In the meantime RCA Victor had been brought in by the DRB to design and produce the receivers, transmitters and antennas for tests on a substantial scale. The testing was performed in the summer of 1953, when Whitehead and his team of RCA Victor and RCAF personnel installed and operated a string of seven stations stretching from Ottawa to Mattawa along the Ottawa River valley. Known under the code name of &quot;Spider Web&quot; at the suggestion of Hamilton, the tests were made with aircraft from CFB St. Hubert, near Montreal. All observations were transmitted to and made in the line HQ, which was set up in the equipment hut of one of the seven stations, located in Deep River.

Flight Lieutenant Andrew Matthews of the 104 Communications Flight at RCAF St. Hubert arranged for a series of different aircraft to fly through the network, including an Auster light aircraft, a T-33 Shooting Star, an Avro Lancaster bomber and even a recently acquired de Havilland Comet jet transport. The tests revealed a great deal about the spectral ‘signatures’ of aircraft crossing the line at different points, and demonstrated the capability to detect all sizes of aircraft from 100 ft to over 40,000 ft in altitude. During this time Dr. Ross Warren of RCA Victor and Dr. Whitehead jointly developed the theoretical background for the work in a major report to DRB.

The Spider Web trials were followed in 1954 by intensive tests on a single wide link, built in the Eastern Townships by Bell Canada, who had by this time been given the go-ahead for the implementation of the Mid-Canada Line. When Whitehead inquired why RCA had not been given the contract, a colleague replied &quot;Who do you think runs Canada?&quot; The trials on this prototype link were also conducted by Whitehead and a small team in collaboration with Air Defence Command, St. Hubert, this time on behalf of Bell. The trials involved the flyover of numbers of B-52 bombers by arrangement with Strategic Air Command and a local bombplot unit. They also had full-time use of an Avro Lancaster from CFB Greenwood for the important low-level tests.

===Deployment studies===
In February 1953 the Canada-U.S. Military Study Group (MSG) was asked &quot;to study those aspects of the North American Air Defence System in general, and the early warning system in particular, which are of mutual concern to the two countries.&quot; The MSG then asked the air defence commanders of Canada and the United States to prepare independent briefs on the subject. By July 1953, RCAF Air Defense Command had completed its brief, followed shortly thereafter by its USAF counterpart. Both reports suggested building a Doppler fence farther north, along the 55th parallel, roughly at the entrance of James Bay into Hudson Bay.

In October 1953 the MSG recommended to both governments &quot;that there be established at the earliest practicable date, an early warning line located generally along the 55th parallel between Alaska and Newfoundland&quot;, and outlined their minimum operational requirements. By the end of November 1953, the Mid-Canada Line had been approved in principle. Unlike the jointly-operated Pinetree line and future DEW line, the Mid-Canada line would be funded and operated entirely by the RCAF. The DRB estimated that the system would cost about $69,700,000, while an independent RCAF report placed it at $85,000,000, .

In December an effort started to try to understand what sort of problems would be encountered during construction. Several &quot;trains&quot; consisting of tractor-pulled sleighs set out cross-country. One, manned by the RCAF, set out eastward from Fort Nelson, BC in order to link up with a second moving west from Flin Flon, Manitoba, while a third crewed by the Army left Lake Nipigon near Thunder Bay, Ontario for Lansdowne House about further north. The missions proved that it was possible to build the new line, but only during the winter when the muskeg was frozen solid. These missions also inspired the U.S. Army to invest in purpose-built overland trains which they experimented with in the 1960s but never put into production.

While that was taking place, efforts were underway to start primary siting studies. It quickly became clear that the areas in question, at least in eastern Canada, were so remote that there was no really accurate topographical information. A huge effort to map the area in a 15-mile wide strip across the entire country was started by Transport Command almost immediately, and ended by the spring of 1954. With this information in hand a construction division was set up, the Systems Engineering Group (SEG), in February 1954, tasked with producing a final report on the system to be submitted on June 1.

===Finalizing the plans===

As the experiments continued it became clear that by using taller masts, tall, the radar stations could be located further apart, up to . This reduced the number of stations required. Nevertheless, the price rose, now estimated at about $120,000,000. Although their final report was not yet ready, the SEG put in an interim report in June and it was approved by cabinet by the end of the month.

In their report they outlined the system that would be built almost exactly. It called for eight major &quot;Sector Control Centres&quot;, numbered from 200 to 900, each of which control up to thirty unmanned radar sites for a total of 90 radar stations. Each of the radar stations consisted of a single tall mast with a number of small dishes in fixed positions on top (typically four, two pointed in either direction), with power and electronics located in a building beside the base of the mast.

The sector control centres were linked using an advanced microwave communications system developed in part by CARDE, which scattered off the troposphere for long-distance communications. The southernmost site along the eastern portion of the line, at Cape Henrietta Maria on Hudson Bay, was used as the main communications point, with three additional repeater stations transferring data from the line southward to the NORAD command center in North Bay, Ontario. The easternmost station at Hopedale, Labrador was co-located with an existing Pinetree Line station in order to save construction costs.

All aircraft transiting the line would have to file a flight plan through the &quot;Mid Identification Zone&quot;, or &quot;MIDIZ&quot;, centred on the fence. The plans also called for the construction of several airbases known as &quot;Line Clearance Aerodromes&quot; just to the north of the line, where interceptor aircraft could operate in times of heightened alert.

At about this time another huge civil engineering project was underway in Canada, the construction of a cross-Canada microwave relay telephone system. Since many of the logistics problems were similar, the construction group, led by Bell Canada, was selected as a major contractor for the base construction. Detailed site selection started in 1955, with a major surveying effort running across Canada at the 55th parallel. The sites were so remote that the RCAF had to form up its first all-helicopter squadron in order to provide flight support for the survey teams.

==Construction and service==
Construction started in 1956 and proceeded quickly. By April 1957 the eastern half was operational, and the line was declared fully operational on January 1, 1958. Operations were shortly integrated into the newly formed NORAD. Even the SEG&#x27;s revised estimates turned out to be too low, and the fence&#x27;s final cost is estimated at $224,566,830, .

Almost as soon as the units went into operation, a serious problem was seen. Due to the large radar cross sections seen in forward-scattering radars, even small targets produced detectable signals. This was multiplied if the targets were roughly the same size as the wavelength of the radar, or in this case, tended to be spread out in patterns that were multiples of that wavelength. This problem was triggered by the large flocks of migrating waterfowl during the spring and fall, which created signals so powerful that it rendered the radars useless. Testing on the Spider Web and Eastern Townships systems had both been carried out during the summer, so this had not been noticed.

Even before the line became operational, in a repeat of earlier history, a new and more capable line was already under study that would combine the plotting capability of the Pinetree system with the line-breaking capabilities of the MCL, and located much farther north to dramatically improve the detection and response times. Emerging as the Distant Early Warning Line, or DEW, construction started before the MCL had become operational. When the DEW line became operational in 1957, the value of the MCL was eroded, and the RCAF started pressing for it to be dismantled.

Although technically capable, the MCL gave little information for vectoring interceptors to their targets, so these tasks still required the Pinetree radars much farther south. The extra time offered by the MCL was not considered worth the trouble of keeping the line operational. The USAF disagreed, but in spite of their objections, the western half of the line was shut down in January 1964, leaving the eastern half to help defend the industrial areas of Canada and the US. As the Soviet Union moved their offensive capability to ICBMs it became clear that both the MCL and Pinetree systems were of limited use, and the entire Mid-Canada line was shut down in April 1965. The operations site located at Cranberry Portage, Manitoba, for example, has been converted into a high school and residence since active operations at the site closed in the mid-1960s.

The DEW line stations were sited to provide the best possible view of the horizon, but there remained a minimum detection angle below which aircraft could sneak by without being seen. During early planning, a system like the MCL&#x27;s towers was considered as gap-fillers between the stations to prevent these sorts of intrusions. As the MCL came online and the problem with birds became clear, the original forward-scatter concept was replaced by one using Doppler filtering to ignore anything flying below . These AN/FPS-23 &quot;Fluttar&quot; systems did indeed filter out birds, but failed to filter out the general aviation aircraft flying in the area, including those flying base-to-base for servicing and crew rotations. As a result, the false-alarm rate rendered it just as ineffective as the MCL, and it lasted even a shorter time, shut down in 1963.

==Stations==
From a December 1956 listing:


==POL Supply Points==
Petroleums, Oils and Lubricants (POL) Supply Points were distribution centers for consumable petroleum materials used to fuel and maintain the Mid-Canada Line DDS sites. Co-located with Sector Control Stations when possible, petroleum products were received in bulk and shipped out by air from these locations. From the same December 1956 listing.

<text>The Rajputana Agency was a political office of the British Indian Empire dealing with a collection of native states in Rajputana (now in Rajasthan, northwestern India), under the political charge of an Agent reporting directly to the Governor-General of India and residing at Mount Abu in the Aravalli Range. The total area of the states falling within the Rajputana Agency was , with eighteen states and two estates or chiefships.

== Subdivisions and (e)states ==

* Mewar Residency, with headquarters at Udaipur, dealt with the state of Mewar (title Maharana of Udaipur), a salute state entitled to a hereditary gun salute of 19 guns (21 local).
* Southern Rajputana States Agency, which was part of Mewar Residency until 1906, when it was separated, covered three salute states:
** Banswara, title Maharawal, hereditary 15 guns
** Dungarpur, title Maharawal, hereditary 15 guns 
** Pratapgarh, title Maharawal, hereditary 15 guns
* Jaipur Residency, with headquarters at Jaipur, dealt with two salute states:
** Jaipur, title Maharaja, hereditary 17 guns (19 local)
** Kishangarh, title Maharaja, hereditary 15 guns
** as well as the Thikana (estate) of Lawa.
* Western Rajputana States Residency, with its headquarters at Jodhpur, dealt with: 
** Jodhpur, title Maharaja, hereditary salute of 17 guns (19 local)
** Jaisalmer, title Maharawal, hereditary salute of 15 guns
** Sirohi, title Maharao, hereditary salute of 15 guns
* Bikaner Agency, with headquarters at Bikaner, dealt with the salute state of Bikaner, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 17 guns (19 local)
* Alwar Agency, with headquarters at Alwar, dealt with the salute state of Alwar, title Maharaja, hereditary salute of 15 guns (17 local)
* Eastern Rajputana States Agency, with headquarters at Bharatpur, dealt with :
** Bharatpur, Jat, title Maharaja, hereditary salute of 17 guns (19 local)
** Karauli, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 17 guns
** Dholpur, Jat, title Maharaj Rana, hereditary salute of 15 guns (17 personal)
* Haraoti-Tonk Agency, with headquarters at Deoli, dealt with: 
** Bundi title Maharao, hereditary salute of 17 guns
** Tonk, Muslim, title Nawab, hereditary salute of 17 guns
** Shahpura, title Raja, hereditary salute of 9 guns.
* Kotah-Jhalawar Agency, with headquarters at Kota, dealt with: 
** Kota(h), title Maharaja, hereditary salute of 17 guns (19 personal) 
** Jhalawar, title Maharaj Rana, hereditary salute of 13 guns [15 Personal]
*Sarwar state (title Maharaja)and Ajmer (title Maharaja in 1198) ruled by the Gaur rajput dynasty, their dynasty ruled the Sheopur, Rajgarh, Fatehgarh, Bulandshahr, Sarwari and many more states and estates.
The small British province of Ajmer-Merwara was also included within the geographical area of Rajputana, but that was under direct British rule.

== Population and dynasties ==
All of the princely states had Hindu rulers, except Tonk, which had a Muslim ruler, most being Rajputs, except two in Eastern Rajputana, Bharatpur State and Dholpur State, which had Jat rulers. 
Although Rajputs ruled most of the states, they comprised a small minority of the population; in the 1901 census, of a total population of 9,723,301, only 620,229 were Rajputs, who were numerically strongest in the northern states and in Udaipur and Tarangagadh.

Other important castes and tribes of Rajputana were the Charans, known as poet-historians and administrators in princely states; the Brahmins, who traditionally performed priestly functions, and were numerous and influential; the Bhats, who were the keepers of secular tradition and of the genealogies; the Hindu mercantile castes; Jains, who comprised the majority of the merchants; the agricultural groups, such as the Jats and the Gurjars, the tribal peoples, Bhils, Meenas and Meo. In the 1901 census, 7,035,093 persons, or more than 72% of the total population spoke one of the Rajasthani languages.

== Rulers ==

In the eleventh century, Rajputana was ruled by a number of local dynasties, Chief of these were the Gurjara Pratiharas, who ruled at Kanauj; the Paramaras of Malwa; the Chauhans and Gaur dynasty of Ajmer; the Bamraulia of Dholpur; the Chaulukya (Solankis) of Anhilwara in Gujarat; Mahawar koli of (Rajasthan); the Guhilots with the Sisodia of Udaipur (Mewar); the Rathores of Marwar (Jodhpur); and the Kachwaha clan of Jaipur. The Rathore, Chauhan, Sisodia and Kachwahas ruled until Indian independence. In 14th century great Maharana Kumbha ruled over entire Mewar region for 34 years after defeating various Islamic Sultans many times. He built the Vijay Stambha (Tower of Victory) to commemorate his victories against Islamic Sultans. Colonel James Tod called Vijay Stambha one of finest examples of Hindu Rajput architecture. In 16th century the Rajputs first allied &amp; then faced off with foreigner Babur, founder of the Mughal empire at Fatehpur Sikri in 1527. Some clans chose to conciliate with Akbar, except for the Sisodia clan, which, however, conciliated with Jahangir in 1616. Many Mughal Kings sought refuge from the friendly allied Rajput kings during internal conflicts or while on the run; e.g. Akbar was born at the Rajput Fortress of Amarkot in Rajputana (in modern-day Sindh), where his parents had been given refuge by the local Hindu ruler Rana Prasad. From Jahangir&#x27;s accession to Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707, a period of 100 years, many Rajput kings allied with Mughals although some states did rebel like Bundelas against Shah Jahan, Mewar&#x27;s great Maharana Pratap against Akbar and Mewar and Marwar against Aurangzeb. In the 16th century Jat power arose and they fought against Aurangzeb in battle of Tilpat. After death of Gokula Singh Raja Ram Jat looted Akbar&#x27;s tomb and exhumed Akbar&#x27;s bones and burned them. After Aurangzeb&#x27;s death, the invasion of the Marathas and Nader Shah of Iran led to a triple alliance among the three leading Rajput chiefs, which internal jealousy so weakened that the Marathas, having been called in by the Rathors to aid them, took possession of Ajmer about 1756. By the end of the century nearly the whole of Eastern Rajputana had been aligned with Marathas. The Second Anglo-Maratha War distracted the Marathas from 1807 to 1809. In 1817 the British went to war with the Pindaris, raiders who were based in Maratha territory, which quickly became the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the British government offered its protection to the Rajput rulers from the Pindaris and the Marathas. The Pindari were defeated, and the Afghan adventurer Amir Khan submitted and signed a treaty with the British, making him the ruler of Tonk. By the end of 1818 similar treaties had been executed between the other Rajput states and Britain. The Maratha Sindhia ruler of Gwalior gave up the district of Ajmer-Merwara to the British, and Maratha influence in Rajasthan came to an end. Most of the Jat and Rajput princes remained loyal to Britain in the Revolt of 1857, and few political changes were made in Rajputana until Indian independence in 1947. The Rajput kings were some of the most loyal allies of British Empire during the Revolt of 1857, World War I, &amp; World War II.

== Statistical overview ==
== Economy ==

In the time of the British Raj, the majority of the people were occupied in agriculture. In the large towns banking and commerce flourished. In the north, the staple products for export were salt, grain, wool and cotton, and in the south opium and cotton. The major imports included sugar, hardware and piece goods. Rajputana had relatively little industrial production. The principal manufactures were cotton and woolen goods, metalwork, ivory carving, and other handicrafts which were chiefly carried on in the eastern states. The system of agriculture was very simple; in the drier country west of the Aravalli Range only one crop was raised in the year, while in other parts south and east of the Aravallis two crops were raised annually, and various kinds of cereals, pulses and fibres are grown. In the desert tracts fine breeds of camels, cattle, horses and sheep were to be found wherever there is pasturage. Irrigation, mostly from wells, was almost confined to the northern portion. Rajputana was traversed throughout by the Rajputana railway, with its Malwa branch in the south, and diverging to Agra and Delhi in the north. Jodhpur, Udaipur and Bikaner had constructed branch railways at their own cost, the first of which was extended in 1901 to Hyderabad in Sindh. In 1909 another line was opened running north near the eastern boundary from Kotah to Bharatpur.

<text>The Commodore 65 (also known as the C64DX) is a prototype computer created at Commodore Business Machines in 1990–1991. It is an improved version of the Commodore 64, and it was meant to be backwards-compatible with the older computer, while still providing a number of advanced features close to those of the Amiga.

== History ==
In September 1989 &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; noted that &quot;Sales of the 64 have diminished rapidly, Nintendo has eaten big holes in the market, and the life of the old warhorse computer should somehow be extended.&quot; Noting that Apple had developed the IIGS to extend the life of its Apple II line, the magazine asked &quot;Will Commodore take the same tack?&quot;, then continued:

The &quot;Gazette&quot; added, &quot;Our sources also report that there is a great deal of infighting at Commodore as to whether the machine should be released. The sales staff wants to get the machine out the door, while the naysaying engineers have dubbed it &#x27;son of Plus/4.&#x27;&quot; While the next issue reported that &quot;the latest rumor is that such a machine will never see the light of day&quot;, Fred Bowen and others at Commodore in 1990–1991 developed the Commodore 65 (C65) as a successor to the C64. In the end of 1990 the decision to create the C65 was taken. The project was cancelled by Commodore&#x27;s chairman Irving Gould in 1991.

When Commodore International was liquidated in 1994, a number of prototypes were sold on the open market, and thus a few people actually own a Commodore 65. Estimates as to the actual number of machines found on the open market range from 50 to 2000 units. As the C65 project was cancelled, the final 8-bit offering from CBM remained the triple-mode, 1–2 MHz, 128 KB (expandable), C64-compatible Commodore 128 of 1985.

== Technical specifications ==
* The CPU named CSG 4510 R3 is a custom CSG 65CE02 (a MOS 6502 derivative), combined with two MOS 6526 complex interface adapters (CIAs), a UART serial interface, and a memory mapper to allow for an addressable space of 1 MB
* 3.54 MHz clock frequency (the C64 runs at 1 MHz)
* A new VIC-III graphics chip named CSG 4567 R5, capable of producing 256 colors from a palette of 4096 colors; available modes include 320×200×256 (8), 640×200×16 (4), 640×400×16 (4), 1280×200×4 (2), and 1280×400×4 (2) ( X×Y×color depth, i.e. number of colors (bit planes) )
** Supports all video modes of VIC-II
** Text mode with 40/80 × 25 characters
** Synchronizable with external video source (genlock)
** Integrated DMA controller (bit blit)
* Two CSG 8580R5 SID sound chips producing stereo sound (the C64 has one SID)
** Separate control (left / right) for volume, filter and modulation
* 128 KB RAM, expandable with up to 1 MB using a RAM expansion port similar to that of the Commodore Amiga 500
* 128 KB ROM
* Heavily improved BASIC: Commodore BASIC 10.0 (the C64 has the relatively feature-weak BASIC 2.0, which was almost 10 years old by this time.)
* One internal 3½&quot; DSDD floppy disk drive
* Keyboard with 77 keys and an inverted T directional cursor block

Bottom flap:

* RAM expansion

Dimensions: ≈46 cm wide, 20 cm deep, 5.1 cm high

===Chipset names===
The custom chips of the C65 were not meant to have names like the custom chips in the Amiga. Although there are names printed near the chip sockets on various revisions of the circuit board, they were not intended as names for the chips. According to former Commodore engineer Bill Gardei,The Legend on the PCB was to let others in the organization know [whom] to go to for advice on the chips. We did have an issue with that. But that wasn&#x27;t the name of the chip at the time. The 4567 was always called the VIC-3. I can see why others outside of Commodore made the connection. But again—no—we never called these chips &quot;Victor&quot; or &quot;Bill&quot;.The custom chips for the C65 are:

* CSG 4510: processor (commonly called &quot;Victor&quot; after Victor Andrade)
* CSG 4567: VIC-III graphics processor (commonly called &quot;Bill&quot; after Bill Gardei)
* CSG 4151: DMAgic DMA controller (designed by Paul Lassa)
* F011C: FDC (floppy disk controller, also designed by Bill Gardei)

The C65 also contains one or two programmable logic arrays depending on the version:

* ELMER: PAL16L8 (C65 versions 1.1, 2A, 2B), PAL20L8 (C65 versions 3–5)
* IGOR: PAL16L8 (C65 version 2B only)

===Graphics subsystem===
The main memory of the C65 is shared between the graphics subsystem and the CPU. The memory clock runs at almost twice the speed of the C64. To further increase the bandwidth of the graphics subsystem, the memory is divided into 2× 8-bit wide banks of 64 Kbyte which can be accessed by the CSG-4567 simultaneously. This provides an effective video-DMA bandwidth of 7.2 MB/s which is the same specification as the original 16-bit Commodore Amiga chipset (OCS/ECS). The CPU can use up to half the available bandwidth, since it can only access a single 8-bit bank at a time. In higher demanding video modes, the CPU is slowed down due to increased cycle stealing from the video controller.

====Enhanced VIC-II modes====
In addition to having all of the C64 video modes, the CSG-4567 also supports several new character attributes such as &quot;blink&quot; or &quot;bold&quot; and can display any of the new or old video modes in 80 column or 640 horizontal pixel format, as well as the older 40 column 320 pixel format [6]. These enhanced &quot;VIC-II&quot; modes take up to 16 KB of system RAM. The sprite capabilities in all VIC modes are equivalent to the C64.

=====Bitplane modes=====
A new &quot;bitplane&quot; video mode was added to allow the displaying of true bitplane type video, with-up to eight bitplanes in 320 pixel mode and up to four in 640 pixel mode. The CSG-4567 can also time-multiplex the bitplanes to give a true four-color 1280 pixel picture. Vertical resolution is maintained at 200 lines as standard, but can be doubled to 400 with interlace [6]. The VIC-III bitplane modes take up to 64 KB of system RAM in non-interlaced or 128 KB RAM in interlaced (400 line) modes. Since the C65 is equipped with only 128 KB in its basic configuration, these modes would consume the entire RAM, and are therefore only useful in a RAM expanded system. On a basic system, it would probably have made more sense to write software which uses less demanding resolutions with fewer bitplanes—partly because this would consume less of the confined RAM space, but also because more bitplanes would demand a higher video DMA bandwidth and consequently slow down the CPU as a result.

====DAT and Blitter====
The bitplanes on the C65 are organized in a less straightforward manner than e.g. on the Commodore Amiga, which organizes the bitplanes as straight rows of pixels: On the C65, the bytes within the bitplanes are organized as 25 rows of 40 or 80 stacks of 8 sequential bytes, similar to the original 320×200 VIC modes. Because this makes it harder to derive individual byte and pixel addresses from their position in the XY coordinate frame, the C65 provides a conversion mechanism in hardware called Display Address Translator (DAT).

Further aid to the programmer comes in the form of a bit-blitter, which supports

* Copy (up,down,invert), Fill, Swap, Mix (boolean Minterms) Hold, Modulus (window), Interrupt, and Resume modes
* Block operations from 1 byte to 64 KB

===DOS===
In contrast to previous 8-bit computers from Commodore, the C65 has a complete DOS through which the built-in 3.5-inch floppy disk drive can be controlled. Disks used by the C65 have a storage capacity of 880 KB and the drive is compatible with C1581. Since this format was uncommon for the former C64 owners, the C65 retains the serial IEC port for external Commodore disk drives. It&#x27;s possible to use a 1541, 1571, 1581, or other similar model.

The DOS itself is based on the Commodore PET IEEE 8250 drive DOS. Since it can only deal with two floppy disk drives, including the internal, only one external drive may be connected to the internal floppy disk controller. Like earlier systems, up to four drives can be daisy-chained on the IEC port.

===Interfaces===
The C65 includes the same ports of the C64. In addition, there is a DMA port for memory expansion. The latter is attached just like on the Amiga 500 via a flap in the bottom of the board. The built-in floppy disk drive is connected in parallel, serial Commodore drives can be connected via the usual IEC port. A plug for a genlock was also provided. Only the port for the C64 datasette is no longer available, and the user port missing—like the Aldi C64—the 9 volt AC line. The expansion port differs significantly from all prior C64 variants and rather resembles that of C16.

==Legacy==
Because the Commodore 65 was only a prototype, not many units were made. If one appears on eBay, it may sell for around $20,000.

===MEGA65===
In 2015, the Museum of Electronic Games &amp; Art (MEGA) announced a recreation of the Commodore 65. Also backwards compatible with the Commodore 64, the MEGA65 features Commodore 65 compatible hardware recreated in FPGA and supports newer connectors such as HDMI, MicroSD cards and LAN.

In September 2020, the pre-release developer-kit (r3) has sold out and in total 100 systems were delivered by the end of 2020.

On 30 September 2021, the final version of the MEGA65 with recreated C65 case, was available for pre-order. The first batch of 400 computers has sold out and been released to customers as of May 2022.

As of 10 May 2023, the second batch of 400 computers has also sold out and been released to customers.

The third batch followed a few months later and incorporates a few technical updates on the mainboard [reference to be added]. As of writing (October 2024), the MEGA65 is no longer delivered per batch, and is readily available.

<text>Robert James Dell’Oro Thomson (born 11 March 1961) is an Australian journalist. Since January 2013 he has been chief executive of News Corp.

== Life ==
Thomson was born in Torrumbarry, Victoria, and studied at Christian Brothers College in St Kilda East, and at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. One of his ancestors was named Arturo Dell&#x27;Oro, and came from Domodossola, in northern Italy. He is married to Wang Ping, the daughter of a general in the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

== Career ==
Thomson started work as a copyboy at &quot;The Herald&quot; (now the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;) in Melbourne in 1979. In 1983, he became senior feature writer for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, and two years later became Beijing correspondent for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; as well as the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. Thomson then became a Tokyo correspondent for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 1989. Thomson was appointed the &quot;Financial Times&quot; foreign news editor in 1994 and in 1996 became editor of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; weekend edition. While at &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Thomson wrote a series on Australian judges, which was published as a book in 1987, &quot;The Judges: A Portrait of an Australian Judiciary&quot;. In 1998, Thomson became U.S. managing editor of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

In May 2008, he was appointed managing editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, having previously been the editor of &quot;The Times&quot;.

He received an honorary doctorate from RMIT University in 2010.

In January 2013, Thomson became the chief executive of News Corp.

In 2007, Thomson was one of the first media executives to criticise Google and big tech for the disaggregation of content and publication of falsehoods, and to pressure them for a higher share of advertising value. He has been known to use alliterative expressions to call out those companies, such as platforms for &quot;the fake, the faux and the fallacious&quot;, and &quot;tech tapeworms.&quot; Thomson called for new terms of trade for tech platforms to allow viable business models for creators and to benefit broader society.

In 2023, Thomson has decried the unauthorised use of journalistic content by generative AI and the resulting existential risk posed to media companies. Thomson and several other media leaders have called for compensation by tech companies that are developing and employing AI. Speaking in May 2023 at INMA, a media conference, Thomson summed up the industry&#x27;s outrage, saying &quot;[media&#x27;s] collective IP is under threat and for which we should argue vociferously for compensation.&quot;  He said that AI was &quot;designed so the reader will never visit a journalism website, thus fatally undermining that journalism.&quot;

<doc id="653839" wikidata="Q2099753" url="?curid=653839" title="Loughborough Junction railway station">
<text>Loughborough Junction railway station is a railway station in the Loughborough Junction neighbourhood of the London Borough of Lambeth. It was opened as Loughborough Road by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1864. It is between Elephant &amp; Castle and Herne Hill stations and is served by Thameslink.

==History==

On 6 October 1862 the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) opened its City Branch from Herne Hill to Elephant and Castle. Services ran from Victoria to Elephant and Castle via a reversing move at Herne Hill. From 1 May 1863 services ran directly from Brixton to Camberwell via a curve at Loughborough Junction. Services were extended from Elephant and Castle to Blackfriars on 1 June 1894.

In October 1864 the LCDR opened Loughborough Road station on the north-to-west Brixton spur which connects the City Branch to the original Chatham Main Line at station. 

On 1 December 1872 platforms were opened on the City branch and on the north-to-east spur (called the Cambria Road platforms and spur after nearby Cambria Road). The enlarged station was renamed Loughborough Junction. 

The Loughborough Road platforms closed during the First World War on 3 April 1916 when the Victoria to Moorgate local service was withdrawn. This also led to the closure of Camberwell and Walworth Road stations to the north and the loss of direct service to Brixton, Clapham, Wandsworth Road, Battersea Park Road and Victoria.

In connection with the Southern Railway suburban electrification the platforms on Cambria Jn spur could not be lengthened so were closed on 12 July 1925.

After nationalisation the station was part of the Southern Region of British Railways and, from 1986, Network SouthEast. Around 1990 the station became part of the Thameslink route.

==Services==
Off-peak, all services at Loughborough Junction are operated by Thameslink using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:

* 4 tph to 
* 4 tph to (2 of these run via and 2 run via )

During the peak hours, a small number of Southeastern services between and London Blackfriars call at the station. The station is served by five trains to London Blackfriars in the morning peak and two trains to Beckenham Junction in the evening peak.

A small number of late evening Thameslink services are extended beyond St Albans City to . On Sundays, there are also direct services beyond St Albans City to .



==Connections==
London Buses routes 35, 45, 345, P4 and P5 and night route N35 serve the station.

==Future proposals==
The South London line passes across the south end of Loughborough Junction station via a bridge but has never had platforms there. As part of phase 2 of the East London line extension project, this line is now part of the London Overground network operated by Transport for London. Completed on 9 December 2012, this extension connected the South London Line to the East and West London lines, allowing rail services to run across South London from Surrey Quays to Clapham Junction. This creates an orbital network around Central London, fulfilling the Orbirail concept.

The new route passes over both Loughborough Junction and Brixton stations, and the proposals were criticised for not including new interchange stations at these locations. No London Overground platforms are planned at Loughborough Junction as the line is on high railway arches, making the cost of any station construction prohibitive. It has been proposed, as an alternative, that the disused East Brixton could be reopened instead as the site is close to both stations.

<doc id="653840" wikidata="Q4947835" url="?curid=653840" title="Boston College High School">
<text>Boston College High School (also known as BC High) is an all-male, Jesuit, Catholic college-preparatory day school in the Columbia Point neighborhood of Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts. It educates approximately 1,400 students in grades 7–12. Founded in 1863 as a constituent part of Boston College, the school separated from the college in 1927.

== History ==
=== Foundation and relationship with Boston College ===
In 1863, Jesuit priest John McElroy founded Boston College as a seven-year educational institution combining high school and college. The school administration believed that a seven-year course of study would ensure &quot;moral influence&quot; and a &quot;uniform and homogeneous course of teaching and of training.&quot; The high school and college shared a campus in Boston&#x27;s South End until 1910 (when the college moved to Chestnut Hill), and legally separated in 1927. Following the split, BC High initially remained in the South End, but moved to its current Dorchester campus in 1950.

During their years as a merged institution, BC High was much larger than the college. In 1913, it enrolled 1,300 students to the college&#x27;s 300. In 1922, BC High enrolled 1,500 boys, making it the nation&#x27;s largest Catholic high school and by far the nation&#x27;s largest Catholic boys&#x27; school (the next largest, in Philadelphia, educated 859). Students who graduated from BC High in good standing were automatically admitted to Boston College without examination. Today, only a minority of BC High students (102 out of 1445 graduates between 2017 and 2021) attend Boston College.

Although BC High and Boston College are now separate institutions, the two schools&#x27; athletic programs share the Eagle mascot, and graduates of BC High and BC are known as &quot;Double Eagles.&quot; (Graduates of BC High, BC, and BC&#x27;s graduate schools (traditionally the law school) are called &quot;Triple Eagles.&quot;)

Due to its shared history with Boston College, BC High has always been open to students of all faiths. The original Boston College was founded &quot;to educate Boston&#x27;s predominantly Irish, Catholic immigrant community.&quot; Nonetheless, the state government required the founders to open the school to students of all religious backgrounds, as reflected in Boston College&#x27;s founding charter.

=== 21st-century developments ===
In the 21st century, the size of BC High&#x27;s student body has fluctuated for various reasons. For most of the 2000s, the school educated approximately 1,300 students in the high school division. In 2006, BC High added a middle school (grades 7–8), dubbed the &quot;Arrupe Division,&quot; which temporarily increased the size of the school to 1,600 students. Since 2015, the student body has been shrinking. That year, the school surveyed its parents and alumni, who generally supported decreasing the size of the school over the alternatives of admitting female students or raising tuition to free up endowment funds for financial aid. In the 2022–23 school year, BC High enrolled 1,405 students, 334 of whom were in the middle school.

The school reportedly considered admitting girls in 2015 and 2017, but declined to do so after opposition from several stakeholders, including (allegedly) Cardinal O&#x27;Malley, the Archbishop of Boston, who was reportedly concerned about the effect a co-ed BC High might have on the Archdiocese&#x27;s all-girls schools. A former chairman of the BC High board of trustees echoed this concern. However, in 2017 BC High appointed its first female president, Grace Cotter Regan, who stated that she would respect the board and alumni&#x27;s wishes to continue single-sex education.

In 2023, BC High announced that it was launching a $125 million fundraising campaign to expand the scholarship fund and upgrade the campus. This campaign includes a $49 million gift (the largest in school history) to build a wellness complex, which will include a strength and conditioning center, a swimming pool, and exercise machines.

=== Sexual misconduct accusations ===
In 2002, Stephen F. Dawber was suspended from his teaching duties after accusations of sexual assault. This came just days after two other priests were accused of abuse about a decade prior.

In 2005, Jesuit priest James Talbot, who was also a teacher and coach at the school, pleaded guilty to rape, assault with intent to rape, and three counts of assault and battery, related to two students he sexually abused during his time there. The school had previously removed him after allegations of sexual assault surfaced from his time at Cheverus High School in Portland, Maine. Talbot&#x27;s actions were subsequently dramatized in the 2015 film &quot;Spotlight&quot;. In 2016, BC High trustee Jack Dunn successfully threatened to sue &quot;Spotlight&quot;&#x27;s filmmakers for defamation. The film&#x27;s distributor issued a statement clarifying that Dunn had not personally covered up sexual abuse at BC High.

== Academics ==
=== Global Education ===
The Hyde Center for Global Education was founded was established in 2012 with the gift of Lawrence Hyde, who was a member of the Class of 1942. The program offers a variety of international programs to 18 different countries.

=== Innovation ===
In 2020, alumnus Jack Shields donated $5 million to establish the Shields Innovation Center. The program aims to &quot;prioritize entrepreneurial thinking while preparing students for the rapidly evolving innovation economy&quot;.

== Financials ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
In the 2023–24 school year, BC High charged students $26,650, plus other mandatory and optional fees.

41% of the student body is on financial aid. Based on the school&#x27;s reported $11 million financial aid budget, the average aid grant is roughly $19,000 (~70% of tuition). In 2017, approximately 50% of the student body received financial aid, but the average aid grant was less than 50% of tuition.

=== Endowment and expenses ===
BC High does not file publicly accessible Internal Revenue Service disclosures. In the 2023 fiscal year, BC High reported that its financial endowment stood at $88.9 million.

== Facilities ==
St. Ignatius Hall (formerly McElroy Hall) is the Dorchester campus&#x27; original building. Shortly after, Cushing Hall opened in 1953, followed by the new Jesuit residence, Loyola Hall, in 1957. The Walsh Hall Science Center opened in 1965. Walsh Hall was renovated in 2007 for the opening of the Arrupe Division, which serves grades 7-8. McQuillan Hall and Cadigan Hall are the two newest buildings on the campus. McQuillan Hall houses the new science center and cafeteria.

Cadigan Hall opened in 2013 after alumnus Pat Cadigan donated $12 million for a new &quot;arts and recreation building&quot;. The hall features an atrium to facilitize alumni and outreach events. Cadigan Hall serves the art and music departments as well as the athletic program.

In the spring of 2016, Monan Park opened as the new home for the home for baseball at Boston College High School and the University of Massachusetts Boston. The complex features a baseball stadium with seating for 500 spectators and identical dimensions to Fenway Park, as well as a secondary field for baseball, lacrosse, and soccer. The joint project with the neighboring University of Massachusetts Boston was made possible with a $2 million donation from the Yawkey Foundation.

== Extracurricular activities ==

=== Athletics ===
Boston College High School teams are known as the Eagles, a name they share with Boston College. They compete as a member of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) Division 1 level, competing in the Catholic Conference (CC).

<text>A monograph is generally a work on one (usually scholarly) subject, or one aspect of a subject, created by a single author or artist. Traditionally it is in written form and published as a book, but it may be an artwork, audiovisual work, or exhibition made up of visual artworks. In library cataloguing, the word has a specific and broader meaning, while in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration uses the term to mean a set of published standards.

==Written works==
===Academic works===

The English term &quot;monograph&quot; is derived from modern Latin , which has its root in Greek. In the English word, &quot;mono-&quot; means and &quot;-graph&quot; means . 

Unlike a textbook, which surveys the state of knowledge in a field, the main purpose of a monograph is to present primary research and original scholarship. This research is presented at length, distinguishing a monograph from an article. For these reasons, publication of a monograph is commonly regarded as vital for career progression in many academic disciplines. Intended for other researchers and bought primarily by libraries, monographs are generally published as individual volumes in a short print run. In Britain and the U.S., what differentiates a scholarly monograph from an academic trade title varies by publisher, though generally it is the assumption that the readership has not only specialised or sophisticated knowledge but also professional interest in the subject of the work.

A written monograph is usually a specialist book on one topic, although its meaning has been broadened to include any works which are not reference works and which may be written by one or more authors, or an edited collection.

===Library definition===
In library cataloguing, &quot;monograph&quot; has a broader meaning: a non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a definite number of books. Thus it differs from a serial or periodical publication such as a magazine, academic journal, or newspaper. In this context only, books such as novels are considered monographs.

==Types of monographs==
=== Biology ===
In biological taxonomy, a monograph is a comprehensive treatment of a taxon in written form. Monographs typically review all known species within a group, add any newly discovered species, and collect and synthesize available information on the ecological associations, geographic distributions, and morphological variations within the group.

The first-ever monograph of a plant taxon was Robert Morison&#x27;s 1672 , a treatment of the Apiaceae.

=== Art ===
Book publishers use the term &quot;artist monograph&quot; or &quot;art monograph&quot; to indicate books dealing with a single artist, as opposed to broader surveys of art subjects.

===Film and multimedia===
The term monograph is also used for audiovisual or film documentary-type representations of a subject, often creatively expressed. The term &quot;monographic film&quot; has also been used for short fiction or animated films.

Video or film essays on a single topic are also referred to as monographs.

&quot;IndyVinyl&quot;, by Scottish film academic Ian Garwood, is a monographic research project focused on &quot;vinyl records in American independent cinema between 1987 and 2018&quot;. It includes an 8,000-word peer-reviewed academic book chapter; video compilations; &quot;critical montages&quot;; and a series of social media posts, all curated on a website. Garwood has written that his project is &quot;an attempt to produce a research output equivalent to an academic monograph, but incorporating video-based forms of criticism that have been popularised through online film culture&quot;.

== FDA usage ==
In the context of Food and Drug Administration regulation, monographs represent published standards by which the use of one or more substances is automatically authorized. For example, the following is an excerpt from the &quot;Federal Register&quot;: &quot;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule in the form of a final monograph establishing conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded as part of FDA&#x27;s ongoing review of OTC drug products.&quot; Such usage has given rise to the use of the word monograph as a verb, as in &quot;this substance has been monographed by the FDA&quot;.

<doc id="653851" wikidata="Q478631" url="?curid=653851" title="Tricolored bat">
<text>The tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) or American perimyotis is a species of microbat native to eastern North America. Formerly known as the eastern pipistrelle, based on the incorrect belief that it was closely related to European &quot;Pipistrellus&quot; species, the closest known relative of the tricolored bat is now recognized as the canyon bat. Its common name &quot;tricolored bat&quot; derives from the coloration of the hairs on its back, which have three distinct color bands. It is the smallest bat species in the eastern and midwestern US, with individuals weighing only . This species mates in the fall before hibernation, though due to sperm storage, females do not become pregnant until the spring. Young are born helpless, though rapidly develop, flying and foraging for themselves by four weeks old. It has a relatively long lifespan, and can live nearly fifteen years.

In the summer, females roost in small groups and males roost solitarily in tree foliage or beard lichen. It eats a diverse array of insects, foraging with a slow, erratic flight and navigating via echolocation. Though once considered one of the most common bat species in its range, its populations have declined rapidly since 2006 with the introduction of the fungal disease white-nose syndrome. It was listed as an endangered species in 2012 in Canada, and has been petitioned for inclusion on the US endangered species list. Along with the silver-haired bat, the tricolored bat is one of two bat species whose rabies variants have most frequently been implicated in human rabies deaths in the US, with sixteen deaths from 1958–2000.

==Taxonomy==

The tricolored bat was described as a new species in 1832 by French zoologist Frédéric Cuvier, who placed it in the genus &quot;Vespertilio&quot; with a scientific name of &quot;Vespertilio subflavus&quot;. The holotype had been collected in the US state of Georgia by American naturalist John Eatton Le Conte. In 1897, American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller Jr. placed it in the genus &quot;Pipistrellus&quot; for the first time as a result of its physical similarities to other members of the genus. Its common name was thus the &quot;eastern pipistrelle&quot;. In 1984 its status was reviewed, with H. Menu concluding that it was more similar in appearance to species in the genus &quot;Myotis&quot; rather than &quot;Pipistrellus&quot;, erecting a new genus for the taxon: &quot;Perimyotis&quot;. The name &quot;Perimyotis&quot; means &quot;around &quot;Myotis&quot;&quot;, alluding to its similarities with the genus. This classification was not immediately accepted, however, with a 1985 study instead grouping it and the canyon bat into the genus &quot;Parastrellus&quot; and a 1987 publication maintaining that the tricolored bat was part of the &quot;Pipistrellus&quot; genus, though they listed &quot;Perimyotis&quot; as one of seven subgenera. However, in 2003, a genetic study concluded that the tricolored bat was distinct from &quot;Pipistrellus&quot; species (and the canyon bat), confirming the validity of the genus &quot;Perimyotis&quot;. Usage of the scientific name &quot;Perimyotis subflavus&quot; is widely accepted as of 2019. Its common name was changed from &quot;eastern pipistrelle&quot; to &quot;tricolored bat&quot; to reflect its revised classification.

A 2010 study found that the sister taxon of the tricolored bat is the canyon bat, with the authors suggesting that these two genera form a tribe, though declining to name and formally describe the tribe. Instead, they referred to it as the &quot;perimyotine group&quot;, which they gave as the most basal member of a clade that also included the following tribes: Nycticeiini, Eptesicini, Vespertilioni, and another unnamed tribe referred to as the &quot;hysugine group&quot; (including &quot;Chalinolobus&quot;, &quot;Hypsugo&quot;, &quot;Laephotis&quot;, &quot;Neoromicia&quot;, &quot;Nycticeinops&quot;, &quot;Tylonycteris&quot;, and &quot;Vespadelus&quot;). The tribe was later described as Perimyotini.

Its species name &quot;subflavus&quot; means &quot;a little less than yellow&quot;, meaning yellowish or pale yellow. Four subspecies are recognized:
*&quot;P. s. clarus&quot; (Baker, 1954)
*&quot;P. s. floridanus&quot; (Davis, 1957)
*&quot;P. s. subflavus&quot; (Cuvier, 1832)
*&quot;P. s. veraecrucis&quot; (Ward, 1891)

==Description==
The tricolored bat has blond fur that is distinctly tricolored on its back. Individual hairs tricolored: dark gray at the base, buffy (yellowish brown) in the middle, and brown or reddish brown at the tip. It is the smallest bat species found in the eastern and midwestern US. Individuals have a forearm length of and weigh . Its forearms are reddish, contrasting sharply with the black membranes of its wings. Its wingspan is . It has a dental formula of for a total of 34 teeth.

==Biology and ecology==
===Reproduction and life cycle===
The tricolored bat is a seasonal breeder, with copulation (mating) occurring in the fall before hibernation. Ovulation does not occur until the spring, however, and females store the males&#x27; sperm in their uteruses through the winter. Gestation (pregnancy) length is about forty-four days, with females giving birth in June or July. The litter size is typically two individuals. As newborns, the combined mass of twin pups can be as great as 58% of the mother&#x27;s postpartum mass. At birth, the young lack fur and their eyes are closed. The mother leaves the offspring behind at the roost while she forages at night. Offspring develop rapidly, beginning to fly at three weeks old. By four weeks old, they are foraging for themselves. Young do not reach sexual maturity in their first fall; they do not breed until their second fall.

Individuals can live at least 14.8 years in the wild; juveniles have higher mortality rates than adults, and females have higher mortality rates than males.

===Behavior===
During the summer, the tricolored bat will roost in tree foliage or buildings, with females alone or in maternity colonies of up to thirty individuals. Trees used for this purpose include oak, maple, the eastern cottonwood, and American tulip tree. Males are solitary and do not form colonies. In Nova Scotia, researchers discovered nearly one hundred roosts of this species, finding that all sampled individuals were roosting not in tree foliage, but rather in a species of beard lichen, &quot;Usnea trichodea&quot;. This was thought to be the first documentation of a bat using beard lichen as a roosting substrate. It was speculated that the tricolored bat may use the lichen to ward off parasites. Usnic acid, which has anti-insect and anti-bacterial properties, naturally occurs in beard lichens, and no ectoparasites (external parasites) have been documented on the tricolored bat in Nova Scotia.

In the winter, the tricolored bat hibernates in mines, caves, or other human structures. A years-long study of a mine in the US state of Nebraska found that in the summer, the mine was mostly occupied by males. Total number of tricolored bats using the mine at one time ranged from zero to forty-three. Bats were in a state of torpor from November to April. More bats used the mine as a roost in the winter than in the summer. In another abandoned mine in the US state of Indiana, researchers found that the tricolored bat roosts solitarily during hibernation for the majority of the time (96.8% of observations were singletons). During hibernation, males lose an average of , while females lose an average of .

===Diet and foraging===
The tricolored bat is insectivorous, consuming small prey of in length. Prey taxa include mosquitoes, beetles, ants, moths, and cicadas. It forages with slow, erratic flight in areas near water or forest edges. It is one of the first bat species to begin foraging each night. It navigates and searches for prey via echolocation (sonar). Its echolocation calls are at a high frequency; visual renderings of the calls show a distinctive hook-shaped call profile, with the lowest frequencies (bottom of the hook shape) at 42 kHz.

===Predators, parasites, and disease===

The tricolored bat&#x27;s natural predators include the northern leopard frog, birds of prey, raccoons, snakes, skunks, and prairie voles. Feral cats will also catch and kill them as they leave their hibernacula (cave or mine used for hibernation). There are also records of it being attacked by the hoary bat. The tricolored bat is the host to several species of endoparasites (internal parasites) and ectoparasites. Oocysts (spores) of an &quot;Eimeria&quot; species (&quot;Eimeria heidti&quot; ) have been recovered from its guano (feces).

The tricolored bat has experienced severe population decline as a result of the fungal disease white-nose syndrome, which arrived in the US in 2006, with losses of 70% and greater detected in multiple US states. The disease kills bats by colonizing their skin during the winter, causing them to arouse from torpor and burn through their limited fat reserves. Though its population experienced dramatic reduction, subsequent studies have found that their numbers may be stabilizing, though hibernacula where many individuals once roosted may only host fewer than five bats, or even one solitarily.

==Range and habitat==
The tricolored bat is common throughout eastern North America, with the southern extent of its range in Central America and the northern extent in southern Canada. Its range has expanded since the 1980s, with westward expansion reaching the US states of Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Additionally, its range started to include the Great Lakes Basin.

==Conservation==
As of 2018, it is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. In 2008, however, it was considered a least-concern species, which is the IUCN&#x27;s lowest conservation priority. In the time between the two assessments, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome became widespread in eastern North America, severely impacting the tricolored bat. Historically, it was one of the most common bat species of eastern North America. After an emergency assessment, the tricolored bat is considered an endangered species under the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as of 2012. In 2016, the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife submitted a petition to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to list the tricolored bat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The USFWS determined that the petition demonstrated that listing the species as &quot;threatened&quot; or &quot;endangered&quot; may be warranted. In September 2022, the USFWS announced it would protect the bat as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, following a lawsuit from the Center for Biological Diversity.

==Relationship to people==

Along with the silver-haired bat, the tricolored bat is one of two species of bat whose rabies variants are responsible for 70% of human rabies cases from bats in the US. Additionally, the rabies virus variants associated with these two species caused 75% of cryptic rabies deaths in the US (rabies cases where the exposure route is unclear, and no bite history exists). From 1958–2000, sixteen people in the US died from the rabies variant associated with tricolored bats, or 46% of all nationwide indigenous (not acquired elsewhere) rabies fatalities. The tricolored bat is infrequently encountered by humans and submitted for rabies testing, with only thirty-one individuals tested for rabies in the US in 2017. Of those, one (3.4%) tested positive for the virus.

== Biography ==
Joel Goldsmith was born on November 19, 1957, in Los Angeles, California, the third of four children of Sharon (née Hennagin), a singer, and renowned composer Jerry Goldsmith. He was of Jewish descent. Goldsmith&#x27;s maternal uncle was composer and professor Michael Hennagin.

He was the main composer for the TV series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, although the main titles were written by David Arnold (who composed the score to &quot;Stargate&quot;, the film that began the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise). For &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, Goldsmith composed the main titles and the score. He also composed the main title theme and score for the second season of the CBS series &quot;Martial Law&quot;.

During his career, he usually collaborated with two composers; his father Jerry Goldsmith, and Neal Acree. He made his first move into video games music in 2006, scoring &quot;Call of Duty 3&quot;. During his final years, Goldsmith relocated to Hidden Hills, California, where he built a home studio in his back yard.

<text>Jonny Hurst (born 11 June 1966), originally from Solihull, Birmingham, latterly Wanstead, north London, is England&#x27;s first (and to date only) Chant Laureate.

Barclaycard set up the competition to choose a Chant Laureate, who would be paid £10,000 to tour Premiership stadiums and compose football chants for the 2004–5 football season. The judging panel was chaired by the Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, who said &quot;What we felt we were tapping into was a huge reservoir of folk poetry.&quot; Ironically, Hurst, a Birmingham City fan, composed the winning entry about Birmingham&#x27;s local rivals Aston Villa. The chant, sung to the tune of Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Copacabana&quot;, refers to that club&#x27;s star player, Juan Pablo Ángel. Some 1,500 people applied for the role.

A veteran of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Canal Cafe Theatre NewsRevue, Jonny Hurst is both a comedy writer and a lawyer.

He published his first book, &#x27;Becoming a Lawyer&#x27;, in July 2013.

<doc id="653868" wikidata="Q6374239" url="?curid=653868" title="Kashi (company)">
<text>Kashi is a maker of whole grain cereals and other plant-based foods sourced from regular farming practices. Founded in La Jolla in 1984, the company became a subsidiary of Kellogg&#x27;s in 2000, and produces about 100 products sold in the U.S. and Canada. Its original cereal, discontinued in 2021, was identified by the tagline &quot;Seven Whole Grains on a Mission&quot;. The name &quot;Kashi&quot; is a blended term derived from &quot;kashruth&quot;, meaning kosher or pure food, and &quot;Kushi&quot;, the last name of the founder of American macrobiotics, Michio Kushi.

== History ==
Kashi&#x27;s acquisition by Kellogg&#x27;s in 2000 allowed the parent company to enter the market for natural and organic foods.

In 2005 Kashi acquired Stretch Island Fruit Co, a producer of fruit strips and fruit chews. In 2008 Kashi acquired Bear Naked Granola, a producer of granola and bars. Both brands currently operate out of Kashi&#x27;s headquarters in Solana Beach, California.

In 2007, Kashi acquired Bear Naked food company.

In April 2012, Kashi announced it would remove GMOs from all its existing GOLEAN cereals and Kashi Chewy Granola Bars by the end of 2014. It later announced all its products would be Non-GMO Project Verified by the summer of 2016.

When the Kellogg Company was split into two companies in October 2023, Kashi became a unit of WK Kellogg Co.

===Location===
Kellogg&#x27;s moved Kashi&#x27;s operations to Battle Creek, Michigan, in 2013, to consolidate with its other cereal brands. But after sales declines in 2014, the parent company moved the business back to southern California in Solana Beach to help it realign with the health food community. At that time, Kashi was established as a stand-alone natural food business and would continue to encompass the Bear Naked and Stretch Island Fruit Co. brands. A team, headed by CEO David Denholm, who led Kashi in the 2000s, is now running the company as a standalone business. Kashi remains one of the largest natural foods businesses in the United States and the world.

== Controversies ==

In April 2012, a grocer in Rhode Island found out Kashi used genetically engineered, non-organic ingredients, and pulled Kashi products from his store&#x27;s shelves and later posted pictures and notification through social networking tools. Some customers began to call into question Kellogg&#x27;s use of the term &quot;natural&quot; on Kashi product labels. Kashi&#x27;s general manager responded by stating, &quot;The FDA has chosen not to regulate the term &#x27;natural&#x27;.&quot;

In 2012, the parent company of Kashi, the Kellogg Company, donated $790,000 to the NO on Prop. 37 campaign, which asked voters if they wanted foods containing genetically modified organisms to be labeled in California.

In 2013 it was reported that Kashi was being sued for claiming their products as &quot;all natural&quot; or &quot;nothing artificial&quot;. The Court certified the following two Classes:

1) California &quot;Nothing Artificial&quot; Class: All California residents who purchased Kashi Company&#x27;s food products on or after August 24, 2007 in the State of California that were labeled &quot;Nothing Artificial&quot; but which contained one or more of the following ingredients: &quot;Pyridoxine Hydrochloride&quot;, &quot;Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate&quot; and/or &quot;Hexane-Processed Soy&quot; ingredients. The Court excludes from the class anyone with a conflict of interest in this matter.

2) California &quot;All Natural&quot; Class: All California residents who purchased Kashi Company&#x27;s food products on or after August 24, 2007 in the State of California that were labeled &quot;All Natural&quot; but which contained one or more of the following ingredients: &quot;Pyridoxine Hydrochloride&quot;, &quot;Calcium Pantothenate&quot; and/or &quot;Hexane-Processed Soy ingredients&quot;.

<doc id="653873" wikidata="Q5179820" url="?curid=653873" title="Cowrie-shell divination">
<text>Cowrie-shell divination refers to several distinct forms of divination using cowrie shells that are part of the rituals and religious beliefs of certain religions. Though best-documented in West Africa as well as in Afro-American religions, such as Regla de Ocha, Candomblé, and Umbanda, cowrie-shell divination has also been recorded in India, East Africa, and other regions.

==In West Africa==
Several forms of cowrie-shell divination are distributed broadly throughout West Africa.

While there are many variants using from eight to 21 cowrie shells, West African-derived forms most commonly use 16 cowrie shells on a prepared table or on a mat on the ground, interpreting the patterns that result which are known as Odu. Before casting the shells, the priest/priestess invokes and salutes the Orishas, and puts questions to them. The Orishas answer the questions by influencing the way the shells fall on the table.

===Ẹẹ́rìndínlógún===
Ẹẹ́rìndínlógún (from the Yoruba &quot;owó mẹ́rìndínlógún&quot; &quot;sixteen cowries&quot;, literally &quot;four taken from 20&quot;) is a cowrie-shell divination method practiced in the Yoruba religion.

The number 16 holds important significance in Yoruba mythology as it was the purported number of original divinities that established life on earth. In merindinlogun divination, the shells are thrown and the number of shells that fall with the opening facing up is associated with a certain odu. This system of divination is used when consulting the Orishas.

==In the African diaspora==
Cowrie-shell divination is found in Latin America where it plays an important role in religions like Santería and Candomblé.

In Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, it is called .

In Brazil, it is called or .

Though they share a common root, Caribbean and South American cowrie shell divination have subsequently developed in independence from West African practice. For example, among Caribbean diviners, the first throw of the shells involves throwing them twice to derive a composite &quot;Odu.&quot; While there are regional practices in Yorubaland where this is also the case, it is not as standardized and uniform as it is in Cuba, suggesting a weaker quality control by Cuban Ifá priests.

===In Santería===
The cowrie-shells, called Diloggún, are used by priests and priestesses of Santería, who are called Santeros and Santeras, respectively. Both men and women who have been initiated into Santería can read cowrie shells. There are a combination of 256 possible odu and a skilled diviner can interpret the meaning of each one, depending on the orientation of the reading. If the reading comes in Ire, the client will experience good fortune, and if it comes in Osogbo, the client faces obstacles that can be overcome with the help of the Orichás.

===In Candomblé===

The cowrie shell, as collected from a beach, has a flattened side with a longitudinal slit, and a smooth, rounded side. Like a coin, the shell has only two stable positions on a flat surface, with the slit side facing either up or down. A few cowrie-shell diviners use the shells in this natural state; then the outcome of the throw, for each piece, is either &quot;open&quot; (slit up) or &quot;closed&quot; (slit down). Some modern day witches also use cowrie shell divination.

Most priests, however, use modified shells whose rounded part has been ground away, creating a second, artificial opening. The two stable positions of the shell are still called &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; for divination purposes. In most Candomblé houses, &quot;open&quot; still means that the natural opening is facing up; but some traditions (mainly in Candomblé Ketu) use the opposite convention.
The number of &quot;open&quot; shells is used to select an item (&quot;odú&quot;) which direct the diviner to a fixed list of oracular verses.

<text>The oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), also known as the oyster toad, ugly toad, oyster cracker, oyster catcher, and bar dog, is a Northwest Atlantic species of fish of the family Batrachoididae. The maximum length of this toadfish is , but they infrequently surpass . The world record size for this species is 19.2 inches which is 48.76 cm. They are generally yellowish with a pattern of brown oblique bars. The species can live in poor conditions and needs little food to live. They can be found near the shore from Maine to Florida.

In 1998, NASA sent the oyster toadfish into space to investigate the effects of microgravity on the development of otolithic organs. The study found little difference between terrestrial development and those in space.

==Life history==

===Spawning and life cycle ===

Oyster toadfish spawn in coastal estuaries from May through August, with some variation between latitudes. Males excavate nests under rocks or other debris and begin making advertisement calls, also known as boatwhistles and foghorns. Females are attracted to these calls. Females choose a mate, enter the nest, attach eggs to the underside of the structure, then leave. Females provide no parental care. Males fertilize the eggs, then defend and clean the nest while embryos develop. Toadfish embryos are large and, as a result, have been studied for over a century.

After about 4 weeks the eggs hatch. At first, the young toadfish stay attached to the yolk. When the yolk has been absorbed for energy, the young toadfish learn to swim. Even when the young have started to swim, the adult still protects its young.

Juveniles reach sexual maturity at 2-7 years and have a lifespan of 8 years. Little is known about individual range or whether toadfish exhibit natal philopatry.

===Predators and prey===

Toadfish are ambush predators during the day, when they remain buried or hidden under structure and lunge for passing prey. At night they forage. Toadfish eat benthic invertebrates (e.g. polychaetes) and xanthid crabs. Toadfish have sharp teeth and powerful jaws.

Oyster toadfish are apex predators on oyster reefs. Nonetheless, evidence exists that they are prey for birds (e.g. cormorants). A related species, &quot;Opsanus beta&quot;, is prey for dolphins. Research has demonstrated that toadfish will call less when dolphin sounds are played from a nearby speaker. For protection, toadfish have a venomous spine in the first ray of the dorsal fin. They can bury themselves up to their eyeballs in sand, and might be capable of camouflage.

==Physiology==

Like many bony fish oyster toadfish have a swim bladder that is used to maintain buoyancy. Like some vocalizing fish, the swim bladder is also used to make sounds. Oyster toadfish males use their swimbladders to make advertisement calls. The fast-twitch swimbladder muscles of toadfish can contract as much as 300 times per second, more quickly than fast-twitch muscles in most vertebrates.

==Model for hearing and behavior==

Toadfish are easy to observe and collect because they spawn in shallow water. Also, male advertisement calls are easy to detect and are critical for the animal&#x27;s reproductive success. For these reasons, toadfish have been widely studied in research that examines mating behavior, hearing sensitivity and the impacts of anthropogenic noise.

== Cuisine ==
Oyster toadfish are hard to fillet due to their bony bodies. The meat of the oyster toadfish is flaky and is described as having a sweet flavor, similar to that of blowfish.

<doc id="653886" wikidata="Q10513978" url="?curid=653886" title="Petrocurrency">
<text>Petrocurrency (or petrodollar) is a word used with three distinct meanings, often confused:

#Dollars paid to oil-producing nations (petrodollar recycling)—a term invented in the 1970s meaning trading surpluses of oil-producing nations.
#Currencies of oil-producing nations which tend to rise in value against other currencies when the price of oil rises (and fall when it falls).
#Pricing of oil in US dollars: currencies used as a unit of account to price oil in the international market.

==Oil-producers&#x27; trading surpluses==

&quot;Petrocurrency&quot; or (more commonly) &quot;petrodollars&quot; are popular shorthand for revenues from petroleum exports, mainly from the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway. Especially during periods of historically expensive oil, the associated financial flows can reach a scale of hundreds of billions of US dollar-equivalents per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not.

==Currencies correlated with oil prices==
The pound sterling has sometimes been regarded as a petrocurrency as a result of North Sea oil exports.

The Dutch guilder was once regarded as a petrocurrency due to its large quantities of natural gas and North Sea oil exports. The guilder strengthened greatly in the 1970s, after OPEC began a series of price hikes throughout the decade that consequently increased the value of all oil-producing nations&#x27; currencies. However, as a result of the appreciation of the Guilder, industrial manufacturing and services in the Netherlands during the 1970s and into the 1980s were crowded out of the larger national economy, and the country became increasingly non-competitive on world markets due to the high cost of Dutch industrial and service exports. This phenomenon is often referred to in economics literature as Dutch disease.

The Canadian dollar is sometimes viewed as a petrocurrency, but this status is controversial. In theory, as the price of oil rises, oil-related export revenues rise for an oil exporting nation, and thus constitute a larger monetary component of exports. As their oil sands deposits have been increasingly exploited and sold on the international market, movements of the Canadian dollar have sometimes been correlated with the price of oil. In 2015, University of British Columbia Professor Werner Antweiler predicted that if the share of oil and gas exports increases further, the link between oil prices and the exchange rate may become even stronger. However, in recent years, the opposite trend has become apparent, with the Bank of Canada and major Canadian financial institutions reporting that there is a disconnect between oil demand and the Canadian dollar&#x27;s movement (having been virtually static within foreign exchange markets throughout the 2021–2022 global energy crisis). There is no conclusive explanation for this disparity, but speculated reasons include weak investor interest in Canadian oilsands (due to the growing rise of ESG investment), the increasing size of the US petroleum industry and the relative reputation of the US Dollar.

==Currencies used to trade oil==
As the world&#x27;s dominant reserve currency, the United States dollar has been a major currency for trading oil. In August 2018, Venezuela joined the group of countries that allow their oil to be purchased in currencies other than US dollars, thus allowing purchases in Euros, Yuan (Petroyuan) and other directly convertible currencies. Other nations that permit this include Iran. (sometimes the term &quot;petrodollar&quot; is mistakenly used to refer to this concept).

===World War II to 1970===
After WWII, international oil prices were for some time based on discounts or premiums relative to that for oil in the Gulf of Mexico.

After the Bretton Woods conference in the year 1944, the UK and its allies discontinued linking their currencies with gold; however, the US dollar continued to be pegged to gold, at $35 per ounce—from 1941 to 1971.

===1970 to 2000===
President Nixon cancelled the fixed-rate convertibility of US dollars to gold in 1971. In the absence of fixed value convertibility to gold, compared to other currencies, the US dollar subsequently deteriorated in value for several years, making fixed USD to local currency exchange rates unsustainable for most countries.

Since the agreements of 1971 and 1973, OPEC oil is generally quoted in US dollars, sometimes referred to as petrodollars.

In October 1973, OPEC declared an oil embargo in response to the United States&#x27; and Western Europe&#x27;s support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War.

===Iran===

Since the beginning of 2003, Iran has required payment in euros for exports to Asia and Europe. The government opened an Iranian Oil Bourse on the free trade zone on the island of Kish, for the express purpose of trading oil priced in other currencies, including euros.

===OPEC and shale oil boom===
The unconventional tight oil (shale oil) boom in the USA starting in the early 2000s through 2010s (as well as increased production capacity in many other countries) greatly limited OPEC&#x27;s ability to control oil prices. Consequently, due to a drastic fall in Nymex crude oil price to as low as $35.35 per barrel in 2015, many oil-exporting countries have had severe problems in balancing their budget.

By 2016, many oil exporting countries had been adversely affected by low oil prices including Russia, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Venezuela and Nigeria.

===Venezuela===
The petro, or &quot;petromoneda&quot;, launched in February 2018, is a cryptocurrency developed by the government of Venezuela. Announced in December 2017, it is claimed to be backed by the country&#x27;s oil and mineral reserves, and it is intended to supplement Venezuela&#x27;s plummeting bolívar fuerte currency, purportedly as a means of circumventing U.S. sanctions and accessing international financing.

===China===

In March 2018, China opened a futures market denominated in Yuan which could encourage the use of its currency as a petrocurrency.

<text>Joseph Juneau (; May 28, 1836–March 1, 1899) was a French Canadian miner and prospector known for co-founding, with Richard Harris, the city of Juneau, Alaska, United States. The city has been the political capital of Alaska since 1900.

== Biography ==
Joseph Juneau was born in the Lower Canada town of Saint-Paul-l&#x27;Ermite (later renamed Le Gardeur and now incorporated into the city of Repentigny) to François Xavier Juneau dit Latulippe and Marguerite Thiffault Juneau. 

Juneau&#x27;s Native American guide in southeastern Alaska was Chief Kowee, who is credited with exploring much of the area later named for Juneau. Harris and Juneau were sent with Kowee by George Pilz, an entrepreneur and mining engineer from Sitka. After trading much of their for hoochinoo, or homebrew, they returned to Pilz empty-handed but were promptly sent back to the Juneau area. There, Kowee took them beyond Gold Creek (near what is now the site of the city&#x27;s Federal Building) to Silver Bow Basin. Today, a creek on Douglas Island is named Kowee Creek. After the discovery of gold in the area, Harris and Juneau carried approximately 1,000 pounds of gold ore back to Sitka.

The settlement founded by Juneau and Harris was originally called Harrisburg or Harrisburgh, and later Rockwell. Miners often used both names in their records. There was also a proposal to name the town Pilzburg in honor of Pilz. The town received its current name at a miners&#x27; meeting on December 14, 1881, at which the name Juneau received 47 of the 72 votes cast, while Harrisburg received 21 votes and Rockwell only four. Joe Juneau reportedly bought drinks for fellow miners to persuade them to name the city in his honor.

Juneau traveled to Dawson City, Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush of the 1890s. He usually spent his gold as fast as he mined it, but at the end of his life he owned a small restaurant in Dawson. Juneau died of pneumonia in March 1899 in Dawson. His body was brought back to the town that bears his name and was buried in the city&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery on August 16, 1903. His cousin Solomon Juneau founded the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

<text>Farina, formerly Farina Town and originally Government Gums, is an abandoned town in the Australian state of South Australia. The name also applies to an area of about in which the town is located. At the 2006 census, 55 people lived in the larger area; by the 2021 census, the population had fallen to 15.

Farina sits within the arid Lake Eyre basin, north of Lyndhurst and south of Marree where the Oodnadatta Track and the Birdsville Track commence. It is due north of the state capital; Adelaide in the days when the rail connection was narrow gauge to Port Augusta, the distance by rail was .

A drone view of Farina is here.

==History==

In 1876, after a police trooper had been posted to the Government Gums, a &quot;long neglected district&quot;, a deputation asked for a portion of the district to be allotted as a township so that a post office might be erected; that a telegraph station be opened; and that a weekly mail service from Beltana to the north-west be set up. The townsite, on a reserve surrounding &quot;Gums Waterhole&quot;, was surveyed and on 21 March 1878, Farina Town was proclaimed.

Originally called The Gums or Government Gums, Farina was settled in 1878 by optimistic farmers hoping that &quot;rain follows the plough&quot;. The town became a railhead in 1882, but the railway was extended to Marree in 1884. During the wet years of the 1880s, plans were laid out for a town with 432 quarter-acre (0.10 hectares) blocks. It was believed that the area would be good for growing wheat and barley, but normal rainfall proved to be nowhere near enough for that. Several silver and copper mines were opened in the surrounding area.

Farina grew to reach a peak population of about 600 in the late 19th century. In its heyday, the town had two hotels (the Transcontinental and the Exchange), an underground bakery, a bank, two breweries, a general store, an Anglican church, five blacksmiths, a school (1879–1957) and a brothel. In 1909, a iron meteorite was discovered north-east of the town.

Today, little remains of the township, except for stone ruins, a seasonally operating underground bakery, and the elevated water tank of the former railway. The post office closed in the 1960s. The narrow-gauge Central Australia Railway closed in 1958.

The name Farina was adopted on 5 April 1979.

The town has not been inhabited since 1967, with the closest residents living at Farina station, visible to the west of the town. A bush camping area is maintained by the owners of Farina station.

In 2008, Farina Restoration Group was formed, and in May of that year, 30 people attended a 14-day restoration program at Farina. These efforts have included the repair of the bakery and the addition of informational signs.

===Cemeteries===

The town&#x27;s cemetery is a few kilometres away via a signposted track. Of interest is the Afghan corner of the cemetery, which contains several headstones with both English and Arabic inscriptions, plus several headstones without inscriptions, marking the resting place of former Farina residents of Afghan origin, who were involved in or connected with the camel trains which used to provide transport services before the railway was extended. In the Islamic tradition, all the gravestones face Mecca

=== First World War enlistments ===

During the First World War, 33 men who were born in Farina enlisted for the duration of the war and for four months after its end. All of them were volunteers. Of the total, five were killed in action, ten were wounded, and one died at sea en route to England. One of the youngest Farina residents to enlist was 15-year-old William James Denham Robinson, who used an alias of Charles Robison; he served in both world wars.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, 35 men born in Farina enlisted. Of those, nine served in the Royal Australian Air Force. The first man enlisted on 18 October 1939 and the last man on 15 March 1945. The youngest was 18 when he enlisted and the oldest was 45. Three men were killed in action and a fourth died during his service in the army. The last Farina man was discharged in October 1948.

==Climate==
Farina has a hot desert climate, although a temperature station has not been in operation there since 1939.

<doc id="653913" wikidata="Q603742" url="?curid=653913" title="Double standard">
<text>A double standard is the application of different sets of principles for situations that are, in principle, the same. It is often used to describe treatment whereby one group is given more latitude than another. A double standard arises when two or more people, groups, organizations, circumstances, or events are treated differently even though they should be treated the same way. A double standard &quot;implies that two things which are the same are measured by different standards&quot;.

Applying different principles to similar situations may or may not indicate a double standard. To distinguish between the application of a double standard and a valid application of different standards toward circumstances that only &quot;appear&quot; to be the same, several factors must be examined. One is the sameness of those circumstances – what are the parallels between those circumstances, and in what ways do they differ? Another is the philosophy or belief system informing which principles should be applied to those circumstances. Different standards can be applied to situations that appear similar based on a qualifying truth or fact that, upon closer examination, renders those situations distinct (a physical reality or moral obligation, for example). However, if similar-looking situations have been treated according to different principles and there is no truth, fact or principle that distinguishes those situations, then a double standard has been applied.

If correctly identified, a double standard usually indicates the presence of hypocrisy, bias or unjust behaviors.

==Causes and explanations==
Double standards are believed to develop in people&#x27;s minds for a multitude of possible reasons, including: finding an excuse for oneself, emotions clouding judgement, twisting facts to support beliefs (such as confirmation biases, cognitive biases, attraction biases, prejudices or the desire to be right). Human beings have a tendency to evaluate people&#x27;s actions based on who did them.

In a study conducted in 2000, Dr. Martha Foschi observed the application of double standards in group competency tests. She concluded that status characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic class, can provide a basis for the formation of double standards in which stricter standards are applied to people who are perceived to be of lower status. Dr. Foschi also noted the ways in which double standards can form based on other socially valued attributes such as beauty, morality, and mental health.

Dr. Tristan Botelho and Dr. Mabel Abraham, Assistant Professors at the Yale School of Management and Columbia Business School, studied the effect that gender has on the way people rank others in financial markets. Their research showed that average-quality men were given the benefit of the doubt more than average-quality women, who were more often &quot;penalized&quot; in people&#x27;s judgments. Botelho and Abraham also showed that women and men are similarly risk-loving, contrary to popular belief. Altogether, their research showed that double standards (at least in financial markets) do exist around gender. They encourage the adoption of controls to eliminate gender bias in application, hiring, and evaluation processes within organizations. Examples of such controls include using only initials on applications so that applicants&#x27; genders are not apparent, or auditioning musicians from behind a screen so that their skills, and not their gender, influence their acceptance or rejection into orchestras. Practices like these are, according to Botelho and Abraham, already being implemented in a number of organizations.

==Common areas==
===Gender===
It has long been debated how someone&#x27;s gender role affects others&#x27; moral, social, political and legal responses. Some believe that differences in the way men and women are perceived and treated is a function of social norms, thus indicating a double standard. For example, one claim is that a double standard exists in society&#x27;s judgment of women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s sexual conduct. Research has found that casual sexual activity is regarded as more acceptable for men than for women. According to William G Axinn, double standards between men and women can potentially exist with regards to: dating, cohabitation, virginity, marriage/remarriage, sexual abuse/assault/harassment, domestic violence and singleness.

Kennair et al. (2023) found no signs on a sexual double standard in long or short-term mating contexts, nor in choosing a friend. They did find however that women&#x27;s self-stimulation was judged positively, and men&#x27;s self-stimulation was judged negatively. A 2017 study of American college students also found no evidence of a gendered double standard around promiscuity.

===Law===
A double standard may arise if two or more groups who have equal legal rights are given different degrees of legal protection or representation. Such double standards are seen as unjustified because they violate a common maxim of modern legal jurisprudence - that all parties should stand equal before the law. Where judges are expected to be impartial, they must apply the same standards to all people, regardless of their own subjective biases or favoritism, based on: social class, rank, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age or other distinctions.

===Politics===
A double standard arises in politics when the treatment of the same political matters between two or more parties (such as the response to a public crisis or the allocation of funding) is handled differently. 

Double standard policies can include situations when a country&#x27;s or commentator&#x27;s assessment of the same phenomenon, process or event in international relations depends on their relationship with or attitude to the parties involved. In &quot;Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; (1975), Gerald Seymour wrote: &quot;One man&#x27;s terrorist is another man&#x27;s freedom fighter&quot;.

=== Ethnicity ===
Double standards exist when people are preferred or rejected on the basis of their ethnicity in situations in which ethnicity is not a relevant or justifiable factor for discrimination (as might be the case for a cultural performance or ethnic ceremony).

The intentional efforts of some people to counteract racism and ethnic double standards can sometimes be interpreted by others as actually perpetuating racism and double standards among ethnic groups. Writing for &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, Rod Dreher quotes the account published in &quot;Quillette&quot; by Coleman Hughes, a black student at Columbia University, who said he was given an opportunity to play in a backup band for Grammy Award-winning pop artist Rihanna at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards Show. According to Hughes, several of his friends were also invited; however, one of them was fired and replaced because, according to Hughes, his white Hispanic background did not suit the all-black aesthetic that Rihanna&#x27;s team had chosen for her show. The team had decided that all performers on stage were to be black, aside from Rihanna&#x27;s regular guitar player. Hughes was uncertain about whether he believed this action was unethical, given that the show was racially themed to begin with. He observed what he believed to be a double standard in the entertainment industry, saying, &quot;if a black musician had been fired in order to achieve an all-white aesthetic — it would have made front page headlines. It would have been seen as an unambiguous moral infraction.&quot; 
Dreher argues that Hughes&#x27;s observations highlight the difficulty in distinguishing between the exclusion of one ethnic group in order to celebrate another, and the exclusion of an ethnic group as the exercise of racism or a double standard. Dreher also discussed another incident, in which &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Bari Weiss, who is Jewish, was heavily criticized for tweeting, &quot;Immigrants: They get the job done&quot;, in a positive reference to Mirai Nagasu, a Japanese-American Olympic ice skater, who Weiss was trying to honor. The public debate about ethnicity and double standards remains controversial and, by all appearances, will continue.

<text>Coggeshall ( or ) is a town and civil parish in the Braintree district, in Essex, England, between Braintree and Colchester on the Roman road Stane Street and the River Blackwater. In 2001 it had a population of 3,919. It has almost 300 listed buildings and a market whose charter was granted in 1256 by King Henry III.

==Etymology==
There has been a long history of debate about the meaning of the name Coggeshall. Different pronunciations and spellings have been used throughout its history and many theories as to the name&#x27;s origin have arisen. The name appears as &quot;Kockeshale&quot; around the year 1060. while the first element may be an Old English personal name (&quot;Cocc&quot; or &quot;Cogg&quot;). Margaret Gelling associated the name Coggeshall with the landscape in which it is situated, believing that &quot;-hall&quot; comes from Anglo-Saxon &quot;healh&quot;, meaning a nook or hollow, thus rendering the name as &quot;Cogg&#x27;s nook&quot; (with Cogg as a proper name), corresponding to Coggeshall&#x27;s sunken position in the 150-foot contour line. 

The Domesday Book from 1086 addresses the village as &quot;Cogheshala&quot; and it is mentioned elsewhere as &quot;Cogshall, Coxal, Coggashæl&quot;&quot; and &quot;Gogshall&quot;. Coggeshall has also been called &quot;Sunnydon&quot;, referenced in 1224 as an alias for the village.

Beaumont brought together several theories for the name in his 1890 book &quot;A History of Coggeshall, in Essex&quot;.
# Weever 1631 wrote about a monument found on &quot;Coccillway&quot;, thought that Coccill was a Lord of the area in Roman days and a corruption of the name led to Coggeshall.
# the largely discredited antiquarian Alfred John Dunkin thought that it was a concatenation of two Celtic words – Cor or Cau with Gafæl, enclosure hold; or Cœd and Cær or Gær, camp in a wood, &quot;Cogger&quot;, the person owning this camp may have had a hall, therefore Coggershall.
# Philip Morant opined that the name was a corruption of Cocks-hall, with the seal of the Abbey featuring three cockerels. This may also be supported by Beaumont&#x27;s suggestion that the first parish church, like the current one, was dedicated to Saint Peter, and the cockerel was used as a sign of this dedication.
# Beaumont also reasons that the name may have come from the red-coloured shrub the Coccus, whose colour is pronounced Coch; many Ancient Britons had names related to colours.

==History==
Coggeshall dates back at least to an early Saxon settlement, though the area has been settled since the Mesolithic period. There is evidence of a Roman villa or settlement (Noviomagus Icenorum) before then and the town lies on Stane Street, which may have been built on a much earlier track. The drainage aqueducts of Stane Street are still visible in the cellar of the Chapel Inn today. Roman coins dating from 31 BC to AD 395 have been found in the area and Coggeshall has been considered the site of a Roman station mentioned in the &quot;Itineraries&quot; of &quot;Antoninus&quot;. Coggeshall is situated at a ford of the River Blackwater, part of another path running from the Blackwater Valley to the Colne Valley. Where these paths crossed a settlement started.

Coggeshall is mentioned as &quot;Cogheshala&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the ancient hundred of Witham, when it had &quot;a mill; about 60 men with ploughs and horses, oxen and sheep; woodland with swine and a swineherd, four stocks of bees and one priest&quot;. William the Conqueror gave the manor of Coggeshall to Eustace, the Count of Boulogne.

The modern history of Coggeshall begins around 1140 when King Stephen and his queen Matilda, founded Coggeshall Abbey, a large Savigniac abbey with 12 monks from Savigny in France, the last to be established before the order was absorbed by the Cistercians in 1147. Matilda visited the Abbey for the last time in 1151 and asked for the Abbot&#x27;s blessing, &quot;If thou should never see my face again, pray for my Soul. More things are wrought by prayer than this World dreams of.&quot;

Flint and rubble were the main materials used in the construction of the monastery, and the buildings were faced with stone punted up the Blackwater, and locally produced brick. Brick making had died out in Britain since the Romans left and the monks may have been instrumental in its re-establishment around this time. They built a kiln in the north of the town at a place called Tile Kiln, an area now known as Tilkey. The bricks from Coggeshall are some of the earliest-known bricks in post-Roman Britain. Long Bridge, in the south of the village, was probably built in the 13th century using these bricks and the kiln in Tilkey continued to produce bricks until 1845. The Church was sufficiently complete to be dedicated by the Bishop of London in 1167.

The estate commanded by the monastery was extensive. The monks farmed sheep, and their skilled husbandry developed a high-quality wool that formed the foundation of the village&#x27;s prosperous cloth trade during the 15th to mid-18th centuries, when it was particularly renowned for its fine Coggeshall White cloth. The monastery also had fishponds with strict fishing rights – a vicar of Coggeshall was imprisoned in Colchester for stealing fish. However, the monastery could not produce all that it required and sold produce at an annual fair to buy the things they did not have. In 1250 the Abbot of Coggeshall was allowed by Royal Charter to hold an eight-day fair commencing on 31 July – the feast of St. Peter-ad-Vincula, to whom the Parish Church was dedicated. In 1256, a Saturday market was granted as long as it didn&#x27;t interfere with its neighbours. Colchester complained in 1318 that Coggeshall was a hindrance, and their complaint, being upheld, resulted in the market being moved to Thursday, where it remains to this day.

The Black Death hit the Abbey hard, with the number of monks and conversi much reduced. Revenues across Essex fell to between one third to one half of pre-plague rates; the abbey suffered financially with tenanted and cultivated lands heavily decreased. During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381 the Abbey was broken into and pillaged. The sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire, John Sewall, was targeted by rioters at his Coggeshall house, now the Chapel Inn. By the early 15th century a new church was begun at the Abbey called St. Mary&#x27;s; it was completed by the start of the 16th century but the Dissolution of the Monasteries brought an end to the prosperity of monks. In 1530 Abbot Love was demoted with a list of complaints raised against him; though some of them may have been fabricated, it appears that standards at the monastery were dropping. It was common practice at the time that Abbots unsympathetic to the will of the King were replaced with more favourable ones; in this case Abbot More was supplanted by Dr. T. Leigh. Coggeshall survived the Act of Suppression in 1536 and the Abbot of St. Mary Grace&#x27;s, London, invested in its future. However, the political situation was opposed to the monasteries and Coggeshall succumbed in 1538, handed over by Abbot More. The monks were sent back to their families or into the community, many becoming priests. Abbot Love became vicar of Witham where he stayed until his death in 1559. The monastery&#x27;s possessions and lands, totalling nearly 50,000 acres (200 km2), were seized; King Henry VIII granted them to Sir Thomas Seymour. They remained in his possession until 1541 when they were split up.

In the 1086 Domesday Survey, Great and Little Coggeshall is listed in the hundred of Witham, not in the hundred of Lexden. The separate parishes of Great Coggeshall and Little Coggeshall were established thereafter. Well before the start of the 19th century, Great Coggeshall parish was within the hundred of Lexden, while Little Coggeshall remained within the hundred of Witham. Great and Little Coggeshall were reunited when the civil parish of Coggeshall was formed on 1 April 1949 from Great Coggeshall, Feering, Little Coggeshall, Markshall and Pattiswick parishes.

===Economy and industry===
After the decline of the wool trade, Coggeshall&#x27;s economy centred around cloth, silk and velvet, with over half of the population employed in its production. The cloth trade is first linked with the town in 1557 as a well-established industry but the onslaught of various trade laws brought about the decline of the trade. The last book order entry for cloth production is listed as 14 November 1800.

The 1851 census showed Coggeshall to be one of the most industrialised places in Essex. However, the English silk industry was being artificially supported by a ban on imported silk goods; Continental silk was cheaper and of a higher quality. When Parliament repealed the ban in 1826 and later reduced and finally removed duties on French silk, English weavers were unable to compete and Coggeshall&#x27;s economy was devastated.

The town again found fame in Tambour lace, a form of lace-making introduced to Coggeshall around 1812 by a Monsieur Drago and his daughters. The production of this lace continued through the 19th century before dying out after the Second World War. Examples of Coggeshall lace have been worn by Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth II.

Coggeshall was noted for the quality of its brewing, in the late 19th century having four well-established institutions. In 1888 Gardner and Son were awarded the Diploma of Honour at the National Brewer&#x27;s Exhibition. The brewery buildings have undergone alternative use in recent years, with several now used a residential buildings and another used as the Coggeshall Village Hall. In 2008 the Red Fox Brewery was opened near Coggeshall.

By the end of the 19th century gelatine and isinglass production was well established at a site on West Street, production continued until ceasing in the late 1980s.

In the mid-19th century John Kemp King established seed growing in the area where it continues to this day. The seed growing industry is said to have originally started with the Cistercian monks at the abbey.

===Nonconformist chapels===
The first independent place of worship in Coggeshall was a converted barn on East Street, put to use in 1672. In 1710 a permanent chapel was built on Stoneham Street for &quot;Protestant Dissenters from the Church of England, commonly called Independents&quot;. By 1716 there were 700 hearers including some of the wealthiest and most influential people from the local area. In 1834 the chapel was enlarged and again in 1865. Today the building continues to be part of the United Reformed Church in continuous succession from its Congregational and Independent past. The modern Christ Church which meets in the building is now a Local Ecumenical Partnership (LEP); a new single congregation coming together from a union of the three chapels in 1989 and uniting members from the Baptist Union, the Methodist Church, and the United Reformed Church.

The Quakers were active in Coggeshall as early as 1655, with Fox stating &quot;I came to Cogshall, and there was a meeting of about 2,000 people.&quot; That same year James Parnell, a Quaker, caused a disturbance at the church and was sentenced to prison at Colchester Castle where he died whilst imprisoned in 1656. A meeting house was purchased on Stoneham Street in 1673 with a new building constructed in 1878. A graveyard was purchased on Tilkey Road in 1856 but now forms part of a private garden attached to Quaker Cottage. The meeting house is now home to Coggeshall Library.

Coggeshall has proved an important place in the local Baptist Ministry. For many years congregations met in a house just off Hare Bridge, and in 1797 the first annual meeting of the Essex Baptist Association was held in the Independent Meeting House. A permanent meeting house was constructed in 1825 along Church Street. This building is now used as business offices.

The Methodists have been present in Coggeshall since 1811, worshipping first at a house on Stoneham Street, then a chapel on East Street. A permanent chapel was constructed in 1883 on Stoneham Street to seat 250 people and now hosts a local children&#x27;s nursery.

=== Post reformation Catholics ===
The Catholic parish established in Kelvedon provided for the small Coggeshall catholic community in the Victorian period. In 1914 eleven Catholics were recorded as living in Coggeshall village. A permanent oratory was established at White Barn in 1919, with a Mass held at Starling Leeze, the residence of Captain and Mrs Dixon, from 1922. In 1923 a Mass was held at the Hitcham School every third Sunday using a portable altar, with the closure of this venue the Assembly Room above the Co-operative store was used. In 1927 the congregation had grown to thirty. Captain Kenneth Dixon R.N. died in 1927 and a site for a permanent place of worship was bought in his memory on Stoneham Street, for £200. The chapel of ease, St Bernard&#x27;s of Clairvaux, was opened on Sunday 19 February 1928 with Bishop Doubleday blessing the building. By the 1930s there were seventy people in weekly attendance and by the 1960s the original building was considered to be too small for worship.

==Geography==
Coggeshall is situated on top of a large deposit of London Clay. The main river is the Blackwater with the local Robin&#x27;s Brook feeding into it. Beaumont mentions that there are good bore holes. The current course of the river was dug by the monks, with the original course running to the north. There is a small stream called the &#x27;backditch&#x27; that follows the original route of the river.

==Demography==
==Landmarks==
St Nicholas&#x27; Chapel, Coggeshall Abbey&#x27;s gatehouse chapel, survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries intact, albeit converted into a barn. Subsequently, restored in 1863, it is the oldest surviving post-Roman brick building in the country (c. 1220). The original bricks from the ruins of the abbey are older still, and were made by the monks themselves. These were previously believed to be the oldest post-Roman bricks in the country; however, newer evidence suggests that brick making was not reintroduced to Britain by the Cistercians, but that there was already a brick making industry around Coggeshall in the early 12th century, prompted by the exhaustion of the supply of recyclable Roman bricks.

The Church of St Peter-ad-Vincula (St Peter in chains) is built on an earlier Norman church. It is one of the largest churches in Essex (internal dimensions of 134 ft 6 in by 62 ft 9 in, or 41m by 19m; the tower reaches a height of 72 ft or 22m) and was considered as a possible choice for cathedral, with Chelmsford Cathedral eventually being chosen. The present church was built in the perpendicular style with &#x27;wool money&#x27; during the first quarter of the 15th century; its unusual size is testament to the affluence of the town at the time. Restoration work was carried out during the 19th century. During the Second World War, on 16 September 1940, the Luftwaffe bombed the church causing the roof of the nave to collapse and significant structural damage; repairs were completed in 1956. To celebrate the Millennium two new bells were purchased, bringing the total to ten. Coggeshall hosts the fifth heaviest peal in Essex, the heaviest four being (in descending order) Waltham Abbey, Chelmsford Cathedral, All Saints’ Writtle and All Saints’ West Ham.

Paycocke&#x27;s House was built in or around 1500 by John Paycocke (d. 1505); it is thought it was built as a wedding present for his son Thomas and daughter-in-law Margaret as the initials T.P. and M.P. appear in the wood carvings that decorate the house. The house features elaborate wood panelling and carvings, a testament to the wealth generated by the wool trade in East Anglia. It also features gates which some think were taken from the Abbey at the time of its dissolution. 

The Paycocke family moved into Coggeshall in the 15th century and exemplified a trend for successful butchers to acquire large flocks of their own sheep which would produce wool as well as meat. The wool could be used to make cloth and often the &#x27;grazing butchers&#x27; would eventually evolve into clothiers. These merchants frequently became very wealthy during this process. Thomas was the last Paycocke to live in Coggeshall, dying in 1580. It was the sold to the Buxton family who were clothiers and from 1746 changed hands several times eventually being bought by Lord Noel-Buxton, a descendant of the original Buxtons, and given to The National Trust in 1924. Restoration work was carried out in the 1960s and the house is now open to the public.

Grange Barn was built by the Cistercians in the 13th century to serve the abbey. It is one of the oldest surviving timber-framed buildings in Europe. It was located a quarter of a mile from the Abbey and underwent significant structural alteration in the 14th century. It survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, remaining in continual agricultural use up until 1960 when it was left derelict. It was compulsorily purchased in 1982 by Braintree District Council, who initiated the restoration of the barn, with the work being completed in 1985. In 1989 the barn was given to The National Trust for its future preservation. Although it has undergone extensive reconstruction and its original thatch roof has been replaced with tile, the barn today represents that which existed in the 14th century. Grange Barn is now open to the public showing a collection of farm carts and wagons, and is available to hire for special events.

The Coggeshall clock tower was built to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s jubilee in 1887 and the clockhouse was at one point a school for the poor children of the village and later housed an award-winning tearoom. It is currently a wine bar.

Nunn&#x27;s Bridge, a wrought-iron footbridge on a Public Right of Way crossing the River Blackwater was listed by Historic England in 2020. Erected in 1892, it is unique in its design, and was made and installed by local blacksmith and social campaigner Henry &#x27;Dick&#x27; Nunn after the previous wooden bridge was washed away and authorities refused to replace it. Nunn was an early campaigner for human and animal welfare, and advocate of rights of way in the countryside.

==Culture==
===Coggeshall jobs===

The saying &quot;A Coggeshall job&quot; was used in Essex from the 17th to the 19th century to mean any poor or pointless piece of work, after the reputed stupidity of its villagers. There were numerous stories of the inhabitants&#x27; ridiculous endeavours, such as chaining up a wheelbarrow in a shed after it had been bitten by a rabid dog, for fear it would go mad. John Ray&#x27;s 1670 &quot;Collection of English Proverbs&quot; gives the following rhyme:

The phrase is said to have originated one day when Coggeshall&#x27;s town clock chimed 11 times at noon. When the villagers heard that the town clock at Lexden had struck 12 times at 11 o&#x27;clock, they rode to the town to collect the missing stroke. Other jobs included winching up a cow onto the church roof to eat the grass growing there, knocking down one of two windmills as there would not be enough wind for both of them, attempting to divert the course of the river with hurdles, hanging sheets over roads to prevent the wind from blowing disease into the town, chopping the head off a lamb to free it from a gate, removing stairs from a house to stop flood water entering and some appropriated from other &#x27;fool centres&#x27;, for example the classic &#x27;fishing for the moon&#x27;.

===Local tales===
* Thomas Hawkes burned to death in 1555 during the Marian Persecutions rather than allow his son to be baptised into the Roman Catholic Church. Responding to Edmund Bonner, the Bishop of London, who urged him to return to Catholicism, he is reported to have said: &quot;No my lord, that I will not, for if I had a hundred bodies I would suffer them all to be torn in pieces rather than I will abjure and recant.&quot; As he burned, Hawkes threw up his hands and clapped them three times, a sign to his friends that the pain could be endured. Hawkes&#x27; death and the circumstances leading up to it are recorded in detail in John Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs.
* Mary Honywood of nearby Mark&#x27;s Hall, in an age of religious uncertainty, dashed a wineglass to the floor declaring &quot;I shall be damned as surely as this is smashed&quot;. The wineglass rebounded, unbroken and she lived to the age of 93 years, having 19 children. She is commemorated in the church for having a total of 365 descendants at the time of her death.
* One of the latest recorded witch-hunts in England took place in Coggeshall. It is known from the diary of Joseph Bufton, a resident of the town, that in 1699 the widow Common was tried three times for witchcraft, each time by &#x27;swimming&#x27; – binding her limbs and putting her in the river to see if she would sink. She was found guilty on each occasion but died, probably from influenza, before she could be hanged. Another account is found in the records of the Reverend James Boys, the Vicar of Coggeshall.
* During the Napoleonic Wars Coggeshall was required to raise a company of men for the defence of the country. This they did, although the Coggeshall Volunteers famously consisted of 20 officers and only 3 privates. One resident of the town, the schoolmaster Thomas Harris, was so amused by the situation he was inspired to write a short, satirical play entitled &quot;The C*******ll Volunteer Corps&quot;. In the play he lampooned the surfeit of officers (&quot;As the Corps at present consists mostly of officers no more will be admitted; but should any neighbouring Corps be in want of a few it may be accommodated at the rate of one officer for one private, and in every dozen so exchanged an officer will be thrown in extra. God save the King.&quot;), the quality of the troops and the courage of their commanders (in the event that the nearby town of Colchester was invaded the corps would move to defend Braintree, and if Braintree were to be attacked they would defend Colchester, etc.) The play was so popular it reached four editions. Unfortunately, despite Harris&#x27; insistence that it was not so, many of the town&#x27;s citizens believed that they were being personally caricatured and, taking offence, withdrew their children from his school.
* Mr Nunn, a former blacksmith, is well known for his local deeds. Knowing the Grange Hill to be too steep for horses with heavy loads, he proceeded with others to lower the top and was removed by the police. His most famous deed is the construction of an iron bridge that spans the Blackwater.
* Robin&#x27;s Brook is said to be haunted by the ghost of a woodcutter named Robin.

===Ralph of Coggeshall===
The sixth abbot of Coggeshall&#x27;s abbey (from 1207 to 1218), Lord Ralph was one of the most important chroniclers of his time, described by the historian E. L. Cutts as &quot;a man of polished erudition, as well as of temperance and arrived at such a degree of excellence in literature as to be esteemed by far the first of the brethren of his convent.&quot; He is known particularly for his work in the &quot;Chronicon Anglicanum&quot; (&#x27;Chronicle of English Affairs&#x27;). It is from that work that much of the early history of Coggeshall is known. Due to ill health he ceded his title to the seventh abbot, Lord Benedict de Straford in 1218, living quietly in the Abbey until his death in 1228.

===Coggeshall Gang===
In the 1840s a gang of criminals terrorised Coggeshall and the neighbouring villages. Their headquarters were at the Black Horse Inn on Stoneham Street and their success was due to the unpaid and untrained, spare-time parish constables&#x27; inability to deal effectively with crime in their local area. The gang committed burglaries and violent robberies across Coggeshall, Great Tey, Cressing and Bradwell. Their crimes were often brutal and mainly directed at the elderly. Dell&#x27;s Hole in nearby Earls Colne is named after Mr Dell who was attacked by the gang as he made his way home after a day at Coggeshall market. During a raid on a farmhouse one of the gang was recognised, and was soon arrested: the captain of the gang promised to care for his family if he refused to identify his partners-in-crime. He was sentenced to transportation for fifteen years. After the trial his mother told him his family were not being helped by the gang so he turned Queen&#x27;s evidence. 

The magistrates convened at the Chapel Inn in Coggeshall and sent a posse of the new county police to the Black Horse Inn. Some of the gang were caught there and then, but the gang&#x27;s leader made a daring escape across the rooftops, eventually being arrested trying to board a ship to France. Twenty men were brought to trial at the Shire Hall in Chelmsford, evidence being provided by 700 witnesses. Such was the interest in the gang that the galleries of the courtroom were filled with fashionably dressed women. One of the members was sentenced to hang, commuted to transportation for life, and others were transported to Australia for terms varying from life to seven years. ally farmed a large area of Western Australia and retired to Coggeshall a very wealthy man. Another had farms in Queensland and became a pillar of his local community, while a third ran a successful bakery in Tasmania and mingled with the best of local society. .

The village was featured in the BBC TV series &quot;Lovejoy&quot;.

==Education==
The Cistercians maintained a library at the Abbey. Scholarly works were produced such as Ralph of Coggeshall&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon Anglicanum&quot; and John Godard&#x27;s &quot;Concerning the threefold method of calculating&quot; alongside the ecclesiastical. There was also a school at the Abbey before 1464, in contravention of Cistercian rule.

Sir Robert Hitcham&#x27;s School was founded in 1636 as part of the will of Sir Robert Hitcham, a member of parliament and Attorney General. The school was to educate 20 or 30 of the poorest children of the town and to give them funding for apprenticeships. The school functioned until the mid-20th century, being rebuilt in 1858 on land opposite Paycockes.

A national school was started in 1838–39 when the old workhouse on Stoneham Street was given to the vicar and churchwardens.

The British school was built on land adjoining the Independent Chapel (current-day Christ Church) in 1841 for education of the poor.

In the late 20th century St Peter&#x27;s School Church of England Primary School was opened in the land opposite St. Peter ad Vincula Church. It was rebuilt in the 1980s.

In 2008 a Montessori School was founded in the rooms above Christ Church.

Coggeshall has one comprehensive secondary school called Honywood Community Science School.

<text>A Spy in the House of Love is a 1954 novel by Anaïs Nin. Alongside her other novels, &quot;Ladders to Fire&quot;, &quot;Children of the Albatross&quot;, &quot;The Four-Chambered Heart&quot; and &quot;Seduction of the Minotaur&quot;, it was gathered into a collection known as &quot;Cities of the Interior&quot;. The novel follows the character of Sabina, a woman who enjoys the sexual licence typically associated with men. Sabina wears extravagant outfits and deliberately avoids romantic commitments. She pursues sexual pleasure in isolation of any other romantic attachment.

==Plot summary==

In 1950s New York, protagonist Sabina pursues her sexual desires. She calls a random number from a bar in the middle of the night, seeking to confess or find solace in the voice of a stranger. The stranger happens to be a lie detector who proceeds to follow Sabina in her activities throughout the novel. Her various love interests and her relationship with her husband, Alan, without whom she feels she cannot live, make her life more and more complex. The level of deceit her hedonistic lifestyle forces her to maintain leads her to regard herself as &quot;an international spy in the house of love&quot;.

<text>Stenhousemuir Football Club is a Scottish football club located in Stenhousemuir, Falkirk. They are a member of the Scottish Professional Football League and currently play in Scottish League One.

Through much of its history, the team has competed in the lower leagues of Scottish football, most recently being relegated to Scottish League Two in 2019 via the play-offs one year after being promoted to League One. Stenhousemuir play in 2024–25 Scottish League One after achieving automatic promotion from Scottish League Two.

In September 2009, Stenhousemuir Football Club, Ltd. was re-registered as a Community Interest Company.

== History ==

=== 1884–1989 ===
The club claim to have been founded in 1884 following a breakaway from a local team called Heather Rangers. However this cannot be substantiated through contemporary accounts, for instance it appears Heather Rangers did not exist until much later. There was a Stenhousemuir FC in existence between 1881 and 1885 with the current club not being reported in the press until 1886.

Stenhousemuir Thistle Cricket Club was in existence c.1881. A reference to a &quot;2nd Stenhousemuir (Windsor)&quot;, i.e. a reserve XI, match is made on 18 May 1882. A &quot;Stenhousemuir (Larbert)&quot; away match to Alloa Athletic is listed on 9 September 1882, with Vale of Bannock v Stenhousemuir Thistle on 16 September 1882.

The team line ups for these two matches (one week apart) support Stenhousemuir and Stenhousemuir Thistle as being separate clubs. Stenhousemuir were admitted to the SFA on 21 August 1883 before being struck off from the SFA on 16 August 1885 for non-payment of subscription. This club played in the Scottish Cup in 1883–84 and 1884–85. There is further reference to a Stenhousemuir &quot;junior&quot; team on 13 March 1884. The club were likely not formed as a breakaway from Heather Rangers as they did not exist in 1884 but more likely c.1890.

In 1890, the Warriors moved to Ochilview Park following spells at Tryst Park and Goschen Park. In the early 20th century the club had a brief spell of success, winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup twice in 1901 and 1902. In 1902–03, the club reached the Scottish Cup semi-final, losing 1–4 at home to Rangers. The 1921–22 season saw Stenhousemuir compete for the first time in senior Scottish League Football.

In 1925–26, Stenhousemuir goalkeeper Joe Shortt was offered a £50 bribe to throw a match against Broxburn United, but he rejected the offer and the Warriors won the match 6–2. A bookmaker from the Bainsford district of Falkirk, was subsequently jailed for attempted match fixing.

In 1928, the wooden grandstand at Ochilview Park burnt down in a fire, which led to a new stand being built in its place, although staircases reputedly had to be added later due to planning errors. The 1936–37 season saw the club register a record victory – a 9–2 home win against Dundee United. More than a decade later in 1949–50, a Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against East Fife drew a record crowd of 12,525 – the highest ever at Ochilview Park. On 7 November 1951, the first floodlit game between two Scottish senior teams occurred at Ochilview Park, a friendly match between Stenhousemuir and Hibernian. The floodlights had been paid for three years earlier by Tommy Douglas, a butcher in King Street, Stenhousemuir.

In the middle of 1964, Rangers revealed a plan to The Scottish Football League to remove the Warriors from the league, along with four other clubs, on the basis that they were poorest-supported clubs over the previous three seasons. Four years later, Stenhousemuir, along with Albion Rovers, Berwick Rangers, Brechin City and Stranraer, with support from a number of clubs, including Celtic, Hamilton Academical and Airdrieonians, defeated the plan.

In 1972–73, the Warriors defeated Rangers 2–1 at Ibrox Stadium in Second Round 2nd leg of the Scottish League Cup. Notably, Rangers were the holders of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup at the time. Rangers progressed 6–2 on aggregate having previously won the 1st leg 5–0 at Ochilview.

=== 1990–present ===
In 1992–93, the Club allowed their rivals Stirling Albion to groundshare at Ochilview Park. In the 1993–94 season, the Warriors were moved out of the bottom league for the first time, due to the formation of the Scottish Third Division. The mid-1990s would go on to be one of the club&#x27;s most successful periods in its history.

In 1994–95 they defeated St Johnstone 4–0 and Aberdeen 2–0, both higher league opposition, en route to the Scottish Cup quarter finals. In the 1995–96 season, Stenhousemuir won the Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Dundee United 5–4 on penalties after a goalless 90 minutes and extra time. In the process they reached their first national semi-final since season 1902–03.

In 1997–98, Stenhousemuir were relegated from the Scottish Second Division to the Scottish Third Division for the first time in the history of the club. However, the next season (1998–99) the Warriors won promotion back to the Second Division, also for the first time in the history of the club.

In 2006–07, the Club installed a new synthetic surface at Ochilview Park. It became the first in the UK to pass the FIFA 2 Star category accreditation. A new synthetic surface was installed in the summer of 2014.

At the end of the 2008–09 season, Stenhousemuir were promoted back to the Scottish Second Division (having been relegated from there in season 2002–03) after defeating Cowdenbeath 5–4 on penalties, this after drawing 0–0 on aggregate in the play-off final.

The 2010–11 season saw the Club narrowly avoid another relegation after spending most of the season in the bottom two positions. On the final day of the season the club defeated Peterhead 3–0 to move above Alloa Athletic and therefore avoided the relegation play-offs.

In 2013 Stenhousemuir reached their second Challenge Cup Semi-Final by beating Dundee on penalties after drawing 1–1 but went on to lose 1–0 to Rangers.

In January 2014, after parting company with Martyn Corrigan, the Warriors appointed Scott Booth as their new manager. Booth was relieved of his duties on 1 February 2015 after winning just 12 from 42 games and failing to record any back to back victories.

Assistant Manager, Brown Ferguson, took temporary charge for the second time, and the club announced on 2 April 2015 that &#x27;Bomber&#x27; Brown would take over as manager on a full-time basis for the 2015–16 season.

After a poor season in 2016–17, the club found itself relegated to Scottish League Two. However, the club came straight back up the following season despite finishing in fourth spot, winning promotion through the play-offs after beating Queen&#x27;s Park in the play-off semi-finals and then Peterhead in the final. 2018–19 saw the club relegated back to League Two after defeat to Annan Athletic in the play-offs.

After five seasons in Scottish League Two Stenhousemuir won the first league championship in their 140-year history, winning the title on 6 April 2024 after a 0–0 draw with East Fife.

== Supporters and rivalries ==
Stenhousemuir Supporters&#x27; Trust is the official supporters&#x27; club of Stenhousemuir FC. It is a democratic organisation based on one vote per person, and its committee is elected every year by the members. It is the largest shareholder in the club with about 11% of the shares with the aim to increase the shareholding so that no individual(s) can wrest the control of the club away from its supporters.

The club also draws much international support: the Norwegian Supporters&#x27; Club is a small supporters&#x27; organisation based in Oslo, Norway. The Supporters Club was founded on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1992 by Rolf Erik Wulff, Christian Wulff and Kjell Jarslett. In 1996 it was given one share of Stenhousemuir F.C. as a recognition of their support and promotion of the club. As of today, the supporters club and its members owns about 5% of the shares in Stenhousemuir. Stenhousemuir FC also has Danish support. The Denmark-based supporters club is an unofficial Warriors fan club founded and established in the summer 2000. The fan club has approximately 30 members.

Stenhousemuir Supporters Trust, also known as The &#x27;Warriors Supports Trust&#x27; is registered with the Financial Services Agency as a not-for-profit Industrial and Provident Society. It was established in 2003. It works with the Board of the football club and the Supporters Club to develop a more successful football club. The annual membership subscription of the Trust is £5 but Trust members can take out either a &#x27;silver&#x27; membership of £5 a month, or a &#x27;gold&#x27; membership of £10 a month. The cash obtained from membership of the Trust is used to buy shares the football club has for sale, and hence the club benefits financially. Since its inception the Trust has given money to the club and its members have given their time and labour towards several projects. The current Chairman of the Stenhousemuir Supporters Trust is Graeme Wallace, who is also the stadium announcer at Ochilview.

Notable fans include &quot;The Wire&quot; actor Isiah Whitlock and Monty Python star Michael Palin.

The biggest rivals are East Stirlingshire with whom they share a fierce local rivalry, as they are both from the Falkirk area and have frequently played in the same division as well as sharing the same stadium for a period.
There is a smaller rivalry with Falkirk.

<text>The John Muir Wilderness is a wilderness area that extends along the crest of the Sierra Nevada of California for , in the Inyo and Sierra National Forests. Established in 1964 by the Wilderness Act and named for naturalist John Muir, it encompasses . The wilderness lies along the eastern escarpment of the Sierra from near Mammoth Lakes and Devils Postpile National Monument in the north, to Cottonwood Pass near Mount Whitney in the south. The wilderness area also spans the Sierra crest north of Kings Canyon National Park, and extends on the west side of the park down to the Monarch Wilderness.

==Geography and geology==
The wilderness contains some of the most spectacular and highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada, with 57 peaks over in elevation. The peaks are typically made of granite from the Sierra Nevada Batholith, and are dramatically shaped by glacial action. The southernmost glacier in the United States, the Palisade Glacier, is contained within the wilderness area. Notable east-side glaciated canyons are drained by Rock, McGee and Bishop Creeks.

The eastern escarpment in the wilderness rises from from base to peak, in . The Sierra crest contains peaks from in elevation, including Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the continental United States. Other notable mountains in the wilderness area include the Palisades and Mount Humphreys. Mount Muir is located 2 miles south of Mount Whitney. Mount Williamson is the second-highest peak in the wilderness, at : it rises in one continuous sweep of granite from the floor of the Owens Valley to a peak just east of the main range.

==Ecology==

The John Muir Wilderness contains the largest contiguous area above in the continental United States. It contains large areas of subalpine meadows and fellfields above , containing stands of whitebark and foxtail pine. From to , the wilderness is dominated by lodgepole pines. Below the lodgepole forest is forest dominated by Jeffrey pine.

Common animals in the wilderness include yellow-bellied marmots, pikas, golden-mantled ground squirrels, Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, golden trout, and black bears. The wilderness area also includes California bighorn sheep zoological areas, which are set aside for the protection of the species.

==Recreation==

The wilderness contains of hiking trails, including the John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail, which run through the wilderness from north to south. The John Muir Wilderness is the second most-visited wilderness in the United States, and quotas for overnight use have been implemented on virtually all trailheads.

<doc id="653926" wikidata="Q269674" url="?curid=653926" title="October (U2 album)">
<text>October is the second studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was released on 12 October 1981 by Island Records, and was produced by Steve Lillywhite. The album was lyrically inspired by the memberships of Bono, the Edge, and Larry Mullen Jr. in a Christian group called the Shalom Fellowship, and consequently it contains spiritual and religious themes. Their involvement with Shalom Fellowship led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the &quot;rock and roll&quot; lifestyle, and threatened to break up the band.

After completing the third leg of the Boy Tour in February 1981, U2 began to write new material for &quot;October&quot;, entering the recording studio in July 1981. Just as they did for their 1980 debut, &quot;Boy&quot;, the band recorded at Windmill Lane Studios with Lillywhite producing. The recording sessions were complicated by Bono&#x27;s loss of a briefcase containing in-progress lyrics for the new songs, forcing a hurried, improvisational approach to completing the album on time.

&quot;October&quot; was preceded by the lead single &quot;Fire&quot; in July 1981, while its second single, &quot;Gloria&quot;, coincided with its release. The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play. In 2008, a remastered edition of &quot;October&quot; was released.

==Recording==
In February 1981 during their Boy Tour, U2 began to write new material. (&quot;Fire&quot; had already been recorded at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas while U2 took a break from the Boy Tour.) They wrote part of &quot;October&quot; during an extended sound check at First Avenue in Minneapolis. In March, on an otherwise successful American leg of the tour, the briefcase of lead vocalist Bono containing in-progress lyrics and musical ideas was lost backstage during a performance at a nightclub in Portland, Oregon. The band had limited time to write new music on tour and in July began a two-month recording session at Windmill Lane Studios largely unprepared, forcing Bono to quickly improvise lyrics. Steve Lillywhite, reprising his role as producer from U2&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Boy&quot;, called the sessions &quot;completely chaotic and mad&quot;.

Bono said of the recording process of &quot;October&quot;, &quot;I remember the pressure it was made under, I remember writing lyrics on the microphone, and at £50 an hour, that&#x27;s quite a pressure. Lillywhite was pacing up and down the studio... he coped really well. And the ironic thing about &quot;October&quot; is that there&#x27;s a sort of peace about the album, even though it was recorded under that pressure. A lot of people found &quot;October&quot; hard to accept at first, I mean, I used the word &#x27;rejoice&#x27; precisely because I knew people have a mental block against it. It&#x27;s a powerful word, it&#x27;s lovely to say. It&#x27;s implying more than &#x27;get up and dance, baby.&#x27; I think &quot;October&quot; goes into areas that most rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll bands ignore. When I listen to the album, something like &#x27;Tomorrow,&#x27; it actually moves me.&quot; The briefcase was eventually recovered in October 2004, and Bono greeted its return as &quot;an act of grace&quot;. Whereas Lillywhite recorded Larry Mullen Jr.&#x27;s drums in the stairway of the reception area of Windmill Lane Studios for &quot;Boy&quot;, the producer moved the recording of the drums into the studio for &quot;October&quot;; Lillywhite later called it &quot;one of the things that didn&#x27;t work so well&quot;.

==Composition==

The record placed an emphasis on religion and spirituality, particularly in the songs &quot;Gloria&quot; (featuring a Latin chorus of &quot;Gloria, in te domine&quot;), &quot;With a Shout (Jerusalem)&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow&quot;. About the album, Bono declared in 2005: &quot;Can you imagine your second album—the difficult second album—it&#x27;s about God?&quot;

The songs mainly refine U2&#x27;s formula of riff-rockers with songs such as &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Rejoice&quot;, but the band also expanded its musical palette in a few ways. In particular, guitarist The Edge incorporates piano in songs such as &quot;I Fall Down&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Scarlet&quot;, and &quot;October&quot;. &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, a lament to Bono&#x27;s mother, who died when he was young, features Uilleann pipes played by Vinnie Kilduff later of In Tua Nua. &quot;I Threw a Brick Through a Window&quot; was one of the band&#x27;s first songs to highlight drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., while &quot;Gloria&quot; highlights bassist Adam Clayton as it features three styles of playing in one song (using a pick for the most part, playing with fingers during the slide guitar by The Edge, then a &quot;slap &amp; pop&quot; solo towards the end).

&quot;Is That All?&quot; borrows the riff from &quot;Cry&quot;, an older song the band has used as an introduction to &quot;The Electric Co.&quot; live.

==Release==
&quot;October&quot; was released on 12 October 1981. Both of the album&#x27;s two singles preceded the album&#x27;s release; &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot; were released as singles in July and October 1981, respectively.

&quot;October&quot; was the start of U2&#x27;s vision of the music video as an integral part of the band&#x27;s creative work, as it was released during a time that MTV was first becoming as popular as radio. The video for &quot;Gloria&quot; was directed by Meiert Avis and shot in the Canal Basin in Dublin.

In 2008, a remastered edition of the album was released, featuring remastered tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Three different formats of the remaster were made available.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, &quot;October&quot; received more mixed reviews than its predecessor. Dave McCullough of &quot;Sounds&quot; praised the album and said: &quot;A kind of zenith pop then, no half measures. It all breathes fire, recovering too from the pair of standouts appearing at the start of each side – &#x27;Gloria&#x27; being possibly Their Finest Moment and &#x27;Tomorrow&#x27;, low and muted, gently oozing emotion&quot;. McCullough concluded, &quot;This &quot;October&quot; will last forever&quot;. Adam Sweeting of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; also wrote a favorable review, saying: &quot;Their whole musical sensibility is shaped by a strong emotional bond to their homeland and its traditions. It gives them a completely different frame of reference from most groups, and on &#x27;October&#x27; it&#x27;s given them the strength to assimilate a barrage of disorientation and to turn that into a cohesive body of music.&quot;

In contrast, &quot;NME&quot; published a negative review, in which reviewer Barney Hoskyns noted the &quot;excessive plaintiveness of Bono&#x27;s voice and the forced power of U2&#x27;s sound&quot;. He concluded: &quot;Obviously rock doesn&#x27;t expire just because groups run out of ways to change it... U2, I guess, will continue to &#x27;move&#x27; in live performance, but they will only move on the lightest surface. Their music does &#x27;soar&#x27;... But then &#x27;God&#x27; knows, there are other religions&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the Edge for his powerful guitar playing, &quot;drenched in echo and glory&quot;, but said Bono&#x27;s vocals were negatively impacted by him taking himself too seriously and that his lyrics were silly and clichéd. Pareles acknowledged the band&#x27;s attempts to vary their sound, but said &quot;none of the strategies works as well yet as their basic power-trio dynamics&quot;. In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the band &quot;tries too hard to move forward&quot; on &quot;October&quot;, with Bono straining to make big statements and the music sounding &quot;too pompous&quot;. Erlewine did highlight certain &quot;thoroughly impressive&quot; songs that &quot;marry the message, melody, and sound together&quot;.

==Track listing==

===2008 remastered edition===
On 9 April 2008, U2.com confirmed that &quot;October&quot;, along with the other two of the band&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;War&quot; would be re-released as newly remastered versions. The remastered album was released on 21 July 2008 in the UK, with the U.S. version following it the next day.

<text>The Reverend William Darwin Fox (23 April 1805 – 8 April 1880) was an English clergyman, naturalist, and a second cousin of Charles Darwin.

== Early life ==

Fox was born in 1805 and initially raised at Thurleston Grange near Elvaston, Derbyshire and from 1814 at Osmaston Hall, Osmaston about 2.5 miles (4 km) south of Derby. Fox was the son of Samuel Fox (1765–1851) and his second wife, Ann Darwin (1777–1859).  Ann was the daughter of William Alvey Darwin (1726–1783) and Jane Brown (1746–1835), and niece of Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802).

Fox attended Repton School from 1816 to 1823, when the headmaster was William Boultbee Sleath. Like his second cousin Charles Darwin, Fox prepared for the church at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was also a naturalist and entomologist, particularly collecting butterflies. At Cambridge, Fox and Darwin became friends, and Fox tutored his younger cousin on natural history. Darwin noted in his autobiography:

Fox introduced Darwin to another parson-naturalist, John Stevens Henslow, who held a weekly open house which undergraduates and some older members of the University interested in science attended in the evenings. Darwin spent three weeks with Fox at Osmaston Hall in the summer of 1829. Throughout his life, Fox remained in regular contact with Charles Darwin, and many of the letters exchanged discussed Darwin&#x27;s work.

== Country vicar ==

Fox graduated from Cambridge in the winter of 1829 and took up a curacy at Epperstone, near Nottingham. He was forced to take sick leave in 1833 and convalesced at Sandown on the Isle of Wight. It was here that he met his first wife Harriet Fletcher and they were married in 1834. Fox returned to Epperstone for a short time but was appointed vicar of Delamere, Cheshire in 1838; he remained the incumbent there until he retired through ill health in 1873. Fox was active in the local community at Delamere, especially the local school where he taught, which is now called Fox&#x27;s school.

== Man of letters ==

The letters that Charles Darwin sent to Fox were recognised as an important primary source of information on the life of Charles Darwin by his son Francis Darwin, and by many biographers since. Some are published in &quot;Life and Letters of Charles Darwin&quot; (Edited by F. Darwin, 1887). Most of these letters are at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Some of the letters of Fox to Darwin are extant. Darwin used much information given by Fox in his books.
Fox also kept a diary from the age of 18 to 1878. Only one year is missing: for 1828, when he resided at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge with Charles Darwin. A microfiche copy of the diaries are in the University Library, Cambridge. Fox never fully accepted Darwin&#x27;s explanation of evolution.

Fox in his own non-scientific but reasoned way contributed to the understanding of the geology of the Solent and how the Isle of Wight became separated from the mainland when he gave a very informative opinion on this matter in a reply to a correspondent to the &quot;Geologist&quot; (Fox 1862).

When Fox retired as Rector of Delamere in 1873, he returned to the Isle of Wight to live at &quot;Broadlands&quot;, Sandown, until his death in 1880 and is buried on the Isle of Wight.

== Marriages and children ==
Fox married twice and had 17 children. His first wife was Harriet Fletcher, (1799–1842), daughter of Sir Richard Fletcher and Elizabeth Mudge, whom he married in 1834.

Their children were:
*a stillborn girl born in 1834;
*Eliza Ann (1836-1874), wife of Rev. Henry Martyn Sanders
*Harriet Emma born 1837, wife of Samuel Charlesworth Overton
*Agnes Jane (1839–1906)
*Julia Mary Anne born 1840, wife of Samuel Everard Woods
*and Samuel William Darwin born 1841

His second wife, whom he married in 1846, was Ellen Sophia (1820–1887), daughter of Basil George Woodd and Mary Mitton of Hillfield, Hampstead.

Their children were:
*Charles Woodd (1847–1908)
*Frances Maria (1848–1921), wife of Alexander Pearce
*Robert Gerard (1849–1909)
*Louisa Mary (1851–1853)
*Ellen Elizabeth (1852–1923), wife of Baron Dickinson Webster
*Theodora (1853–1878)
*Gertrude Mary (1854–1900), wife of Frederick Charles Tindal Bosanquet
*Frederick William (1855–1931)
*Edith Darwin (1857–1892)
*Erasmus Pullien (1859–1939)
*Reginald Henry (1860–1933)
*Gilbert Basil (1865–1941)

Following the birth of the Foxes&#x27; 10th child, Charles Darwin made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the size of the Fox family and the trouble boys created compared with girls; in a letter to Fox in 1852.

==Confusion with William Fox the palaeontologist==
There is considerable confusion between Fox and his less celebrated contemporary the synonymic Rev. William Fox (1813–1881) who was also an amateur scientist and lived and worked on the Isle of Wight at the same time. William Darwin Fox is sometimes ascribed the credit for early dinosaur discoveries. William Darwin Fox was noted for his geological work, and entomology, but is not recorded as having any particular interest in dinosaurs.

William Johnson Fox

==Confusion with social reformer William Johnson Fox==
Another source of confusion links to Charles Darwin. Writer Harriet Martineau became prominent through the Unitarian publication The Repository, edited by then-Rev. William Johnson Fox. Moving to London around 1830, she joined Fox&#x27;s social circle of prominent thinkers which eventually linked her to Erasmus Alvey Darwin. Charles Darwin moved in with his brother in 1837 and both got to know Martineau to the extent that their family worried about either marrying the outspoken writer. The Darwin were cousins to William Darwin Fox. Meanwhile, Martineau&#x27;s popularization of Thomas Malthus&#x27; theories of population control may have helped lead Charles Darwin to read Malthus.

<doc id="653931" wikidata="Q1227651" url="?curid=653931" title="New Alresford">
<text>New Alresford or simply Alresford ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the City of Winchester district of Hampshire, England. It is northeast of Winchester and southwest of the town of Alton.

New Alresford, situated with the River Alre to its north, has a remarkably well preserved 17th and 18th Century high street which offers several shops, a tourist information centre, a central conservation area, and several tea rooms and pubs. The western terminus of the Watercress Line heritage railway is at Alresford railway station in the town.

==Etymology==
Although Alresford is recorded in several Anglo-Saxon charters these records are in reference to Old Alresford the older of the two settlements. Alresford derived from the Old English &quot;Alor&quot; and &quot;ford&quot; meaning the ford at the Alder tree.

New Alresford itself was founded as a market town in 1189 and is first mentioned in a record of the mid 1200s as &quot;Nova Villa de Alresford&quot;, Latin for the &quot;new settlement of Alresford&quot;. In 1332 &quot;Chepyng Alresford&quot; is recorded denoting a market town, from Middle English &quot;chippyng&quot;.

==History==
There is evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age occupation on several sites in the Alresford area, with a Roman or Romano-British site on nearby Fobdown and to the south-east of the town in Bramdean. Alresford was listed in the Domesday Book but this refers to what is now Old Alresford a short distance to the north of the river. Old Alresford is near to the Pilgrims&#x27; Way between Winchester and Canterbury which from Alresford goes east to Farnham, Guildford, Dorking and Maidstone.

An Early Medieval Anglo-Saxon cemetery was discovered during pre-construction excavations near Sun Lane to the southeast of Alresford. Of the total 120 graves, many contained prestige objects like swords or in some cases even golden disc pendant. Its presence as one of the largest cemeteries of its date in Hampshire suggests significant occupation in the surrounding area prior to the founding of New Alresford. 

New Alresford was founded in the 12th/13th century, the idea originally being that of Henri de Blois, the Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen of England. The design of the town (originally named Novum Forum) was followed by de Blois&#x27; successor Godfrey de Lucy. Alresford was one of the Bishop&#x27;s six new towns and was his most profitable — one of his residences was situated in Bishop&#x27;s Sutton about a mile to the east. 
This expansion also involved the construction of the Great Weir, an earth dam across the river south of Old Alresford, allowing the river to form Alresford Pond on what is now the north side of New Alresford village.Today, Alresford pond is at the centre of a 30.2-hectare (75-acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest.
A medieval stone bridge said to have been built about 1190 built is still in place on the north side of New Alresford and the flow of water through is the main outflow from Alresford Pond. 

New Alresford became established as a prosperous market town on the main road from Alton to Winchester south of the river. Commerce focussed on products from sheep and cattle such as wool and leather; and in the 14th century Alresford sheep markets were said to produce one of five highest turnovers in England. 

Alresford sent two members to parliament until the population was reduced by the Black Death in 1348. In the 17th century the town made news as a dangerous place to live due to the uncommonly frequent fires which razed it; in the spring of 1644, the Battle of Cheriton took place on Cheriton Down, reaching the outskirts of Alresford.

Much of the medieval town was destroyed by a fire in 1689/90 that destroyed 117 houses in the town as well as the church and Market House, another in 1710 and a &#x27;like calamity&#x27; in 1736. Much of the town was rebuilt in the 18th century, with many of the Georgian buildings that remain today.
A turnpike toll road linking London to primarily Southampton but viable for Hamble and Portsmouth (now the A31), some of which was a Roman road then a track in variable condition maintained by each parish, was built in 1753, passing through the town.
During the late 18th century, Alresford Cricket Club was one of the strongest sides in England. Alresford Community Centre, formerly Alresford Town Hall, was completed in 1865.

During the Second World War US Soldiers from the 47th Infantry Regiment were stationed in and around Alresford from 1943 to 1944 prior to the D-Day Landings. The regimental HQ was situated in Broad street. There is a memorial to their mascot Hambone jr. alongside the river path and a plaque on the former HQ building.

A Cold War commemorative plaque on the wall of public toilets, close to the railway station, commemorates that occasionally secret military documents obtained by members of the Portland Soviet spy ring in the early 1960s were left here for collection.

==Art and tourism==

The town, crowned by its large T-shaped main street conservation area, is an attractive art, rail and tourist destination, with its two classical, dense Georgian streets. Here can be found the Swan Hotel, Bell Hotel, jewellers, wine merchants, butchers, flower shops, toy shop, dress shops, the Alresford Gallery, Candover Gallery and tea rooms. There are three other public houses, the largest being the Globe Inn, by one of the stream channels and the play area. 

===Alresford railway station===
Alresford railway station is at the south-western end of the Watercress Line – officially the Mid-Hants Railway. This heritage railway line runs steam and diesel trains, and gained its nickname from the fact that it used to be the line that took locally grown watercress up to London. The other end of the heritage line is , which is also the terminus of the Alton line, enabling rail access for visitors from London.

===St John&#x27;s Church===
The 13th-century church of St John the Baptist was rebuilt in 1898 by Sir Arthur Blomfield in the Norman gothic perpendicular style, except the 14th-century tower, although the top third of the tower is of 16th-century red crenellated parapet brickwork.

===Brandy Mount House===
Brandy Mount House is a Grade II listed building and is a short distance east of the church. In 2012 it was holding a National Plant Collection of snowdrops in its grounds. The gardens were open to the public during the season.

===Water Cascade===
The overflow from New Alresford Pond flows down a stepped cascade at Mill Hill, then travels downstream to the river Itchen.

===Itchen Valley brewery===
The Itchen Valley brewery was founded in New Alresford in 1997. 
The brewery produced a range of cask ales and a selection of beers which until early 2006 were bottle conditioned by Gales Brewery. The brewery closed in 2021, a victim of poor trading during Covid.

===The Fulling Mill===
 About west along the river path, on the border between Old and New Alresford, is a Grade II listed 17th Century half-timbered house and mill with mill race underneath. It benefited from the construction of the Great Weir. Dating from the period when the wool trade was the dominant local industry, it ceased operating early in the 19th century and has been used as a domestic dwelling ever since. In 1950 it was acquired by Mr and Mrs G B Gush, who carried out a series of improvements to the property.

==Education==
There is one infant, one junior and one secondary school in Alresford with more than 140 staff and 2,000 pupils – Perins School (1,200 pupils –secondary school). This school converted to Academy status in 2011 and in September 2017 formed a Multi-Academy Trust (MAT) with Sun Hill Junior School. In 2001 Perins was granted specialist status for leading the field in sport in Hampshire. This enabled Perins to open and complete a new state-of-art gym open to the public in the evenings, although the school no longer carries the title Community Sports College.

==Sport and leisure==
Alresford has a Non-League football club Alresford Town F.C., which plays at Arlebury Park.
Alresford is also home to a rugby club, Alresford RFC, which plays its home games at Arlebury Park in the centre of Alresford.

==Transport==
New Alresford was formerly on both the A31 road between Guildford and Winchester, and on the Watercress Line, a secondary main line of the London &amp; South Western Railway between Alton and Winchester. However the A31 now by-passes the town, whilst the old road through the town has been redesignated the B3047. The Watercress Line was closed in 1973, although the section between New Alresford and Alton is now operated as a heritage railway under the same name.

The town is served by a two bus routes operated by Stagecoach in Hampshire including the half hourly number 64 (and 64X) bus between Winchester and Alton via New Alresford and the number 67 providing a more limited service between Winchester and Petersfield via New Alresford.

==Events==
Alresford holds a number of community events throughout the year. Several are organised by or with New Alresford Town Council (NATC). All events which are held in the main streets within the original town (Broad Street, East Street, West Street) require the permission of the New Alresford Town Trust (NATT – a registered charity which preserves the town&#x27;s traditional rights of access, to fairs and to street markets, preserves old documents and buildings, and runs a community minibus). A fee for street usage is usually payable by organisers, which helps in the Trust&#x27;s other works, including running the local minibus which serves the elderly and disabled. A number of events are organised by The Alresford Pigs Association, which raises money in the local area for those in need, by the local Rotary club (such as the annual 5 November Fireworks at Arlebury Park), and by the town council.

===The Watercress Festival===
The town is famed for its production of watercress and is recognised as The Capital of Watercress. Once a year New Alresford holds a festival on the third Sunday in May which attracts an enormous crowd; there is a street market with locally made food on sale and usually cookery demonstrations. From 2006 to 2008, Antony Worrall Thompson was the celebrity chef.

===Alresford Show===

The agricultural show, founded in 1908 and held at Tichborne Park since 1960, takes place on the first Saturday in September. Animals are shown, flowers and vegetables are judged, there is horsejumping and other entertainment. The Alresford Pigs and Alresford Rugby Club assist. Entry is chargeable.

===Alresford fair===
A one-day street fair takes place on 11 October (Old Michaelmas Day) or the first Thursday thereafter. The traditional English funfair, arrives on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning and sets up in Broad Street. The fair lasts from 3pm – 11pm and has to be gone by dawn on Friday. The main north–south road of Alresford (Broad Street) is closed to traffic.

===Bonfire night===
Organised by the local Rotary Club and usually held on 5 November. Traditionally the firework display is preceded by a torchlit procession starting in Broad Street making its way along West Street and up Pound Hill into Arlebury Park, the venue for the firework display. The display is always well attended with proceeds donated to local, national and international causes. Each year a &#x27;Guy&#x27; is burned following tradition, with the Guys made by local schoolchildren.

===Arrival of Father Christmas===
The arrival of Father Christmas is a joint effort led by the Christmas Tree Fund. It takes place in Broad Street near a large Christmas Tree erected annually. A carol service with music provided by Perins Community School&#x27;s orchestra precedes the arrival. The Alresford Pigs create the secret process by which Father Christmas arrives. He has arrived in World War 2 NAAFI van driven by Wallace and Gromit and in a Thunderbirds, helicopter, fire engine, Open-top bus, Tardis, and a BMW 5 Series. This is followed by Father Christmas giving presents to children in his grotto. The presents are organised by the Christmas Tree Fund. Money donated by the crowd at each year&#x27;s event goes back into the pot for the following year.

===The Duck Race===
The Duck Race is organised by the Alresford Pigs and held biennially on odd numbered years. It brings the community out to watch several (decoy) duck races with 32 ducks in each race. The event, races and ducks are sponsored by a local family or business. It has been held for many years on the lawn at the Weir House, which has space for traditional fete activities such as Tea and Cake, Beer Tent, Tombola, as well as Scalextric Racing, Face Painting, Bouncy Castle, and Jazz Band. This is the largest fundraising event organised by The Alresford Pigs.

==Charity==
After the borough council was abolished under the Municipal Corporations Act 1883, its assets were transferred to the New Alresford Town Trust, which was constituted in 1890.

==Governance==
Alresford is part of the wider Itchen Valley Ward of Hampshire County Council, which stretches across the Northeast of the City of Winchester and includes several other parishes such as Itchen Valley. Itchen Valley has been represented since 2005 by Jackie Porter, most recently elected in 2017:



Alresford also elects three representatives to the City of Winchester District Council as part of the wider Alresford and Itchen Valley Ward. As with the Hampshire County Council War, this also includes Old Alresford. The ward is currently represented by one Conservative Councillor and two Liberal Democrat Councillors:

The town council holds elections, and is currently composed of eleven Councillors and six members of staff.

<doc id="653941" wikidata="Q16831" url="?curid=653941" title="Aerozine 50">
<text>Aerozine 50 is a 50:50 mix by weight of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), developed in the late 1950s by Aerojet General Corporation as a storable, high-energy, hypergolic fuel for the Titan II ICBM rocket engines. Aerozine continues in wide use as a rocket fuel, typically with dinitrogen tetroxide () as the oxidizer, with which it is hypergolic. Aerozine 50 is more stable than hydrazine alone, and has a higher density and boiling point than UDMH alone.

Pure hydrazine has a higher performance than Aerozine 50, but an inconvenient freezing point of 2 °C. A mix of hydrazine and UDMH has a far lower freezing point due to freezing-point depression. In addition, UDMH is a more stable molecule; this reduces the risk of pure hydrazine decomposing unexpectedly, increasing safety and allowing the blend to be used as a coolant in regeneratively cooled engines.

This type of fuel is mainly used for interplanetary probes and spacecraft propulsion. Unlike other more common propellants like liquid oxygen or liquid hydrogen, Aerozine 50 is liquid at room temperature and can be stored in liquid state without significant boil off, thus making it a storable propellant better suited for long-term interplanetary missions. Aerozine 50 was largely used in ICBMs and in their derivative launchers such as the core stages of the Titan-II/III/IV rocket because an ICBM requires long-term storage and launch on short notice; the rocket must be stored already fueled. This fuel was also used in ICBM-derived upper stages, such as the Delta II rocket. It was also used by the Apollo Lunar Module and the Service Propulsion System engine in the Apollo CSM. The Ariane 1 through Ariane 4 family used a related fuel, a mixture of 75% UDMH and 25% hydrazine hydrate called UH 25.

Aerozine is &quot;not&quot; used as a monopropellant (a propellant that is not mixed with anything). The extra stability conferred by the methyl groups affects reactivity and thrust.

In 1980, an accidental leakage of Aerozine 50 resulted in the 1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion. The leak occurred due to puncture of the first-stage Titan fuel tank by a dropped tool. The initial explosion removed the 740-ton silo door and ejected the second stage and warhead out of the silo. The Titan&#x27;s second stage exploded, and the W53 warhead landed 30 meters from the silo portal without detonating or leaking fissile material.

== Alternatives ==
Hydrazine may also be mixed with monomethyl hydrazine (MMH). Because MMH is slightly denser, net performance is increased slightly.

A potentially novel hypergolic alternative has been developed based on tertiary amine azides – called CINCH (Competitive Impulse Non-Carcinogenic Hypergol) and the name of the compound is 2-Dimethylaminoethylazide.

== Trivia ==
According to John D. Clark, the propellant community disliked and ignored brandnames such as Aerojet&#x27;s Aerozine, preferring its own jargon of engineering acronyms and nicknames. This particular mixture was called &quot;50–50&quot;.

<text>The Watercress Line is the marketing name of the Mid-Hants Railway, a heritage railway in Hampshire, England, running from New Alresford to Alton where it connects to the National Rail network. The line gained its popular name in the days when it was used to transport locally grown watercress to markets in London. The railway currently operates regular scheduled services, along with dining trains, real ale trains and numerous special events throughout the year.

== History ==

=== British Railways ownership ===
In 1861, the Alton, Alresford and Winchester Railway Company was authorised to build a new railway to connect to the existing London &amp; South Western Railway lines at Alton and Winchester. It was opened on 2 October 1865 as the Mid-Hants Railway. Trains were operated by the London &amp; South Western Railway which eventually purchased the Mid-Hants Railway Company in 1884.

Stations were initially constructed at Itchen Abbas, Ropley and Alresford. The station at was already in existence. The station at Medstead and Four Marks was added in 1868. Just outside this station, the line is at its highest point ( above sea level) having risen from Alresford ( above sea level) and descending to Alton ( above sea level). The section of line became known as &quot;the Alps&quot;, due to the steep gradients that exist there.

The line provided an alternative route between London and Southampton and, besides transporting locally produced watercress, was particularly important for military traffic between the army town of Aldershot and the military embarkation port at Southampton.

With the development of motorised transport, the line declined during the inter-war and post-war periods of the 20th century and was further compromised by the closures of the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway in 1932 and the Meon Valley Railway in 1955. Electrification of the line from London to Alton in 1937 meant that the Watercress Line was no longer part of a through route; it became necessary to change at Alton. Electrification of the line from London to Southampton occurred in 1967, which further affected the economics of the Mid-Hants route.

The line became part of the Southern Railway in 1923 and then part of the Southern Region of British Railways in 1948. It survived the Beeching Axe in 1963, but was eventually closed by British Railways in February 1973. During final years of operation under British Rail, passenger train services were operated by Class 205 (&quot;2H&quot;) two carriage diesel-electric multiple units.

In 1941, prototype Merchant Navy Class 21C1 &quot;Channel Packet&quot; travelled as far as Alresford after the naming ceremony at Southampton for a trial run with press and dignitaries.

=== Heritage railway ===

The section of line from Alresford to Alton that can be seen today was purchased from British Rail in November 1975. Reconstruction of the line subsequently progressed in stages. The section between Alresford and Ropley re-opened on 30 April 1977. To provide engineering and maintenance facilities, the main locomotive shed and workshops were constructed at Ropley. The extension to Medstead &amp; Four Marks opened on 28 May 1983 and the final section to Alton opened on 25 May 1985.

On 12 June 1982, a replica of &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; visited the Watercress Line, running successfully under its own power from Ropley to Alresford.

Some of the structures that can be seen on the line today were not part of the original railway infrastructure; they have been added to make the line serviceable again and to recreate the feel of a fully operational steam railway. The line is now maintained by a small base of paid staff (mostly in administrative duties) and a core of over 400 volunteers.

The railway is a registered charity.

== Locomotives and rolling stock ==

The Mid-Hants Railway plays host to a large collection of steam and diesel locomotives, passenger carriages and restored wagons, most of which are from the 1920s to 1960s period. Steam locomotives operated include Bulleid Pacifics of the Merchant Navy and West Country, SR Lord Nelson class, Schools Class, S15, BR Standard Class 4, BR Standard Class 9F, LMS Ivatt Tank, and a Black 5. Operated alongside these are a number of diesel locomotives including Class 33s, a Class 47, a Class 50, a Class 03 shunter, Class 08 shunters, a Class 11 shunter, and a Class 205 &quot;Hampshire&quot; multiple unit.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Stations of the Watercress Line ===

The Watercress Line has four stations on the site of former British Rail stations. Each features a passing loop, allowing trains to pass one another, or locomotives to run round trains for a change of direction of travel. Alton station has three platforms, platforms 1 and 2 being operated by the national rail network, and platform 3 by the Watercress Line. The other three stations each have two platforms with connecting footbridges.

* – at the north-east end of the line. Alton has one passenger platform (two others are assigned to South Western Railway), with a cross-platform connection to the town and onward services to London Waterloo. Alton has two passing loops, one within station limits, and another just outside, allowing trains to pass outside the station, thus reducing the impact of the single platform during intensive operations. There are several additional sidings.
* – the highest station in Hampshire, fully restored in the style of a quiet 1940s Southern Railway station. The line&#x27;s Signal and Telegraph department, Permanent Way group, and Building department are all located here, in and around the station yard. There are several sidings. This is where the greatest number of trains pass each other on standard running days.
* – the engineering centre of the line and the location of the locomotive maintenance and running sheds. The station has flower beds and topiary, and the largest of the line&#x27;s four signal boxes, controlling movements through the station, as well as much shunting to and from the locomotive yard.
*Alresford – at the southern end of the line is the top visitor station and has the most passenger facilities, including a museum, buffet and two shops. Most of the carriage stock is stored at this station, with Alresford Train Care performing day-to-day maintenance and cleaning of the carriages.

=== Imported structures ===

=== Signalling and safety systems ===

*Alton signal box – A new signalling installation has been commissioned at Alton. It is a colour-light system, running from the signal box control panel; this contrasts with the mechanical semaphore signals used on the rest of the line. The new system allows a more intensive train service, making use of the loop, and allows shunting within the station, operations which the previous manual flag signalling did not allow. The new installation makes use of track circuits to detect where the train is situated and can change points and signals accordingly. It can run fully automatically, so there is no need for a signalman, unlike the other signal boxes on the line. When there is no signalman, all Signal Post Telephones are diverted to Medstead &amp; Four Marks signal box. It works on a system where a member of the locomotive crew inserts the token into a token switch, to allow the system to take the next steps.
*Ropley signal box – Phase One of the Ropley re-signalling project, construction of the new signal box, has been completed. Phase Two was expected to be completed in 2012. Phase Two will include installation of working distant signals, in place of the existing fixed distant signals. The new signals will be motorised semaphore signals as they are too far from the signal box to be operated mechanically without considerable physical effort by the signalman. The scheme will also include installing Advanced Starting and Outer Home signals in both directions.
*AWS (Automatic Warning System) – The Watercress Line is currently the only heritage railway with a complete AWS system. It is used on all distant signals on the line and at all signals in the Alton colour light area, until an AWS gap is reached before the Meon Loop due to the large number of signals. Almost all of the locomotives and multiple units are fitted with it, apart from a couple of steam locomotives.
*Train Protection &amp; Warning System – TPWS is not used by the Watercress Line, however the Class 205 Hampshire Unit has TPWS fitted.

== Future developments ==
Before its closure, the railway joined the South West Main Line at Winchester Junction, two miles (3 km) north of Winchester. The cheapest viable proposals to reinstate the tracks to rejoin Winchester, calling for platforms, embankments, earth cuttings and/or tunnels, have proven too expensive to submit to government or large charities. The track would need to cross the M3 motorway and replace or tunnel underneath houses and gardens built across the right-of-way between the former other junction of the railway (with electrified railways) and Itchen Abbas.

=== 2008 lottery grant ===
Upon bidding, in October 2008 the Mid Hants Railway received £550,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) for improvement projects.

A new two-track carriage and wagon workshop has been built at Ropley, capable of holding four carriages under cover. The workshop is intended to meet the particular needs for the restoration of wooden vehicles with woodworking machinery, a retained carpenter and apprentice/trainee carpenters.

Extensions to the locomotive workshop are a small machine shop, stores area and a set of volunteers&#x27; refreshment and changing facilities. Viewing platforms for visitors take in the locomotive and carriage workshops and the boiler workshop. Materials and displays for interpretation and overview are provided to educate visitors in the work and trades used to maintain and improve a largely manually-maintained, bespoke set of rolling stock.

A historic signal box assisted by a grant from the Railway Heritage Trust is installed at Medstead. It provides a hands-on signalling experience for visitors together with space for an exhibition of Strowger telephone equipment.

The cost of this round of projects exceeded £1m, assisted by funds within the railway and by additional volunteer labour.

The railway was successful in gaining two previous HLF awards: the Old Goods Shed at Alresford was restored and opened in 2000; the wheel drop shed at Ropley was built in 2005.

== Incidents ==
There have been some incidents at the Watercress Line over its history. Most incidents are confined to mechanical failure of railway systems. On 26 July 2010, a fire broke out in the newly constructed Carriage and Wagon workshop at Ropley station.

<doc id="653946" wikidata="Q3643383" url="?curid=653946" title="Kenneth Meshoe">
<text>Kenneth Rasalabe Joseph Meshoe (born 18 January 1954) is a South African evangelist, politician, reverend and teacher. He has been serving as the inaugural leader of the African Christian Democratic Party, a Christian democratic political party, since 1993. He became a Member of Parliament in 1994 and has since been re-elected five times. He is one of the longest-serving MPs.

==Early life, education and career==
Meshoe was born on 18 January 1954 in Pretoria, South Africa. He matriculated from high school in 1972 and went on to study at the University of the North where he obtained a Secondary Teachers Diploma in 1975. He then proceeded to work as a teacher for the next few years.

He and his wife, Lydia, joined the Christ for all Nations in 1976. In February 1980, he found employment as one of Reinhard Bonnke&#x27;s associate evangelists. He completed his second-year Theological Diploma at the Shekinah Bible Institute in Kingsport in the US state of Tennessee in 1987.

He established his church, the Hope of Glory Tabernacle, in 1988, when he returned to South Africa. In 1994, the Bethel Christian College of Riverside, California, awarded him an Honorary Doctorate (Doctor of Humane Letters). He was also appointed to serve as an Associate Member on the Board of Regents of Bethel College.

==Political career==

Meshoe established the ACDP in December 1993. The party competed in the 1994 general elections and won two seats in the newly established National Assembly. Meshoe filled one of the seats.

The party&#x27;s support peaked in the 2004 general election when it won seven parliamentary seats and representation in six provincial legislatures. Meshoe was consequently re-elected as an MP. After the 2004 election, the ACDP started to decline in each election. The party managed to arrest the decline in the 2019 general election. Meshoe is currently serving his sixth term as an MP. He is a member of the Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation.

===Political positions===
Meshoe voted against the adoption of the final version of the South African constitution in 1996. He also opposes abortion. He voted against the legalisation of same-sex marriage in South Africa.

Meshoe has voiced support for the previous DA mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, Athol Trollip. He has also spoken out on the issue of farm murders.

Meshoe has voiced support for the State of Israel, arguing against claims that Israel is an apartheid state, calling such accusations &quot;slanderous&quot; and &quot;deceptive&quot;. According to Meshoe, these claims trivialise the word apartheid, and belittle the magnitude of the racism and suffering endured by non-white South Africans during the apartheid era.

==Personal life==
Meshoe married Lydia Meshoe in 1976, with whom he went on to have three children, including Olga Meshoe Washington. Meshoe and Lydia renewed their vows in 2016. Lydia had previously served as a representative of the ACDP in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. On 25 January 2023, the ACDP announced that Lydia had died. 
Reverend Meshoe remarried Wonkie Ncoco, a former ANC MP in 2024.

Meshoe underwent a COVID-19 test on 22 March 2020 after he participated in a religious gathering in the Free State with five infected international guests.
The ACDP deputy leader Wayne Thring announced on 27 March that Meshoe and fellow ACDP MP Steven Swart had tested positive for the virus. Meshoe did not show any symptoms, while Swart experienced flu-like symptoms. They were the first South African MPs to test positive for the virus.

<text>Richard Tighe Harris (October 31, 1833 – October 11, 1907) was an Irish American miner and prospector.

==Life==
Richard Harris was born in Banbridge, County Down, Ireland. He then attended Girard College, a private boarding school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

He is most famous for co-founding, with Joe Juneau, the city of Juneau, Alaska. The first major gold discovery in Juneau or Douglas Island (across from Juneau) was around 1880. It has been the political capital of Alaska since 1906.

His Native American guide in southeastern Alaska was Chief Kowee. Kowee is credited with discovering much of the Juneau area. Richard and Joe were sent with Kowee by George Pilz, an entrepreneur from Sitka. Harris and Juneau traded with the natives much of their for hoochinoo. When they returned to Pilz empty-handed, he sent them back to the Juneau area. There, Kowee took them beyond Gold Creek (which today flows beside the Hurff Ackerman Saunders Federal Building and Robert Boochever U.S. Courthouse) to Silver Bow Basin. Today, a creek on Douglas Island is named Kowee Creek.

After the discovery of gold in Juneau, Harris and Juneau loaded approximately 1,000 pounds of gold ore back to Sitka.

The town did not take its current name immediately; originally, it was known as Harrisburg, Pilzburg, and Rockwell. Juneau was able to buy votes from enough of his fellow miners for the name to be changed. Today, Harris Street still exists in Juneau. Harris lived most of the remainder of his life in Juneau; later he was moved to a nursing home in Oregon, where he died.

Both Harris and Juneau are buried in the city&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery.

<doc id="653953" wikidata="Q1884466" url="?curid=653953" title="Ropley">
<text>Ropley is a village and large civil parish in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. It has an acreage of , situated east of New Alresford. It is served by a station on the Mid Hants Railway heritage line at Ropley Dean, just over from the village shops. It is southwest of Alton, just off the A31 road. It lies within the diocese of Winchester.

The St Swithun&#x27;s Way, part of the Pilgrims&#x27; Way from Winchester to Canterbury, passes through the village.

It is distinguished by its general absence of pavements in favour of boundary walls, hedges and mature trees. Ropley holds an annual Boxing Day walk, and a pram race on the spring bank holiday in May.

==Etymology==
Ropley is first recorded in AD 1167 as &quot;Ropeleia&quot;. The name is derived from the Old English personal name &quot;Hroppa&quot;, cognate to modern day Robert, and the common suffix &quot;léah&quot; which means meadow, small woodland or woodland clearing. The latter meaning is most likely, hence Ropley is translatable as &#x27;Robert&#x27;s woodland clearing&#x27; which would have been known to Anglo-Saxon locals as &quot;Hroppanleah&quot;.

Ropley&#x27;s etymology is also related to that of the hamlet of Lyeway about 2.25 km away. Lyeway is first recorded in 1327 in the personal name &quot;John atte Ligheweye&quot;. The name refers to a way or lane that led to the &quot;léah&quot;; in other words, Lyeway translates as the &#x27;lane to Ropley&#x27;.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Ropley has seen human activity and presence since the Lower Palaeolithic evidenced by a number of handaxes collected in the parish over the last few decades. Later Stone Age evidence from the Mesolithic and Neolithic is also very numerous and particularly evidence from the Neolithic suggest occupation and possibly even flint mining in the vicinity.

The Bronze Age activity in the village is significant with one of the most impressive gold armillas- also known as a torc, found in the village in 1843. Additionally a large number of Early Bronze Age barrows can be found in the parish, suggesting a community somewhere in the vicinity. 

Iron Age evidence is numerous in the village and its surroundings. Several crop marks of banjo enclosures and smaller enclosures can be seen throughout the parish on satellite imagery. Additionally artefacts such as brooches, coins and pottery have been found in significant quantities.

During the Roman occupation the village saw its fair share of activity. It seems one, or possibly several roman roads passed through the village the largest of which was the main thoroughfare that connected London with Winchester. Settlement in Ropley at this time consisted of farmsteads and smaller settlements situated on the site of older Iron Age settlements, however no evidence of villas have been found within the parish.

===The Middle Ages===

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Ropley was part of the &quot;Hundred of Bishops Sutton&quot; (or &quot;Ashley&quot;). Ropley is supposed to have provided the honey for William the Conqueror&#x27;s mead, although there is no evidence for this, and is likely a myth of later creation.

====The Gervais family====
By the 13th century much of the manor of Ropley was owned by the Gervase family (also written as Gervais, Gervas, Gervase, Gerveis and Jervays). The name is of French/Norman origin and likely related to the other families who held lands throughout the country, such as that of Walter Gervais. In the 1370s the family began to gift lands in Ropley to the founding of Winchester College by William of Wykeham. William Gervas of Ropley, mentioned in Winchester College documents in 1256, is the first recorded member of the Gervais family in Ropley, although their presence in the village possibly went back earlier. The last known mention of the family in regard to the rentals of the land of Roger Gervays was in 1450. At this point the family had sold most of their lands to Winchester College.

===Post Medieval===

====Inclosure act====

The commons and common fields of Ropley, estimated at 500 acres, were enclosed by the (8 Ann. c. &quot;16&quot; ) in what was the first private act of Parliament of its kind in England. The bill was led by the Bishop of Winchester, Jonathan Trelawny, in an effort to restore his family finances, and by the College of Winchester. The enclosure was strongly contested by petition by many of the commoners, who claimed that the bishop and his three appointed commissioners were stealing their commons rights. Parliament declined to intervene. Serious and bloody repercussions followed affecting neighbouring parishes and later enclosures across the country.

===Historic buildings===

There are numerous old buildings in the village:

== St Peter&#x27;s Parish Church==
St Peter&#x27;s Parish Church is one of the most ancient churches in the area, with the oldest parts dating to the 1000s. The church also bears some architectural similarities to St Peter&#x27;s ad Vincula in nearby Colemore, now redundant, albeit larger. Throughout the medieval period the church saw several modifications, including extension and addition of a south chapel in the late 1200s.

The church here was considered a chapel until Ropley became a separate parish from Bishop&#x27;s Sutton. Hence, in one of the first records mentioning from around 1270, the church in Ropley is known as the &quot;Cappella de Roppele&quot;, meaning the &quot;chapel of Ropley&quot; in Latin.

In the &quot;Victoria County History&quot; entry for Ropley the bell inscriptions of Ropley&#x27;s bells are preserved:

&quot;There are five bells, the ring having been recast from four old bells into five by Samuel Knight in 1701. The tenor bears the inscription:
&quot;John Gilberd did contrive to cast from four this peale of fife (five).&quot;

John Gilberd was evidently the foreman in charge of the work. The fourth bell was recast by Robert Catlin in 1749, and the third is now cracked. The bell frame was made new at the general recasting, and is inscribed IG TO 1701&quot;.

Interestingly, through works and excavations done within the church itself, &quot;workmen found in the South Transept the remains of a furnace and pieces of old bell metal&quot;, suggesting the bells were recast directly in the church.

The vicar of Ropley from 1796 to 1811 was the Reverend William Howley (who succeeded his father, also William Howley, in the post). Howley is perhaps Ropley&#x27;s most famous resident, and went on to serve as a canon of Christ Church, Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford University, Bishop of London (1813–1828), and Archbishop of Canterbury (1828–1848), in which capacity he crowned two British monarchs.

By the late 1800s the church &quot;had fallen into such a state of dilapidation as to be actually insecure&quot;, leading to a restoration that was decided upon in 1891. However, planning did not begin until 1892, due to the appointment and settling-in of the new vicar, Rev. W. H. Leak. The new reverend was able to collect around £2,300 by 1896, about £244,000 in today&#x27;s money, which was spent primarily on repairing the roof, re-paving the floor with pine blocks and concrete, and removing the old gallery.

Its World War I memorial lists 40 people who died, whilst the World War II tablet lists a further 10 people.

On the morning of 19 June 2014 the Grade-II listed church was severely damaged by a major electrical fire. This gutted the building and destroyed the roof. However, plans were put forward to repair the building, and after eight years, on 26 August 2022, the church was reopened to the public. 

==Hamlets==
Ropley contains many interesting and ancient hamlets that were part or currently are part of the historical area of Ropley Parish:

==Amenities==
===Education===
The village contains one primary school, Ropley CofE Primary School, founded in 1826 by the Reverend Samuel Maddock, who first built it on a previous site in Petersfield Road. William Faichen was the co-founder of the school, and became the first headmaster.

In 1869, the school burned down in a fire. It was rebuilt on the present day site at Church Street and reopened the same year. Since then, the school has operated continuously.

By the early 1900s it became clear that the population growth in Four Marks, then a hamlet within Ropley Parish, made necessary the construction of a new school there. Financed by Marianne Hagen, daughter of the wealthy politician Jacob Hagen, the Ropley School was opened in 1902. &quot;RS 1902&quot; can still be seen on the front of the main school building (see Four Marks School).

The school values its historic links with the community. Parts of the original Victorian traditional flint and brick buildings remain, and now form the hall and the school kitchen. The main teaching area consists of six modern classrooms with shared corridor working spaces. The most recent classroom was built in 2001 and is especially equipped for early years children.

The primary school is one of the feeder schools for Perins School, and both maintain high standards.

===Station===

Ropley railway station opened in 1865, and has operated continuously since that date, other than for four years from 1973 to 1977. Originally opened by the London and South Western Railway, services ended in 1973, but were restored by a preservation society four years later, as part of the Mid Hants Railway, running heritage services between Alton and New Alresford. There is a 100-year established garden topiary by the station house side. The locomotive shed and engineering works are located adjacent to the station, and tours may be booked. Trains operate from May to September each year, with additional Christmas and New Year special services.

===Ropley History Network and Archive===
Since 2021 a local history group known as the Ropley History Network and Archive, abbreviated as RHN&amp;A has been active in the village and its surrounding. The research group primarily focusses on the history and archaeology of the Ropley, in addition to some neighbouring parishes, like Four Marks, West Tisted and Farringdon. Their website, Ropley History hosts a large number of documents, maps, photographs and videos, the group also regularly hold talks and open sessions where artefacts and documents are digitised, discussed and presented.

===Village Shop===
The village has a small shop, formerly stables dating to the 19th century. It also doubles as a post office which replaced the older one which was opened in 1851 when the population was 818. In 1870, the population was 796.

==Governance==
Ropley is part of the Alton Rural county ward, and returns one county councillor to Hampshire County Council.

Ropley is part of the Ropley and Tisted district ward, and returns one district councillor to East Hampshire District Council.

<text>Abdul Rahman (; died February 14, 2002) was the Aviation and Tourism minister of Afghanistan until his death on February 14, 2002.

He was murdered in what appeared to be a mob attack on his plane at Kabul International Airport by pilgrims angry that they had been unable to travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
Witnesses and officials said pilgrims beat the minister to death and tossed his body to the tarmac. However, President Hamid Karzai accused six senior government officials of the murder, saying that they were motivated by a long-standing feud.
Three were arrested and the others were being sought in Saudi Arabia. Karzai said five ministers, including the head of the intelligence ministry, General Abdullah Tawhedi; the technical deputy of the Ministry of Defense, General Qalander Beg, and a Supreme Court justice, Haji Halim and 15 other suspects had been linked to the assassination.

His widow is Frozan Fana, a medical doctor.
She was a candidate in the 2009 Afghan presidential election.

The news for his death in Japanese was later misunderstood as &quot;Afghan air sumo wrestling killed&quot;, instead of &quot;Afghan aviation minister beaten to death&quot;, which later became an internet meme on 2channel.

<doc id="653964" wikidata="Q1378298" url="?curid=653964" title="Ali Meshkini">
<text>Ali Akbar Feiz Aleni (; 2 December 1921 – 30 July 2007), better known as Ali Meshkini (علی مشکینی), was an Iranian cleric and politician.

==Life==
Meshkini was an Iranian Azerbaijani born in a village near Meshkin Shahr and the Sabalan mountain. He was born as &quot;Āli&quot;, but preferred the pronunciation &quot;Ali&quot; during his career. He succeeded Ayatollah Montazeri as chairman of the Iranian Assembly of Experts after the latter was ousted. The Assembly of Experts selects the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervises his activities.

Meshkini chaired the commission that drafted the amendment of 1989 to the 1979 constitution of Iran. Within the commission, he also chaired one of its four committees, the one tasked with drafting amendments that would strengthen the judiciary. As such, he was an influential force in changing the leadership of the judiciary from a triumvirate, the Supreme Judicial Council, to an individual in 1989.

He was the author of many books on Islamic jurisprudence and general issues of Islam. Mohammadi Reyshahri, Iran&#x27;s minister of intelligence from 1984 to 1989, was Meshkini&#x27;s son-in-law.

Meshkini was the chair of the Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom and also served as Friday prayer leader in Qom. Despite his old age and poor health, he became a candidate for re-election in 2006 Assembly of Experts elections.

==Death==
Meshkini died on 30 July 2007 at 16:30 local time, at Tehran Hospital, of respiratory and kidney failure.

==Quotes and political views==
Meshkini was known for his unyielding support of the likes of Ahmadinejad and the hardline politicians of Iran. He regarded the Iranian reformist movement &quot;as a complete waste of time&quot; and on several occasions called for the resignation of the likes of Mohammad Khatami.

After the election of Ahmadinejad, Meshkini spoke at a Friday prayer in Ardebil saying: &quot;As the Supreme Leader of The Assembly of Experts of the Islamic Republic of Iran, it gives me great pleasure to announce that Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is our new President. From this moment onwards, we will follow his words (religiously). Our people in Azerbaijan will follow him alongside the Persians in the same spirit of brotherhood that we have kept for decades ... as Shia&#x27;s&quot;.

After the Israel-Lebanon conflict, Meshkini has been quoted to say that &quot;victory of the Lebanese Hizbollah over the Zionist regime was a divine phenomenon.&quot;

Referring to US occupation of Iraq, Meshkini said: &quot;A bully has embarked on a military expedition and has attacked another bully in the midst of Islamic countries ... Look at what they have done and what they are doing under the pretext of freedom ... The mask of deception has been lifted from the face of Bush and Blair. It has become clear that they are both blood-sucking Hitlers.&quot;

<doc id="653966" wikidata="Q336699" url="?curid=653966" title="Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell">
<text>John Francis Stanley Russell, 2nd Earl Russell, known as Frank Russell (12 August 18653 March 1931), was a British nobleman, barrister and politician, the elder brother of the philosopher Bertrand Russell, and the grandson of John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, who was twice prime minister of Britain. The elder son of Viscount and Viscountess Amberley, Russell became well known for his marital woes, and was convicted of bigamy before the House of Lords in 1901, the last peer to be convicted of an offence in a trial by the Lords before that privilege of peerage was abolished in 1948.

Russell was raised by his paternal grandparents after his unconventional parents both died young. He was discontented living with his grandparents, but enjoyed four happy years at Winchester College. His academic education came to a sudden end when he was sent down from Balliol College, Oxford, probably because authorities there had suspicions concerning the nature of his relationship with the future poet Lionel Johnson, and he always bitterly resented his treatment by Oxford. After spending time in the United States, he married the first of his three wives, Mabel Edith Scott, in 1890. The two quickly separated, and the next several years saw acrimonious litigation in the courts, but the restrictive English laws of the time meant there was no divorce. Russell was elected to the London County Council in 1895, and served there until 1904. In 1899, he accompanied the woman who would become his second wife, Mollie Somerville, to Nevada, where each obtained a divorce, and they married, then returned to Britain to live as husband and wife. Russell was the first celebrity to get a Nevada divorce, but it was not recognised by English law, and in June 1901, he was arrested for bigamy. He pleaded guilty before the House of Lords, and served three months in Holloway, afterwards marrying Mollie according to English law. He gained a free pardon for the offence in 1911.

Beginning in 1902 Russell campaigned for divorce law reform, using his hereditary seat as a peer in the House of Lords to advocate this, but had little success. He was also a campaigner for motorists&#x27; rights, often taking briefs to defend them after being called to the bar in 1905, and at one time had the registration number plate A 1. His second marriage ended after he fell in love with the novelist Elizabeth von Arnim in 1914, and he married von Arnim in 1916. The couple soon separated, though they did not divorce, and Elizabeth caricatured him in her novel &quot;Vera&quot;, to his anger. Frank Russell aided his brother Bertrand when he was imprisoned for anti-war activities in 1918. Increasingly aligned with the Labour Party, Russell was given junior office in the second MacDonald government in 1929, but his ministerial career was cut short by his death in 1931. Despite his achievements, Frank Russell is obscure compared to his brother and grandfather, and his marital difficulties led to his being dubbed the &quot;Wicked Earl&quot;.

==Early life==
John Francis Stanley Russell was born on 12 August 1865 at Alderley Park in Cheshire. He was the first child of the politician Viscount Amberley and suffragist Viscountess Amberley. His paternal grandfather, the Earl Russell, twice served as prime minister and had been an architect of the Reform Act 1832. His mother&#x27;s parents were the politician Lord Stanley and education campaigner Lady Stanley, and Alderley Park was their seat. Frank Russell thus descended from two prominent Whig families.

Unconventional for their time, the Amberleys believed in birth control, feminism, political reforms then considered radical (including votes for women and the working classes) and free love, and lived according to their ideals. For example, feeling it unfair that Douglas Spalding, the tutor of their son Frank, should remain celibate, the viscountess invited Spalding to share her bed, with the approval of her husband. The Amberleys had two children after Frank, Rachel (born 1868) and Bertrand (born 1872). The family lived at Rodborough house (near Stroud), which belonged to the viscount&#x27;s father, and then at Ravenscroft Hall, near Trellech, where Frank was allowed to do much as he pleased, including roaming the countryside. His parents had lost religious faith and Frank was not called upon to attend church. By age eight, he had read, for pleasure, the complete works of Sir Walter Scott, and began a lifelong love of science and engineering by attending the Royal Society&#x27;s lectures for children.
In December 1873, the family journeyed to Italy; during the return the following May, Frank came down with diphtheria. He was nursed by his mother, and recovered, but in June both she and Rachel fell ill with the disease. The viscountess died on 28 June and her daughter five days later, dealing the viscount a blow from which he never really recovered. He died on 9 January 1876 from pneumonia. The viscount&#x27;s will nominated T. J. Sanderson, a friend from his university days, and Spalding as co-guardians of Frank and Bertrand. The earl and his wife, Lady Russell, might have accepted Sanderson, even though he was (like Spalding) an atheist, but Spalding was of a lower social class and was not acceptable, especially once they had the opportunity to read the Amberleys&#x27; surviving papers and learnt the nature of his relationship with the viscountess. Lord and Lady Russell brought suit in the Court of Chancery, and Sanderson and Spalding chose not to fight the suit. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the custody of their paternal grandparents, with two of the Russells&#x27; adult children, Rollo and Agatha, also co-guardians.

This took Frank from what he later called the &quot;free air of Ravenscroft&quot; where he could wander as he wished, to his grandparents&#x27; home at Pembroke House, where he was closely supervised and confined to the grounds. He found the atmosphere stiflingno subject considered vulgar could be mentioned, and he was required to go to church and have religious education. The earl was by then past 80, two decades older than his wife, and spent many of his waking hours reading: the house was dominated by Lady Russell, who employed a strict moral code in raising the boys. Frank was not allowed much time alone with Bertrand, as he was believed a bad influence on his younger brother, and Frank Russell wrote of Bertrand, &quot;Till he went to Cambridge he was an unendurable little prig.&quot; Annabel Huth Jackson, a friend of both boys, deemed Pembroke House, &quot;an unsuitable place... for children to be brought up in.&quot; George Bernard Shaw, a half-century later, wrote to Frank of his incredulity that the boy had not murdered his Uncle Rollo and burned the place down.

==Education==
Frank was sent to Cheam as a boarder in 1876. He was happier at school than he had been at Pembroke Lodge. In his memoirs he remembered his indignation at being addressed by his father&#x27;s courtesy title, Viscount Amberley, which was now his as heir apparent to the earldom. He was still at Cheam when in 1878, his grandfather died, making Frank the 2nd Earl Russell.

Frank then attended Winchester College, from 1879 to 1883. Winchester became his spiritual home, and he expressed his reverence for the school in his autobiography. George Santayana, who would be a long-time friend of Frank Russell, described Winchester as &quot;the only place he loved and the only place he was loved&quot;. Frank briefly became pious while at Winchester, going so far as to be confirmed by the Bishop of Winchester in November 1880. The orphaned earl was taken under the wing of his housemaster, the Revd George Richardson, and his wife Sarah. It was Sarah Richardson that Santayana was thinking of in making his statement; she later defended Frank Russell as his marital problems filled the daily papers, and he was devastated by her death in 1909. At Winchester, Frank spent four of his happiest years and acquired many of the friends he would have in adult life. From about the time Frank began at Winchester, Frank and Bertrand began to spend time with their maternal grandmother, Lady Stanley, whom they came to like greatly as far less priggish than Lady Russell. Frank came to find Lady Stanley&#x27;s London residence at 40Dover Street a refuge from Pembroke House.

It was at Winchester that he befriended the future poet and critic Lionel Johnson, whom he would describe as &quot;the greatest influence of my life at Winchester&quot;. They were friends in Russell&#x27;s final term at Winchester, and Johnson visited Pembroke House, but the friendship did not truly blossom until Russell went up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1883. The pair wrote long, earnest letters to each other in which they explored spiritual matters and questions of sin and morality. In 1919 Russell anonymously published Johnson&#x27;s side of the correspondence as &quot;Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson&quot;.
At Balliol, Russell read classics. The scholar of classical Greek literature Benjamin Jowett was then Master of Balliol and also Vice-Chancellor of Oxford. Russell found the university stimulating, welcoming the &quot;untrammelled and unfettered discussions on everything in heaven and earth&quot;. He wrote to Johnson at Winchester, and after the correspondence was forbidden by Johnson&#x27;s father, routed his letters through fellow undergraduate Charles Sayle. Russell joined university clubs and other groups, and made satisfactory academic progress through much of his first two years, but his Oxford career was dramatically cut short when in May 1885, as Russell related it in his memoirs, he was sent down by Jowett for supposedly writing a &quot;scandalous&quot; letter to another male undergraduate. Russell denied the charges but was refused a formal inquiry. Incensed at having been falsely accused, he lost his temper with Jowett, telling him he was no gentleman, and left the college. Even after a year, Jowett refused Russell re-admission to Balliol, and refused the necessary recommendation to allow Russell to enter a Cambridge college.

The veracity of Russell&#x27;s account of his sending-down is open to question; Santayana deemed it a fabrication, based on what Russell had privately told him, but at the core of it was the nature of Russell&#x27;s relationship with Johnson. In April 1885, Johnson, who had recently turned 18 but appeared younger, stayed overnight in Russell&#x27;s rooms after missing the last train to London, and, according to Santayana, the authorities had seen the two together and declared Johnson too young to be Russell&#x27;s &quot;natural friend&quot;. Nevertheless, Santayana wrote that the relations between Russell and Johnson had not been &quot;in the least erotic or even playful&quot;. In July 1885, two months after Russell was sent down, Johnson&#x27;s father enquired of Jowett whether Russell was a suitable companion for Lionel, and was told he was not, and that further acquaintance between the two should be forbidden. Russell and Jowett reconciled to some extent, and the master was present at the earl&#x27;s first wedding in 1890. Russell, though, missed Jowett&#x27;s funeral in 1893, alleging rheumatism, and remained bitter about the end of his Oxford career for the rest of his life. Santayana stated that any &quot;unnatural desires&quot; on Russell&#x27;s part did not last, given that he turned out &quot;a perfectly normal pronounced polygamous male&quot;.

==Early adulthood==

After his sending-down from Oxford, Russell took a year&#x27;s leasehold on a small house in the village of Hampton, to which his guardians (he was not yet 21 years old, the age of majority at the time) reluctantly consented on condition a tutor of their choice live with him. Although the monotony of life in the London suburbs was varied by guests such as Oscar Wilde, Russell was resentful at how he had been treated at Oxford and in October 1885, took ship for the United States. He was generally impressed with America, but disliked New York City. On his trip, he first met Santayana, then an undergraduate at Harvard College; he was the first Englishman Santayana had ever met. Russell also met Walt Whitman on his trip across America and back, and visited the president, Grover Cleveland at the White House.

Russell attained his majority in August 1886, and came into his inheritance, allowing him to live on a grander scale. He was not idle, involving himself with an electrical contracting company, a field he had experimented in since his boyhood. This was the first of many commercial enterprises in which he would participate. Like Russell&#x27;s commercial career as a whole, it had mixed success, ceasing to trade within three years. An expensive lifestyle and fees from the many court actions he was involved in would lead him to describe himself as bankrupt by 1921, and when Frank died ten years later, Bertrand said he had inherited a title from his brother but little else.

==First marriage==
Although Russell was not wealthy by the standards of British nobility, what he did have, including his title, was enough to make him the target of parents seeking suitable matches for their daughters. Among these were Maria Selina (Lina) Elizabeth, Lady Scott, who sought a suitable match for her daughter, Mabel Edith Scott, and called on Russell in 1889. Santayana recalled that Russell was at first more interested in Selina Scott, a divorcée, than her daughter and theorised that the fact that Russell&#x27;s mother died when he was a child allowed Lady Scott to overwhelm Russell and persuade him that the way to perpetuate their friendship was for him to marry her daughter.

Frank and Mabel Russell married on 6 February 1890. Three months later, the two separated, Mabel alleging physical and mental cruelty. Santayana later wrote, &quot;Russell as a husband, Russell in the domestic sphere, was simply impossible: excessively virtuous and incredibly tyrannical. He didn&#x27;t allow her enough money or enough liberty. He was punctilious and unforgiving about hours, about truth-telling, about debts. He objected to her friends, her clothes, and borrowed jewels. Moreover, in their intimate relations he was exacting and annoying. She soon hated and feared him.&quot;

Late in 1890, Mabel sued unsuccessfully to judicially separate from him, accusing him in the process of &quot;immoral behaviour&quot; with another university friend, Herbert Roberts, head mathematics tutor at Bath College. The allegations of the trial filled the newspapers. and a jury found in Frank Russell&#x27;s favour. At the time, the only valid ground for divorce was adultery, although a woman alleging it would also have to show some other offence, such as desertion. With the approval of their families, Frank and Mabel Russell continued to live apart, a tacitly agreed relationship that meant Mabel was unlikely to be able to show desertion. Although there were fitful efforts at reconciliation thereafter, the parties remained apart. In 1892, Russell opened his own firm of electrical engineers, Russell &amp; Co. He began to be seen more in the House of Lords, in September 1893 being one of forty peers who supported the unsuccessful Irish Home Rule bill. Despite the lull in the Russell matrimonial litigation, detectives were active for both sides, hoping to find evidence of adultery which would allow their employer advantage in the courts. By 1894, Frank Russell, as he told his brother Bertrand, was three years into an affair with Mary Morris, a clerk at his electrical works.

Having failed to convince the jury, Mabel subsequently attempted to obtain a separation by indirect means, suing for restitution of conjugal rights in 1894. Under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1884, failure to comply with an order of restitution of conjugal rights served to establish desertion, which gave the other spouse the right to an immediate decree of judicial separation, and, if coupled with the husband&#x27;s adultery, allowed the wife to obtain a divorce. Such an action also allowed a petitioning wife to seek an allowance. In general, at the time in England, divorces were available only when the petitioning spouse had not offended against the marriage and the other spouse had. The earl countersued on the ground that her accusations since 1891 amounted to legal cruelty. A jury found for Frank Russell in both cases in 1895, but Mabel appealed and the verdict was overturned in the Court of Appeal. The case went all the way to the House of Lords, and the Law Lords affirmed the appeals court decision. This denied them both satisfaction, binding the definition of legal cruelty to physical violence and making &quot;Russell v. Russell&quot; a case of legal significance for the next seventy years, until divorce law reform eliminated cruelty as a statutory ground for divorce. Another trial took place in 1897 after Lady Scott published accusations against Russell; she was convicted of criminal libel and sentenced to eight months in prison, but Russell was hissed at by the crowds surrounding the Old Bailey after the sentencing, and called the &quot;Wicked Earl&quot;.

The Local Government Act 1894 created district and parish councils. In December of that year Russell successfully stood for Cookham Parish Council, and was made chairman, and &quot;ex officio&quot; a guardian of the poor. He worked to change outdated practices in the workhouse, and to see that roads and rights of way were maintained. In February 1895, he was elected to London County Council (LCC) for Newington West as a Progressive. He aligned himself with the left, joining the Reform Club in 1894, a bastion of Liberalism. He stood unsuccessfully for Hammersmith at the next election, in March 1898, but was made an alderman, continuing him on the LCC, where he remained through 1904.

==Nevada divorce==
Russell became infatuated with Marion (known as Mollie) Somerville, who was at that time married to George Somerville, with whom Russell had become friendly during the campaign in Hammersmith. The twice-married daughter of a master shoemaker from Ireland, Mollie Somerville had three children and was secretary of the Hammersmith Women&#x27;s Liberal Association. She campaigned for Russell; the two became close and were seen together at several events. When she fell ill early in 1899, Russell let her use one of his residences, and the two went away together, travelling via France to America. Russell planned to use laxer American divorce laws to end his marriage to Mabel Russell.

Russell and Mollie Somerville journeyed to Chicago, but learned that local laws had recently been tightened, and required a year&#x27;s residence, with other restrictive provisions. North Dakota and Arizona Territory were also considered, and in the latter case visited, but also required living there a year. Nevada, with only a six-month requirement, was more practical. They settled in Glenbrook, on Lake Tahoe, for the winter of 1899–1900. On 14 April 1900 both Russell and Somerville were granted divorces. Their marriage ceremony in Reno before Judge Benjamin Franklin Curler took place on 15 April. They honeymooned on the way to America&#x27;s East Coast, including at Denver&#x27;s Brown Palace Hotel, where Russell told a reporter that a charge of bigamy would never stick. The couple returned to Britain the following month.

Russell knew such a divorce was invalid under English law, which refused to recognise foreign divorces obtained by British subjects; his intent was to allow Mabel Russell to obtain a divorce on the grounds of bigamy following adultery, which would also free him to marry again: he deposited £5,000 that would go to her upon a divorce to ensure her cooperation.

Beginning when Russell wired news of his Nevada marriage to appear as a notice in &quot;The Times&quot;, there was considerable press interest on both sides of the Atlantic in what had occurred. Both Mabel Russell and George Somerville filed for divorce, and each gained them uncontested, subject to the usual waiting period before the decrees became absolute. Russell, on his return, took his seat on the LCC as if nothing had occurred. There was, initially, no other official reaction, society accepted them as a married couple, and Mollie appeared on the 1901 census as &quot;Mollie Russell&quot;.

==Trial before the Lords==
Russell was arrested on a charge of bigamy as he stepped from a train at Waterloo Station on 17 June 1901. Why an action was brought for this rarely prosecuted crime is uncertain. Russell believed that he was prosecuted when, as he related, another nobleman who had acted similarly but was a favourite at Court was not, because he was &quot;an unbeliever and a radical&quot;. The Russell family always believed that the earl was prosecuted at the behest of the new king, Edward VII, who had a chequered past and several mistresses while on the throne, to boost his own reputation for morality.

Russell was bailed, and following a hearing at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court on 22 June, he was indicted for bigamy by a grand jury and committed for trial. Until the privilege was abolished in 1948, peers and peeresses indicted for treason or felony were tried before the House of Lords, a majority vote deciding the matter. Russell could not have waived trial there had he wanted to, and the verdict of the House of Lords could not be appealed. Such trials were rare: Russell&#x27;s trial was the first since that of Lord Cardigan, who was acquitted on a charge of duelling in 1841, the previous trial having been in 1776, and only one trial, resulting in the acquittal of Lord de Clifford for manslaughter in 1935, followed before the abolition.
Russell&#x27;s trial before the House of Lords took place in the Royal Gallery of the Houses of Parliament on 18 July 1901, with some two hundred peers present, including Lord Salisbury, the prime minister. The lords spiritual who were among Russell&#x27;s judges were William Maclagan, the Archbishop of York and Randall Davidson, the Bishop of Winchester (later Archbishop of Canterbury). Lord Halsbury, the lord chancellor, presided under the king&#x27;s commission as lord high steward. Also present were Mollie Russell, Judge Curler, and the English clergyman who had performed Russell&#x27;s first marriage. The assembled peers and judges in their robes were deemed &quot;most picturesque&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which described a &quot;magnificent blaze of color&quot; from the robes of the assembled peers and judges. All the Lords of Appeal were present to advise the peers on any legal questions that arose, as were eleven other judges. This required the suspension of the courts over which they would have presided that day, and some newspapers questioned the cost of the spectacle, which included the expense of bringing over Curler from Nevada and housing him for two months.

When Russell&#x27;s trial began on 18 July, he was called upon to plead guilty or not guilty, but his counsel interposed, and argued that because the wedding had taken place in America, Russell had not violated the bigamy statute. Lord Halsbury dismissed the point without even requiring the prosecution to respond. Russell then pleaded guilty, and made a statement defending his conduct and stating that no one had been injured thereby, and the lords retired to consider their verdict. The House of Lords had the power to disqualify Russell from sitting there in future unless pardoned, but it did not. On the recommendation of Lord Halsbury, Russell was sentenced to three months at Holloway Prison. He wrote in his memoirs that the privilege of peers cost him dearly, as he probably would have been sentenced to a token day in prison at the Old Bailey had he been a commoner. Instead, a great sum of money and considerable effort had been expended to provide him with a trial before the Lords, &quot;and it was necessary that the sentence should bear some relation to the fuss made about it.&quot; In anticipation of his arrival, a room for favoured prisoners, previously occupied by the journalist W. T. Stead and by some of the Jameson raiders, had been prepared for him, where he could have his own food and wine.
Russell spent part of his time in prison peppering the home secretary, Charles Ritchie, with petitions for his early release (which he did not gain) and for better conditions and more privileges (which, mostly, he received). He read through the works of Shakespeare, twice, and wrote his first book, &quot;Lay Sermons&quot;, treating religious and ethical questions from his perspective as an agnostic. His friend, Santayana, was unimpressed with the book, describing it as &quot;the only regrettable consequence&quot; of Russell&#x27;s incarceration. He was released on 17 October 1901, eleven days before his divorce by Mabel Russell became absolute (George Somerville&#x27;s divorce of Mollie had become absolute on 24 June). Frank Russell married Mollie according to English law on 31 October 1901.

Frank Russell persisted in his view that he had done nothing wrong. In 1911 he approached the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, asking for a free pardon, and when asked why he deserved it, told Asquith, &quot;Well, the official reason is that I have been a good citizen, for ten years since the offence, and that my conduct is free from any reproach; but if you ask me for the real reason I should say because the conviction was a piece of hypocritical tosh.&quot; A free pardon was duly issued by the home secretary, Winston Churchill.

==Second marriage==
Released from prison, Russell attempted to use his place in the House of Lords to reform the law of divorce. In 1902 he introduced legislation to allow divorce based on cruelty, lunacy, three years separation, or one year if both parties consented. Their lordships, led by Lord Halsbury, immediately voted down the bill, rather than (as was usual with bills that were not to be passed) postponing consideration of it. Russell tried again in 1903, with an identical outcome. Attempts in 1905 and 1908 were treated more gently by the Lords, which postponed consideration rather than rejecting them outright. Russell wrote of his proposals in his second book, &quot;Divorce&quot; (1912), and a royal commission that year recommended reforms, which were in fact slow in coming: it was not until after the First World War that divorce came within reach of those not wealthy, by allowing petitions to be heard at local assizes rather than in London, and no-fault divorce was not enacted until 1969.

Both because he had become interested in law and because he was in need of income, in 1899 Russell was admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn as a student for the Bar. His studies were interrupted by his time in Nevada and in Holloway, but no action was taken against him for his conviction of felony. He was called to the Bar in 1905, and practised for about five years.

Russell was an early motorist and an active member of the RAC (then the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). He was an outspoken defender of motorists&#x27; rights. He is famed for having the registration A 1. This is frequently reported as being the first number plate issued in Britain, but was most likely notit was, however, the first registration issued by the London County Council (LCC), in 1903. Russell was still a member of the LCC, and awarded the registration to himself. The number plate made him a target for the police, and after five speeding tickets and threats to suspend his licence from magistrates, he sold car and plate in 1906. He continued working for motorists&#x27; rights as a barrister, taking large numbers of briefs for motoring offences.

The marriage with Mollie was generally a success in its early years; according to Russell&#x27;s biographer, Ruth Derham, she &quot;genuinely loved him, understood that he must be master in his own house... her outside interests provided them both with a degree of independence.&quot; High among these was women&#x27;s suffrage: both spouses spoke at public meetings in favour of votes for women, and Mollie challenged Asquith to provide more than just a &quot;vague promise&quot; of the vote. Russell disapproved of militant suffragists such as Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, but conceded that their tactics were effective.

==Third marriage; First World War years==
In 1909 Russell met the woman who would become his third wife, the novelist Elizabeth von Arnim ( Mary Annette Beauchamp), widow of Count Henning August von Arnim-Schlagenthin, by whom she had five children. The widowed von Arnim had an affair with H. G. Wells, and ended her relationship with Wells after learning that he had another lover. At the same time, Frank and Mollie Russell had quarrelled and were growing apart, and he and Elizabeth von Arnim moved in the same literary circles. They fell in love in a visit he paid her, without Mollie, over the New Year of 1914. Mollie Russell petitioned for restoration of conjugal rights but once convinced Frank would not return, accepted an allowance for life, which Bertrand continued to pay after Frank&#x27;s death in 1931, permitting her to live a life of leisure. In exchange, she sued for divorce on the grounds of desertion and adultery, and the suit was not contested.

Frank and Elizabeth Russell married on 11 February 1916. The marriage failed quickly and acrimoniously, and she fled for America after only six months of marriage, Frank&#x27;s temper being a major factor. Like each of Frank Russell&#x27;s marriages, there were no children born of it. It has been suggested that the earl was addicted to cocaine, though Derham found this to be unlikely and contended that the addiction which helped destroy the marriage was Frank&#x27;s love of gambling at bridge. Two weeks before his death in 1931 Frank Russell wrote to Santayana that he had received two great shocks in his life, when Jowett sent him down from Oxford, and &quot;when Elizabeth left me I went completely dead and have never come alive again.&quot; An attempted reconciliation failed in 1919. They never divorced. Von Arnim famously caricatured Russell in her 1921 novel &quot;Vera&quot;, a depiction that greatly angered him, and when Elizabeth heard of her husband&#x27;s death in 1931 she said she was &quot;never happier in her life&quot;.

Russell had continued to take liberal stances in the House of Lords, strongly supporting the Parliament Act 1911, which diminished its powers, and in December 1912 joined the Fabian Society, the first peer to do so. Nevertheless, he did not align himself with the fledgling Labour Party, and in January 1913, decried the &quot;dangerous immunity&quot; of trade unions. Russell supported British involvement in the First World War once it started, but sympathised with his brother Bertrand&#x27;s anti-war views. Both opposed conscription, and Frank was one of only two peers to speak in opposition in the Lords when Asquith brought in conscription in 1916.

Bertrand&#x27;s anti-war activities were considerable, despite Frank urging caution on him; he was successfully prosecuted under the Defence of the Realm Act, banned from areas of the country, sacked from his position as lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, and denied a passport to go to America to take up a position at Harvard. By late 1917, though, Bertrand had become disillusioned with his cause and Frank met with General George Cockerill of the War Office, resulting in agreement within the government on 17 January 1918 that the banning order should be lifted. The same day, though, Bertrand published an article, &quot;The German Peace Offer&quot; in &quot;The Tribunal&quot;, causing the government to rescind the agreement, and in February he was prosecuted and sentenced to six months in prison, a sentence he began in May after an appeal failed. He was allowed, though, to serve his sentence at Brixton Prison, with greater privileges than the magistrate would have given him. In a 1959 BBC interview Bertrand attributed this to Frank&#x27;s influence over the home secretary, Sir George Cave, though Bertrand&#x27;s biographer, Ray Monk, believed that Bertrand was confusing the efforts to get him these privileges with Frank&#x27;s later efforts to secure a remission, which bore fruit when Bertrand was released six weeks early. While Bertrand was in prison, Frank visited him, and with Bertrand limited to one outgoing letter per week, received lengthy letters from his brother containing messages to be given to other people.

==Labour politician and death (1921–1931)==
Elizabeth&#x27;s publication of &quot;Vera&quot; led to threats from Russell&#x27;s solicitor, but only served to increase interest in the book. Bertrand and Santayana considered the depiction cruel but Santayana admitted it was accurate in detail. The earl carried a copy of it around with him, and attempted to refute individual passages from it to those willing to listen. Russell&#x27;s more substantial response was to write his memoirs, &quot;My Life and Adventures&quot;, published in 1923, in which Elizabeth is never mentioned. The book was well received; most reviewers deemed it entertaining.
From the early 1920s Russell was more commonly seen in the House of Lords. He fully embraced the Labour Party when it took office for the first time under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. He was given no office in that short-lived government, possibly because of his past marital problems. By the time Labour was in government again, in 1929, Russell had proved his worth to the Labour Party both in debatethere were then very few Labour peersand through service in committee and on royal commissions. Russell hoped to be Lord President of the Council or Leader of the House of Lords, but these posts went to Lord Parmoor. Russell was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Herbert Morrison, a post for which his considerable experience with automobiles qualified him.

Russell&#x27;s main accomplishment in the Transport position was steering the Road Traffic Act 1930 through the House of Lords. This abolished the speed limit that had been in place for motor cars since 1893, but also required compulsory insurance and set a minimum driving age, as well as legislating against dangerous driving. Having served on the Royal Commission on Lunacy, Russell introduced what became the Mental Treatment Act 1930, allowing voluntary admission to psychiatric facilities and permitting a local authority to establish mental health outpatient clinics.

Russell was promoted to Under-Secretary of State for India under William Wedgwood Benn. He began his tenure by stating that Indian independence was &quot;at this moment impossible&quot;, something which although quickly retracted, Nehru concluded was the true attitude of the British government. He worked hard to overcome the gaffe, and was a delegate to the First Round Table Conference (1930–1931). As one of Labour&#x27;s few representatives in the Lords, he was often called upon to steer legislation having nothing to do with his portfolio. In February 1931, he took a holiday on the Riviera, where he suffered from influenza. Still recovering from this, he died at his hotel in Marseilles on 3 March 1931, the day before he was supposed to depart for home. He was cremated there, and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of his former home, Telegraph House.

The prime minister, MacDonald, stated, &quot;He was one of the most charming men I have ever met and behind his charm of manner was a really very great intelligence. He was a most valuable colleague both in making preparations for the round-table conference and in helping us to study and master the problems involved, and then in making the conference a success.&quot; Benn regretted Russell&#x27;s death &quot;not only because it deprives the India office of a distinguished political figure but because of the personal loss of a brilliant, kindly friend&quot;.

==Assessment==
Russell stated of himself:
Annabel Jackson remembered Russell as a child as Bertrand&#x27;s &quot;beautiful and gifted elder brother&quot;. Santayana wrote that while Lionel Johnson could be judged by his poems, &quot;poor Russell had only his ruins to display and to be judged by most unjustly, ruins of passions that had hounded him through life like a series of nightmares, and had made the gossips call him &#x27;The Wicked Earl&#x27;.&quot; To Derham, Russell &quot;was not a evil man. Neither by modern standards was he &#x27;wicked&#x27;. Throughout his life, his strong identification with his youthful self, misunderstood, persecuted, and wronged, led him to seek reforms that benefited many an underdog, but also made him &#x27;suspect the satisfied&#x27;, &#x27;distrust the majority&#x27;, impatient with acquaintance and unsuccessful in love.&quot; Ann Holmes, in her chapter on the Russell divorce cases, stated that in late Victorian England, &quot;marital fidelity was not as important as the appearance of a stable marriage and happy home; scandal was more shameful than adultery. It was a rule painfully learned by the second Earl Russell and his wife... Russell was a martyr in that he chose to defend himself publicly when he could have addressed his marital problems in private. At the very least, he could have agreed to negotiate a monetary settlement... He and his family paid a high price for his stubborn refusal to relent.&quot;

The divorce suits between Frank and Mabel Russell had historic significance. Jack Harpster in his article on Russell&#x27;s Nevada divorce, noted, &quot;John Francis Stanley Russell&#x27;s personal problems found expression in political activism, specifically in his effort to change England&#x27;s outdated divorce statutes. Although he saw no progress during his lifetime...&quot; Gail Savage, in her journal article on Russell&#x27;s divorce law advocacy, stated, &quot;Frank Russell&#x27;s vulnerability to the charms of a pretty widow and her pretty daughter had devastating consequences for his personal life. But the trajectory of Frank Russell&#x27;s personal misfortunes and the impetus of his personality intersected a larger-scale social and cultural dynamic that involved a refiguring of the ways in which we understand gender relations and marriage.&quot; The House of Lords&#x27; decision in &quot;Russell v. Russell&quot; remained a leading case in divorce law for decades, establishing several legal precedents. The first celebrity to get a Nevada divorce, Russell&#x27;s efforts there first drew attention to that state as a place where one could get an easier divorce than at home, though the divorce of Laura and William E. Corey (1906) and the establishment of an office in Nevada (1907) and subsequent promotion of the state by the New York lawyer, William H. Schnitzer, were greater factors in making Nevada a centre for divorces.

<doc id="653976" wikidata="Q3202503" url="?curid=653976" title="Limacina">
<text>Limacina is a genus of swimming predatory sea snails commonly known as sea butterflies in the family Limacinidae. This genus contains some of the world&#x27;s most abundant gastropod species.

Etymological meaning of the generic name &quot;Limacina&quot; is &quot;snail-like&quot;.

As pelagic marine gastropods, &quot;Limacina&quot; swim by flapping their parapodia, inspiring the common name sea butterflies.

Sea butterflies are part of the clade Thecosomata. Sea angels, similar to &quot;Limacina&quot;, are in the order Gymnosomata. Both of these orders are still referred to as &quot;pteropods&quot;. Sea butterflies of the order Thecosomata have a shell, while sea angels in the order Gymnosomata do not.

==Shell description==
The shells of &quot;Limacina&quot; are well developed, sinistrally coiled, turret-like, and include an operculum. Shell size and thickness vary within the genus. At high latitudes, the diameter of the shell does not exceed 15 mm. At lower latitudes, the diameter varies from 1 to 3 mm.

==Description of the soft parts==
Two large winglike parapodia, derived from foot tissue, propel these invertebrates through the water column to overcome negative buoyancy due to the animal&#x27;s shell. As diel vertical migrators, &quot;Limacina&quot; inhabit deeper waters during the day and travel to the surface at night to feed.

==Life habits==
Feeding habits of &quot;Limacina&quot; are characterized by actively feeding on planktonic organisms such as bacteria, small crustaceans, gastropod larvae, dinoflagellates and diatoms. These prey items become entangled in a mucosal web (up to 5 cm wide) excreted by the animal that is, in turn, eaten along with the prey items. This net also provides positive buoyancy. Ciliated posterior footlobes and lateral footlobes move food collected by the mucosal web into the mouth.

Large aggregations of &quot;Limacina&quot; migrating to the surface of the water attract predators such as &quot;Clione&quot; (family Clionidae, suborder Gymnosomata), baleen whales, various species of salmonids, herring, and seabirds.

<doc id="653994" wikidata="Q317767" url="?curid=653994" title="Abdullah Abdul Kadir">
<text>Abdullah bin Abdul al Kadir (1796–1854) ( &#x27;) also known asMunshi Abdullah, was a Malayan writer. He was a famous Malacca-born munshi of Singapore and died in Jeddah, a part of the Ottoman Empire.

Munshi Abdullah followed his father&#x27;s career path as a translator and teacher of colonial officials in the Malay Archipelago, mainly the British and the Dutch. Munshi Abdullah has been popularly regarded as among the most cultured Malays who ever wrote, one of the greatest innovators in Malay letters and the father of modern Malay literature.

== Life ==
Munshi Abdullah was born in Kampung Pali (now renamed as Kampung Ketek) in Malacca City, from parents of Tamil and Yemeni descent. He was the youngest of five sons. All of his brothers died in infancy. He was sick most of the time and his mother took great care of him. As per the customary practices of the Malay community of that period, he was taken care of by various individuals as it was held that a child with poor immunity to diseases should be cared for by caretakers other than his or her biological parents. Munshi Abdullah was critical of the practice, as described in &quot;Hikayat Abdullah&quot;. He became a teacher or &quot;munshi&quot;, first by teaching Malay to the Indian soldiers of the Malacca Garrison. He then taught the Malay language to British and American missionaries and businessmen. He became a functionary in the Straits Settlements next. He became a scribe and copyist for Sir Stamford Raffles, followed by, in 1815, becoming translator of the Gospels and other text for the London Missionary Society. He also worked with the American Board of Missions.

Abdullah set sail for Mecca from Singapore in 1854 with the intention of completing the Hajj pilgrimage. He died of cholera shortly after his arrival in Mecca and before he could complete his pilgrimage, some time between May 8 and 18, 1854. He was 59 years old at the time of his death. The &quot;Kisah pelayaran Abdullah dari Singapura sampai ke Mekah&quot; (The story of Abdullah&#x27;s voyage from Singapore to Mecca), one of Abdullah&#x27;s lesser-known works, records his experiences on the journey to Mecca. There is some controversy over the exact time and location of his death, with some scholars arguing that he died in Jeddah in October 1854 at the age of 58, before reaching Mecca.

== Works ==
His writing career took off after a missionary, Alfred North, encouraged him to write an autobiography after reading Abdullah&#x27;s account of a voyage along the east coast of Malaya. His most important works are the &quot;Hikayat Abdullah&quot; (an autobiography), &quot;Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan&quot; (an account of his trip for the government to Kelantan), and &quot;Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Mekah&quot; (a narrative of his pilgrimage to Mecca 1854). His work was an inspiration to future generations of writers and marks an early stage in the transition from classical Malay literature to modern Malay literature.

&quot;Hikayat Abdullah&quot; was the major literary work of Munshi Abdullah. It was completed in 1843 and first published in 1849, making it one of the first Malay literary texts to be published commercially. Abdullah&#x27;s authorship was prominently displayed in this text and the contents were conveyed in simple, contemporary Malay. Unlike typical classical Malay literary works that contain fantasies and legendary stories, Abdullah&#x27;s work was realistic. The book remains a reliable and accurate reference on early Malay history to this day.

Although the condemnation may be exaggerated, Munshi Abdullah&#x27;s allegations were not without basis. He is regarded by many to be the first Malayan journalist, taking Malay literature out of its preoccupation with folk-stories and legends into accurate historical descriptions.

=== &quot;Kerajaan&quot; ===
Abdullah was known as an ardent critic of the Malay political system of &quot;Kerajaan&quot; (&quot;kingship&quot;). His work, &quot;Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan&quot; contained his advice to Malay rulers and comparisons he made between the British system of governing and that of Malay rulers.

Abdullah argued that the system of &quot;Kerajaan&quot; was detrimental to the Malay individual, as it was an impediment to the social improvement of the Malays. The Malay Sultan was deemed to be someone who was selfish, with no concern toward his subjects, to the extent they were treated like animals rather than humans. The idea of modernity and striving for excellence within the Malay community stemmed from his ideas and stinging criticisms of the ancient Malay polity of the &quot;Kerajaan&quot;. Under the &quot;Kerajaan&quot;, the Malays were deprived of education and hence they were easily oppressed. Without education, they did not have the ability to question the injustice meted out to them and could not take the initiative to institute changes to improve their lives.

Some of his writings show the criticism levelled at the &quot;Kerajaan&quot; system. In one instance, after meeting and then following Raffles from Malacca to the newly established Singapore, Abdullah witnessed and criticized the dealings of the ruler&#x27;s men, mentioning the lack of safety, such as daylight robberies, house robberies, stabbings and burning of houses. The Temenggong&#x27;s men went fully armed and started brawls with men from Malacca and only with the presence of resident William Farquhar was further bloodshed avoided. Abdullah also commented on the attitudes common among the &#x27;anak raja&#x27; during his 1837 visit to Pahang and Terengganu, mentioning their lack of education, opium addiction, gambling and cockfighting.

== Ethnicity ==
Munshi Abdullah was a great-grandson of a Hadhrami Arab trader, and also had Indian Tamil and to a smaller extent, Malay ancestry. Owing to his ethnic and religious background, the Malays would refer to him as a &quot;Jawi Peranakan&quot; or &quot;Jawi Pekan&quot;.

J.T. Thomson, a contemporary of Abdullah, described him thus: &quot;In physiognomy he was a Tamilian of southern Hindustan: slightly bent forward, spare, energetic, bronze in complexion, oval-faced, high-nosed, one eye squinting outwards a little. He dressed in the usual style of Malacca Tamils. Acheen &quot;seluar&quot;, check &quot;sarong&quot;, printed &quot;baju&quot;, square skull cap and sandals. He had the vigour and pride of the Arab, the perseverance and subtlety of the Hindoo - in language and national sympathy only was he a Malay.&quot;

==Legacy==
A statue of him was erected alongside several local Singaporean figures in Raffles&#x27; Landing near the Singapore River to commemorate the bicentennial establishing of modern Singapore in 2019.

===Places named after him===

<text>Batangas, officially the City of Batangas (), is a component city and capital of the province of Batangas, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 351,437 people.

Batangas City is classified as one of the fastest urbanizing cities of the Philippines, and is known as the &quot;Industrial Port City of Calabarzon&quot;. It is home to the Batangas International Port, one of the busiest passenger and container terminals in the Philippines. It also hosts one of the largest oil refineries in the country, three natural gas power plants, and several other major industries. In addition, the city also serves as the educational, industrial and the transportation center of the province.

Batangas City is one of the proposed metropolitan area in the Philippines. Metro Batangas is proposed to include the component city of Batangas, as well as the towns of Alitagtag, Bauan, Ibaan, Lobo, Mabini, Rosario, San Juan, San Luis, San Pascual, Santa Teresita, Taal, Taysan and Tingloy.

== History ==

=== Kumintang ===
Kumintang was a large precolonial polity (&quot;bayan&quot;) around the Calumpang River in modern-day Batangas. According to local tradition, it was ruled by a legendary figure named Gat Pulintan, who refused to be Christianized and settled to the hills to take refuge and continue resistance against Spanish occupation. It became a Spanish town in 1581 and unofficially renamed as Batangan.

=== Foreign rule ===
The first Spanish missionaries arrived in Batangas City in 1572 due to group migration. Finally, in 1581, Spanish authorities governing the Philippines created a &quot;pueblo&quot; in the area which included the hill (now &quot;Hilltop&quot;) where the present Provincial Capitol of Batangas stands after the formal end of Kumintang. The town was named &quot;Batangan&quot; because huge logs, locally called &quot;batang&quot;, abounded in the place. The Spanish government appointed Don Agustin Casilao as Batangan&#x27;s first gobernadorcillo. Said title of &quot;little governor&quot; as head of the pueblo or &quot;municipio&quot; was replaced in 1894 by &quot;capital municipal&quot;. It is not clear who succeeded Casilao nor is it known whether there were subsequent appointments of capital municipal. Don Agustin Casilao is sometimes referred to as Agustino or Augustino in some sources. By 1870, its barangays were Balagtas, Bilogo, Bolbok, Bukal, Catandala, Konde, De La Paz, Kumintang Ibaba, Matuko, Mapagong, Paharang Kanluran, Pairang, Pinamucan, Patulo, Sampaga, San Agapito, San Isidro and Talahib.

At the coming of the Americans in the early 1900s, local civil government of Batangas was set up. It took effect on July 4, 1901, with Jose Villanueva elected as &quot;Municipal President.&quot; His term expired in 1903.

Subsequent elections installed the following as municipal presidents: Juan Palacios, 1904–1905; Jose Arguelles, 1906; Marcelo Llana, 1907; Sisenando Ferriols, 1908–1909; Ventura Tolentino, 1910–1914; Julian Rosales, 1915; Juan Gutierrez, 1916–1919; Julian Rosales, 1920–1922; Juan Buenafe, 1923–1930; Perfecto Condez, 1931–1937; Juan Buenafe, 1938–1940.
In 1941 the title &quot;Municipal President&quot; was changed to &quot;Municipal Mayor.&quot; Pedro Berberabe was elected first municipal mayor.

Batangas City was severely damaged due to the Japanese A6M Zero bombardment and on December 12, 1941, the Batangas Airport which is located in Barangay Alangilan is totally destroyed. On October 14, 1943, municipal councilor Roman L. Perez was appointed Mayor by the Japanese after the inauguration of the Second Republic of the Philippines. Liberation begun when 158th Regimental Combat Team (or 158th RCT) under the command of the US 6th Army reached Poblacion, Batangas City by March 11 during the Philippines Liberation Campaign of 1944–45. By the end of April the same that year, some elements of the 188th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 11th Airborne Division was left to clear the barangays east and mountains south of the city as the main Allied Force continued their drive towards the Quezon Province. Some of local guerrillas and irregulars of the President Quezon&#x27;s Own Guerrillas (PQOG) was entering and re-invaded in Batangas City. Throughout the battle, recognized guerrilla fighters played an important key role in the advancement of the combined American and Philippine troops, providing key roads and information for the Japanese location of defenses and movements. Hostilities ended as the war came closer to the end.

=== Independence and onwards ===

After the Liberation, President Manuel Roxas issued his reappointment. Mayor Perez ran and won in 1944, the first post-War elections in the country. In November 1949, he was killed by an unknown assassin. Vice Mayor Atilano Magadia succeeded Perez as Mayor, serving until 1951. Mayor Macario Chavez was elected in 1951; his four-year term ended in 1955.

People voted Pedro S. Tolentino overwhelmingly as mayor in 1956. He was reelected three times.

=== Cityhood ===
In 1965, Republic Act No. 4586 was signed by President Diosdado Macapagal, converting Batangas into a city. If successful, it would be renamed as Laurel, after former President Jose P. Laurel, a native of Tanauan. However, the voters rejected the cityhood and renaming of Batangas in a plebiscite.

On June 21, 1969, Republic Act No. 5495 was enacted to convert Batangas into a city, this time using its same name. Later on July 23, Batangas formally became a city by virtue of Proclamation No. 581 that was signed a week earlier. Pedro S. Tolentino became its first city mayor.

=== Contemporary history ===
The succeeding city mayors are Mayor Macario M. Mendoza, 1974–1979; Alfredo M. Borbon, 1979–1980, Conrado C. Berberabe, 1980–1986; Jose M. Atienza, 1986–1987; Mario M. Perez, 1987, Eduardo B. Dimacuha, 1988–1998, Angelito A. Dimacuha, 1998–2001 and again Eduardo B. Dimacuha, 2001–2010, Vilma A. Dimacuha, 2010–2013 and again Eduardo B. Dimacuha, 2013–2016, Beverley Rose A. Dimacuha, 2016–present.

<text>King&#x27;s Hall was one of the earliest constituent colleges of University of Cambridge. It was founded in 1317, the second after Peterhouse. King&#x27;s Hall was established by King Edward II to provide chancery clerks for his administration, and was rich compared to nearby Michaelhouse, which occupied the southern area of what is now Great Court, Trinity College, Cambridge. Henry VIII combined King&#x27;s Hall, Michaelhouse and seven hostels to form Trinity College, Cambridge in 1546.

==History==

Alan Cobban has identified John Hotham, Bishop of Ely, as the person who guided Edward II in this foundation. It received letters patent from Edward III in 1337. In 1412, the master or warden is recorded as Richard Derham. In 1433, Richard Pyghtesley was described as a clerk, in King&#x27;s Hall ().

King&#x27;s Hall no longer exists, as it was combined with Michaelhouse in the mid 16th century by King Henry VIII, as one of his last acts. At the time, the King had been wiping out and seizing Church lands from monasteries. It is thought that the King had great plans to create a college to rival Oxford&#x27;s Christ Church with great new architecture, but he died a few weeks after the college was created. The layout of Great Court is mainly due to Thomas Nevile, a master of Trinity. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge, being both religious institutions and quite rich, expected to be the next target, and, indeed, the King duly passed an Act of Parliament that allowed him to suppress (and confiscate the property of) any college he wished.

The universities of Oxford and Cambridge remained dominated by Anglican clergy until well into the 19th century - this was one of the driving aspects for the setting up of secular institutions, e.g. University College, London to cater for dissenters.

The universities used their contacts to plead with Henry VIII&#x27;s sixth wife, Catherine Parr. The Queen persuaded her husband not to close them down, but to create a new college. The King did not want to use royal funds, so he instead combined the two colleges of King&#x27;s Hall and Michaelhouse and seven hostels of Catherine&#x27;s, Garratt, Gregory&#x27;s, Margaret&#x27;s, Ovyng&#x27;s, Physwick (formerly part of Gonville and Caius) and Tyler&#x27;s to form Trinity in 1546. This, combined with lands confiscated from the Church, caused Trinity to be the richest and biggest college, a position it has retained.

==Location==
King&#x27;s Hall was located in what is now the northern section of the Great Court of Trinity College, and there still stands an original building from that time. It is found off Great Court next to the Chapel, and contains some of the most coveted rooms in the College, generally held only by long-standing fellows of great academic merit, staircases C and D Great Court. The Clock Tower was from King&#x27;s Hall but was moved from where the sundial now is, and the Great Gate of Trinity was built just before the amalgamation and thus still bears the King&#x27;s Hall name, in Latin. The last buildings of Michaelhouse were recorded as being knocked down with the completion of the southern section of Great Court.

<text>&quot;11001001&quot; is the fifteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. It was first broadcast on February 1, 1988, in the United States in broadcast syndication. It was written by Maurice Hurley and Robert Lewin, and directed by Paul Lynch.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. In this episode, members of an alien race called the Bynars hijack a nearly evacuated &quot;Enterprise&quot; while retrofitting the computer in space dock.

Make-up supervisor Michael Westmore created the look of the Bynars, who were four women in extensive make-up. The musical score was scored by Ron Jones. Reviewers praised the Bynars themselves, and the response to the episode was generally positive, with one critic calling it the best of the season. It was awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at Starbase 74 for a routine maintenance check. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) greet Starbase Commander Quinteros (Gene Dynarski) and two pairs of small humanoid aliens known as Bynars; the Bynars heavily rely on their computer technology and work in pairs for best efficiency. Much of the crew take shore leave while Picard, Riker and a skeleton crew remain aboard. Riker is intrigued by the Bynars&#x27; claimed upgrades to the holodeck and starts a program in a jazz bar. The program includes a woman named Minuet (Carolyn McCormick), by whom Riker is fascinated, both as a beautiful and charming woman, but also by the level of sophistication in her responses. Riker shortly returns, and Picard walks in on him kissing Minuet, and he too is amazed by the simulation.

Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly create a catastrophic failure in the ship&#x27;s warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, assuming them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship&#x27;s controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by intra-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.

After canceling the self-destruct, they find the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; computers, but they are unable to decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation about what is going on as the ship nears the orbit of Bynaus. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, killing the Bynars. They had used the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data&#x27;s help, Picard and Riker download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the same as before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.

==Production==

The name &quot;11001001&quot; is a binary number, a concatenation of the names of the Bynars (One One, Zero Zero, One Zero, and Zero One). The episode at one point was called &quot;10101001&quot;. It was originally intended that this episode would take place prior to &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot;, with the Bynars&#x27; modifications causing the problems with the holodeck seen in that episode. Instead it was changed to the Bynars aiming to fix the holodeck to prevent those problems from recurring. The Bynars themselves were played by young women. Children were considered for the parts, but the production team thought that it would be too troublesome because of the limited time they could work each day and the need to hire teachers. Each actress was required to wear extensive make-up, which was created by make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. A large single-piece bald cap was made from the same mold for each actress, which required some customised trimming to get it to fit properly. To cover up problems with the seams of the cap, some fake hair was added on the Bynars&#x27; necks. Each actress also controlled the flashing light inside the apparatus on the side of the headpiece through a battery pack attached to the waistband of their costumes. To disguise their voices, the pitch was lowered in post production. It was originally planned to add subtitles over the Bynars&#x27; conversations between themselves.

The image of the Starbase orbiting a planet was re-used from &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;. The score was created by Ron Jones, who incorporated jazz themes composed by John Beasley. The episode was written by Maurice Hurley and Robert Lewin. Hurley was pleased with the outcome of the episode, praising the work of Westmore on the Bynars&#x27; makeup and the performance of Jonathan Frakes. Frakes enjoyed the episode, too, saying, &quot;A fabulous show. Those were the kind of chances we took first season that when they worked, they worked great. It was a very chancy show and I loved it.&quot; Director Paul Lynch also thought that the Bynars were &quot;great&quot;. Carolyn McCormick appeared as Minuet and subsequently became a regular cast member in &quot;Law and Order&quot;. She returned to the role of Minuet in the season four episode &quot;Future Imperfect&quot;. Gene Dynarski had previously appeared as Ben Childress in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot; and Krodak in &quot;The Mark of Gideon&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;11001001&quot; aired in broadcast syndication during the week commencing February 7, 1988. It received Nielsen ratings of 10.7, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. These ratings were lower than both the episodes broadcast both before and afterwards. For their work in this episode, Bill Wistrom, Wilson Dyer, Mace Matiosian, James Wolvington, Gerry Sackman and Keith Bilderbeck were awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it No. 6 on its list of the top 10 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes for the magazine&#x27;s celebration of the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 1996.

Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website &quot;Den of Geek&quot; in January 2013. He was surprised by the episode as he &quot;went in expecting something that was typically season one awful, and got something that was actually a lot of fun&quot;. He thought that the theme of symbiosis between man and machine was &quot;interesting&quot;, stating it was the best episode up until that point in season one and one of the best of the season overall. Zack Handlen watched the episode for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in May 2010. He too was surprised by what he found. Handlen said that &quot;last time I saw it, I thought Riker and Minuet&#x27;s interactions were cheesy as hell. They didn&#x27;t bother me so much now, because they don&#x27;t go on very long, and there&#x27;s something hilarious about a man trying to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions&quot;. But he said, &quot;I had fun with this, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting&quot;, and &quot;thought this was solid&quot;. He gave the episode a B grade.

Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He described it as &quot;one of the strongest first-season episodes&quot;, and the Bynars as &quot;one of the finest alien species &quot;Trek&quot; has provided&quot;. He also thought that turning off the auto-destruct with two minutes to go instead of mere seconds neatly avoided a cliché, and gave it a score of seven out of ten. Michelle Erica Green for TrekNation watched the episode in June 2007. She thought that it came &quot;very close to being a really good episode&quot;. She also thought that Picard and Riker&#x27;s actions were the &quot;most boneheaded joint behavior by the top two officers&quot;, in that they got distracted by a female character on the holodeck and didn&#x27;t notice the ship being evacuated. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website &quot;Jammer&#x27;s Reviews&quot; described &quot;11001001&quot; as &quot;easily season one&#x27;s best and most memorable episode&quot;. He thought that it was the &quot;season&#x27;s most solid sci-fi concept&quot; and that the series was &quot;firing on all cylinders, with everything coming together, from plot to character, to sensible use of technology and action&quot;. He gave it a score of four out of four.

In 2011, this episode was noted by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one that explores the implications of advanced technology, especially the connection between people and technology. They compare this to the later episode &quot;The Nth Degree&quot;. Also of note, they point out the modifications to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D holodeck, allows it to pass an impromptu turing test by the character Commander Riker. In 2012, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine said this was one of the best episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Minuet, the holographic lady featured in the show, as the seventh best holodeck character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

==Home media release==
The first home media release of &quot;11001001&quot; was on VHS cassette, appearing on August 26, 1992, in the United States and Canada. The episode was later included on the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; season one DVD box set, released in March 2002, and then released as part of the season one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012.

<text>Gawalmandi Food Street (, &quot;Sarak-e-Khorak Gwolmandi&quot;) is a food street located near Gawalmandi neighbourhood of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Historically it was a posh place and many of the families that migrated to Lahore from Amritsar and nearby cities, after the creation of Pakistan, settled in Gawalmandi. A lack of employment opportunities lead many of them to open up small shops in front of their houses. The migrating families brought along with them new and unique cuisine and recipes, laying the foundation a street well known for its great food.

<doc id="654014" wikidata="Q1267955" url="?curid=654014" title="Jerdon's courser">
<text>Jerdon&#x27;s courser (Rhinoptilus bitorquatus) is a nocturnal bird belonging to the pratincole and courser family Glareolidae endemic to India. The bird was discovered by the surgeon-naturalist Thomas C. Jerdon in 1848 but not seen again until its rediscovery in 1986. This courser is a restricted-range endemic found locally in India in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh. It is currently known only from the Sri Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary, and Sri Penusila Narasimha Wildlife Sanctuary where it inhabits sparse scrub forest with patches of bare ground.

== Description ==

It is an unmistakable compact courser, with two brown breast-bands. It has a yellow base to the black bill, a blackish crown, broad buff supercilium, and an orange-chestnut throat patch. A narrow white crown stripe runs on top of the head. In-flight it shows a mostly black tail and a prominent white wing bar. It is crepuscular and vocal at dawn and dusk with a series of staccato &quot;Twick-too...Twick-too... Twick-too&quot; or &quot;yak-wak.. yak-wak&quot; calls. The notes are repeated at the rate of about 1 per second and uttered 2 to 16 times and several birds in the vicinity may join in the calling.

Jerdon described the Telugu name of the species as &quot;Adavi wuta-titti&quot; meaning &quot;Jungle empty-purse&quot;. This name may however have been in error since Salim Ali and Hugh Whistler found villagers mystified by the name when they searched for the species near Borgampad and Nelipaka during the Hyderabad state survey of 1931. Recent researchers have noted the local name as &quot;Kalivi kodi&quot;.

The only known egg of the bird is preserved at the Zoology Museum, University of Aberdeen. The egg was collected by Ernest Gilbert Meaton, a vet working at Kolar Gold Fields, in the year 1917.
== Distribution and habitat ==
It is endemic to southern India, where it is principally known from southern Andhra Pradesh. It has an extremely limited geographical range being known from the Godaveri river valley near Sironcha and Bhadrachalam, and from the Cuddapah and Anantpur areas in the valley of the Pennar River. An egg, probably collected within 100 km of Kolar in 1917, was positively identified as belonging to this species using DNA sequence comparison. It is mostly active at dusk and during the night. It was first recorded in the mid 19th century; it was then considered to be extinct for more than 80 years, until it was rediscovered in 1986 at Cuddapah District, Andhra Pradesh. In Maharashtra it was reported at &quot;24 km east of Sironcha, near the Godavari river, three birds, undated (Blanford 1867, 1869), and sometime in the 20-year period before 1935 (D&#x27;Abreu, 1935)&quot;. The species was known from specimens collected at a few locations in eastern peninsular India and the currently known population is extremely restricted in range. Studies in this region using sand strips to detect footprints suggest that their preferred habitat has tall bushes at a density of 300 to 700 per hectare.

==Taxonomy ==
The species was first collected by Thomas C. Jerdon from somewhere in the Eastern Ghats. The specimen was presented to the Asiatic Society of Bengal where the curator, Edward Blyth described it, naming it as &quot;Macrotarsius rhinoptilus&quot;. These collections were moved to the Indian Museum in 1866 following a financial crisis. Some specimens had been mounted and exhibited for the public but John Anderson moved the type specimens for safe storage in 1872. The type specimens used by Blyth were catalogued but the specimen used by Blyth was already missing. A second catalogue by W.L. Sclater in 1892 also failed to list the specimen. The type specimen is therefore presumed lost. A second specimen collected by Jerdon was obtained by Strickland and is now in the collection of the Cambridge University. This specimen was examined by Strickland who used the new genus and combination, &quot;Rhinoptilus bitorquatus&quot;. The label written by Alfred Newton notes the location as &quot;Madras&quot; and date as 1846. During this period Jerdon is thought to have received specimens from near Nellore or Cuddapah. A third specimen in Jerdon&#x27;s collection was acquired by Thomas Campbell Eyton and then to Henry Baker Tristram, and the specimen is now at National Museums Liverpool. Several other specimens exist in collections but a neotype, replacement for the type specimen, has not been suggested.

== Status ==

This bird was known only from a few historical records and was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1986. It was rediscovered by Bharat Bhushan, an ornithologist at the Bombay Natural History Society who made use of local trappers to capture a specimen. Prior to its rediscovery it was thought to be a diurnal bird. It remains critically endangered due to loss of habitat. It is nocturnal in habit and presumed to be insectivorous. Being a rare bird, nothing is known yet about its behaviour and nesting habits.

Population estimates for the bird range from between 50 and 249. Recent studies have made use of techniques such as camera trapping and carefully placed strips of fine sand to record footprints from which estimates of population density are made. The known world population of the species is restricted to a very small region and attempts have been made to find new areas by distributing pictures and small electronic call players to people in neighbouring regions that share similar habitats. Searches during 2008 in its former habitat near Sironcha in Gadchiroli district in eastern Maharashtra failed to find the birds.

In 1988 the Indian Postal Service released a stamp to commemorate the rediscovery.

In 2022, the central government sanctioned Rupees 50 lakh to study the bird. The money is said to be used for installing CCTV cameras and sound recording equipment to track its movement.

== Threats ==

The construction of the Somasilla Dam led to the residents of 57 villages being relocated into the region where the courser was rediscovered. These areas of Lankamala, Palakonda and Seshachalam were previously not well populated. With the rising population, there was increased livestock pressures and firewood extraction. In addition, extensive quarrying threatens the habitat. The scrub habitat preferred by the bird has declined due to increased agricultural activity.
In December 2005, the only known location for the species was threatened by the Telugu Ganga project, a scheme to supply water to the city of Chennai. Legal action led to the diversion of the canal. The area has however continued to be threatened by illegal construction work and activity related to a project proposed to link the rivers of India. The construction of the canal could also lead to increased agricultural activity and habitat changes.

<text>Matthew David Lewis (born 27 June 1989) is an English actor. He is best known for his role as Neville Longbottom in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series.

Born in Leeds, Lewis made his acting debut in &quot;Some Kind of Life&quot; (1995), guest-starring on dramas for ITV and BBC One before appearing in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001). Lewis played the role for ten years, concluding with the final film, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011), for which he received critical praise. Following the series, Lewis had a recurring role in &quot;The Syndicate&quot; and performed his first theatre role in &quot;Our Boys&quot; at the Duchess Theatre in 2012.

Lewis starred in &quot;The Rise&quot; (2012) which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews and made appearances on BBC dramas &quot;Bluestone 42&quot; and &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Lewis had a supporting role in &quot;Me Before You&quot; (2016), which became a box office success. He was cast in the crime dramas &quot;Ripper Street&quot; and &quot;Happy Valley&quot; before starring on the ITV drama &quot;Girlfriends&quot; in 2018. Lewis appeared in &quot;Terminal&quot; (2018), which premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival as well as &quot;Baby Done&quot; (2020). In 2020-2021, Lewis starred in Channel 5 television series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; to critical praise.

==Early life==
Matthew David Lewis was born on 27 June 1989 in Leeds, West Yorkshire, to Adrian Lewis and Lynda Needham. He was raised in the nearby town of Horsforth. He has two older brothers: Chris, a film editor, and Anthony, an actor. He was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Menston Catholic Voluntary Academy.

==Career==
===1995–2000: Beginnings===
Lewis has been acting since age five. He made his professional debut in television film &quot;Some Kind of Life&quot; (1995), directed by Kay Mellor. He guest-starred in the BBC One crime drama &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; before appearing in ITV series&#x27; &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; in 1999 and 2000, respectively.

===2001–2011: &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and recognition===

In 1999, castings were held across the UK for &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, the film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling&#x27;s novel. Lewis, a fan of the series, initially attended an open audition at the Queens Hotel, Leeds, before being contacted two months later to perform a screen test for director Chris Columbus, eventually earning the role of Neville Longbottom. &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; was released in 2001 and became a critical and commercial hit. For the role, Lewis wore a set of false teeth, shoes two sizes too big, a fat suit and ear prosthetics. He reprised his role a year later in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;; Lewis has stated that his favorite lines stem from the film.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2005) both premiered to critical acclaim. &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; was released in 2007. During filming, co-star Helena Bonham Carter accidentally ruptured Lewis&#x27; eardrum when she stuck her wand in his ear during a scene. Lewis commented on enjoying the &quot;diverse nature&quot; of his role in the film which contained more &quot;emotion and drama&quot; than its predecessors. &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; became the second-highest-grossing film of 2009. In a 2009 interview, Lewis spoke about his experience working with director David Yates, discussing &quot;about what Neville would be doing and feeling, even [..] in the background.&quot; In April 2011, Lewis made his stage debut as Lester Cole in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Verdict&quot; touring production.

Lewis returned once more for the final &quot;Harry Potter&quot; installments, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; (2010) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011). His performance was praised by critics for his &quot;scene stealing potential&quot;; &quot;CTV News&quot; referred to Lewis as a &quot;breakout stud&quot; and &quot;man of action&quot;. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; author J. K. Rowling gave a speech at the premiere of &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; in London, where she stated that there were seven major cast members in the series, whom she referred to as &quot;The Big Seven&quot; (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Lewis, Evanna Lynch and Bonnie Wright).

===2012–present: Further work and television===

In 2012, Lewis portrayed Jamie Bradley in Kay Mellor&#x27;s five-part BBC One television drama &quot;The Syndicate&quot;. He made his West End debut, playing Mick in &quot;Our Boys&quot;, at the Duchess Theatre from September to December 2012. Lewis co-starred in the 2012 crime film &quot;The Rise&quot;, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. &quot;Express&quot; stated that &quot;Lewis provide[s] as much pleasure as the mechanics of the twisted revenge plot.&quot; He starred in two series of the South Africa filmed black comedy &quot;Bluestone 42&quot;, which premiered on BBC Three in 2013. In 2015, Lewis guest-starred on the television crime drama &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;.

Lewis played Patrick, the boyfriend of Emilia Clarke&#x27;s character, in &quot;Me Before You&quot; (2016), which proved to be a commercial success. &quot;Bustle&quot; noted that &quot;Lewis&#x27; role is one mostly of comedic relief&quot; but the actor &quot;plays the character&#x27;s outrage perfectly&quot;; Lewis stated he was careful not to make the role a &quot;laughed-off villain, but a fully-formed character.&quot; That same year, Lewis reoccurred in two BBC productions, crime dramas &quot;Ripper Street&quot; and &quot;Happy Valley&quot;. He starred alongside Niamh Cusack in the London premiere of &quot;Unfaithful&quot;, written by playwright Owen McCafferty, from August to October 2016. In 2017, Lewis, a friend of comedian Sal Vulcano, made an appearance on &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot; as himself filling in for Vulcano, which was shot at Universal Orlando.

In 2018, he starred on the ITV drama &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, written by Mellor, and appeared in the 2018 neo-noir &quot;Terminal&quot;, which premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival to negative reviews. Lewis starred opposite Rose Matafeo in &quot;Baby Done&quot; (2020), produced by Taika Waititi. &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised his &quot;thoroughly likable performance&quot; as well as the &quot;laid-back&quot; chemistry between him and Matafeo. Lewis appeared in the Yorkshire-set television series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, which aired on Channel 5 in 2020 to high ratings and critical acclaim. &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to Lewis&#x27; portrayal as a &quot;dashing suitor&quot; who achieved the character&#x27;s &quot;natural confidence [..] incredibly well.&quot; The programme was renewed for a second series in December 2020.

In 2022, Lewis appeared in the &quot;Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts&quot; film as himself, along with most of the original &quot;Harry Potter&quot; cast.

Lewis will star in the Acorn TV/Channel 5 series &quot;Murder Before Evensong&quot;, based on the novel by Richard Coles.

==Personal life==
Lewis married Angela Jones in Italy on 28 May 2018, after the two had become engaged in November 2016. The couple had met in January of that year, when Lewis participated in the annual &quot;Celebration of Harry Potter&quot; event at Universal Orlando, where Jones was a VIP event manager for the resort and the event.
Lewis is a vice-president of the Leeds Rugby Foundation charity. Lewis hosts the Leeds United podcast &quot;Doing a Leeds&quot; with former professional footballer Jermaine Beckford.
In February 2021, it was announced that Lewis became the first Patron of the Bambisanani Partnership.

<text>The Scaled Composites Model 318 White Knight (now also called &quot;White Knight One&quot;) is a jet-powered carrier aircraft that was used to launch its companion SpaceShipOne, an experimental spaceplane. The White Knight and SpaceShipOne were designed by Burt Rutan and manufactured by Scaled Composites, a private company founded by Rutan in 1982. On three separate flights in 2004, White Knight conducted SpaceShipOne into flight, and SpaceShipOne then performed a sub-orbital spaceflight, becoming the first private craft to reach space.

The White Knight is notable as an example of a mother ship which carried a parasite aircraft into flight, releasing the latter which would then execute a high-altitude flight, or a sub-orbital spaceflight. This flight profile is shared with &quot;The High and Mighty One&quot; and &quot;Balls 8&quot;, two modified B-52s which carried the North American X-15 into flight. It is also shared with White Knight Two, a descendant which carries SpaceShipTwo into flight as part of the Virgin Galactic fleet.

Following the SpaceShipOne flights, the White Knight was contracted for drop tests of the Boeing X-37 spaceplane, from June 2005 until April 2006. The White Knight was retired from service in 2014, and is in the inventory of the Flying Heritage Collection.

==Design and development==


The Scaled Composites model number for White Knight is 318. White Knight is registered with the Federal Aviation Administration as 

The White Knight carrier airplane was designed around the twin afterburning General Electric J85 engines, which were selected for their availability and low cost. The aircraft was a completely new independent design. White Knight and SpaceShipOne shared the same forward fuselage outer mold line (OML) to reduce development costs and with the original intent to allow for White Knight to act as a flying simulator for training SpaceShipOne pilots. White Knight first flew on August 1, 2002. The flight was aborted shortly after takeoff due to a problem with the outboard wing spoilers. These trailing edge spoilers were designed to greatly increase the glide slope so that the White Knight vehicle could act as a flying simulator for training of SpaceShipOne pilots. During the first flight, the mechanical over-center torque was insufficient to maintain the spoilers in the closed position. The spoilers deployed into the free stream and began a limit cycle forcing the pilot (Mike Melvill) to abort. The spoilers were subsequently disabled completely and the desire for a steep glide slope matching SpaceShipOne was abandoned.

White Knight next flew on August 5, 2002, and this time performed well. Development proceeded over the next few months. With White Knight developed and evaluated, on April 18, 2003, White Knight and SpaceShipOne were presented to the media.

Subsequently, White Knight flew as part of the Tier One program that won the Ansari X Prize on October 4, 2004.

Afterwards, White Knight was used to carry and launch DARPA&#x27;s experimental X-37 spaceplane for its approach and landing tests in 2005 and 2006.

It was followed up by the White Knight Two, which has a similar but larger design.

==SpaceShipOne program==
Flights of White Knight are numbered, starting with flight 1 on August 1, 2002. Flights where SpaceShipOne was carried also get one or two appended letters. An appended &quot;C&quot; indicates that the flight was a captive carry, and &quot;L&quot; indicates that SpaceShipOne was launched. If the flight actually flown differs in category from the intended flight, then two letters are appended, the first giving the intended mission and the second the mission actually performed.

==X-37 test program==
White Knight was contracted to perform both captive carry and drop test flights of the DARPA/Boeing X-37. First captive carry flight was on June 21, 2005, and first drop was on April 7, 2006 (the X-37 was subsequently damaged on landing at Edwards Air Force Base). Initially, the flights originated from Mojave, but following the landing incident, the program was moved to Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, and at least five subsequent flights were made there.

==Adaptive Compliant Wing test program==
In late 2006, White Knight flew a seven-flight test program of the adaptive compliant wing developed by FlexSys Inc. with funding by the Air Force Research Laboratory. A laminar flow test article was mounted vertically under White Knight&#x27;s centerline pylon for the 20-flight-hour research program that tested the flexible wing&#x27;s aerodynamic characteristics.

==Retirement to museum==
In July 2014 White Knight made its final planned flight, arriving at Paine Field in Everett, Washington, to become part of the Flying Heritage Collection.

<doc id="654030" wikidata="Q1149590" url="?curid=654030" title="The Last Express">
<text>The Last Express is an adventure video game designed by Jordan Mechner and published by Broderbund in 1997 for PC. Players take on the role of an American who accepts an invite by a friend to join them on the Orient Express, days before the start of World War I, only to become involved in a maelstrom of treachery, lies, political conspiracies, personal interests, romance and murder, upon boarding the train. The game is unique in how it was created, its non-linear story, and in how events in the game are conducted within real-time.

The game was a commercial disappointment following its release, but received highly positive reviews and a positive post-release response. A Sony PlayStation port was in development, but was cancelled before it was finished. The game was later reacquired by Mechner, who worked with DotEmu to make portable versions of the game for iOS and Android, and later released a remade version for Steam, entitled &quot;The Last Express – Gold Edition&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
The game operates primarily from a first-person perspective of the story&#x27;s lead character when they explore the train, with cutscenes being conducted in the third-person. Gameplay takes place almost entirely within real-time, albeit accelerated by a factor of six; the only time when it is not conducted so is when the player&#x27;s character sleeps at certain intervals and when the player is on the game&#x27;s pause menu. Events within the game are scripted and thus occur at specific times denoted by the in-game clock – for example, a character leaving their compartment in order to go to the restaurant car in order to have lunch. When on the pause menu, the player can rewind time, either to a specific point, or to a specific destination on the express route (i.e., Paris), or the player can fast forward to a later time, up until the current point in the story that they have reached.

The main areas of the game are within the carriages of the train, with the player able to look around each place they are in, move down corridors, enter and leave compartments, knock on doors, and talk to people. Items within the game can be interacted with, either to be examined, or in some cases, collected by the player for use later on. The game&#x27;s story features around thirty characters, each of whom has their own artificial intelligence and individual agendas – they therefore conduct actions that allow them to complete their own personal goals, only changing their plans due to player intervention – with the game using a non-linear approach of story-telling, in which the player&#x27;s actions or in-actions, affect how the story plays out; the game&#x27;s many events led to its script being around 800 pages long.

The story features multiple endings, depending on the player&#x27;s actions. Around thirty of these are game overs, involving the main character being killed or arrested. Four are alternate endings; only one of these is the &quot;true&quot; ending.

== Story ==
=== Setting ===
The game&#x27;s story takes place in 1914, between 24 and 27 July, aboard the original Orient Express route between Paris and Constantinople (modern Istanbul), prior to the outbreak of World War I. Much of the game occurs within the train itself - consisting of the locomotive, two baggage cars, a restaurant car, two sleeping cars, and a private car. The plot written for the game, while a fictionalized idea regarding the last journey of the Orient Express in 1914, includes many traditional elements of a murder mystery, including secret plots and deals, lies and personal agendas, as well as featuring notable references to political climates in Europe.

=== Plot ===

Robert Cath, an American doctor on the run from the police in regards to a murder in Ireland, is invited by his friend Tyler Whitney to join him on the Orient Express. Boarding the train whilst it is moving through the outskirts of Paris, Cath finds Tyler dead in his sleeping compartment, apparently murdered. Dumping the body from the train during the course of the night&#x27;s journey, Cath assumes his friend&#x27;s identity and goes to greet the other passengers travelling on the Express. Amongst the passengers he meets several people of interest: August Schmidt, a German arms dealer; Anna Wolff, an Austrian violinist; Vassili Obolensky, a Russian count travelling with his granddaughter, Tatiana Obolenskaya; Alexei Dolnikov, a Russian anarchist and a childhood friend of Tatiana; Miloš Jovanović, a Serbian travelling with a group of associates; and Kronos, a mysterious art collector travelling in a private car with his African servant Kahina.

Cath discovers, through the course of investigating Tyler&#x27;s death during the journey to Strasbourg, that his friend was arranging the purchase of weapons from August and supplying these to the Black Hand, a Serbian rebel movement whom Miloš and his associates belong to. To facilitate the deal, Tyler was supplied with a Serbian national treasure called the Firebird - a mechanical music box that transforms into a bird, accompanied with a whistle shaped like a scarab beetle - which he intended to sell to Kronos for the payment August was to receive. Cath finds the Firebird treasure is missing, and is left in the difficult position of finding it to complete Tyler&#x27;s arrangements. During the night, Cath discovers that Anna knows he is not Tyler, leading him to suspect she knows more about his friend&#x27;s death. However, Vassili suffers a mental breakdown in his compartment that interrupts their conversation, while forcing Cath to do what he can to treat him. Following the incident, Cath overhears Anna asking Tatiana to look after something, but cannot determine what it is.

The following morning in Munich, Cath witnesses an Englishman named George Abbot board the Express, whilst August oversees the loading of his merchandise, and finds him inquisitive about Cath&#x27;s treatment of Vassili. Whilst the train is en route to Vienna, Cath finds a French boy in possession of the Firebird&#x27;s whistle, and recovers it with a small trade. He also has a meeting with Kronos, who himself knows he is using Tyler&#x27;s identity, and slowly distrusts him, especially as Kahina begins snooping around the sleeping cars. When Kronos invites Anna to perform a concert with him for the other passengers, Cath uses the opportunity to search the train. He soon finds the Firebird itself in Tatiana&#x27;s compartment, but hides it within the kennel for Anna&#x27;s dog Max in one of the train&#x27;s baggage cars. After this, he breaks into Krono&#x27;s compartment to borrow his payment in order to ensure August keeps his weapons on the Express. Following the concert, Cath encounters Anna in the baggage car while he is examining August&#x27;s weapons, and learns from her she took the Firebird, but that Tyler was dead when she did so. She also admits to serving the Austrian government as a spy, but does not specify her mission.

In Vienna, Kronos and Khinana leave the Express without the Firebird. After the train departs, Tatiana consults Cath over deep concerns she has for Alexei, fearing he plans to kill her grandfather for the injustices he served upon his father. On the evening stretch to Budapest, Alexei attempts his plan, but is killed by Vassili, traumatizing Tatiana, while Cath is forced to defuse a bomb Alexei had planted on the train. Abbot shares a drink with him following this, confessing that he was investigating rumours concerning Alexei, while also noting he believes Cath, whom he recognised, is innocent of the murder in Ireland. Visiting Anna in her compartment, Cath becomes romantically involved with her, but the pair are shocked when the train doesn&#x27;t stop in Budapest. They swiftly are captured by Miloš and his associates, who have hijacked the train. After freeing himself, Cath fights to free the passengers and railways crew. To protect them, Cath detaches the rear carriages from the train, after they head to them; only Anna and her dog, Vassili, Tatiana and Abbot remain on board the Express. Cath regains control of the locomotive, after Anna shoots Miloš to save its engineer, but refuses to let the Express stop within Austria and keeps it going on into and through Serbia.

As the train makes its way to Turkey, Anna relunctantly accepts she cannot stop Cath&#x27;s plans, while Cath himself admits he felt powerless to discovering who really killed Tyler, assuming that one of the Serbs was involved. The pair embrace each other in the moment, and sleep together in the dining car. After a stopover upon crossing into Turkey, Cath is shocked when Kronos turns up on the train with Kahina, intent on claiming the Firebird. Cath is forced to provide it, as Anna is held at gunpoint. But when demonstrating its functions, Cath uses the whistle to activate its hidden function as a living weapon, causing it to kill both Kronos and Kahina; in the process exposing how Tyler died. In the confusion, Cath and Anna jump from the train with Max in tow, as it pulls into Constantinople&#x27;s Sirkeci Station. However, an unhinged Tatiana finds explosives amongst the weapons in the baggage car, and, wishing for no more war, detonates them with Alexei&#x27;s lighter, destroying the baggage car and killing herself, Vassili, Abbot and the driver. In the chaos after the explosion, Cath and Anna hear a Turkish boy proclaim that war has broken out in Europe. Forced to return home, Anna leaves Cath with Max, kisses him, and promises to see him again when the war is over. The game ends on a time-lapsing map of Europe, showing the change in borders between 1914-1994.

==History==
Mechner founded Smoking Car Productions to create &quot;The Last Express&quot;. The company was located in San Francisco from 1993 to 1997 and at its peak had sixty full-time employees.

Mechner derived inspiration for &quot;The Last Express&quot; from &quot;Myst&quot; and Infocom&#x27;s &quot;Deadline&quot;. He saw &quot;The Last Express&quot; as an opportunity to create a game with a complexity of story and depth of characters comparable to that seen in a film, something he felt he could not accomplish with his games for the Apple II due to hardware limitations. He said of the game&#x27;s approach to storytelling: 

=== Art production ===

The game is notable for its unique art style, with characters illustrated in the Art Nouveau style that was popular in 1914, the year the game&#x27;s events take place. Since illustrating a game of this magnitude by hand would likely take an exorbitant amount of time, the look was achieved by using rotoscoping, a process that Mechner had used in &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;. During a 22-day-long live-action video shoot, every action by every character in the game was photographed by actors wearing distinctive makeup and costumes against a bluescreen on 16mm film and digitized. From this, a limited number of frames were selected and put through a patented process developed in house, where the frames first had all their colour removed. Next, a powerful computer program created black-and-white line drawings of the frames; these were coloured by hand. The finished product has 40,000 frames.

=== Publishing ===
Following a bidding war between several major game publishers, Broderbund, SoftBank, and GameBank split the worldwide distribution rights. Dubbed versions of the game were released in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian (unofficial bootlegged localization), and Japanese.

=== Release ===
The game was released 1997, after five years of development, at a final cost of US$5–6million, on a multi-platform 3-CD set that covered Windows, Mac OS, and MS-DOS. &quot;The Last Express&quot; received highly positive reviews both in print and online, but only remained in stores for a few months.

Broderbund did little to promote the game, apart from a brief mention in a press release and enthusiastic statements by Broderbund executives, in part due to the entire Broderbund marketing team quitting in the weeks before its release. Softbank pulled out of the game market, dissolved its subsidiary GameBank, and cancelled several dozen titles in development, including the nearly finished PlayStation port of &quot;The Last Express&quot;. In a final blow, Broderbund was acquired by The Learning Company, which was not interested in &quot;The Last Express&quot;. Within a year of its release, &quot;The Last Express&quot; was out of print. Withal, Mechner&#x27;s company Smoking Car Productions quietly folded.

== Soundtrack ==

Running thirty-nine minutes, the soundtrack for &quot;The Last Express&quot; was published by Intrada Records in 2000, but is no longer in print. It was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by American composer born in Czechoslovakia, Elia Cmiral, who later composed the scores for &quot;Ronin&quot; and &quot;Stigmata&quot;. Consisting of a mix of dominant synth instruments and occasional solo violin, the score was recorded at Forte Muzika Studios in Los Angeles. The lone exception is the Sonata for Violin and Piano in A major by César Franck featured in the game&#x27;s concert scene.

As of May 2011, the soundtrack is included as a digital release given away free with the DotEmu and GOG.com versions of &quot;The Last Express&quot;.

== Reception ==
In 2008, producer Mark Netter declared that &quot;The Last Express&quot; was &quot;a total commercial failure.&quot; Shortly before its launch, the sales and marketing department at publisher Broderbund left the company. As a result, the game received very little marketing to support its release. The game&#x27;s global distribution was divided between Broderbund, GAMEBANK, and its parent company SoftBank Group. However, SoftBank soon exited the game industry and closed GAMEBANK, which resulted in the cancellation of a &quot;nearly finished PlayStation port of &quot;Express&quot;&quot;, according to programmer Mark Moran.

&quot;The Last Express&quot; achieved sales of 100,000 units by 2000, and failed to break even. Netter noted that, given its $5-million-dollar budget, &quot;The Last Express&quot; &quot;would have had to be one of the top-selling games of all time&quot; to recoup its development costs. Moran said that it was ultimately one million sales short of breaking even.

Following the purchase of Broderbund by The Learning Company, the publisher&#x27;s business was restructured to focus exclusively on edutainment software. &quot;The Last Express&quot; soon went out of print. Netter noted in 2008, &quot;By the summer of 1997, two months after it had been released, you could no longer buy it.&quot; These problems, according to Chris Remo of Gamasutra, left &quot;The Last Express&quot; &quot;unable to reach the long tail sales on which adventure games traditionally had thrived.&quot; GameSpot&#x27;s Bruce Geryk argued in 2000 that the failure of &quot;The Last Express&quot; could &quot;in some ways be considered the beginning of the end for the adventure genre.&quot;

===Critical reviews===
&quot;The Last Express&quot; received highly positive reviews. Critics hailed the game&#x27;s authentic and compelling period ambiance, complex and unpredictable story, captivating musical score, and unique visual style. Many said that they were compelled to eavesdrop on the various characters&#x27; conversations simply to follow their subplots, which give the player the sensation of really being on a train.

The voice acting was also widely praised for the convincing performances and authentic foreign accents. Reactions to the real-time system were more mixed; some said that, while it adds to the tension and immersion in the game, it often requires the player to rewatch numerous scenes when they fail, or sit and wait when they accomplish a segment&#x27;s tasks early. A few also found that the game does not implement enough originality in its interface or puzzles, too often feeling like another generic adventure game. &quot;Next Generation&quot; concluded that &quot;Enjoyment of &quot;The Last Express&quot; depends mostly on one&#x27;s appreciation for the story and one&#x27;s acceptance of the standard mechanics. As an attempt at something different, however, we liked it.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; was more enthusiastic, calling it &quot;a captivating look at real-life events from a semi-fictional adventure gaming angle&quot;, and &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that &quot;through its use of real time and brilliant writing, the game ups the ante for storytelling in gaming.&quot;

The editors of &quot;Macworld&quot; named &quot;The Last Express&quot; the best role-playing game of 1997. Steven Levy and Cameron Crotty of the magazine wrote, &quot;What makes &quot;The Last Express&quot; vividly memorable is the painstaking detail, particularly the lush score and the faithfully rendered sounds of the most famous train ever. So while you may never solve this three-disc conundrum, you&#x27;ll never forget the ride.&quot;

&quot;The Last Express&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s, CNET Gamecenter&#x27;s and GameSpot&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; awards, which went variously to &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Dark Earth&quot;. The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;The Last Express&quot; &quot;the year&#x27;s best mystery&quot; and &quot;stylish and intriguing&quot;, and those of GameSpot wrote, &quot;While a few minor gameplay problems held it back from the top spot, there is no doubt that &quot;The Last Express&quot; is one of the best adventure games of the last few years.&quot; Regardless, &quot;The Last Express&quot; did win GameSpot&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Best Story&quot; award, and was also the runner-up for the 1997 &quot;Best Ending&quot; award, which went to &quot;Fallout&quot;.

In 2000, &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; named &quot;The Last Express&quot; one of the &quot;10 Essential Graphic Adventures&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Steve Bauman wrote, &quot;While it received terrific reviews, and its innovative storytelling engine should have pointed toward a bold new future for interactive fiction, it had disastrously low sales, essentially bankrupting the company that produced it and telling the industry that consumers weren&#x27;t interested in this type of game.&quot; In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;The Last Express&quot; the seventh-best adventure game ever released.

== Legacy ==
=== Re-release ===
In 2000, the &quot;Fallout&quot; video game series creator and game publisher Interplay bought the lapsed rights and began quietly selling the game as a budget title. A short time later, Interplay went bankrupt; once again, the game went out of print. In 2006, the American subscription-based game service GameTap began offering the game on its network.

On January 14, 2011, DotEmu released the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the game, which includes the soundtrack, a making-of video and a walkthrough. On January 26, 2011, Phoenix Licensing (the current copyright holder of the game) re-released the game in GOG.com, with all the extras of the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; –except the walkthrough– and only in English.

=== Mobile ports ===
Mechner was later able to reacquire the rights to the game and worked in 2012 with DotEmu to release iOS and Android ports of the title. On March 16, 2012, Mechner announced an upcoming release of the game for iOS devices, with &quot;additional enhancements to make it more iOS-friendly.&quot; The iOS version (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch) of the games was released on September 27 by DotEmu.com and is available in the App Store. A version for Android was released on August 28, 2013, through the Google Play Store.

On November 21, 2013, DotEmu released also a &quot;Gold Edition&quot; for Windows on Steam. It adds improved user interface and inventory, advanced hint system, achievements, and cloud save support. It was released for macOS on March 17, 2015.

===Film adaptation===
On April 13, 2010, MTV&#x27;s Movies Blog posted an excerpt from a recent interview with Dutch film director Paul Verhoeven. In the interview, Verhoeven is quoted as saying, &quot;I am working on a movie now that is... situated in 1914. Basically, Indiana Jones-ish you could say, but also Hitchcockian.&quot; He also states that the source material is a video game, and that &quot;the writer of the video game has asked me to keep [the identity of the game] secret until he has a script.&quot; Subsequently, several other websites speculated that the video game in question is &quot;The Last Express&quot;, considering the relative dearth of games set in 1914, as well as Jordan Mechner&#x27;s work on the film version of &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;.

In October 2011, Verhoeven confirmed that he was working with Mechner to develop a film adaptation of the game. The film would most likely have been filmed in 3D, although it may not have been Verhoeven&#x27;s immediate next project. The film remains unfinished.

<doc id="654033" wikidata="Q6183081" url="?curid=654033" title="Jerri Manthey">
<text>Jerri Manthey (born September 5, 1970) is an American actress and television personality. She is perhaps best remembered as a polarizing figure from &quot;Survivor&quot;, on which she was a three-time contestant: she placed 8th on &quot;&quot;, she came 10th on &quot;&quot;, and was eliminated at the Final Four on &quot;&quot;.

== Early life ==
Jerri Manthey was born in Stuttgart, West Germany to American parents and attended both high school and college in Germany. Manthey&#x27;s father, Cyril, was a career member of the United States Army and served several years in Germany. In 1991, Manthey worked for Hooters at their Huntsville, Alabama restaurant before moving to their restaurant in Oklahoma City. She later appeared in the Summer 1992 edition of &quot;Hooters&quot; magazine with country singer Vince Gill. Manthey worked as a bartender in Los Angeles while attempting to build an acting career. In 1995, Manthey appeared in the music video for Def Leppard&#x27;s single &quot;When Love &amp; Hate Collide&quot;. She also appeared in a music video for Faith Hill&#x27;s cover of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;.

== &quot;Survivor&quot; ==
=== &quot;The Australian Outback&quot; ===

In 2001, Manthey appeared on the television reality show &quot;&quot;. At the beginning of the game, Manthey was initially sorted into the Ogakor tribe, where she formed multiple conflicts with her fellow tribemates, notably Keith Famie over his cooking skills, which put her on the initial chopping block; she was spared from an early elimination due to her tribe winning the first immunity challenge. 

After Ogakor lost the second immunity challenge, Manthey was targeted as her personality rubbed people the wrong way, yet she was spared after she accused Kel Gleason of having snuck beef jerky into the game and having the majority believing her and voting Gleason out. Manthey later confessed that she was attracted to tribemate Colby Donaldson, which she used to help her survive the next two tribal councils Ogakor attended.

On Day 19, the tribes merged into Barramundi after Michael Skupin&#x27;s evacuation left ten players in the game, five from each tribe. Anticipating a tied vote, Ogakor took advantage of Jeff Varner&#x27;s previous votes and targeted him, allowing Ogakor to vote him out and secure the majority over Kucha; the majority of five - Famie, Donaldson, Manthey, Tina Wesson and Amber Brkich - successfully eliminated Alicia Calaway from Kucha at the following tribal council.

With eight players remaining, Manthey and Brkich were told to target Elisabeth Filarski, but Donaldson, Famie and Wesson decided to turn on Manthey as she annoyed them and Ogakor would still have the majority, sending Manthey home on Day 27 as the second member of the jury in a 6-2 vote.

At the season&#x27;s final tribal council, Manthey voted for Wesson to win over Donaldson as she felt betrayed by the latter. Wesson would go on to win the season in a 4-3 vote.

=== &quot;All-Stars&quot; ===

In 2004, Manthey was cast in the show&#x27;s eighth season (the first to feature returning players), &quot;,&quot; where she started out on the Saboga tribe. Jenna Lewis, Tina Wesson, and Ethan Zohn. Manthey initially attempted to improve her game by not being overly opinionated; she nevertheless got into multiple arguments at the Saboga tribe camp, particularly with Rupert Boneham during a shelter-building challenge. Despite losing the first two immunity challenges, Manthey was spared from elimination as Tina Wesson, a past winner, and Rudy Boesch, who proved weak in challenges, were considered greater targets by the majority.

On Day 13, the tribes participated in a reward challenge where the tribe that finished last would be absorbed into the other two. Saboga lost, and Manthey and Ethan Zohn were drafted into the Mogo Mogo tribe. The new tribe lost the three following immunity challenges; Manthey surviving every tribal council thanks to aligning with van den Berghe and Vavrick-O&#x27;Brien to vote out larger threats in Richard Hatch, Colby Donaldson and Zohn.

On Day 22, at the final ten, an unexpected second switch left Manthey on the Chapera tribe, containing all her fellow former Mogo Mogo members in Vavrick-O&#x27;Brien, van den Berghe and Shii Ann Huang, and joined by former Chapera member, Amber Brkich. After Chapera lost the next immunity challenge, Manthey was initially confident she would be safe as Brkich was a strategic outsider on the tribe; however, a deal struck by van den Berghe and Mogo Mogo member Rob Mariano saved Brkich, eliminating Manthey in tenth place on Day 24 by a unanimous 4-1 blindside.

=== &quot;Heroes vs. Villains&quot; ===

Manthey competed for her third and final time on the show&#x27;s tenth anniversary and twentieth season, &quot;,&quot; as a member of the Villains tribe. Manthey initially formed a bond with Coach Wade, which fellow tribemates teased the two about being in love. The two found themselves in an early alliance with Tyson Apostol, Sandra Diaz-Twine, Courtney Yates and Rob Mariano, which was opposed by an alliance of Parvati Shallow, Danielle DiLorenzo and Russell Hantz. The Villains experienced an early winning streak in challenges.

When a hidden immunity idol sent Apostol home at a double tribal council, Manthey joined Shallow, DiLorenzo and Hantz&#x27;s alliance in voting out Mariano, Coach and Yates before the two tribes would merge.

The Heroes and Villains tribes, each consisting of five members, merged into the Yin Yang tribe on Day 25. Initially deadlocked in a 5-5 tied vote between respective targets Manthey and perceived Heroes tribe leader J.T. Thomas, to everyone&#x27;s surprise Shallow played two hidden immunity idols and saved Manthey. This allowed the Villains to eliminate Thomas and secure a majority, through which the Heroes&#x27; Amanda Kimmel and Candice Woodcock - the latter an accomplice in eliminating the former - were voted out consecutively.

With seven players remaining, Hantz targeted DiLorenzo as he felt she and Shallow were too close, with Manthey as the swing vote in the plan; Manthey joined in after DiLorenzo accidentally revealed that the former was at the bottom of the alliance. Rupert Boneham and Colby Donaldson, the last two Heroes remaining, were the next two players voted out. Hantz, winning the Day 38 final immunity challenge, successfully encouraged Diaz-Twine and Shallow to vote Manthey out due to the latter&#x27;s strong social game. In 4th place, Manthey was unanimously voted out 3-1, becoming the final member of the jury.

At the final tribal council, Manthey initially planned on voting for Hantz, but switched her vote to Shallow after her answer to Manthey&#x27;s jury question. Shallow would go on to lose in second place to Diaz-Twine in a 6-3-0 vote, making Diaz-Twine the show&#x27;s first two-time winner.

=== Post-&quot;Survivor&quot; fame ===
Following her appearance on &quot;Survivor&quot;, Manthey appeared on the reality shows &quot;Blind Date&quot;, &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; and &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot;.

== Modeling ==
Manthey posed nude in the September 2001 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. This was mentioned on the &quot;&quot; DVD&#x27;s deleted scene segment &quot;Chapera Mock Tribal Council&quot;, in which the Chapera tribe hosted a mock-up of Saboga&#x27;s first tribal council at their own camp.

== 2010 removal from air flight ==
On March 3, 2010, while &quot;&quot; was still being aired, Manthey was removed from a US Airways flight in Charlotte, North Carolina after a disagreement with the flight crew. She posted an open letter to US Airways management on her Facebook page sharing the details of her experience.

<text>Bethany College is a private liberal arts college in Bethany, West Virginia, United States. Founded in 1840 by minister Alexander Campbell of the Restoration Movement, who gained support by the Virginia legislature, Bethany College was the first institution of higher education in what is now West Virginia. The college has an enrollment of approximately 620 students.

==History==

A liberal arts college, Bethany was chartered on March 2, 1840, by the Virginia legislature and given &quot;all degree-granting powers&quot; of the University of Virginia. West Virginia&#x27;s secession from Virginia on June 20, 1863, recognized existing Virginia charters; Bethany College continues to operate under the Virginia charter.

It was founded by Alexander Campbell, a minister in the Restoration Movement who provided the land and funds for the first building and served as the first president. Bethany has been a four-year private liberal arts college affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), since its inception. This religious body, of which Campbell was one of the principal founders, continues to support and encourage the college but exercises no sectarian control. An early center of coeducation, Bethany has admitted women since the 1880s.

The college&#x27;s roots stem from the Buffalo Seminary, founded in 1818, by Campbell; sessions were first held in his mansion in Bethany, home of Alexander Campbell and his father Thomas Campbell. The new Buffalo Seminary, &quot; a continuing education arm of the College&quot; is less than a mile away from the College. 

The college is the birthplace of Delta Tau Delta, an international social fraternity founded in 1858.

During World War II, Bethany was one of 131 colleges nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

A number of campus buildings are contributing resources to the Bethany Historic District. The Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Pendleton Heights was listed in 1975 and the Delta Tau Delta Founders House in 1979.

The campus is also home to the Parkinson Forest, which in 2019 was added to the national Old-Growth Forest Network. The designation identifies the Parkinson Forest as the oldest Old-Growth Forest in Brooke County.

==Academics==

Bethany College offers a wide selection of studies, awarding Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degrees in more than 25 fields. If a major does not appeal to a student, Bethany offers students the opportunity to design their own major through the Interdisciplinary program. Bethany also offers dual majors, which is a combination of two majors.

According to recent research, 95% of Bethany College graduates carry student loan debt, averaging $25,704. The endowment fund in 2016 was worth $46.7 million. According to &quot;U.S. News&quot; tuition and fees are $28,444 and room and board costs $10,270 (2017–18). About 29% of Bethany students graduate in four years.

==Student life==
Bethany College has multiple opportunities for student engagement, ranging from sports to social events. The school has Men&#x27;s teams for baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field and volleyball. Women&#x27;s teams include many of the same sports as Men&#x27;s, with the addition of acrobatics &amp; tumbling, softball, wrestling and equestrian club. There is no Women&#x27;s team for baseball or football.

The main social event at the school is Homecoming Weekend, which takes place in October. This event is highly anticipated by both current and former students alike. Notable alumni visit the school to speak at seminars, the school hosts a special breakfast, fraternities and sororities hold their own events, and there are various sporting events.

<doc id="654037" wikidata="Q7380255" url="?curid=654037" title="Rupert Boneham">
<text>Rupert Frederick Boneham ( ; born January 27, 1964) is an American mentor for troubled teens who became known to reality television audiences in 2003 as a contestant on &quot;&quot;. He later appeared on the &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot; seasons of &quot;Survivor&quot;, placing fourth, sixth, and 20th, respectively. He was ultimately a fan favorite among &quot;Survivor&quot; viewers, who voted him a million-dollar winner on &quot;&quot;, a special episode of &quot;Survivor: All-Stars&quot;. The prize was awarded after a nationwide popular vote in which Boneham received 85% of the votes cast. Boneham and his wife Laura later competed on the 31st season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; and were the second team eliminated.

Boneham was the 2012 Libertarian nominee for governor of Indiana, losing to Republican nominee, and future Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
===&quot;Pearl Islands&quot;===
During &quot;&quot;, Boneham quickly became one of the most popular &quot;Survivor&quot; contestants, and was well known as a &quot;gentle giant&quot; for his distinctive appearance, which included a huge beard, tie-dye shirt and large size, as well as a boisterous, friendly-but-focused personality.

Boneham was a preselected member of the Drake tribe, before his arrival on the island for &quot;Survivor: Pearl Islands&quot;. For the first three episodes he was part of an alliance with Sandra Diaz-Twine, Christa Hastie, and Trish Dunn. In episode four, Boneham&#x27;s tribe lost immunity, but he was kidnapped by the Morgan tribe and did not attend Tribal Council. He temporarily looked after a wounded python he found named Balboa, who became the namesake of the merged tribe. In Episode Six, Drake lost their third immunity challenge, and Dunn conspired with Diaz-Twine, &quot;Jonny Fairplay&quot; Dalton, and Shawn Cohen to vote out Boneham, but he was saved by Diaz-Twine and Cohen, sending Dunn home instead. After the next Tribal Council when Cohen was voted out, Burton Roberts from Drake and Lillian &quot;Lil&quot; Morris from Morgan returned to the game, as part of the Outcast twist, and both joined the Drake alliance at the merge. After two Morgan members had been eliminated, Dalton, Roberts and Morris sided with Darrah Johnson and Tijuana &quot;Ti&quot; Bradley from the Morgan tribe and successfully voted Boneham out on Day 27, in a vote of 5–2–1. That night he became the tenth contestant voted out of the competition (eleventh overall) and the second member of the jury. On Day 39, Boneham cast his jury vote for Diaz-Twine, who would be named the winner of the season.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===
Less than a month after Boneham returned home from the competition, he returned to compete in the &quot;All-Stars&quot; season, the only player from &quot;Pearl Islands&quot; to do so, and thus the first contestant in &quot;Survivor&quot; history to compete in two consecutive seasons. Boneham went on to finish fourth, being voted out in Episode 15 and being the fifteenth person eliminated. After &quot;All-Stars&quot; ended a special aired called &quot;&quot;, in which viewers were given the opportunity in a contest called &quot;America Votes&quot; to select one of the 18 contestants to win one million dollars. The finalists were Boneham, Colby Donaldson, &quot;Big Tom&quot; Buchanan, and &quot;Boston Rob&quot; Mariano. Boneham won the million dollars, receiving 85% of the 38 million votes cast. He spent his prize money on his family&#x27;s debts, a college fund for his daughter, a new house for his family, and the creation of his charity, Rupert&#x27;s Kids, which mentors troubled children.

After &quot;All-Stars&quot; ended, he appeared in national promos for &quot;&quot;.  Boneham also made an appearance in the of the Israeli version of &quot;Survivor&quot; in September 2009 as a part of a reward in a reward challenge.

===&quot;Heroes vs. Villains&quot;===
Boneham returned to participate in the &quot;&quot; as part of the Heroes tribe. He was a part of the Heroes alliance which consisted of himself, J. T. Thomas, Amanda Kimmel, Cirie Fields, James Clement and Candice Woodcock. The alliance successfully eliminated Stephenie Lagrossa and Tom Westman, however, Fields was blindsided on Day 11, and they voted Clement out on Day 15 because his knee was injured. After Clement&#x27;s elimination, the Heroes were down to five members, however, they won the last three immunity challenges.

The tribes merged with ten players remaining: five Heroes and five Villains. The Heroes thought that Villain member Russell Hantz was on their side. However, Sandra Diaz-Twine warned Boneham that Hantz was not with them, which concerned Boneham. At Tribal Council, the Heroes voted against Villains member Jerri Manthey while the Villains voted against Thomas, However, Parvati Shallow used one of her hidden immunity idols on Diaz-Twine, and used another idol (originally Thomas&#x27;s immunity idol, which he gave to Hantz right before the merge, and which Hantz eventually gave to Shallow) on Manthey, whose votes were negated by the idol, therefore blindsiding Thomas and putting the Heroes in the minority. Woodcock flipped to the Villains alliance at the next Tribal Council so Kimmel was voted out. After Shallow won the next immunity challenge, Boneham put a rock in his pocket which made Hantz believe it was a hidden immunity idol. So the Villains decided to split their votes between Boneham and Woodcock. Due to Boneham and Colby Donaldson voting against Woodcock, she was blindsided thus sparing Boneham. He was spared again at the Final Seven Tribal Council, due to Hantz and Manthey siding with him to get rid of Danielle DiLorenzo.

After the loved ones challenge, Hantz plotted with Boneham and Donaldson to get rid of Shallow and they agreed. This plan was foiled when Shallow won immunity which surprised all three. At Tribal Council, Boneham and Donaldson voted for Diaz-Twine, but she used her hidden immunity idol, however, it only negated Boneham and Donaldson&#x27;s votes as they were the only one&#x27;s who voted against her. The four villains voted for Boneham thus eliminating him from the game. He was once again the fifteenth person eliminated, came in sixth place and was the seventh member of the jury. At the Final Tribal Council, Boneham, along with Courtney Yates and fellow Heroes tribemates Thomas, Kimmel, Woodcock, and Donaldson, voted for Diaz-Twine to win again, which she did by a 6–3–0 vote over Shallow and Hantz. At the reunion show, Boneham narrowly lost the fan favorite award to Hantz.

===&quot;Blood vs. Water&quot;===
Boneham and his wife Laura competed in the show&#x27;s 27th season, &quot;&quot;. This made him the second contestant in the history of the program to play the game four times, following Rob Mariano. On Day One, Laura was the first member of the Tadhana tribe to be voted out. However, Rupert traded places with her and sent himself to Redemption Island in her place in order to give Laura a chance at playing the game. This sacrifice allowed Laura to play the game on the Galang tribe. Rupert ultimately lost the first duel at Redemption on day four, and became the first person eliminated from &quot;Survivor: Blood vs. Water&quot;, finishing in 20th place.

==Other appearances==

Shortly after his &quot;Survivor&quot; appearances, Boneham briefly appeared at charity events sponsored by the Indiana Ice and Hardee&#x27;s. In 2004, he appeared as a stable hand named Paul in &quot;The Big My Little Pony Episode&quot;, the third-season premiere of the TV series &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;. In 2006, he appeared in the independent movie &quot;Open Mic&#x27;rs&quot;. He also made a cameo appearance as a homeless man in &quot;The Radford Reshuffle&quot;, the sixth-season premiere of the show &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;. Boneham also makes an appearance as an extra in the bar fight scene in &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot;.

In 2016, Boneham appeared in a special episode of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; which featured multiple former &quot;Survivor&quot; contestants competing on the show. The episode aired on May 23, 2016.

Boneham and his wife Laura competed on the 31st season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. They were the second team eliminated.

==Rupert&#x27;s Kids==
In 1983, before appearing on &quot;Survivor&quot;, Boneham worked with mentally handicapped children in Abilene, Texas. He then moved to Indiana to work with troubled young adults. In 1991, he purchased an abandoned house and converted it into a vocational training center for young adults who had been expelled from school.

After being awarded one million dollars on &quot;&quot;, Boneham used a large percentage of his winnings to establish Rupert&#x27;s Kids, to help &quot;at-risk teens&quot;. The organization joined with the City of Indianapolis to create the Park Adoption Program.

==2012 gubernatorial campaign==
On August 30, 2011, Boneham announced that he would consider running for governor of Indiana. He launched his campaign on October 22, declaring that he would seek the nomination of the Libertarian Party. He won their nomination and ran against Republican nominee Mike Pence and Democratic nominee John R. Gregg. Incumbent Republican governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited.

Boneham wrote on his official website, &quot;I have spent my entire adult life serving my community and I see an opportunity to make a difference for Indiana&quot;, referencing his troubled-youth charity, Rupert&#x27;s Kids. &quot;While surveying the current choices for our next Governor, I do not see anyone that has an understanding of what daily life is like for many Hoosiers nor anyone who appears to understand the harm that misguided government policies are doing to our communities. It is obvious that career politicians are not the answer because they are often the problem. I will be evaluating whether or not hardworking Hoosiers are ready for a new voice with new ideas.&quot; He states that he has been a Libertarian for more than 20 years, but did not become active in the party until 2012.

Boneham and running mate Brad Klopfenstein received 101,868 votes, 3.95 percent of the total.

==Personal life==
As of &quot;The Amazing Race 31&quot; in 2019, Rupert and Laura have been married for about 21 years, and have a daughter, Raya.

In 2021, Rupert revealed that he had undergone two surgeries for throat cancer.

<text>Gurney&#x27;s pitta (Hydrornis gurneyi) () is a medium-sized passerine bird. It breeds in the Malay Peninsula, with populations mainly in Myanmar. The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the British banker and amateur ornithologist John Henry Gurney (1819-1890). Its diet consists of slugs, insects, and earthworms.

==Taxonomy==
Gurney&#x27;s pitta was described by the amateur ornithologist Allan Octavian Hume in 1875 and given the binomial name &quot;Pitta gurneyi&quot;. The species was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Hydrornis&quot; based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2006. The genus &quot;Hydrornis&quot; had been introduced by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1843. The specific epithet was chosen to honour the amateur ornithologist John Henry Gurney (1819-1890).

==Description==
The male has a blue crown and black-and-yellow underparts; the rest of the head is black, and it has warm brown upperparts. The female has a brown crown and buffy-whitish underparts.

==Status and conservation==
Gurney&#x27;s pitta is endangered. It was initially thought to be extinct for some time after 1952, but was rediscovered in 1986. Its rarity has been caused by the clearance of natural forest in southern Burma and peninsular Thailand.

Its population was estimated at a mere nine pairs in 1997, then believed one of the rarest bird species on earth. A search for it in Burma in 2003 was successful and discovered that the species persisted at four sites with a maximum of 10-12 pairs at one location. This granted the species a reassessment from the IUCN, going from critically endangered to endangered. Later on, further research completed in Burma by 2009 provides strong evidence that its global population is much greater than previously estimated, owing to the discovery of several new territories in this country

The pitta was voted the &quot;most wanted bird in Thailand&quot; by bird watchers visiting that country.

A study conducted in 2016, led by scientist Nay Myo Shwe, visited 142 sites the pitta has been previously observed in Myanmar; it was only in 41 that any trace of the bird was found. It was estimated that more than 80% of the bird&#x27;s habitat was lost from 1999-2017, due to palm oil plantations; the IUCN subsequently re-assessed the species status as critically endangered. The pitta is considered functionally extinct in Thailand.

<text>Jonny Fairplay (born Jon Dalton, March 11, 1974) is an American former art consultant, professional wrestler, and reality television personality. He has twice competed on the reality competition TV show &quot;Survivor&quot;, coming in third place on the seventh season, &quot;&quot; and coming in last at twentieth place on the sixteenth season, &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Jon Dalton was born March 11, 1974, and is originally from Danville, Virginia. He attended George Washington High School, and subsequently attended Virginia Tech. After college, he moved to Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon, before settling in Los Angeles.

==Reality television==
===&quot;Survivor:&quot; &quot;Pearl Islands&quot;===
On &quot;&quot;, Dalton constructed what host Jeff Probst called &quot;the greatest lie in &quot;Survivor&quot; history.&quot; Prior to leaving for Panama to compete on the show, Dalton concocted a plan with a close friend of his named Dan, whom Dalton had designated to participate in a challenge that would involve contestants&#x27; loved ones. To generate sympathy for Dalton and give him an advantage in the game, Dan would dishonestly inform Dalton that his grandmother had died. In the season&#x27;s eleventh episode, Dan did so in front of the remaining competitors, who allowed a seemingly distraught Dalton to win the challenge in order to give him the opportunity to spend time with Dan and obtain more information about his grandmother&#x27;s alleged death. Though the remaining contestants would not discover the truth until after the season had completed filming, it was quickly revealed to the television audience that Dalton&#x27;s grandmother had not died but was, in fact, at home &quot;watching Jerry Springer&quot;. Dalton&#x27;s grandmother actually died on February 7, 2025 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Probst also publicly said:

===Danny Bonaduce altercation===
On October 2, 2007, at the &quot;Fox Reality Really Awards&quot;, Dalton was invited to present an award and was loudly booed by the audience while speaking on stage. Actor and political commentator Danny Bonaduce approached Dalton on stage and said, &quot;They&#x27;re booing because they hate you.&quot; As Bonaduce then began walking away, Dalton called to him to return, then Dalton leaped into his arms, wrapped his arms around Bonaduce, and held on, causing Bonaduce to react by flipping Dalton over his head and dropping him to the floor hard on his face. Dalton immediately left the stage, visibly bleeding from his face and allegedly losing a number of teeth.

In an interview with website TMZ soon after, Dalton stated that he had filed a police report over the incident and that authorities were waiting to review video of the incident before pressing battery charges against Bonaduce. On October 5, 2007, three days after the incident, Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Jeffrey Boxer announced that Bonaduce would not be facing charges, stating that there was &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; that Bonaduce&#x27;s actions were criminal. Boxer noted that Bonaduce&#x27;s actions &quot;fell within the realm of self-defense&quot;, as Dalton had initiated the physical conflict.

At the 2008 &quot;Fox Reality Really Awards&quot;, Dalton and Bonaduce appeared together onstage and joked about the previous year&#x27;s incident. In a scripted scene, Dalton kissed Bonaduce on the lips, and Bonaduce subsequently spit an object out of his mouth which he joked was another one of Dalton&#x27;s teeth.

===&quot;Survivor: Micronesia&quot;===
On January 3, 2008, it was announced that Fairplay was the only pre-&quot;&quot; castaway who accepted an offer to join the tribe of returning contestants in &quot;&quot;, the show&#x27;s 16th season. However, Fairplay asked his tribe to vote him off in the first episode so that he could return to his pregnant girlfriend.

===Subsequent &quot;Survivor&quot; appearances===
Fairplay did not participate in &quot;&quot; in 2010. When asked about the reason for this, Jeff Probst remarked, &quot;The reason that Fairplay isn&#x27;t here is that this season is called &quot;Heroes vs. Villains&quot;, not &quot;Survivor Quitters&quot;.&quot; Fairplay acknowledged in a 2010 interview that there is animosity between himself and Probst, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s no secret that Jeff Probst hates me, and I don&#x27;t go out of my way to be his friend either.&quot;

In 2013, Fairplay was inducted into the Xfinity &quot;&quot;Survivor&quot; Hall of Fame,&quot; alongside Kim Spradlin and John Cochran. Fairplay was the only non-winner inducted into the Class of 2013.

===Other appearances===
Dalton and his wife Michelle appeared on &quot;The Celebrity Newlywed Game&quot;, on which he beat the Monkees&#x27; Davy Jones and his wife; as well as on &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; in an episode titled &#x27;Reality TV Stars&#x27; Real Life Drama&#x27; . He has also appeared on &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Fear Factor&quot;, &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;, and &quot;Camp Reality&quot;.

Dalton is also under contract with Wizard World to appear at its comic book conventions.

On March 29, 2022, he appeared as a plaintiff on &quot;Judge Steve Harvey&quot; against wrestling promoter Ronnie Gossett.

In May 2023, Fairplay competed as a celebrity tribe captain in the second season of the NMB Celebrity Survivor Challenge. He was the 3rd person voted out of the game, placing 13th.

In 2023, he participated in the reality competition show &quot;House of Villains&quot; on E!, finishing in fourth place

==Professional wrestling==
Dalton started in professional wrestling in 1998 in North Carolina and then moved to Oregon where, as Jonny Fairplay, he started his own promotion, New Dimension Wrestling (not to be confused with a similarly named Carolinas&#x27; promotion with which he claimed to be affiliated). There he served as promoter and commentator. During this time, he also ran his own weekly online professional wrestling radio talk show, having various wrestlers on as guest commentators. He worked as a personal assistant for the professional wrestler &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper for a year and a half prior to &quot;Survivor&quot;.

After his first &quot;Survivor&quot; appearance, Dalton was signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he appeared under the Jonny Fairplay moniker. In mid January, promo began airing hyping his debut in the company. He made his debut on January 21, but was interrupted by A.J. Styles. The two feuded for several weeks, and on February 25, Fairplay brought in Lex Luger to get revenge on Styles and cost him the NWA World Tag Team Championship. He made brief, non-wrestling appearances in 2005 at both Final Resolution and Destination X.

On October 7, 2006, Fairplay was defeated by Molly Holly after a low blow and quick pin fall at a WCWA event. One month later, Fairplay and the Hardkore Kidd defeated Frankie Kazarian. Dalton also made an appearance in Ring of Honor, an American professional wrestling promotion, on March 31, 2007, in Detroit, Michigan.

On April 1, 2011, Fairplay made an appearance for Dragon Gate USA, endorsing Jimmy Rave as the promotion&#x27;s next breakout star. After Rave was defeated in a match by Arik Cannon, Fairplay entered the ring, confronted Cannon and got on the receiving end of his finishing maneuver, &quot;Total Anarchy&quot;.

On May 3, 2011, Jonny Fairplay appeared on the debut televised event of WFX Wrestling in a backstage scene in which he swindled U-Gene out of pocket money with a trick reminiscent of his famous &quot;Survivor&quot; lie. The following week Fairplay convinced U-Gene to sign a contract making Fairplay his &#x27;manager slash best friend&#x27; promising to make him the biggest star in reality television. On the third episode of &quot;Overload&quot;, Fairplay is overheard by U-Gene while bragging about having stole all of his money. After chasing Fairplay to ringside, U-Gene was physically attacked by Fairplay before he revealed he had used his money to help male bodybuilder and former &quot;Big Brother&quot; contestant Jessie Godderz join the roster of &quot;WFX&quot;.

Starting in May 2014, Fairplay has appeared in the West Coast Wrestling Connection as the on-screen manager of Ashton Vuitton.

==Personal life==
, Dalton lives in his native Danville, Virginia.

Dalton and his girlfriend, Michelle Deighton, a contestant from &quot;WWE Tough Enough&quot; 2011 and the fourth season of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, had a daughter born in 2008, and lived in Providence, North Carolina. Dalton announced that he was separating from Deighton on June 28, 2011, via Twitter.

Dalton and girlfriend Caryn Finkbeiner had a baby daughter on May 20, 2017.

On December 18, 2020, Dalton and his mother Patsy Hall were arrested on larceny charges. According to the Danville, Virginia Police Department&#x27;s report, they were accused of stealing jewelry and furniture valued at $5,000 from Dalton&#x27;s grandmother, Jean Cook, following a criminal complaint filed by Dalton&#x27;s disgruntled aunt. Charges against both people were dismissed due to insufficient evidence on March 25, 2021.

<text>Deportation of the Kalmyks, codename Operation Ulusy () was the Soviet deportation of more than 93,000 people of Kalmyk nationality, and non-Kalmyk women with Kalmyk husbands, on 28–31 December 1943. Families and individuals were forcibly relocated in cattle wagons to special settlements for forced labor in Siberia. Kalmyk women married to non-Kalmyk men were exempted from the deportations. The government&#x27;s official reason for the deportation was an accusation of Axis collaboration during World War II based on the approximately 5,000 Kalmyks who fought in the Nazi-affiliated Kalmykian Cavalry Corps. The government refused to acknowledge that more than 23,000 Kalmyks served in the Red Army and fought against Axis forces at the same time.
NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria and his deputy commissar Ivan Serov implemented the forced relocation on direct orders from Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. Up to 10,000 servicemen from the NKVD-NKGB troops participated in the deportation. It was part of the Soviet forced settlement program and population transfers that affected several million Soviet citizens from ethnic minority groups between the 1930s and the 1950s. The specific targeting of Kalmyks was based on a number of factors, including the group&#x27;s alleged anti-communist sentiment and Buddhist culture.

The deportation contributed to more than 16,000 deaths, resulting in a 17% mortality rate for the deported population. The Kalmyks were rehabilitated in 1956 after Nikita Khrushchev became the new Soviet Premier and undertook a process of de-Stalinization. In 1957, the Kalmyks were released from special settlements and allowed to return to their home region, which was formalized as the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. By 1959, more than 60% of the remaining Kalmyks had returned home. The loss of life and socioeconomic upheaval of the deportations, however, had a profound impact on the Kalmyks that is still felt today. On 14 November 1989 the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union declared all of Stalin&#x27;s deportations &quot;illegal and criminal&quot;. Contemporary historical analyses consider these deportations an example of persecution and a crime against humanity.

==Background==

In the 1630s, several Oirat tribes from the west Mongolia and Dzungaria regions migrated further west, settling along the Volga river and eventually becoming a differentiated ethnic group called the Kalmyks. The Kalmyks spoke a Mongolian dialect and practiced Tibetan Buddhism.

The Kalmyks became part of the Russian Empire and during the subsequent Russian Civil War, many of them fought with the anti-communist White Russian army. When the Bolsheviks prevailed, many Kalmyks left Russia in 1920, with a significant proportion emigrating to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. The Kalmyks who remained in the newly formed Soviet Union resisted the collectivization process of its agricultural and herding practices in the 1920s, forming guerrilla groups that continued to fight until 1926.

In the 1920s, Joseph Stalin emerged as the new General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Ben Kiernan, an American academic and historian, described Stalin&#x27;s era as &quot;by far the bloodiest of Soviet, or even Russian history&quot;. In the 1930s, the Soviet government initiated an anti-religious campaign against Kalmyk Buddhism. Of the 175 Buddhist temples registered in the Russian Empire in 1917, all were destroyed by 1940. In 1935, the Soviet government established the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with Elista serving as the capital. According to the 1939 Soviet census, 131,271 Kalmyks were registered in the USSR. An alternative source lists 134,400 Kalmyks during that time.

In September and October 1937, around 172,000 Soviet Koreans were deported, making it the first instance of Stalin&#x27;s policy of resettling an entire nationality.

During World War II, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. On 26 August 1942, Nazi forces captured Elista in Kalmykia and soon after established the Kalmykian Cavalry Corps, consisting of approximately 5,000 men under the leadership of former intelligence officer Dr. Rudolf Otto Doll. The Corps fought against the Red Army, Soviet partisans, and protected Kalmyk livestock from Soviet forces. At the same time, 23,540 Kalmyks served in the Red Army and eight were ultimately awarded recognition as Heroes of the Soviet Union. Thus, Kalmyks fought on both sides in World War II. Around a quarter of the Kalmyk population fled across the Volga river to escape the German occupation. The fighting resulted in the destruction of many buildings and widespread looting, with total damages in the region estimated to be as high as 1,070,324,789 Rbls. When the German forces withdrew, many Kalmyks evacuated with them. The Red Army recaptured Elista on 31 December 1942. Once back under Soviet control, the Kalmyks were accused of being disloyal and fighting alongside Axis forces.

==Deportation==
During World War II, eight ethnic groups were expelled from their native lands by the Soviet government: the Volga Germans, the Chechens, the Ingush, the Balkars, the Karachays, the Crimean Tatars, the Meskhetian Turks, and the Kalmyks. Approximately 650,000 people were deported from the Caucasus region in 1943 and 1944 and a total of 3,332,589 people were deported during the entire war.

Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet secret police, championed the Kalmyk deportation, stating that the Kalmyks were &quot;unreliable&quot;. The decision was formally advanced by the State Defense Committee and approved by Stalin in October 1943. On 27 October 1943, NKVD deputy Ivan Serov arrived in Elista to begin preparations for the mass deportation. He met local party members at the office of the former First Secretary of the Kalmyk Communist Party and announced that the Kalmyks would be deported. When asked for the reason, Serov stated that it was because the Kalmyks &quot;left the front and joined the Germans&quot;. That same month, NKVD deputy V.V. Chernyshov held a meeting in Moscow with NKVD representatives from Altai, Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Novosibirsk to discuss the resettlement of the Kalmyks to these areas. The Kalmyk region, including its largest town of Elista, was divided into several operative districts. An NKVD operative was assigned to each district and required to develop plans to carry out the deportations, including mapping railway routes and identifying the number of trucks and soldiers necessary.

On 27 December, the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formally abolished by the Soviet government. Parts of its former territory were assigned to Astrakhan, Stalingrad, Rostov, Stavropol, and Dagestan. The former capital of Elista was renamed to Stepnoy. Resolution No. 1432 425 of the Soviet of People&#x27;s Commissars, formally determining the resettlement of the Kalmyks, was adopted on 28 December 1943. It was signed by Vyacheslav Molotov but not made public.

On the morning of 28 December 1943, NKVD agents entered the homes of the Kalmyks and announced the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, requiring the immediate deportation of Kalmyks to Siberia. The Decree included formal accusations of Nazi collaboration, anti-Soviet acts, and terrorism. The Kalmyks were given 12 hours to pack their belongings. They were allowed to carry up to of property per family, and multiple families had to share space in one truck. Soviet soldiers searched the Kalmyk houses and confiscated firearms, anti-Soviet literature, and foreign currency. Every person of Kalmyk ethnicity, including women, children and the elderly, were loaded onto trucks and sent to nearby railway stations. Only non-Kalmyks and Kalmyk women married to men of ethnic groups, not subject to deportation, were allowed to stay. Soviet forces surrounded Kalmyk settlements from the outset to prevent any potential resistance. At the start of the deportation, 750 Kalmyks were arrested as &quot;gang members&quot; or &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot;.

The Soviet government initially employed 4,421 NKVD agents, 1,226 soldiers, and 1,355 trucks as part of the operation. This number increased to 10,000 servicemen from the NKVD-NKGB troops, diverted from the Eastern Front. State Security Major General Markeyev, the Ivanovo Oblast NKVD Chief, oversaw the deportation.

The deportation was given the code name &quot;Operation Ulusy&quot; and affected 93,139 Kalmyks, including 26,359 families. Only three Kalmyk families avoided deportation. The operation proceeded as planned, with no security incidents reported. The Kalmyks were packed into cattle carts and loaded onto 46 east-bound trains. They were sent on a journey to remote areas of over a thousand miles away. One witness recalled that they traveled for two weeks, with no opportunity to practice basic hygiene. Another witness described that the children slept on the bunks, while the grown ups slept on the floor of the wagons. They made a hole on the floor, placed suitcases around it and used it as a toilet. Meals were available, though only once per day. Some deportees shared their food during the long transit. The trains would occasionally stop to release the people inside, though only for a short amount of time. The deportation was completed on 31 December. A majority of them (91,919) were deported by the end of the year, though an additional 1,014 people were also evicted in January 1944. The entire operation was guided by Beria and Serov. Other officials who participated in it included Victor Grigorievich Nasedkin, Head of the Gulag and Commissar of the State Security of the 3rd degree, and Dmitri Vasilevich Arkadiev, the Head of the Transport Department of the USSR NKVD. The Kalmyks were sent to various locations in Siberia—by January 1944, 24,352 had been sent to the Omsk Oblast, 21,164 to Krasnoyarsk Krai, 20,858 to Altai Krai, and 18,333 to Novosibirsk Oblast. Alternative sources indicate that, beginning in 1944, 6,167 Kalmyk families were in the Altai, 7,525 in the Krasnoyarsk, 5,435 in Novosibirsk and 8,353 in the Omsk Region. 660 families were also located in the Tomsk Region, 648 in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, 522 in Tobolsk, 2,796 in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and 1,760 in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug.

Historian Nikolay Bugay described the deportation as involving four distinct stages: (1) deportations in the Kalmyk region; (2) deportations in the Rostov Region; (3) deportations in the Stalingrad region; and (4) deportations of active duty Kalmyks serving in the Red Army. The final stage took place between 1944 and 1948, and involved not only Kalmyks, but also the Karaychs, Meskhetian Turks, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, Ingush and Balkars serving in the Red Army — all were discharged and exiled to the special settlements. Ethnic Russians were settled in the previously Kalmyk areas, changing their identity.

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued a decree on 26 November 1948, titled &quot;On Criminal Accountability for Escapes from Places of Compulsory and Permanent Settlement by Persons Exiled to Remote Regions of the Soviet Union during the Period of the Great Patriotic War&quot;. The decree formally stated that all deported ethnic groups must remain in permanent exile.

==Exile and death toll==
The Kalmyks were placed under the administration of the special settlements. These settlements provided forced labor for underdeveloped and inhospitable regions of the Soviet Union. Deportees routinely worked twelve hours a day, seven days a week. They suffered from exhaustion, cold, and hunger, with food rations tied to work quotas.

Upon arrival at the camps, male and female deportees were separated, washed, and forced to line up outside in the winter cold. Living conditions were minimal and cramped, with many having to share beds and sleep on the floor. 45,985 Kalmyk deportees were registered as laborers, including 28,107 in the agriculture sector, 1,632 in the mining and gold extraction industry, 784 in coal mining, and 259 in the timber industry.

Of the 93,139 deported Kalmyks, approximately 1,400 died in transit and a similar number became gravely ill. Hunger, cold, work conditions, and infections resulted in many additional fatalities at the forced labor camps. Soviet sources indicate that 83,688 Kalmyks were registered in the special settlements as of early 1945, meaning that more than 13,000 people had died or disappeared in the first two years of the deportation. In 1945, 3,735 Kalmyk children died (a 9.3 percent mortality rate) while only 351 Kalmyk children were born.

Official Soviet archives recorded approximately 16,000 deaths among the deported Kalmyks, a more than 17% mortality rate. Unofficial NKVD estimates placed the mortality rate even higher, at 19%.

Of the ethnic groups subjected to forced deportation by Soviet authorities, the Kalmyks suffered the greatest relative losses. The 1959 census listed 106,100 Kalmyks, down from 134,400 as of the 1939 census, meaning a more than 20% decline within a single generation.

==Rehabilitation, return and legacy==
On 13 December 1953, a Kalmyk delegation headed by Djab Naminov-Burkhinov lodged a formal complaint with the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld. After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev started a process of de-Stalinization, reversing many of previous policies. In his secret speech on 24 February 1956, Khrushchev condemned the ethnic deportations:
In August 1953, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union overturned the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1948, which ordered that all the evicted ethnic groups must remain in permanent exile. The Kalmyks were officially released from special settlement supervision on 17 March 1956. On 9 January 1957, a Soviet decree established the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast and on 29 July 1958, it officially became the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. 

By 1959, more than 60% of deported Kalmyks had returned to their home region. Even though 72,665 persons returned by that year, there were still 33,401 of them outside Kalmykia. By 1989, nearly 85% of Soviet Kalmyks resided in Kalmykia. However, the deportations permanently altered the ethnic composition of the region, reducing the number of ethnic Kalmyks in the population from 75% in 1926 to 45% in 1989. A record low was in 1959 when the Kalmyks made up only 35% of the population. Conversely, the share of Russians in Kalmykia increased from 10.7% in 1926 to 55.9%. Many Kalmyks were grateful to Khrushchev for restoring their lands, and a street in Elista was named in his honor.

On 14 November 1989 the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union declared all of Stalin&#x27;s deportations &quot;illegal and criminal&quot;. On 26April 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, under its chairman Boris Yeltsin, followed suit and passed the law &quot;On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples&quot; with Article 2 denouncing all mass deportations as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s policy of defamation and genocide&quot;. Russian historian Pavel Polian considered all the deportations of entire ethnic groups during Stalin&#x27;s era, including those from the Caucasus, a crime against humanity.

Historian Alexander Nekrich concluded that, while there were some Kalmyks who collaborated with Nazi Germany, &quot;the majority of Kalmyks not only remained loyal to the system but fought to defend it, arms in hands&quot;. Professor Brian Glyn Williams concluded that the deportation of the Meskhetian Turks, in spite of their lands never coming close to the scene of combat during World War II and which coincided with the deportation of other ethnic groups from Caucasus and Crimea, lends the strongest evidence that all the deportations were a part of a larger concealed Soviet foreign policy rather than a response to any &quot;universal mass treason&quot;. Scholar Nelly Bekus assumes that one of the motivations for the Soviet forced transfer was the Russification of these areas. Historians Hugo Service and Curtis Richardson described the deportation as an example of Soviet &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;, with Service opining it aimed to &quot;stigmatize particular ethnic groups as posing a special danger to the Soviet state&quot;

In its 1991 report, Human Rights Watch described all of the Soviet mass deportations as a form of collective punishment since groups were targeted on the basis of their ethnicity. It also noted that none of these ethnic groups were given any kind of compensation for the harm caused by the deportations. Social anthropologist Valeriya Gazizova similarly concluded that the Kalmyks were subject to Soviet persecution.

On 28 December 1996, sculptor Ernst Neizvestny unveiled his monument to the deported Kalmyks in Elista, titled &quot;Exile and Return&quot;, a bronze sculpture around high. In 2012, over 1,800 Kalmyks filed a request for compensation from the government as victims of the deportation. The Elista City Court rejected their application.

<text>Mateo Romero (ca. 1575 – 1647) was a Belgian-born Spanish composer of Baroque music and master of the royal chapel.

==Biography==
Romero was born as Mathieu Rosmarin in Liège, Belgium, and, following the early death of his father was, like many children from the then-Spanish Netherlands, recruited as a child to serve as a choir boy at the Madrid court. Between 1586 and 1593 he was taught in Spain by his countrymen George de la Hèle and Philippe Rogier. He took the name Romero in 1594. In 1598 he was &quot;maestro de capilla&quot; at the Spanish court of Philip II of Spain and Philip III of Spain. He remained in this position till 1634. In 1609 he was ordained a priest and was private chaplain to Philipp III. He was also secretary of the Order of the Golden Fleece.

After the death of Philip, he was also chaplain to King John IV of Portugal.

Romero was one of the most appreciated composers of his time; he was known as &quot;El Maestro Capitan&quot;. His service extended over the threshold of two musical eras, the Renaissance and Baroque. Although he was not part of the polyphonic school of the great Franco-Flemish school, he played an important role in the introduction of Italian &quot;stile moderno&quot; in Spain.

Most of his works, which were stored in the Royal Library in Lisbon, were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755.

<text>The fifth USS &quot;Eagle&quot; served in the United States Navy from 1898 to 1919, and saw action in the Spanish–American War and service during World War I.

&quot;Eagle&quot;, a yacht, was built in 1890 as Almy by Harlan and Hollingsworth, Wilmington, Delaware; purchased by the Navy on 2 April 1898 and renamed Eagle; and commissioned three days later, Lieutenant William Henry Hudson Southerland in command.

==Service history==

===Spanish–American War===
&quot;Eagle&quot; sailed from New York on 17 April 1898 for duty with the North Atlantic Squadron on blockade and dispatch duty in Cuban waters. On 29 June, she shelled the Spanish battery at Rio Honda and on 12 July captured the Spanish merchantman &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;. &quot;Eagle&quot; returned to Norfolk on 22 August to be fitted out for surveying duty, her principal employment through the remainder of her naval service. She compiled new charts and corrected existing ones for the waters surrounding Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Haiti.

===Pre-World War I===
Troubled conditions throughout the Caribbean often interrupted &quot;Eagle&quot;″s surveying duty and she gave varied service in protecting American interests. She patrolled off Haiti in January–February 1908 and again in November and December and off Nicaragua in December 1909. In June 1912, she transported Marines to Santiago de Cuba and Siboney to protect American lives and property during a rebellion in Cuba, and continued to investigate conditions and serve as base ship for the Marines until 1914. She also had gunboat duty with a cruiser squadron during the Haiti operation of July 1915 – March 1916, and was commended by the Secretary of the Navy for her creditable performance of widely varied duty. She then remained off Haiti to conduct surveys.

===World War I===
With American entry into World War I, &quot;Eagle&quot; returned to Cuban waters. She was attached to American Patrol Detachment, Atlantic Fleet, and throughout 1917–1918 was continually on patrol off Cuba, Santo Domingo, and the southern coast of the United States. From Key West, Florida, where she arrived on 3 April 1918, she patrolled the Florida Straits and after the end of the war operated on target practice, and tactical exercises and maneuvers. From 7 January – 15 March 1919, she made a cruise to Cuban ports and along the Gulf coast before being detached from the American Patrol Detachment on 28 April. &quot;Eagle&quot; left Key West the following day for Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was decommissioned there on 23 May and sold on 3 January 1920.

<doc id="654077" wikidata="Q1273226" url="?curid=654077" title="Ridgway's hawk">
<text>Ridgway&#x27;s hawk (Buteo ridgwayi) is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae endemic to the island of Hispaniola (both Haiti and the Dominican Republic) in the Caribbean. It is classified as Critically Endangered because of habitat destruction and human persecution in the Dominican Republic; however, due to conservation efforts, the population is now increasing.

It is named in honour of the ornithologist Robert Ridgway.

==Description==
&quot;B. ridgwayi&quot; is a medium-sized, compact hawk, measuring 36–41 cm long. The adult has brown-grey upperparts and greyish barred underparts, with a reddish-brown wash, rufous-tinged thighs, and a black-and-white barred tail. The male is greyer than the female, and the legs and the base of bill are yellow.

==Diet and breeding==
Ridgway&#x27;s hawk feeds on rodents, bats, centipedes, birds, anoles, skinks, frogs, and snakes. It nests in the crowns of tall trees, such as &quot;Roystonea borinquena&quot;, with nest-building in December through June, and egg-laying in January to June. The clutch size is 1 to 3 eggs. Most pairs raise 1 to 2 young, though 3 have been reported.

==Distribution==
Ridgway&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s original breeding range included all of the island of Hispaniola and some of the adjacent isles and keys, such as Gonâve Island, Île-à-Vache, Tortuga, Beata Island, and Alto Velo Island. However, it has since been extirpated from a large area of the Dominican Republic and almost all of Haiti, due to extensive deforestation and loss of habitat there. It was thought to be completely extirpated from all of Haiti; however, recent expeditions to the islands of Les Cayemites discovered a breeding population there. In the Dominican Republic, the only known surviving populations outside of reintroductions is in and around Los Haitises National Park, and a relict population in the Samaná Peninsula.

==Conservation==
This bird is described as critically endangered, due to clearance of its forest habitat and persecution by local farmers, who claim that the species preys upon their domestic fowl. Conservationists have countered that poultry is nothing more than a minor element of their diet, and that the Ridgway&#x27;s hawk has a highly varied prey base, with reptiles comprising up to 90% of its diet. Electrocution from power poles and nestling parasitism by &quot;Philornis pici&quot; flies are also reasons for population decline. Reintroductions in the Ecological Center of the Puntacana Resort and Club in La Altagracia Province have proven successful; 25 individuals were also released in Aniana Vargas National Park in Sánchez Ramírez Province, with more releases planned. It is proposed that a &quot;Ridgway&#x27;s Hawk Day&quot; should become a national holiday in the Dominican Republic, in order for the species to become more publicly known and protected.

<text>The World Air Sports Federation (&quot;Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&quot;) is the world governing body for air sports, and also stewards definitions regarding human spaceflight. It was founded on 14 October 1905, and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland. It maintains world records for aeronautical activities, including ballooning, aeromodeling, and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), as well as flights into space.

== History ==
The FAI was founded at a conference held in Paris 12–14 October 1905, which was organized following a resolution passed by the Olympic Congress held in Brussels on 10 June 1905 calling for the creation of an Association &quot;to regulate the sport of flying, ... the various aviation meetings and advance the science and sport of Aeronautics.&quot; The conference was attended by representatives from 8 countries: Belgium (, founded 1901), France (Aéro-Club de France, 1898), Germany ( aka &quot;German Airship League&quot;, founded 1902), Great Britain (Royal Aero Club, 1901), Italy (, 1904), Spain (, 1905), Switzerland (Aero-Club der Schweiz, 1900) and the United States (Aero Club of America, 1905).

On 2 February 2017 the FAI announced its new strategic partnership with international asset management firm Noosphere Ventures. FAI Secretary General Susanne Schödel, FAI President Frits Brink and Noosphere Ventures Managing Partner Max Polyakov signed the agreement, making Noosphere Ventures FAI&#x27;s Global Technical Partner.

The FAI suspended Russia and Belarus due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, as a result of which pilots from Russia and Belarus will not be able to compete in any FAI-sanctioned event in the 13 FAI air sports disciplines, including paragliding, hang gliding, and paramotoring.

== FAI General Conference ==
The 117th FAI General Conference took place in Dayton, Ohio, US (the &#x27;Birthplace of Aviation&#x27;) on 26 and 27 October 2023. 

The 118th FAI General Conference was held from 20 to 21 November 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The 119th FAI General Conference will take place in Vantaa, Finland from 22 to 24 October 2025.

== Activities ==
The FAI is the international governing body for the following activities: 
* Aerobatics through the FAI Aerobatics Commission (Commission Internationale de Voltige Aérienne – CIVA)
* Aeromodeling and drones through the FAI Aeromodelling Commission (Commission Internationale d&#x27;Aéro-Modélisme – CIAM)
* Ballooning through the FAI Ballooning Commission (Commission Internationale de l&#x27;Aérostation – CIA)
* General aviation through the FAI General Aviation Commission (General Aviation Commission – GAC)
* Gliding through the FAI Gliding Commission (International Gliding Commission – IGC)
* Hang gliding &amp; Paragliding through the FAI Hang Gliding &amp; Paragliding Commission (Commission Internationale de Vol Libre – CIVL)
* Human-powered aircraft through the FAI Amateur-Built and Experimental Aircraft Commission (Commission Internationale des Aéronefs de Construction Amateur – CIACA)
* Microlighting and Paramotoring through the FAI Microlight &amp; Paramotor Commission (Commission Internationale de Microaviation – CIMA)
* Skydiving through the FAI International Skydiving Commission
* Rotorcraft through the FAI Rotorcraft Commission (Commission Internationale de giraviation – CIG)

The FAI establishes the standards for records in the activities. Where these are air sports, the FAI also oversees international competitions at world and continental levels, and also organizes the World Air Games and FAI World Grand Prix.

The FAI organises the FAI International Drones Conference and Expo. This event offers a platform for organisations, businesses and individuals to discuss how drones are used today and to create a framework for how they will be used and impact on life in the future.

The FAI also keeps records set in human spaceflight, through the FAI Astronautic Records Commission (International Astronautic Records Commission – ICARE)

=== Kármán Line definition ===

The FAI defines the limit between Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and outer space, the so-called Karman Line, as the altitude of above Earth&#x27;s sea level.

== Records ==

Among the FAI&#x27;s responsibilities are the verification of record-breaking flights. For a flight to be registered as a &quot;World Record,&quot; it has to comply with the FAI&#x27;s strict rules, which include a proviso that the record must exceed the previous record by a certain percentage. Since the late 1930s, military aircraft have dominated some classes of record for powered aircraft such as speed, distance, payload, and height, though other classes are regularly claimed by civilians.

Some records are claimed by countries as their own, even though their achievements fail to meet FAI standards. These claims are not typically granted the status of official records. For example, Yuri Gagarin earned recognition for the first manned spaceflight, despite failing to meet FAI requirements. The FAI initially did not recognize the achievement because he did not land in his Vostok spacecraft (he ejected from it), but later it recognized that Gagarin was the first human to fly into space. The FAI then established the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal, which has been awarded since 1968.

<text>António Lobo Antunes (; born 1 September 1942) is a Portuguese novelist and retired medical doctor. He has been named as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He has been awarded the 2000 Austrian State Prize, the 2003 Ovid Prize, the 2005 Jerusalem Prize, the 2007 Camões Prize, and the 2008 Juan Rulfo Prize.

==Life and career==
António Lobo Antunes was born in Lisbon as the eldest of six sons of João Alfredo de Figueiredo Lobo Antunes (born 1915), prominent neurologist and professor, close collaborator of António Egas Moniz, Nobel Prize winner in physiology, and wife Maria Margarida Machado de Almeida Lima (born 1917). He is the brother of João Lobo Antunes and Manuel Lobo Antunes. 

At the age of seven, he decided to be a writer, but when he was 16, his father sent him to the medical school of the University of Lisbon. He graduated as a medical doctor, later specializing in psychiatry. During this time he never stopped writing.

By the end of his education, Lobo Antunes had to serve with the Portuguese Army to take part in the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974). In a military hospital in Angola, he became interested in the subjects of death and &quot;the other.&quot;

Lobo Antunes came back from Africa in 1973. The Angolan War of Independence was the subject of many of his novels. He worked for many months in Germany and Belgium.

In 1979, Lobo Antunes published his first novel, &quot;Memória de Elefante&quot; (Elephant&#x27;s Memory), in which he told the story of his separation. Due to the success of his first novel, Lobo Antunes decided to devote his evenings to writing. He has been practising psychiatry as well, mainly at the outpatients&#x27; unit at the Hospital Miguel Bombarda of Lisbon.

His style is considered to be very dense, heavily influenced by William Faulkner and Louis-Ferdinand Céline, and his books also tend to be on the long side.

He has published more than twenty novels, among the most important are &quot;Fado Alexandrino&quot; (1983), &quot;As Naus&quot; (1988) and &quot;O Manual dos Inquisidores&quot; (1996). His works have been translated into more than thirty languages.

He writes a biweekly newspaper column for &quot;Visão&quot;, a Portuguese magazine.

He was granted the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint James of the Sword.

==Personal life==
He married his first wife Maria José Xavier da Fonseca e Costa (1946–1999), the second of three daughters of José Hermano da Costa and his wife Clara da Conceição de Barros Xavier da Fonseca e Costa, by whom he has two daughters: Maria José Lobo Antunes in 1971 and Joana Lobo Antunes in 1973. They were divorced.

His second wife (whom he also divorced) was Maria João Espírito Santo Bustorff Silva (born Lisbon, 13 August 1950), daughter of António Sérgio Carneiro Bustorff Silva and wife Ana Maria da Anunciação de Fátima de Morais Sarmento Cohen do Espírito Santo Silva, by whom she has one daughter: Maria Isabel Bustorff Lobo Antunes (born 1983).

He was married for the third time in 2010 to Cristina Ferreira de Almeida, daughter of João Carlos Ferreira de Almeida (Lisbon, 1941 – 2008) and wife Natércia Ribeiro da Silva.

<doc id="654092" wikidata="Q937854" url="?curid=654092" title="Diving bell">
<text>A diving bell is a rigid chamber used to transport divers from the surface to depth and back in open water, usually for the purpose of performing underwater work. The most common types are the open-bottomed wet bell and the closed bell, which can maintain an internal pressure greater than the external ambient. Diving bells are usually suspended by a cable, and lifted and lowered by a winch from a surface support platform. Unlike a submersible, the diving bell is not designed to move under the control of its occupants, or to operate independently of its launch and recovery system.

The wet bell is a structure with an airtight chamber which is open to the water at the bottom, that is lowered underwater to operate as a base or a means of transport for a small number of divers. Air is trapped inside the bell by pressure of the water at the interface. These were the first type of diving chamber, and are still in use in modified form.

The closed bell is a pressure vessel for human occupation, which may be used for bounce diving or saturation diving, with access to the water through a hatch at the bottom. The hatch is sealed before ascent to retain internal pressure. At the surface, this type of bell can lock on to a hyperbaric chamber where the divers live under saturation or are decompressed. The bell is mated with the chamber system via the bottom hatchway or a side hatchway, and the trunking in between is pressurized to enable the divers to transfer through to the chamber under pressure. In saturation diving the bell is merely the ride to and from the job, and the chamber system is the living quarters. If the dive is relatively short (a bounce dive), decompression can be done in the bell in exactly the same way it would be done in the chamber.

A third type is the rescue bell, used for the rescue of personnel from sunk submarines which have maintained structural integrity. These bells may operate at atmospheric internal pressure and must withstand the ambient water pressure.

==History==

The diving bell is one of the earliest types of equipment for underwater work and exploration. Its use was first described by Aristotle in the 4th century BC: &quot;they enable the divers to respire equally well by letting down a cauldron, for this does not fill with water, but retains the air, for it is forced straight down into the water.&quot; Recurring legends about Alexander the Great (including some versions of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;) tell he explored the sea in some closed vessel, lowered from his ships. Their origin is hard to determine, but some of the earliest dated works are from the early Middle Ages. In 1535, Guglielmo de Lorena created and tested his own diving bell to explore a sunken vessel in a lake near Rome. De Lorena&#x27;s diving bell only had space for enough oxygen for a few minutes however, the air in his diving bell was reported to last for one to two hours with the limiting factor being a diver&#x27;s ability to withstand cold and fatigue, not lack of oxygen. The mechanism he used needed to keep the pressure inside the bell continuous, supply fresh air, and remove air exhaled by the diver. To accomplish this, it is believed that de Lorena used a method similar to what would later be Edmond Halley&#x27;s 1691 design.

In 1616, Franz Kessler designed an improved diving bell, making the bell reach the diver&#x27;s ankles, and adding windows and a ballast to the bottom. This design no longer needed to be tethered to the surface, but it is unclear whether or not it was actually built.

In 1642, John Winthrop reported one Edward Bendall building two large wooden barrels, weighted with lead and open at their bottoms, to salvage a ship &quot;Mary Rose&quot; which had exploded and sunk, blocking the harbor of Charlestown, Boston. Bendall undertook the work on condition that he be awarded all the value of the salvage should he succeed in unblocking the harbor, or half the value he could salvage if he could not.

In 1658, Albrecht von Treileben was permitted to salvage the warship &quot;Vasa&quot;, which sank in Stockholm harbor on its maiden voyage in 1628. Between 1663 and 1665 von Treileben&#x27;s divers were successful in raising most of the cannon, working from a diving bell.

A diving bell is mentioned in the 1663 (stanza 16):
In late 1686, Sir William Phipps convinced investors to fund an expedition to what is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic to find sunken treasure, despite the location of the shipwreck being based entirely on rumor and speculation. In January 1687, Phipps found the wreck of the Spanish galleon &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Concepción&quot; off the coast of Santo Domingo. Some sources say they used an inverted container for the salvage operation while others say the crew was assisted by Indian divers in the shallow waters. The operation lasted from February to April 1687 during which time they salvaged jewels, some gold and 30 tons of silver which, at the time, was worth over £200,000.

In 1689, Denis Papin suggested that the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell could be maintained by a force pump or bellows. Engineer John Smeaton utilized this concept in 1789.

In 1691, Dr. Edmond Halley completed plans for a diving bell capable of remaining submerged for extended periods of time, and fitted with a window for the purpose of undersea exploration. In Halley&#x27;s design, atmosphere is replenished by sending weighted barrels of air down from the surface.
In 1775, Charles Spalding, an Edinburgh confectioner, improved on Halley&#x27;s design by adding a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along with a series of ropes for signaling the surface crew. Spalding and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson, later suffocated off the coast of Dublin in 1783 doing salvage work in a diving bell of Spalding&#x27;s design.

==Mechanics==

The bell is lowered into the water by cables from a crane, gantry or A-frame attached to a floating platform or shore structure. The bell is ballasted so as to remain upright in the water and to be negatively buoyant, so that it will sink even when full of air.

Hoses, supplied by gas compressors or banks of high pressure storage cylinders at the surface, provide breathing gas to the bell, serving two functions:
* Fresh gas is available for breathing by the occupants.
* Volume reduction of the air in an open bell due to increasing hydrostatic pressure as the bell is lowered is compensated. Adding pressurized gas ensures that the gas space within the bell remains at constant volume as the bell descends in the water. Otherwise the bell would partially fill with water as the gas was compressed.

The physics of the diving bell applies also to an underwater habitat equipped with a moon pool, which is like a diving bell enlarged to the size of a room or two, and with the water–air interface at the bottom confined to a section rather than forming the entire bottom of the structure.

===Wet bell===

A wet bell, or open bell, is a platform for lowering and lifting divers to and from the underwater workplace, which has an air filled space, open at the bottom, where the divers can stand or sit with their heads out of the water. The air space is at ambient pressure at all times, so there are no great pressure differences, and the greatest structural loads are usually self weight and the buoyancy of the air space. A fairly heavy ballast is often required to counteract the buoyancy of the airspace, and this is usually set low at the bottom of the bell, which helps with stability. The base of the bell is usually a grating or deck which the divers can stand on, and folding seats may be fitted for the divers&#x27; comfort during ascent, as in-water decompression may be long. Other equipment that is carried on the bell includes cylinders with the emergency gas supply, and racks or boxes for tools and equipment to be used on the job. There may be a tackle for hoisting and supporting a disabled diver so that their head projects into the air space.

====Type 1 wet bell====
The type 1 wet bell does not have an umbilical supplying the bell, because diver&#x27;s umbilicals supply the divers directly from the surface, similar to a diving stage. Divers deploying from a type 1 bell will exit on the opposite side to where the umbilicals enter the bell so that the umbilicals pass through the bell and the divers can find their way back to the bell at all times by following the umbilical. Bailout from a type 1 bell is done by exiting the bell on the side that the umbilicals enter the bell so they no longer pass through the bell, leaving the divers free to surface.

====Type 2 wet bell====
A gas panel inside the bell is supplied by the bell umbilical and the emergency gas cylinders, and supplies the divers&#x27; umbilicals and sometimes BIBS sets. There will be racks to hang the divers&#x27; excursion umbilicals, which for this application must not be buoyant. Abandonment of a type 2 wet bell requires the divers to manage their own umbilicals as they ascend along a remaining connection to the surface.

====Operation of a wet bell====

The bell with divers on board is deployed from the working platform (usually a vessel) by a crane, davit, or other mechanism with a man-rated winch. The bell is lowered into the water and to the working depth at a rate recommended by the decompression schedule, and which allows the divers to equalize comfortably. Wet bells with an air space will have the air space topped up as the bell descends and the air is compressed by increasing hydrostatic pressure. The air will also be refreshed as required to keep the carbon dioxide level acceptable to the occupants. The oxygen content is also replenished, but this is not the limiting factor, as the oxygen partial pressure will be higher than in surface air due to the depth.

When the bell is raised, the pressure will drop and excess air due to expansion will automatically spill under the edges. If the divers are breathing from the bell airspace at the time, it may need to be vented with additional air to maintain a low carbon dioxide level. The decrease in pressure is proportional to the depth as the airspace is at ambient pressure, and the ascent must be conducted according to the planned decompression schedule appropriate to the depth and duration of the diving operation.

===Closed bell===


A closed, or dry, bell, also known as a personnel transfer capsule or submersible decompression chamber, is a pressure vessel for human occupation which is lowered into the sea to the workplace, equalised in pressure to the environment, and opened to allow the divers in and out. These functional requirements dictate the structure and arrangement. The internal pressure requires a strong structure, and a sphere or spherically ended cylinder is most efficient for this purpose. When the bell is underwater, it must be possible for the occupants to get in or out without flooding the interior. This requires a pressure hatch at the bottom. The requirement that the bell reliably retain its internal pressure when the external pressure is lowered dictates that the hatch open inward, so that internal pressure will hold it closed. The bell is lowered through the water to working depth, so must be negatively buoyant. This may require additional ballast, which may be attached by a system that can be released from inside the bell in an emergency, without losing pressure, to allow the bell to float back to the surface.

Locking onto a deck decompression chamber or saturation system at the surface is possible either from the bottom or the side. Using the bell bottom hatch for this purpose has the advantage of only needing one hatch, and the disadvantage of having to lift the bell up and place it over a vertical entry to the chamber. A bell used in this way may be called a personnel transfer capsule. If decompression is done inside the bell, it may be referred to as a submersible decompression chamber.

The bell bottom hatch must be wide enough for a large diver fully kitted with appropriate bailout cylinders, to get in and out without undue difficulty, and it can not be closed while the diver is outside as the umbilical is tended through the hatch by the bellman. It must also be possible for the bellman to lift the working diver in through the hatch if he is unconscious, and close the hatch after him, so that the bell can be sealed and pressurised for the ascent. A lifting tackle is usually fitted inside the bell for this purpose, and the bell may be partially flooded to assist the procedure.

The internal space must be large enough for a fully kitted diver and bellman (the stand-by diver responsible for manning the bell while the working diver is locked out) to sit, and for their umbilicals to be stowed neatly on racks, and the hatch to be opened inwards while they are inside. Anything bigger will make the bell heavier than it really needs to be, so all equipment that does not need to be inside is mounted outside. This includes a framework to support the ancillary equipment and protect the bell from impact and snagging on obstacles, and the emergency gas and power supplies, which are usually racked around the framework. The emergency gas supply (EGS) is connected via manifolds to the internal gas panel. The part of the framework that keeps the lower hatch off the bottom is called the bell stage. It may be removable, which can facilitate connection to a vertical access chamber lock. The bell umbilical is connected to the bell via through hull fittings (hull penetrations), which must withstand all operating pressures without leaking. The internal gas panel connects to the hull penetrations and the diver&#x27;s umbilicals. The umbilicals will carry main breathing gas supply, a communications cable, a pneumofathometer hose, hot water supply for suit heating, power for helmet mounted lights, and possibly gas reclaim hose and video cable. The bell umbilical will usually also carry a power cable for internal and external bell lighting. Hydraulic power lines for tools do not have to pass into the interior of the bell as they will never be used there, and tools can also be stored outside. There may be an emergency through-water communications system with a battery power supply, and a location transponder working on the international standard 37.5 kHz. The bell may also have viewports and a medical lock.

A closed bell may be fitted with an umbilical cutter, a mechanism which allows the occupants to sever the bell umbilical from inside the sealed and pressurised bell in the event of an umbilical snag that prevents bell recovery. The device is typically hydraulically operated using a hand pump inside the bell, and can shear the umbilical at or just above the point where it is fastened to the top of the bell. Once cut, the bell can be raised and if the umbilical can then be recovered, it can be reconnected with only a short length lost. An external connection known as a hot stab unit which allows an emergency umbilical to be connected to maintain life support in the bell during a rescue operation may be fitted.

The divers in the bell may also be monitored from the diving control point by closed circuit video, and the bell atmosphere can be monitored for volatile hydrocarbon contamination by a hyperbaric hydrocarbon analyser which can be linked to a topside repeater and set to give an alarm if the hydrocarbon levels exceed 10% of the anaesthetic level.

The bell may be fitted with an external emergency battery power pack, carbon dioxide scrubber for the internal atmosphere, and air conditioner for temperature control. Power supply is typically 12 or 24V DC.

A bell will be provided with equipment to rescue and treat an injured diver. This will normally include a small tackle to lift the disabled diver into the bell through the bottom hatch and secure them in an upright position if needed. A bell flooding valve, also known as a flood-up valve may be available to partially flood the interior to aid in lifting a disabled diver into the bell. Once inside and secure, the bell is cleared of water using the blow-down valve to fill the interior with breathing gas at ambient pressure and displace the water out through the hatch. A first aid kit will be carried.

====British mini-bell system====
A variant of this system used in the North Sea oilfields between early 1986 and the early 90s was the Oceantech Minibell system, which was used for bell-bounce dives, and was operated as an open bell for the descent, and as a closed bell for the ascent. The divers would climb into the bell after stowing their umbilicals on outside racks, remove their helmets for outside storage, seal the bell, and return to the surface, venting to the depth of the first decompression stop. The bell would then be locked onto a deck decompression chamber, the divers transferred under pressure to complete decompression in the chamber, and the bell would be available for use for another dive.

===Breathing gas distribution===
Breathing gas supplies for the bell comprise a primary gas supply, a reserve gas supply and an emergency gas supply carried on the bell. The divers will also carry bailout gas in scuba cylinders, or as a semi-closed circuit rebreather, sufficient to get them back to the bellin the event of an umbilical supply failure.

Primary gas, or main gas supply may be compressed air, which is usually supplied by a low pressure breathing air compressor, or mixed gas, which is usually provided in manifolded clusters of high-pressure storage cylinders, commonly referred to as &quot;quads&quot;. Primary gas is connected to the main gas panel throughout the diving operation except when it fails or a problem is being corrected, during which time the divers are switched over to reserve gas.

Reserve gas, or secondary gas, which is connected to the main gas panel and available for immediate use by opening the supply valve, may also be supplied by low pressure compressor, or from high pressure storage. It has the same composition as the main gas supply.

Decompression gas, when used, is also supplied via the main gas panel. It may be the same gas as the primary gas, or an oxygen enriched mixture, or pure oxygen. Gas switching for in-water decompression in a wet bell is not the preferred procedure for commercial diving, as the entire breathing gas delivery system must be oxygen clean, and as a decompression chamber is required on site when a specified limit of obligatory decompression is planned, it is more convenient to do surface decompression on oxygen (SurDO2)in the chamber. The relative safety of surface decompression and in-water decompression is uncertain. Both procedures are accepted by health and safety regulatory bodies.

Emergency gas is carried on the bell, usually in a small number of 50 litre high-pressure cylinders connected to the bell gas panel. This should be the same gas as the primary gas. On closed bells there is an additional supply of pure oxygen if the bell has a carbon dioxide scrubber for the bell atmosphere. On a type 2 wet bell or a closed bell this emergency gas can be distributed to the divers from the bell gas panel operated by the bellman, through the excursion umbilicals, .

Each diver carries an emergency gas supply (bailout gas) sufficient to get back to the bell under any reasonably foreseeable circumstances of umbilical supply failure of primary, reserve, and bell emergency gas supplies.

The main gas distribution panel is located at the control point for the diving operation, and operated by the gas man, who may also be a diver, or if the gas is air, it may be directly operated by the diving supervisor.

====Bell gas panel====
The bell gas panel is a manifold of valves, pipes, hoses and gauges mounted inside a closed bell, and under the canopy of a type 2 wet bell, and is operated by the bellman. When a helium reclaim system is in use, the return hose for the reclaimed gas passes through the bell gas panel and a back-pressure regulator on its way to the surface. The bell gas panel is supplied with primary and secondary gas supplies from the main gas panel through the bell umbilical, and with on-board emergency gas from the cylinders carried on the bell.

===Deployment of a modern diving bell===

Diving bells are deployed over the side of the vessel or platform, or through a moonpool, using a gantry or A-frame from which the clump weight and the bell are suspended. On dive support vessels with in-built saturation systems the bell may be deployed through a moon pool. The bell handling system is also known as the launch and recovery system (LARS).

The bell umbilical supplies gas to the bell gas panel, and is separate from the divers&#x27; excursion umbilicals, which are connected to the gas panel on the inside of the bell. The bell umbilical is deployed from a large drum or umbilical basket and care is taken to keep the tension in the umbilical low but sufficient to remain near vertical in use and to roll up neatly during recovery, as this reduces the risk of the umbilical snagging on underwater obstructions.

Wet bell handling differs from closed bell handling in that there is no requirement to transfer the bell to and from the chamber system to make a pressure-tight connection, and that a wet bell will be required to maintain a finely controlled speed of descent and ascent and remain at a fixed depth within fairly close tolerances for the occupants to decompress at a specific ambient pressure, whereas a closed bell can be removed from the water without delay and the speed of ascent and descent is not critical.

A bell diving team will usually include two divers in the bell, designated as the working diver and bellman, though they may alternate these roles during the dive. The bellman is a stand-by diver and umbilical tender from the bell to the working diver, the operator of the on-board gas distribution panel, and has an umbilical about 2 m longer than the working diver to ensure that the working diver can be reached in an emergency. This can be adjusted by tying off the umbilicals inside the bell to limit deployment length, which must often be done in any case, to prevent the divers from approaching known hazards in the water. Depending on circumstances, there may also be a surface stand-by diver, with attendant, in case there is an emergency where a surface oriented diver could assist. The team will be under the direct control of the diving supervisor, will include a winch operator, and may include a dedicated surface gas panel operator.

====Clump weight====

Deployment of a diving bell usually starts by lowering the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended in the bight of a cable which runs from a winch, over a sheave on one side of the gantry, down to the weight, round a pair of sheaves on the sides of the weight, and back up to the other side of the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the clump weight cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. Deployment of the bell is by a separate cable attached to the top, which runs over a sheave in the middle of the gantry. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads prevent it from rotating on the deployment cable, which would put twist into the umbilical and risk loops or snagging. The clump weight cables therefore act as guidelines or rails along which the bell is lowered to the workplace, and raised back to the platform. If the lifting winch or cable fails, and the bell ballast is released, a positively buoyant bell can float up and the cables will guide it to the surface to a position where it can be recovered relatively easily. The clump weight cable can also be used as an emergency recovery system, in which case both bell and weight are lifted together. An alternative system for preventing rotation on the lifting cable is the use of a cross-haul system, which may also be used as a means of adjusting the lateral position of the bell at working depth, and as an emergency recovery system.

====Bell stage====

A bell stage is an open framework below the bell which prevents the bell lower lock from getting too close to the clump weight or seabed, ensuring that there is space for the divers to safely exit and enter the bell. This can be deployed either as part of the bell, or as part of the clump weight. The bell stage may be fitted with baskets for carrying tools and equipment.

====Bell handling system====

A closed bell handling system is used to move the bell from the position where it is locked on to the chamber system into the water, lower it to the working depth and hold it in position without excessive movement, and recover it to the chamber system. The system used to transfer the bell on deck may be a deck trolley system, an overhead gantry or a swinging A-frame. The system must constrain movement of the supported bell sufficiently to allow accurate location on the chamber trunking even in bad weather. A bell cursor may be used to control movement through and above the splash zone, and heave compensation gear may be used to limit vertical movement when in the water and clear of the cursor, particularly at working depth when the diver may be locked out and the bell is open to ambient pressure.

====Bell cursor====

A bell cursor is a device used to guide and control the motion of the bell through the air and the splash zone near the surface, where waves can move the bell significantly. It can either be a passive system which relies on additional ballast weight or an active system which uses a controlled drive system to provide vertical motion. The cursor has a cradle which locks onto the bell and which moves vertically on rails to constrain lateral movement. The bell is released and locked onto the cursor in the relatively still water below the splash zone.

====Heave compensation====

Heave compensation equipment is used to stabilise the depth of the bell by counteracting vertical movement of the handling system caused by movements of the platform, and usually also maintains correct tension on the guide wires. It is not usually essential, depending on the stability of the platform.

====Cross-hauling====
Cross-hauling is the use of a cable connected to the bell to move the bell laterally when this is useful, such as when the workplace is not close to directly below the LARS. Cross-hauling systems are cables from an independent lifting device, and may also be used to limit rotation and as an emergency bell recovery system.

==Use with hyperbaric chambers==
Commercial diving contractors generally use a closed bell in conjunction with a surface hyperbaric chamber, These have safety and ergonomic advantages and allow decompression to be carried out after the bell has been raised to the surface and back on board the diving support vessel. Closed bells are often used in saturation diving and undersea rescue operations. The diving bell would be connected via the mating flange of an airlock to the deck decompression chamber or saturation system for transfer under pressure of the occupants.

== Air-lock diving bells ==
The air lock diving-bell plant was a purpose-built barge for the laying, examination and repair of moorings for battleships at Gibraltar harbour. It was designed by Siebe Gorman of Lambeth and Forrestt &amp; Co. Ltd of Wivenhoe in Essex, who built and supplied it in 1902 to the British Admiralty.

The vessel came about from the specific conditions at Gibraltar. The heavy harbour moorings have three chains extending out radially along the seabed from a central ring, each terminating in a large anchor. Most harbours have a soft seabed, and it is usual to lay down moorings by settling anchors in the mud, clay or sand but this could not be done in Gibraltar harbour, where the seabed is hard rock.

In operation the barge would be towed over the work site, moored in place with anchors, and the bell would be lowered vertically to the bottom. and the water displaced by pumping. The work teams entered the bell through an airlock in the central access shaft. Working in ordinary clothes they could dig out anchorings for the moorings.

The German service barge &quot;Carl Straat&quot; is similar in concept, but the bell is lowered by swinging the access tube. &quot;Carl Straat&quot; was built in 1963 for the Waterways and Shipping Directorate West in Münster. The 6 m × 4 m × 2.5 m bell is accessible through a 2 m diameter tube and an airlock. A pantograph system keeps the bell and internal stairs level at all depths. Maximum working depth is 10 m. The vessel is used on those inland waterways which have locks large enough to accommodate its 52 m length overall, 11.8 m beam and 1.6 m draft.

==Rescue bell==
Diving bells have been used for submarine rescue. The closed, dry bell is designed to seal against the deck of the submarine above an escape hatch. Water in the space between the bell and the submarine is pumped out, and the pressure difference holds the bell against the submarine, so the hatches can be opened to allow occupants to leave the submarine and enter the bell. The hatches are then closed, the bell skirt flooded to release it from the submarine, and the bell with its load of survivors is hoisted back to the surface, where the survivors exit and the bell may return for the next group. The internal pressure in the bell is usually kept at atmospheric pressure to minimise run time by eliminating the need for decompression, so the seal between the bell skirt and the submarine deck is critical to the safety of the operation. This seal is provided by using a flexible sealing material, usually a type of rubber, which is pressed firmly against the smooth hatch surround by the pressure differential when the skirt is pumped out.

==Observation bell==
An observation bell is a closed bell, generally operated with internal pressure at atmospheric pressure, which provides an observation platform that can be lowered to depth with one or more occupants who can observe the environment through viewports, but are generally not provided with a means of interacting physically with the outside environment. The first observation bell was one of the first modern bells constructed in the late 19th century.

The bathysphere and observation bell are similar structures. A steel bathysphere created in 1930 by William Beebe and Otis Barton had three crystal glass windows made for observation. Observation bells for shallower depths generally use different designs to bathyspheres.
==Bell diving skills and procedures==
Routine procedures for bell diving include preparation of the bell for the dive, descent and ascent, and monitoring of the working diver by the bellman. The bellman is responsible for ensuring that the bell and its occupants are ready for descent or ascent, and for communications with the surface for tenting the working diver&#x27;s umbilical and for operation of the bell gas panel.

A wet bell ascent usually includes decompression stops in the water, and sometimes surface decompression.

Closed bell procedures also include locking in and locking out at depth, and transfer under pressure between bell and the saturation system or a deck decompression chamber.

Emergency bell procedures include dynamic positioning alarm and runout response, emergency bell gas panel operations, such as surface gas supply failure or contaminated surface gas supply, both of which require bailout to onboard gas, hot water supply failure, and rescue of the working diver by the bellman. Voice communications failure requires appropriate use of emergency light and gas signals. Bell abandonment may be necessary if a wet bell cannot be raised, but saturation divers in a closed bell must be rescued in the bell or to another bell as they cannot be surfaced in-water.

==Hazards==
A closed bell that has been depressurised for maintenance access will probably retain residual diving breathing gas mixture, which will usually be hypoxic at normal atmospheric pressure, and could cause anyone who enters to lose consciousness quite rapidly. Helium based mixtures are buoyant and require active flushing with a strong flow of air, followed by testing for oxygen partial pressure before entry.

The bell atmosphere can be contaminated by materials brought in by a diver who was exposed to the contaminants during the lock-out. These will depend on the working environment, and may include petrochemicals. This is a greater problem with closed bells.

Like other pressure vessels for human occupancy, a fire inside a diving bell can be extremely dangerous to occupants. This is primarily a problem in closed bells, as occupants of open bells can generally immerse themselves in water and flood the bell to quickly extinguish a fire, and the interior is generally wet and not easy to ignite. Partial pressure of oxygen in the bell is generally limited to prevent oxygen toxicity and this is also a defence against ignition. In saturation diving the bell atmosphere and breathing gas supply is generally the same as the accommodations atmosphere, which is carefully monitored and kept at a safe oxygen partial pressure for oxygen toxicity, which has an inherently low fire risk.

==Diver training==
Divers qualified to work from bells are trained in the skills and procedures relevant to the type of bell they will be expected to work from. Open bells are generally used for surface oriented surface-supplied deep air diving, and closed bells are used for saturation diving and surface oriented mixed gas diving. These skills include the standard procedures for the deployment of the working diver from the bell, the tending of the working diver from the bell by the bellman, and the emergency and rescue procedures for both working diver and bellman. There is considerable similarity and significant differences in these procedures between open and closed bell diving.

==Underwater habitats==

As noted above, further extension of the wet bell concept is the moon-pool-equipped underwater habitat, where divers may spend long periods in dry comfort while acclimated to the increased pressure experienced underwater. By not needing to return to the surface between excursions into the water, they can reduce the necessity for decompression (gradual reduction of pressure), after each excursion, required to avoid problems with nitrogen bubbles releasing from the bloodstream (the bends, also known as caisson disease). Such problems can occur at pressures greater than , corresponding to a depth of of water. Divers in an ambient pressure habitat will require decompression when they return to the surface. This is a form of saturation diving.

==In nature==
The diving bell spider, &quot;Argyroneta aquatica&quot;, is a spider which lives entirely under water, even though it could survive on land.

Since the spider must breathe air, it constructs from silk a habitat like an open diving bell which it attaches to an underwater plant. The spider collects air in a thin layer around its body, trapped by dense hairs on its abdomen and legs. It transports this air to its diving bell to replenish the air supply in the bell. This allows the spider to remain in the bell for long periods, where it waits for its prey.

<doc id="654098" wikidata="Q1052674" url="?curid=654098" title="Symmetric algebra">
<text>In mathematics, the symmetric algebra (also denoted on a vector space over a field is a commutative algebra over that contains , and is, in some sense, minimal for this property. Here, &quot;minimal&quot; means that satisfies the following universal property: for every linear map from to a commutative algebra , there is a unique algebra homomorphism such that , where is the inclusion map of in .

If is a basis of , the symmetric algebra can be identified, through a canonical isomorphism, to the polynomial ring , where the elements of are considered as indeterminates. Therefore, the symmetric algebra over can be viewed as a &quot;coordinate free&quot; polynomial ring over .

The symmetric algebra can be built as the quotient of the tensor algebra by the two-sided ideal generated by the elements of the form .

All these definitions and properties extend naturally to the case where is a module (not necessarily a free one) over a commutative ring.

==Construction==
===From tensor algebra===
It is possible to use the tensor algebra to describe the symmetric algebra . In fact, can be defined as the quotient algebra of by the two-sided ideal generated by the commutators formula_1

It is straightforward to verify that the resulting algebra satisfies the universal property stated in the introduction. Because of the universal property of the tensor algebra, a linear map from to a commutative algebra extends to an algebra homomorphism formula_2, which factors through because is commutative. The extension of 
to an algebra homomorphism formula_3 is unique because generates as a -algebra.

This results also directly from a general result of category theory, which asserts that the composition of two left adjoint functors is also a left adjoint functor. Here, the forgetful functor from commutative algebras to vector spaces or modules (forgetting the multiplication) is the composition of the forgetful functors from commutative algebras to associative algebras (forgetting commutativity), and from associative algebras to vectors or modules (forgetting the multiplication). As the tensor algebra and the quotient by commutators are left adjoint to these forgetful functors, their composition is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from commutative algebra to vectors or modules, and this proves the desired universal property.

===From polynomial ring===
The symmetric algebra can also be built from polynomial rings. 

If is a -vector space or a free -module, with a basis , let be the polynomial ring that has the elements of as indeterminates. The homogeneous polynomials of degree one form a vector space or a free module that can be identified with . It is straightforward to verify that this makes a solution to the universal problem stated in the introduction. This implies that and are canonically isomorphic, and can therefore be identified. This results also immediately from general considerations of category theory, since free modules and polynomial rings are free objects of their respective categories.

If is a module that is not free, it can be written formula_4 where is a free module, and is a submodule of . In this case, one has 
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the ideal generated by . (Here, equals signs mean equality up to a canonical isomorphism.) Again this can be proved by showing that one has a solution of the universal property, and this can be done either by a straightforward but boring computation, or by using category theory, and more specifically, the fact that a quotient is the solution of the universal problem for morphisms that map to zero a given subset. (Depending on the case, the kernel is a normal subgroup, a submodule or an ideal, and the usual definition of quotients can be viewed as a proof of the existence of a solution of the universal problem.)

==Grading==
The symmetric algebra is a graded algebra. That is, it is a direct sum
:formula_7
where formula_8 called the th symmetric power of , is the vector subspace or submodule generated by the products of elements of . (The second symmetric power formula_9 is sometimes called the symmetric square of ).

This can be proved by various means. One follows from the tensor-algebra construction: since the tensor algebra is graded, and the symmetric algebra is its quotient by a homogeneous ideal: the ideal generated by all formula_10 where and are in , that is, homogeneous of degree one.

In the case of a vector space or a free module, the gradation is the gradation of the polynomials by the total degree. A non-free module can be written as , where is a free module of base ; its symmetric algebra is the quotient of the (graded) symmetric algebra of (a polynomial ring) by the homogeneous ideal generated by the elements of , which are homogeneous of degree one.

One can also define formula_11 as the solution of the universal problem for -linear symmetric functions from into a vector space or a module, and then verify that the direct sum of all formula_11 satisfies the universal problem for the symmetric algebra.

==Relationship with symmetric tensors==
As the symmetric algebra of a vector space is a quotient of the tensor algebra, an element of the symmetric algebra is not a tensor, and, in particular, is not a symmetric tensor. However, symmetric tensors are strongly related to the symmetric algebra.

A &quot;symmetric tensor&quot; of degree is an element of that is invariant under the action of the symmetric group formula_13 More precisely, given formula_14 the transformation formula_15 defines a linear endomorphism of . A symmetric tensor is a tensor that is invariant under all these endomorphisms. The symmetric tensors of degree form a vector subspace (or module) . The &quot;symmetric tensors&quot; are the elements of the direct sum formula_16 which is a graded vector space (or a graded module). It is not an algebra, as the tensor product of two symmetric tensors is not symmetric in general.

Let formula_17 be the restriction to of the canonical surjection formula_18 If is invertible in the ground field (or ring), then formula_17 is an isomorphism. This is always the case with a ground field of characteristic zero. The inverse isomorphism is the linear map defined (on products of vectors) by the symmetrization
:formula_20

The map formula_17 is not injective if the characteristic is less than +1; for example formula_22 is zero in characteristic two. Over a ring of characteristic zero, formula_17 can be non surjective; for example, over the integers, if and are two linearly independent elements of that are not in , then formula_24 since formula_25

In summary, over a field of characteristic zero, the symmetric tensors and the symmetric algebra form two isomorphic graded vector spaces. They can thus be identified as far as only the vector space structure is concerned, but they cannot be identified as soon as products are involved. Moreover, this isomorphism does not extend to the cases of fields of positive characteristic and rings that do not contain the rational numbers.

==Categorical properties==
Given a module over a commutative ring , the symmetric algebra can be defined by the following universal property:

::For every -linear map from to a commutative -algebra , there is a unique -algebra homomorphism formula_26 such that formula_27 where is the inclusion of in .

As for every universal property, as soon as a solution exists, this defines uniquely the symmetric algebra, up to a canonical isomorphism. It follows that all properties of the symmetric algebra can be deduced from the universal property. This section is devoted to the main properties that belong to category theory.

The symmetric algebra is a functor from the category of -modules to the category of -commutative algebra, since the universal property implies that every module homomorphism formula_28 can be uniquely extended to an algebra homomorphism formula_29

The universal property can be reformulated by saying that the symmetric algebra is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that sends a commutative algebra to its underlying module.

==Symmetric algebra of an affine space==
One can analogously construct the symmetric algebra on an affine space. The key difference is that the symmetric algebra of an affine space is not a graded algebra, but a filtered algebra: one can determine the degree of a polynomial on an affine space, but not its homogeneous parts.

For instance, given a linear polynomial on a vector space, one can determine its constant part by evaluating at 0. On an affine space, there is no distinguished point, so one cannot do this (choosing a point turns an affine space into a vector space).

==Analogy with exterior algebra==
The &quot;S&quot;&quot;k&quot; are functors comparable to the exterior powers; here, though, the dimension grows with &quot;k&quot;; it is given by
:formula_30
where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;V&quot;. This binomial coefficient is the number of &quot;n&quot;-variable monomials of degree &quot;k&quot;.
In fact, the symmetric algebra and the exterior algebra appear as the isotypical components of the trivial and sign representation of the action of formula_31 acting on the tensor product formula_32 (for example over the complex field) 

==As a Hopf algebra==
The symmetric algebra can be given the structure of a Hopf algebra. See Tensor algebra for details.

==As a universal enveloping algebra==
The symmetric algebra &quot;S&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is the universal enveloping algebra of an abelian Lie algebra, i.e. one in which the Lie bracket is identically 0.

<doc id="654099" wikidata="Q7096964" url="?curid=654099" title="Operation Deckhouse Five">
<text>Operation Deckhouse Five was a United States Marine Corps (USMC) and Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps operation that took place from 6–15 January 1967 in the Mekong Delta, during the Vietnam War. &quot;The ten-day sweep,&quot; reported the AP from its daily military roundup from Saigon, &quot;proved unproductive.&quot;

==Background==
For the USMC, the operation was notable for the following reasons: it was a sizable, combined USMC and Vietnamese Marine amphibious operation and it was the last Special Landing Force (SLF) amphibious landing to take place beyond the boundaries of I Corps. An SLF was the designation of the Marine battalion (1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment reinforced) and the medium helicopter squadron (HMM) assigned to the Seventh Fleet Amphibious Ready Group. The SLF regularly conducted amphibious operations across Vietnamese beaches into areas of suspected Viet Cong and People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) activity. The intent of the operation was to secure ammunition dumps, ordnance and engineering workshops, hospitals, and indoctrination centers.

==Operation==
After 2 days of postponement due to bad weather, the operation began on 6 January with a sea and heliborne assault onto the beaches between the Co Chien and Ham Luong branches of the Mekong Delta which was suspected of being a Viet Cong stronghold.

===Supporting units===
* HMM-362
* VMO-3
* USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)
* USS Canberra (CA-70)

==Aftermath==
The operation was a ‘disappointment’ resulting in ‘only’ 21 Vietcong killed, 2 small arms workshops destroyed and 44 weapons captured for the loss of 7 US and 1 Vietnamese Marines. It was believed that the Vietcong had been forewarned of the attack because intelligence learned that larger Vietcong units had recently left the area.

<text>Jason Thorpe Robinson (born 30 July 1974) is an English former dual-code international rugby league and rugby union footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. Playing as a wing or fullback, he won 51 rugby union international caps for England and is the first black man to captain the England team. He was part of the 2003 World Cup winning rugby union England team.

In rugby league he won 12 caps for Great Britain and seven for England. Throughout his career Robinson was noted for his speed and acceleration, side-step and ability to beat defenders.

==Rugby league==
Born 30 July 1974 in Leeds, West Yorkshire, Robinson began playing rugby as a child at Hunslet Boys Club and then Hunslet Parkside before starting his rugby league career in 1991 at semi-professional side Hunslet. Despite being offered a contract by Leeds, he stuck by his club as it would have meant leaving at an inconvenient time. He was later rewarded by a contract with Wigan Warriors who went on to dominate British rugby league. His form quickly establishing him in Wigan&#x27;s first team, as a teenager he was touted as a future halfback or loose forward. He was selected to play on the wing for Wigan against the visiting Brisbane Broncos in the 1992 World Club Challenge.

Robinson played in Wigan&#x27;s 5–4 victory over St. Helens in the 1992 Lancashire Cup Final at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Sunday 18 October 1992.

He played and scored a try in Wigan&#x27;s 15–8 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1992–93 Regal Trophy Final during the 1992–93 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 23 January 1993, played in the 2–33 defeat by Castleford in the 1993–94 Regal Trophy Final during the 1993–94 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 22 January 1994, played in the 40–10 victory over Warrington in the 1994–95 Regal Trophy Final during the 1994–95 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday28 January 1995, and played in the 25–16 victory over St. Helens in the 1995–96 Regal Trophy Final during the 1995–96 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday 13 January 1996.

In 1993, Robinson played in his first Challenge Cup Final, with Wigan defeating Widnes. Later that year at age 19 Robinson was first selected to represent Great Britain on the wing against New Zealand.

After the 1993–94 Rugby Football League season, Robinson travelled with defending champions Wigan to Brisbane, playing on the wing in their 1994 World Club Challenge victory over Australian premiers, the Brisbane Broncos.

In 1995, Robinson was offered a 4-year deal worth a record £1.25 million by the Australian Rugby League to play for the South Sydney Rabbitohs at the end of 1997&#x27;s Super League II. He recovered from a foot injury to play in Wigan&#x27;s 30–10 Challenge Cup Final victory over Leeds, scoring two tries and earning himself the Lance Todd Trophy as man-of-the-match.

Robinson played for England in the 1995 World Cup Final on the wing but Australia won the match and retained the Cup.

In May 1996, Robinson played for Wigan in a special two-game, cross code challenge series against Bath, then the leading club side in English rugby union. Robinson scored twice in the first game, an 82–6 victory for Wigan under league rules, as well as playing in the union game, which ended 44–19 to Bath. Following the cross-code challenge series, a number of Wigan&#x27;s players, including Robinson, elected to take advantage of the fact that rugby union had turned professional, and ended its ban on players that had played rugby league, by signing short-term contracts to play union during the Super League off-season. Robinson joined Bath and played 14 games for the side between September 1996 and January 1997. At the end of the first Super League season, Robinson was named on the wing in the 1996 Super League Dream Team.

In the midst of the Super League war, Robinson played a one-off international for a &#x27;Rest of the World&#x27; team in their 28–8 loss against the Australian Rugby League&#x27;s Kangaroos in mid-1997. With his contracted move to Sydney set to take place at the conclusion of the 1997&#x27;s Super League II, Robinson had had a change of heart and Wigan were able to negotiate his release from the ARL&#x27;s contract so he could continue playing for his club. He then scored a try for Great Britain in each of the three matches against Australia in the post-season Super League Test series.

In 1998, Robinson scored Wigan&#x27;s only try in Super League&#x27;s first ever Grand Final, which the Cherry &amp; Whites won. As a result, he was awarded the Harry Sunderland Trophy as man-of-the-match. He was also named on the wing in the 1998 season&#x27;s Super League Dream Team, and again in 1999 and 2000.

Robinson played at fullback in the Wigan Warriors&#x27; defeat by St. Helens in the 2000 Super League Grand Final. Days after the match, it was announced that he had signed for the Zurich Premiership&#x27;s Sale Sharks rugby union side, with Robinson citing the lack of anything left to prove in rugby league and the desire to represent England and the British Lions in the 15-man code.

==Rugby union==
He made his debut for Sale Sharks against Coventry in November 2000. In the 2005/6 season he became the first person to have won both the Guinness Premiership, and the Super League trophies.

===England===
Robinson made his England début as a substitute against Italy in February 2001, having played in the A match against Wales at Wrexham a fortnight earlier. In doing so he was only the second man ever to play rugby union for England after having first played Rugby League for Great Britain (the first having been Barrie-Jon Mather in 1999).

He scored 30 tries in 56 international matches, including a try in the 2003 World Cup Final against Australia. He played in all seven of England&#x27;s World Cup games in 2003.

In the 2004 Six Nations, he scored three tries playing as a centre in the opening match against Italy and was named Man of the Match. Robinson chose to opt out of the 2004 summer tour to recover.

After Lawrence Dallaglio&#x27;s international retirement in 2005, Jonny Wilkinson was initially appointed captain. However, Wilkinson was injured for the 2005 autumn internationals and Robinson was appointed captain. He was the 118th captain of England, the first mixed-race player and the first former professional rugby league footballer to captain England. In his first appearance as captain, he scored a hat-trick of tries in a 70–0 rout of Canada.

===British &amp; Irish Lions===
Robinson was selected by the British &amp; Irish Lions for their 2001 tour of Australia, and was one of the outstanding players in the side that won the first Test in Brisbane 29–13. In that game he sidestepped past Australian fullback Chris Latham. He went on to score another try in the last Test.

Robinson was again called up to the Lions&#x27; 2005 tour of New Zealand. He was excused from travelling with the bulk of the touring party to spend time with his wife, who was expecting the couple&#x27;s fourth child in August. Throughout his career, he normally brought his wife and children along when he went on a tour, but her pregnancy made this impossible for the 2005 tour. He joined the team on 7 June, well in advance of the first New Zealand test on 25 June.

===International retirement===

On 24 September 2005, Robinson announced his retirement from international rugby union, stating that he wished to spend more time with his family. In the 2005–2006 season, Robinson led his club Sale Sharks to their first ever Premiership title.

===Return===
Robinson returned to the England set-up for the 2007 Six Nations tournament, following the decision of new head coach Brian Ashton to recall him to provide the leadership and winning quality the team had lacked in the past year, ending a 15-month absence from the international scene. He scored two tries on his return in England&#x27;s opening victory over Scotland. He also scored another try against the Italians the following week.

On 2 April 2007, Robinson announced he would retire from playing club rugby at the end of the 2006/07 season. He also announced he would participate, if required, in England&#x27;s summer friendlies and the 2007 Rugby World Cup, before retiring completely from the sport. His last game for Sale Sharks came at home to Bath on Friday 13 April. Robinson said, &quot;I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Sale Sharks but the time has come to move on to other things. I want my last game for Sale Sharks to be a home game (v Bath) and want to be able to say a big thank you to the supporters of this great club.&quot;

On 13 April 2007, Robinson ended his club career with a match-winning try 6 seconds from time as Sale edged past Bath in the Guinness Premiership. In the last play of the game, he received the ball 30 metres out and could not be stopped. He was then given the opportunity to convert the try, only to miss by a matter of inches past the left post.

On 14 September 2007, Robinson left the field to a standing ovation during England&#x27;s defeat by South Africa, with a hamstring injury. This kept him out of England&#x27;s remaining two group games, but he resumed full training in time to be available to play in the knock-out stages. In the quarter-final against Australia, Robinson returned to the side as full back and played his part in a tense 12–10 victory over the Wallabies. In the semi-final victory over France, his 50th cap, he was given the honour of leading out the England team. Robinson&#x27;s last game for England came in the 2007 World Cup Final defeat by South Africa, when he was forced to leave the field during the second half, due to an injury. He was one of only four players to have started both the 2003 and 2007 Finals, the other three being Jonny Wilkinson, Ben Kay, and Phil Vickery.

Robinson was selected to play for the Barbarians at Twickenham on 1 December 2007, showing many of his trademark runs and received a standing ovation as he left the field for the last time in the 68th minute of the match.

===Fylde===

On 26 July 2010, Robinson came out of retirement at the age of 35 to play for National League 2 North side; Fylde. He announced his final retirement on 7 July 2011.

== Coaching career ==
On 5 March 2008, the RFL announced that Robinson would be returning to rugby league in a coaching capacity at grass roots level from under 8s to open age, as a dual code ambassador for the sport in association with Gillette.

On 25 February 2009 it was announced that Robinson would be re-joining Sale Sharks as the new head coach from the 2009–10 season.

==Awards==
Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours.

In March 2017, Robinson was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Lycamobile British Ethnic Diversity Sports Awards (BEDSAs) held at the London Hilton on Park Lane.

==Personal life==
He is of Scottish and Jamaican descent. His father William Thorpe, a Jamaican living in Leeds, left his mother before Robinson&#x27;s birth. Robinson and his two older brothers Bernard and George were raised by his mother and a step father. In 2003, he was reunited with his natural father again through his brother and sister. Robinson is nicknamed &#x27;Billy Whizz&#x27; after a character in the British comic &quot;The Beano&quot;, who is an extremely fast runner.

In 2012, his eldest son Lewis Tierney, who plays as a full back, signed a two-year deal with Wigan Warriors at age 18. Tierney has declared himself for Scotland. Robinson has five other children including Patrick, a professional cyclist.

After the 2003 Rugby World Cup, Robinson wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Finding My Feet: My Autobiography&quot; published by Coronet Books. In it, he wrote about how he overcame issues from his childhood and bouts of drinking when he found success as a rugby league star. In 2005, a biography, &quot;The Real Jason Robinson&quot;, written with Robinson&#x27;s full co-operation by Dave Swanton, was published by Empire Publications.

<doc id="654110" wikidata="Q1909993" url="?curid=654110" title="Wadi-us-Salaam">
<text>Wadi-us-Salaam (, , ) is an Islamic cemetery, located in the holy city of Najaf, Iraq. It is the largest cemetery in the world. The cemetery covers and contains more than 6 million bodies. It also attracts millions of pilgrims annually.

The cemetery is located near the shrine of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth Sunni Caliph, as well as the first Shia Imam. Thus, many Shi&#x27;ites in Iraq request that they be buried in this cemetery. As a result of improved transportation methods, Shi&#x27;ites from across the globe are (or seek to be) buried in the cemetery. However, to be buried at the cemetery, one has to be interred inside one of the shared crypts in the cemetery. 

==Shi&#x27;ite traditions about the cemetery==

Shi&#x27;ites traditions hold that Abraham bought land in Wadi-us-Salaam, and that Ali had said the Wadi Al-Salaam was a part of heaven. Shia also widely believe that Ali has the power to intercede for the deceased—lessening their suffering—during the passage of their soul from the worldly life and if they are buried there, they will be raised from the dead on judgment day with their spiritual leader. Additionally, it is believed that prophets Hud and Salih are buried here, according to some narrations.

Shi&#x27;ites are encouraged to bury their dead at the location through religious edicts and the cemetery&#x27;s expansion is also seen as being a result of Shi&#x27;isms &quot;more permissive attitude than Sunnism with regard to the commemoration of the dead and the erection of mausoleums.&quot;

=== Shi&#x27;ite funerary rituals ===
Religious rituals practiced at Wadi-us-Salaam before burial include:

# Washing the body and wrapping it at the cemetery. 
# Conducting funeral prayers at the adjacent shrine of Ali.
# Carrying the freshly wrapped corpse around the shrine, in an act similar to that of Tawaf, before it is transported to the cemetery. 
# Reciting some Qur&#x27;anic verses at the cemetery for the deceased.

==History==
Daily burials have been on going for over 1,400 years and the site is on the Tentative List of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage sites. Burials in Najaf have been documented as early as the Parthian and Sassanid eras and ancient Mesopotamian cities often had similar cemeteries, where there was an accumulation of tombs.

The cemetery saw heavy fighting during the 2004 Battle of Najaf. It is estimated that during the Iraq War, about 200 to 250 corpses were buried there daily; however, in 2010 this number had decreased to less than 100. Approximately 50,000 new bodies are interred in the cemetery annually from across the globe. This figure is an increase on the approximately 20,000 bodies, primarily from Iran, that used to be interred annually in the early 20th century. Most Iraqi and many Iranian Shi&#x27;ites have a relative buried in the cemetery.

As of 2014—coinciding with conflict against ISIL—it has been reported that burial plots are running out, resulting in many being stolen, illegally resold or improvised. According to one gravedigger: &quot;I&#x27;ve never had it so busy. Not even after 2003 or 2006 [the height of Iraq&#x27;s civil war].&quot;

== Important monuments ==
=== Tombs of the Grand Ayatollahs ===
The Grand Ayatollah, Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, is buried in this cemetery. His successor, Muhammad-Sadiq al-Sadr is also buried there, and his grave is one of the most visited tombs in the cemetery.

=== Shrine of Prophet Hud and Salih ===
First built in the 18th century under request of Moḥammad Mahdī Baḥr al-ʿUlūm over the purported tombs of Hud and Salih based on Shi&#x27;ite narrations. It was restored in the years 1918 to 1919 after the British desecrated it in 1917. A full new reconstruction was started in 2018.

=== Site of Imam al-Mahdi ===

<doc id="654111" wikidata="Q869794" url="?curid=654111" title="Recovery-oriented computing">
<text>Recovery-oriented computing (sometimes abbreviated to ROC) is a method constructed at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley for developing reliable Internet services. Its proponents seek to recognize computer bugs as inevitable, and then reduce their harmful effects. The National Science Foundation funds the project.

There are characteristics that set recovery oriented computing apart from all other failure handling techniques.

==Isolation and redundancy==
Isolation in these types of systems requires redundancy. Should one part of the system fail, a redundant part will need to take its place. Isolation must be failure proof for all types of failures whether they be software or human caused failures. One potential way to isolate parts of a system is using virtual machine monitors such as Xen. Virtual machine monitors allow many virtual machines to run on a physical machine and should there be a problem with one virtual machine it can be restarted without restarting the physical machine, or it can be stopped and another can take its place.

==System-wide undo support==

The ability to undo across different programs and time frames is necessary in this type of system because human error is the cause of about half of system failures. Not having undo support also limits testing aspects of a production system because it doesn’t allow for trial and error.

System-wide undo support should cover all aspects of the system. This includes hardware and software upgrades, configuration as well as application management. There are obviously limits to what can be undone, and these limits are currently being explored, tested and rated based on their tradeoffs.

==Integrated diagnostic support==
Integrated diagnostic support is another characteristic a recovery-oriented computer should have. This means that the system should be able to identify the root cause of a system failure. Once it does this it should then either be able to contain the failure so it cannot affect other parts of the system or alternatively it should repair the failure. All of the system components or modules should be self-testing; it should be able to know when there is something wrong with itself. As well as determining problems with themselves, the modules should also be able to verify the behavior of other modules that they are dependent upon. The system must also track module, resource, and user request dependencies throughout the system. This will allow for containment of failures.

==Online verification and recovery mechanisms==
Recovery mechanisms are ways in which the systems can recover from failures. These recovery mechanisms should be well designed, meaning that they are reliable, effective and efficient. These systems should be proactive in testing and verifying the behavior of the recovery mechanisms so should there be a real failure it is certain that these mechanisms will do what they are designed to do and aid in the recovery of the system. These verifications should be performed even in production level equipment as this type of equipment is the most vital to have up. There are two methods for performing these tests and both of these should be used. The first method is directed tests in which the tests are set up and executed. The other method is a random test in which they occur without warning.

==Modularity, measurability and restartability==
Software aging problems are best resolved by restarting the component that is affected. This entails both modularity and restartability. Components should be restarted before they fail, and designed to make this option available or better yet, do it automatically. Applications should also be designed for restartability.

==Benchmarks==
These systems should have frequent dependability and availability benchmarking to justify their existence and usage by tracking their progress. These benchmarks should be reproducible and an impartial measure of system dependability, reliability, and availability.

<doc id="654113" wikidata="Q394286" url="?curid=654113" title="Žumberak Mountains">
<text>The Žumberak Mountains (, , historic German name: ) is a range of hills and mountains in northwestern Croatia and southeastern Slovenia, extending from the southwest to the northeast between the Krka and the Kupa.

It covers an area of . The geographically unified massif consists of two parts, separated by the Bregana and Žumberak rivers (Croatian: ). The northeastern part is the Samobor Hills () with the foothills. The central and western part is named Žumberak Hills (Croatian: ). Its northwesternmost part, named Gorjanci, lies in Slovenia. The highest peak of the range is Sveta Gera (Trdina Peak) on the border between Croatia and Slovenia, being high. Since 1999, an area of the range in Croatia has been protected as the nature park Žumberak–Samobor Hills.

==Location==
The Žumberak Mountains lie near and partly on the border between Croatia and Slovenia, which mostly passes through the highest parts of the massif. The Croatian part of the mountain range is in Central Croatia, mostly in the western part of Zagreb County, and a smaller part is in Karlovac County. The Slovene part belongs to the traditional region of Lower Carniola. The Žumberak Mountains are situated only from the Croatian capital, Zagreb. Cities near this range are Samobor, Jastrebarsko, and Ozalj in Croatia, and Novo Mesto, Brežice, and Kostanjevica na Krki in Slovenia. 
The range is in territory of four cities:
*Samobor, Novo Mesto, Jastrebarsko, and Ozalj

and seven municipalities
* Krško, Kostanjevica na Krki, Šentjernej, Brežice, Žumberak, Krašić, and Klinča Sela.

===Border dispute===

The highest peak, Sveta Gera / Trdina Peak, is subject to a border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia. An old Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army barracks building stands there that is used as an outpost by the Slovenian Army since the 1990s, although it is recorded in the Croatian land registry, and Croatian side see this as an occupation of their land. Since then that has been a subject of a dispute between the two new countries.

The situation became more complex when the dispute nearly derailed Croatia&#x27;s application to join NATO. It escalated further with Slovenia&#x27;s blockade of Croatia&#x27;s EU accession from December 2008 until September–October 2009, when Slovenia (a European Union member state) blocked the negotiation progress of Croatia (at the time an EU candidate state). However, further escalation was prevented due to amicable diplomacy of the Croatian and Slovenian prime ministers Jadranka Kosor, and Borut Pahor.

==Speleology==
Žumberak has hundreds of limestone caves. The deepest is Gorjanc at 226 m, and the longest is Provala at 2161 m. On the Croatian side, the deepest is Dolača at 155 m.

==Flora and Funga==
There are more than 1,000 species of different plant life recorded in this area, some of which are strictly protected. In the area of the Nature Park 90 species of Croatian vascular flora from the Red Book are recorded. On the global level 3 of them are critically endangered, 11 are endangered and 28 are globally sensitive.

Forests cover huge area of the range. there are few old-growth forests mostly on the Slovene part of the highest ridge, close to Sveta Gera. These are Old-growth forest Ravna Gora, and old-growth forest on Trdina Peak. Most common are the forests of sessile oak and hornbeam and on steeper slopes are the forests of Downy Oak and hop hornbeam. Beech forests cover the highest ridges. Some endangered and protected plants are found here, such as are globally sensitive species &quot;Iris croatica&quot; and &quot;Daphne blagayana&quot;. Globally sensitive species of wild orchids and lilies can be found in areas between forests and open habitats.

There is only a small area of grassland of natural origin. The local population exploited grassland. Grassland are rich in species. In some areas more than 40 species of plants have been recorded on one square meter! Many of them are in the Red Book of vascular flora in Croatia.
The areas of damp and marsh-like grassland and plain and moors also can be found here. Important example is the area along the Jasinje creek where even 7 strongly protected and 12 protected plant species have been recorded. Among them we stress critically endangered species on global level – tall cottongrass (&quot;Eriophorum angustifolium&quot;) and alpine asphodel (&quot;Tofieldia calyculata&quot;); globally endangered species of sedges, globally sensitive species: grass-like sedge (&quot;Carex panicea&quot;) and lesser butterfly-orchid (&quot;Platanthera bifolia&quot;) and species with the status of not sufficiently explored (DD) in Croatia, elongated sedge (&quot;Carex elongata&quot;).

There are 377 species of mushrooms in the Park area. It is supposed that this is only smaller number of a total number of mushrooms in this area, In the research carried on in 2007, seven new species of mushrooms were found in Žumberak – Samoborsko gorje Nature Park. Arched woodwax (&quot;Hygrophorus camarophyllus&quot;) is on the Red List of the mushrooms in Croatia with EN category of endanger (globally endangered species).

There are 79 discovered species of lichens, three of which are on the Red List of lichens in Croatia. These are &quot;Bryoria fuscescens&quot; (with status VU – sensitive family), &quot;Lobaria pulmonaria&quot; (with status EN – endangered family) and genus &quot;Usnea&quot; (status VU). The research discovered several localities rich in lichen species like wild forest of beech in area of Kuti and wider area of Budinjak, Sv. Gera. Old orchards in grassland are explored as well.
Following families are found and put on the Red List of Croatia: &quot;Baeomyces rufus&quot; (almost endangered species – NT), &quot;Dibaeis baeomyces&quot; (VU), &quot;Lobaria pulmonaria&quot; (VU), &quot;Menegazzia terebrata&quot; (VU) and &quot;Solorina saccata&quot; (VU).

==Fauna==

Here you may see large predators as bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) and wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;). There are also numerous species of small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates. There are many birds living in this area. Some are birds of prey like goshawk, and birds living next to creeks (white-throated dipper and grey wagtail). In lower parts, the grey heron (&quot;Ardea cinerea&quot;) can be found, and, occasionally, even white stork (&quot;Ciconia ciconia&quot;). Most of amphibian and reptile species which you can find in continental Croatia, can be found here. Spotted salamander (&quot;Salamandra salamandra&quot;) is a regular inhabitant of the areas near creeks. Very rare black salamanders (&quot;Salamandra atra&quot;) can be found in higher areas. Ponds are hatching places for amphibians like toads, newts and frogs. Snakes are common here. Venomous snakes - Viper (&quot;Vipera ammodytes&quot;) and grass snake (&quot;Natrix natrix&quot;), and nonvenomous - Aesculapian snake (&quot;Elaphe longissima&quot;), smooth snake (&quot;Coronella austriaca&quot;) and dice snake (&quot;Natrix tessellata&quot;) – strictly protected species listed on the Red List. The commonest lizard is wall lizard (&quot;Podarcis muralis&quot;), slow-worm (&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;), European green lizard (&quot;Lacerta viridis&quot;) and common lizard (&quot;Lacerta vivipara&quot;).

There are 21 species of fish, from 8 families. They live in river Kupa, Kupčina, and other rivers and creeks in the area. Some of them are &quot;Eudontomyzon vladykovi&quot;, &quot;Squalius cephalus&quot; and &quot;Cobitis elongata&quot;.
Brown trout are common due to suitable ecological conditions (water temperature, quantity of oxygen and creeks&#x27; speed).

&quot;Austropotamobius torrentium&quot;, the stone crayfish, can be found in creeks, although very rarely. There are numerous invertebrates which enrich biological diversity of the area. Many are endangered. However, due to insufficient research, not all are recorded. The most endangered is &quot;Phengaris rebeli&quot;. There are numerous species of invertebrates, in caves and holes, that have not been explored yet. There are bats as well – the most endangered mammal. Recent exploration of karstic underground in the Park discovered some species of arthropods, which are completely new in science.

==History==

===Prehistoric times===

====Eneolithic====
The earliest artefacts in the Žumberak Mountains, small axe, and fragments of a pot, were found in the village of Mrzlo Polje Žumberačko. They belong to the people of Baden culture (Lasinya culture).

====Iron Age====
There is a large archaeological survey in Budinjak. Large settlement and a necropolis with 140 tumuli were discovered. One of the most important findings is bronze, &quot;Kneževa kaciga&quot; (&quot;Prince&#x27;s Helmet&quot;), found in one of two biggest tumuli, with diameter of 19 meters . Today it is in Archaeological Museum in Zagreb. This is a proof that Budinjak was a settlement with powerful economy which had contacts with faraway lands.

In late Iron Age, the Celtic tribes started conquering and colonizing this part of Europe. It is presumed that they had many settlements in the Žumberak Mountains, since mint was discovered in Samobor. Under the Okić castle, in the forest of Jama near Podgrađe, a man found 1600 silver Celtic coins. These coins are now called &quot;Samobors&quot;.

===Roman period===
In 35 - 33 BC the Žumberak Mountains became part of the Roman Republic, later empire, province of Pannonia. The most important remains are several graveyards dating from 1st century AD found in the central Žumberak Mountains, in villages of Gornja Vas and Bratelji. People buried in those graveyards belonged to the Celtic tribe of Latobics. Many glass containers were found in these graves. These containers were produced in northern Italy, and they are proof that people in the Žumberak Mountains had a powerful economy at that time.

===Middle Ages===
After the decline of the Roman Empire, numerous Germanic and Slavic tribes passed across the Pannonian Plain. Almost nothing is known when the Croats came to the Žumberak Mountains. The earliest written texts and archaeological finds enlighten the history of the Žumberak Mountains from the 12th century on. At that time the Žumberak Mountains were the border between the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom and the Holy Roman Empire.

===Early modern period===
Colonization of Žumberak with Vlachs and Uskoks begins 1526.

===Uskoks===
The isolated region on the Croatian side has always had a low population. In 1530, the immigration of Uskoks started, which lasted until the 17th century, which brought a large population of Štokavian speakers to the region. The Žumberak Mountains were then part of Austrian Military Frontier, created by the Habsburgs to serve as a defensive buffer between their empire and the Ottoman Empire. Uskoks from this area, were the only military personnel on the Military frontier, that weren&#x27;t living close to the border itself, the Žumberak Mountains themselves were an enclave within Banovina and did not directly border the Ottoman Empire, so they had to walk for half a day or longer to their posts in Ogulin, Cazin, Bihać etc. 500 Uskoks from the Žumberak Mountains fought in the Battle of Sisak. They had huge losses for their standard, losing 40 soldiers in crucial mission of taking over the bridge over Odra river.
In the year 1545. they were called by citizens of Zagreb, to defend the city from the Ottomans because the regular army under the leadership of Croatian Ban was heavily defeated in Hrvatsko Zagorje. As we know Zagreb was never occupied by the Ottomans.

====Language====
Because of the immigration of Uskoks, the region is the intersection of all three Croatian dialects. The descendants of Uskoks who are Štokavian speakers are the majority in the Žumberak Mountains.

===Mass emigrations===
Mass emigrations started in the 19th century, when Military frontier was disestablished. People in the Žumberak Mountains were no longer needed in the army. Since army salaries, which were main source of wealth, were not coming any more to the Žumberak Mountains. This was the main reason why people fell to poverty and started immigrating to the United States.

===World War II===
World War II in Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941 with the invasion by Nazi Germany. Soon after that, the Croatian part of the Žumberak Mountains became a part of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany and Italy, with the western part being directly occupied by Italy. The Slovenian part was annexed directly to the Third Reich. The resistance movement in the Žumberak Mountains began when Partisans from 1st Zagreb Partisan Detachment came to this area. Matija Gubec Partisan detachment was established here in August 1941, However it was quickly destroyed. In 1942 partisans from Kordun managed to attract local people to join the resistance, so in 1942 Žumberak-Pokuplje partisan detachment was established. Later they merged with First Croatian proleterian battalion in famous XIII. proletarian brigade Rade Končar. That brigade managed to liberate Krašić in January 1943, which was a great victory for Partisan movement, since North-West Croatia was considered to be NDH stronghold. Many villages were completely burned and destroyed by the fascists, because their inhabitants allegedly helped the partisans. Žumberak was finally liberated on 9 May 1945, by the 10th division of Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army.

The Žumberak Mountains are the site of the Jazovka Pit, location of a World War II massacre of retreating Ustasha soldiers and civilians mostly from hospitals in Zagreb by the communists, not partisans from Žumberak-Pokuplje partisan detachment, or local people.

===In SFRY===
In the nineteen-sixties and nineteen-seventies, the second mass emigration started, mostly to Germany. Žumberak-Gorjanci memorial area was established in 1971.

===Modern Croatia===

In 1991 area of the Žumberak Mountains became a part of independent Croatia and Slovenia. A military complex near the top of Trdina Peak, created by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, has been a subject of a dispute between the two new countries since the 1990s because it is held by the Slovenian army, but the complex is actually located on Croatian soil. Escalation was prevented due to amicable diplomacy.

==Conservation and threats==
The greatest threats to the range are deforestation and illegal dumping. Some argue that the Krško Nuclear Power Plant threatens the northern parts of the range, but there is no proof of this. Most of the Croatian part of the range was protected as the Žumberak–Samoborsko Gorje Nature Park by the Parliament of Croatia on 28 May 1999, and since 2012 it has been a Natura 2000 site. Some areas inside the park itself are specially protected.
