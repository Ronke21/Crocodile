<text>Jessie Redmon Fauset (April 27, 1882 – April 30, 1961) was an editor, poet, essayist, novelist, and educator. Her literary work helped sculpt African-American literature in the 1920s as she focused on portraying a true image of African-American life and history. Her black fictional characters were working professionals which was an inconceivable concept to American society during this time. Her story lines related to themes of racial discrimination, &quot;passing&quot;, and feminism.

From 1919 to 1926, Fauset&#x27;s position as literary editor of &quot;The Crisis&quot;, an NAACP magazine, allowed her to contribute to the Harlem Renaissance by promoting literary work that related to the social movements of this era. Through her work as a literary editor and reviewer, she encouraged black writers to represent the African-American community realistically and positively.

Before and after working on &quot;The Crisis,&quot; she worked for decades as a French teacher in public schools in Washington, DC, and New York City. She published four novels during the 1920s and 1930s, exploring the lives of the black middle class. She also was the editor and co-author of the African-American children&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book&quot;.

She is known for discovering and mentoring other African-American writers, including Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer, Countee Cullen, and Claude McKay.

==Life and work==
She was born Jessie Redmona Fauset (later known as Jessie Redmon Fauset) on April 27, 1882, in Fredericksville, Camden County, Snow Hill Center Township, New Jersey (now known as Lawnside, New Jersey).

She was the seventh child of Redmon Fauset, an African Methodist Episcopal minister, and Annie (née Seamon) Fauset. Jessie&#x27;s mother died when she was young, and her father remarried. He had three children with his second wife Bella, a white Jewish woman who converted to Christianity. Bella brought three children to the family from her first marriage. Both parents emphasized education for their children. Civil rights activist and anthropologist Arthur Fauset was her half-brother. Her father died when she was young; two of her half-siblings were still under the age of five. She attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls, the city&#x27;s top academic school. She graduated as valedictorian of her class and likely the school&#x27;s first African-American graduate. She wanted to study at Bryn Mawr College, and the valedictorian of Girls&#x27; High was traditionally awarded a scholarship to the college. However, Bryn Mawr president M. Carey Thomas raised money for Fauset to attend Cornell University instead. Carey Thomas would prevent any black or Jewish students from attending Bryn Mawr during her tenure.

She continued her education at Cornell University in upstate New York, graduating in 1905 with a degree in classical languages. During her time at Cornell University in 1903 through part of 1904, Fauset lived at Sage College. She would win Phi Beta Kappa honors. For many years she was considered to be the first black woman accepted to Phi Beta Kappa society, but later research revealed this was actually Mary Annette Anderson. Fauset later received her master&#x27;s degree in French from the University of Pennsylvania (1919).

Following college, Fauset became a teacher at Dunbar High School (then named as M Street High School), the academic high school for black students in Washington, DC, which had a segregated public school system. She taught French and Latin, and went to Paris for the summers to study at la Sorbonne.

In 1919, Fauset left teaching to become the literary editor for &quot;The Crisis,&quot; founded by W. E. B. Du Bois of the NAACP. She served in that position until 1926. Fauset became a member of the NAACP and represented them in the Pan African Congress in 1921. After her Congress speech, the Delta Sigma Theta sorority made her an honorary member.

In 1926, Fauset left &quot;The Crisis&quot; and returned to teaching, this time at DeWitt Clinton High School in New York City, where she may have taught a young James Baldwin. She taught in New York City public schools until 1944.

In 1929, when she was 47, Fauset married for the first time, to insurance broker Herbert Harris. They moved from New York City to Montclair, New Jersey, where they led a quieter life. Harris died in 1958. She moved back to Philadelphia with her step-brother, one of Bella&#x27;s children. Fauset died on April 30, 1961, from heart disease and is interred at Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania.

==Literary editor at &quot;The Crisis&quot;==
Jessie Fauset&#x27;s time with &quot;The Crisis&quot; is considered the most prolific literary period of the magazine&#x27;s run. In July 1918, Fauset became a contributor to &quot;The Crisis,&quot; sending articles for the &quot;Looking Glass&quot; column from her home in Philadelphia. By the next July, managing editor W. E. B. Du Bois requested she move to New York to become the full-time Literary Editor. By October, she was installed in the &quot;Crisis&quot; office, where she quickly took over most organizational duties.

As Literary Editor, Fauset fostered the careers of many of the most well-known authors of the Harlem Renaissance, including Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Nella Larsen, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Anne Spencer, George Schuyler, Arna Bontemps, and Langston Hughes. Fauset was the first person to publish Hughes. As editor of &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book,&quot; the children&#x27;s magazine of &quot;The Crisis,&quot; she had included a few of his early poems. In his memoir &quot;The Big Sea,&quot; Hughes wrote, &quot;Jessie Fauset at &quot;The Crisis,&quot; Charles Johnson at &quot;,&quot; and Alain Locke in Washington were the people who midwifed the so-called New Negro Literature into being.&quot;

Beyond nurturing the careers of other African-American modernist writers, Fauset was also a prolific contributor to both &quot;The Crisis&quot; and &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book.&quot; During her time with &quot;The Crisis,&quot; she contributed poems and short stories, as well as a novella, translations from the French of writings by black authors from Europe and Africa, and a multitude of editorials. She also published accounts of her extensive travels. Notably, Fauset included five essays, including &quot;Dark Algiers the White,&quot; detailing her six-month journey with Laura Wheeler Waring to France and Algeria in 1925 and 1926.

After eight years serving as Literary Editor, Fauset found that conflicts between her and Du Bois were taking their toll. In February 1927, she resigned her position. She was listed as a &quot;Contributing Editor&quot; the next month.

After leaving the magazine, Fauset concentrated on writing novels, while supporting herself through teaching. From 1927 to 1944, she taught French at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, while continuing to publish novels.

==Novels==
Between 1924 and 1933, Fauset published four novels: &quot;There is Confusion&quot; (1924), &quot;Plum Bun&quot; (1928), &quot;The Chinaberry Tree&quot; (1931), and &quot;Comedy, American Style&quot; (1933). She believed that T. S. Stribling&#x27;s novel &quot;Birthright,&quot; written by a white man about black life, could not fully portray her people. Fauset thought there was a dearth of positive depictions of African-American lives in contemporary literature. She was inspired to portray African-American life both as realistically, and as positively, as possible, and wrote about the middle-class life she knew of as an educated person. At the same time, she worked to explore contemporary issues of identity among African Americans, including issues related to the community&#x27;s assessment of skin color. Many were of mixed race with some European ancestry.

The Great Migration resulted in many African Americans moving to industrial cities; in some cases, individuals used this change as freedom to try on new identities. Some used partial European ancestry and appearance to pass as white, for temporary convenience or advantage: for instance, to get better service in a store or restaurant, or to gain a job. Others entered white society nearly permanently to take advantage of economic and social opportunities, sometimes leaving darker-skinned relatives behind. This issue was explored by other writers of the Harlem Renaissance in addition to Fauset, who was herself light-skinned and visibly of mixed race. Vashti Crutcher Lewis, in an essay entitled &quot;Mulatto Hegemony in the Novels of Jessie Redmon Fauset&quot;, suggests that Fauset&#x27;s novels illustrate the evidence of a color hierarchy with lighter-skinned blacks enjoying more privilege.&quot;

* &quot;There is Confusion&quot; was widely praised upon release. In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Ernest Boyd wrote: &quot;Compared with the ordinary story of negro life Jessie Redmon Fauset&#x27;s &quot;There is Confusion&quot; assumes the proportions of an important book; it is well executed, so well, in fact, that no Ku Kluxer could stand it.&quot; Alain Locke wrote in &quot;The Crisis&quot;: &quot;[H]ere in refreshing contrast with the bulk of fiction about the Negro, we have a novel of the educated and aspiring classes.&quot; This novel traces the family histories of Joanna Mitchell and Peter Bye, who must each come to terms with their complex racial histories.
* &quot;Plum Bun&quot; has warranted the most critical attention. It explores the theme of &quot;passing&quot;. The mixed-race protagonist, Angela Murray, who has partial European ancestry, passes for white in order to gain some advantages. In the course of the novel, she eventually reclaims her African-American identity.
* &quot;The Chinaberry Tree&quot; has not received much critical attention. Set in New Jersey, this novel explores the longing for &quot;respectability&quot; among the contemporary African-American middle class. The protagonist Laurentine seeks to overcome her &quot;bad blood&quot; through marriage to a &quot;decent&quot; man. Ultimately, Laurentine must redefine &quot;respectable&quot; as she finds her own sense of identity.
* &quot;Comedy, American Style,&quot; Fauset&#x27;s last novel, explores the destructive power of &quot;color mania&quot; among African Americans, some of whom discriminated within the black community on the basis of skin color. The protagonist&#x27;s mother Olivia brings about the downfall of the other characters due to her own such internalized racism.

== Contemporary reviews ==
Fauset was admired by many literary intellectuals during the 1920s. Her first novel, &quot;There is Confusion,&quot; was applauded by Alain Locke in the 1924 February issue of the &quot;Crisis&quot;. Locke felt the novel would &quot;mark an epoch&quot; because he believed it was educated literary material that the educated reader anticipated as it shone light on a higher class of black people rather than the usual &quot;servant&quot; type of character that was portrayed in past literature. In the 1924 June academic journal &quot;&quot;, Howard University professor Montgomery Gregory gave praise to Fauset&#x27;s work because he felt she made clear of the &quot;better elements&quot; of African-American life &quot;to those who know us only as domestic servants, &#x27;uncles&#x27;, or criminals&quot;. Although Fauset received many positive reviews on her literary work in the 1920s, she also faced negative feedback as well. Her new literary perspective was not received with open arms by everyone because it went against the stereotypical image white Americans made of middle-class African Americans. The first publisher ever to see the &quot;There is Confusion&quot; manuscript rejected it, saying that &quot;white readers just don’t expect negroes to be like this&quot;. Despite the mixed discussion on Fauset&#x27;s work in the 1920s, by the 1930s people stopped talking about her and she became a forgotten writer. Locke felt that the reason people stopped talking about Fauset was due to a change in the literary scene because of the Great Depression and Second World War.

== Current scholarship ==
It was not until after the 1970s, a period of a feminist movement, that Fauset began to regain praise. In 1981, author Carolyn Wedin Sylvander wrote a book about Fauset, &quot;Jessie Redmon Fauset, Black American Writer&quot;, which analyses and shows great appreciation of her novels, short stories and poems. Other critics such as Wilbert Jenkins acknowledge Fauset in his 1986 essay &quot;Jessie Fauset: A Modern Apostle of Black Racial Pride&quot; for showing &quot;awareness of African American cultural history&quot; and demonstrating how to celebrate &quot;black identity&quot;. Jenkins also argues that Fauset is alongside other early black feminists because in addition to focusing on racial identity, she explores &quot;female consciousness&quot;. Fauset is recognized today as an important contributor to the Harlem Renaissance. American and African-American literature professor Ann duCille compares Fauset to other Harlem Renaissance writers such as Nella Larsen for expressing feminism in her literary work.

<text>Adventure racing (also called expedition racing) is typically a multidisciplinary team sport involving navigation over an unmarked wilderness course with races extending anywhere from two hours up to two weeks in length. Some races offer solo competitions as well. The principal disciplines in adventure racing include trekking, mountain biking, and paddling although races can incorporate a multitude of other disciplines including climbing, abseiling, horse riding, skiing and white water rafting. Teams generally vary in gender and in size from two to five competitors, however, the main format is considered to be mixed-gender teams of four racers. There is typically no suspension of the clock during races, irrespective of length; elapsed competition time runs concurrently with real-time, and competitors must choose if or when to rest.

== Origin ==
The roots of adventure racing are deep and the origin of the modern adventure race is debatable. Some point to the two-day Karrimor International Mountain Marathon, first held in 1968 as the birth of modern adventure racing. The Karrimor Marathon required two-person teams to traverse mountainous terrain while carrying all the supplies required to support themselves through the double-length marathon run.

In 1980, the Alpine Ironman was held in New Zealand. Individual competitors ran, paddled, and skied toward a distant finish line. Later that year, the Alpine Ironman&#x27;s creator, Robin Judkins launched the better-known Coast to Coast race. This involved most of the elements of modern adventure racing: trail running, cycling and paddling. Australia&#x27;s two-day WildTrek ran from 1981 through 2005.

Independently in 1982, the first expedition-length adventure race, a week-long, North American event called the Alaska Mountain Wilderness Classic debuted. It involved wilderness travel—no roads, no pack animals, and no support team to carry food and equipment from start to finish—with less than 50 of its 150-mile length on a trail. It continues today, changing courses every three years.

== Modern adventure racing ==
In 1989, the modern era of adventure racing arrived with Gerald Fusil&#x27;s launch of the Raid Gauloises in New Zealand. Inspired by the Paris-Dakar Rally, Fusil envisioned an expanded expedition-style race in which competitors would rely on their own strength and abilities to traverse great and challenging terrain. The race included all the modern elements of adventure racing, including mixed-gender teams competing in a multi-day 400+ mile race. Building on Fusil&#x27;s concept, the inaugural Southern Traverse was held in 1991.

In the early 1990s, Mark Burnett read a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article about Raid Gauloises and was inspired to compete and bring the race to the USA and promote the race as a major televised sporting event. After purchasing the rights from Gerald Fusil, Burnett launched the first &quot;Eco-Challenge&quot; race in 1995. Burnett promoted his event with Emmy-award-winning films (tapping the talent of Mike Sears to produce the films for the first two events). This incarnation of Eco-Challenge was last held in 2002 when Burnett shifted his focus to Survivor, the Contender, the Apprentice and other reality-based television shows. With the Eco-Challenge also came the name &quot;adventure race&quot;, a phrase coined by journalist and author Martin Dugard, to describe the class of races embodied by the Raid and Eco-Challenge.
The United States Adventure Racing Association &quot;USARA&quot; was formed in 1998. The USARA was the first &quot;national governing body&quot; for the sport of adventure racing and arose from the need for safety standards, insurance and to promote the growth of adventure racing in the United States. USARA has added national rankings, a national championship, and ecological standards to the list of benefits provided for the sport of adventure racing.

In 2000, the inaugural United States Adventure Racing Association Adventure Race National Championship was held in Kernville, California. The USARA National Championship is typically held the first weekend in October and is considered the premier adventure race in the U.S. The USARA Adventure Racing National Championship has continued each year drawing the best US teams for a chance at earning the title of national champion. The National Points Series Champion is also awarded at the National Championship.

In 2001, the inaugural World Championships were held in Switzerland with Team Nokia Adventure crossing the finishing line first. The concept of a world championship lay dormant until it was revived in 2004, with Canada&#x27;s Raid the North Extreme serving as the AR World Championship event in Newfoundland &amp; Labrador. The Adventure Racing World Series and its ultimate event, the AR World Championships have been held every year since. The 2013 World Championships were in Costa Rica, 2014 in Ecuador, 2015 in Brazil, 2016 in Australia, 2017 in the United States, and 2018 off the coast of Africa on the Reunion Island.
In 2004, professional geologist Stjepan Pavicic organized the first Patagonian Expedition Race at the bottom tip of the American continent, in the Chilean Tierra del Fuego. Truly demanding routes through rough terrain of often more than 600 km soon made it be known as &quot;the last wild race&quot;.

In 2010, the German Adventure Race Series was held for the first time in three different locations all over Germany. Since then the popularity of the sport in Germany has grown every year. More races and venues have joined the series and the number of competitors are still growing from year to year. Competitors can start in teams of two (male, female or mixed) within the categories Master (15–20 h), Challenger (8–10 h) or Beginner (4–6 h).

In 2010 in Australia, Adventure Junkie company was launched. It formed a grassroots movement to help promote and expand the sport of Adventure Racing in Australia. They have started a series of short sprint races and longer expedition-style events up to 48-hour events. 

In 2012, Commander Forer of the Royal Navy organized the first Sea-land navigation discipline race the Solent Amphibious Challenge. The race demanded the competitors split up between sailing, running, and cycling in parts of the race and rendezvous at the end, and sail the yacht to the finish line.

In December 2017, the Adventure Racing Cooperative (ARC) was launched in the United States. It was formed in a grassroots movement to help promote and expand the sport of Adventure Racing in the United States. ARC is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit business.

In June 2018 Eco-Challenge announced it would re-launch in 2019 with Bear Grylls and the original production team

In December 2018 launched Warrior Adventure Racing in the US and has become one the largest event groups in the World with adventure races like the famous &quot;Sea to Sea Expedition Race&quot; across Florida, Expedition Alaska and Expedition Colorado.

== Race types ==
===Lengths===
*12-Hour: a six- to twelve-hour race, featuring limited navigation and orienteering.
*24-Hour: a race lasting between 18-30+ hours, typically involving UTM-based (Universal Transverse Mercator) navigation. Often basic rope work is involved (e.g., traverses or rappels). 24-hour and longer races used to require that competitors employ a support crew to transport gear from place to place. Most races these days do not permit support crews, with race organizers transporting gear bins to designated checkpoints for racers.
*Expedition: Three- to 11-day race (or longer), involving all the challenges of a multi-day race, but often with additional disciplines (e.g., horseback riding, unusual paddling events, extensive mountaineering and rope work).
*Multi-day: a 36–48+ hour race, involving advanced navigation and route choice; sleep deprivation becomes a significant factor.
*Sprint: typically a two- to six-hour race, featuring minimal navigation and occasionally involving games or special tests of agility or cunning.
*Staged Multi-day: Multiple 2-5 days of varying length, but every night the race time is stopped and competitors can recover and sleep.

===Disciplines===
The majority of adventure races include trail running, mountain biking, and a paddling event. Navigation and rope work are also featured in all but the shortest races. Races often feature:

*Beasts of Burden: Horses and camels;
*Catching Air: Paragliding, hang-gliding;
*Covering Terrain: Orienteering, mountaineering, coasteering, caving, swimming, canyoneering, riverboarding;
*Learning the Ropes: Ascending; rappelling, traversing (including via zip-line).
*Paddling: kayaks, canoes, out-riggers, rafts and tubing;
*Traveling on wheels: Mountain Bikes, kick-scooters, in-line skates, roller skates;

<doc id="639540" wikidata="Q375159" url="?curid=639540" title="Indoctrination">
<text>Indoctrination is the process of inculcating (teaching by repeated instruction) a person or people into an ideology, often avoiding critical analysis. It can refer to a general process of socialization. The term often implies forms of brainwashing or disagreeable forms of socialization. However, it can refer to both positive and negative forms of cultural transmission, and some academics consider it an integral element of education.

The precise boundary between education and indoctrination is contested. The concept originally referred to education, but after World War I, the term took on a pejorative meaning akin to brainwashing or propaganda (popular among Flat Earth cultists). Some distinguish indoctrination from education on the basis that the indoctrinated person is expected not to question or critically examine the doctrine they have learned. As such the term may be used pejoratively or as a buzz word, often in the context of political opinions, theology, religious dogma or anti-religious convictions. 

Common vectors of indoctrination include the state, educational institutions, the arts, culture, and the media. Understood as a process of socialization into “ideal-type” citizens, indoctrination takes place in both democratic and authoritarian systems of government.

==Political context==

In the political context, indoctrination is often analyzed as a tool of class warfare, where institutions of the state are identified as &quot;conspiring&quot; to maintain the status quo. Specifically the public educational system, the police, and mental health establishment are a commonly cited &quot;modus operandi&quot; of public pacification. In the extreme, an entire state can be implicated. George Orwell&#x27;s book &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; famously singled out explicit, state-mandated propaganda initiatives of totalitarian regimes. For example, the Nazi influence in Germany during World War II is an instance of government indoctrination through all forms of public life, including education, politics, and culture. In fact, following World War II, democratic nations sought to counteract the Nazi indoctrination in Germany through the process of re-education, mobilizing education as a way to reinstate new ideas of democracy and Western ideals. The process of American re-education included initiatives for the denazification of American-occupied Germany that also resulted in the indoctrination of German society with a &quot;collective guilt phenomenon&quot; to take accountability for World War II. Opinions differ on whether other forms of government are less doctrinaire, or merely achieve the same ends through less obvious methods.

==Religious indoctrination==
Religious indoctrination, the original sense of &quot;indoctrination&quot;, refers to a process of imparting doctrine in an authoritative way, as in catechism. Most religious groups among the revealed religions instruct new members in the principles of the religion; this is now not usually referred to as &quot;indoctrination&quot; by the religions themselves, in part because of the negative connotations the word has acquired. Mystery religions require a period of indoctrination before granting access to esoteric knowledge. (cf. Information security)
As a pejorative term, &quot;indoctrination&quot; implies forcibly or coercively causing people to act and think on the basis of a certain ideology. Some secular critics believe that all religions indoctrinate their adherents, as children, and the accusation is made in the case of religious extremism. Sects such as Scientology use personality tests and peer pressures to indoctrinate new members. Some religions have commitment ceremonies for children 13 years and younger, such as Bar Mitzvah, Confirmation, and Shichi-Go-San. In Buddhism, temple boys are encouraged to follow the faith while young. Some critics of religion, such as Richard Dawkins, maintain that the children of religious parents are often unfairly indoctrinated.

==Ideological indoctrination==
Indoctrination can occur in non-religious or anti-religious contexts. For example, during the 20th Century, the former People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania and the former Soviet Union instituted programs of government-sponsored atheistic indoctrination in order to promote state atheism, specifically Marxist–Leninist atheism, within their citizenry. Sabrina P. Ramet, a professor of political science, documented that &quot;from kindergarten onward children [were] indoctrinated with an aggressive form of atheism&quot; and &quot;to denounce parents who follow religious practices at home.&quot; However, after the death of Albania&#x27;s leader, Enver Hoxha in 1985, his successor, Ramiz Alia, adopted a relatively tolerant stance toward religious practice, referring to it as &quot;a personal and family matter.&quot; Émigré clergymen were permitted to reenter the country in 1988 and officiate at religious services. Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian, visited Tirana in 1989, where she was received by the foreign minister and by Hoxha&#x27;s widow. In December 1990, the ban on religious observance was officially lifted, in time to allow thousands of Christians to attend Christmas services (see Freedom of religion in Albania).

Similarly, in the former Soviet Union, &quot;science education [in] Soviet schools [was] used as a vehicle for atheistic indoctrination&quot;, with teachers being instructed to prepare their course &quot;so as to conduct anti-religious educations at all times,&quot; in order to comport with state-sanctioned Marxist–Leninist values. However, in 1997, several years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian government passed a law recognizing religion as being important to Russian history with Orthodox Christianity (Russian: Православие Pravoslaviye), Russia&#x27;s traditional and largest religion, declared a part of Russia&#x27;s &quot;historical heritage.&quot;

Ideological indoctrination is also a contemporary issue in the United States public education system, specifically in the realm of social science instruction. However, ideological indoctrination may take different forms than the implantation of certain ideas into education or instruction. For example, in this case, indoctrination through education occurs through the process of limiting instruction and &quot;allowing diverse social institutions to control educational philosophy and procedure.&quot; For example, this has been seen through changes with required course concepts in social studies curriculum and the state-restriction of participatory civic education as a result of Senate Bill 3 from the Texas State Legislature in 2021, interfering with the &quot;rights of the learner&quot;

==Military==

The initial psychological preparation of soldiers during training is referred to (non-pejoratively) as indoctrination.

==Information security==
In the field of information security, indoctrination is the initial briefing and instructions given before a person is granted access to secret information.

<text>The Yelwa massacre was a series of related incidents of religious violence between Muslims and Christians which took place in Yelwa, Nigeria between February and May 2004. These incidents killed over 700 people. The first occurred on 4 February 2004 when armed Muslims attacked the Christians of Yelwa, killing more than 78 Christians, including at least 48 who were worshipping inside a church compound. According to some sources, the signal for the attack was a call for Jihad from the local mosque.

The February killings inflamed tensions between the communities which had been growing since the 2001 Jos riots when conflict between Muslims and Christians resulted in 1,000 dead. On 2 May 2004 local Christians responded to the February incident by attacking Muslims in Yelwa, resulting in roughly 630 dead. According to some sources, Muslim girls were forced to eat pork and other foods forbidden to Muslims and some were even raped.

== Background ==
Thousands of people have died in fighting since the passage of Sharia law in the Muslim-dominated northern region after a return to civilian rule in 1999. The origin of the conflict between the Christian Tarok and the Muslim Fulani is rooted in their competing claims over the fertile farmlands of Plateau State in central Nigeria.

<doc id="639549" wikidata="Q3496946" url="?curid=639549" title="Star Académie">
<text>Star Académie is a Canadian reality television series that started in 2003, aimed primarily at the Quebec television audience, featuring an array of young women and men under the age of 30 competing for the title of the next solo singing sensation. It is the French-Canadian adaptation of the French television show &quot;Star Academy&quot; produced by Dutch company Endemol, based on the Spanish format called &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot;.

There have been seasons in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2009, and 2012. In June 2019, TVA stated that a reboot for &quot;Star Académie&quot; was possible. Two months later, the network announced that the reboot is set for early 2021. On September 22, 2020, it was announced that singer Patrice Michaud would take over Julie Snyder as host for the 2021 season. In June 2021, Michaud stated that he would not return as host for the following season. In August 2021, it was announced that singer-songwriter Marc Dupré would replace Michaud as host in 2022.

==Description==
It is aired for two months (February to April) on the TVA network. Hosted by Julie Snyder, the show is a competition to find the best young francophone singer, not only in Quebec, but also in French-speaking regions of Canada, having auditions in Ontario (Eastern Ontario) and New Brunswick (l&#x27;Acadie). Then fourteen people (seven of each gender) are chosen to compete in front of the cameras.

It is separated in two simultaneous formats: each day during the week, a show presents moments of the life and training in the common house of the &quot;Académiciens&quot; and each weekend sees one &quot;Gala&quot; show where the contenders sing. At each of these &quot;Galas&quot;, some participants are put on the line and one is chosen to stay by the public and by the judging panel.

It proved to be immensely popular, drawing not only viewership, but genuine affection from the public for the young idealistic contenders. Pride also arises for the regions where the participants are from, like pride was felt by many from the Acadian people when Wilfred Le Bouthillier, from Acadia, was chosen for the competition and later crowned winner of the first, 2003 edition.

It has also proved to be an effective springboard for the singing careers of some of its past participants, like 2003 finalists Wilfred Le Bouthillier, who recorded with the help of renowned Cajun singer Zachary Richard, and Marie-Élaine Thibert, who also released an album and sung for the soundtrack of Léa Pool&#x27;s movie &quot;The Blue Butterfly&quot;.

The show was on a 4-year hiatus due to the second pregnancy of the hostess and her busy schedule with &quot;Le Banquier&quot;, the French-Canadian version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;.

==Origins==
It is inspired by the French show &quot;Star Academy&quot; and is similar to the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot; phenomena. The name was francized for its Quebec adaptation because of the local importance given to the respect of the French language. However, it does create a grammatically impossible phrase in French. The proper translation would be &quot;Académie des stars&quot;, although this could be considered less &quot;catchy&quot;. Francization is typically given even more importance in Quebec French than in France itself (see &quot;Office québécois de la langue française&quot;).

A relatively small, but notable difference in the show format from its French counterpart is the selection process. Each week, the French version asks the public and judging panel to vote for which one, out of the contenders &quot;in danger&quot;, should be excluded from the show. The results are announced live, on stage, to the excluded member and the viewers. While this formula was followed in the beginning for &quot;Star Académie&quot;, it soon was changed because of protests, for the system was seen as cruel treatment to the excluded participant. On one early show, singer Daniel Boucher quit the studio halfway through the show because of this impression. Consequently, the public and judges are now asked to vote for the participant to &quot;remain&quot; at the &quot;Académie&quot;. In all seasons, the results are announced live.

==Criticism==
&quot;Star Académie&quot; drew criticism for the capitalist and vertical integration strategies of producing megacompany Quebecor to publicize the show and make it profitable. For example, each vote from the public costs one dollar, the website is in large part reserved to paying members and the Quebecor company, massive owner of many Quebec media, heavily promoted the show via TVA (its own television network), all of its magazines and newspapers like &quot;7 Jours&quot; and &quot;Journal de Montréal&quot;. The voting method was changed for the 2025 season, where people can vote for free via TVAd website.Astral Media&#x27;s &quot;RockDétente&quot; also did a lot of heavy promoting themselves during the 2005 edition, as the official stations of &quot;Star Académie&quot;. Also were criticized the &quot;instant celebrity machine&quot; and supposed lack of artistic integrity aspects of the whole enterprise.

<doc id="639553" wikidata="Q41485" url="?curid=639553" title="Eugène Charles Catalan">
<text>Eugène Charles Catalan (; 30 May 1814 – 14 February 1894) was a French and Belgian mathematician who worked on continued fractions, descriptive geometry, number theory and combinatorics. His notable contributions included discovering a periodic minimal surface in the space formula_1; stating the famous Catalan&#x27;s conjecture, which was eventually proved in 2002; and introducing the Catalan numbers to solve a combinatorial problem.

== Biography ==

Catalan was born in Bruges (now in Belgium, then under Dutch rule even though the Kingdom of the Netherlands had not yet been formally instituted), the only child of a French jeweller by the name of Joseph Catalan, in 1814. In 1825, he traveled to Paris and learned mathematics at École Polytechnique, where he met Joseph Liouville (1833). In December 1834 he was expelled along with most of the students in his year as part of a crackdown by the July Monarchy against republican tendencies among the students. He resumed his studies in January 1835, graduated that summer, and went on to teach at Châlons-sur-Marne. Catalan came back to the École Polytechnique, and, with the help of Liouville, obtained his degree in mathematics in 1841. He went on to Charlemagne College to teach descriptive geometry. Though he was politically active and strongly left-wing, leading him to participate in the 1848 Revolution, he had an animated career and also sat in the France&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies. Later, in 1849, Catalan was visited at his home by the French Police, searching for illicit teaching material; however, none was found.

The University of Liège appointed him chair of analysis in 1865. In 1879, still in Belgium, he became journal editor where he published as a foot note Paul-Jean Busschop&#x27;s theory after refusing it in 1873 - letting Busschop know that it was too empirical. In 1883, he worked for the Belgian Academy of Science in the field of number theory. He died in Liège, Belgium where he had received a chair.

== Work ==
He worked on continued fractions, descriptive geometry, number theory and combinatorics. He gave his name to a unique surface (periodic minimal surface in the space formula_1) that he discovered in 1855. Before that, he had stated the famous Catalan&#x27;s conjecture, which was published in 1844 and was eventually proved in 2002, by the Romanian mathematician Preda Mihăilescu. He introduced the Catalan numbers to solve a combinatorial problem (although these were actually discovered a century earlier by the Chinese astronomer Minggatu).

<text>Yinglong () is a winged dragon and rain deity in ancient Chinese mythology.

==Name==
This legendary creature&#x27;s name combines &quot;yìng&quot; &quot;respond; correspond; answer; reply; agree; comply; consent; promise; adapt; apply&quot; and &quot;lóng&quot; &quot;Chinese dragon&quot;. Although the former character is also pronounced (with a different tone) &quot;yīng&quot; &quot;should; ought to; need to; proper; suitable&quot;, &quot;yinglong&quot; definitively means &quot;responsive dragon; responding dragon&quot; and not &quot;proper dragon&quot;.

==Classical usages==
The Chinese classics frequently mention &quot;yinglong&quot; &quot;a winged rain-dragon&quot; in myths about the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, especially the Yellow Emperor and his alleged descendant King Yu. The examples below, limited to books with English translations, are roughly arranged in chronological order, although some heterogeneous texts have uncertain dates of composition.

===&quot;Chuci&quot;===

The (3rd–2nd centuries BCE) &quot;Chu Ci&quot; &quot;Songs of Chu&quot; mentions Yinglong helping King Yu , the legendary founder of the Xia dynasty, to control the mythic Great Deluge. According to Chinese mythology, Emperor Yao assigned Yu&#x27;s father Gun , who was supposedly a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, to control massive flooding, but he failed. Yao&#x27;s successor, Emperor Shun , had Gun executed and his body exposed, but when Gun&#x27;s corpse did not decompose, it was cut open and Yu was born by parthenogenesis. Shun appointed Yu to control the floods, and after succeeding through diligently constructing canals, Yu divided ancient China into the Nine Provinces.

The &quot;Heavenly Questions&quot; section (3, ) asks about Yinglong, in context with Zhulong &quot;Torch Dragon&quot;. &quot;Tianwen&quot;, which Hawkes characterizes as &quot;a shamanistic catechism consisting of questions about cosmological, astronomical, mythological and historical matters&quot;, and &quot;is written in an archaic language to be found nowhere else in the Chu anthology&quot; excepting &quot;one or two short passages&quot; in the &quot;Li Sao&quot; section.

The (early second century CE) &quot;Chuci&quot; commentary of Wang Yi answers that Yinglong drew lines on the ground to show Yu where to dig drainage and irrigation canals.

===&quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;===
The (c. 4th century BCE – 1st century CE) &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; records variant Yinglong myths in two chapters of &quot;The Classic of the Great Wilderness&quot; section. The &quot;Responding Dragon&quot; is connected with two deities who rebelled against the Yellow Emperor: the war-god and rain-god Chiyou &quot;Jest Much&quot; and the giant Kua Fu &quot;Boast Father&quot;.

&quot;The Classic of the Great Wilderness: The East&quot; (14, ) mentions Yinglong killing both Chiyou &quot;Jest Much&quot; and Kua Fu &quot;Boast Father&quot;, and describes using Yinglong images in sympathetic magic for rainmaking. 

Guo Pu&#x27;s (early 4th century CE) commentary mentions &quot;tulong&quot; &quot;earth/clay dragon&quot;, &quot;The earthen dragons of the present day find their origin in this.&quot;

&quot;The Classic of the Great Wilderness: The North&quot; (17, ) mentions &quot;Yinglong&quot; in two myths about killing Kua Fu &quot;Boast Father&quot;. The first version says Yinglong killed him in punishment for drinking rivers and creating droughts while chasing the sun.

The second mythic version says the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s daughter Ba &quot;Droughtghoul&quot; killed Chiyou &quot;Jest Much&quot; after Yinglong failed. Ba is a drought-demon analogous with Kua Fu.

Based on textual history of Yinglong, Chiyou, Kua Fu, and related legends, Bernhard Karlgren concludes that &quot;all these nature myths are purely Han-time lore, and there is no trace of them in pre-Han sources&quot;, with two exceptions. Ba, who is &quot;a very old folk-lore figure&quot;, already occurs in the c. Spring and Autumn period &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, and Yinglong, &quot;who directed the flow of rivers and seas&quot;, occurs in the c. Warring States period &quot;Tianwen&quot;.

===&quot;Huainanzi&quot;===
The (2nd century BCE) &quot;Huainanzi&quot; uses Yinglong in three chapters. &quot;Ying&quot; also occurs in &quot;ganying&quot; (lit. &quot;sensation and response&quot;) &quot;resonance; reaction; interaction; influence; induction&quot;, which Charles Le Blanc posits as the &quot;Huannanzi&quot; text&#x27;s central and pivotal idea.

&quot;Forms of Earth&quot; (4, ) explains how animal evolution originated through dragons, with Yinglong as the progenitor of quadrupeds. Carr notes this Responsive Dragon is usually pictured with four wings, perhaps paralleling four legs.
All creatures, winged, hairy, scaly and mailed, find their origin in the dragon. The &quot;yu-kia&quot; () produced the flying dragon, the flying dragon gave birth to the phoenixes, and after them the &quot;luan-niao&quot; () and all birds, in general the winged beings, were born successively. The &quot;mao-tuh&quot; (, &quot;hairy calf&quot;) produced the &quot;ying-lung&quot; (), the &quot;ying-lung&quot; gave birth to the &quot;kien-ma&quot; (), and afterwards the &quot;k&#x27;i-lin&quot; () and all quadrupeds, in general the hairy beings, were born successively. … 
Wolfram Eberhard suggests this &quot;otherwise unknown&quot; &quot;maodu&quot; &quot;hairy calf&quot; alludes to the &quot;water buffalo&quot;.

&quot;Peering into the Obscure&quot; (6, ) describes Fuxi and Nüwa being transported by &quot;yinglong&quot; and &quot;qingqiu&quot; &quot;green qiu-dragons&quot;, while accompanied by &quot;baichi&quot; &quot;white chi-dragons&quot; and &quot;benshe&quot; &quot;speeding snakes&quot;. 
They rode the thunder chariot, using winged dragons as the inner pair and green dragons as the outer pair. They clasped the magic jade tablets and displayed their charts. Yellow clouds hung inter-woven (to form a coverlet over the chariot) and they (the whole retinue) were preceded by white serpents and followed by speeding snakes.
Gao Yu&#x27;s (2nd century CE) &quot;Huainanzi&quot; commentary glosses &quot;yinglong&quot; as a &quot;winged dragon&quot; and &quot;qiu&quot; as a &quot;hornless dragon&quot;.

&quot;The Art of Rulership&quot; (9, ) parallels the &quot;yinglong&quot; with the &quot;tengshe&quot; &quot;soaring snake&quot; dragon. &quot;The &quot;t&#x27;eng&quot; snake springs up into the mist; the flying &quot;ying&quot; dragon ascends into the sky mounting the clouds; a monkey is nimble in the trees and a fish is agile in the water.&quot; Ames compares the &quot;Hanfeizi&quot; attribution of this &quot;yinglong&quot; and &quot;tengshe&quot; metaphor to the Legalist philosopher Shen Dao.
Shen Tzu said: &quot;The flying dragon mounts the clouds and the &quot;t&#x27;eng&quot; snake wanders in the mists. But when the clouds dissipate and the mists clear, the dragon and the snake become the same as the earthworm and the large-winged black ant because they have lost that on which they ride.

===Other texts===
&quot;Yinglong&quot; occurs in various additional Chinese texts. For instance, the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, &quot;Book of Han&quot;, and &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; histories.

The early third century CE &quot;Guangya&quot; dictionary defines &quot;yinglong&quot; &quot;winged dragon&quot; as one of the principal dragons. &quot;If a dragon has scales, he is called &quot;jiaolong&quot; []; if wings, &quot;yinglong&quot; (); if a horn, &quot;qiulung&quot; (); and if he has no horn, he is called &quot;qilong&quot; ()&quot;.

The early sixth century CE &quot;Shuyiji&quot; &quot;Records of Strange Things&quot; lists &quot;yinglong&quot; as a 1000-year-old dragon. &quot;A water snake ( &quot;shui hui&quot;) after five hundred years changes into a &quot;jiao&quot; (), a &quot;jiao&quot; after a thousand years changes into a &quot;long&quot; (), a &quot;long&quot; after five hundred years changes into a &quot;jiulong&quot; (, &quot;horned dragon&quot;) and after a thousand years into a &quot;yinglong&quot; ()&quot;.

In the Book of the Later Han, Yinglong was connected as a companion to Nüba in the myth. They fought simultaneously against Chiyou&#x27;s forces. This relationship led to the mythological romance of Nüba and Yinglong in later centuries.

==Comparative mythology==

The &quot;yinglong&quot; mythically relates with other Chinese flying dragons and rain deities such as the &quot;tianlong&quot; (&quot;heavenly dragon&quot;), &quot;feilong&quot; (&quot;flying dragon&quot;), &quot;hong&quot; (&quot;rainbow dragon&quot;), and &quot;jiao&quot; (&quot;flood dragon&quot;).

===Flying dragons===
Visser mentions that texts like the Daoist &quot;Liexian Zhuan&quot; often record &quot;flying dragons or &quot;ying-lung&quot; drawing the cars of gods or holy men&quot;. Besides the &quot;Huainanzi&quot; (above) mentioning a pair of &quot;yinglong&quot; pulling the chariot of Fuxi and Nüwa, analogous examples include legends of Huangdi ascending to heaven on a dragon (&quot;Shiji&quot;) and Yu riding a carriage drawn by two flying dragons (&quot;Bowuzhi&quot;). Carr compares pairs of &quot;Yinglong&quot; with motifs on Chinese bronzes showing two symmetrical dragons intertwined like Fuxi and Nüwa.

Porter interprets the tail of the terrestrial &quot;Yinglong&quot;, which &quot;uses its tail to sketch on the land a map of channel-like formations whereby the floodwaters were allowed to drain&quot;, as the tail of the celestial dragon Scorpius, which is &quot;situated precisely where the Milky Way &quot;splits into two branches&quot;&quot;. The (4th century CE) Shiyiji retells the Yu flood-control myth in terms of the Four Symbols, namely, the Yellow Dragon or Azure Dragon and the Black Tortoise. &quot;Yü exhausted his energy creating channels, diverting the waters and establishing mountains as the yellow dragon dragged its tail in front and the black turtle carried green-black mud (used to build the channels) in back.&quot;

===Rain dragons===
Eberhard wrote that &quot;All traditions about Ying-lung are vague&quot;. Although the legendary Yinglong dragon helped Yu to control floods, &quot;Yü was frequently bothered by dragons&quot;, most notably the flood-deity Gonggong&#x27;s minister Xiangliu . Eberhard, based on Sun Jiayi&#x27;s identification of Xiangliu as an eel, concludes that Yinglong was an eel as well:
Eberhard concludes that Yinglong and the mythic elements about Yu &quot;testify to the connection between Yü and the cultures of the south, which differ from Yü myths of the Ba culture&quot;. Carr cites Chen Mengjia&#x27;s hypothesis, based on studies of Shang dynasty oracle bones, that Yinglong was originally associated with the &quot;niqiu&quot; &quot;loach&quot;.

Yinglong representations were anciently used in rain-magic ceremonies, where Eberhard says &quot;the most important animal is always a dragon made of clay&quot;. Besides controlling rain and drought, the Yinglong Responsive Dragon did something else: &quot;With his tail he drew lines in the earth and thus created the rivers … In other words, the dragon made the waterways – the most important thing for all cultivators of rice.

<text>Preda V. Mihăilescu (born 23 May 1955) is a Romanian mathematician, best known for his proof of the 158-year-old Catalan&#x27;s conjecture.

==Biography==
Born in Bucharest, he is the brother of Vintilă Mihăilescu.

After leaving Romania in 1973, he settled in Switzerland. He studied mathematics and computer science in Zürich, receiving a PhD from ETH Zürich in 1997. His PhD thesis, titled &quot;Cyclotomy of rings and primality testing&quot;, was written under the direction of Erwin Engeler and Hendrik Lenstra.

For several years, he did research at the University of Paderborn, Germany. Since 2005, he has held a professorship at the University of Göttingen.

==Major research==
In 2002, Mihăilescu proved Catalan&#x27;s conjecture. This number-theoretical conjecture, formulated by the French and Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan in 1844, had stood unresolved for 158 years. Mihăilescu&#x27;s proof appeared in &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot; in 2004.

<doc id="639557" wikidata="Q796427" url="?curid=639557" title="BMW 6 Series">
<text>The BMW 6 Series is a range of grand tourers produced by BMW since 1976. It is the successor to the E9 Coupé and is currently in its fourth generation.

The first generation BMW E24 6 Series was available solely as a two-door coupé and produced from 1976 to 1989, when it was supplanted by the larger BMW 8 Series (E31). When the 6 Series nameplate was revived in 2004 for the second generation, the BMW E63/E64 6 Series, the coupé was joined by a convertible body style. The third generation F06/F12/F13 6 Series debuted in 2011 as a coupé and convertible, and a sedan variant known as the &quot;Gran Coupé&quot; in 2012. When the F06/F12/F13 6 Series ended production, the &quot;Gran Coupé&quot;/coupé/convertible models have been shifted into the more upmarket BMW 8 Series (G15) nameplate. The fourth generation 6 Series, the G32 6 Series, debuted in mid-2017 and is offered only as a fastback body style to complement the BMW 5 Series (G30) sedan/wagon.

The first generation 6 Series was derived from the BMW E23 7 Series, and was powered by a range of naturally aspirated inline-six gasoline engines. Following generations have been powered by inline-four, V8, and V10 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 2008, diesel engines have been included in the 6 Series range, with four-wheel drive models on offer since 2012.

A BMW M6 high performance model was produced for the first three generations of the 6 Series.

== First generation (E24; 1976–1989) ==


The BMW E24 is the first generation of 6 Series and was produced from 1976 to 1989. It replaced the E9 coupés and was solely produced in the 2-door coupé body style. Aside from the M635CSi/M6 models, the E24 was powered by a range of M30 straight-6 engines.

The E24 M635CSi (called the M6 in North America and Japan) is considered the start of the M6 model line. In most markets, the M635CSi is powered by the M88 straight-6 engine. In North America and Japan, the M6 is powered by the less powerful S38 straight-6 engine.

== Second generation (E63/E64; 2003–2010) ==

The E63/E64 is the second generation of 6 Series and was sold from 2003 to 2010. The body styles of the range are the coupé (E63 model code) and convertible (E64 model code).

In January 2003, the E63 coupé re-introduced the 6 Series range, 14 years after the E24 6 Series ended production. A few months later, the E64 convertible was released.

The E63/E64 uses a shortened version of the E60 5 Series chassis and shares many features with the 5 Series. The car initially drew criticism, due to its controversial styling and complicated iDrive system.

The M6 model was released in 2005 in coupé and convertible body styles. It is powered by the S85 V10 engine and most cars were sold with a 7-speed automated manual transmission (&quot;SMG III&quot;). Customers who wanted a fast four-door M6 Gran Coupe had to wait until November 2013 to get an M6 Gran Coupé, whereas the F12 convertible and F13 coupé M6 models were unveiled in May 2013 for the F12 M6 convertible, and July 2013 for the F13 M6 Coupé. An Alpina version of the four-door Gran Coupé was unveiled prior to the announcement of the M6 Gran Coupé at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show, and has been in production since 2011.

== Third generation (F06/F12/F13; 2011–2018) ==

The BMW F06/F12/F13 is the third generation 6 Series and was sold from 2011 to 2018. The body styles of the range are a 4-door sedan (F06 model code, marketed as &quot;Gran Coupé&quot;), 2-door convertible (F12 model code) and 2-door coupé (F13 model code).

It was introduced at the 2011 Shanghai Auto Show and New York Auto Show. A new four-door coupé version of the 6 Series was introduced in 2012, at the Geneva Motor Show; and is based on the 2007 CS Concept. Initial models included a 3.0-litre inline six engine, a 4.4-litre V8, and a 3.0-litre inline six diesel engine, with all-wheel drive variants later added to the lineup.

In 2015, the 6 Series underwent a facelift, featuring design changes and minor performance and fuel economy improvements. In February 2017, it was confirmed that the 6 Series coupé model had ended production. The convertible ended in February 2018, and the Gran Coupé ended in October 2018. Although production ended in the Autumn of 2018, the F06 Gran Coupe are available in the 2019 model year.

The F06/F12/F13 M6 is powered by the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. It is the first M6 to use a turbocharged engine.

== Third generation (G32; 2017–2023) ==

The BMW G32 is the fourth generation 6 Series, which went on sale in 2017. The body style of the G32 is a 5-door fastback and it is marketed as &quot;6 Series Gran Turismo&quot; (replacing the previous generation 5 Series Gran Turismo).

The G32 was first introduced online on 14 June 2017 and launched at the 2017 Frankfurt Auto Show in September. The range of engines consist of turbocharged 4-cylinder petrol, 6-cylinder petrol and 6-cylinder diesel engines. Most models are rear-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive (called &quot;xDrive&quot; by BMW) available as an option for some models.

<text>Pall Mall is a street in the St James&#x27;s area of the City of Westminster, Central London. It connects St James&#x27;s Street to Trafalgar Square and is a section of the regional A4 road. The street&#x27;s name is derived from pall-mall, a ball game played there during the 17th century, which in turn is derived from the Italian &quot;pallamaglio&quot;, literally &quot;ball-mallet&quot;.

The area was built up during the reign of Charles II with fashionable London residences. It is known for high-class shopping in the 18th century until the present, and gentlemen&#x27;s clubs in the 19th. The Reform, Athenaeum and Travellers Clubs have survived to the 21st century. The War Office was based on Pall Mall during the second half of the 19th century, and the Royal Automobile Club&#x27;s headquarters have been on the street since 1908.

==Geography==
The street is around long and runs east in the St James&#x27;s area, from St James&#x27;s Street across Waterloo Place, to the Haymarket and continues as Pall Mall East towards Trafalgar Square. The street numbers run consecutively from north-side east to west and then continue on the south-side west to east. It is nominally part of the A4, a major road running west from Central London, but is not used as a through road.

==History and topography==

===Early history and pall-mall field===
Pall Mall was constructed in 1661, replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket (approximately where Warwick House Street is now) to the royal residence, St James&#x27;s Palace. Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times, although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century in connection with a leper colony at St James&#x27;s Hospital. When St. James&#x27;s Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century, the park&#x27;s boundary wall was built along the south side of the road. In 1620, the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality.

Pall-mall, a ball game similar to croquet, was introduced to England in the early 17th century by James I. The game, already popular in France and Scotland, was enjoyed by James&#x27; sons Henry and Charles. In 1630, St James&#x27;s Field, London&#x27;s first pall-mall court, was laid out to the north of the Haymarket – St James road.

After the Restoration and King Charles II&#x27;s return to London on 29 May 1660, another pall-mall court was constructed in St James&#x27;s Park just south of the wall, on the site of The Mall. Samuel Pepys&#x27;s diary entry for 2 April 1661 records: &quot;[I] went into St. James&#x27;s Park, where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele, the first time that I ever saw the sport&quot;. This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway. In July 1661 posts and rails were erected, stopping up the old road. The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow, and often known as an alley, so the old court, namely St James&#x27;s Field, provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James&#x27;s Palace. A grant was made to Dan O&#x27;Neale, Groom of the Bedchamber, and John Denham, Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works, allocating a area of land for this purpose. The grant was endorsed &#x27;Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James&#x27;s&#x27;.

A new road was built on the site of the old pall-mall court, and opened in September 1661. It was named Catherine Street, after Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II, but was better known as Pall Mall Street or the Old Pall Mall. The pall-mall field was a popular place for recreation, and Pepys records several other visits. By July 1665 Pepys used &quot;Pell Mell&quot; to refer to the street as well as the game.

===17th- and 18th-century buildings===

In 1662, Pall Mall was one of several streets &quot;thought fitt immediately to be repaired, new paved or otherwise amended&quot; under the London and Westminster Streets Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 2). The paving commissioners appointed to oversee the work included the Earl of St Albans. The terms of the act allowed commissioners to remove any building encroaching on the highway, with compensation for those at least 30 years old. The commissioners determined that the real tennis court and adjoining house at the northeast corner of Pall Mall and St James&#x27;s Street should be demolished, and in 1664 notified Martha Barker, the owner of the Crown lease, to do so. Although Barker initially rejected £230 compensation, the court was demolished by 1679.

The street was developed extensively during 1662–1667. The Earl of St Albans had a lease from the Crown in 1662 on of land previously part of St James&#x27;s Fields. He laid out the site for the development of St James&#x27;s Square, Jermyn Street, Charles Street, St Albans Street, King Street and other streets now known as St James&#x27;s. The location was convenient for the royal palaces of Whitehall and St James and the houses on the east, north and west sides of the square were developed along with those on the north side of Pall Mall, each constructed separately as was usual for the time. Houses were not built along the square&#x27;s south side at first, or the adjoining part of Pall Mall. The Earl petitioned the King in late 1663 that the class of occupants they hoped to attract to the new district would not take houses without the prospect of eventually acquiring them outright. Despite opposition from the Lord Treasurer, the Earl of Southampton, on 1 April 1665 the King granted the Earl of St Albans the freehold of the St James&#x27;s Square site, along with all the ground on the north side of Pall Mall between St James&#x27;s Street and the east side of St James&#x27;s Square. The freehold of the north side of Pall Mall subsequently passed to other private owners.
The Crown kept the freehold of the land south of the street except for No. 79, which was granted to Nell Gwyn&#x27;s trustees in 1676 or 1677 by Charles II. The buildings constructed on the south side of Pall Mall in subsequent years were grander than those on the north owing to stricter design and building standards imposed by the crown commissioners. When the main road was relocated further north, some houses suddenly had their backs facing the main road, losing available land for gardening. In 1664, residents filed a petition to turn the old road into gardens, which was successful. The trustees of the Earl of St Albans received a sixty-year lease on most of this from April 1665 so that trustees could issue sub-leases to their tenants.

Several other portions of the old highway were leased for construction. At the east end, land was leased to Sir Philip Warwick who built Warwick House (now the location of Warwick House Street) and to Sir John Denham; this parcel of land became part of the grounds of Marlborough House. Portions leased at the west end included the land between St James&#x27;s Palace and the tennis court at the corner of St James&#x27;s Street, and a parcel of land leased to the Duchess of Cleveland that became the site of 8–12 Cleveland Row and Stornoway House. The 18th-century London bookseller Andrew Millar also lived in a townhouse designed by Robert Adam, at 34 Pall Mall.

104 Pall Mall was rebuilt in 1761–2 by John, second Earl of Egmont. Sir John Soane remodelled the house in 1793–4 for Lady Louisa Manners, Countess of Dysart who lived there until 1831. From 1831 to 1836 it was used for the storage and exhibition of the Royal picture collection. In 1836 it was acquired by the Reform Club.

===Later history===
By the 18th century, Pall Mall was well known for its shops as well as its grand houses. The shops included that of the Vulliamy family who made clocks at No. 68 between 1765 and 1854. Robert Dodsley ran a bookshop at No. 52, where he suggested the idea of a dictionary to Samuel Johnson. Writers and artists began to move to Pall Mall during this century; both Richard Cosway and Thomas Gainsborough lived at Schomberg House at Nos. 80–82.

The street was one of the first in London to be lit by gas after Frederick Albert Winsor set up experimental lighting on 4 June 1807 to celebrate King George III&#x27;s birthday. Permanent lighting was installed in 1820. The eastern end of Pall Mall was widened between 1814 and 1818; a row of houses on its north side was demolished to make way for the Royal Opera Arcade.

Pall Mall is known for the various gentlemen&#x27;s clubs built there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Travellers Club was founded in 1819 and moved to No. 49 Pall Mall in 1822. Its current premises at No. 106 were built in 1823 by Charles Barry. The Athenaeum Club took its name from the Athenaeum in Rome, a university founded by the Emperor Hadrian. The club moved to No. 107 Pall Mall in 1830 from tenements in Somerset House. Its entrance hall was designed by Decimus Burton. The Reform Club at Nos. 104–105 was founded for the British Radicals in 1836. The Army and Navy Club at Nos. 36–39 was founded in 1837. The name was suggested by the Duke of Wellington in order to accommodate Royal Navy members. Other clubs on Pall Mall include the United Service Club (now occupied by the Institute of Directors), the Oxford and Cambridge Club and the Royal Automobile Club.
Pall Mall was once the centre of London&#x27;s fine art scene; in 1824 the Royal Academy, the National Gallery and Christie&#x27;s auction house were all based on the street.

The freehold of much of the southern side of the Pall Mall is owned by the Crown Estate. In addition to St James&#x27;s Palace, Marlborough House, which was once a royal residence, is its neighbour to the east, opening off a courtyard just to the south of the street. It was built for Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough who laid the foundation stone in 1709, with building complete by 1711. The house reverted to Crown ownership in 1817; the future King George V was born here in 1865 and briefly lived in the house as Prince of Wales during the reign of his father, Edward VII. It became government-owned in 1959 and houses now the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Commonwealth Foundation. The Prince Regent&#x27;s Carlton House was built at the eastern end of Pall Mall in 1732 for Frederick, Prince of Wales and later inhabited by his widow, Princess Augusta. A ball was held at the house on 19 June 1811 to celebrate the start of the Prince&#x27;s regency, but ultimately he did not decide to stay in the house upon ascending the throne, and it was demolished. John Nash built Carlton House Terrace on its site between 1827 and 1832.
Pall Mall was the location of the War Office from 1855 to 1906, with which it became synonymous (just as Whitehall refers to the administrative centre of the UK government). The War Office was accommodated in a complex of buildings based on the ducal mansion, Cumberland House. The office subsequently moved to Whitehall.

The street contained two other architecturally important residences. Schomberg House, at Nos. 80–82 Pall Mall was built in 1698 for Meinhardt Schomberg, 3rd Duke of Schomberg and divided into three parts in 1769. The eastern section of the house was demolished in 1850, but reconstructed in the mid-1950s for office use. Buckingham House was the London residence of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos. It was rebuilt in the 1790s by Sir John Soane and sold by the Buckingham estate in 1847. The house was demolished in 1908 to make way for the Royal Automobile Club.

By 1902, 7 Pall Mall was occupied by the Electric Lighting Board. A first-floor room was hired to allow viewing of Edward VII&#x27;s coronation procession, which was cancelled after the king fell ill. This resulted in the legal case &quot;Chandler v Webster&quot;, concerned with the treatment of a frustrated contract.

No 77–78 Pall Mall was the home of the Marquess of Ailesbury from 1840. In 1892, it was inherited by the Marchioness&#x27; nephew, Viscount de Vesci who leased the building to the Office of Works. In 1902, it was granted to Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughter, Princess Helena and her husband Prince Christian as a grace and favour residence and retained as a home by their daughters, Princess Helena Victoria and Princess Marie Louise until 1947. In 1951, the property was divided: No.77 was occupied by the Oxford and Cambridge University Club, and no.78 by the Eagle Star Insurance Company.
The Institute of Directors was founded in 1903 and received a royal charter in 1906. The former branch of the Midland Bank at Nos. 69–70 Pall Mall was designed by Edwin Lutyens and constructed between 1922 and 1927. The original plan to redevelop No. 70 proved impractical so the two premises were demolished to provide a site for the current premises. The cigarette manufacturer Rothmans has its head office at No. 65 Pall Mall, in a building designed by Norman Shaw, while P&amp;O Ferries&#x27; main administrative office is at No. 79.

==Cultural references==
Giacomo Casanova lived in Pall Mall during 1761 as &quot;Chevalier de Seingalt&quot; and documented the stay in his memoirs. When the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray visited Dublin in 1845, he compared Pall Mall to O&#x27;Connell Street (then known as Upper Sackville Street). In 1870, Henry Benjamin Wheatley wrote &quot;Round about Piccadilly and Pall Mall&quot;, documenting changes in and around the street over the century. A compilation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s works, &quot;A Critic in Pall Mall : Being Extracts From Reviews And Miscellanies&quot;, was published in 1919, comprising essays he wrote for newspapers and journals from the 1870s to the 1890s.

Princess Elizabeth mentioned Pall Mall in her diary on celebrations on VE day: &quot;Out in crowd again,&quot; she wrote, &quot;Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Pall Mall, walked simply miles. Saw parents on balcony at 12.30am – ate, partied, bed 3am!&quot;

Pall Mall is part of a group of three squares on the British &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game, alongside Whitehall and Northumberland Avenue. All three streets converge at Trafalgar Square. Rising house prices across London mean a small flat on Pall Mall, which is in the lowest-priced third of properties on the board, now sells for over £1 million.

Charles Lamb, in his essay &quot;The Superannuated Man,&quot; also mentioned this place. The narrator of the essay confesses that he used to &quot;indent the gayer flags of Pall Mall.&quot; As the narrator is a superannuated man, he has ample time to spend. Among the means of spending time and enjoying his life is frequently visiting the club houses in Pall Mall, which gave him immense pleasure.

<text>Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands (born Petra Laurentien Brinkhorst, 25 May 1966) is married to Prince Constantijn and is the sister-in-law of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.

==Early life==

Petra Laurentien Brinkhorst was born in Leiden, Netherlands on 25 May 1966, the daughter of the former Dutch minister of Economic Affairs, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst and Jantien Brinkhorst-Heringa. She has an older brother, Marius. She is known by her middle name, Laurentien, a portmanteau of her parents&#x27; given names.

Princess Laurentien started primary school in Groningen. Her family then moved to The Hague, where she completed her primary education. She attended her secondary education in The Hague, of which four years at the Christelijk Gymnasium Sorghvliet and one year at the Eerste Vrijzinnige Christelijk Lyceum, and later in Kita, Tokyo at the Lycée Français International de Tokyo, where she obtained her Baccalauréat diploma in 1984. Her father was working in Japan at the time, being the Ambassador of the European Union to Japan between 1982 and 1987.

Princess Laurentien studied history at the University of Groningen, where she completed her Propaedeutics in 1986. She then studied at Queen Mary College, University of London where she received a BA degree in political science in 1989, and subsequently at the University of California, Berkeley where she obtained an MJ degree in 1991.

==Interests and activities==
In 2009, she was designated UNESCO Special Envoy on &quot;Literacy for Development&quot; in recognition of her &quot;outstanding commitment to the promotion of education and her profound dedication to the Organization&#x27;s ideals and objectives&quot;. In 2010 she was co-recipient of the Major Bosshardt Prize for her work in combating illiteracy.

She is also the current president of wildlife conservation NGO Fauna and Flora International. In 2024, she announced she had resigned from her position as chairwoman of the Equally Worthy Recovery Foundation following controversies involving its costs and Laurentien&#x27;s allegedly aggressive behavior toward civil servants.
==Marriage and children==
The engagement of Prince Constantijn and Laurentien Brinkhorst was announced on 16 December 2000. The civil marriage was conducted by Wim Deetman, the mayor of the Hague, in the Oude Raadzaal, Javastraat, the Hague, on 17 May 2001. The church wedding took place two days later on 19 May in the Grote of St Jacobskerk, with Reverend Carel ter Linden officiating.

Prince Constantijn and Princess Laurentien have three children: Eloise (born 2002), Claus-Casimir (born 2004), and Leonore (born 2006).

In 2015, Prince Constantijn, Princess Laurentien, and their children moved from Brussels, where they lived, to The Hague.

<text>Alexis Arquette (July 28, 1969 – September 11, 2016) was an American actress and transgender activist. 

Born in Los Angeles, she was the fourth of five children to Lewis Arquette, an actor and director, and Brenda Olivia &quot;Mardi&quot; (née Nowak), an actress. Coming from a family deeply entrenched in the entertainment industry, Alexis was the sibling of actors Rosanna, Richmond, Patricia, and David Arquette. Her career began in her youth, appearing aged 12 in the music video &quot;She&#x27;s a Beauty&quot; by The Tubes and making her screen debut in &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; (1986). Known for her versatility, Arquette often performed as a female impersonator under the name &quot;Eva Destruction&quot;, before publicly sharing her transition process towards gender-affirming surgery. Her filmography includes a range of roles, from starring roles in small productions like &quot;Jumpin&#x27; at the Boneyard&quot; (1992), &quot;Things I Never Told You&quot; (1996) and &quot;I Think I Do&quot; (1997) to appearances in mainstream hits like &quot;Threesome&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (both 1994), &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; (both 1998), &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; (1999) and &quot;Blended&quot; (2014).

Arquette&#x27;s personal life was marked by her vocal support for the transgender community and candor about her own transition journey, which was documented in the film &quot;Alexis Arquette: She&#x27;s My Brother&quot;. Despite facing health challenges, including contracting HIV in 1987 and later health complications, Arquette continued to be an active figure in entertainment and advocacy, until her death in 2016 aged 47.

==Early life==
Arquette was born in Los Angeles, the fourth of five children of Lewis Arquette, an actor and director, and Brenda Olivia &quot;Mardi&quot; (née Nowak), a Jewish actress, poet, theater operator, activist, acting teacher, and therapist. Lewis&#x27;s family&#x27;s surname was originally &quot;Arcouet&quot;; Lewis&#x27;s father was comedian Cliff Arquette, who went by the stage name of Charley Weaver. Arquette was distantly related to American explorer Meriwether Lewis. Actors Rosanna, Richmond, Patricia, and David Arquette are her siblings.

==Career==
In 1982, at the age of 12, Arquette&#x27;s first acting gig was as &quot;this little kid who&#x27;s on a ride with all these women and whatnot&quot; in the music video &quot;She&#x27;s a Beauty&quot; by The Tubes. In 1986, Arquette made her big screen debut in an uncredited role as Alexis, the androgynous friend and bandmate of sexually ambivalent teenager Max Whiteman (Evan Richards) in &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;.

Arquette, in the earlier years of her career, primarily performed as a female impersonator, frequently under the name &quot;Eva Destruction&quot;. Later in her career, Arquette made public that she had begun the process leading to sex reassignment surgery. To this end, Arquette had publicly declared that she considered her gender to be female.

At 19, Arquette played trans sex worker Georgette in the screen adaptation of &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;. The majority of Arquette&#x27;s film work was in low-budget or independent films. In total, Arquette starred in more than 40 movies, including &quot;I Think I Do,&quot; &quot;Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes They Come Back... Again&quot;. Arquette also starred as a crack addict opposite Tim Roth in &quot;Jumpin&#x27; at the Boneyard&quot;, as a teenage boy seeking revenge for a horrible childhood in the New Zealand-shot horror fantasy &quot;Jack Be Nimble&quot;, and as a murderous drag queen in the low budget comedy &quot;Killer Drag Queens on Dope&quot;.

Arquette also had supporting roles in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Threesome&quot; and &quot;Bride of Chucky,&quot; and she played a Boy George fanatic, George Stitzer, in the Adam Sandler–Drew Barrymore film &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, singing &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot; over and over. Her role as Georgina, a Boy George impersonator, in another Sandler–Barrymore film, &quot;Blended&quot;, was a reference to that role. In 2001, Arquette returned to New Zealand to play Roman emperor Caligula in two episodes of &quot;&quot;. That same year, Arquette guest starred in the &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One with Chandler&#x27;s Dad&quot;, in which she directly interacted with her sister-in-law, Courteney Cox. Also in the same year, she cameoed in &quot;Son of the Beach&quot;.

In September 2005, VH1 announced Arquette as one of the celebrity house-guests on the 6th season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. On January 31, 2007, Arquette was a featured celebrity client and guest judge on the première episode of Bravo&#x27;s reality show &quot;Top Design&quot;. Arquette also made a cameo appearance in the music video for Robbie Williams&#x27; song &quot;She&#x27;s Madonna&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Arquette expressed an interest in undergoing gender-transitioning medical treatment. She decided against undergoing hormone therapy and kept her choice of whether she underwent gender-affirming surgery private from the media by the time she completed her transition in 2006. Her experience was documented in the film &quot;Alexis Arquette: She&#x27;s My Brother&quot;, which debuted at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. Arquette was a vocal supporter of other transgender people, including Chaz Bono, who transitioned shortly after Arquette.

Arquette contracted HIV in 1987. In later life, Arquette suffered from ill health as a result of being HIV-positive. Amid these increasing complications, Alexis began presenting again as a man in 2013. Brother David Arquette said that Alexis was &quot;gender suspicious&quot; and alternately felt like a man or a woman at different times.

==Death==
Arquette was placed in a medically-induced coma and died on September 11, 2016 at 12:32 (00:32) AM., surrounded by close family, at the age of 47. Arquette was serenaded with David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Starman&quot;. The official cause of death was cardiac arrest caused by myocarditis stemming from HIV.

<doc id="639567" wikidata="Q457267" url="?curid=639567" title="Blue-footed booby">
<text>The blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) is a marine bird native to subtropical and tropical regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean. It is one of six species of the genus &quot;Sula&quot; – known as boobies. It is easily recognizable by its distinctive bright blue feet, which is a sexually selected trait and a product of their diet. Males display their feet in an elaborate mating ritual by lifting them up and down while strutting before the female. The female is slightly larger than the male and can measure up to long with a wingspan up to .

The natural breeding habitats of the blue-footed booby are the tropical and subtropical islands of the Pacific Ocean. It can be found from the Gulf of California south along the western coasts of Central and South America to Peru. About half of all breeding pairs nest on the Galápagos Islands. Its diet mainly consists of fish, which it obtains by diving and sometimes swimming underwater in search of its prey. It sometimes hunts alone, but usually hunts in groups.

The blue-footed booby usually lays one to three eggs at a time. The species practices asynchronous hatching, in contrast to many other species whereby incubation begins when the last egg is laid and all chicks hatch together. This results in a growth inequality and size disparity between siblings, leading to facultative siblicide in times of food scarcity. This makes the blue-footed booby an important model for studying parent–offspring conflict and sibling rivalry.

== Taxonomy ==
The blue-footed booby was described by the French naturalist Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1882 under the current binomial name &quot;Sula nebouxii&quot;. The specific epithet was chosen to honor the surgeon, naturalist, and explorer Adolphe-Simon Neboux (1806–1844). There are two recognized subspecies:

Its closest relative is the Peruvian booby. The two species likely split from each other recently due to their shared ecological and biological characteristics. A 2011 study of multiple genes calculated the two species diverged between 1.1 and 0.8 million years ago.

The name booby comes from the Spanish word &quot;bobo&quot; (&quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;foolish&quot;, or &quot;clown&quot;) because the blue-footed booby is, like other seabirds, clumsy on land. They are also regarded as foolish for their apparent fearlessness of humans.

== Description ==

The blue-footed booby is on average long and weighs , with the female being slightly larger than the male. Its wings are long, pointed, and brown in color. The neck and head of the blue-footed booby are light brown with white streaks, while the belly and underside exhibit pure white plumage. Its eyes are placed on either side of its bill and oriented towards the front, enabling excellent binocular vision. Its eyes are a distinctive yellow, with the male having more yellow in its irises than the female. Blue-footed booby chicks have black beaks and feet and are clad in a layer of soft white down. The subspecies &quot;S. n. excisa&quot; that breeds on the Galápagos Islands is larger than the nominate subspecies and has lighter plumage especially around the neck and head.

The Peruvian booby is similar in appearance, but has grey feet, whiter head and neck, and white spots on its wing coverts. The ranges of the two species overlap in the waters of northern Peru and southern Ecuador.

Since the blue-footed booby preys on fish by diving headlong into the water, its nostrils are permanently closed, and it has to breathe through the corners of its mouth. Its most notable characteristic is its blue-colored feet, which can range in color from a pale turquoise to a deep aquamarine. Males and younger birds have lighter feet than females. Its blue feet play a key role in courtship rituals and breeding, with the male visually displaying his feet to attract mates during the breeding season.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The blue-footed booby is distributed among the continental coasts of the eastern Pacific Ocean from California to the Galápagos Islands south into Peru. It is strictly a marine bird. Its only need for land is to breed and rear young, which it does along the rocky coasts of the eastern Pacific.

A booby may use and defend two or three nesting sites, which consist of bare black lava in small divots in the ground, until they develop a preference for one a few weeks before the eggs are laid. These nests are created as parts of large colonies. While nesting, the female turns to face the sun throughout the day, so the nest is surrounded by excrement.

=== Natal dispersal ===
Females start breeding when they are 1 to 6 years old, while males start breeding when they are 2 to 6 years old. Very limited natal dispersal occurs, meaning that young pairs do not move far from their original natal nests for their own first reproduction, leading to the congregation of hundreds of boobies in dense colonies. The benefit of limited dispersal is that by staying close to their parents&#x27; nesting sites, the boobies are more likely to have a high-quality nest. Since their parents had successfully raised chicks to reproductive age, their nest site must have been effective, either by providing cover from predation and parasitism, or by its suitability for taking off and landing. Bigamy has been observed in the species, and cases are known where two females and one male all share a single nest.

== Foot pigmentation ==

The blue color of the blue-footed booby&#x27;s webbed feet comes from structures of aligned collagens in the skin modified by carotenoid pigments obtained from its diet of fresh fish. The collagens are arranged in a manner that makes the skin appear blue. The underlying color is a &quot;flat, purplish blue&quot;. That color is modified by carotenoids to aquamarine in healthy birds. Carotenoids also act as antioxidants and stimulants for the blue-footed booby&#x27;s immune function, suggesting that carotenoid pigmentation is an indicator of an individual&#x27;s immunological state. Blue feet also indicate the current health condition of a booby. Boobies that were experimentally food-deprived for 48 hours experienced a decrease in foot brightness due to a reduction in the amount of lipids and lipoproteins that are used to absorb and transport carotenoids. Thus, the feet are rapid and honest indicators of a booby&#x27;s current level of nourishment. As blue feet are signals that reliably indicate the immunological and health condition of a booby, coloration is favored through sexual selection.

===Female selection===
The brightness of the feet decreases with age, so females tend to mate with younger males with brighter feet, which have higher fertility and greater ability to provide paternal care than older males. In a cross-fostering experiment, foot color reflects paternal contribution to raising chicks; chicks raised by foster fathers with brighter feet grew faster than chicks raised by foster males with duller feet. Females continuously evaluate their partners&#x27; condition based on foot color. In one experiment, males whose partners had laid a first egg in the nest had their feet dulled by makeup. The female partners laid smaller second eggs a few days later. As duller feet usually indicate a decrease in health and possibly genetic quality, it is adaptive for these females to decrease their investment in the second egg. The smaller second eggs contained less yolk concentration, which could influence embryo development, hatching success, and subsequent chick growth and survival. In addition, they contained less yolk androgens. As androgen plays an important role in chick survival, the experiment suggested female blue-footed boobies use the attractiveness and perceived genetic quality of their mates to determine how much resources they should allocate to their eggs. This supports the differential allocation theory, which predicts that parents care more for their offspring when paired with attractive mates.

===Male selection===
Males also assess their partner&#x27;s reproductive value and adjust their investment in the brood according to their partner&#x27;s condition. Females that lay larger and brighter eggs are in better condition and have greater reproductive value. Therefore, males tend to display higher attentiveness and parental care to larger eggs, since those eggs were produced by a female with apparent good genetic quality. Smaller, duller eggs garnered less paternal care. Female foot color is also observed as an indication of perceived female condition. In one experiment, the color of eggs was muted by researchers, males were willing to exercise similar care for both large eggs and small eggs if their mate had brightly colored feet, whereas males paired with dull-footed females only incubated larger eggs. Researchers also found that males did not increase their care when females exhibited both bright feet and high-quality offspring.

==Behavior and ecology==

=== Hunting and feeding ===

The blue-footed booby is a specialized fish eater, feeding on small schooling fish such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel, and flying fish. It will also take squid and offal. The blue-footed booby hunts by diving into the ocean after prey, sometimes from a great height, and can also swim underwater in pursuit of its prey. It can hunt singly, in pairs, or in larger flocks. Boobies travel in parties of about 12 to areas of water with large schools of small fish. When the lead bird sees a fish shoal in the water, it signals to the rest of the group and they all dive in unison, pointing their bodies down like arrows.

Plunge diving can be done from heights of and even up to . These birds hit the water around and can go to depths of below the water surface. Their skulls contain special air sacs that protect the brain from enormous pressure. Prey are usually eaten while the birds are still under water. Individuals prefer to eat on their own instead of with their hunting group, usually in the early morning or late afternoon. Males and females fish differently, which may contribute to why blue-foots, unlike other boobies, raise more than one young. The male is smaller and has a proportionally larger tail, which enables the male to fish in shallow areas and deep waters. The female is larger and can carry more food. Both the male and female feed the chicks through regurgitation.

=== Breeding ===
The blue-footed booby is monogamous, although it has the potential to be bigamous. It is an opportunistic breeder, with the breeding cycle occurring every 8 to 9 months. The courtship of the blue-footed booby consists of the male flaunting his blue feet and dancing to impress the female. The male begins by showing his feet, strutting in front of the female. Then, he presents nest materials and finishes the mating ritual with a final display of his feet. The dance also includes &quot;sky-pointing&quot;, which involves the male pointing his head and bill up to the sky while keeping the wings and tail raised.

==== Rearing young ====
The blue-footed booby is one of only two species of booby that raises more than one chick in a breeding cycle.

The female blue-footed booby lays two or three eggs, about four to five days apart. Both male and female take turns incubating the eggs, while the nonsitting bird keeps watch. Since the blue-footed booby does not have a brooding patch, it uses its feet to keep the eggs warm. The incubation period is 41–45 days. Usually, one or two chicks are hatched from the two or three eggs originally laid. The male and female share parental responsibilities. The male provides food for the young in the first part of their lives because of his specialized diving. The female takes over when the demand is higher. Chicks feed off the regurgitated fish in the adult&#x27;s mouth. If the parent blue-footed booby does not have enough food for all of the chicks, it will only feed the biggest chick, ensuring that at least one will survive.

Like other sexually size-dimorphic birds, female blue-footed boobies usually favor the smaller sex during times of food scarcity. Booby chicks do not show clear differences in size based on sex, but females do grow faster than males, which means they require greater parental investment. Blue-footed boobies display behavior that is described in the flexible investment hypothesis, which states that a female adjusts the allocation of resources to maximize her lifetime reproductive success. This was shown in an experiment in which females had their flight feathers trimmed, so that they had to expend more energy during flights to obtain food for their broods. Female chicks of such mothers were more strongly affected than their brothers, in that they had lower masses and shorter wing lengths.

Fledglings are more likely to become reproductive adults when one parent is old and the other young. The reason for this is unknown, but nestlings with different aged parents are least infected by ticks.

====Brood hierarchy due to asynchronous hatching====
The blue-footed booby lays one to three eggs in one nest at a time, although 80% of nests only contain two eggs. Eggs are laid five days apart. After the first egg is laid, it is immediately incubated, which results in a difference in chick hatching times. The first chick hatches four days before the other, so it receives a four-day head start in growth compared to its younger sibling. This asynchronous hatching serves many purposes. First, it spaces out the difficult time period in rearing during which newborn chicks are too feeble to accept regurgitated food. In addition, it reduces the chance that parents will suffer total brood loss to predators such as the milk snake.

Asynchronous hatching may also reduce sibling rivalry. Experimentally manipulated synchronous broods produced more aggressive chicks; chicks in asynchronous broods were less violent. This pattern of behavior arguably occurs through a clearly established brood hierarchy in asynchronously hatched siblings. Although asynchronous hatching is not vital for the formation of brood hierarchies (the experimentally synchronous broods established them, as well), it does aid in efficient brood reduction when food levels are low. Subordinate chicks in asynchronous broods die more quickly, thus relieving the parents of the burden of feeding both offspring when resources are insufficient to properly do so.

====Facultative siblicide====
Blue-footed booby chicks practice facultative siblicide, opting to cause the death of a sibling based on environmental conditions. The A-chick, which hatches first, will kill the younger B-chick if a food shortage exists. The initial size disparity between the A-chick and B-chick is retained for at least the first two months of life. During lean times, the A-chick may attack the B-chick by pecking at its younger sibling vigorously, or it may simply drag its younger sibling by the neck and oust it from the nest. Experiments in which the necks of chicks were taped to inhibit food ingestion showed that sibling aggression increased sharply when the weight of the A-chicks dropped below 20-25% of their potential. A steep increase in pecking occurred below that threshold, indicating that siblicide is, in part, triggered by the dominant chick&#x27;s weight, and not simply by the size difference between the siblings. Younger broods (those less than six weeks old) had three times the rate of pecking than older broods. This is perhaps due to the relative inability of young B-chicks to defend themselves against an A-chick attack.

The elder sibling also may harm the younger one by controlling access to the food delivered by the parents. A-chicks always receive food before B-chicks. Although subordinate chicks beg just as much as their dominant siblings, the older chicks are able to divert the parents&#x27; attention to themselves, as their large size and conspicuousness serve as more effective stimuli.

However, another experiment showed that booby chicks do not operate exclusively by the &quot;leftovers hypothesis&quot;, where younger chicks are fed only after the elder ones are completely satiated. Instead, researchers identified a certain degree of tolerance towards the younger sibling during short-term periods of food shortages. This hypothesis suggests that the elder chicks reduce food intake moderately, just enough so that the younger sibling does not starve. Although this system works during short-term food shortages, it is unsustainable during prolonged periods of dearth. In this latter case, the elder sibling usually becomes aggressive and siblicidal.

====Parental role in siblicide====
Blue-footed booby parents are passive spectators of this intrabrood conflict. They do not intervene in their offspring&#x27;s struggles, even at the point of siblicide. Booby parents even appear to facilitate the demise of the younger sibling by creating and maintaining the inequality between the two chicks. They reinforce the brood hierarchy by feeding the dominant chick more often than the subordinate one. Thus, they respond to the brood hierarchy and not to the level of begging when deciding which chick to feed, as both chicks beg in equal amounts. This level of passivity towards the very possible death of their younger offspring may be an indication that brood reduction is advantageous for the parents. The &quot;insurance egg hypothesis&quot; views the second egg and resulting chick as insurance for the parent in case the first egg does not hatch, or if food levels are higher than expected.

However, booby parents may not be as indifferent as they seem. The parental behavior described above may be masking parent-offspring conflict. Blue-footed booby parents make steep-sided nests that serve to deter the early ejection of the younger chick by the older sibling. This is in direct contrast to the masked booby, a species in which siblicide is obligate due to the ease in which older siblings can eject younger chicks from their flat nests. When blue-footed booby nests were experimentally flattened, parents restored them to their original steepness. Blue-footed booby chicks that were placed in masked booby nests were more likely to engage in siblicide, which reveals that parental care somehow affects the level of siblicide. Parents also appear to respond more frequently to chicks that are in poorer body conditions during periods of food deprivation. Egg-mass analysis shows that in clutches produced at the beginning of the breeding season, the second egg in a nest were, on average, 1.5% heavier than the first. Since heavier eggs give rise to heavier chicks that have greater fitness, this evidence indicates that parents may try to rectify any disadvantages that accompany a late hatching date by investing more into the second egg. Hormonal analysis of eggs also shows that no parental favoritism seems to exist in regards to androgen allocation. This may simply be because the species has evolved simpler ways to manipulate asymmetries and maximize parental reproductive output. What may at first appear to be parental cooperation with the elder chick may in fact mask a genetic parent-offspring conflict.

====Long-term effects of hierarchies====
A dominant-subordinate relationship always exists between chicks in a brood. Although dominant A-chicks grow faster and survive past infancy more often than subordinate B-chicks, no difference in reproductive success is seen between the two types of siblings during adulthood. In one longitudinal study, no long-term effects of dominance hierarchies were apparent; in fact, subordinate chicks were often observed producing nests of their own before their dominant siblings.

=== Communication ===
Blue-footed boobies make raucous or polysyllabic grunts or shouts and thin whistling noises. The males of the species have been known to throw up their heads and whistle at a passing, flying female. These ritual displays are also a form of communication.

Mates can recognize each other by their calls. Although calls differed between sexes, unique individual signatures were present. Both males and females can discriminate the calls of their mates from others.

=== Population decline ===
Concerns of a decline in the booby population of the Galápagos Islands prompted a research project in its cause. The project, completed in April 2014, confirmed the population decline. The blue-footed booby population appears to be having trouble breeding, thus is slowly declining. The decline is feared to be long-term, but annual data collection is needed for a firm conclusion that this is not a normal fluctuation.

Food problems may be the cause of an observed failure of the birds to even try to breed. This is related to a decline in sardines (&quot;Sardinops sagax&quot;), an important part of the boobies&#x27; diet. Earlier work on Española Island had successful breeding in blue-footed boobies that have access to sardines, in which case their diet consists essentially wholly of sardines. However, sardines have been largely absent from the Española area since 1997, as has been shown from Nazca boobies there, which also prefer sardines, but can breed using other prey. In 2012–13, roughly only half of prey items in the boobies&#x27; diet were sardines. No evidence was seen of other possible causes for the decline, such as effects of humans, introduced predators, or disease.

<doc id="639569" wikidata="Q1197566" url="?curid=639569" title="Lode Runner">
<text>Lode Runner is a 2D puzzle-platform game, developed by Doug Smith and published by Broderbund in 1983. Its gameplay mechanics are similar to &quot;Space Panic&quot; from 1980. The player controls a character who must collect all the gold pieces in a level and get to the end while being chased by a number of enemies. It is one of the first games to include a level editor.

After the original game, a number of remakes, spin-offs and sequels were published in the &quot;Lode Runner&quot; series for different computers and consoles by different developers and publishers. Tozai Games holds the copyright and trademark rights.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a stick figure who must collect all the gold in a level while avoiding guards who try to catch the player. After collecting all the gold, the player must reach the top of the screen to reach the next level. There are 150 levels in the game, which progressively challenge players&#x27; problem-solving abilities or reaction times.

Levels have a multi-story, brick platform motif, with ladders and suspended hand-to-hand bars that offer multiple ways to travel. Guards can pick up gold bars by running over them, but any individual guard may carry no more than one bar at a time. The player can dig holes into floors to temporarily trap guards and may safely walk atop any who have fallen into holes. Should a guard be carrying a bar of gold when he falls into a hole, he will drop it and the player can pick it up. Holes dug by the player fill themselves in after a short delay. A trapped guard who cannot escape a hole before it fills is consumed and immediately respawns in a random location at the top of the level. Unlike guards, the player&#x27;s character may not climb up out of a hole, and he will be killed if it fills before he can escape by other means. Floors may contain trapdoors, through which the player and guards will fall, and bedrock, through which the player cannot dig.

The player can dig a hole only to either side of his position and may not dig directly beneath his own feet. In order to dig through multiple layers of bricks, the player must create a gap whose width is at least equal to the number of layers. However, exceptions to this rule arise when the player digs from the position of standing on a ladder, or hanging from a hand-to-hand bar, which allows the player to repeatedly dig and descend one row. This kind of digging is involved in solving many of the levels.

The player starts with five lives; each level completion awards an extra life. Should a guard catch the player, one life is subtracted, and the current level restarts. The player&#x27;s character can fall from arbitrary heights without any injury but cannot jump, and players can trap themselves in pits from which the only escape is to abort the level, costing a life, and begin again.

===Enemy AI===
The guards do not always take the shortest path to the player and can move in counterintuitive ways. Sometimes, when the player and a guard are on the same ladder, for instance, the guard will move away from the player. In general, depending on their exact positioning relative to Lode Runner, the guards sometimes appear to be repelled. Mastering the game involves developing the intuition to predict the movement of the guards.

===Permitted contact===
The player may come into contact with a guard directly from above, with the stick figure&#x27;s feet touching the guard&#x27;s head. This is what enables the player to walk over guards who are temporarily stuck in a hole that has been dug. It is also possible to make this contact while both the guard and the player are in free fall, since the player not only runs faster than the guards, but also falls faster; moreover, it is possible to survive the feet-to-head contact while a guard is standing on a platform and begins to move. Both forms of contact are necessary to solve some levels. Sometimes it is necessary to liberate a trapped guard by digging while standing on his head but then moving rapidly in the opposite direction when the guard begins marching to freedom. In a few levels, it is necessary to use a falling guard as a bridge to reach an otherwise unreachable area. One subtlety is that if a down movement is initiated while standing on a guard&#x27;s head, or briefly touching the guard&#x27;s head during free fall, the consequences are fatal.

===Trapping and using guards===
In some levels, guards can be deliberately trapped in various ways. For instance, they can be lured into entering a part of the level from which there is no escape. In some situations, the player can liberate trapped guards by digging them out. In some levels, the player must exploit the guards by having them collect gold pieces which are positioned such that whoever collects them will become trapped. When the guard collects the piece and becomes trapped, the player can release the guard and then later steal the gold when the guard drops it or falls into a hole.

In some levels, there are gold pieces that can be collected only by killing guards by digging holes to trap them. Deceased guards come back to life from locations near the top of the screen, which may allow them to reach parts of the level that cannot be reached by the player.

===Traversal orders===
Some levels require careful ordering of traversal, because they are divided into zones connected by passages which are impossible to traverse in the reverse direction. If a gold piece remains in an unreachable zone, the player may have to abort the level to start again, losing a life, unless there is a way to coax a guard into bringing the gold.

===Timing===
Some of the game&#x27;s puzzles in the advanced levels are time-sensitive. The player must dig in order to penetrate the interior of some cavern to collect gold, and quickly return the same way before the digging repairs itself, enclosing Lode Runner in that cavern with no means of escape.

Some puzzles require deliberate timing among the digging actions because Lode Runner must run over previously dug-out tiles that have just repaired themselves, while having enough time to pass through ones which have not yet repaired.

==Development==
Around late 1980, high school student James Bratsanos heard from a friend about a new arcade video game, &quot;Space Panic&quot; by Universal, which involves climbing platforms and ladders while digging holes to trap monsters. Bratsanos was intrigued by his friend&#x27;s description of the concept, and he wanted to develop it further. He began writing a Commodore PET program, called &quot;Suicide&quot;, using simple text-based graphics. Due to his lack of programming experience, there were no pre-programmed levels, but he instead built &quot;an engine that could interpret a game level and then run a processing loop on the monsters&quot;. This novel design later evolved into the concept of a level editor.

At the University of Washington in 1981, Bratsanos met two other students, architecture student Douglas E. Smith and Tracy Steinbeck. Following the release of Nintendo&#x27;s arcade platformer &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; that year, the three students began working on a program called &quot;Kong&quot;, which evolved the concepts of &quot;Suicide&quot;. Bratsanos later left the project to pursue his studies, and Smith continued to develop &quot;Kong&quot; into the prototype of what later became &quot;Lode Runner&quot;. &quot;Kong&quot; was written for a Prime Computer 550 minicomputer limited to one building on the UW campus. &quot;Kong&quot; was soon ported to VAX minicomputers, which had more terminals available on campus. The game was programmed in Fortran using ASCII character graphics. When &quot;Kong&quot; was ported to the VAX, some Pascal sections were mixed into the original Fortran code.

Over one weekend in 1982, Smith recreated a crude, playable version in 6502 assembly language on an Apple II Plus and renamed the game &quot;Miner&quot;. Through the end of the year, he refined that version, which was black-and-white with no joystick support. He submitted a rough version to Broderbund around October 1982 and received a one-line rejection letter in response to the effect of &quot;Thank you for submitting your game concept. Unfortunately, it does not fit within our product line.&quot;

&quot;Miner&quot;, like its text-based &quot;Kong&quot; predecessors, had only simple animation where characters move across the screen in block increments. It was too primitive for an acceptable commercial product as Broderbund wanted detailed pixel-level movement. Smith&#x27;s new game would be one of the first to include a level editor for user generated content, allowing players to create levels for the game. Smith was given a $10,000 advance by Broderbund to develop the inter-square animation and to provide 150 levels of play. In a 2010 interview, game designer John Romero claimed that Smith added the level-editing function at the request of neighborhood kids he had testing the game, and &quot;a ton&quot; of the levels they designed ended up in the final game. Smith borrowed money to purchase a color monitor and joystick and continued to improve the game. Around Christmas of 1982, he submitted the game, renamed &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, to four publishers and received offers from all four: Sierra, Sirius, Synergistic, and Broderbund. He took the deal with Broderbund.

==Release and ports==
&quot;Lode Runner&quot; was originally released on June 23, 1983. The original microcomputer versions were for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, VIC-20, Commodore 64, and IBM PC compatibles. The VIC-20 version was released on cartridge, including the level editor. The Commodore 64 had both a disk and cartridge release, with the latter having 32 levels. The IBM PC port was originally on a self-booting disk and is incompatible with video cards other than CGA. A 1986 MS-DOS release runs on any video card.

The Famicom version was released by Hudson Soft in 1984 (North American NES release in 1986) and became one of the earliest third-party games made for that system. It has 50 levels, scrolling screens, added music, and graphics redone in a more cartoon-like style. In addition, fruits and vegetables randomly appear which may be grabbed for additional points. A level editor was included, which in Japan used the Famicom&#x27;s Family BASIC tape drive to save one&#x27;s work; however, as with many US localisations, the NES lacked the tape drive and thus there is no way to save levels created with the US release.

An arcade version of &quot;Lode Runner&quot; was produced by Irem in 1984. It was notably the first time an American computer game was adapted into a Japanese arcade game. It had some added features like the ability to hang off the ends of ladders and an improved enemy AI.

A port for the Macintosh 128K followed in January 1985; it runs on machines up to OS 6 and can be used on System 7 with a patch. Other versions include those for the Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, a licensed version for MSX published by ASCII Corporation, SG-1000, Windows 3.1x, and Game Boy.

Broderbund released an enhanced version, &quot;Championship Lode Runner&quot;, in 1985, with 50 levels and a higher difficulty. The company offered a commemorative certificate to anyone who could submit proof of having beaten the game (and submitted proof of purchase to show that their copy of the game was not pirated). It was ported to the Apple, Atari, C64, MSX, and IBM PC, as well as the NES (although that version did not reach North America).

The Atari 8-bit version of &quot;Lode Runner&quot; was converted to cartridge and re-released by Atari Corporation in 1987, as one of the series of releases for the Atari XEGS console. This version contains all 150 levels and the level editor, which requires a disk drive.

==Reception==
&quot;Lode Runner&quot; was very successful. It was Broderbund&#x27;s second best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987, and sales had surpassed 300,000 copies by August 1984. It was the top-selling computer game in the United States during 1983. By 1985, the game had sold just as many copies in Japan. , Hudson Soft&#x27;s Famicom (NES) version had sold about 1.5 million cartridges in Japan and all versions of the game had sold over 3 million units worldwide, including more than 2 million sales in Japan alone.

&quot;Softline&quot; in 1983 praised &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, calling it &quot;smooth, thoughtful, and quite addictive&quot;. The magazine approved of its large number of unique levels, level editor (&quot;the possibilities are astounding&quot;), and emphasis on &quot;wits and strategy&quot; over violence. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised &quot;Lode Runner&quot;″s unusually easy-to-use level editor and the strategy necessary for an arcade title, describing it as &quot;one of the few thinking men&#x27;s arcade games&quot;. In August 1984, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; held a contest for the best reader-built level. Praises for the introduction of strategy into the &quot;climbing game&quot; genre and for the intuitive level editor were repeated in &quot;Video&quot; magazine&#x27;s review of the game as well as praise for its graphics and animation, with the Apple II version being described as &quot;stand[ing] out far ahead of the pack&quot;.

&quot;Ahoy!&quot; in 1984 called the game &quot;a top-notch action game that requires both a quick mind and an agile joystick&quot;. With the &quot;easy-to-use game generator&quot;, the magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;Lode Runner&quot; is one of the best games available for the C-64. Unconditionally and wholeheartedly recommended&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; gave the game 16.25 out of 18 points. The magazine called the game &quot;a tour de force of American ingenuity ... the first release in a long, long time that can honestly bear the title, &#x27;computer game&#x27; ... &quot;Lode Runner&quot; uses the power of the PC to create something much more than a video version of Ping Pong. This game requires thought, too.&quot; The magazine praised the IBM PC version&#x27;s graphics, increasingly difficult level design, and the level editor. &quot;The Commodore 64 Home Companion&quot; said that &quot;there&#x27;s lots of education hidden in&quot; the level editor, concluding that &quot;Lode Runner&quot; &quot;is one of the first of a new breed of computer game that lets the player be a creator&quot;.

By 1985, the game was still selling well, with &quot;Video&quot; magazine reporting that it was the 6th best-selling recreational title in March and April of that year. &quot;Zzap!64&quot; called the Commodore 64 version &quot;not one of the most recent games but certainly one of the best ... a classic for a long time to come ... graphically minuscule and aurally crude, the game&#x27;s sheer addiction kept my eyes propped open until the owls went to bed&quot;. In 1986 &quot;Ahoy!&quot; described the Commodore 64 version&#x27;s graphics as &quot;sparse, but attractive&quot; with &quot;evocatively animated&quot; characters.

In 1984, &quot;Lode Runner&quot; was awarded &quot;1984 Computer Game of the Year&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. Judges praised its &quot;outstanding design&quot;, and described it as &quot;fascinating&quot;, &quot;irresistible&quot;, and as &quot;the thinking player&#x27;s climbing conquest&quot;. &quot;Softline&quot; readers named &quot;Lode Runner&quot; the most popular Apple and fourth most-popular Atari program of 1983. In 1993 the Spectrum version of the game was voted number 37 in the &quot;Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. GameSpot named &quot;Lode Runner&quot; as one of the &quot;Greatest Games of All Time&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Lode Runner&quot; the 80th-best computer game ever released. &quot;Time&quot; in 2010 rated &quot;Lode Runner&quot; #1 game in &quot;The 10 Greatest Games for the Apple II&quot; list. &quot;Game Informer&quot; placed the game 52nd on their top 100 video games of all time in 2001.

Orson Scott Card wrote in &quot;Compute!&quot; in 1989 that its editor was the first game that let him and his family express their creativity through gaming. &quot;Tetris&quot; designer Alexey Pajitnov stated in 2008 that &quot;Lode Runner&quot; was his favorite puzzle game for many years.

===Arcade===
In 1984, Irem developed an arcade conversion of &quot;Lode Runner&quot;. It contains 24 remixed levels from the 150 original levels. Irem brought many of its arcade-inspired levels to the Famicom Disk System with the names &quot;Super Lode Runner&quot; and &quot;Super Lode Runner II&quot;. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Lode Runner&quot; on their August 1, 1984 issue as being the most successful table arcade cabinet of the month. The arcade version has numerous sequels, including these:

* &quot;Lode Runner: The Bungeling Strikes Back&quot; (1984), selecting 30 levels based on the original game developed for the arcade. The gameplay is almost exactly the same (save the addition of a two-player mode) and the only heavy modification was the graphics and advancement to a 512-color palette. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Lode Runner: The Bungeling Strikes Back&quot; on their March 1, 1985 issue as the seventh most successful table arcade unit of the month.
* &quot;Lode Runner: Majin No Fukkatsu&quot; (1985), also known as &quot;Lode Runner: The Golden Labyrinth&quot;, developed by Irem. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their December 15, 1985 issue as the top-grossing table arcade unit during that month. It went on to be Japan&#x27;s ninth highest-grossing table arcade game during the first half of 1986.
* &quot;Lode Runner: Teikoku Karano Dasshutsu&quot; (1986)
* &quot;Lode Runner: The Dig Fight&quot; (2000)

===1990s===
* &quot;Lode Runner: The Lost Labyrinth&quot;, 1990 updated version for the TurboGrafx-16 featuring all 150 levels of the 1983 set.
* &quot;Lode Runner: The Legend Returns&quot;, a 1994 Sierra incarnation of the original game with enhanced graphics and tools.
* &quot;Lode Runner Online: The Mad Monks&#x27; Revenge&quot;, the 1995 remake which replaced all the elements of the previous plus new online play.
* &quot;Lode Runner 2&quot; (1998), a game with isometric 3D gameplay.
* &quot;Lode Runner&quot; (1998), a compilation game for PlayStation, which includes &quot;Lode Runner: The Legend Returns&quot; and &quot;Lode Runner Extra&quot;.
* &quot;Lode Runner 3-D&quot; (1999) for the Nintendo 64.

Several versions of &quot;Lode Runner&quot; were not released in the U.S., such as &quot;Lode Runner Twin&quot; and &quot;Power Lode Runner&quot; (1999, SFC), which vary gameplay, mostly by adding different characters and scenarios. Another title, &quot;Battle Lode Runner&quot;, was originally exclusive to Japan, but made available on 23 April 2007 as the first Japan-only game to appear on Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console service. The original &quot;Lode Runner&quot; followed in June 2007. There is also a &quot;Cubic Lode Runner&quot;, a 3-D &quot;Lode Runner&quot; variant released only in Japan for the GameCube and PlayStation 2.

The NES version, developed by Hudson Soft, marked the first appearance of Bombermen as the opposing robots. The end screen to &quot;Bomberman&quot; for the NES notes that the original White Bomberman has turned human and hints at his appearance in another game, with the Lode Runner behind him. In the Japanese version, the reference is more direct: &quot;Congratulations - Bomber Man becomes Runner - See you again in Lode Runner&quot;.

In Japan, the Famicom version of &quot;Lode Runner&quot; allows editing and creating levels to share with friends using a Famicom Data Recorder.

Hudson Soft released a version of &quot;Lode Runner&quot; for Nintendo DS in 2006.

An unreleased version of the game for the Atari Lynx was discovered in 2008 on an old Atari Corp. hard drive.

===2000s===
A remake of &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, developed by Tozai and Southend Interactive, was released on April 22, 2009. The game features revamped 3D graphics, additional game modes, cooperative and competitive multiplayer support, six new block types and a level editor, as well as live leaderboards and a timeline of the game&#x27;s history.

===2010s===
&quot;Lode Runner Classic&quot; was made available as an Xbox Live enhanced game for Windows Phone 7 series of phones on July 18, 2012. It features the graphics, gameplay, and 150 levels from the original &quot;Lode Runner&quot; game. &quot;Lode Runner Classic&quot; was released for iOS and Android phones on January 17, 2013.

&quot;Lode Runner 1&quot; is a remake of the original NES game, and has the same mechanic, in brand new 2D graphics. It is different to the other same-year release in the series, &quot;Lode Runner Legacy&quot;. It was released for free on Android, iPhone and iPad on May 18, 2017.

===2020s===
A new &quot;Lode Runner&quot; game was announced for the Intellivision Amico. It is being made in partnership between Intellivision Entertainment and Tozai Games.

Dion Olsthoorn licensed the original &quot;Lode Runner&quot; from Tozai to create a version for the Atari 2600. The ZeroPage Homebrew channel featured the gameplay and an interview with the programmer on their Twitch Livestream on October 8, 2022.

The park preserves Fort Jefferson and the several Dry Tortugas islands, the westernmost and most isolated of the Florida Keys. The archipelago&#x27;s coral reefs are the least disturbed of the Florida Keys reefs.

The park is noted for abundant sea life, tropical bird breeding grounds, colorful coral reefs, and shipwrecks and sunken treasures. The park&#x27;s centerpiece is Fort Jefferson, a massive but unfinished coastal fortress. Fort Jefferson is the largest brick masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere, composed of more than 16 million bricks. Dry Tortugas is unique in its combination of a largely undisturbed tropical ecosystem with significant historic artifacts. The park is accessible only by seaplane or boat and has averaged about 63,000 visitors annually in the period from 2008 to 2017. Activities include snorkeling, picnicking, birdwatching, camping, scuba diving, saltwater fishing and kayaking. Overnight camping is limited to eight primitive campsites at the Garden Key campground, located just south of Fort Jefferson.

Dry Tortugas National Park is part of the Everglades &amp; Dry Tortugas Biosphere Reserve, established by UNESCO in 1976 under its Man and the Biosphere Programme.

==Geography==
The Dry Tortugas are a small archipelago of coral islands about west of Key West, Florida. They represent the westernmost extent of the Florida Keys, though several reefs and submarine banks continue westward outside the park, beyond the Tortugas.

The park area is more than 99 percent water. The northern and western portions of the park, including the central island group, were designated a research natural area in 2007, in which no marine life may be taken, nor may vessels anchor. Vessels wishing to moor in this area must use designated mooring buoys or docks. About 54 percent of the park remains open for fishing. The park is bordered on the east, south and west by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and on the northwest by the Tortugas Ecological Reserve.

The keys are low and irregular. Some have thin growths of mangroves, and various other vegetation, while the smallest have only small patches of grass, or no plant life. There are nominally seven islands, but there have been up to eleven during the past two centuries. The islands are continually changing in size and shape, and the number of distinct landmasses varies, as changing water levels expose and cover the lower islands and sandy land bridges between some of the islands. Some of the smaller islands have disappeared and reappeared multiple times as a result of hurricane impact. The major islands within the park are, roughly from west to east, Loggerhead Key, Garden Key, Bush Key, Long Key, Hospital Key, Middle Key, and East Key. The total land area within the park varies with water level. The total land area is about .

* Loggerhead Key, in size, with an area of is the largest. This island has the highest elevation in the Dry Tortugas, at . The Dry Tortugas lighthouse, high, is on this island.
* Garden Key, with Fort Jefferson and the inactive Garden Key lighthouse (). It is east of Loggerhead Key. Garden Key is the second largest island in the chain, at in size, with an area of . The original size, before construction of Fort Jefferson, has been estimated at .
* Bush Key, formerly named Hog Island because of the hogs that were raised there to provide fresh meat for the prisoners at Fort Jefferson, just a few meters east of Garden Key. At times, Bush Key is connected to Garden Key by a sand bar. The island is the third largest, , area , less than high. Bush Key is the site of a large tern rookery. It is closed to visitors from February to September to protect nesting sooty terns and brown noddys.
* Long Key, south of the eastern end of Bush Key, in size, area of . At times it is connected to Bush Key by a sandbar.
* Hospital Key, so called because a hospital for the inmates of Fort Jefferson had been built there in the 1870s. The island was formerly called Middle Key or Sand Key. It lies northeast of Garden Key and Bush Key, . Its area is , and it is above sea level at its highest point.
* Middle Key, east of Hospital key, , area . Due to various seasonal changes, storm patterns and tidal cycles it is not always above sea level, disappearing for weeks or months, only to reappear again.
* East Key, east of Middle Key, , area , over high.

The three westernmost keys, which are also the three largest keys (Loggerhead Key, Garden Key, and Bush Key), make up about 93 percent of the total land area of the group.

=== Former islands ===
Formerly existing keys were (from west to east):
* Southwest Key, disappeared by 1875, today a shoal south off of Loggerhead Reef.
* Bird Key (formerly Booby Key), was about southwest of Garden Key, disappeared in 1935. Current names in the area are &quot;Bird Key Bank&quot; and &quot;Bird Key Harbor&quot;. The Key was the site of numerous Union soldiers&#x27; graves during the Civil War.
* North Key, probably identical with former &quot;Booby Island&quot;, current name in the area is &quot;North Key Harbor&quot;, an anchorage WSW of Pulaski Shoal, disappeared by 1875.
* Northeast Key (earlier called Sand Key), was between East Key and North Key, slightly to the North, disappeared by 1875.

=== Shoals with lights ===
* Pulaski Shoal (Pulaski Reef), marking the northeast edge of the group at , is not an island, but the former location of the Pulaski Shoal Light.
* Iowa Rock, halfway between Garden Key and Hospital Key, is another site of a navigational light (and weather station) built in shallow water. It was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo, with three bare stumps left.

==Geology==
The Dry Tortugas are the western extension of an arcuate chain of Pleistocene reef and oolitic limestone islands, with the eastern limit in the vicinity of Miami. These Florida Keys are the surface expression of the thick southern Florida carbonate platform, which has been accumulating sediments since the Early Cretaceous. Two stratigraphic units are exposed at the surface, the Key Largo Limestone and the Miami Limestone. The Key Largo Limestone are reefs up to 200 ft (61 m) thick, parallel to the shelf edge, consisting of hermatypic corals and calcarenites. The Miami Limestone is less than 49 ft (15 m) thick, and in general is found behind the Key Largo Limestone reef, but overlies it in the western extent of the keys. It consists of a bryozoan facies and an oolitic facies and represents a subtidal shoal. Additionally, excellent examples of Holocene carbonate-sand deposits are found in the Dry Tortugas, consisting mainly of disarticulated &quot;Halimeda&quot; plates. Between the Dry Tortugas and Key West is a 39 ft (12 m) thick example of these sand deposits, known as &quot;the quicksands&quot;.

==Climate==
Dry Tortugas has a tropical savanna climate (Aw), with a rainy season coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season from May to October and a dry season extending from November through April. Despite occasional exposure to tropical systems, the Dry Tortugas is the driest place in Florida with an annual precipitation of about . There is no large jungle or forest canopy area on the islands, and the sandy soil (which drains quickly) and intense sun only enhance the drought-like conditions often found on the islands. Seasonally there is little temperature variation, with high temperatures in summer around and low temperatures in winter around . Like the rest of the lower keys, there has never been a recorded frost or freeze. The hardiness zone is 12a, with an annual mean minimum temperature of .
== History ==
The first European to see the Dry Tortugas was Juan Ponce de León, who visited on June 21, 1513. Ponce de León caught 160 sea turtles there and subsequently referred to the islands as the &quot;Tortugas&quot; (turtles). They are called &quot;Dry&quot; owing to the absence of surface fresh water on the island. The name is the second oldest surviving European place-name in the US.

The archipelago includes a high concentration of historically significant shipwrecks dating from the 17th century to the present. In 1742 wrecked in the Dry Tortugas. The stranded crew lived on Garden Key for 56 days, and fought a battle with a Spanish sloop, before sailing to Jamaica in several boats.

Florida was acquired from Spain by the United States in 1819. The Dry Tortugas were seen as a strategic point for the control of the Straits of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. Work on a lighthouse on Garden Key started in 1825. In 1856 work on a new, more powerful lighthouse on Loggerhead Key was started to replace the Garden Key light.

John James Audubon visited the Tortugas in 1832 and so did Louis Agassiz in 1858.

The Dry Tortugas are also rich in maritime history. In 1989 Seahawk Deep Ocean Technology explored a shipwreck believed to be part of the 1622 Spanish treasure fleet. The wreck located in of water, yielded olive jars, copper, gold, silver, glass and other cultural artifacts. On September 6, 1622, the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; was driven by a severe hurricane onto a coral reef near the Dry Tortugas, about west of Key West. Mel Fisher and his company discovered the wreck July 20, 1985. The estimated $450 million cache recovered, known as &quot;The Atocha Motherlode,&quot; included 40 tons of gold and silver; there were some 114,000 of the Spanish silver coins known as pieces of eight, gold coins, Colombian emeralds, gold and silver artifacts, and 1,000 silver .&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.melfisher.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the &quot;Atocha&quot;, Fisher&#x27;s company, Salvors Inc., found remains of several nearby shipwrecks, including the &quot;Atocha&#x27;s&quot; sister galleon the &quot;Santa Margarita&quot;, lost in the same year, and the remains of a slave ship known as the &quot;Henrietta Marie&quot;, lost in 1700.

=== Fort Jefferson ===
Fort Jefferson is a massive but unfinished coastal fortress. It is the largest masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere, and is composed of more than 16 million bricks.

Planning for a fortification began almost immediately after American acquisition, and construction started in 1847. Work was half complete in 1860. Workers consisted mostly of enslaved Black people hired from their owners in Key West and other parts of the State of Florida. Some White laborers, mostly Irish immigrants were also employed. The use of enslaved labor was discontinued in 1863. This bastion remained in Union hands throughout the Civil War. It later was used as a prison until abandoned in 1874. Dr. Samuel Mudd, famous for being the doctor who treated John Wilkes Booth in the wake of the Lincoln assassination, was imprisoned here for conspiracy with three others until early 1869, when he was pardoned in 1869 after averting a viral outbreak. Also imprisoned was a leader of the &quot;Chicago Conspiracy&quot;, Englishman George St. Leger Grenfell, who is supposed to have drowned having escaped in a small boat.

During the 1880s, the Navy established a base in the Dry Tortugas, and it subsequently set up a coaling (refueling) and a wireless (radio) station there as well. During World War I, a seaplane base was established in the islands, but it was abandoned soon thereafter.

From 1903 until 1939 the Carnegie Institution of Washington operated the Marine Biology Laboratory on Loggerhead Key which &quot;...quickly became the best-equipped marine biological station in the tropical world.&quot; Through the years, over 150 researchers used the facilities to perform a wide range of research. In June 1911 the laboratory built a vessel in Miami, , for use by researchers as well as logistics between the station and Key West. The vessel, excepting a period of World War I service with the Navy, supported the laboratory&#x27;s work until closure in 1939 and donation of &quot;Anton Dohrn&quot; to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

An account of a visit to the fort at the Dry Tortugas by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Justice-to-be Robert H. Jackson can be found in Jackson&#x27;s book &quot;That Man: An Insider&#x27;s Portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;.

=== History of African Americans on the island ===
Fort Jefferson was home to African Americans not only as enslaved persons but also as Union Soldiers, freedmen and prisoners. Starting in 1847, the United States Army Corps of Engineers hired enslaved laborers. Between 1847 and 1860, approximately 17% of Key West&#x27;s enslaved people were leased to the Corp as laborers. The majority of the enslaved people working at Fort Jefferson were men, who were the base of the hard, unskilled workers. Some were also employed as domestic servants, boatmen and cooks. Enslaved women were also present. They did the wash and some cooking. After the Emancipation Proclamation, some freed African American men enlisted in the Union Army. The 82nd Colored Infantry was stationed at Fort Jefferson near the end of the Civil War. Between 1861 and 1871, there were African Americans held as military prisoners at the fort.

== Park history ==
Comprising , Fort Jefferson National Monument was designated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt under the Antiquities Act on January 4, 1935. The monument was expanded in 1983 and redesignated as Dry Tortugas National Park on October 26, 1992, by an act of Congress. Dry Tortugas is managed together with Everglades National Park; they share a superintendent. The park was established to protect the island and marine ecosystems of the Dry Tortugas, to preserve Fort Jefferson and submerged cultural resources such as shipwrecks, and to allow for public access in a regulated manner.

During the United States federal government shutdowns of 1995–1996, Dry Tortugas was closed along with all other national parks. Seeing this as having a damaging effect on their tourism-dependent economy, the residents of Key West, Florida, raised money to keep Dry Tortugas open. The effort was inspired by the Smithsonian Institution, which raised private donations to keep its museums open during the shutdown.

Failing to find anybody to accept the money to reopen the park, Key West residents, under the auspices of the satirical micronation Conch Republic, sent a flotilla of civilian boats and fire department boats to Fort Jefferson in order to reopen the national park. When officials attempted to enter the fort, they were cited. The citation was contested in court the following year, and the resultant case, &quot;The United States of America v. Peter Anderson&quot;, was quickly dropped.

The park is a landing location for immigrants arriving from Cuba in homebuilt boats called &quot;chugs&quot;. Receiving and housing the migrants is a particular problem for Dry Tortugas, which has limited resources for such arrivals and which is several hours from the nearest Coast Guard or Border Patrol units. Communications with Key West are accomplished using a satellite-based voice-over-IP system, which is prone to garbling and delays, and by a radio relay system using an abandoned Air Force tower between Key West and the Dry Tortugas.

Visitation steadily rose for several decades, reaching a peak of 83,704 in 2000. Since then visitation has slowly declined, with an average of about 63,000 per year in the period from 2007 to 2016.

In August 2004, the Dry Tortugas were directly struck by Hurricane Charley. The following day, a Cessna airplane crashed into the water near the islands, killing cinematographer Neal Fredericks while he was filming scenery for the feature film &quot;CrossBones&quot;. In September 2022, the islands were again directly struck by Hurricane Ian.

==Ecology==

The Dry Tortugas archipelago is classified as a borderline subtropicaltropical ecosystem, hosting species that do not normally breed in, and are not commonly found anywhere else within, the continental United States or the islands and waters surrounding it.

When the cold wave of January 1977 wiped out 96 percent of shallow-water branching coral, once extensive branching coral formations became rubble fields. The Dry Tortugas National Park now consists of patch reef and branching coral rubble.

===Birds===

Dry Tortugas National Park has an official bird list of 299 species. Of these, only eight species frequently nest within the park: sooty tern, brown noddy, brown pelican, magnificent frigatebird, masked booby, roseate tern, bridled tern and mourning dove. The park features the only nesting colonies of sooty tern, brown noddy, magnificent frigatebird, and masked booby in the contiguous United States.

Birdwatching activity peaks each spring (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can pass through the park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common yellowthroat, yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation in the fall of 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.

===Invasive species and eradication efforts===
An active eradication program has resulted in the removal of invasive &quot;Casuarina&quot; trees and agave from Loggerhead Key, by cutting and herbicide treatment. Pterois, commonly known as lionfish, have also been found in the park&#x27;s waters and the National Park Service was reviewing (in 2015) the lionfish management plan to determine what actions to take to manage the spread of this invasive species in Dry Tortugas National Park and Everglades National Park.

== Visiting ==
Most visitors arrive in Dry Tortugas National Park by either boat or seaplane from Key West. Official ferry and transportation services to the Dry Tortugas include the Yankee Freedom III catamaran, private vessel chartering and seaplane services. Other methods of visiting the Dry Tortugas include chartering of authorized and approved private vessels. There are no road connections to Dry Tortugas, and cars cannot access the islands.

Inside Dry Tortugas National Park the goods and services are limited. Visitors are required to bring the food, water and supplies they might need during their time in the park. The closest restaurants and hotels are located in Key West. However, primitive camping sites are available within Dry Tortugas on Garden Key.

<text>Joseph Fielding Smith Sr. (November 13, 1838 – November 19, 1918) was an American religious leader who served as the sixth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was a nephew of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and the last LDS Church president who had personally known him.

==Biography==
Smith was the son of church patriarch Hyrum Smith and his second wife, Mary Fielding, a British convert to the church who married Hyrum after the death of his first wife, Jerusha Barden Smith (1805–1837). In addition to her two children, Mary raised the six children born to Hyrum and Jerusha.

===Early life===
Smith was born in Far West, Missouri, on November 13, 1838. Just a few days before he was born, his father had been taken prisoner under the auspices of the Missouri Executive Order 44 (infamously called the &quot;extermination order&quot; due to its threat against the lives of Mormons who refused to leave the state after clashes between them and a Missouri militia). At point of bayonet, Hyrum was marched to his home in Far West and ordered to say farewell to his wife. He was told that his &quot;doom was sealed&quot; and that he would never see her again. Hyrum was still in custody in Liberty Jail, Missouri, when Smith was born. He was named after his uncles Joseph Smith and Joseph Fielding. His mother and maternal aunt, Mercy Fielding Thompson, fled with their children to Quincy, Illinois, early in 1839, and they later moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, when the majority of the church&#x27;s members settled. Hyrum was later released from custody during a transfer from Liberty Jail and joined his family in Nauvoo. Joseph F. Smith stated as an adult that he had memories of Nauvoo, and could recall his Uncle Joseph and events that occurred at his uncle&#x27;s home; he was nearly six years old when his father and uncle were killed in Carthage, Illinois, on June 27, 1844.

===Winter Quarters===
Smith&#x27;s family remained in Nauvoo until September 1846, at which time his mother took their family and fled the city, camping on the west side of the Mississippi River among the trees on its banks, without wagon or tent, while the city was bombarded by mobs. His mother was later able to exchange their property in Illinois for a wagon and team of oxen. Smith and his family, along with many other Latter Day Saints, fled the American Midwest. The seven-year-old Smith drove the team of oxen with his family to the Latter Day Saint encampment at Winter Quarters, Nebraska.

While at Winter Quarters, Smith and another boy, Thomas Burdick, were out on horseback some distance from the settlement, watching the cattle graze. They saw a band of twenty or thirty American Indians ride into the valley on the other side of the cattle. Burdick rode back to camp to get help while Smith rode toward the Indians and got between the Indians and the herd before the Indians reached them. Smith was able to turn the herd back toward the settlement, and, coupled with the noise and arrival of the Indians, started a stampede which saved the herd from capture. He was still riding with the herd at full speed when two Indians picked him up off of his horse from either side and dropped him to the ground. A company of men from the encampment then arrived, chased away the fleeing Indians, and recovered the herd, but Smith&#x27;s horse was stolen.

Smith and his family remained at Winter Quarters until the spring of 1848 when Smith drove his mother&#x27;s wagon across the plains to the Salt Lake Valley.

===Utah childhood===
After arriving in the Salt Lake Valley in 1848, Smith&#x27;s mother worked to raise her own children as well as the children of her husband&#x27;s first wife. Mary Fielding Smith died in 1852, apparently of pneumonia, leaving Smith an orphan at the age of 13. Smith reported that he was devastated by his mother&#x27;s death, and relied upon the emotional support and help of Brigham Young and his stepfather, Heber C. Kimball. Even with the support of his older half-brother John Smith, Smith assumed primary responsibility for his young sister, Martha Ann, and subsequently left school in 1854. His leaving school was closely linked to his resistance of a teacher&#x27;s attempt to whip Martha.

===Missions and military service===
At the age of fifteen, Smith was called to go on his first LDS mission to the Sandwich Islands under the direction of apostle Parley P. Pratt. This mission assignment at an unusually young age happened after Smith assaulted a teacher who he felt was unfairly punishing another student; decades later Smith wrote in the LDS publication &quot;Improvement Era&quot; of the burning rage and explosive temper of his youth which he blamed in part on his reaction to the deaths of his parents. Smith was ordained an elder by George A. Smith on April 24, 1854, and received his endowment at the Endowment House the same day. He then traveled to San Bernardino, California, where he worked to earn money for passage on a ship to San Francisco. In the San Francisco area, possibly in what is now Fremont, California, on the farm of John Horner, he was again employed in agricultural pursuits seeking to earn money for passage to Hawaii.

After a difficult period of adjustment to the local culture, Smith successfully learned the Hawaiian language and reported great success in four years of missionary work on the islands. Besides serving with various American companions on his mission, he also had two Hawaiian companions: Paake, who was a property manager for some of Jonathan Napela&#x27;s property, and Lalawaia. He spent the first part of his mission on Maui, but later presided over groups of branches on the island of Hawaii and then over all LDS Church units on Molokai.

Smith was called back to Utah Territory in 1857, largely as a result of the Utah War. He traveled overland from San Francisco to San Bernardino and then north through Las Vegas on his return. He arrived in Utah in February 1858. Shortly after this, Smith joined the territory&#x27;s militia, named the Nauvoo Legion, and spent several months patrolling the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. Later in his tour of duty, he served as chaplain of Colonel Heber C. Kimball&#x27;s regiment, with the rank of captain. After tensions between the church and the federal government abated, Smith assisted his relatives in their return to northern Utah from areas of southern Utah, where they had taken their families for safety.

During the 1858–59 session of the Utah territorial legislature, Smith served as the sergeant-at-arms. In 1859, he married his first wife, Levira Smith. In the LDS Church, Smith was ordained a seventy in March 1858 and then a high priest and a member of the Salt Lake Stake high council in October 1858.
In 1860, at 22 years of age, Smith was sent on a mission to Great Britain. He and his cousin, Samuel H. B. Smith, drove mule teams over the plains to Winter Quarters to help pay their way. Shortly after arriving in England, Smith was made the conference president in Sheffield. Among the church members in that city was William Fowler; Smith was present at the meeting where Fowler&#x27;s hymn &quot;We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet&quot; was first sung. After a short time, Smith was appointed to the pastorate, an office that existed only in the British Mission for a short time. In this position, he presided over the Sheffield Conference as well as four other adjacent conferences. He served in the British Mission for three years, the last part under mission president George Q. Cannon, when he was sent on short assignments to Denmark and France. Smith left England in June 1863. After a short stay in New York City to earn enough money to return home, he served as the chaplain of a Mormon pioneer wagon company bound for Utah from Nebraska.

Smith had only been home for a short while when he was called to accompany Ezra T. Benson, Lorenzo Snow, William W. Cluff, and Alma L. Smith on a mission to the Sandwich Islands to correct the problems in the church caused by Walter M. Gibson. Gibson misrepresented his blessing from Brigham Young as an appointment to be a leader in the church, and then established a separate church with a quorum of the 12, calling himself a prophet, and charging people to receive the priesthood. Smith acted as principal interpreter for the apostles, and after Gibson was excommunicated, Smith was left in charge of the mission. Smith returned home in the winter of 1864–65. Prior to leaving Hawai&#x27;i Smith and William W. Cluff located a new gathering place for the Saints in Laie, Hawaii.

Smith had a notable experience during this mission. The group anchored their boat in a rough channel in order to go ashore, proposing that the party should land using the freight boat. Smith was strongly opposed to this, saying that the boat was unfit for the rough waters and that there was a great danger of capsizing. He offered to go ashore alone to obtain a boat fit to transport the party, to which they refused. They were persistent, however, chiding him for his waywardness, with one leader even saying, &quot;Young man, you would be better to obey counsel.&quot; Smith then reiterated his impression of danger, imploring them not to go, but they insisted, so he asked that they leave their satchels, clothes, and valuables and permit him to stay. They reluctantly consented and set out for land. Partway there, the freight boat was overturned by the rough water about 20 or 30 feet deep, and Lorenzo Snow nearly drowned in the ocean. Snow&#x27;s unconscious body was recovered, and on shore they were able to resuscitate him. Thanks to Smith&#x27;s actions, all of their belongings were saved.

===Clerical and political career===

Upon his return home, Smith was employed in the Church Historian&#x27;s office for a number of years. It was while working in this position he met his second wife, Julina Lambson, who was a niece of Bathsheba W. Smith, a wife of church apostle George A. Smith.

Smith also served as a clerk in the Endowment House from the death of Brigham Young until the building was razed in 1890. Smith&#x27;s latter mission to Hawaii was largely prompted by the fact that Smith held this position: since he had in his possession the records of the Endowment House, Smith could be a valuable witness for the federal government&#x27;s prosecutions of Mormon polygamists.

Smith served seven terms in the Utah territorial House of Representatives, specifically from 1865 to 1870, 1872, and 1874. He was a member of the Salt Lake City Council for many years and in this position was a key advocate of establishing city parks. He was thus one of the people involved with the establishment of Pioneer Park and Liberty Park in Salt Lake City. In 1868 and 1869, Smith served as a member of the Provo City Council. Smith served as a member of the Utah Territorial Council, essentially the equivalent of the upper house of the legislature, in 1880 and 1882. He also served as president of the Utah constitutional convention in 1882. The state constitution produced by this convention did not go into effect because Congress did not vote to grant Utah statehood until 1895.

Smith also served as a LDS Church representative on boards of many Utah businesses.

==Marriages and family==
===Levira Annette Clark Smith===

On April 5, 1859, the twenty year old Smith married his sixteen-year-old cousin, Levira Annette Clark Smith, daughter of Samuel H. Smith, performed by Brigham Young in his office. When Joseph F. Smith left on his mission to England the next year, his companion for the journey was Levira&#x27;s brother, Samuel. When Smith returned from his mission in 1863, his wife Levira was in a poor mental state, suffering from what was most likely major depression. She would spend weeks at a time unable to get out of bed or function during Smith&#x27;s mission, during which time Brigham Young acted &quot;with kind and fatherly care.&quot; Smith wrote of the state he found Levira upon returning home, &quot;emaciated, enfeebled ... a mere shadow of her former self.&quot; Smith became her primary caregiver during the next six months, before Brigham Young assigned him to another mission in Hawaii.

Levira left to live with relatives in California in September 1864. When Smith returned to California in November 1864 Levira did not feel well enough to return to Utah in the winter time. Smith disagreed and they departed on a wagon train to Utah, but she only made it as far as Dutch Flats, Nevada before becoming too ill to continue. After consulting local women, Smith decided the best course of action for Levira would be to return to San Francisco. Upon returning to San Francisco, Levira began to bleed heavily off and on for the next six months, and was informed by a doctor she had probably miscarried.

As Levira and Smith stayed apart, their letters grew more acrimonious. By summer of 1865 it became clear that Levira did not want to return to Utah, and was worried Smith was considering taking on a plural wife. In July 1865 Levira made arrangements with Brigham Young to return to Utah, which Smith found insulting. Levira spent much of the time in Utah living with her mother. When Smith did take a plural wife in spring of 1866, he said Levira &quot;freely gave her consent thereto.&quot; Shortly thereafter Levira permanently moved out to live with her mother. 

====Divorce====

On June 10, 1867 Levira filed for legal separation. By August 1867, the fighting between Levira and Smith attracted the attention of Brigham Young, who intervened. Young asked Levira to list her grievances. Levira stated that Smith was verbally abusive, discounting her illness and once stating that she &quot;ought to have a hole bored in the top of [her] head and some manure put into it for brains,&quot; and that telling her that the inability to have children allowed her to &quot;whore it up.&quot; Levira recounted that Smith walked into a room where a man had been reading to her alone, and &quot;he called me a d_m whore a little damned illegitimate whore and a liar and if he ever caught a man in my room again there would be bloodshed if he had to swing for it, he threw my chair back against the stove.&quot; Smith responded that his comment about &quot;manure&quot; was &quot;in jest,&quot; and stated regarding finding Levira alone being read to, &quot;I do believe believe that if I had been armed I would have done violence.&quot; Levira also accused Smith of physical violence towards her, striking her with a rope. Smith responded that it was not with a rope, but with a peach tree branch as thick as an &quot;office pencil,&quot; framing the violence in the 19th century context of the legal right of a husband to punish his wife, according to Smith, &quot;like a willful and disobedient child.&quot;

Levira moved to California and divorced him on grounds of adultery with Smith&#x27;s second wife, Julina Lambson. Smith and Levira had no children.

===Later marriages and children===
Seven years after his first marriage (1866), Brigham Young directed Smith to take a plural wife, Julina Lambson (who became the mother of future president Joseph Fielding Smith).

In addition to Levira, Smith had five other plural wives, with whom he fathered forty-five children. He also adopted five children. Thirteen of his biological children preceded him in death: Mercy, Leonora, Sarah Ellen, Heber, Rhoda, Alice, Hyrum, Alfred, Albert, Robert, Zina, Ruth, and John. His adopted son Edward also preceded him in death.

One of Smith&#x27;s granddaughters, Amelia Smith, married Bruce R. McConkie, who later became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

==General authority==
On July 1, 1866, Smith became a general authority of the LDS Church when he was ordained an apostle by Brigham Young and sustained as a counselor to the First Presidency, where he served until Young&#x27;s death. However, he was not sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until the church&#x27;s October 1867 conference. On February 28, 1874, Smith left for his second mission to England, serving as president of the European Mission from 1874 to 1875, returning home upon the death of First Presidency member George A. Smith. He was then called to preside over the Davis Stake until he left again in the spring of 1877 for his third mission to England. When news arrived of the death of Young, Smith was released and returned home. The following year, Smith served an Eastern States Mission with Orson Pratt, visiting noteworthy places in the history of the church in Missouri, Ohio, New York and Illinois. During this trip they met with and interviewed David Whitmer.

In October 1880, three years after Young&#x27;s death, Smith was named second counselor in the First Presidency to church president John Taylor, serving from 1880 to 1887. He later served as second counselor to Wilford Woodruff (1889–98), and as second counselor to Lorenzo Snow (1898–1901). Smith was appointed first counselor to Snow on the death of first counselor George Q. Cannon, but, as Snow himself died only four days later, Smith never served in that position. He succeeded Snow as president of the LDS Church and president of the Salt Lake Temple. He served as president of the temple until 1911, when he transferred the responsibility to Anthon H. Lund.

Smith also served as editor of the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; and &quot;Juvenile Instructor&quot;, and general superintendent of the Sunday School and Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association.

Church president Wilford Woodruff issued his Manifesto proscribing new polygamist marriages in September 1890. Smith&#x27;s reaction to the Manifesto reveal that the church&#x27;s movement away from polygamy was an incremental process rather than an abrupt turnaround. Smith wrote to one of his plural wives that the Manifesto would not affect their marriage at all, but simply prevented those who had not yet entered into plural marriages from doing so.

Smith felt it was important for Utah to become a state, and thereby eliminate the ongoing federal supervision of Utah Territory. Following Woodruff&#x27;s official discontinuance of new plural marriages in 1890 and the dissolution of the Mormon People&#x27;s Party in 1891, Smith championed the anti-polygamy Republican Party in Utah.

In September 1891, Smith received a presidential pardon from U.S. President Benjamin Harrison in relation to Smith&#x27;s practice of plural marriage.

==LDS Church President==

After the death of church president Lorenzo Snow, Smith was chosen by the apostles of the church as Snow&#x27;s successor. Smith was set apart as President of the Church on October 17, 1901, with Presiding Patriarch John Smith acting as voice. This action was ratified by a special conference and solemn assembly of the priesthood on November 10, 1901. He chose John R. Winder and Anthon H. Lund as his counselors. After Winder died, Lund became the first counselor and Smith&#x27;s second cousin, John Henry Smith, became the second counselor.

===Polygamy issues===
One of the first issues Smith faced was the ongoing difficulties for the church due to the continuing practice of plural marriage. Smith supported apostle Reed Smoot&#x27;s candidacy for the U.S. Senate, but Smoot&#x27;s election was contested on the grounds that he was an officer in a church which continued to countenance polygamous marriages. The Senate investigation again focused national attention on Mormon marriages and political influence. Additional attention was given to Smith because of his opposition to the election and re-election of Utah&#x27;s senior U.S. Senator, non-Mormon Thomas Kearns. Following his appearance before a Senate panel in 1904, Smith took steps to prevent any surreptitious addition of new plural marriages within the church. On April 6, 1904, Smith issued an order and declaration in the general conference of the church, popularly referred to as the &quot;second manifesto&quot;, and declared that any church officer who performed a plural marriage, as well as the offending couple, would be excommunicated. He clarified that the church&#x27;s policy against new plural marriages applied worldwide, and not just in the United States. Two members of the Quorum of the Twelve, John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley, resigned in 1905 following these announcements. Smith continued to live with his five plural wives as did other Mormon polygamists. In 1906, Smith was brought to trial on a charge of unlawful cohabitation with four women in addition to his lawful wife; he pleaded guilty and was fined $300, the maximum penalty then permitted under the law.

===Other actions===
Smith gave more influence to the Presiding Patriarch of the church than had any president since Joseph Smith. The church&#x27;s presiding patriarch, John Smith, was his elder half-brother. During his presidency, Smith apparently pushed to change the order in which church leaders were sustained in general conferences. He intended to have the presiding patriarch sustained before even himself (as president of the church), consistent with his interpretation of Doctrine and Covenants Section 124 and early historical precedent. This met with opposition from the other apostles, and the proposal was not realized.

In 1906, Smith went on a tour to Europe, becoming the first LDS Church president to travel outside of North America during his presidential tenure.

In 1908, Smith organized a committee to standardize and reform the Aaronic Priesthood quorums. This committee standardized the age requirements for young men to be ordained to the office of Teacher or Priest.

Smith&#x27;s seventeen-year presidential administration made efforts toward improving the church&#x27;s damaged relationships with the federal government and related issues dealing with the church&#x27;s financial situation. The administration acquired historic sites, constructed numerous meetinghouses, and expanded the church system of educational academies and universities. He also oversaw a continued growth in church membership.

During Smith&#x27;s presidential tenure, the LDS Church constructed and dedicated the Joseph Smith Birthplace Memorial near South Royalton, Vermont. It was dedicated by Smith on December 23, 1905, the 100th anniversary of Joseph Smith&#x27;s birth. Also during Smith&#x27;s presidency, the Seagull Monument at Temple Square in Salt Lake City was dedicated on October 1, 1913. In 1913, Boy Scouting became the official youth activity program for the church&#x27;s young men. During much of his presidential tenure, Smith oversaw the planning and construction of the Hawaiian Temple in Laie, Hawaii, one of his part-time residences.

===Death===
Smith died of pneumonia resulting from pleurisy in Salt Lake City on November 19, 1918, and was succeeded by Heber J. Grant. Due to the widespread influenza pandemic of 1918–20, a graveside service was held, rather than a public funeral. Smith was interred in the Salt Lake City Cemetery on November 22, 1918.

==Doctrinal contributions==
During his administration as president of the church, Smith made significant official statements of church doctrine:

*&quot;The Origin of Man&quot;: In November 1909, in the midst of public interest in theories of evolution, the First Presidency issued a statement that affirmed that God created man in his own image. The document also succinctly reiterates the Mormon doctrine of a twofold creation (spiritual followed by temporal), the premortal existence of man, and ends noting that man, as a child of God, is capable of evolving into a god.
*&quot;The Father and the Son&quot;: On June 20, 1916, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued a statement examining the Mormon use of the term &quot;Father&quot; in scripture, clarifying times when the word refers to God the Father and when the word refers to Jesus Christ. The statement identified four different uses of the word &quot;Father.&quot; God the Father is the literal parent of the spirits of mankind and the earthly father of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is referred to as &quot;the Father&quot; when discussing his role as creator of the earth, when he acts as &quot;the Father&quot; of those who abide in his gospel, and when he acts with the authority of his Heavenly Father while on earth.
*&quot;Vision of the Redemption of the Dead&quot;: On October 3, 1918, Smith received a revelation on the nature of the spirit world and on Jesus Christ&#x27;s role in ensuring that the gospel is taught to all men, living and dead. A written account of the revelation was submitted to the general authorities of the church on October 31, 1918, and was unanimously accepted. The revelation was initially published in December 1918, and was added to the Pearl of Great Price, one of the church&#x27;s scriptural standard works, in April 1976; it has since been removed from the Pearl of Great Price and added to the Doctrine and Covenants as section 138. This revelation complemented an 1894 statement on the eternal nature of the family and appropriate temple work for the dead issued by Woodruff. Genealogy work by members of the LDS Church increased after both of these statements.

Funded by Lorenzo N. Stohl, the sermons and writings of Smith were compiled by John A. Widtsoe, Osborne J. P. Widtsoe, Albert E. Bowen, Franklin S. Harris, and Joseph Quinney. In 1919, the Committee on Study for the Priesthood Quorums of the LDS Church had this work published as the book &quot;Gospel Doctrine&quot;, for use as instruction for Melchizedek priesthood quorums of the church.

Smith&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2000–01 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

<text>David Oman McKay (September 8, 1873 – January 18, 1970)&lt;ref name=&quot;lds.org/manual&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was an American religious leader and educator who served as the ninth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1951 until his death in 1970. Ordained an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1906, McKay was an active general authority for nearly 64 years, longer than anyone else in LDS Church history. (Eldred G. Smith was a general authority for 66 years, but only served actively for 32 years, prior to being designated as emeritus.)

==Early life==
The third child of David McKay and Jennette Eveline Evans McKay, McKay was born on his father’s farm in Huntsville, Utah Territory, about east of Ogden. McKay&#x27;s mother was a Welsh immigrant from Merthyr Tydfil, and his father was a Scottish immigrant from Caithness. In 1880, after the death of McKay’s two older sisters, Margaret and Ellena, his father was called as a missionary to his native Scotland, where he proselytized for two years. In his father&#x27;s absence, seven-year-old David had additional family responsibilities and helped his mother.

McKay&#x27;s grandmother bequeathed $5,000 to McKay&#x27;s mother upon her death and directed that &quot;every cent ... be used for the education of the children.&quot; This money allowed McKay, his brother Thomas, and his younger sisters, Jeanette and Annie, to attend the University of Utah. McKay graduated in 1897 as valedictorian and class president.

Immediately afterward, he was called on a mission to Great Britain. Like his father, he presided over the Scottish district of the church. Early in his mission, he was impressed by a motto that he saw inscribed on a building in Stirling, &quot;What E&#x27;er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part&quot;. This message became a source of inspiration throughout his life.

==Career in education==

Upon his return from Scotland in late 1899, McKay taught at the high school level at LDS Weber Stake Academy (predecessor of Weber State University). He married Emma Ray Riggs in the Salt Lake Temple on January 2, 1901. They eventually had seven children, one dying as a young child.For his first three years at Weber, McKay taught mainly religion and literature classes. On April 17, 1902, McKay was appointed principal of Weber, succeeding the founding principal, Louis F. Moench, who had resigned after nine years in the position. One of his first actions as principal was to organize a school paper. He oversaw the inauguration of sports programs at Weber, with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams organized during McKay&#x27;s tenure. In 1905, they won their baseball game against the University of Utah.

In 1905, church apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve due to disagreement over the manifesto forbidding polygamy, and apostle Marriner W. Merrill died in early 1906. With three vacancies, George F. Richards, Orson F. Whitney, and McKay were called as apostles during the LDS Church&#x27;s April 1906 general conference. McKay was then 32 years of age.

Prior to this appointment to full-time church service, McKay had planned on a career in education and educational administration. He stayed active in education even after his appointment, continuing as principal of the Weber Stake Academy until 1908 (replaced by Wilford M. McKendrick). McKay stayed at Weber Stake Academy to see the completion of new building projects that he had begun. He also served on the Weber school&#x27;s board of trustees until 1922, and on the University of Utah&#x27;s board of regents from 1921 to 1922.

McKay enjoyed a long, personal friendship with John F. Fitzpatrick, who published the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; from 1924 until 1960. They met weekly for breakfast to discuss the betterment of Utah. Fitzpatrick organized the Newspaper Agency Corporation, a joint operating agreement between the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; (represented as the Kearns Corporation) and the church-owned &quot;Deseret News&quot;, and consulted extensively with McKay to form this mutually beneficial business in 1952.

==Member of the Quorum of the Twelve==

In October 1906, McKay became an assistant to the superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union. At the time, Joseph F. Smith was both the church president and the superintendent of the Sunday School, so many of the actual duties of the Sunday School were performed by McKay. After Smith&#x27;s death in November 1918, McKay became the Sunday School superintendent.

In 1920, the First Presidency assigned McKay to make a worldwide tour of the LDS Church&#x27;s missions with Hugh J. Cannon, who recorded the journey of some 61,646 miles. They opened a new mission to China, traveled to Hawaii (where McKay had a vision, promising to build a school near the temple), and visited Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, and Palestine. In Palestine they met Wilford Booth and visited Armenian Latter-day Saints. McKay returned to Utah on Christmas Eve 1921.

From 1923 until 1925, McKay served as president of the church&#x27;s European Mission, headquartered in London, with the responsibility of all LDS Church functions in the British Isles and supervision of mission presidents. In this position, McKay first used the slogan &quot;every member a missionary&quot; for outreach promotion. The philosophy has since been taught as a general theme throughout the church.

In 1934, McKay became second counselor to Heber J. Grant in the First Presidency. He served in that capacity until Grant&#x27;s death in May 1945, and when Grant was succeeded by George Albert Smith, McKay was called to continue as second counselor.

==Influence on education==
Within the leadership of the LDS Church, McKay focused on education. As General Superintendent of the church&#x27;s Sunday School organization from 1918 to 1934, McKay built seminaries near public high schools throughout Utah, allowing students to take Latter-day Saint religious courses along with their secular high school education. McKay also transferred three LDS colleges to the state of Utah in the 1920s: Snow College, Weber State University (WSU) and Dixie College. Utah underfunded the institutions and in 1953 the governor, J. Bracken Lee, offered to give them back to the LDS Church. McKay, then president of the church, said he would accept them and the proposal was placed on the 1954 election ballot. Since it failed to pass, the three institutions remained property of the state.

McKay guided the remaining church school in Utah, Brigham Young University (BYU) into a full four-year university. McKay was the fourth Commissioner of Church Education in 1920 and 1921.

In honor of his service, the BYU School of Education was named the McKay School of Education. WSU&#x27;s school of education also carries his name.

== President of the LDS Church ==
Heber J. Grant chose McKay to serve as second counselor in the First Presidency in 1934. He served in the presidency under Grant, and then under George Albert Smith, until 1951. In 1950, he also became President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles when his predecessor, George F. Richards died, making McKay the second most senior apostle after the church&#x27;s president. He was set apart as president of the church on April 9, 1951, upon Smith&#x27;s death. He was 77 years old upon assuming the presidency, and served for 19 years until his death. During this time, the number of members and stakes in the LDS Church nearly tripled, from 1.1 million to 2.8 million, and 184 to 500 respectively.

McKay was an outspoken critic of communism, opposing its perceived atheist underpinnings and denial of freedom of choice. Similarly, communist nations generally forbid proselytizing by the LDS Church and most other religions.

In 1951, McKay began plans for what eventually became BYU-Hawaii. In 1954 he made another trip around the world, visiting Brazil, South Africa, Fiji, Tonga, and other countries.

Under McKay&#x27;s administration, the LDS Church&#x27;s stance on Africans holding the priesthood was softened. Beginning in the mid-1950s, members of suspected African descent no longer needed to prove their lineage was &quot;not&quot; African, allowing dark-skinned members to receive the priesthood unless it was proved that they &quot;were&quot; of African descent. This policy improved proselytizing in racially mixed areas, such as South America and South Africa. Blacks of verifiable African descent (including most in the United States) were not permitted to hold the priesthood until eight years after McKay&#x27;s death.

Beginning in 1961, the LDS Church spearheaded the Priesthood Correlation Program. By the 1970s, all church organizations were placed under direct priesthood leadership. These organizations became known as auxiliary organizations.

Film director Cecil B. DeMille consulted with McKay during the production of his 1956 epic film &quot;The Ten Commandments,&quot; forming a friendship lasting until DeMille&#x27;s death. McKay invited DeMille to BYU, where he delivered a commencement address in 1957.

McKay regularly traveled until he was in his 90s. His deteriorating health in the mid-1960s ultimately led to the appointment of three additional counselors in the First Presidency, as existing members were increasingly infirm and often unable to preside at meetings. By 1968, the First Presidency was composed of six members, larger than it had been at the death of Brigham Young in 1877. McKay&#x27;s counselors in the First Presidency were Stephen L Richards (First Counselor, 1951–59); J. Reuben Clark, Jr. (Second Counselor (1951–59, First Counselor 1959–61); Henry D. Moyle (Second Counselor 1959–61, First Counselor 1961–63); Hugh B. Brown (Third Counselor 1961, Second Counselor 1961–63, First Counselor 1963–70); N. Eldon Tanner (Second Counselor, 1963–70); Thorpe B. Isaacson (Counselor, 1965–70); Joseph Fielding Smith (Counselor, 1965–70); Alvin R. Dyer (Counselor, 1968–70).

==Death==
McKay died on January 18, 1970, at age 96, surrounded by most of his family. The cause of death was acute congestion. Funeral services were held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.

==Family ties==
His younger brother, Thomas Evans McKay, was a prominent missionary and mission leader for the LDS Church in Switzerland and Germany; he also served as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from 1941 to 1958.

McKay&#x27;s niece, Fawn McKay Brodie, was the author of the controversial book &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;, a highly critical biography of Joseph Smith, the publication of which led to her eventual excommunication from the LDS Church.

McKay&#x27;s oldest son, David Lawrence McKay, was the eighth general superintendent of the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday School organization. When his father was ill, David often read his father&#x27;s sermons during general conference.

One of McKay&#x27;s granddaughters is Joyce McKay Bennett, wife of former United States Senator Bob Bennett. Another grandchild, Alan Ashton, was the co-founder and co-owner of computer program &quot;WordPerfect&quot;.

The Events Center at Utah Valley University in Orem, the David O. McKay Events Center, carried McKay&#x27;s name between 1996 and 2010, after an anonymous donation was given in his honor. In 2010, the name was changed (to &quot;Utah Community Credit Center&quot;) due to a fund-raising need at the university, and McKay&#x27;s name was affixed to the university&#x27;s Education Center instead. 

==Teachings==
McKay was concerned with missionary work, and coined the phrase &quot;Every member a missionary&quot; in order to encourage church members to become more engaged in that work, and not just leave it to the full-time missionaries.

McKay&#x27;s statement that &quot;[n]o other success can compensate for failure in the home&quot; is taught to LDS Church members as an important principle.

McKay&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2005 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

<text>A quarter tone is a pitch halfway between the usual notes of a chromatic scale or an interval about half as wide (orally, or logarithmically) as a semitone, which itself is half a whole tone. Quarter tones divide the octave by 50 cents each, and have 24 different pitches.
Quarter tones have their roots in the music of the Middle East and more specifically in Persian traditional music. However, the first evidenced proposal of the equally-tempered quarter tone scale, or 24 equal temperament, was made by 19th-century music theorists Heinrich Richter in 1823 and Mikhail Mishaqa about 1840. Composers who have written music using this scale include: Pierre Boulez, Julián Carrillo, Mildred Couper, George Enescu, Alberto Ginastera, Gérard Grisey, Alois Hába, Ljubica Marić, Charles Ives, Tristan Murail, Krzysztof Penderecki, Giacinto Scelsi, Ammar El Sherei, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Tui St. George Tucker, Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Iannis Xenakis, and Seppe Gebruers (See List of quarter tone pieces.)

==Types==
===Equal-tempered tuning systems===


The term &quot;quarter tone&quot; can refer to a number of different intervals, all very close in size. For example, some 17th- and 18th-century theorists used the term to describe the distance between a sharp and enharmonically distinct flat in mean-tone temperaments (e.g., D–E). In the quarter-tone scale, also called 24-tone equal temperament (24-TET), the quarter tone is 50 cents, or a frequency ratio of or approximately 1.0293, and divides the octave into 24 equal steps (equal temperament). In this scale the quarter tone is the smallest step. A semitone is thus made of two steps, and three steps make a three-quarter tone or neutral second, half of a minor third. The 8-TET scale is composed of three-quarter tones. Four steps make a whole tone.

Quarter tones and intervals close to them also occur in a number of other equally tempered tuning systems. 22-TET contains an interval of 54.55 cents, slightly wider than a quarter-tone, whereas 53-TET has an interval of 45.28 cents, slightly smaller. 72-TET also has equally tempered quarter-tones, and indeed contains three quarter-tone scales, since 72 is divisible by 24. The smallest interval in 31 equal temperament (the &quot;diesis&quot; of 38.71 cents) is half a chromatic semitone, one-third of a diatonic semitone and one-fifth of a whole tone, so it may function as a quarter tone, a fifth-tone &quot;or&quot; a sixth-tone.

===Just intonation tuning systems===
In just intonation the quarter tone can be represented by the septimal quarter tone, 36:35 (48.77 cents), or by the undecimal quarter tone (i.e. the thirty-third harmonic), 33:32 (53.27 cents), approximately half the semitone of 16:15 or 25:24. The ratio of 36:35 is only 1.23 cents narrower than a 24-TET quarter tone. This just ratio is also the difference between a minor third (6:5) and septimal minor third (7:6).

Composer Ben Johnston, to accommodate the just septimal quarter tone, uses a small &quot;7&quot; () as an accidental to indicate a note is lowered 49 cents, or an upside down &quot;7&quot; () to indicate a note is raised 49 cents, or a ratio of 36:35. Johnston uses an upward and downward arrow to indicate a note is raised or lowered by a ratio of 33:32, or 53 cents. The Maneri-Sims notation system designed for 72-et uses the accidentals and for a quarter tone (36:35 or 48.77 cents) up and down.

== Playing quarter tones ==
Any tunable musical instrument can be used to perform quarter tones, if two players and two identical instruments, with one tuned a quarter tone higher, are used. As this requires neither a special instrument nor special techniques, much quarter toned music is written for pairs of pianos, violins, harps, etc. The retuning of the instrument, and then returning it to its former pitch, is easy for violins, harder for harps, and slow and relatively expensive for pianos.

The following deals with the ability of single instruments to produce quarter tones. In Western instruments, this means &quot;in addition to the usual 12-tone system&quot;. Because many musical instruments manufactured today (2018) are designed for the 12-tone scale, not all are usable for playing quarter tones. Sometimes special playing techniques must be used.

Conventional musical instruments that &quot;cannot&quot; play quarter tones (except by using special techniques—see below) include:
* Most standard or unmodified non-electronic keyboard instruments, such as pianos, organs, and accordions
* Fretted string instruments such as guitars, bass guitars, and ukuleles (though on these it is possible to play quarter tones by pitch-bending, with special tunings, or with customized necks)
* Pitched percussion instruments, if standard techniques are used, and if the instruments are not tunable
* Western wind instruments that use keys or valves
** Woodwind instruments, such as clarinets, saxophones, flutes, and oboes (though with many of these, it is still possible using non-standard techniques such as special fingerings or by the player manipulating their embouchure, to play at least &quot;some&quot; quarter tones, if not a whole scale)
** Valved brass instruments (trumpet, tuba) (though, as with woodwinds, embouchure manipulation, as well as harmonic tones that fall closer to quarter-tones than half-tones, make quarter-tone scales possible; the horn technique of adjusting pitch with the right hand in the bell makes this instrument an exception)
* Harmonica (although note bending is a common technique)

Conventional musical instruments that &quot;can&quot; play quarter tones include
* Electronic instruments:
** Synthesizers, using either special keyboard controllers or continuous-pitch controllers such as fingerboard controllers, or when controlled by a sequencer capable of outputting quarter-tone control signals.
** Theremins and other continuously pitched instruments
* Fretless string instruments, such as the violin family, fretless guitars, fretless electric basses, ouds, and members of the huqin family of instruments.
* String instruments with movable frets (such as the sitar)
* Specially fretted string instruments (such as the Turkish bağlama).
* Fretted string instruments specially tuned to quarter tones
* Pedal steel guitar
* certain non-valved wind instruments, like Duduk
* Wind instruments whose main means of tone-control is a slide, such as trombones, the tromboon invented by P. D. Q. Bach, the slide trumpet and the slide whistle
* Specially keyed woodwind instruments. A quarter tone clarinet was built by Fritz Schüller (1883–1977) of Markneukirchen, and a quarter tone mechanism for flutes by Eva Kingma.
* Valved brass instruments with extra, quarter-tone valves, and natural brass instruments that play through the 11th and 13th partials of the harmonic series
* Voice
* Kazoo
* Pitched percussion instruments, when tuning permits (e.g., timpani), or using special techniques

Other instruments can be used to play quarter tones when using audio signal processing effects such as pitch shifting.

Quarter-tone pianos have been built, which consist essentially of two pianos with two keyboards stacked one above the other in a single case, one tuned a quarter tone higher than the other.

== Music of the Middle East ==
Many Persian dastgah and Arabic &quot;maqamat&quot; contain intervals of three-quarter tone size; a short list of these follows.

=== Quarter-tone scale ===
Known as &quot;gadwal&quot; in Arabic, the quarter-tone scale was developed in the Middle East in the eighteenth century and many of the first detailed writings in the nineteenth century Syria describe the scale as being of 24 equal tones.
The invention of the scale is attributed to Mishaqa who wrote a book devoted to the topic but made clear that his teacher, Sheikh Muhammad al-Attar (1764–1828), was one among many already familiar with the concept.

&lt;/score&gt;

The quarter tone scale may be primarily a theoretical construct in Arabic music. The quarter tone gives musicians a &quot;conceptual map&quot; they can use to discuss and compare intervals by number of quarter tones, and this may be one of the reasons it accompanies a renewed interest in theory, with instruction in music theory a mainstream requirement since that period.

Previously, pitches of a mode were chosen from a scale consisting of seventeen tones, developed by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi in the thirteenth century.
Composer Charles Ives chose the chord C–D–F–G–B as good possibility for a &quot;secondary&quot; chord in the quarter-tone scale, akin to the minor chord of traditional tonality. He considered that it may be built upon any degree of the quarter tone scale Here is the secondary &quot;minor&quot; and its &quot;first inversion&quot;:

== In popular Western music ==

The bass descent of Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s version of &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27; includes quarter tone descents.
Several quarter-tone albums have been recorded by Jute Gyte, a one-man avantgarde black metal band from Missouri, USA.
Another quartertone metal album was issued by the Swedish band Massive Audio Nerve.
Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard&#x27;s albums &quot;Flying Microtonal Banana&quot;, K.G., and L.W. heavily emphasize quarter-tones and used a custom-built guitar in 24  tuning.
Jazz violinist / violist Mat Maneri, in conjunction with his father Joe Maneri, made a crossover fusion album, &quot;Pentagon&quot; (2005), that featured experiments in hip hop with quarter tone pianos, as well as electric organ and mellotron textures, along with distorted trombone, in a post-Bitches Brew type of mixed jazz / rock.

Later, Seppe Gebruers started playing and improvising with two pianos tuned a quarter-tone apart. In 2019 he started a research project at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent, titled &#x27;Unexplored possibilities of contemporary improvisation and the influence of microtonality in the creation process&#x27;.
With two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart Gebruers recorded &#x27;The Room: Time &amp; Space&#x27; (2018) in a trio formation with drummer Paul Lovens and bassist Hugo Anthunes. In his solo project &#x27;Playing with standards&#x27; (album release January 2023), Gebruers plays with famous songs including jazz standards. With Paul Lytton and Nils Vermeulen he forms a &#x27;Playing with standards&#x27; trio.

== Ancient Greek tetrachords ==
The enharmonic genus of the Greek tetrachord consisted of a ditone or an approximate major third, and a semitone, which was divided into two microtones. Aristoxenos, Didymos and others presented the semitone as being divided into two approximate quarter tone intervals of about the same size, while other ancient Greek theorists described the microtones resulting from dividing the semitone of the enharmonic genus as unequal in size (i.e., one smaller than a quarter tone and one larger).

== Interval size in equal temperament ==
Here are the sizes of some common intervals in a 24-note equally tempered scale, with the interval names proposed by Alois Hába (neutral third, etc.) and Ivan Wyschnegradsky (major fourth, etc.):

Moving from 12-TET to 24-TET allows the better approximation of a number of intervals. Intervals matched particularly closely include the neutral second, neutral third, and (11:8) ratio, or the 11th harmonic. The septimal minor third and septimal major third are approximated rather poorly; the (13:10) and (15:13) ratios, involving the 13th harmonic, are matched very closely. Overall, 24-TET can be viewed as matching the 11th and 13th harmonics more closely than the 7th.

<doc id="639582" wikidata="Q4996884" url="?curid=639582" title="Bullfrog County, Nevada">
<text>Bullfrog County was a county in the U.S. state of Nevada created by the Nevada Legislature in 1987. It comprised a area around Yucca Mountain enclosed by Nye County, from which it was created. Its county seat was located in the state capital of Carson City away, and its officers were appointed by the governor rather than elected.

Created in response to a planned nuclear waste site in the area, it was meant to discourage the construction of the site via high property taxes and to direct funds from the site that would have otherwise gone to Nye County directly to the state government. Its creation produced various legal issues for the state, and critics suggested that its existence prompted a conflict of interest for the state in the site&#x27;s placement. Upon a lawsuit by Nye County, its creation was ruled in violation of the state constitution in 1988, and it was dissolved back into Nye County the following year.

==Background==
The United States federal government had plans to create a disposal site for radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, then within Nye County. Alongside Texas with a site in Deaf Smith County and Washington with the Hanford Site, Nevada was one of three states to be considered for such a site, and like the other two fought it bitterly. The federal government agreed to provide grants equal to taxes to Nye County for the site per the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, bypassing the state government. In response, Nevada Assemblyman Paul May introduced AB 756, a bill declaring a area around the proposed nuclear waste site to be a new county, Bullfrog County. The name derived from the Bullfrog Mining District in the area, in turn named due to the area&#x27;s gold ore being colored like a bullfrog. There had been an earlier attempt to create a Bullfrog County out of southern Nye County in 1909, but Nye County blocked the proposal.

Because this new county had no population, any federal payments for placing the nuclear waste site there would go directly to the state treasury. Furthermore, property tax rates in the county were set at 5 percent, the highest allowable by the state constitution and higher than the statutory limit of 3.64 percent. This tax burden, possibly up to $25 million a year for the state, was meant to deter the waste site&#x27;s creation by making it prohibitively expensive to use the land for a radioactive waste dump. However, it also guaranteed that the waste site would at least provide a large amount of money for the state government if it were ever built. The bill was passed at 3:45 am on June 18, 1987—near the end of the year&#x27;s legislative session—and signed into law by Governor Richard Bryan. The law stipulated that if the repository was not built in the county, it would be dissolved and reincorporated into Nye County.

The county was the second-shortest lived county in American history (behind Beckham County, Kentucky), the only enclave county in the United States, and were it still existent, would be the second-youngest county in the United States.

==Government and infrastructure==

Bullfrog County was the only county in Nevada whose county commissioners and sheriff were not elected. Instead, the law creating the county stipulated that those officials were to be appointed by the governor. Each office—sheriff, recorder, auditor, and public administrator—received a $1 a year salary, and the same person could be appointed to all offices except commissioner simultaneously. Due to a legislative oversight in getting a bill passed to disburse the tax funds, distribution of the funds was put in the hands of the commissioners. The commissioners appointed were chairman Mike Melner of Reno and David Powell and Dorothy Eisenberg of Las Vegas. In the legislature&#x27;s haste to get the bill passed, the county was not assigned to any of the state&#x27;s nine district courts and thus had no district attorney or judiciary. The county seat was in Carson City, away, making it the only county in the U.S. outside Virginia whose seat was not within its borders. This was a deliberate choice to increase state oversight of the site.

The county was the only uninhabited county in the United States. More than three-fourths of its land was closed to the public; half of it was taken up by the Nevada Test Site, and a quarter by the Nellis Air Force Range. The remaining fourth was owned by the Bureau of Land Management, but few people visited there. It contained no paved roads or buildings. The easiest ground access to the county was by way of a dirt road off U.S. Route 95.

==Dissolution==
The existence of Bullfrog County had the potential to create serious legal problems for the state of Nevada. The Nevada Constitution requires all criminal trials to be tried in the county where the crime occurred, and before a jury of residents of that county. However, since it was not assigned to a judicial district, it had no judiciary or prosecutors. If a felony or gross misdemeanor was committed in Bullfrog County, it would have been theoretically impossible to empanel a jury, potentially opening the possibility of a perfect crime. Nevada Attorney General Brian McKay insisted that such cases could be taken care of via &quot;the rule of necessity&quot;, and officials said that it was very unlikely that a crime would be committed in any event. On the other hand, state judge William P. Beko said that anti-nuclear protesters posed &quot;immediate problems&quot; in that respect. The Department of Energy retaliated for the creation of the county by granting nearby Clark County special status and consequent funds. This backfired on the Department, however, as Clark County used that money to fund studies unfavorable to the Yucca Mountain site.

Critics also asserted that the county&#x27;s existence established a conflict of interest and sent a message that the state would support the dump in exchange for the money. U.S. Senator for Nevada Chic Hecht brought up such concerns on the Senate floor on September 18, claiming that the creation of the county was being misinterpreted as an invitation for the site and insisting that Nevadans still opposed the dump.

Supporters of the county argued that it was created to prevent Nye County, many of whose residents wanted the dump due to its economic benefits, from insisting on its placement in Nevada. Despite its history, the name was also subject to some ridicule, and critics suggested that Nevada had become a laughing stock due to the county&#x27;s creation.

Incensed about being sidelined and deprived of its money, Nye County requested that Bryan call a special session of the legislature to repeal the act establishing the county and upon his refusal challenged it in court, claiming it was unconstitutional due to the prohibition on special legislation on counties. In late October 1987, McKay announced that the state would not defend the law in court, since in his view it was likely unconstitutional. On February 11, 1988, retired Supreme Court of Nevada justice David Zenoff conducted a special hearing and found Bullfrog County&#x27;s creation to be unconstitutional. Zenoff found that since Bullfrog County had no residents, it did not have a representative government. He also ruled the provision of the law giving Bryan the power to appoint the commissioners and sheriff ran counter to the democratic process. In compliance, the state legislature abolished Bullfrog County in 1989 and the territory was retroceded to Nye County. Yucca Mountain was ultimately selected as the site of the repository, but its construction has been delayed due to continued opposition from the state and area.

<doc id="639594" wikidata="Q471240" url="?curid=639594" title="Der Rosenkavalier">
<text>&#x27; (The Knight of the Rose or The Rose-Bearer&quot;&quot;&#x27;), Op. 59, is a comic opera in three acts by Richard Strauss to an original German libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal. It is loosely adapted from Louvet de Couvrai&#x27;s novel &quot;Les amours du chevalier de Faublas&quot; and Molière&#x27;s comedy &quot;Monsieur de Pourceaugnac&quot;. It was first performed at the Königliches Opernhaus in Dresden on 26 January 1911 under the direction of Max Reinhardt, with Ernst von Schuch conducting. Until the premiere, the working title was &quot;Ochs auf Lerchenau&quot;. (The choice of the name Ochs is not accidental, as &quot;Ochs&quot; means &quot;ox&quot;, which describes the Baron&#x27;s manner.)

The opera has four main characters: the aristocratic Marschallin; her 17-year-old lover, Count Octavian Rofrano; her brutish cousin Baron Ochs; and Ochs&#x27;s prospective fiancée, Sophie von Faninal, the daughter of a rich bourgeois. At the Marschallin&#x27;s suggestion, Octavian acts as Ochs&#x27;s &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; by presenting a ceremonial silver rose to Sophie. But Octavian and Sophie fall in love on the spot, and soon devise a comic intrigue to extricate Sophie from her engagement, with help from the Marschallin, who then yields Octavian to Sophie. Though a comic opera, the work incorporates weighty themes (particularly through the Marschallin&#x27;s character arc), including infidelity, aging, sexual predation, and selflessness in love.

&quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; is notable for showcasing the female voice, as its protagonists (light lyric soprano Sophie, mezzo-soprano Octavian, and the mature dramatic soprano Marschallin) are written to be portrayed by women, who share several duets as well as a trio at the opera&#x27;s emotional climax. Some singers have performed two or even all three of these roles over the course of their careers.

There are many recordings of the opera and it is regularly performed.

==Composition==

Richard Strauss first met Hugo von Hofmannstal in 1899 in Berlin. Strauss was subsequently impressed by Hofmannsthal&#x27;s play &quot;Elektra&quot; (1903), and adapted it into an opera that premiered on 25 January 1909. During that process, they agreed to collaborate on a new project that would be more comedic in tone. After Strauss rejected Hofmannstal&#x27;s comedy &quot;Christinas Heimreise&quot; and the plays of Molière yielded little fruit, Hofmannsthal visited Harry Graf Kessler in Weimar. Over the course of a few days in February 1909, Hofmannsthal and Kessler drafted a scenario inspired by a 1907 operetta that Kessler had seen in Paris: &quot;L&#x27;Ingénu libertin&quot; by playwright Louis Artus and composer Claude Terrasse.

Strauss approved the plot outline and work began in earnest. Act I&#x27;s text was written in February–March 1909, with its music finished in May. Through the summer, Strauss composed Act II, collaborating with Hofmannstal to add more comedy and plot twists. By spring 1910, the first two acts were printed and Hofmannstal had finished writing the libretto. Strauss finished the final act on 26 September 1910.

The first production was slated to be directed by the Dresden Opera&#x27;s Georg Toller, who had staged the world premiere of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot;, but the creators had subsequently been impressed by the Vienna production of &quot;Elektra&quot; with sets designed by Alfred Roller (director of the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule) and lost faith in Toller. Strauss and Hofmannsthal commissioned Roller to design sets and costumes for &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and arranged for his designs to be published in an illustrated prompt book that all productions would be obligated to use. They also controversially recruited Max Reinhardt to assist with rehearsals as a &quot;shadow director&quot; or replacement for Toller, although Toller remained the sole credited director.

==Performance history==

===Premiere===
&quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; premiered on 26 January 1911 in Dresden conducted by Ernst von Schuch, who had conducted the premieres of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Feuersnot&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Elektra&quot;. Soprano Margarethe Siems (Strauss&#x27;s first Chrysothemis) sang the Marschallin, in a turn that represented the pinnacle of her career, while Minnie Nast portrayed Sophie and Eva von der Osten sang the breeches role of Octavian.

From the start, &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; was nothing short of a triumph: tickets to the premiere reportedly sold out almost immediately, resulting in a financial boom for the house. Though some critics took issue with Strauss&#x27;s anachronistic use of waltz music, the public embraced the opera unconditionally. &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; became Strauss&#x27;s most popular opera during his lifetime and remains a staple of operatic repertoire today.

===International success===
Within two months of its premiere, the work was translated into Italian and performed at La Scala. The Italian cast, led by conductor Tullio Serafin, included Lucrezia Bori as Octavian, Ines Maria Ferraris as Sophie, and Pavel Ludikar as Ochs. The opera&#x27;s Austrian premiere was given by the Vienna Court Opera on the following 8 April, under Franz Schalk&#x27;s baton, with Lucie Weidt as Marschallin, Gertrude Förstel as Sophie substituting for Selma Kurz, Marie Gutheil-Schoder as Octavian and Richard Mayr as Ochs. The work reached the Teatro Costanzi in Rome seven months later on 14 November with Egisto Tango conducting Hariclea Darclée as the Marschallin and Conchita Supervía as Octavian.

The United Kingdom premiere of &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; occurred at the Royal Opera House in London on 29 January 1913. Thomas Beecham conducted the performance and the cast included Margarethe Siems as the Marschallin and Caroline Hatchard as Sophie. The United States premiere took place at the Metropolitan Opera on the following 9 December in a production conducted by Alfred Hertz. The cast included Frieda Hempel as the Marschallin, Margarethe Arndt-Ober as Octavian, and Anna Case as Sophie. A number of Italian theatres produced the work for the first time in the 1920s, including the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi (1921), Teatro Regio di Torino (1923), Teatro di San Carlo (1925), and the Teatro Carlo Felice (1926).

&quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; reached Monaco on 21 March 1926 when it was performed by the Opéra de Monte-Carlo at the Salle Garnier in a French translation. The performance starred Gabrielle Ritter-Ciampi as the Marschallin and Vanni Marcoux as Faninal. 1926 also saw the premiere of a film of the opera. The French premiere of the opera itself came in 1927 at the Palais Garnier in Paris on 11 February 1927 with conductor Philippe Gaubert. The cast included Germaine Lubin as Octavian. Brussels heard the work for the first time at La Monnaie on 15 December 1927 with Clara Clairbert as Sophie.

The Salzburg Festival mounted &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; for the first time on 12 August 1929 in a production conducted by Clemens Krauss. The cast included Lotte Lehmann as the Marschallin and Marta Fuchs as Annina. Other first productions at notable houses, opera festivals, and music ensembles include: Teatro Massimo (5 March 1932), Philadelphia Orchestra (30 November 1934), San Francisco Opera (16 October 1940), Philadelphia Opera Company (2 December 1941), Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (2 May 1942), La Fenice (20 April 1943), Festival dei Due Mondi (19 June 1964), Teatro Comunale di Bologna (19 November 1965), Lyric Opera of Chicago (25 September 1970), and the New York City Opera (19 November 1973), among many others. It was first presented in Australia as a radio broadcast on 7 January 1936, featuring Florence Austral, but the first Australian stage production was not until 1972, by the Australian Opera in Melbourne, conducted by Sir Edward Downes. The first New Zealand performance was at the International Festival of the Arts in Wellington in 2002.

==Synopsis==
:Time: 1740s, in the first years of the reign of Empress Maria Theresa
:Place: Vienna

===Act 1===

&quot;The Marschallin&#x27;s bedroom&quot;

The opera&#x27;s &quot;Einleitung&quot; (Introduction) depicts a night of lovemaking between Princess Marie Therese von Werdenberg (known as the Marschallin, the title given to a Field Marshal&#x27;s wife) and her much younger lover, Count Octavian Rofrano. The curtain rises to show them lounging in bed together just before daybreak (&quot;Wie du warst! Wie du bist&quot;). Loud voices are soon heard outside, and the Marschallin has Octavian hide, believing that her husband has returned early from a hunting trip. Octavian emerges in a skirt and bonnet (&quot;Befehl&#x27;n fürstli&#x27; Gnad&#x27;n, i bin halt noch nit recht...&quot;) and tries to sneak away, but the Marschallin&#x27;s country cousin, Baron Ochs auf Lerchenau, bursts in through the same door.

The Baron is newly engaged to Sophie Faninal (&quot;Selbstverständlich empfängt mich Ihro Gnaden&quot;), a wealthy merchant&#x27;s daughter. This does not keep him from making lewd comments at the disguised Octavian. Ochs has come to ask two favors: he wants to borrow his cousin&#x27;s notary to write the marriage contract, and he wants her to recommend a young nobleman to serve as his Rosenkavalier (&quot;Knight of the Rose&quot;), who will deliver the traditional silver engagement rose to Sophie. The Marschallin instructs &quot;Mariandel&quot; to fetch Octavian&#x27;s miniature portrait and present it to the Baron. Ochs readily accepts Octavian as his Rosenkavalier, deciding that the &quot;maid&quot; must be that young count&#x27;s &quot;bastard sister&quot;, then insists that the Marschallin allow &quot;Mariandel&quot; to come and work for his new bride. She refuses as politely as possible and finally dismisses the &quot;maid&quot;.

A busy reception scene ensues as the room fills with vendors and supplicants to the Marschallin (&quot;Drei arme adelige Waisen&quot;), who ignores the former and aids the latter. A tenor sent by the Portuguese ambassador serenades her (&quot;Di rigori armato&quot;) while Ochs sits down with the notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, present scandal sheets for sale, which the Marschallin coldly declines. Ochs tries to stipulate a gift from Sophie&#x27;s family consisting of all their properties, free from mortgages, and quickly loses patience with the notary&#x27;s attempts to explain that this is illegal. Amid all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: &quot;My dear Hippolyte, today you have made me look like an old woman&quot; (&quot;Mein lieber Hippolyte&quot;). This so disturbs her that she orders the room to be emptied. As the people file out, Valzacchi and Annina offer Ochs their spying services. He asks whether they know anything about &quot;Mariandel&quot;; they lie and claim to know all about her.

Now alone, the Marschallin ponders her waning youth and the unhappiness of her forced marriage, perceiving the same in store for Sophie (&quot;Da geht er hin...&quot;). Octavian returns, dressed again in men&#x27;s clothes (&quot;Ach, du bist wieder da&quot;). When he sees that the Marschallin is out of sorts, he assumes it is from her earlier fear that he might have been discovered. But she is still thinking of the passage of time (a clock is heard chiming 13 times) (&quot;Die Zeit, die ist ein sonderbar Ding&quot;) and tells him that, very soon, he will leave her for someone younger and prettier. Octavian reacts with frustration, and the Marschallin turns him away. Too late, she realizes that she has neglected to kiss him goodbye. With nothing else to be done, she summons her young page, Mohammed, to take the silver rose to Octavian, then stares pensively into her hand mirror (or similar) as the curtain falls.

===Act 2===
&quot;The von Faninals&#x27; palace&quot;

The next day, Herr von Faninal exultantly and Sophie nervously await the Rosenkavalier&#x27;s arrival (&quot;Ein ernster Tag, ein grosser Tag!&quot;). Following tradition, Faninal departs before the Knight appears, saying that he will return with the bridegroom. Sophie prays to keep her sense of humility through all the rapid changes happening in her life, but she is repeatedly interrupted by her duenna, Marianne, who reports from the window on the Rosenkavalier&#x27;s elaborate entourage (&quot;In dieser feierlichen Stunde der Prüfung&quot;). Octavian arrives with great pomp, dressed all in silver, and presents the silver rose to Sophie (&quot;Mir ist die Ehre widerfahren...&quot;). She smells it, saying it is as sweet as a greeting from Heaven itself. Instantly smitten, Octavian joins her avowal that they will remember this moment until death.

They settle into a chaperoned conversation. Sophie reveals that she already knows Octavian&#x27;s full name – Octavian Maria Ehrenreich Bonaventura Fernand Hyacinth Rofrano – from studying the catalogue of Austrian nobility to prepare for her marriage. She even knows his nickname, Quinquin, which only intimate friends (including the Marschallin) call him. She adds that she likes him very much. Ochs then enters with Faninal (&quot;Jetzt aber kommt mein Herr Zukünftiger&quot;) and wastes no time revealing his character to the bride, loudly examining Sophie&#x27;s body and comparing her to &quot;an unbroken filly&quot; when she protests. Once he leaves the room with Faninal to finalize the marriage contract, Sophie and Octavian quickly agree that she will not marry the Baron under any circumstances.

The young lovers&#x27; rapturous duet (&quot;Mit Ihren Augen voll Tränen&quot;) is soon interrupted by Valzacchi and Annina, who surprise them and call for Ochs. Octavian challenges the Baron to a duel. Ochs runs forward, scratches his arm on the point of Octavian&#x27;s drawn sword, and screams so that Faninal and the rest of the household come rushing in. Sophie begs her father to call off the wedding, to no avail: Octavian is asked to leave, and Sophie is sent to her room. Ochs is left on the divan, his arm in a sling, nursing a bottle of Hippocras and fantasies of revenge against Octavian. But Annina brings him something that raises his spirits much more quickly: a letter signed by &quot;Mariandel&quot;, asking for a tryst. At this, Ochs forgets his sling and waltzes across the stage, ignoring Annina&#x27;s hints for a tip – and missing her quiet promise to get even (&quot;Da lieg&#x27; ich!&quot;).

===Act 3===

&quot;A private room in a shabby inn&quot;

Fed up with the Baron, Valzacchi and Annina help Octavian prepare a trap the next evening. Elaborate preparations are seen in pantomime before Ochs arrives with &quot;Mariandel&quot;, ready for a cozy dinner at a table set for two.

Ochs is disturbed by &quot;Mariandel&#x27;s&quot; uncanny resemblance to his nemesis Octavian, and keeps catching glimpses of strange apparitions in the room. A disguised Annina bursts in, calling Ochs her husband and the father of her (numerous) children, who crowd around him, crying, &quot;Papa! Papa!&quot; The Baron calls for the police; to his unpleasant surprise, the vice squad treats &quot;him&quot; with suspicion, and Valzacchi claims not to know him. The police inspector asks about the &quot;woman&quot; accompanying him, and Ochs lies that &quot;she&quot; is his fiancée, Sophie Faninal – just in time for Herr von Faninal to arrive, demanding to know why Ochs&#x27;s messenger (presumably Valzacchi) has summoned him to this disreputable place. When asked if &quot;Mariandel&quot; is his daughter, Faninal retorts in a rage that his daughter is outside. Sophie enters, confirming this assertion, and her apoplectic father staggers out, leaning on her shoulder.

&quot;Mariandel&quot; now offers to make a statement in private, and retires behind a screen with the Police Inspector. Soon Ochs sees articles of women&#x27;s clothing coming into view. He rages against the vice squad, but is interrupted by the Marschallin&#x27;s arrival. The Police Inspector greets her before clearing the room, and she explains to the Baron that he has been fooled. Sophie returns and tells Ochs that their engagement is off; Octavian emerges, and the Marschallin confirms that Octavian, Valzacchi, Annina, and others set up a &quot;masquerade&quot; to break his engagement. Ochs, glancing back and forth between Octavian and the Marschallin, now grasps the nature of their relationship and implies that he may tell the Marschallin&#x27;s husband of it, but he is cowed by the Marschallin&#x27;s force of will (if not the sight of Octavian&#x27;s sword) and ingloriously departs, pursued by children and bill collectors.
The Marschallin, Sophie, and Octavian are left alone, and Octavian does not know what to do. The Marschallin introduces herself to Sophie, recognizing that the day she feared has come (Trio: &quot;Marie Theres&#x27;!&quot; / &quot;Hab&#x27; mir&#x27;s gelobt&quot;), and releases Octavian to be with the woman he loves. She then withdraws, with a promise to Sophie that she will offer Faninal a face-saving ride home in her carriage. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find them locked in an embrace. With a last, bittersweet look toward her lost lover, the Marschallin heads for the carriage with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (&quot;Ist ein Traum&quot; / &quot;Spür&#x27; nur dich&quot;). The opera ends with Mohammed trotting in to retrieve Sophie&#x27;s dropped handkerchief, then racing out again after the others.

==Instrumentation==
Strauss&#x27;s score is written for the following:
* Woodwind: 3 flutes (III doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn (also doubling on 3rd oboe), 3 clarinets (III also clarinet in D &amp; E flat), basset horn (doubles bass clarinet in B flat and A), 3 bassoons (III also contrabassoon)
* Brass: 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, bass tuba
* Percussion: timpani, bass drum and cymbals, triangle, tambourine, glockenspiel, ratchet, tenor drum, snare drum, jingle bells, castanets
* Celesta, 2 harps
* Strings: 16 violins I, 16 violins II, 12 violas, 10 cellos, 8 double basses
* Off-stage: 2 flutes, oboe, 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 French horns, trumpet, drum, harmonium, piano, strings

==&quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; Suite==
In 1945 Strauss allowed an orchestral &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; Suite to be published, but apparently was not involved in creating it. It is likely that conductor Artur Rodziński arranged it, as he conducted the suite&#x27;s first performance, in October 1944 by the New York Philharmonic. Rodziński recorded the suite with the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra of London on Westminster Hi-Fi, XWN 18680 in 1958.

The suite begins with the opera&#x27;s orchestral prelude, depicting the Marschallin&#x27;s and Octavian&#x27;s night of passion (vividly portrayed by whooping horns). Next comes the appearance of Octavian as the &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot;, depicted in tender music; the sight of him looking so young makes the Marschallin realise that he will soon leave her for a younger woman. There follows the duet between Octavian and Sophie (oboe and horn) – in which their love for each other becomes ever more obvious, but this is abruptly interrupted by the discordant music associated with Ochs&#x27;s clumsy arrival. Next the violins tentatively introduce the first waltz, followed by another given out by the solo violin, before the whole orchestra settles into waltz mode. A general pause and a violin solo leads into the nostalgic music where the Marschallin sadly realises she has lost Octavian. Then comes its ecstatic climax. The work closes with a singularly robust waltz, depicting Ochs at his most pompous, and a boisterous coda newly composed for the suite.

==Language==
Hofmannsthal&#x27;s libretto uses various forms of the German language. Members of the nobility speak in a refined and courteous mode, appropriate to the opera&#x27;s 1740s setting. In more intimate circles they use a more familiar style of speech (). For instance, the conversations between Octavian and the Marschallin in the first act use the familiar &quot;you&quot; but switch back and forth between more formal speech (&quot;&quot;) and the familiar &quot;du&quot;, as well as the intermediate (and now obsolete) &quot;&quot;.

Some productions include a glossary in the programme to help clarify the contextual meaning of the language used, which is mostly lost in translation. Ochs makes clumsy, mannered attempts at refined or flamboyant language, using non-German words and phrases such as (&quot;by Bacchus&#x27;s body!&quot; in Italian), some of which he mispronounces. The language used by Octavian as Mariandel, and by other non-noble characters, is an Austrian dialect whose connotations are difficult for non-native speakers to grasp. The German used by the Italians, Valzacchi and Annina, is also very broken and marked by Italian accentuations. Strauss and Hofmannsthal used dialects to depict the social status of a role in a similar way in their next opera, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;.

In English translations, these dialects have been accounted for with varying degrees of rigor; the Chandos Highlights version, for example, uses only standard British English.

==Grainger&#x27;s &quot;Ramble&quot;==
Percy Grainger wrote an elaborate and complex piano transcription of a theme from &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;. The &quot;Ramble on the Last Love Duet in Der Rosenkavalier&quot; is one of his more complex piano transcriptions, with many sumptuous ornamentations and harmonic twists and turns.

<text>Arthur George Bottomley, Baron Bottomley, (7 February 1907 – 3 November 1995) was a British Labour Party politician, Member of Parliament and minister.

==Early life==
Before entering parliament he was a trade union organiser of the National Union of Public Employees (which later became part of UNISON). From 1929 to 1949 he was a councillor on Walthamstow Borough Council, and in 1945–1946 he was Mayor of Walthamstow. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1941 Birthday Honours.

==Parliamentary career==
Bottomley was first elected to parliament in the 1945 general election for the Chatham division of Rochester and he held the seat (later renamed Rochester and Chatham) until losing it in the 1959 general election to the Conservative Julian Critchley. He returned to parliament by winning Middlesbrough East in a 1962 by-election and held the seat, and its successor Middlesbrough, until his retirement in 1983.

Bottomley was a junior minister in Clement Attlee&#x27;s governments, being Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (1946–47), Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (1947) and Secretary for Overseas Trade at the Board of Trade (1947–51). In Harold Wilson&#x27;s governments he was Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (1964–66) — during which time he sought to deal with the consequences of Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence — and Minister of Overseas Development (1966–67).

Announced in the 1984 New Year Honours, he was created a life peer as Baron Bottomley of Middlesbrough in the County of Cleveland, on 31 January 1984.

Lord Bottomley died on 3 November 1995 at the age of 88.

==Family==
His wife, Bessie Ellen Bottomley (&quot;née&quot; Wiles), JP, whom he married in 1936, was named a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1970 &quot;[f]or public and social services.&quot;

Bessie Ellen Bottomley died in 1998 in Redbridge, Essex.

Today, the system consists of three lines and 52 stations, located throughout Kyiv&#x27;s ten raion (districts), and operates of routes, with used for revenue service and for non-revenue service. At below ground level, Arsenalna station on the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line is the second deepest metro station in the world after Hongyancun station in Chongqing.

In 2016, annual ridership for the metro was 484.56 million passengers, or about 1.32 million passengers daily. The metro accounted for 46.7% of Kyiv&#x27;s public transport load in 2014.

== Beginnings (1884-1920) ==
The first idea for an underground railway appeared in 1884. The project, which was given for analysis to the city council by the director of the Southwestern railways, Dmytro Andrievskiy, planned to create tunnels from Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station. The tunnel was expected to start near Poshtova square and finish near Bessarabka. A new railway station was to be built there, while the old railway station was to be converted into a freight railway station. The project was long discussed but eventually turned down by the city council.

Kyiv was a pioneering city for Imperial Russian rapid transit, opening the first Russian tram system. In September 1916, businessmen of the Russo-American trading corporation attempted to collect funds to sponsor the construction of a metro in Kyiv. As a reason to construct it, the trading corporation wrote:
Despite the arguments, the project was not accepted by the city council, again.

After the downfall of the Tsarist government, Hetman Skoropadsky was also interested in the building of a metro system, somewhere near the district of Zvirynets, where the government center was planned to be built. As one of the members of his cabinet argued:

However, the project lost its support after the downfall of the Hetmanate in the autumn of 1918 and the change of the Ukrainian government towards the Directorate. Then, in 1919–1920, during the Russian Civil War (in which Ukraine was involved), the project was shelved for good.

Following the Bolsheviks&#x27; victory in the Russian Civil War, Kyiv became only a provincial city, and no large-scale proposals to improve the city were made.

== Initial promotion ==
In 1934, the capital of the Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv. On July 9, 1936, the Presidium of the Kyiv City Council assessed the diploma project by Papazov (Papazian), an Armenian graduate of the Moscow University of Transport Engineering, called, &quot;The Project of the Kyiv Metro.&quot; The meeting minutes stated that &quot;the author successfully resolved one of the problems of reconstruction of the city of Kyiv and establishment of intra-city transportation and also answered various practical questions about the Metro plan (the routes of the underground, the position of stations).&quot; The engineer Papazov (Papazian) received a bonus of 1,000 Soviet rubles for this project from the City of Kyiv. However, it is unknown if his proposals were taken into account in the plan. A few days before, on July 5, the Kyiv newspaper &quot;Bil&#x27;shovyk&quot; published an article that featured a project of underground, prepared by engineers from the Transport Devices Institute in Ukraine&#x27;s Soviet Socialist Republic&#x27;s Academy of Sciences. The project promised to drill three lines of a subway approximately long.

Rumors started spreading that the construction of the Metro would begin soon. At first, the city council denied these rumors, amid letters from the specialists in the drilling and mining sectors offering their services. But in 1938, officials started preparatory work. However, this stopped abruptly in 1941 with the start of the Great Patriotic War (World War II). By the end of the war, Kyiv was destroyed. Being the third largest city in the USSR, a massive reconstruction process was ordered. This time, the Metro was taken into account.

Work continued in 1944, after Kyiv&#x27;s liberation. On 5 August 1944, a resolution from the Soviet Union&#x27;s Government was proclaimed. The resolution planned for underground construction, thus the government ordered the appropriate organizations to continue preparatory works, create a technical project, and estimate total costs. To finance this initial work, the USSR&#x27;s National Commissariat of Finances allocated 1 million Soviet rubles from the Reserve Fund of the USSR&#x27;s government. On 22 February 1945, another resolution was proclaimed, which definitively ordered the underground to be constructed.

To determine where the underground construction was most suitable, experts from the Kyiv Office of Metrogiprotrans analyzed the flow of passengers in the streets of Kyiv, both in the city center and in the outskirts. The analysis revealed three suitable directions to construct the underground: Sviatoshyn–Brovary, Kurenivka–Demiyivka, and Syrets–Pechersk. The former two were chosen to be built. It was decided that the first section of underground openings along these two directions— in length—would be constructed by 1950.

This plan, however, did not come to life. The final preparations were not conducted until 1949. By the decision of the Ministry of Communication, the Kyivmetrobud enterprise was established on 14 April. Only then did the underground construction finally begin.

==History==
=== First phase ===
Construction planning of the first line (M1) of the Kyiv Metro began in August 1949. The initial plan had seven stations, and a project design competition for the stations was announced in 1952. The competition commission wanted all seven stations to have a Stalinist style: richly decorated and adorned with Communist symbols and national (Ukrainian) motifs. However, the competition was cancelled, partly due to the cancellation of the two westernmost stations and partly due to Khrushchev Thaw, which made the Stalinist style inappropriate.

Tunnel drilling is frequently met with unanticipated difficulties—such as unexpected drilling terrain and underground water sources—causing the construction to fall severely behind schedule. In December 1951, the first connection between separate tunnels was made between Dnipro and Arsenalna stations, while the last was created between the Vokzalna and Universytet stations, in May 1959.

Various difficulties arose during the construction of the underground. For example, Arsenalna station was constantly flooded by underground waters despite its exceptional depth, which was originally intended to prevent flooding. Moreover, the project came to a standstill in 1954 when funding was instead allocated to the development of unused land fit for agriculture. Nevertheless, work progressed.At the beginning of 1958, a competition for the best design of stations was announced. A commission analyzing the works was created, consisting of activists, engineering and architecture experts from both the Ukrainian SSR and the USSR, sculptors, artists, writers, and the heads of the organizations Glavtunelstroy, Metrogiprotrans, and Kyivmetrobud. In July, an exhibition of 80 works was organized. The best five designs were used for the first five stations of the Kyiv Metro: Vokzalna, Universytet, Khreshchatyk, Arsenalna, and Dnipro.

During this construction, of concrete was poured, and of granite and marble were used to decorate the stations.

On 22 October 1960, a test run was made by Alexey Semagin, a motorman of the Moscow Metro, and Ivan Vynogradov, the former train operator from the central railway station of Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi. Semagin drove, with Vynogradov acting as an assistant.

On 6 November 1960, the anniversary of the October Revolution, the five-station, Vokzalna–Dnipro portion of the east–west line (today known as the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line) was opened. That day, the motormen changed their places, and thus Ivan Vynogragov has now been deemed the first motorman of the Kyiv Metro.

=== Opening and aftermath ===
The underground was not available to the public the same day the line was declared open. During the first week, special passes had to be shown to ride the newly opened section. True public service only started on 13 November. At the time, the stations had no turnstiles; the tickets were shown to the inspector.

Immediately after the Kyiv Metro&#x27;s opening, the need for a train depot became a problem. It was not feasible to construct a permanent on-ground depot as the stations were deep underground. Yet the creation of an underground depot was costly. At first, it was solved by creating a temporary depot next to Dnipro station, where Kyivmetrobud had its headquarters at the time. There were some warehouses constructed as well so that necessary items could be substituted if needed. Unfortunately, this temporary depot was not connected to the main underground line. To move trains to the depot, an overhead crane was used.

Simultaneously, another logistics problem appeared: there was no connection between the underground and the railway. At the time, the metro line was served by type Д underground trains (produced by Metrowagonmash). To deliver them to the underground, the trains had to be placed on a special carriage at Darnytsia railway station. The carriage was then transported by trams (via the now non-existing tram line along the Dnieper river) to the temporary depot, where the trains were then lifted onto the railway turntable. Since the procedure was uncomfortable and tedious, most trains rested overnight in the tunnels and arrived at the depot only to be checked for repairs and repaired.

At the time, the Kyiv Metro was under the jurisdiction of the USSR&#x27;s Ministry of Communication, and not of Kyiv&#x27;s city council. Until 1962, the motormen were mostly from Moscow, as no institution provided appropriate education in Ukraine. Some Kyiv railway engineers were employed (such as Vynogragov), but they had to qualify for motormen in Moscow.

=== Extension of the first line ===
The second stage of construction of the first line started in 1960, and finished on 5 November 1963, with the opening of a section with two stations: Politekhnichnyi Instytut and Zavod Bilshovyk (now Shuliavska station). A year later, new type E underground trains were introduced.
In 1965, the line crossed the Dnieper river on the newly constructed Kyiv Metro Bridge and Rusanivskyi Metropolitan Bridge and was extended to the large residential areas being built along the east bank of the river. Like the Dnipro station, Hidropark, Livoberezhna, and Darnytsia stations all were built on-ground. Additionally, to resolve the question of a temporary depot, a permanent depot (Darnytsia Metro Depot) was built between Livoberezhna and Darnytsia stations; importantly, it had access to Kyiv-Dniprovskyi railway station. New trains could now be easily transported immediately into the depot, which, having a connection with the metro line, could also easily host trains.

A few developments were made to the old stations. Since Khreshchatyk station was opened with only one exit, a second one was built and opened on 4 September 1965. A third exit was finished in May 1970. While being modernized, the station was lengthened by 40 meters.

Further extension of the first line to the east was made in 1968, when Komsomolska station (now Chernihivska station) was opened, along with another facility where the trains could be repaired.

When it was discovered that Leningrad&#x27;s Metro E-type underground trains were not suitable for the platform screen doors of new stations under construction, they were delivered to Kyiv in 1969; meanwhile, Kyiv&#x27;s older D-type trains, which did not have any problems with these new stations, were transported to Leningrad.

In 1970, an additional carriage was added to every train, for a total of four. A fifth was added two years later. Since 1972, the number of carriages has remained constant (as of 4 July 2017).

On 5 November 1971, Kyiv&#x27;s then-westernmost neighborhoods were connected to the underground. Three new stations were opened: Zhovtneva (now Beresteiska), Nyvky, and Sviatoshyno (now with the &quot;o&quot; removed). Thus, the underground was extended to 14 stations and a length of .

On 23 August 1972, the billionth passenger of the Kyiv underground entered the Arsenalna station. The worker of the &quot;Arsenal&quot; factory was given a yearly ticket in the underground as a present on such an occasion.

Finally, in 1973–1974, another modernization of the underground was made, the third to the rolling stock. New type Eм underground trains from Leningrad&#x27;s train building facility were delivered to Kyiv.

Further extensions on this line occurred in 1978 (with Pionerska station, now Lisova) and 2003 (with Zhytomyrska and Akademmistechko stations).

=== Second line ===
Construction of the second line (M2) began in 1971. The line became known as &quot;Kurenivsko-Chervonoarmiyska&quot;; however, the name did not completely correspond to the actual route, as it does not pass via Kurenivka. In mid-1960, when plans for the line were made, the construction was expected to go towards Kurenivka and Priorka, connecting Zavodska station (instead of today&#x27;s Tarasa Shevchenka), Petropavlivska station near Kurenivskyi park, and Shevhenka Square station under the square. However, as the decision to create the Obolon residential district was made, these plans changed.

The new line was constructed in the open and its stations were not constructed deep underground. Because of this, historical buildings were demolished in the Podil neighborhood. During construction, archaeologists discovered a house dated from Kyivs&#x27;ka Rus&#x27; (879–1240) under the Red Square (now Kontraktova Square). The discovery helped historians understand the life of Podil inhabitants in the Middle Ages at a much more profound scale. This archaeological research was one of the reasons the underground construction was suspended, which is why the small stretch was opened only on 17 December 1976. It contained three stations: Kalinina Square (later renamed to Ploshcha Zhovtnevoi Revolutsii () on 17 October 1977 for the upcoming 60th anniversary of the October Revolution; now Maidan Nezalezhnosti), Poshtova Ploshcha, and Chervona Ploshcha. Additionally, there was a repair facility near Chervona Ploshcha and a transfer corridor to the older (M1) line, separate for trains and passengers. This corridor allowed the exchange of rolling stock, and more importantly, allowed trains on the new line to access the Darnytsia depot until a new one appeared in 1988.

Simultaneously, an extension on the first line was made eastward. In 1978, Pionerska station was opened, which might have been the next step towards the realization of Stalin times projects (the line was planned to be extended to Brovary, the satellite town of Kyiv). Nevertheless, construction on the first line came to a halt, and, as of 4 July 2017, there were no plans yet to extend the line eastwards beyond Lisova station, so construction efforts were shifted to the second line.

The second line—which became known as the Kurenivsko-Chervonoarmiyska line (today the Obolonsko–Teremkivska line)—continued expanding. On 19 December 1980, three new stations—Tarasa Shevchenka, Petrivka (now Pochaina station), and Prospekt Korniychuka (now Obolon station)—were opened on the northern part of the line. After another two years, the Minska and Heroiv Dnipra stations were added to the second line, on the 55th anniversary of the October Revolution. This connected the then-largest residential district of Kyiv to the rapid transit network.

Construction did not stop at the southern end of the line. Ploshcha Lva Tolstoho and Respublikanskyi Stadion (now Olimpiiska station) were opened on 19 December 1981, followed by Chervonoarmiiska (now Palats &quot;Ukrayina&quot; station) and Dzerzhynska (now Lybidska station) on 30 December 1984. Construction then started to the southwest of the newly opened terminus but was soon interrupted by an accident while workers were drilling through the difficult terrain under the Lybid river. Further work only continued 21 years later, in the summer of 2005.

=== Infrastructure development ===
In 1980, while the construction of the M2 line was at its height, the new rolling stock from Metrowagonmash (81-717/714) started to be used.

In 1985, a new train repair plant was built, first called ОМ-2. Additionally, once it appeared that the corridor between October Revolution Square and Khreshchatyk was not able to cope with the stream of passengers, a second corridor was built (informally called the &quot;long&quot; corridor), opening on 3 December 1986. The same year, disambiguation to the Darnytsia depot was made (three tracks were made, of which two are for passenger traffic, while the third was supposed to let the trains exit the depot).

On 30 December 1987, the second (eastern) exit from the Hydropark station was built and opened only in summer.

Lastly, on 19 March 1988, a new depot (called the Obolon Depot) was created to serve the M2 line.

=== Third line ===
====Soviet period====

The first event connected with the construction of the third line (M3) was the creation of a new tunnel on the M1 line between the Vokzalna and Khreshchatyk stations. In the middle of it, a new station, Leninska, was to arise, specially designed as a transfer hub to the future M3 line. When the new tunnel was ready to be connected to the rest of the line, service in the old M1 tunnel between Vokzalna and Khreshchatyk was interrupted from 31 March to 1 October 1987. During this time, two shuttle trains carried passengers from Vokzalna to Universytet stations, and the tunnel between Universytet and Khreshchatyk was closed. To manage passengers, additional temporary lines of buses and trolleybuses were created. The Leninska station itself was inaugurated on the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution, on 6 November 1987, and is now known as Teatralna station.

The older tunnels, over each, partially cut by the ceiling of the Zoloti Vorota station, still exist and are now accessible only for maintenance by staff.

Construction of the third line (called the Syretsko-Pecherska Line, the northwest–southeast axis) started in 1981. The initial segment was finished on 31 December 1989 and featured three stations: Zoloti Vorota, Palats Sportu, and Mechnikova (now Klovska). The first two were transfer hubs to other lines; the third was the start of a technical tunnel between lines M2 and M3, which allowed trains from the M3 line to use the Obolon depot on the M2 line. Until 30 April 1990, the exit from Zoloti Vorota station (the then-northern terminus of M3) was only possible via Leninska station. An exit from Zoloti Vorota onto Volodymyrska Street was only opened on 1 May 1990.

A total of 31 stations and of passenger tunnels were constructed during the first 31 years of the subway system in the Ukrainian SSR.

==== Post-independence====
Despite severe economic problems at the dawn of Ukrainian independence, momentum on the Kyiv Metro construction was not lost. On 30 December 1991, Druzhby Narodiv and Vydubychi stations were opened (Pecherska station was opened six years later, on 27 December 1997, since its construction had to be frozen due to hydrotechnical problems). In 1992, the line crossed the Dnieper river to Slavutych and Osokorky stations via the Pivdennyi Bridge. Initially, this bridge (which was open from the sides) was intended to be covered by an aluminium construction, but this was found to be ineffective protection against snow and rain.

While the construction of the bridge segment was in progress, Telychka station was also under construction. However, due to factory closures in the surrounding heavily industrialized area, the station construction site was abandoned. What remains of it now is a platform and a ventilation shaft, so the station can be used in emergency cases (e.g. a fire or train breakdown).

Two years later (on 28 December 1994), the M3 line was further extended to the east, when Pozniaky and Kharkivska stations were revealed to the public. Pozniaky station was the first distinctly three-floor underground station in Kyiv; the lower floor was used by the underground, while the middle and the top floors were used by small market stalls. This structure later enabled the station to easily become a transfer hub for the upcoming Livoberezhna line (M5) by replacing the stalls with passenger transfer areas. The opening of these stations was crucial for the rapidly developing Poznyaky and Kharkivskyi residential districts.

In the mid-1990s, construction of a northwestern expansion to the older Syrets district began, with the first extension made on 30 December 1996. Then, Lukianivska station became the new terminus of the line. Lvivska Brama station was also built (between Zoloti Vorota and Lukianivska), but its construction came to a halt in 1997 due to a lack of money and disagreement on how Lvivska Square should be reconstructed.

On 30 March 2000, the next station on the line, Dorohozhychi, was opened. Another station, Hertsena station (situated between Lukianivska and Dorohozhychi stations), was also planned—even potentially under initial construction—but ultimately abandoned. Neither the current official scheme (see below) nor the earlier one indicates this station.

Four years later, on 14 October 2004, the M3 line was further extended to the northwest, ending at Syrets station (still the current terminus of the line).

At the same time, works were done on the southeastern stretch of the line, with Boryspilska station opening on 23 August 2005 and Vyrlytsia opening on 7 March 2006. At first, Vyrlytsia was only an emergency exit, and the station was not planned to be built. However, the City Council later decided, in November 2005, to convert the exit into a full station, which is the reason why this station has side platforms.

On 23 August 2007, the third and newest depot in the Kyiv Metro—Kharkivske Depot—was opened.

In September 2005, construction began on Chervonyi Khutir station, the last station on the M3 line. In April 2007, the Mayor of Kyiv, Leonid Chernovetskyi, fearing the station will have low ridership, claimed the station would be subject to conservation, as &quot;animals do not ride in the underground&quot; (he meant that the station was situated near the forest, with not many buildings nearby, so there were no people to use the station). Nevertheless, the works continued, and, after a few months&#x27; delay, the station opened on 23 May 2008, for the Kyiv Day celebration. The timing coincided with the upcoming mayoral elections on 25 May 2008. This station had the second-lowest ridership in the Kyiv Metro as of 2017.

=== The latest phase (1991–2013) ===

Until the 2000s, the M1 line terminated at Sviatoshyn station (renamed in 1993 from Sviatoshyno station) at the western end. However, new apartments had emerged since 1971, mostly in Bilychi and western Sviatoshyn, which created a need for an extension of the line to the housing facilities.

Construction of the final section of today&#x27;s M1 line started in the fall of 2000. Zhytomyrska station and Akademmistechko station were built, with delays due to irregular financing. Peremohy Avenue was partially closed from 14 January 2001 to 25 December 2002, to construct the tunnels beneath the street. This final extension of the M1 line was opened on 24 May 2003.

Construction of the southwestern segment of the M2 line restarted in the summer of 2005, 21 years after the Lybid river accident. Difficult terrain made the work fall behind the schedule, partly due to accidents (such as one in January 2006 during the construction of the Demiivska station). On 15 December 2010, Demiivska, Holosiivska, and Vasylkivska stations were opened.

The 50th station, Vystavkovyi Tsentr, was unveiled a year later, on 27 December 2011. Ipodrom followed suit on 25 October 2012. Initially, Ipodrom was planned to be opened together with Teremky station in November 2012, but, with the lack of financing and lagging behind the schedule, only Ipodrom was opened by then (ahead of schedule, partly thanks to funds reallocation, and partly because of the 2012 parliamentary elections due for 28 October). The Ipodrom–Teremky section would wait for underground construction funds until 2013. As there was no turnaround option for trains there, a shuttle train drove between Vystavkovyi Tsentr and Ipodrom stations until Teremky station was opened on 6 November 2013, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Kyiv&#x27;s liberation. As of 2025, this was the last extension or opening of any underground-connected facility (not taking into account the opening of the second exit from Osokorky station, which was built together with the station but opened only in 2014).

=== The 2022 Russian invasion ===

During the 2022 Russian invasion on 24 February, regular service on the metro was suspended. A reduced schedule was adopted with limited services running between 8:00 and 19:00. All underground stations (47 of the 52 total) have remained open 24 hours a day to function as bomb shelters.

In the wake of air raid missile attacks, metro stations have been often used as bomb shelters. According to Kyiv&#x27;s mayor Vitali Klitschko, on 2 March 2022, as many as 150,000 residents of Kyiv sought shelter in the city&#x27;s metro.

=== Metro tunnels flooding in 2023 ===
The expansion of the second line to the Teremky neighborhood faced the problems since the beginning of its construction, originally the Demiivska station was planned to be opened in 2009 but the opening had to be postponed until 2010 after in 2006, one year after the construction started, the retaining wall collapsed with gantry crane damaging city communications. Later, in 2008 the tunneling shield got stuck several times during tunnel construction. By 2009 there were five fatalities in various accidents occurred at the line&#x27;s construction.

8 December 2023, years after the controversial construction was finished, Kyiv City Council informed that the tunnel of the second line between Lybidska and Demiivska stations has been depressurized and the rails are flooded. Because of this accident the rest of the line which led to Teremky had to be closed, it caused serious transportation problems since that metro line was the main mode of transport in that part of the city.

The next day after the announcement similar problems have been discovered on the other end of the line at the Pochaina station which was built in 1980.

On 9 December, Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal gathered an emergency meeting of the State Commission on Emergency Situations regarding the accident. Police initiated searches of the engineering organisation responsible for the tunnels, administration of Kyiv Metro and Kyiv City Council, obtaining the construction documents for the investigation of the negligence case.

On 13 December, the so-called &#x27;shuttle traffic&#x27; began to operate, so the second line was split in two separate parts with a tunnel reconstruction site between them, buses had been launched to replace the full line.

On 17 December, the buildings of an abandoned Demiivskyi market which was located at the top of the damaged tunnel began to subside.

On 18 December, the administration of Kyiv Metro announced that the repair works between Tarasa Shevchenka and Pochaina stations will start in the summer of 2024 but they won&#x27;t need the train movement to be stopped.

Kyivpastrans announced compensation for e-tickets spent on transfer between &#x27;shuttle traffic&#x27;.

On 24 January 2024, Kyiv Department of Transport Infrastructure announced that by the results of the expertise the cause of the accident was a bad quality of the project and construction work.

On 11 September 2024, the reconstruction of the tunnel was announced to be complete, and the Obolonsko–Teremkivska line continued operating as normal starting from the next day.

== Modernization ==

=== Rolling stock===
In the 1990s, the Kyiv Metro authority was mostly concerned with new underground construction, rather than old infrastructure modernization. This changed in March 2001, when an experimental modification of 81-717/714 trains, the Slavutych 81-553.1/554.1/555.1 wagon, was launched from Obolon depot. It included an increased number of electronic devices and induction motors (instead of synchronous motors in earlier series). The train model, however, was not released into mass production, so the test train remained the only one from its series. This experimental 81-553.1 train is still operated on the Obolonsko–Teremkivska line between 7-10 a.m. on weekdays.

The modification of 81-717/714 (81-717.5М/714.5М) trains arrived three years later at the Darnytsia depot.

Another modification of the 81-717/714 series, the , made by the Kryukiv wagon-manufacturing plant (KVBZ), would be the first underground train made in Ukraine in the Kyiv Metro. This new model was first unveiled to the then-President of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, at the opening of the Boryspilska station. Five months later, a sample was sent to the Darnytsia depot for trials, where an error was detected. Further tests were conducted from 17 June 2006 in the Obolon depot. Finally, in July 2008, the trains were accepted by the governmental commission and were given a special license allowing them to be mass-produced (following Ukrainian technical standards). They started carrying passengers in 2009. 81-7021–7022 trains were supposed to substitute the older 81-717/714 trains, but, as of 5 July 2017, there was only one train of such a model.

The next modified trains, 81-540.2К/81-714.5М, made by Wagonmash (St. Peterburg) and Metrowagonmash, are another modification of 81-717/714, arrived in 2010, with additional trains set on rails in 2013.

Finally, in 2014–2016, new 81-7080 trains were transported from KVBZ to the Kyiv Metro, which is now actively used on the M1 line.

In 2023, Warsaw Metro donated 60 cars of its decommissioned 81-717/714 series trains to Kyiv Metro. They will be used as parts donors to overhaul the existing rolling stock or enter passenger service to strengthen the current fleet. The first set entered service on the M3 Line on 1 November 2023.

=== Stations ===
In October 2005, new escalators were installed in Lisova and Syrets stations, as a movement for modernization in the former case, and the latter as part of a pylon station&#x27;s equipment.

The following year, Darnytsia station was modernized, and a second exit (towards Popudrenka Street) was built.

In March–May 2017, a ₴24.84 million hryvnias (US$915,900) refurbishment of Livoberezhna station was made due to the second Eurovision session in Kyiv.

==Infrastructure==

===Network map===
=== Lines ===
As of 2019, 3 lines are operational, with a total length of . The additional that appear in the table account for technical tunnels, used by trains to switch from one line to another.
The lines&#x27; names are derived from the terminal stations proposed in the original 1945 construction plan, which is why the M1 line is called &quot;Sviatoshynsko–Brovarska&quot;, despite finishing 11 kilometers short of Brovary&#x27;s city center (the official Metro site says &quot;the extension to Brovary is possible in far future&quot;). Similarly, the M2 line&#x27;s route does not pass through Kurenivka. In February 2018, the Kyiv City Council renamed the M2 line from &quot;Kurenivsko–Chervonoarmiyska&quot; to &quot;Obolonsko–Teremkivska&quot;.

Colloquially, lines are rarely referred to by their full names, but rather by their numbers or colors (e.g. the &quot;Syretsko–Pecherska line&quot; is usually referred to as &quot;The Third line&quot; or &quot;The Green line&quot;).

====Line 1 (Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska)====
The Sviatoshynsko–Brovarska line is the first line of the Kyiv Metro, with a length of . All of its stations on the eastern bank of the Dnieper river are either at or above ground level, this is attributed to a similar experiment to Moscow&#x27;s Filyovskaya Line. The milder Ukrainian climate, however, prevented these stations from severely deteriorating, which was why extensions in 1968 and 1979 were kept from going underground. The five original stations on this line managed to survive Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s struggle with decorative &quot;extras&quot;, although more pompous projects were proposed in Stalin&#x27;s time. These five stations are recognized as architectural monuments and thus are protected by the state. The M1 line is colored red on maps and carries about 550,000 passengers daily, making it the busiest line.

====Line 2 (Obolonsko–Teremkivska)====
The Obolonsko–Teremkivska line was the second line of the Kyiv Metro, with a length of . Initially, it extends southwards along the right bank of the Dnieper river but deviates from the river towards the southwest beyond Lybidska station. Most of this line&#x27;s stations were built in the 1970s and 1980s. Architecturally, the line shows some of the best examples of late-Soviet architectural features (with Lybidska station being an architectural monument protected by the state). The line&#x27;s newest stations, built-in 2010–2013, are a good example of modern stations with national decoration motifs (such as at Teremky station) and have access for disabled persons. The M2 line is colored blue on maps and carries more than 460,000 passengers daily.

====Line 3 (Syretsko-Pecherska)====
The Syretsko-Pecherska Line is the third and longest line in the Kyiv Metro, with a length of . It is a major northwest–southeast axis of the Kyiv rapid transit system. It starts on the western side of the Dnieper river before crossing it on a partially covered bridge and then going on to the southeastern residential districts of Kyiv. The line is the newest and shows some post-independence decorative motifs. Technically, it is also a great development, with most of the platforms longer and wider than older sections and with some stations having access for disabled persons. The Vydubychi–Slavutych tunnel is the longest in the Kyiv Metro, as separates the two stations. This is partial because several stations were not completed—two stations had construction suspended (and never finished) while another station was only planned. The M3 line is colored green on maps and carries more than 300,000 passengers daily.

=== Stations ===

The Kyiv Metro follows a standard Soviet design: a triangular layout of three lines that intersect in the city center, making six radii, and stations that are built very deep underground and could potentially double as bomb shelters.

==== Technical data ====

Currently, there are 52 stations. There are 20 deep-lying stations, of which 17 are of pylon type (including Arsenalna station, the only &quot;London style&quot; station in the former USSR still in existence) and 3 are of column type. Of the 26 sub-surface stations, 13 stations are of pillar-trispan type, 3 are side-platform pillar bi-spans, 8 are single-vaults, and 3 are asymmetrical double-deck bi-spans. In addition, 6 stations are located above ground; of these, four are surface level and two are flyover. Most of the stations have large vestibules, some on the surface level whilst others are underground and interlinked via subways. Access for disabled persons, previously overlooked, has become an important issue, and all new stations have been constructed with the necessary provisions.

Arsenalna station is distinguished as the deepest station in the world, at 105.5 m below ground (considering the distance between the surface above the station and the station itself). Dnipro, the next station proceeding towards Dnieper, is overground, which gives the Dnipro–Arsenalna tunnel the largest elevation difference between metro stations in the world, considering the surface&#x27;s relative height.

There are three unfinished stations: Lvivska Brama, Telychka, and Hertsena, all of which are on the green M3 line. Hertsena had only the initial stages of construction completed, while the former two are more advanced in construction (about 30–70% completed) but lack conventional exits.

Kyiv Metro is poorly adapted for handicapped persons. Only stations constructed after 2005 are better adapted for handicapped people; for example, they have elevators and turnstiles wide enough for a wheelchair to pass.

====Architecture====

Like all the Metro systems of the former Soviet Union, the Kyiv Metro is known for its vivid and colorful decorations. The original stations from the first stage of construction are elaborately decorated, showing the postwar Stalinist architecture blended with traditional Ukrainian motifs. Many first projects for stations offered at the beginning of the 1950s were full of rich decorative elements such as mosaics, ornaments, bas-reliefs, sculptures, and marble.

Each station was to have its original shape. These stations were to be constructed in a monumental style like those stations built throughout the 1950s in Moscow and Leningrad. For example, Arsenalna station, instead of a small central hall, should have had a wide hall with sculptures of warriors of the Russian Civil War and World War II; Vokzalna station was to be decorated with ornaments and bas-reliefs on columns and a big decorative map of the Ukrainian SSR; and, based on its first project drawings, Politeckhnichniy Institut station was to have large mosaic panels depicting aspects of the natural sciences.
By the end of the 1950s, a period of functionality and struggle against architectural extravagances had begun in Soviet architecture. This action, propagated by Khrushchev, resulted in the loss of many unique projects, with the resulting stations being finished with few decorations, compared to the 1952 projects. Universytet station, however, was less simplified than many others and retained its many pylons adorned with the busts of famous scientists and writers. The next stations which opened in 1963 had an ascetic and strict appearance. Open-air stations of the 1960s and the underground stations of 1971 were built to a standard primitive design called &quot;sorokonozhka&quot; (), named for the many thin supports on both sides of the platform. Functionality became the most important factor in newer designs, and stations built at that time were almost identical in appearance, save the design of tile patterns and pillar covering material. Only in the 1970s did decorative architecture start to make a recovery. The stations built from the 1980s onwards show more innovative designs.

Some older stations have undergone upgrades to lighting and renovation of some decorative materials. After the declaration of Ukrainian independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the Soviet symbols originally incorporated into decor were adapted to modern times or removed altogether by altering the station&#x27;s architecture. Most remaining (if not all) Soviet symbols were later removed due to 2015 decommunization laws.

==== Passenger flow ====

As of 2015, Lisova was the busiest station in the Kyiv Metro, passing an average of 58,500 passengers per day, with Vokzalna following second with 55,900. The congestion at Vokzalna station, especially during rush hours, is particularly problematic due to the station having only 3 escalators and only one access point for entering and exiting the station. Akademmistechko is third at 51,100. These are the only stations that handle more than 50,000 passengers per day. The next busiest, Livoberezhna, passes 48,100 passengers per day. All four of these busiest stations are on the red M1 line.

The fifth busiest station is Pochaina with 46,200 passengers per day (on the blue M2 line), with Minska not far behind at 45,500. On the Syretsko-Pecherska line, the busiest station is Lukianivska, with just under 40,000.

In contrast, the least busy station in the system is the Dnipro station (M1), with only 2,800 passengers per day. Chervonyi Khutir (M3) is another station with a daily passenger flow of less than 5,000. The emptiest station on the M2 line is Poshtova Ploshcha, with 8,900 passengers per day.

==== Transfer hubs to other lines and other means of rapid transit ====
Vokzalna station is one of the most important transport hubs in the Kyiv Metro. It gives direct access to the Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station, the largest train station in Ukraine, as well as to the Kyiv Light Rail line to Borshchahivka and the Kyiv Urban Electric Train ring.

Additional important transport hubs include Demiivska station (to the Kyiv Central bus station); Vystavkovyi Tsentr and Lisova stations (mostly to suburban buses, but to the Pivdenna and Darnytsia bus stations as well, respectively); and Livoberezhna, Darnytsia, and Pochaina stations, used by commuting passengers from Troieshchyna (the largest residential district in Kyiv).

==== Distribution of stations across the city ====
Metro stations cover all 10 subdivisions of Kyiv; however, their spread is uneven. Shevchenkivskyi district has the most, at 13 stations; Pecherskyi and Holosiivskyi &quot;raions&quot; both boast 11 stops; Darnytskyi district has 7; Obolonskyi, Sviatoshynskyi, and Dniprovskyi districts each feature 4; Podilskyi district offers 3; and Desnyanskyi &quot;raion&quot;, despite being the most populous district in Kyiv, is relatively deprived of Metro connections, with only 2 stations.

This distribution reveals that the western side of Kyiv contains the majority of stations (including the M2 line, which does not cross to the eastern side of the Dnieper). Only 12 stations reside in the eastern part of the city, compared to 40 on the western side.

=== Rolling stock ===

As of 2016, there were 824 wagons in operation, with another 5 spares. Most of the wagons are from the Soviet era, largely from the 81-717/714 series and some trains from the older D-type and E-type series. The stock, however, is refreshed. The &quot;Slavutych&quot; trains began to replace the old trains of predominantly 81/7021-7022, 81-540.2К/81-714.5М, and 81–7080 series. The metro&#x27;s first line was served by carriages of D-type since its opening. In 1969, all these carriages were given to Saint Petersburg Metro. In exchange, the line received carriages of series E-type, and later carriages of series Em-501, Ema-502, and Ezh (Ezh1). In 2014, most carriages of types E and Ezh were modernized with new engines, interiors, and exteriors, converting them into a type similar to type 81-7021–7022; these are known as type 81-7080–7081 or E-KM.

All of the trains contain an audio system, which announces the stations and transfer opportunities to other Metro lines. At Arsenalna station, there is an announcement for museums in the area. In addition, most of the older trains are fitted with an overhead video information system, which provides visual information to passengers regarding the current and the next stations and transfer opportunities between lines. While the train is in transit between stations, the system displays advertising (both in video and ticker forms), recreational video content, and local time.

Kyiv Metro also has some special service trains, namely:
* 2 trains checking the electrical system of the Kyiv Metro, which were conventional D-type and E-type trains before conversion
* A D-type car that measures tracks&#x27; length
* Laboratory car based on an Ezh-type train
* An E-type freight car
* A track repair vehicle
In December 2016, the Kyiv City Council announced that intended to buy 709 new trains by 2025 for ₴14.96 billion (US$572.6 million at the time). Of these, 276 would replace older trains whose operation terms have expired, 62 would be added to the Syretsko-Pecherska line to ensure regular scheduling, and 371 would be introduced across newer sections of the metro system.

After a visit of the Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko to Warsaw in January 2023, he informed that Warsaw will donate 60 81-717/713 wagons to the Kyiv Metro.

===Management===
The Kyiv Metro is managed by the city-owned municipal company &quot;Kyivskyi Metropoliten&quot; (formally formerly known as &quot;Kyivskyi ordena Trudovoho chernovoho prapora Metropoliten imeni V.I. Lenina&quot;) which was transferred in the early 1990s from the Ministry of Transportation. The Metro employs several thousand workers in tunnel, track, station, and rolling stock management. In addition to being state-sponsored for operation, income comes from ticket sales and advertisements in stations (controlled by a daughter company &quot;Metroreklama&quot;). Metro lines are being constructed by &quot;Kyivmetrobud&quot; public company which allocates segments of construction to individual brigades that are responsible for tunnel and station construction. Kyivmetrobud is directly funded by the profits of the Kyiv Metro and from the city and state budgets. Most of the state funding comes from Kyiv&#x27;s municipality, while additional subventions are directly received from the state budget since the fares do not correspond to the optimal price which will give the possibility for the Kyiv underground to develop itself.

In 2016, the Kyiv Metro received ₴76.1 million in net income (about US$2.85 million), compared with its ₴119 million loss a year earlier.

The current director is Viktor Brahinsky.

===Ticketing===
A single ride costs ₴8.00 ($0.29) regardless of destination and number of transits within the metro. The ride is paid for by paper QR tickets or contactless cards.

==== Contactless cards ====
Contactless (RFID-based, MIFARE Classic and Ultralight) cards are used to enter the metro. A card can be purchased for a small fee (₴15 ($0.54); refundable should one want to return the card) from cashiers and loaded for up to 50 trips at once (so that not to exceed the 100-ride limit). There is a special gradual scale of prices, such that every tenth purchased access (bought once) makes every previous one cheaper by ₴0.30. To clarify, the first 9 ride accesses cost the standard amount, whereas for 10-19 rides, the price for each one is ₴7.70; for 20-29 rides, ₴7.40; and so on. Thus, loading the card with 50 rides costs only ₴6.50 ($0.23) per ride.

The passenger can also pay for the fare using a bank card. MasterCard PayPass and Visa PayWave cards are accepted. Google Pay and Apple Pay can also be used.

The cards can be recharged either by a cashier or by using a terminal. The terminals accept hryvnia paper bills in denominations of ₴1 to ₴50, but do not return change; instead, they refill the card for the maximum possible number of rides given the sum of money deposited into the machine, and store the remainder in the system, to be used at next refill.

Monthly or 2 week passes with unlimited rides (₴380 ($13.46) per month) or a limited number of rides (62 or 46 rides per month, or half of it for 15 days, with the fare of ₴3.87 and ₴4.13 per ride, respectively) can also be purchased. A seven-minute second-use lockout is imposed for all unlimited cards to prevent abuse. Quarterly and yearly tickets were used until December 2009, when they stopped being released because they generated an estimated ₴115.6 million (about $14.5 million) of losses annually.

From the late 1990s until the early 2000s, monthly unlimited metro passes with a magnetic strip were used. Due to reliability and counterfeiting issues, these were phased out in favor of RFID cards.

=== Historical fares ===

Originally the Metro ride cost was 50 kopecks; however, in 1961, following a revaluation of the Soviet ruble, the ride was fixed at 5 kopecks for the next 30 years. After 1991, as Ukraine suffered from hyperinflation, the price gradually rose to 20,000 karbovanets in 1996. Following the 1996 denomination, 20,000 karbovanets became ₴0.20 (20 kopiyok), although the karbovanets sum was still payable up to 16 September that year. Since then, the price has risen to ₴0.50 in 2000 and ₴2.00 in 2008. In November 2008, when the price was increased to ₴2.00, public protests took place and the Antitrust Committee of Ukraine ordered to decrease of the price to ₴1.70. In September 2010, the price was increased back to ₴2.00. In February 2015, the price was further increased. The last increase occurred on 15 July 2017.

The fares are set by the Kyiv City State Administration subject to the approval of the Ministry of Infrastructure.

A proposal to set prices according to the distance traveled, or time spent in the metro, is being discussed. For this purpose, specially built &quot;long&quot; exit turnstiles with card readers at the far end have already been installed at some station exits.
==== Tokens ====

For many decades, plastic tokens were used for turnstiles; one token per person could be bought from station cashiers or automatic exchange machines. In recent decades, green tokens were used in 2000-2010 and 2015–2018; blue tokens were used in 2010-2015 and since 2018. Initially, the green (old) tokens were to be substituted by QR-code tickets (introduced in August 2017) and RFID cards.

The use of these tokens was gradually phased out. On 15 July 2019, Nyvky and Ipodrom stations became the first to stop selling and accepting tokens. Tokens were scheduled to be sold until 30 October 2019 and accepted until 3 November 2019; however, tokens were still being sold and used on 15 November 2019. In April 2020, tokens finally went out of circulation.

== Planned improvements and expansion ==
In 2012, plans for the Kyiv Metro aimed to nearly double its length by 2025. Whilst completion of this plan is not considered to be feasible, several new stations have opened since the turn of the millennium.

=== Construction of additional lines ===
====Line 4 (Podilsko-Vyhurivska)====

The fourth line of the Kyiv Metro (also known as the Podilsko-Voskresenska line) will connect the northern Troieshchyna districts in the east with the future business center of Rybalskyi Peninsula on the Dnieper River, and from there arc around the Podil neighborhood. The line will continue westwards along the northern slope of the Starokyivska Hora and into the northwestern part of central Kyiv, where it will turn south and reach the Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi Railway Station. In doing so, it will offer transfers to all three other Metro lines and thus relieve the over-congested transfer points in the center. The last planned stage will connect the line to Kyiv&#x27;s Zhuliany airport and the residential districts along the way.

This line first appeared in plans in 1980, when a new plan for Kyiv Metro development appeared. The section between Voskresenka (2 km south of Troieshchyna) and Vokzalna (through Chervona Ploshcha (now Kontraktova Ploshcha station), instead of today&#x27;s plan to direct it via Tarasa Shevchenka), was planned to be open by 2000. Due to protests over the passage of the line through the historical neighborhood of Podil, the line was rerouted.

Construction started in 1993, from the Podilsko-Voskresenskyi bridge. It was later stopped due to financial difficulties. This remains the only built section of the line. A second attempt was made in 2004, and it was expected that the bridge would be opened three years later, but work was again halted because the bridge had to pass through Rusanivski Sady, where the houses were to be demolished without compensation, which resulted in protest from residents. Other factors that contributed to the suspension of the project included problems with construction and the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Work on the bridge was only restarted in mid-2017, and it was forecasted to be opened by the end of 2021.

The feasibility of the line has been subject to discussion, and alternative projects have been proposed, such as the construction of a light rail or light metro instead. Nevertheless, as of 6 July 2017, the subway option is still preferred, despite the route being altered from plan to plan.

In May 2017, the Kyiv City Council signed a memorandum with a Chinese consortium (which includes the China Railway International Group and the China Pacific Construction Group) to assess the current advancement of the project and, eventually, to finally construct the line. The first segments of the line (colloquially called &quot;metro to Troieshchyna&quot;) are planned to be finished by 2025, while further construction will most probably end after 2030.

==== Line 5 (Livoberezhna) ====

This line first appeared as a planned line on maps in 1974.

The northern end of the fifth line of the system exists already as part of the Kyiv tram. However, it will require conversion and, according to some projects, will be temporarily operated as a branch of the Podilsko-Vyhurivska line (4th line). Eventually, a southward extension will commence that will follow along the eastern bank of the Dnieper to the Southern Osokorky district. This is the last Metro project that is envisioned in the present expansion plan and is not expected to be completed until the end of the 2030s.

In 2009, it was planned that the first stage of this line will be launched in 2019. As of 6 July 2021, however, no section of the line has been opened.

==== Line 6 (Vyshhorodsko-Darnytska) ====

This is a proposed line in the Kyiv underground. Currently, it is under planning. The line is expected to be built in the distant future—as of 2012, any construction was predicted to start only after 2025. However, shortly after the announcement of such a proposal, the project has been resigned from.

=== Extensions ===

==== Line 1 extensions ====
One potential long-term extension of the M1 line is to the town of Brovary, to the east of Kyiv. A much more feasible short-term extension is to Novobilychi station, with a depot. In 2011, Volodymyr Fedorenko, then-head of the Kyiv Metro communal enterprise, said this extension might be constructed by 2020. However, this construction has not happened, as the Line 4 construction is currently the absolute priority; moreover, Novobilychi station&#x27;s location will not bring the line to any significant residential area (Bilychi, the nearest area, is already west of Akademmistechko station), although it will connect with a train station. As of 5 May 2021, no tenders have taken place. The westward extension might continue further into Berkovets.

==== Line 2 (southern extension) ====
A planned extension of the M2 line will feature a side branch: the side branch will go to the Teremky bus station, which opened in December 2016, and Dmytro Lutsenko street, and will serve the Teremky-2 and Teremky-3 residential areas, while the main line is expected to go further southwest to Odeska station. For the moment, this extension is not a priority.

==== Line 3 (eastward extension) ====
Several extension proposals for the M3 line have been made. In the 2005 general plan, the line was supposed to turn sharply from Chevonyi Khutir to Darnytsia railway station, with a subsequent extension to Livoberezhna. Presumably, the proposal was declined, as later plans do not include any lines&#x27; prolongation beyond Chervonyi Khutir. In April 2017, Kyiv&#x27;s Mayor Vitali Klitschko and Ukraine&#x27;s Minister of Infrastructure, Volodymyr Omelyan, announced they &quot;were talking about the project of subway extension from Boryspilska metro station to Boryspil airport with the help of private financing&quot;, although the project&#x27;s approximately extension is unlikely to happen soon.

==== Line 3 (northward extension) ====
The northward extension to Vynohradar has been a long-planned event, with the first maps appearing in the newspaper &quot;Evening Kyiv&quot; in August 1970.

In February 2017, an article suggested that the plans were already given for analysis and that construction had to start by late 2017. The article mentions that the project will feature an engineering feat not made before in Kyiv: instead of parallel tunnels, one tunnel will be on top of another. On 6 July 2017, the Chinese Machinery Engineering Corporation said it was ready to invest and build the line to Vynohradar. In February 2017, the line&#x27;s extension and two stations—Mostytska and Varshavska (earlier known as Prospekt Pravdy)—were scheduled for opening in late 2019. In November 2018, Kyiv Metro signed a contract for the construction of the Mostytska and Varshavska subway stations and a branch line toward the Vynohradar station; the deadline for completion was set for 2021. In the contract, it was agreed that the Chamber of Commerce would judge on possible justifiable force majeure that would slow down the work. In early September 2021, the Chamber of Commerce judged there was such, and the expiration of the contract with the Kyiv Metro was to be postponed from November 2021 to May 2023. The opening of the stations was further delayed to 2024 in July 2023.

Further plans feature another extension to Marshala Hrechka station with Vynohradar depot built as well.

==Language ==
=== Ukrainian, Russian, and English languages ===
When the Metro was opened in 1960, although many workers and all technical-level documents used Russian, all the signs and announcements used Ukrainian exclusively. The lexical similarity of the languages allowed every station to have a Russian translation, and these were often given in Russian language literature and media. However, some Ukrainian names for stations were different from Russian ones, and to signify this, those stations were sometimes partially translated into Russian, effectively blending Ukrainian words into Russian grammar. Examples of this include the station names &quot;Ploshcha&quot; &quot;Zhovtnevoi Revolutsii&quot;, &quot;Zhovtneva&quot;, and &quot;Chervonoarmiyska&quot; (later renamed to Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Beresteiska, and Palats Ukraina, respectively) which when translated into Russian would become &quot;Oktyabrskaya&quot; and &quot;Krasnoarmeiskaya.&quot; The names were instead given as &quot;Zhovtnevaya&quot; and &quot;Chervonoarmeiskaya.&quot;

In the early to mid-1980s, due in part to both Volodymyr Shcherbytsky&#x27;s gradual Russification campaign and Kyiv becoming increasingly Russophonic, the metro started to change as well. Although the stations retained their original Ukrainian titles on the vestibules, Russian appeared together with Ukrainian on the walls and replaced Ukrainian in signs and voice announcements. Stations that were opened during this period still had Ukrainian names appearing along with Russian ones on the walls, but now all the decorations where slogans were included, became bilingual. Also during this time, the practice of blending Ukrainian into Russian was dropped, and those selected stations were named in standard Russian translation.

During Perestroika in the late 1980s, bilingualism was gradually introduced in signs and voice announcements on trains. Before 1991, this was done with Ukrainian following Russian, but after the republic proclaimed independence in August 1991, the order was changed to Ukrainian preceding Russian. After the fall of the Soviet Union in late 1991, both signs and voice announcements were changed from bilingual to just Ukrainian as the official language of the state. However, the Russian names are still used in Russian-language literature and some documentation, and some of the decorations still feature bilingual inscriptions.

The usage of English in stations started just before the Euro-2012 football tournament, and all of Kyiv&#x27;s underground stations now feature English with Latin transliteration on signs and official maps. English is used for the station arrival announcements on par with Ukrainian.

== History of station names ==
Some of Kyiv&#x27;s underground stations have been renamed before and (to a greater extent) after they were completed. The only station to be renamed during the Soviet period occurred in 1977 when the name of &quot;Ploshcha Kalinina&quot; was changed to &quot;Ploshcha Zhovtnevoi Revolutsii&quot; for the upcoming 60th anniversary of the October Revolution.

During the 1990s, more changes occurred, mostly relating to stations with names connected to Communism. On 15 October 1990, &quot;Chervona Ploshcha&quot; became &quot;Kontraktova Ploshcha&quot;, and &quot;Prospekt Korniychuka&quot; became &quot;Obolon&quot;. A half-built station, due to be called &quot;Artema&quot;, was renamed &quot;Lukianivska&quot;. On 26 August 1991, following Ukraine&#x27;s declaration of independence, &quot;Ploshcha Zhovtnevoi Revolutsii&quot; became known as &quot;Maidan Nezalezhnosti&quot;. In 1993, nine stations, most of which bore communist symbolism in their name, were given politically neutral names:
In 2011, &quot;Respublikanskyi Stadion&quot; became &quot;Olimpiiska&quot;, in honour of the forthcoming Euro-2012 football tournament. In 2018, &quot;Petrivka&quot; (named after the Soviet politician Grigory Petrovsky) was re-designated as &quot;Pochaina&quot; after the river that once flowed nearby, to comply with 2015 decommunization laws.

In 2022, as part of derussification efforts following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, the following stations were renamed:

<text>Lenola was an American indie rock band formed in New Jersey in 1994, originally envisioned as a four-track project by lead man Jay Laughlin, but with the addition of guitarist David Grubb and drummer Sean Byrne, eventually became a standard band. After the addition of bassist Scott Colan and keyboard player Chris Laughlin, Lenola released several singles on the self-funded Tappersize label before releasing their first album in 1996. In 2001, File Thirteen Records released their full-length CD, &quot;Treat Me To Some Life&quot;. Their final album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Sharks &amp; Flames&quot; double CD was released in Japan and Europe but has yet to be issued in the US. Powered by strong guitars, Lenola has been compared to My Bloody Valentine, The Boo Radleys, Mercury Rev, and The Flaming Lips. In 2003, the group disbanded.

<doc id="639610" wikidata="Q1410142" url="?curid=639610" title="South American lungfish">
<text>The South American lungfish (Lepidosiren paradoxa), also known as the American mud-fish and scaly salamanderfish, is the single species of lungfish found in swamps and slow-moving waters of the Amazon, Paraguay, and lower Paraná River basins in South America. Notable as an obligate air-breather, it is the sole member of its family Lepidosirenidae, although some authors also place &quot;Protopterus&quot; in the family. In Brazil, it is known by the indigenous language Tupi name , which means &quot;snake-fish&quot; (), and synonyms (), (), and ().

==Taxonomy==
The South American lungfish is most closely related to the African lungfishes (family Protopteridae), and both families are thought to have diverged during the Early Cretaceous. Some papers suggest classifying both &quot;Lepidosiren&quot; and &quot;Protopterus&quot; within Lepidosirenidae, though authorities continue to classify both as distinct families.

==Description==
The immature lungfish is spotted with gold on a black background; in the adult, this fades to a brown or gray color. Its tooth-bearing premaxillary and maxillary bones are fused as in all Dipnoi. South American lungfish also share an autostylic jaw suspension (where the palatoquadrate is fused to the cranium) and powerful adductor jaw muscles with the other extant Dipnoi. Like the African lungfishes, this species has an elongated, almost eel-like body. It may reach a length of . The pectoral fins are thin and thread-like, while the pelvic fins are somewhat larger, and set far back. The fins are connected to the shoulder by a single bone, which is a marked difference from most fish, whose fins usually have at least four bones at their base, and a marked similarity with nearly all land-dwelling vertebrates. The gills are greatly reduced and essentially non-functional in the adults.


Juvenile lungfish feed on insect larvae and snails, while adults are omnivorous, adding algae and shrimp to their diets, crushing them with their heavily mineralized tooth-plates. The fish&#x27;s usual habitats disappear during the dry season, so they burrow into the mud and make a chamber about down, leaving a few holes to the surface for air. During this aestivation, they produce a layer of mucus to seal in moisture, and slow their metabolism down greatly.

Relatively little is known about the South American lungfish. They have adapted to cope with both droughts and floods due to evolving pulmonary mechanoreceptors. When the rainy season begins, they come out and begin to mate. The parents build a nest for the young, which resemble tadpoles and have four external gills. To enrich the oxygen in the nest, the male develops highly vascularized structures on his pelvic fins that release additional oxygen into the water. The young become air-breathing at about seven weeks. Juveniles have external threadlike gills very much like those of newts.
Fossils of the modern species have been found between 72 and 66 mya during the Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous just before the KPG extinction that killed off the non-avian dinosaurs.

As of August 2024, L. paradoxa has one of the longest genomes of any species (91 billion bases, 30 times as many as the human genome). The largest genome belongs to the marbled lungfish, with 130 billion bases. PiRNA, a type of RNA that normally suppresses transposon activity, was found in low levels in the animal and is possibly among the causes of such a large genome.

<doc id="639611" wikidata="Q1390233" url="?curid=639611" title="John LeClair">
<text>John Clark LeClair (born July 5, 1969) is an American former professional ice hockey player. He played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Montreal Canadiens, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins from 1991 to 2006. With the Flyers, LeClair became the first American-born player to score 50 goals in three consecutive NHL seasons while playing on the Legion of Doom line with Eric Lindros and Mikael Renberg. LeClair was a member of the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; Stanley Cup winning team in 1993.

==Early life==
LeClair was born on July 5, 1969, in St. Albans, Vermont, a town close to the Canada–US border. He is the son of Robert &quot;Butch&quot; LeClair, a manager of a paint store, and Beverly (Clark), a surgical nurse. LeClair has three older sisters, Mary Kay, Nancy, and Susan, and a younger brother, Joseph.

Although familiar with hockey, LeClair&#x27;s father Butch never actually played the sport himself. Until the 1960s, there was no organized hockey in the Saint Albans area. Despite this, LeClair took notice and asked his father for a pair of hockey skates at age six. Butch recalls how the kids in the area first played:

At first, they played in an old railroad shed. Then they got a bunch of people who signed a note and built Coote Field Arena. It was just a metal shack with a lunch bar and an old tractor to scrape the ice. It was kind of primitive, but it worked very well. It produced some good hockey.

Richard Benoit, the father of John&#x27;s friend Jeremy, created a homemade rink for the kids in his backyard by flooding his volleyball court. Benoit added boards around the edge and installed lights so they could play at night. There was also a shack complete with a heater for the kids to go to warm up if needed.

==High school and college years==
When LeClair was a freshman at Bellows Free Academy, he didn&#x27;t make the very competitive high school team. So, he continued to play in community leagues. In his sophomore year, LeClair made the team and earned attention. &quot;We&#x27;d be dumping the puck in (during a line change), and there would be John, in the corner on his knees and hands, five against one, somehow getting the puck out of the corner,&quot; recalls Luke Cioffi, a teammate and childhood friend of LeClair&#x27;s.

Soon, the young LeClair was attracting attention. College scouts began to take notice when he participated as a junior in &quot;Hockey Night in Boston&quot;, a showcase for young talent. LeClair decided to pursue college, and he was accepted at the University of Vermont (UVM). At UVM, LeClair&#x27;s college career was hampered by injuries. Over the course of his sophomore and junior years, he appeared in only 28 games. After missing the first month of his senior season due to meningitis, he finished the season strong with 25 goals and 20 assists in only 33 games.

==Playing career==

===Montreal Canadiens===
LeClair was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens with the 33rd pick in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft after graduating from Bellows Free Academy (B.F.A.) High School in St. Albans, Vermont. One of the most highly recruited hockey players in New England, LeClair put his NHL aspirations on hold to attend the University of Vermont on a full scholarship. His fans didn&#x27;t have to wait long to see him score in his first collegiate game. After the final game of his senior year he signed with the Canadiens and, less than a week later, played and scored in his first NHL game. As a member of the Canadiens, LeClair was on the Stanley Cup-winning team in 1993, where he scored two overtime game-winning goals during the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals. LeClair became the first Vermont-born player to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup as a result.

===Philadelphia Flyers and the Legion of Doom===
On February 9, 1995, a Montreal team desperate to salvage a difficult season traded LeClair, along with Éric Desjardins and Gilbert Dionne to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Mark Recchi and Philadelphia&#x27;s third round choice in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft (Martin Hohenberger). LeClair gelled immediately with new line-mate Eric Lindros and quickly became one of the NHL&#x27;s most feared goal scorers.

With the Flyers, he played left-wing on the famed &quot;Legion of Doom&quot; line, centered by Lindros and Mikael Renberg on right-wing. The trio was not only effective at scoring but they were also a dominant physical presence on the ice. In 1998, LeClair became the first American-born NHL player to record three consecutive 50-goal seasons and the second Flyer to do so, behind Tim Kerr. Following the 1997–98 NHL season, LeClair had two consecutive 40-goal seasons.

During his first five seasons with the Flyers, LeClair was named to the season-ending NHL All-Star team, twice to the first team and three times to the second team. That is currently the highest total among retired players eligible for the Hockey Hall of Fame who have not been inducted.

LeClair played for the Flyers for 10 seasons and was one of the most productive players in franchise history, scoring 333 goals and an additional 35 in the playoffs, statistics good enough to place him in the top 10 Flyers&#x27; career goal scorers.

===Pittsburgh Penguins===

On July 23, 2005, as a result of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement which finally introduced a salary cap to the NHL, the Flyers were forced to part ways with their longtime alternate captain, and they bought out LeClair&#x27;s contract to create cap space. Rumors had LeClair going to the Boston Bruins or perhaps the Toronto Maple Leafs. Instead, LeClair signed a two-year deal with the Pittsburgh Penguins on August 15, 2005. LeClair had a successful season in Pittsburgh during the 2005–06 season, finishing fourth on the team in scoring as he passed the 400-goal mark and had his ninth 50+ point season.

LeClair struggled in the first quarter of the 2006–07 season, scoring only two goals and five assists through 21 games. On December 14, 2006, he and the Penguins agreed to a mutual release from his contract. LeClair retired following the season.

==Other information==

LeClair is president of the &quot;John LeClair Foundation&quot; which awards grants to non-profit Vermont organizations that sponsor programs for children. He currently divides his time between Haverford Township, Pennsylvania and his hometown of St. Albans, Vermont. LeClair was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009, the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame in 2012, and the Philadelphia Flyers Hall of Fame in 2014.

In June 2023, LeClair was hired by the Flyers as a special advisor to hockey operations.

<doc id="639613" wikidata="Q42696" url="?curid=639613" title="Oriental Shorthair">
<text>The Oriental Shorthair is a breed of domestic cat that is developed from and closely related to the Siamese cat. It maintains the modern Siamese head and body type but appears in a wide range of coat colors and patterns. Like the Siamese, Orientals have almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, and an elongated, slender, and muscular body. Their personalities are also very similar. Orientals are social, intelligent, and many are rather vocal. They often remain playful into adulthood, with many enjoying playing fetch. Despite their slender appearance, they are athletic and can leap into high places. They prefer to live in pairs or groups and also seek human interaction. Unlike the breed&#x27;s blue-eyed forebear, Orientals are usually green-eyed. The Oriental Longhair differs only with respect to coat length.

While the breed&#x27;s genetic roots are ultimately in Thailand, it was formally developed in the US by a number of New York area cat breeders, led by Vicky and Peter Markstein (PetMark cattery), who in 1971–72 were intrigued by lynx patterned and solid colored cats of a Siamese body type at Angela Sayers&#x27; Solitaire Cattery and at Patricia White&#x27;s. These were based on solid-colored cats with the body of a Siamese, bred by Baroness von Ullmann over the 1950s. An &quot;Oriental Shorthairs International&quot; was formed in 1973, and Peter Markstein presented the breed to the 1976 Annual Cat Fanciers Association, at the same time as the Havana Brown was presented by Joe Bittaker. In 1977 the Oriental Shorthair was accepted by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association for championship competition. Since 1997, it has also received recognition from the GCCF and various other cat breeding organizations. The breed is among the most popular among CFA members.

==Description==

=== Breed ===

The Oriental Shorthair is a member of the Siamese family of breeds, and can be found in various solid colors, and patterns such as smoke, shaded, parti-color/tortoiseshell, tabby and bicolor (any of the above, with white). Not all variants are acceptable to all organizations that recognize the breed.

=== Characteristics ===

Conforming Oriental Shorthairs, like any of the Siamese type, have almond-shaped eyes and a wedge-shaped head with large ears. Their bodies are typically &quot;sleek&quot; but muscular.

The long-haired version of the breed, the Oriental Longhair (recognized since 1995 by CFA), simply carries a pair of the recessive long hair genes.

=== Personality ===
Oriental Shorthair cats have high locomotion levels and are natural conversationalists. The adult Oriental Shorthair cats are considered to be active, curious and interested about surroundings by breeders and veterinarians.

=== Size ===
The Oriental Shorthair is a medium size cat. On average, males weigh from , with females weighing less than .

=== Health ===

==History and recognition==


According to the CFA, &quot;Orientals represent a diverse group of cats that have their foundation in the Siamese breed.&quot; The Siamese, in both pointed and solid colors, was imported to the UK from Siam (today, Thailand) in the later half of the 1800s, and from there spread widely, becoming one of the most popular breeds. The gene that causes the color to be restricted to the points is a recessive gene; therefore, the general population of the cats of Siam were largely self-colored (solid). When the cats from Siam were bred, the pointed cats were eventually registered as Siamese, while the others were referred to as &quot;non-blue eyed Siamese&quot; or &quot;foreign shorthair&quot;. Other breeds that were developed from the landrace cats of Thailand include the Havana Brown (which some breed registries classify as simply an Oriental Shorthair variant) and the Korat.

The Oriental Shorthair was accepted as an actual breed for championship competition in the US-headquartered CFA in 1977. In 1985, the CFA recognized the bicolor variant. Two decades later, the breed was finally recognized by the UK-based Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in 1997, but with some differences from CFA on coat conformation. GCCF publishes separate breed registration policies for a number of specific-coat Oriental Shorthair variants today. The Germany-based World Cat Federation (WCF) recognizes the breed, but with color requirements that are comparatively unrestrictive in some way, but notably opposed to white (&quot;All colours and patterns without white and without points are recognized.&quot;)

In the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA), some of the point-colored offspring from Oriental Shorthair parents are considered &quot;any other variety&quot; (AOV), but depending on the pedigree, some may compete as Colorpoints. In The International Cat Association (TICA) and many other cat fancier and breeder associations, these cats are considered to be, and compete as, Siamese, when recognized at all.

== Patterns ==
In total, over 300 coat color and pattern combinations are possible under CFA conformation rules. The basic types include:

* Solid: The coat color is uniform across the entire cat. Each hair shaft should be the same color from root to tip, and be free of banding and tipping. CFA-acceptable colors for this breed are red, cream, ebony, blue, lavender, cinnamon, fawn and white. The corresponding GCCF colors are (respectively) red, cream, brown, blue, lilac, chocolate and apricot (white is not permitted as the base color in GCCF, and WCF does not permit white at all).
* Shaded pattern: Will have a white undercoat with only the tips being colored CFA and GCCF recognize this. Other breed registries call this the &quot;chinchilla&quot; pattern.
* Smoke pattern: The hair shaft will have a narrow band of white at the base which can only be seen when the hair is parted. This white undercoat to any of the above solid colors (except white, of course) is provided by an interaction of two different genes. CFA and GCCF recognize this.
* Parti-color: Has patches of red and/or cream, which may be well-defined blotches of color, or marbled. This color pattern is referred to as tortoiseshell (or &quot;tortie&quot; for short) in non-pedigreed cats by CFA, and this alternative term is used by GCCF and organizations for pedigreed cats as well.
* Tabby coat pattern: Recognized by GCCF and CFA. Each hair shaft should have a band of color around the middle of the hair shaft. GCCF recognizes four variants of tabby: classic, mackerel, spotted and ticked.
*Bicolor pattern: Recognized by GCCF and CFA. The bicolor pattern is created by the addition of a white spotting gene to any of the other accepted colors/patterns. The cat will have white on its belly, on the legs/paws, and in an inverted &quot;V&quot; on the face. WCF does not permit this variant, as it is opposed to white in this breed.

== In popular culture ==
In scientific illustrator Jey Parks&#x27; 2017 book &quot;Star Trek Cats&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s Spock is depicted as an Oriental Shorthair.

In Joann Sfar&#x27;s comic &quot;The Rabbi&#x27;s Cat&quot;, the eponymous cat has the physical features of an Oriental Shorthair.

<doc id="639614" wikidata="Q186282" url="?curid=639614" title="Santa Maria Maggiore">
<text>The Basilica of Saint Mary Major (, ; ; ), or church of Santa Maria Maggiore (also referred to as Santa Maria delle Nevi from its Latin origin Sancta Maria ad Nives), is one of the four major papal basilicas as well as one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome and the largest Marian church in Rome, Italy. Santa Maria Maggiore is the first Marian sanctuary in the Western world and the mother of all sanctuaries.

The basilica enshrines the venerated image of &quot;Salus Populi Romani&quot;, depicting the Blessed Virgin Mary as the health and protector of the Roman people, which was granted a Canonical coronation by Pope Gregory XVI on 15 August 1838 accompanied by his papal bull &quot;Cælestis Regina&quot;.

Pursuant to the Lateran Treaty of 1929 between the Holy See and Italy, the Basilica is in Italy and not the Vatican City. However, the Holy See fully owns the basilica, and Italy is legally obligated to recognise its full ownership thereof and to concede to it &quot;the immunity granted by international law to the headquarters of the diplomatic agents of foreign states.&quot; In other words, the complex of buildings has a status somewhat similar to an embassy.
==Names==
The Basilica is sometimes referred to as Our Lady of the Snows, a name given to it in the Roman Missal from 1568 to 1969 in connection with the liturgical feast of the anniversary of its dedication on 5 August, a feast that was then denominated &quot;Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Nives&quot; (Dedication of Saint Mary of the Snows). This name for the basilica had become popular in the 14th century in connection with a legend that , during &quot;the pontificate of Liberius, a Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a vow to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary. They prayed that she might make known to them how they were to dispose of their property in her honor. On 5 August, at the height of the Roman summer, snow fell during the night on the summit of the Esquiline Hill. In obedience to a vision of the Virgin Mary which they had the same night, the couple built a basilica in honor of Mary on the very spot which was covered with snow.

The legend is first reported only after the year 1000. It may be implied in what the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; of the early 13th century says of Pope Liberius: &quot;He built the basilica of his own name near the Macellum of Livia&quot;. It is shown in the early 15th-century painting of the Miracle of the Snow by Masolino da Panicale.
The feast was originally called &quot;Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae&quot; (Dedication of Saint Mary&#x27;s), and was celebrated only in Rome until it was inserted into the General Roman Calendar, with &quot;ad Nives&quot; added to its name, in 1568. A congregation appointed by Pope Benedict XIV in 1741 proposed that the reading of the legend be struck from the Office and that the feast be given its original name. No action was taken on the proposal until 1969, when the reading of the legend was removed and the feast was called &quot;In dedicatione Basilicae S. Mariae&quot; (Dedication of the Basilica of Saint Mary). The legend is still commemorated by dropping white rose petals from the dome during the celebration of the Mass and during the Second Vespers on the feast day.

The earliest building on the site was the Liberian Basilica or Santa Maria Liberiana, after Pope Liberius (352–366). This name may have originated from the same legend, which recounts that, like John and his wife, Pope Liberius was told in a dream of the forthcoming summer snowfall, went in procession to where it occurred and there marked out the area on which the church was to be built. &quot;Liberiana&quot; is still included in some versions of the basilica&#x27;s name, and &quot;Liberian Basilica&quot; may be used as a contemporary as well as historical name.

On the other hand, the name &quot;Liberian Basilica&quot; may be independent of the legend, since, according to Pius Parsch, Pope Liberius transformed a palace of the Sicinini family into a church, which was for that reason called the &quot;Sicinini Basilica&quot;. This building was then replaced under Pope Sixtus III (432–440) by the present structure dedicated to Mary. However, some sources say that the adaptation as a church of a pre-existing building on the site of the present basilica was done in the 420s under Pope Celestine I, the immediate predecessor of Sixtus III.

Long before the earliest traces of the story of the miraculous snow, the church now known as Saint Mary Major was called &quot;Saint Mary of the Crib&quot; (&quot;Sancta Maria ad Praesepe&quot;), a name it was given because of its relic of the crib or manger of the Nativity of Jesus Christ, four boards of sycamore wood believed to have been brought to the church, together with a fifth, in the time of Pope Theodore I (640–649). This name appears in the Tridentine editions of the Roman Missal as the place for the pope&#x27;s Mass (the station Mass) on Christmas Night, while the name &quot;Mary Major&quot; appears for the church of the station Mass on Christmas Day.

==Status as a papal major basilica==
A Catholic church can only be honored with the title of &quot;basilica&quot; by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. St. Mary Major is one of the only four that hold the title of &quot;major basilica&quot;. The other three are the basilicas of St. John in the Lateran, St. Peter, and St. Paul outside the Walls. The title of major basilica was once used more widely, being attached, for instance, to the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels in Assisi). Along with the other major basilicas, St. Mary Major is also styled a &quot;papal basilica&quot;. Before 2006, the four papal major basilicas, together with the Basilica of St. Lawrence outside the Walls were referred to as the &quot;patriarchal basilicas&quot; of Rome. When Pope Benedict XVI abandoned the title &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot;, the title of St. Mary Major changed from patriarchal to papal basilica, as found on its website, and each was associated with one of the five ancient patriarchates. St. Mary Major was associated with the Patriarchate of Antioch.

The five papal basilicas along with the Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem and San Sebastiano fuori le mura were the traditional Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome, which were visited by pilgrims during their pilgrimage to Rome following a itinerary established by Philip Neri on 25 February 1552.

==History==

It is now agreed that the present church was built on the Cispian spur of Rome&#x27;s Esquiline Hill under Pope Celestine I (422–432) not under Pope Sixtus III (432–440), who consecrated the basilica on 5 August 434 to the Virgin Mary.

The dedicatory inscription on the triumphal arch, (Sixtus the bishop to the people of God), is an indication of that Pope&#x27;s role in the construction. As well as this church on the summit of the Esquiline Hill, Pope Sixtus III is said to have commissioned extensive building projects throughout the city, which were continued by his successor Pope Leo I, the Great.

The church retains the core of its original structure, despite several additional construction projects and damage by the earthquake of 1348.

Church building in Rome in this period, as exemplified in Santa Maria Maggiore, was inspired by the idea of Rome being not just the center of the world of the Roman Empire, as it was seen in the classical period, but the center of the Christian world.

Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the first churches built to celebrate the Virgin Mary, was erected immediately after the Council of Ephesus of 431, which proclaimed Mary Mother of God. Pope Sixtus III built it to commemorate this decision. Certainly, the atmosphere that generated the council gave rise also to the mosaics that adorn the interior of the dedication: &quot;whatever the precise connection was between council and church it is clear that the planners of the decoration belong to a period of concentrated debates on nature and status of the Virgin and incarnate Christ.&quot; The magnificent mosaics of the nave and triumphal arch, seen as &quot;milestones in the depiction&quot; of the Virgin, depict scenes of her life and that of Christ, but also scenes from the Old Testament: Moses striking the Red Sea, and Egyptians drowning in the Red Sea.

Richard Krautheimer attributes the magnificence of the work also to the abundant revenue accruing to the papacy at the time from land holdings acquired by the Catholic Church during the 4th and 5th centuries on the Italian peninsula: &quot;Some of these holdings were locally controlled; the majority as early as the end of the 5th century were administered directly from Rome with great efficiency: a central accounting system was involved in the papal chancery; and a budget was apparently prepared, one part of the income going to the papal administration, another to the needs of the clergy, a third to the maintenance of church buildings, a fourth to charity. These fines enabled the papacy to carry out through the 5th century an ambitious building program, including Santa Maria Maggiore.&quot;

Miri Rubin believes that the building of the basilica was influenced also by seeing Mary as one who could represent the imperial ideals of classical Rome, bringing together the old Rome and the new Christian Rome: &quot;In Rome, the city of martyrs, if no longer of emperors, Mary was a figure that could credibly carry imperial memories and representations.&quot;

Gregory the Great may have been inspired by Byzantine devotions to the &quot;Theotokos&quot; (Mother of God) when after becoming Pope during a plague in 590 that had taken the life of his predecessor, he ordered for seven processions to march through the city of Rome chanting Psalms and Kyrie Eleison, in order to appease the wrath of God. The processions began in different parts of the city, but rather than finally converging on St Peter&#x27;s, who was always the traditional protector of Rome, he instead ordered the processions to converge on Mary Major instead.

When the popes returned to Rome after the period of the Avignon papacy, the buildings of the basilica became a temporary Palace of the Popes due to the deteriorated state of the Lateran Palace. The papal residence was later moved to the Palace of the Vatican in what is now Vatican City.

The basilica was restored, redecorated and extended by various popes, including Eugene III (1145–1153), Nicholas IV (1288–1292), Clement X (1670–1676), and Benedict XIV (1740–1758), who in the 1740s commissioned Ferdinando Fuga to build the present façade and to modify the interior. The interior of the Santa Maria Maggiore underwent a broad renovation encompassing all of its altars between the years 1575 and 1630.

In 1966, archeologists excavating under the basilica found the remains of a Roman building including an imperial calendar with fasti and agricultural annotations and illustrations. On the basis of the calendar, the ruins have been dated to by Salzman and to the 4th century by Magi.

On 15 December 2015, two homeless Arab men attempted to disarm soldiers outside the basilica while yelling the takbir &quot;God is great&quot;. The 30 and 40 year old Palestinian and Tunisian called for others to help them as they threatened and assaulted the soldiers and police, but were arrested.

==Architecture==

The original architecture of Santa Maria Maggiore was classical and traditionally Roman, perhaps to convey the idea that Santa Maria Maggiore represented old imperial Rome as well as its Christian future. As one scholar puts it, &quot;Santa Maria Maggiore so closely resembles a second-century imperial basilica that it has sometimes been thought to have been adapted from a basilica for use as a Christian church. Its plan was based on Hellenistic principles stated by Vitruvius at the time of Augustus.&quot;

Even though Santa Maria Maggiore is immense in its area, it was built to plan. The design of the basilica was a typical one during this time in Rome: &quot;a tall and wide nave; an aisle on either side; and a semicircular apse at the end of the nave.&quot; The key aspect that made Santa Maria Maggiore such a significant cornerstone in church building during the early 5th century were the beautiful mosaics found on the triumphal arch and nave. 

The Athenian marble columns supporting the nave are even older, and either come from the first basilica, or from another antique Roman building; thirty-six are marble and four granite, pared down, or shortened to make them identical by Ferdinando Fuga, who provided them with identical gilt-bronze capitals. The 14th-century campanile, or bell tower, is the highest in Rome, at 246 feet, (about 75 m.). The basilica&#x27;s 16th-century coffered ceiling, to a design by Giuliano da Sangallo, is said to be gilded with gold, initially brought by Christopher Columbus, presented by Ferdinand and Isabella to the Spanish pope, Alexander VI. The apse mosaic, the Coronation of the Virgin, is from 1295, signed by the Franciscan friar, Jacopo Torriti. The Basilica also contains frescoes by Giovanni Baglione, in the Cappella Borghese. 

The 12th-century façade has been masked by a reconstruction, with a screening loggia, that was added by Pope Benedict XIV in 1743, to designs by Ferdinando Fuga that did not damage the mosaics of the façade. The wing of the &quot;canonica&quot; (sacristy) to its left and a matching wing to the right (designed by Flaminio Ponzio) give the basilica&#x27;s front the aspect of a palace facing the &quot;Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore&quot;. To the right of the Basilica&#x27;s façade is a memorial constituting a column in the form of an up-ended cannon barrel topped with a cross: it was erected by Pope Clement VIII to celebrate the end of the French Wars of Religion.

In the piazza in front of the facade rises a column with a Corinthian capital, topped with a statue of the Virgin and the child Jesus. This Marian column was erected in 1614 to the designs of Carlo Maderno during the papacy of Paul V. Maderno&#x27;s fountain at the base combines the armorial eagles and dragons of Paul V (Borghese). The column itself was the sole intact remainder from the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine in the Roman Forum. The statue atop the column was made by Domenico Ferri. In a papal bull from the year of its installation, the pope decreed three years of indulgences to those who uttered a prayer to the Virgin while saluting the column.

===Fifth-century mosaics===
The mosaics found in Santa Maria Maggiore are one of the oldest representations of the Virgin Mary in Christian late antiquity. As one scholar puts it, &quot;This is well demonstrated by the decoration of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome... where the iconographic depiction of the Virgin Mary was chosen at least in part to celebrate the affirmation of Mary as Theotokos (bearer of God) by the third ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431 CE.&quot; The mosaics of the triumphal arch and the nave in Santa Maria Maggiore gave a model for the future representations of the Virgin Mary. The influences of these mosaics are rooted in late antique impressionism that could be seen in frescoes, manuscript paintings and many pavement mosaics across villas in Africa, Syria and Sicily during the 5th century. This being said, the crowning of Mary on the Apse was made much later by Torriti by commission of Pope Nicholas IV. (13th century).

These mosaics gave historians insight into artistic, religious, and social movements during this time. As Margaret R. Miles explains the mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore have two goals: one to glorify the Virgin Mary as Theotokos (God-Bearer); and the other to present &quot;a systematic and comprehensive articulation of the relationship of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian scriptures as one in which the Hebrew Bible foreshadows Christianity.&quot; This is explained by the dual images of Old Testament and New Testament events depicted in the mosaics of the triumphal arch and the nave. The mosaics also show the range of artistic expertise and refute the theory that mosaic technique during the time was based on copying from model books. The mosaics found in Santa Maria Maggiore are combinations of different styles of mosaic art during the time, according to art scholar Robin Cormack: &quot;the range of artistic expertise and the actual complexities of production can hardly be reduced to a mentality of copying. A test case is given by the mosaics of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome&quot;.

===Triumphal arch===

The triumphal arch at the head of the nave was at first referred to as the apse arch, but later became known as the triumphal arch. The triumphal arch is illustrated with magnificent mosaics depicting different scenes of Christ and the Virgin Mary. There was a difference in the styles used in the triumphal arch mosaics compared to those of the nave; the style of the triumphal arch was much more linear and flat as one scholar describes it, not nearly as much action, emotion and movement in them as there were in the Old Testament mosaics of the nave. One of the first scenes that were visible on the triumphal arch was a panel of Christ&#x27;s enthronement with a group of angels as his court. As one historian describes it: &quot;On the apse arch Christ is enthroned, a young emperor attended by four chamberlains, angels of course&quot;, this is a perfect example of mosaic art in the 5th century. Another panel found on the triumphal arch is of the Virgin, she is crowned and dressed in a colorful veil, her wardrobe subtly brings to mind that of a Roman empress and in this panel she has her divine son walking with her and a suite of angels and Joseph ready to greet her; &quot;The Virgin...shows to perfection the impressionistic character of mosaics.&quot; Another panel is known as the Adoration of the Magi and this mosaic depicts Infant Christ and The Virgin and the arrival of the three wise men, &quot;mosaics illustrating Christ&#x27;s first coming and his youth covered the triumphal arch.&quot; The other panel depicts the Virgin accompanied by five martyrs.

===Nave===
The nave of the basilica was covered in mosaics representing Old Testament events of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt across the Red Sea. &quot;The nave mosaics (which represents stories of Old Testament history and accordingly offered Christians in Rome a new &#x27;past&#x27;) are illusionistic in a colorful and impressionist manner&quot; as this scholar puts it the scene was filled with movement, emotion, and it was to inspire thinking of Rome&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; past; the past of the Old Testament. As one scholar describes it: &quot;Moses strikes the waters of the Red Sea in a heroic gesture, his toga in light and dark grays and blues, but lined in black, the folds white lines, the tunic underneath light blue; the man next to him wears a deep blue toga over a gray and white tunic.&quot; Another panel shows the demise of the Egyptians in the Red Sea. An observer describes the mosaic: &quot;The Egyptians, clad in blue armor with gold bands and scarlet cloaks wildly flying, drown in the greenish-blue waters; the horses, white or light brown shaded with darker browns, highlighted in white, the accoutrements a bright red.&quot;

===Cappella Sistina and Crypt of the Nativity===

Under the high altar of the basilica is the Crypt of the Nativity or &quot;Bethlehem Crypt&quot;, with a crystal reliquary designed by Giuseppe Valadier said to contain wood from the Holy Crib of the nativity of Jesus Christ. Here is the burial place of Jerome, the 4th-century Doctor of the Church who translated the Bible into the Latin language (the Vulgate).
Fragments of the sculpture of the Nativity believed to be by 13th-century Arnolfo di Cambio were transferred to beneath the altar of the large Sistine Chapel off the right transept of the church. This chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is named after Pope Sixtus V, and is not to be confused with the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican, named after Pope Sixtus IV. The architect Domenico Fontana designed the chapel, which contains the tombs of Sixtus V himself and of his early patron Pope Pius V. The main altar in the chapel has four gilded bronze angels by Sebastiano Torregiani, holding up the ciborium, which is a model of the chapel itself.

Beneath this altar is the Oratory or Chapel of the Nativity, on whose altar, at that time situated in the Crypt of the Nativity below the main altar of the church itself, Ignatius of Loyola celebrated his first Mass as a priest on 25 December 1538.

Just outside the Sistine Chapel is the tomb of Gianlorenzo Bernini and his family.

The Mannerist interior decoration of the Sistine Chapel was completed (1587–1589) by a large team of artists, directed by Cesare Nebbia and Giovanni Guerra. While the art biographer, Giovanni Baglione allocates specific works to individual artists, recent scholarship finds that the hand of Nebbia drew preliminary sketches for many, if not all, of the frescoes. Baglione also concedes the roles of Nebbia and Guerra could be summarized as &quot;Nebbia drew, and Guerra supervised the teams&quot;.

Others include Ferdinando Sermei, Giacomo Stella, Paul Bril, and Ferraù Fenzoni.

===Cappella Paolina (or Borghese Chapel) and Salus Populi Romani===

The column in the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore celebrates the famous icon of the Virgin Mary now enshrined in the Borghese Chapel of the basilica. It is known as &quot;Salus Populi Romani&quot;, or &quot;Health of the Roman People&quot; or &quot;Salvation of the Roman People&quot;, due to a miracle in which the icon reportedly helped keep plague from the city. The icon is at least a thousand years old, and according to a tradition was painted from life by St Luke the Evangelist using the wooden table of the Holy Family in Nazareth.
The &quot;Salus Populi Romani&quot; has been praised by several popes and acted as a key Mariological symbol.

Prior to becoming the Pope Pius XII, Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli celebrated his first Catholic Mass before the image inside the Borghese Chapel on Easter Sunday, 2 April 1899. In December 1953, the icon was carried through Rome to initiate the first Marian year. On 1 November 1954, the icon was translated and officially crowned by Pope Pius XII at Basilica of Saint Peter as he gave a personal speech and introduced a new Marian feast Queenship of Mary.

Future pontiffs Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, and Pope Francis all visited the &quot;Salus Populi Romani&quot; and led liturgical celebrations.

==Papal basilica==
As a papal basilica, Santa Maria Maggiore is often used by the pope. He presides over the rites for the annual Feast of the Assumption of Mary on 15 August there. Except for a few priests and the basilica&#x27;s archpriest, the canopied high altar is reserved for use by the pope alone. Pope Francis visited the basilica on the day after his election.

The pope gives charge of the basilica to an archpriest, usually a cardinal. Formerly, the archpriest was the titular Latin Patriarch of Antioch, a title abolished in 1964. Since 29 December 2016, the archpriest has been Stanisław Ryłko.

In addition to the archpriest and his assistant priests, a chapter of canons is resident. Redemptorist, Dominican and Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate priests serve the church.

The King of Spain, currently Felipe VI, is &quot;ex officio&quot; protocanon of the basilica&#x27;s chapter.

Pope Francis visits the Basilica often, mainly to visit the Salus Populi Romani. He visits before and after trips outside the Vatican, calling the icon his &quot;great devotion&quot;. He has also constructed a tomb next to the icon to be his final resting place upon his death. Francis plans to be the first pope to be interred outside the Vatican since Pope Leo XIII in 1903.

<text>Green Apple Quick Step, often abbreviated as GAQS, is an American rock band from Seattle. Their sound was described as hard-edged, post-grunge rock. The band began as Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys in Tacoma, Washington before becoming Green Apple Quick Step, in Seattle, by 1992. The initial lineup under the new name consisted of lead vocalist Tyler Willman, guitarists Daniel Kempthorne and Steve Ross, singer-bassist Mari Ann Braeden, and drummer Bob &#x27;Mink&#x27; Martin.

The original lineup recorded and released two records: &quot;Wonderful Virus&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Reloaded&quot; in 1995. Their third album, &quot;New Disaster&quot;, was recorded in 1998, with new lineup including Dana Turner on guitar and Dain Hudson on drums was planned for release that year, but remains shelved. Their music has been featured on the soundtracks for three films, &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, and &quot;Homegrown&quot;.

They disbanded in 1998 and then re-emerged more than a decade later to perform more shows in 2010, with Willman hopeful of releasing their third album. As of May 2010, the band consisted of lead vocalist Ty Willman, guitarist Dana Turner, and drummer Geoff Reading, with guitarist Mike Squires and vocalist Christa Wells joining them for the reunion shows.

==History==

===Early years as Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys (1989–1992)===
Green Apple Quick Step started as the Tacoma-based band, Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys, consisting of vocalist Tyler Willman, guitarists Steve Ross and Dan Kempthorne, drummer Bob Martin and bassist Eric Munday. The band played a few shows locally and in 1989, Aroma Records released 700 copies of their numbered, limited edition purple vinyl EP,&quot;Another World&quot;, which was recorded at Tombstone Records and contained 4 songs: &quot;Soul Step&quot;, &quot;Seamonkeys&quot;, &quot;Another World&quot;, and &quot;Eleventeen&quot;. Munday left the band in 1992. The band that would eventually become Pearl Jam played their first-ever show (when they were still called Mookie Blaylock) for Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys, on October 22, 1990 at the Off Ramp Cafe in Seattle.

===Reformation and &quot;Wonderful Virus&quot; (1992–1994)===
Later in 1992, the band reformed in Seattle, Washington as Green Apple Quick Step, with a new bassist, Mari Ann Braeden. They performed locally, sharing bills with Sweet Water, Meddaphysical and Best Kissers in the World, before recording their debut album, &quot;Wonderful Virus&quot;, at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle The album was produced by Daniel Rey and released in 1993 through The Medicine Label, which was initially backed by Reprise Records before switching to Giant Records. They filmed a music video for the album track &quot;Dirty Water Ocean&quot; which depicted the band in a garbage sluice. The band toured in support of the album, performing with bands that included The Pleasure Elite Gruntruck and Sister Psychic. In order to keep secret a Pearl Jam show at the Off Ramp in Seattle, it was billed as a Green Apple Quick Step show, though the band was touring Eastern Washington at the time. In the middle of their fourth US tour in support of &quot;Wonderful Virus&quot;, their van was stolen along with all of their equipment inside. The band later packed up their remaining belongings and returned to Seattle to begin recording their second album.

===&quot;Reloaded&quot; (1994–1996)===
With Nick DiDia and Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard producing, Green Apple Quick Step began recording their second album in October 1994. The band had befriended Gossard previously and asked if he would be interested in working with the band. The album was primarily recorded at Gossard&#x27;s home studio, though Gossard asked not to receive any royalties. Unlike &quot;Wonderful Virus&quot;, their second album featured Willman splitting vocal harmonies with Braeden. Green Apple Quick Step&#x27;s second album entitled &quot;Reloaded&quot; was released on May 23, 1995, through The Medicine Label and was distributed by WEA.

The song &quot;Dizzy&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;, was chosen as the band&#x27;s first single from the album, followed by &quot;Los Vargos&quot; as the second single, while a three-song sampler of &quot;Los Vargos&quot;, “Underwater&quot; and &quot;Ed No. 5&quot; was sent to metal and hard rock radio stations. Although the songs failed to chart domestically, the single &quot;Los Vargos&quot; charted in Canada on RPM&#x27;s Alternative 30 chart, peaking at #23 in June 1995.

In support of the album, they began a residency tour, during which the band played several shows each in the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Phoenix before a starting a second residency tour of New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. They performed at the Bumbershoot arts and music festival at the Seattle Center Arena with The Presidents of the United States of America, Sky Cries Mary, Love Battery, Seaweed, The Spinanes and Supersuckers and they also supported Candlebox at their New Year&#x27;s show.

Willman and Braeden contributed to the song &quot;Oh! Sweet Nuthin&#x27;&quot;, by Mike McCready&#x27;s side-project $10,000 Gold Chain, which was featured on the soundtrack to the 1996 film &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;. Willman also sang with Devilhead, led by Kevin Wood and former members of Hater; recording lead vocals for one song, &quot;Buying Milk&quot;, on their album &quot;Pest Control&quot;, released in 1996 on Loosegroove Records.

===&quot;New Disaster&quot; and lineup changes (1996–1998)===
Green Apple Quick Step then signed with Columbia Records and spent over a year writing songs for their new album, prior to which, guitarist Ross left the band to later, along with Kempthorne, form The Briefs, under the pseudonym Steve E. Nix and Daniel J. Travanti. Guitarist Dana Turner took Ross&#x27; place, and they recorded their third album in Los Angeles at Ocean Way Studios with producer Matt Wallace. GAQS&#x27; drummer Geoff Reading noted in a March 2010 issue of his regular column in the Weekly Volcano that after &quot;New Disaster&quot; was recorded, drummer Bob Martin was also replaced, by Dain Hudson who appeared on the recording and later Geoff Reading who played live shows. Reading joined the band in June 1997 following a successful tryout in May 1997 and they recorded a music video for the album song &quot;Kid&quot;, which was later shown on MTV and featured on the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. The band performed at the premier of the film, receiving some radio airplay, which was later re-serviced to Seattle radio stations KNDD, KISW, Cleveland station WENZ, and Boston station WBCN. Another song from the album, &quot;Stars&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 comedy-thriller film &quot;Homegrown&quot;.

Willman formed a side project, Calm Down Juanita, with drummer Kevin Guess, that featured bassist Cole Peterson, engineer &amp; project catalyst Steve Wilmans, and contributions from several other notable &quot;players&quot;, including Braeden, who also plays bass on one song, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, on the five-song EP that band recorded during the summer of 1997.

Green Apple Quick Step continued to play shows in Seattle, and they played a show with 10 Minute Warning in Portland. Though a March 3, 1998 release date was set for &quot;New Disaster&quot;, Green Apple Quick Step&#x27;s management was not satisfied with the label&#x27;s efforts to promote the album, pulling it from the label with hopes of gaining another record deal. Green Apple Quick Step disbanded soon after.

===Post-breakup activities (1998–2009)===
Calm Down Juanita released their self-titled debut EP in 1998, and then recorded a follow-up LP, &quot;Undertown&quot;, which they released in 2002. Braeden also formed a female trio called Celebrity Damage.
Willman also recorded lead and backing vocals for some tracks on Stone Gossard&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Bayleaf&quot;, released in 2001. One of the tracks he sang, &quot;Unhand Me&quot;, was chosen as the first single from the album.

Willman also performed with several other projects including Hula Bess in July 1999, with former Gigolo Aunts&#x27; Phil Hurley and Mass Sugar in 2007–2008.

Reading joined New American Shame, in 1999, before joining Loaded, with former Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Duff McKagan, the following year. When Loaded went on hiatus in 2002, he formed The Disciples, that would later become The Chelsea Smiles, with Christian Martucci, Todd Youth, and Howie Pyro before Loaded reunited in 2008.

===Tribute Shows (2009–2010)===
A reconstituted Green Apple Quick Step performed at the Showbox at the Market in Seattle on December 20, 2009. After speaking with Ken Connell at the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen in Tacoma about performing another Green Apple Quick Step show, they later performed there on March 26, 2010. with a stage lineup consisting of Willman, Turner, and Reading, with guitarist Mike Squires of Reading&#x27;s previous band, Loaded, and singer Christa Wells. Willman has expressed hope of releasing the band&#x27;s third album. The following May 20, they played at the Crocodile Café in Seattle.

===Reunion (2018)===
Ty, MariAnn, Steve, Dan, and Geoff played two sold out shows with Candlebox at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle July 21, and 22, 2018. The original line up less Bob Martin (Geoff Reading on drums). They also played the Crocodile on December 23, 2018.

==Musical style==
Green Apple Quick Step&#x27;s music was described as post-grunge, alternative rock, pop rock and psychedelic rock. They have drawn some comparisons to the music of Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Porno for Pyros. Reviewing &quot;Reloaded&quot; for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that the band &quot;expands their sound by adding other styles to their basic grunge rock&quot; and that &quot;Experimenting with psychedelia and adding a better pop sensibility, the band sounds more confident and accomplished&quot;. Erlewine also reviewed the unreleased &quot;New Disaster&quot; album, stating that &quot;the band concentrates on hard-edged post-grunge rock.&quot;, and said of their sound that it was &quot;tighter than ever, but they still have trouble coming up with indelible hooks and melodies.&quot;

<text>A panel saw is any type of sawing machine that cuts sheets into sized parts.

==Types==
Panel saws can be vertical or horizontal. Typically, vertical saws take up less floor space. 

Horizontal machines are typically large table saws with a sliding feed table that pushes the material through the blade. Table saws without the sliding feed table can also cut sheet goods.

Vertical saws have two cost types, low cost and higher cost. Both types have the saw traveling through the short side of the sheet called cross cutting. For cutting lengthwise (rip) cut, the lower cost models, have the user slide the material through the saw while the higher cost models have the saw travel through the stationary material.

==History==
A sliding panel saw was invented by Wilhelm Altendorf in 1906 in Germany. Its invention set a new standard in woodworking, with dramatic differences from traditional machines. Up to that time, a conventional table saw had no mechanism for edging, meaning that for the first and second longitudinal cut on untreated massive wood, the lumber always had to be fed manually through the saw blade. The new system accomplished the task more elegantly by allowing the work piece to be fed through the saw blade while lying on a sliding table. Thus cutting becomes faster, accurate and effortless. 

Panel saws are used by cabinet shops to easily cut panels, profiles, solid wood, plywood, MDF, laminates, plastic sheets and melamine sheets into sizes or cabinet components. They are also used by sign shops to cut sheets of aluminum, plastic and wood for their sign blanks. Some higher end panel saws feature computer controls that move the blade and fence systems to preset values. Other lower end machines offer simplicity and ease of use, including full scale hobbyist level panel saws at a mere fraction of the cost. While the entry level machines are designed for light duty usage, they offer home DIYers a cheap alternative for infrequent cutting when accuracy and clean cuts are not required.

Panel saws can have one main saw blade, or a scoring along with a main saw blade. Scoring is used to create a groove, especially in double side laminate before the main saw rips the piece in two, to avoid chipping. The scoring saw rotates in an opposite direction, as the main saw to avoid chipping.

<doc id="639628" wikidata="Q477072" url="?curid=639628" title="Human Rights Act 1998">
<text>The Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom which received royal assent on 9 November 1998, and came into force on 2 October 2000. Its aim was to incorporate into UK law the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. The Act makes a remedy for breach of a Convention right available in UK courts, without the need to go to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg.

In particular, the Act makes it unlawful for any public body to act in a way which is incompatible with the convention, unless the wording of any other primary legislation provides no other choice. It also requires the judiciary (including tribunals) to take account of any decisions, judgment or opinion of the European Court of Human Rights, and to interpret legislation, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights.

However, if it is not possible to interpret an Act of Parliament so as to make it compatible with the convention, the judges are not allowed to override the Act of Parliament. All they can do is issue a declaration of incompatibility. This declaration does not affect the validity of the Act of Parliament: in that way, the Human Rights Act seeks to maintain the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, pursuant to the Constitution of the United Kingdom. However, judges may strike down secondary legislation. Under the Act, individuals retain the right to sue in the Strasbourg court.

==Background==
The convention was drafted by the Council of Europe after World War II. Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe was the Chair of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions of the council&#x27;s Consultative Assembly from 1949 to 1952, and oversaw the drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights. It was designed to incorporate a traditional civil liberties approach to securing &quot;effective political democracy&quot; from the strong traditions of freedom and liberty in the United Kingdom. As a founding member of the Council of Europe, the United Kingdom acceded to the European Convention on Human Rights in March 1951. However it was not until the 1960s that British citizens were able to bring claims in the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). During the 1980s, groups such as Charter 88, which invoked the 300th anniversary of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the Bill of Rights 1689, accused the executive of misusing its power and argued that a new British Bill of Rights was needed to secure human rights in the United Kingdom.

In its manifesto for the 1997 general election, the Labour Party pledged to incorporate the European Convention into domestic law. When the election resulted in a landslide Labour victory, the party, under the leadership of Tony Blair, fulfilled the pledge by the Parliament passing the Human Rights Act the following year.

The 1997 White Paper &quot;Rights Brought Home&quot; stated:

It takes on average five years to get an action into the European Court of Human Rights once all domestic remedies have been exhausted; and it costs an average of £30,000. Bringing these rights home will mean that the British people will be able to argue for their rights in the British courts – without this inordinate delay and cost.

==Structure==
The Human Rights Act places a duty on all courts and tribunals in the United Kingdom to interpret legislation so far as possible in a way compatible with the rights laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights (section 3(1)). If that is not possible, the court may issue a &quot;declaration of incompatibility&quot;. The declaration does not invalidate the legislation but permits the amendment of the legislation by a special fast-track procedure under section 10 of the Act as well. As of September 2006, 20 declarations had been made, of which six were overturned on appeal.

The Human Rights Act applies to all public bodies within the United Kingdom, including central government, local authorities, and bodies exercising public functions. However, it does not include Parliament when it is acting in its legislative capacities.

===Section 3===

Section 3 is a particularly wide provision that requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention on Human Rights which are also part of the Human Rights Act. This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights Act from being impliedly repealed. Courts have applied this through three forms of interpretation: &quot;reading in&quot;, inserting words where there are none in a statute; &quot;reading out&quot;, where words are omitted from a statute; and &quot;reading down&quot;, where a particular meaning is chosen to be in compliance. They do not interpret a statute so as to give it a meaning that would conflict with legislative intent, and courts have been reluctant in particular to &quot;read out&quot; provisions for this reason. If it is not possible to so interpret, they may issue a declaration of incompatibility under section 4.

Section 3 does not apply to the Illegal Migration Act 2023.

===Sections 4 and 10===
Sections 4 and 10 allow courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility where it is impossible to use section 3 to interpret primary or subordinate legislation to be compatible with the articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, which are also part of the Human Rights Act. In these cases, interpretation to comply may conflict with legislative intent. It is considered a measure of last resort. A range of superior courts can issue a declaration of incompatibility.

A declaration of incompatibility is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made, nor can a declaration invalidate legislation. Section 4 therefore achieves its aim through political rather than legal means.

Section 10 gives a government minister the power to make a &quot;remedial order&quot; in response to either
* a declaration of incompatibility, from which there is no possibility of appeal, or
* a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights

A remedial order may &quot;make such amendments to the legislation as [the Minister] considers necessary to remove the incompatibility&quot;. Remedial orders do not require full legislative approval, but must be approved by resolutions of each House of Parliament. In especially urgent cases, Parliamentary approval may be retroactive.

Remedial orders may have retroactive effect, but no one may be guilty of a criminal offence solely as the result of the retroactive effect of a remedial order.

Section 10 has been used to make small adjustments to bring legislation into line with Convention rights although entirely new pieces of legislation are sometimes necessary.

As of December 2014, 29 declarations of incompatibility have been issued, of which
* 8 have been struck down on appeal
* 1 is pending appeal, as of December 2014
* 16 have been remedied through the ordinary legislative process (including amendment or repeal of the offending legislation).
* 3 have been addressed through remedial orders
* 1 has not been remedied.

The one case not to have been remedied, as of December 2014, is &quot;Smith v. Scott&quot;, concerning the right of serving prisoners to vote in the UK.

===Sections 6 to 9===
Although the Act, by its own terms, applies only to public bodies, it has had increasing influence on private law litigation between individual citizens leading some academics (source?) to state that it has horizontal effect (as in disputes between citizens) as well as vertical effect (as in disputes between the state and citizens). This is because section 6(3) of the Human Rights Act defines courts and tribunals as public bodies. That means their judgments must comply with human rights obligations of the state, whether a dispute is between the state and citizens, or between citizens, except in cases of declarations of incompatibility. Therefore, judges have a duty to act in compatibility with the Convention even when an action is a private one between two citizens.

The way that public duty is exercised in private law was dealt with in a June 2016 decision McDonald v McDonald &amp; Ors [2016 UKSC 28 (15 June 2016)] where the UK Supreme Court firstly considered the question &quot;... whether a court, when entertaining a claim for possession by a private sector owner against a residential occupier, should be required to consider the proportionality of evicting the occupier, in the light of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights&quot;

The Supreme Court decided (paragraph 46) that &quot;there are many cases where the court can be required to balance conflicting Convention rights of two parties, eg where a person is seeking to rely on her article 8 rights to restrain a newspaper from publishing an article which breaches her privacy, and where the newspaper relies on article 10. But such disputes arise not from contractual arrangements made between two private parties, but tortious or quasi-tortious relationships, where the legislature has expressly, impliedly or through inaction, left it to the courts to carry out the balancing exercise&quot;.

Therefore, In cases &quot;where the parties are in a contractual relationship in respect of which the legislature has prescribed how their respective Convention rights are to be respected&quot; then the Court decided, as set out in paragraph 59
&quot;In these circumstances, while we accept that the Strasbourg court jurisprudence relied on by the appellant does provide some support for the notion that article 8 was engaged when Judge Corrie was asked to make an order for possession against her, there is no support for the proposition that the judge could be required to consider the proportionality of the order which he would have made under the provisions of the 1980 and 1988 Acts. Accordingly, for the reasons set out in paras 40–46 above, we would dismiss this appeal on the first issue.&quot;

Paragraph 40 supposed that &quot;... it is not open to the tenant to contend that article 8 could justify a different order from that which is mandated by the contractual relationship between the parties, at least where, as here, there are legislative provisions which the democratically elected legislature has decided properly balance the competing interests of private sector landlords and residential tenants.&quot;

The duty of state judges to apply Convention rights to disputes between citizens is therefore about determining relationships between them, and applying domestic legislation accordingly. If the duty is carried out then it is likely there is Article 6 compliance.

Section 7 limits a right to bring proceedings under section 6 only to victims (or potential victims) of the unlawful act of the public authority.

Section 8 provides a right for a court to make any remedy they consider just and appropriate. A remedy under the Act is therefore not limited to a Declaration of incompatibility possibly taking into account the equitable maxim Equity delights to do justice and not by halves.

Section 9 provides a right to challenge the compliance of judicial acts made by the UK, but only by exercising a right of appeal as set out by the Access to Justice Act 1999 (although not precluding a right to judicial review). For example, whether a judicial act properly applies legislation, or not.

===Other sections===
Section 8 says that UK judges can grant any remedy that is considered just and appropriate.

Section 19 requires a minister introducing a bill to parliament to make a statement of compatibility or, if unable to give such an assurance, a statement that the government wishes to proceed anyway. The statement is normally published with (immediately before) the text of the bill.

==Rights protected==
Many rights established under the Human Rights Act 1998 were already protected under UK law, but the purpose of the Act was largely to establish the European Convention on Human Rights in British law.

Section 21(5) of the Act completely abolished the death penalty in the United Kingdom, effective on royal assent. The death penalty had already been abolished for all civilian offences, including murder (Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965) and treason (Crime and Disorder Act 1998), but remained in force for certain military offences (although these provisions had not been used for several decades).

This provision was not required by the European Convention (protocol 6 permits the death penalty in time of war; protocol 13, which prohibits the death penalty for all circumstances, did not then exist); rather, the government introduced it as a late amendment in response to parliamentary pressure.

The Act provides that it is unlawful for a &quot;public authority&quot; to act in such a way as to contravene &quot;Convention rights&quot;. For these purposes public authority includes any other person &quot;whose functions are functions of a public nature&quot;. It also explicitly includes the courts. Convention rights includes only those rights specified in section 1 of the Act (these are recited in full in Schedule 1). In the interpretation of those rights the Act provides that the domestic Courts &quot;may&quot; take into account the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

Section 7 enables any person with standing (as stipulated by Article 34 of the convention) to raise an action against a public authority that has acted or proposes to act in such a Convention-contravening manner. This is a more rigorous standard than is ordinarily applied to standing in English, although not Scottish, judicial review.

If it is held that the public authority has violated the claimant&#x27;s Convention rights, then the court is empowered to &quot;grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate&quot;. This can include an award of damages, although the Act provides limitations on the court&#x27;s capacity to make such an award.

However, the Act also provides a defence for public authorities if their Convention-violating act is in pursuance of a mandatory obligation imposed upon them by primary legislation. The Act envisages that this will ordinarily be a difficult standard to meet though since it requires the courts to read such legislation (and for that matter subordinate legislation) &quot;So far as it is possible to do so ... in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.&quot;

Where it is impossible to read primary legislation in a Convention compliant manner, the only sanction available to the courts is to make a declaration of incompatibility in respect of it. The power to do so is restricted to the higher courts. Such a declaration has no direct impact upon the continuing force of the legislation but it is likely to produce public pressure upon the government to remove the incompatibility. It also strengthens the case of a claimant armed with such a decision from the domestic courts in any subsequent appeal to ECtHR. In order to provide swift compliance with the convention the Act allows ministers to take remedial action to amend even offending primary legislation via subordinate legislation.

==Notable human rights case law==
* Lee Clegg&#x27;s murder conviction gave rise to the first case invoking the Act, brought by &quot;The Times&quot; in October 2000 which sought to overturn a libel ruling against the newspaper.
* &quot;Campbell v MGN Ltd&quot; [2002] EWCA Civ 1373: Naomi Campbell and Sara Cox both sought to assert their right to privacy under the Act. Both cases were successful for the complainant (Campbell&#x27;s on the second attempt; Cox&#x27;s attempt was not judicially decided but an out of court settlement was reached before the issue could be tested in court) and an amendment to British law to incorporate a provision for privacy is expected to be introduced.
* &quot;Venables and Thompson v News Group Newspapers&quot; [2001] 1 All ER 908: The James Bulger murder case tested whether the Article 8 (privacy) rights of Venables and Thomson, the convicted murderers of Bulger, applied when four newspapers sought to publish their new identities and whereabouts, using their Article 10 rights of freedom of expression. The judge, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, granted permanent global injunctions ordering that the material not be published because of the disastrous consequences such disclosure might have for the former convicts, not least the possibility of physical harm or death (hence claims for Article 2 rights (right to life) were entertained, and sympathised with).
* &quot;A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department&quot; [2004] UKHL 56: On 16 December 2004, the House of Lords held that Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, under whose powers a number of non-UK nationals were detained in Belmarsh Prison, was incompatible with the Human Rights Act. This precipitated the enactment of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 to replace Part 4 of the 2001 Act.
* &quot;R v Chauhan and Hollingsworth&quot;: Amesh Chauhan and Dean Hollingsworth were photographed by a speed camera in 2000. As is standard practice for those caught in this way, they were sent a form by the police asking them to identify who was driving the vehicle at the time. They protested under the Human Rights Act, arguing that they could not be required to give evidence against themselves. An initial judgment, by Judge Peter Crawford at Birmingham Crown Court, ruled in their favour, but this was later reversed. The same issue came to light in Scotland with &quot;Procurator Fiscal v Brown&quot; [2000] UKPC D3, in which a woman, when apprehended on suspicion of theft of a bottle of gin, was drunk and was asked by police to identify who had been driving her car (which was nearby) at the time she arrived at the superstore.
* &quot;Price v Leeds City Council&quot; [2005] EWCA (Civ) 289: On 16 March 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling that Leeds City Council could not infringe the right to a home of a Romani family, the Maloneys, by evicting them from public land. The court however referred the case to the House of Lords as this decision conflicted with a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).
* &quot;An NHS Trust v MB&quot;: In March 2006, the High Court in London ruled against a hospital&#x27;s bid to turn off the ventilator that kept the child, known as Baby MB, alive. The 19-month-old baby had the genetic condition spinal muscular atrophy, which leads to almost total paralysis. The parents of the child fought for his right to life, while medics said the invasive ventilation would cause an &quot;intolerable life&quot;.
* &quot;Connors v UK&quot;: A judgment given by ECtHR declared that Travellers who had their licences to live on local authority-owned land suddenly revoked had been discriminated against, in comparison to the treatment of mobile-home owners who did not belong to the traveller population, and thus their Article 14 (protection from discrimination) and Article 8 (right to respect for the home) rights had been infringed. However, there has never been a case where the Act has been successfully invoked to allow travellers to remain on greenbelt land, and indeed the prospects of this ever happening seem highly unlikely after the House of Lords decision in &quot;Kay v Lambeth LBC&quot; which severely restricted the occasions on which Article 8 may be invoked to protect someone from eviction in the absence of some legal right over the land.
* 2006 Afghan hijackers case: In May 2006, a politically controversial decision regarding the treatment of nine Afghan men who hijacked a plane to flee from the Taliban caused widespread condemnation by many tabloid newspapers (most notably &quot;The Sun&quot;), the broadsheets and the leaders of both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party. It was ruled by an Immigration Tribunal, under the Human Rights Act, that the hijackers could remain in the United Kingdom; a subsequent court decision ruled that the government had abused its power in restricting the hijackers&#x27; right to work.
* &quot;Mosley v News Group Newspapers Limited&quot; (2008), Max Mosley challenged an invasion of his private life after the &quot;News of the World&quot; exposed his involvement in a sadomasochistic sex act. The case resulted in Mr Mosley being awarded £60,000 in damages.

==Criticism==
===Excessive rights===

During the campaign for the 2005 parliamentary elections the Conservatives under Michael Howard declared their intention to &quot;overhaul or scrap&quot; the Human Rights Act:

The time had come to liberate the nation from the avalanche of political correctness, costly litigation, feeble justice, and culture of compensation running riot in Britain today and warning that the politically correct regime ushered in by Labour&#x27;s enthusiastic adoption of human rights legislation has turned the age-old principle of fairness on its head.

The schoolboy arsonist allowed back into the classroom because enforcing discipline apparently denied his right to education; the convicted rapist given £4000 compensation because his second appeal was delayed; the burglar given taxpayers&#x27; money to sue the man whose house he broke into; travellers who thumb their nose at the law allowed to stay on green belt sites they have occupied in defiance of planning laws.

The schoolboy referred to was speculatively suing for compensation and was a university student at the time of the court case. In addition, the claim was rejected.

===Judicial powers===

Constitutional critics since the Human Rights Bill was tabled at parliament claimed it would result in the unelected judiciary making substantive judgments about government policies and &quot;mass-legislating&quot; in their amendments to the common law resulting in a usurpation of Parliament&#x27;s legislative supremacy and an expansion of the UK courts&#x27; justiciability. A leading case of &quot;R (on the application of Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department&quot; highlights how the new proportionality test borrowed from ECtHR jurisprudence has allowed a greater scrutiny of the substantive merits of decisions of public bodies, meaning that actions against such bodies, judicial reviews, are more of an appeal than a traditional judicial review.

They stress the overriding interpretative obligation of courts under section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act to read primary legislation as Convention-compliant, so far as is possible, is not dependent upon the presence of ambiguity in legislation. Section 3(1) could require the court to depart from the unambiguous meaning that legislation would otherwise bear subject to the constraint that this modified interpretation must be one &quot;possible&quot; interpretation of the legislation. Paul Craig argues that this results in the courts adopting linguistically strained interpretations instead of issuing declarations of incompatibility.

===Journalistic freedom===
In 2008, Paul Dacre (as editor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;) criticised the Human Rights Act for allowing, in effect, a right to privacy at English law despite the fact that Parliament has not passed such legislation. He was referring to the indirect horizontal effect of the Human Rights Act on the doctrine of breach of confidence which has moved English law closer towards a common law right to privacy. In response, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer stated that the Human Rights Act had been passed by Parliament, that people&#x27;s private lives needed protection and that the judge in the case had interpreted relevant authorities correctly.

===Inadequacy===
In contrast, some have argued that the Human Rights Act does not give adequate protection to rights because of the ability for the government to derogate from Convention rights under article 15. Recent cases such as &quot;R (ProLife Alliance) v BBC&quot; [2002] EWCA Civ 297 have been decided in reference to common law rights rather than statutory rights. Where there is no clear precedent in the common law, judges remain accused of judicial activism.

===Terrorism-related complaints===
Some politicians in the two largest parties, including some ministers, have criticised the Human Rights Act as to the willingness of the judiciary to make declarations on incompatibility against terrorism legislation. Baron Reid argued that the Act was hampering the fight against global terrorism in regard to controversial control orders:

There is a very serious threat – and I am the first to admit that the means we have of fighting it are so inadequate that we are fighting with one arm tied behind our backs. So I hope when we bring forward proposals in the next few weeks that we will have a little less party politics and a little more support for national security.

==Planned replacement==
In 2007, Howard&#x27;s successor as Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, vowed to repeal the Human Rights Act if he was elected, instead replacing it with a Bill of Rights for Britain. The human rights organisation JUSTICE released a discussion paper entitled &quot;A Bill of Rights for Britain?&quot;, examining the case for updating the Human Rights Act with an entrenched bill.

Following the 2010 general election, the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement said that the Human Rights Act would be investigated.

In 2011, following controversial rulings from both the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, David Cameron suggested a &quot;British Bill of Rights&quot;. The government commission set up to investigate the case for a Bill of Rights had a split of opinion.

Judge Dean Spielmann, the President of ECtHR, warned in 2013 that the United Kingdom could not withdraw from the Convention on Human Rights without jeopardising its membership of the European Union. It has also been claimed that, since the Good Friday Agreement (which ended the sectarian terrorist violence of the Troubles) is founded on the convention, it would be breached by any withdrawal.

In 2013 a tribunal ruled that Poole borough council had violated the human rights act when they used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to conduct surveillance on a family over the matter of school catchment area.

In 2014, the Conservative Party planned to repeal the Act and replace it with a &quot;British Bill of Rights&quot;.

Following the 2015 election win for the Conservative Party, Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Justice, was charged with implementing the reforms which were previously blocked by the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government. The Conservative Party manifesto said that the new bill will &quot;break the formal link between British Courts and the European Court of Human Rights&quot;. As before 1998, claims relying on ECtHR jurisprudence which conflicted with the &quot;British Bill of Rights&quot; would have to go to a court in Strasbourg rather than being able to be heard in the UK.

However, the Conservatives&#x27; manifesto from the next general election in 2017 pledged to retain the Human Rights Act &quot;while the process of Brexit is underway&quot;.

This has since changed once again, as the rise of Suella Braverman in the Conservative Party saw the HRA campaigned against in its entirety. Her admission to Home Secretary led to the Nationality and Border&#x27;s Bill which was conceded as a likely breach of the act – nevertheless, Sunak has sought for Strasbourg to change the act to comply with the law. The act has received royal assent and a legal challenge is soon to be expected.

A potential replacement, the Bill of Rights Bill 2022, was drafted on 22 June 2022 but scrapped on 27 June 2023.

<text>Fame is a 1980 American teen musical drama film directed by Alan Parker and written by Christopher Gore. Set in New York City, it chronicles the lives and hardships of students attending The High School of Performing Arts, from their auditions to their freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years.

Producer David De Silva conceived the premise in 1976, partially inspired by the musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. He commissioned playwright Gore to write the script, originally titled &quot;Hot Lunch&quot;, before selling it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). After he was hired to direct the film, Parker rewrote the script with Gore, aiming for a darker and more dramatic tone. The script&#x27;s subject matter received criticism by the New York Board of Education, which prevented the production from filming in the actual High School of Performing Arts. The film was shot on location in New York City, with principal photography beginning in July 1979 and concluding after 91 days. Parker encountered a difficult filming process, which included conflicts with U.S. labor unions over various aspects of the film&#x27;s production.

&quot;Fame&quot; received a limited release beginning at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on May 12, 1980, and had a wide release in the United States on June 20, by United Artists. The film grossed over $42 million worldwide against a production budget of $8.5 million. It initially received a mixed response from reviewers who praised the music, but criticized the dramatic tone, pacing and direction although the film has been reappraised over the years. The film received several awards and nominations, including two Academy Awards for Best Original Song (&quot;Fame&quot;) and Best Original Score, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song (&quot;Fame&quot;). Its success spawned a media franchise encompassing several television series, a stage musical, and a remake released in 2009.

In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Auditions

In New York City in the late 1970s, a group of teenagers audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they are sorted into three departments: Drama, Music, and Dance. Accepted in the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, son of a well-known actress; Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl with an overbearing mother; and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. In the Dance department, Coco Hernandez coolly hints at how she could join any of the three departments while Lisa Monroe is talkative and nervous. Leroy Johnson attends to perform his part of a dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance teachers are more impressed by his talents than his friend&#x27;s.

Freshman year

The students learn during their first day of classes that academics are weighed equally with performance. In the lunchroom, Doris becomes overwhelmed by the energy and spontaneity of the other students (&quot;Hot Lunch Jam&quot;). She befriends Montgomery, but worries that she is too ordinary against the colorful personalities of the other students. As the year progresses, Coco tries to convince Bruno to book performing gigs with her. Leroy clashes with his English teacher Mrs. Sherwood over his refusal to do homework. It is later revealed that he is semi-illiterate. Bruno and his father argue over Bruno&#x27;s reluctance to play his electronic music publicly. Miss Berg, the school&#x27;s Dance teacher, warns Lisa that she is not working hard enough. Michael, a graduating senior, wins a prestigious scholarship and tells Doris that the William Morris Agency wants to send him out for auditions for television pilots.

Sophomore year

A new student, Hilary van Doren, joins the school&#x27;s Dance department and becomes romantically involved with Leroy. Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate the merits of traditional orchestras versus synthesized instruments. Bruno&#x27;s father plays his music (&quot;Fame&quot;) outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in the streets. As an acting exercise, the students are asked to divulge a painful memory. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while coming out in front of his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her stage mother to sing at a child&#x27;s birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol Freddie Prinze. Miss Berg drops Lisa from the Dance program, and after seemingly considering suicide in a New York City Subway station, Lisa drops her dance clothes on the subway tracks and decides to join the Drama department.

Junior year

Ralph and Doris discover their mutual attraction, but their growing intimacy leaves Montgomery feeling excluded. Hilary brings Leroy home, much to the shock of her father and stepmother. Ralph&#x27;s young sister is attacked by a junkie and Ralph lashes out at his mother&#x27;s attempts to comfort the child by taking her to the local Catholic church, instead of to a doctor. Doris begins to question her Jewish upbringing, changing her name to &quot;Dominique DuPont&quot; and straining the relationship with her mother. During a late-night showing of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; at the 8th Street Playhouse, Ralph encourages Doris to smoke marijuana. Intoxicated, Doris takes part in the stage show during the film&#x27;s &quot;Time Warp&quot; musical number. The next day, she realizes that as an actress she can put on any personality she wants, but is sobered upon running into Michael, who is struggling as an actor and waiting tables.

Senior year

Ralph performs comedy at Catch a Rising Star, where he garners some initial success, but falls into a hard-party lifestyle which upsets Doris. Given a prime spot at another comedy club, he bombs after clashing with both Doris and Montgomery over his new lifestyle. Disgusted with himself, Ralph believes his career is over, but is comforted by Montgomery, who tells him that failure is a part of the entertainment business. Hilary, now pregnant, plans to have an abortion and move to California to take a position with the San Francisco Ballet company. Coco is approached in a diner by a man claiming to be a director; she naïvely goes to his apartment for a screen test, but discovers that he is an amateur pornographic film director. He manipulates her into taking her shirt off, as he films her sobbing. Leroy is offered a position in Alvin Ailey&#x27;s dance company, but must graduate first in order to be accepted. After receiving a failing grade, he confronts a grieving Mrs. Sherwood outside her husband&#x27;s hospital room, but upon realizing that she has her own problems, he comforts her. During graduation, the student body showcases their talents by performing an original song (&quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;). The opening lines are sung by Lisa, Coco, and Montgomery. Intercut with the performance are scenes of Leroy dancing and Bruno playing with a rock band, finally sharing his music with others.

===Development and writing===
In 1976, talent manager David De Silva attended a stage production of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; and noticed that one of the musical numbers, &quot;Nothing&quot;, had made a reference to the New York City High School of Performing Arts. The musical inspired him to create a story detailing how ambition and rejection influence the lives of adolescent students. In 1977, De Silva travelled to Florida, where he met playwright Christopher Gore. He paid Gore $5,000 to draft a script titled &quot;Hot Lunch&quot;, and provided story ideas involving the plot and characters. De Silva took the project to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which acquired the script for $400,000.

Director Alan Parker received the script after the release of his previous film &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978). He met with De Silva in New York City where the two agreed that Parker would draft his own script, with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit. Parker also enlisted his colleague Alan Marshall as a producer. Gore travelled to London where he and Parker began work on a second draft, which was significantly darker than what De Silva had intended. De Silva explained, &quot;I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [Parker] was really much more interested in where the pain was in going to the school, and so we had our little conflicts based on that area.&quot;

Parker signed on as the film&#x27;s director in February 1979, and relocated to Greenwich, Connecticut, to begin pre-production. While working on the script, he interacted with many of the students attending the Performing Arts school. Several of them invited Parker to attend a midnight screening of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975) at the 8th Street Playhouse. Parker attended a weekend screening with Marshall, and the enthusiastic crowd inspired him to write a similar scene for the film, during which the character Doris Finsecker dances along to the &quot;Time Warp&quot; musical number. During filming, Parker noticed that a pornographic film showing on 42nd Street was titled &quot;Hot Lunch&quot;, and was informed that the title was &quot;New York slang for oral sex.&quot; In response, MGM offered several working titles before Parker named the film &quot;Fame&quot; after the 1975 song performed by David Bowie.

===Casting===
Although Parker had promised to hold auditions at the High School of Performing Arts, the school was initially advised by the Board of Education to prevent the students from working on the film, fearing it would affect their studies. It was later announced that filming would occur during the summer when the students were not attending school. Parker distributed casting call advertisements at the Performing Arts school and the High School of Music &amp; Art. He and casting directors Margery Simkin and Howard Feuer spent four months of the film&#x27;s pre-production auditioning young performers. They held an open casting call at the Diplomat Hotel on 43rd Street in Manhattan where more than 2,000 people auditioned for various roles.

Of the many students that Parker met at the Performing Arts, only Laura Dean, who plays Lisa Monroe, was cast in a principal role while others were cast as extras. The school&#x27;s drama teacher Jim Moody plays as Mr. Farell, and its music teacher Jonathan Strasser appears as a conductor. Music composer and actor Albert Hague secured the role of music teacher Mr. Shorofsky, as Parker wanted a veteran musician to play the part.

Irene Cara, a former student of the school, was cast as Coco Hernandez. Parker was not impressed with Cara&#x27;s musical audition, until after her recording sessions with the film&#x27;s composer Michael Gore. Gene Anthony Ray, who plays Leroy Johnson, was also a Performing Arts student but had been expelled from the school for disruptive behavior. Simkin had discovered Ray breakdancing on a street corner in Harlem before asking him to audition for a role in the film.

Lee Curreri, who was cast as Bruno Martelli, learned of the production while attending the Manhattan School of Music. During his audition, Paul McCrane performed an original song he had written, &quot;Is It Okay If I Call You Mine?&quot;. He was cast as Montgomery MacNeil, and the song inspired Parker to include it in the film. Barry Miller, who achieved critical acclaim for his supporting role in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), was cast as Ralph Garci, an aspiring actor and standup comic of Puerto Rican descent.

Maureen Teefy, an established actress of Irish descent, was cast as Doris Finsecker, a shy and uptight Jewish girl. De Silva disagreed with her casting, stating, &quot;... I&#x27;d envisioned [Doris] as a 16-or 17-year-old Barbra Streisand from Brooklyn, and when [Parker] cast this Irish actress that was a trouble ... that was my only reservation; I really had envisioned she was a young Barbra Streisand, a Jewish girl.&quot; Parker and the casting department had difficulty finding an actress for the role of Hilary Van Doren. Antonia Franceschi, who was previously a background dancer in &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), secured the role based on the strength of her audition. Meg Tilly appears in her acting debut as a dancer. In his first credited screen role, Peter Rafelson, son of Bob Rafelson, plays as a musician and vocalist.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on July 9, 1979, with a budget of $8.5 million. Parker described shooting in New York City as a less than pleasurable experience due to the intense summer weather conditions. He also faced difficulties with U.S. labor union representatives who disapproved of the British crew members working on the film without permits. In order to gain work permits, Parker made an agreement with the unions that allowed local laborers to work on the film.

During filming, the crew and several cast members objected to cinematographer Michael Seresin and camera operator John Stanier&#x27;s European style of single-source lighting, which involved the use of smoke from incense burners to diffuse the light. In response, representatives of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) halted the production, and forbade Parker from using smoke on the set.

The filmmakers had originally planned to shoot the film at the Performing Arts school, but were denied by the Board of Education over the content of the script. After consulting with Nancy Littlefield, the head of the New York City Mayor&#x27;s Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, Parker was granted a meeting with the Board&#x27;s members, who explained that they were concerned with the script&#x27;s profanity, sexual content and depictions of drug use, as well as his depiction of Turkish prisons in &quot;Midnight Express&quot;. After the filmmakers expressed interest in moving the production to Chicago, Littlefield reviewed abandoned-city properties and discovered two unused schools, Haaren High School and Performance Space 122. Both schools were converted and used for all the interior scenes. MGM spent approximately $200,000 transforming Haaren High into a sound stage, with carpentry shops and production offices. The location was used to shoot the film&#x27;s finale, a graduation ceremony. The sequence was filmed in four days, and employed 400 extras and 150 student musicians.

The exterior of the school was shot using the left wing of the then-abandoned Church of Saint Mary the Virgin building almost directly opposite the real school on West 46th Street in Times Square. &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; midnight screening sequence was filmed at the 8th Street Playhouse located on 52 West 8th Street, New York. Sal Piro, president of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; Fan Club, appears as an emcee at the screening. Parker later hired Steadicam inventor and operator Garrett Brown to film Doris and Ralph&#x27;s dialogue scene in a New York City Subway station. Montgomery MacNeil&#x27;s apartment was located on 1564 Broadway, at West 46th Street in Manhattan.

The &quot;Fame&quot; musical number was filmed on 46th Street in three days, with eight choreographed routines, 150 student background actors and 50 professional dancers. The dancers performed to the Donna Summer song &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;, as the song &quot;Fame&quot; had not yet been written. Before the sequence was filmed, Stanier left the production for personal reasons. During filming, Seresin chose to operate the camera himself for several hours before International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) representatives visited the set, and advised Parker that a cinematographer was forbidden to operate a camera, and that the production would be shut down permanently if he did not hire an operator from their union. The following day, the New York Police Department demanded that the cast and crew take a 4:00 p.m. curfew due to complaints of traffic blockages. In addition, the dancers demanded extra pay for performing stunts on top of taxicabs. Principal photography concluded after 91 days.

===Music===

The music was composed by Michael Gore. Parker had originally approached Giorgio Moroder, who had previously worked on &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, and Jeff Lynne, the lead performer of Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), both of whom had declined. The musical numbers were performed practically on set, as Parker wanted to avoid dubbing during post-production. The song &quot;Hot Lunch Jam&quot; was heavily improvised. Parker explained, &quot;This song evolved from an all day session involving groups of kids from all disciplines, as we cobbled together the song with everyone chipping in their contributions.&quot; The filming of the &quot;Fame&quot; musical number inspired Gore to write an original song inspired by Donna Summer. He and lyricist Dean Pitchford spent one month writing the lyrics. Pitchford improvised the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;m gonna live forever&quot;, inspired by a line of dialogue from the 1964 play &quot;Dylan&quot;. During the recording sessions, Luther Vandross acted as the song&#x27;s contractor, in charge of the backup vocals. He improvised the lyrics &quot;Remember, remember, remember&quot;, and performed it with backing vocalists Vivian Cherry and Vicki Sue Robinson. The song was later incorporated into the filmed dance sequence during post-production.

Parker wanted the film to end with a huge musical number that would showcase every character. While drafting the script during pre-production, he was partially inspired by the ELO song, &quot;Eldorado&quot;. Parker turned to Gore and Pitchford, requesting that they write a song would combine the film&#x27;s three musical elements: gospel, rock and classical. The resulting song, &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;, was named by Pitchford after the same-titled poem from Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; collection.

==Release==
&quot;Fame&quot; premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre on May 12, 1980. MGM issued a platform release which involved opening the film in select cities for limited showings, before releasing it nationwide. The studio was concerned with the film&#x27;s cast of then-unknown actors, and felt that the limited theatrical run would generate strong word-of-mouth support from critics and audiences. On May 16, 1980, &quot;Fame&quot; premiered at the Cinerama Dome Theatre in Hollywood, and opened in limited release in New York, Toronto and Los Angeles. MGM spent more than $2 million on an advertising campaign which placed emphasis on the film&#x27;s music. The studio also allowed select theatre chains to give out free tickets for special screenings. &quot;Fame&quot; was released nationwide on June 20, 1980, distributed by MGM through United Artists. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $21,202,829, and was the thirty-second highest-grossing film of 1980. By April 1981, the film had grossed $20.4 million overseas and was expected to gross $29 million, giving it a worldwide gross of between $42-$50 million.

===Home media===
&quot;Fame&quot; was released on VHS, Laserdisc, and CED videodisc in March 1981, by MGM/CBS Home Video. In 1986, the distribution rights to the film were transferred to Turner Entertainment Co., which acquired MGM&#x27;s pre-May 1986 library of feature films. Currently, the rights are owned by Warner Bros., after its parent company Time Warner acquired Turner&#x27;s library of MGM films in 1996. The film was released on DVD on June 3, 2003, by Warner Home Video. Special features for the DVD include an audio commentary by Parker, a branching video featuring interviews with Parker and several cast members, a making-of featurette, a short documentary on the High School of Performing Arts, production notes, and the theatrical trailer. As a tie-in to the home video release of MGM&#x27;s 2009 remake, Warner Home Video released the film on Blu-ray on January 26, 2010. The Blu-ray presents the film in 1080p high definition, and contains all the additional materials found on the 2003 DVD release, including a CD &quot;soundtrack sampler&quot; that previews four musical numbers from the soundtrack album.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Fame&quot; holds an approval rating of 81% based on 37 reviews, with an average score of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Just because &quot;Fame&quot; is a well-acted musical doesn&#x27;t mean it flinches against its surprisingly heavy topics.&quot; Although initial reactions among film critics were mixed, Barry Miller received critical acclaim for his performance. Jack Matthews of the Associated Press wrote &quot;Barry Miller bolts from the screen with a performance that will etch itself into the viewer&#x27;s mind for a long time to come&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, &quot;When the kids perform, the movie sings, but their fictionalized personal stories are melodramatic drivel.&quot; Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote, &quot;The film is cut at such a frenzied pitch that it&#x27;s often possible to believe (mistakenly) that something significant is going on.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;The great strength of the film is in the school scenes – when it wanders away from the scholastic side as it does with increasing frequency as the overlong feature moves along, it loses dramatic intensity and slows the pace.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four writing, &quot;&quot;Fame&quot; is a genuine treasure, moving and entertaining, a movie that understands being a teen-ager as well as &quot;Breaking Away&quot; did, but studies its characters in a completely different milieu.&quot; William Gallagher, in his review for the BBC, wrote, &quot;Alan Parker manages to make this a fairly horrible story even while it remains entertaining. You come away from it with all your preconceptions about the glamour of showbusiness wiped away and you can&#x27;t help but admire the characters who get through.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Franchise==
Following the film&#x27;s release, a television spin-off, &quot;Fame&quot;, aired on the NBC network for two seasons from January 7, 1982, to August 4, 1983. The series was then renewed for first-run syndication, and four additional seasons were produced. Returning cast members from the film included Lee Curreri, Albert Hague, Gene Anthony Ray and Debbie Allen. The show&#x27;s popularity, particularly in the United Kingdom, led to the formation of a music group, The Kids from &quot;Fame&quot;. The main vocalists were Allen, Ray, Curerri, Valerie Landsburg, Erica Gimpel, Carlo Imperato, and Lori Singer. In 1982, the band released two albums, &quot;The Kids from &quot;Fame&quot;&quot; and &quot;The Kids from &quot;Fame&quot; Again&quot;, which were largely successful in the United Kingdom. The band members also went on tour, performing as their characters live on stage. After the series was renewed, The Kids from &quot;Fame&quot; produced three additional albums, all of which proved less successful and resulted in the band members parting ways to pursue other projects. As the series had been in production at the time of MGM&#x27;s spinoff from Turner Entertainment, MGM retained the rights to the &quot;Fame&quot; intellectual property.

In 1987, producer David De Silva announced he was developing a stage version of the film. &quot;Fame: The Musical&quot; was the first professional production at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami in 1988. The show then played at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia from March 25 through April 29, 1989. The musical has since been produced in over 25 countries.

In 1997, MGM Television produced a second series inspired by the film. &quot;Fame L.A.&quot;, created by Richard B. Lewis, focused on the lives of several students attending a drama and dance school in Los Angeles. The series featured Christian Kane, Roselyn Sánchez, William R. Moses, and Lesli Margherita in starring roles. It aired in syndication from October 19, 1997, to March 21, 1998.

In 2002, MGM and Touchstone Television planned to develop a two-hour television film that would serve as a direct sequel to &quot;Fame&quot;, followed by a spin-off television series. Both projects were to be produced for the ABC network. The television film was to introduce several students applying for positions at the New York City of Performing Arts, while the spin-off series would focus on their lives during their four years of attending the school. The series would feature new cast members as the young students, as well as those from the 1980 film, as well as updated versions of the songs &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Out Here on My Own&quot;. Michael Gore was to act as an executive producer for both projects with his producing partner Lawrence Cohen, through their production label White Cap Productions. However, both television projects were never produced.

In 2003, MGM Television produced a reality television series titled &quot;Fame&quot;, in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the largely popular &quot;American Idol&quot;. The concept of the series involves discovering a &quot;triple threat&quot;—a person who can sing, act and dance and has a &quot;bigger-than-life&quot; personality. The show, co-hosted by Debbie Allen, and Joey Fatone, featured Carnie Wilson, Johnny Wright and JoJo Wright as the panel of judges. The series premiered on NBC on May 28, 2003, and a total of ten episode were produced. The two competing finalists of the series were Shannon Bex and Harlemm Lee. Lee emerged as the winner of the competition, based on home-audience votes.

In 2012, MGM Television announced it would produce a modern-day television series inspired by the film, with Nigel Lythgoe acting as an executive producer. The project resurfaced in June 2015, when &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that MGM Television would be co-producing the series with A&amp;E Networks for Lifetime, with Josh Safran attached as the show&#x27;s writer and executive producer.

===Remake===
In 2009, MGM and Lakeshore Entertainment produced a remake of &quot;Fame&quot; directed by Kevin Tancharoen, and written by Allison Burnett. The remake followed the premise of the original film, depicting the lives of several students as they attend the New York City High School of Performing Arts. Debbie Allen was the only cast member from the 1980 film to have a supporting role, appearing as the school&#x27;s principal. The film was notable for its lighter tone, in contrast to the earlier film&#x27;s gritty subject matter. Released on September 25, 2009, &quot;Fame&quot; received generally unfavorable reviews from mainstream film critics. It was a modest box office success upon release in the United States, though it fared better internationally, grossing $54.7 million worldwide. Parker voiced his disapproval of the remake and described it as an &quot;awful&quot; film. Maureen Teefy also criticized the film, stating, &quot;They&#x27;re using the same formula, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same substance. It&#x27;s not staying true to the grittiness and authenticity of the original.&quot;

===Future===
In April 2023, after previously acquiring MGM, Amazon announced plans to expand the franchise with television series in development from Amazon Studios.

==Aftermath and legacy==
&quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Pennies From Heaven&quot; were the last films to be produced by MGM, before the studio merged with United Artists in 1981. The film has been credited with revitalizing the teen musical subgenre by adding dramatic elements into its story, echoing 1950s melodramas. Its presentation of musical numbers in the style of a music video was a major influence on other 1980s films in the dance film genre, such as &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), &quot;Footloose&quot; (1984) and &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (1987). It also inspired the creation of other similar performing arts schools around the world, including the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA), and the BRIT School.

The film and its title song helped launch Irene Cara&#x27;s musical career. She recorded three solo albums and contributed to several film soundtracks, notably performing &quot;Flashdance...What a Feeling&quot;, the title song for &quot;Flashdance&quot;, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Paul McCrane, Meg Tilly, and Barry Miller (who won the Tony Award in 1985 for Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;) went on to successful acting careers, while Gene Anthony Ray, Debbie Allen and Lee Curerri found success and popularity with the television series.

Ray struggled with drug and alcohol addictions, and worked sporadically after the series ended in 1987. In 1996, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive and died after a stroke on November 14, 2003.

The film was Christopher Gore&#x27;s only original screenplay. He was also involved with the 1982 television series as its creator, and wrote several episodes before his death from AIDS on May 18, 1988.

After &quot;Fame&quot;, Louis Falco continued to work as a commercial choreographer for several music videos and films. He again collaborated with Parker on the 1987 film &quot;Angel Heart&quot; before his death from AIDS on March 26, 1993.

In 2004, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked the song &quot;Fame&quot; at #51 on its &quot;100 Years...100 Songs&quot; list. In 2006, AFI placed the film on its &quot;100 Years...100 Cheers&quot; list, where it was ranked #92. The film also ranked #42 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot;. In 2014, &quot;IndieWire&quot; added the song &quot;Fame&quot; to its list of &quot;The 20 Greatest Movie Theme Songs of the 1980s&quot;.

In 2023, the film was selected for preservation to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress after being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Dian Wei (; died February or March 197) was a military general serving under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. Famed for his enormous strength, Dian Wei excelled at wielding a pair of &quot;ji&quot;s (a halberd-like weapon), each of which was said to weigh 40 &quot;jin&quot;. He was killed in action at the Battle of Wancheng while covering Cao Cao&#x27;s escape from Zhang Xiu&#x27;s forces.

==Background==
Dian Wei was from Jiwu County (), Chenliu Commandery (), in present-day Ningling County, Henan. He was described as a stalwart man with great strength and the ambition of becoming a &quot;youxia&quot; (vigilante).

==Assassinating Li Yong==
When he was young, Dian Wei once agreed to help a certain Liu family in Xiangyi County (襄邑縣; present-day Sui County, Henan) take revenge against one Li Yong (). As Li Yong was a former county chief, he had bodyguards to protect him during his travels.

Dian Wei disguised himself as a marquis and travelled to Li Yong&#x27;s house in a carriage filled with food and wine. He entered the house without challenge, stabbed Li Yong with a concealed dagger, and killed Li Yong&#x27;s wife as well. He then left the house and retrieved his weapons (a sword and a &quot;ji&quot;) from the carriage and walked away. As Li Yong lived near the marketplace, news of his death spread quickly and the whole town was shocked. Hundreds of men went to pursue the murderer but none of them dared to approach Dian Wei. After travelling four or five &quot;li&quot; on foot, Dian Wei met his companions and they escaped after a brief fight with the pursuers. Dian Wei became recognised as a hero after this incident.

==Service under Cao Cao==
Around February or March 190, when the regional official Zhang Miao was rallying an army to join the campaign against Dong Zhuo, Dian Wei answered the call and became a subordinate of Zhao Chong (), a military officer serving under Zhang Miao. Once, a large banner was swaying in the strong wind and many men could not stop it from swaying despite their combined efforts. Dian Wei used only one hand to grab the banner pole and succeeded in keeping it upright. Zhao Chong was very impressed with Dian Wei&#x27;s strength.

Dian Wei later became a subordinate of Xiahou Dun, a general under the warlord Cao Cao. He was promoted to the rank of Major () for his valour in battle.

===Battle of Puyang===
Around September 194, when Cao Cao was at war with a rival warlord Lü Bu in Yan Province, he launched a surprise night raid on one of Lü Bu&#x27;s camps located 40-50 &quot;li&quot; west of Puyang County and destroyed it before dawn. Just as Cao Cao and his troops were planning to return to their base, Lü Bu personally led reinforcements from Puyang County to attack them and caught them in an onrush.

Dian Wei ordered dozens of men to gather around him, put on two layers of armour, discard their shields and arm themselves only with spears and &quot;ji&quot;s. Another wave of enemy soldiers closing in from the west unleashed a barrage of arrows onto Dian Wei and his men. Dian Wei remained oblivious to the arrows and told his men, &quot;Let me know when the enemy is ten paces away.&quot; The men did so. Dian Wei then said again, &quot;Let me know when they are five paces away.&quot; The men then suddenly cried out in fear, &quot;The enemy is upon us!&quot; Dian Wei was holding on to a dozen &quot;ji&quot;s, and he flung them at the enemy when they approached him. Each &quot;ji&quot; knocked down an enemy soldier and not a single one missed its target.

As the sun rose, Lü Bu retreated back to Puyang while Cao Cao withdrew back to his base as well. Cao Cao was so impressed with Dian Wei that he promoted him to the rank of Commandant () and put him in command of hundreds of his personal bodyguards who patrolled the areas around his tent.

===As Cao Cao&#x27;s bodyguard===
Dian Wei was a robustly built fighter. He personally selected the soldiers who would serve under him. In battle, Dian Wei and his men were always the first to charge into the enemy formation. Dian Wei was later promoted to the rank of Colonel ().

Dian Wei was known for being a loyal, prudent and responsible man. He often stood guard outside Cao Cao&#x27;s tent from morning until dusk, and even at night he would sleep beside Cao Cao&#x27;s tent, and he rarely returned to his own quarters. He was also a heavy eater and drinker, eating in huge mouthfuls and drinking in long gulps. Because of his enormous appetite, several men were required to serve him whenever he sat down for meals. Cao Cao was very impressed with him.

Dian Wei&#x27;s weapons of choice were a pair of &quot;ji&quot;s or long swords. There was a saying in Cao Cao&#x27;s army about Dian Wei: &quot;In our camp resides the warrior Dian Wei, who wields a pair of &quot;ji&quot;s weighing 80 &quot;jin&quot; in total.&quot;

===Death at the Battle of Wancheng===

In February 197, Cao Cao invaded Wancheng (宛城; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan) in the north of Jing Province. Wancheng was the territory of the warlord Zhang Xiu, who immediately surrendered upon learning of Cao Cao&#x27;s invasion. Cao Cao was pleased so he threw a party for Zhang Xiu and his men. During the party, Dian Wei stood guard behind Cao Cao, holding a giant battle axe whose blade was one &quot;chi&quot; long. Zhang Xiu and his followers did not dare to look up when they toasted to Cao Cao.

Cao Cao had stayed in Wancheng for more than 10 days when Zhang Xiu suddenly rebelled and launched a surprise attack on his camp. Cao Cao was caught unprepared so he retreated with a few horsemen.

Dian Wei stood guard at the entrance to the camp and prevented Zhang Xiu&#x27;s soldiers from advancing further. The enemy then scattered and broke into Cao Cao&#x27;s camp from the other entrances. Dian Wei had about a dozen men with him and they were all heavily outnumbered by Zhang Xiu&#x27;s forces. However, Dian Wei fought bravely with a long &quot;ji&quot;, and with each swing of his weapon, he broke more than ten enemy spears. As the battle went on, Dian Wei&#x27;s men were eventually all killed and Dian himself had sustained several wounds all over his body, but he continued fighting the enemy at close quarters with short weapons. Dian Wei grabbed two enemies and killed them, and the others did not dare to approach him. Dian Wei then rushed forward and slew several more enemy soldiers before eventually succumbing to his wounds. Just before his death, he was still glaring and swearing at the enemy. Only after confirming that Dian Wei was dead did the enemies dare to come forward and decapitate him. Dian Wei&#x27;s head was passed around for Zhang Xiu&#x27;s men to see. They also came to look at his headless body.

By then, Cao Cao had already retreated safely to Wuyin County (舞陰縣; southeast of present-day Sheqi County, Henan), and he broke down in tears when he heard of Dian Wei&#x27;s death. He ordered his men to retrieve Dian Wei&#x27;s body and personally attended the funeral and had Dian Wei buried in Xiangyi County (襄邑縣; present-day Sui County, Henan). Later, whenever Cao Cao passed by Dian Wei&#x27;s grave, he would stop to pay his respects and mourn Dian Wei.

==Family==
Cao Cao appointed Dian Wei&#x27;s son, Dian Man (), as a &quot;langzhong&quot; (). Cao Cao missed Dian Wei later so he promoted Dian Man to Major () and kept Dian Man close to him. After Cao Cao died in March 220, his son Cao Pi appointed Dian Man as a Commandant () and granted him the title of a Secondary Marquis ().

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Dian Wei appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period.

Dian Wei first appeared in Chapter 10, and he was first introduced by Xiahou Dun to Cao Cao sometime in 193. According to Xiahou Dun, Dian Wei used to serve Zhang Miao but he could not get along well with Zhang&#x27;s men, and he once killed tens of men before fleeing into the hills. While Xiahou Dun was out hunting, he saw Dian Wei chasing a deer across a stream and he brought the man back to his lord. Xiahou Dun continued to tell Cao Cao about Dian Wei&#x27;s background and physical prowess. Cao Cao then asked Dian Wei to demonstrate his skills. At that time, a huge banner was swaying in the wind and was on the verge of collapsing. Many of Cao Cao&#x27;s men were unable to keep the banner upright even with their combined efforts. Dian Wei shouted at them to move back and he grabbed the banner pole with one hand and kept it steady. Cao Cao exclaimed, &quot;This is Elai of ancient times!&quot; Dian Wei then became a Commandant under Cao Cao.

Dian Wei&#x27;s death at the Battle of Wancheng is described in greater detail in Chapter 16 but is more exaggerated than his historical biography. In this exaggeration, it was mentioned that Dian Wei was able to pick up the dead bodies of enemies by their feet and swing them as a means of attack before he was finally killed by raining arrows and piercing spears. At Dian Wei&#x27;s funeral, Cao Cao wept and told his followers, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel very sad over the loss of my eldest son (Cao Ang) and my favourite nephew (Cao Anmin). I&#x27;m only mourning Dian Wei!&quot;

==In popular culture==
Dian Wei appears as a character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;, and &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; video game series. He also appears in Chan Mou&#x27;s manhua series &quot;The Ravages of Time&quot;, a retelling of the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

Dian Wei appears alongside &quot;Xu Chu&quot; as a guardian spirit of General Cao Yanbing in the anime and drama series Rakshasa Street.

<doc id="639633" wikidata="Q550510" url="?curid=639633" title="Fame (Irene Cara song)">
<text>&quot;Fame&quot; is a song written by Michael Gore (music) and Dean Pitchford (lyrics) and released in 1980, that achieved chart success as the theme song to the &quot;Fame&quot; film and TV series. The song was performed by Irene Cara, who played the role of Coco Hernandez in the original film. It was also her debut single as a recording artist. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1980, and the Golden Globe Award the same year. In 2004, it finished at number 51 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.

== History ==
Irene Cara played the role of Coco Hernandez in the movie &quot;Fame&quot; and sang the vocals for the theme song. The music for the song was by Michael Gore and the lyrics were by Dean Pitchford. The song earned Cara a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The movie became an &quot;overnight sensation&quot;. The song won an Oscar for best film theme song in 1981. In July 1982, it was re-released on the back of the successful TV series and topped the charts in several countries, including the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

== &quot;Fame&quot; theme song ==
The song was later used as the theme song for the &quot;Fame&quot; television series, which aired from 1982 to 1987. For seasons 1-4, the song was performed by Erica Gimpel who played Cara&#x27;s character, Coco, on the show. For seasons 5-6, it was performed by Loretta Chandler. The song was also used in other TV shows related to &quot;Fame&quot;.

<doc id="639634" wikidata="Q3792787" url="?curid=639634" title="Sargo-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarines were among the first United States submarines to be sent into action after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, starting war patrols the day after the attack, having been deployed to the Philippines in late 1941. Similar to the previous , they were built between 1937 and 1939. With a top speed of 21 knots, a range of (allowing patrols in Japanese home waters), and a reliable propulsion plant, along with the &quot;Salmon&quot;s they were an important step in the development of a true fleet submarine. In some references, the &quot;Salmon&quot;s and &quot;Sargo&quot;s are called the &quot;New S Class&quot;, 1st and 2nd Groups.

The &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarine had the distinction of being the first US Navy submarine to sink a Japanese ship in World War II.

==Design==

In most features the &quot;Sargo&quot;s were a repeat of the &quot;Salmon&quot;s, except for the return to full diesel-electric drive for the last four boats and the adoption of the improved &quot;Sargo&quot; battery design. The first six &quot;Sargo&quot;s were driven by a composite direct-drive and diesel-electric plant (two engines in each mode) in the same manner as the &quot;Salmon&quot;s. In this arrangement, two main engines in the forward engine room drove generators. In the after engine room, two side-by-side engines were clutched to reduction gears which sat forward of the engines, with vibration-isolating hydraulic clutches. Two high-speed electric motors, driven by the generating engines or batteries, were also connected to each reduction gear. The Bureau of Steam Engineering (BuEng) and the General Board desired a full diesel-electric plant, but there were some dissenting opinions, notably Admiral Thomas C. Hart, the only experienced submariner on the General Board, who pointed out that a full diesel-electric system could be disabled by flooding. Technical problems went against the use of two large direct-drive diesels in place of the four-engine composite plant. No engine of suitable power to reach the desired 21-knot speed existed in the US, and the current vibration-isolating hydraulic clutches were not capable of transmitting enough power. It was also not practical to gear two engines to each shaft. So a full diesel-electric plant was adopted for the last four &quot;Sargo&quot;s, and remained standard for all subsequent conventionally-powered US submarines.

Four of the class (&quot;Sargo&quot;, &quot;Saury&quot;, &quot;Spearfish&quot;, and &quot;Seadragon&quot;) were equipped with the troublesome Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (HOR) double-acting diesels. An attempt to produce more power from a smaller engine than other contemporary designs, the double-acting system proved unreliable in service. During World War II, all had their engines replaced with GM Cleveland Diesel 16-278A engines, probably during their overhauls in early 1943.

BuEng had designed a new lead-acid battery to resist battle damage, known as the &quot;Sargo&quot; battery because it was first installed on and was based on a suggestion by her commissioning commanding officer, Lieutenant E. E. Yeomans. Instead of a single hard rubber case, it had two concentric hard rubber cases with a layer of soft rubber between them. This was to prevent sulfuric acid leakage in the event one case cracked during depth-charging. This remained the standard battery design until replaced with Sargo II and GUPPY batteries in submarines upgraded under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program after World War II. Each battery&#x27;s capacity was slightly increased by installing 126 cells instead of 120; this also raised the nominal voltage from 250 volts to 270 volts, which has been standard in US usage ever since, including the backup batteries of nuclear submarines.

The original Mark 21 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber deck gun proved to be too light in service. It lacked sufficient punch to finish off crippled or small targets quickly enough to suit the crews. It was replaced by the Mark 9 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber gun in 1943-44, in most cases removed from an S-boat being transferred to training duty.

From commissioning until late 1941 the first six &quot;Sargo&quot;s were based first at San Diego, later at Pearl Harbor. The last four were sent to the Philippines shortly after commissioning. In October 1941, the remaining &quot;Sargo&quot;s and most other newer available submarines were transferred to the Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines as part of a belated effort to reinforce U.S. and Allied forces in Southeast Asia. The Japanese occupation of southern Indo-China and the August 1941 American-British-Dutch retaliatory oil embargo had raised international tensions.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the submarines of the Asiatic Fleet were the primary striking force available to Admiral Thomas C. Hart, the fleet&#x27;s commander. He was assigned sixteen &quot;Salmon&quot;s or &quot;Sargo&quot;s; the entirety of both classes. Seven &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class and six S-boats rounded out the force. The Japanese did not bomb the Philippines until 10 December 1941, so almost all of the submarines were able to get underway before an attack. &quot;Sealion&quot; and &quot;Seadragon&quot; were the unlucky exceptions. In overhaul at the Cavite Navy Yard, &quot;Sealion&quot; was damaged beyond repair and was scuttled on 25 December. &quot;Seadragon&quot;, assisted by and , was able to leave port with emergency repairs and went on to fight for most of the war.

The &quot;Sargo&quot; class was very active during the war, sinking 73 ships, including a Japanese submarine. Four were lost, including one to &quot;friendly fire&quot;.

 of this class sank the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Chūyō&quot;, which was carrying 21 survivors from the submarine ; only one of these prisoners survived the sinking. &quot;Sculpin&quot; had been one of the ships assisting in the rescue of 33 men when sank during a test dive in 1939; &quot;Squalus&quot; was refloated and recommissioned as .

In early 1945 the surviving boats of this class were transferred to training roles for the remainder of the war, eventually being scrapped in 1947-48. was used in the Bikini Atoll atomic weapon tests in 1946. There was negligible damage so she was later expended as a target in 1948. &quot;Sailfish&quot; was also due to become a target in the same atomic weapon tests but she was scrapped instead in 1948.

<doc id="639637" wikidata="Q4259423" url="?curid=639637" title="Nathan Cavaleri">
<text>Nathan Cavaleri (born 18 June 1982) is an Australian blues rock singer-songwriter and guitarist, and a former child actor. He issued two albums as a solo artist, &quot;Jammin&#x27; with the Cats&quot; (1993) and &quot;Nathan&quot; (1994). He has been a member of various groups including Dirty Skanks (2003–2010), and Nat Col and the Kings (2010–2012). At the age of six Cavaleri was diagnosed with leukaemia and has been in remission since he was 13. As a child actor he appeared in the American film &quot;Camp Nowhere&quot; (1994) and starred in &quot;Paws&quot; (1997).

==Biography==
===1982–1992: early years===
Nathan Cavaleri was born on 18 June 1982 and grew up in Ruse, New South Wales. His father, Frank Cavaleri, was a bricklayer and part-time guitarist; his mother is Joanne, and the couple also have a younger son. Cavaleri began playing guitar at the age of five; he began by using a full-sized guitar with a shaved neck, which was done to accommodate his smaller hands.

Cavaleri was diagnosed with leukaemia at age six; he continued playing guitar to take his mind off the disease. He received chemotherapy treatment and, by May 1993, he was in remission. He asked the Australian branch of Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation, a charity organisation, to fulfil his wish – at the age of nine he played with Mark Knopfler; he described Cavaleri&#x27;s playing as &quot;unbelievable&quot;. Knopfler also donated a gold plaque awarded to his group, Dire Straits, for their album &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; (1985).

Regarded as a child prodigy, Cavaleri was later trained by, and at age thirteen, eventually toured with, B.B. King. King described Cavaleri as &quot;the future of the blues&quot;. In May 1992 Cavaleri released his debut single, &quot;Little Egypt&quot;, which was a cover version of Elvis Presley&#x27;s track from 1964, and peaked at No. 63 in Australia. Its B-side, &quot;Nat&#x27;s Blues&quot;, was co-written by Cavaleri with his father, Frank.

===1993–1995: &quot;Jammin&#x27; with the Cats&quot; &amp; &quot;Nathan&quot;===
On 12 April 1993 he issued his debut album, &quot;Jammin&#x27; with the Cats&quot;, on Little Rock/Mushroom Records, which was produced by &quot;Buzz&quot; Bidstrup (Riptides, GANGgajang, The Sunnyboys). Bevan Hannan of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; described Cavaleri as a &quot;super guitar technician&quot; and felt the album &quot;range[s] from shuffle, blues and jazz to out and out rock. It is the type of music you would expect to hear on a tonight chat show.&quot; For the album he worked with Jimmy Barnes, Diesel and Tommy Emmanuel. It peaked at No. 33 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

In September 1993 Cavaleri and Barnes released a cover version of the La De Da&#x27;s&#x27; single, &quot;Gonna See My Baby Tonight&quot;, from November 1971. Fifty thousand promotional copies were included as give-aways in Uncle Tobys breakfast cereal boxes. Barnes provided lead vocals, rhythm guitar and produced the track, Bidstrup was on drums, Michael Hegerty on bass guitar and Jeff Neill on rhythm guitar and backing vocals.

For his second album, &quot;Nathan&quot; (1994), he used Teddy Andreadis on keyboards, Curt Bisquera on drums, Jeff Berlin on bass guitar, Randy Jacobs on guitar and Sweet Pea Atkinson and Andrew Strong. AllMusic&#x27;s Erik Crawford noted that &quot;he delivers jaw-dropping solos on track after track&quot; as he &quot;offers up an earthy blues effort that fits nicely alongside other teen blues sensations.&quot; The album provided two singles, &quot;Workin&#x27; on It&quot; (September 1994, No. 55 in Australia) and &quot;(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Right&quot; (March 1995). For its United States release, Cavaleri signed with Epic Records and Michael Jackson&#x27;s label, MJJ Music.

He has played with Robben Ford, and Aaron Neville, An instrumental version of his song &quot;Lou&#x27;s Blues&quot; is featured in the film &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot;, and he has served as a spokesman for Peavey Guitars.

===1996–2002: hiatus===
Cavaleri finished secondary school in the mid 1990s, paused his musical career and became a brickie&#x27;s labourer.

On 18 October 2000 Cavaleri performed during the Opening Ceremony of the 11th Paralympic Games in Sydney.

Cavaleri reflected on his early career said in 2004, &quot;When I was doing all of that stuff (it) doesn&#x27;t even feel like it was my life ... It feels like a haze. It feels like a dream. It just feels like images in the head, almost like a western movie.&quot; &quot;I just totally escaped music ... It can be a dark time when you’re finding yourself creatively.&quot;

===2003–2012: Dirty Skanks &amp; Nat Col and the Kings===
In 2003 he formed a group, Dirty Skanks, with Col Hatchman on drums, then a member of The Screaming Jets. Dirty Skanks released the album &quot;Voluptuosity&quot; on Jaynie Records in 2004.

By 2010 Dirty Skanks was renamed as Nat Col and the Kings. Cavaleri writes and arranges his own material as the group tours, by 2012 the line-up included Toni Bird on backing vocals and Kenny Jewell on bass guitar. Nat Col and the Kings released three EPs in 2010, 2011, and 2012 on Jaynie Records.

===2012–2018: health concerns===
By 2012 Cavaleri started having health concerns and noticed he was getting panic attacks before gigs. Cavaleri got through a few more gigs but soon decided he did not want to keep on touring. He suffered serious insomnia, anxiety and depression. Cavaleri met with doctors who suggested medication, but he instead adopted a more holistic approach; completing a mindfulness course, visiting a psychologist regularly, meeting a clinical nutritionist and exploring integrated medicine. He undertook activities away from music, like surfing and meditation.

At the start of 2016, Cavaleri quietly made his return to the stage for the first time in three and a half years, performing one song with Kenny Jewell at a local gig. This performance reignited Cavaleri&#x27;s passion for music.

===2018–2021: relaunch of career and &quot;Demons&quot;===
2019 saw Nathan Cavaleri return to the stage after a 5-year struggle with anxiety/depression.

In October 2019, Cavaleri released the 4-track EP &quot;Demons&quot;. All four tracks were released as singles, with the single &quot;29 Gold Stars&quot; receiving rave reviews from triple j, double j, MusicFeeds and PileRats.

In 2020, three more singles were released, before a forthcoming studio album, also titled &quot;Demons&quot;, set for release on 6 August 2020.

=== 2022–present: &quot;Miracles&quot;===

In April 2023, Cavaleri announced the forthcoming release of his fourth studio album, &quot;Miracles&quot;. The album is scheduled for released on 16 June 2023.

<text>&quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; is a song by American pop rock duo the Rembrandts. The song was written by David Crane, Marta Kauffman and Allee Willis as the main theme song to the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, which was broadcast from 1994 to 2004. American rock band R.E.M. was originally asked to allow their song &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; to be used for the &quot;Friends&quot; theme, but they turned the opportunity down. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; was subsequently written and Warner Bros. Television selected the only available band on Warner Bros. Records to record it: the Rembrandts. In 1995, after a Nashville radio station brought the song to mainstream popularity, Rembrandts members Danny Wilde and Phil Sōlem expanded the theme song with two new verses and included this version on their third studio album, &quot;L.P.&quot; (1995).

The extended version of the song was serviced to US radio on May 23, 1995, and was issued in the United Kingdom on August 7, 1995, as the first single from &quot;L.P.&quot; Following the song&#x27;s release, it reached the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand and Norway, as well as on the Irish Singles Chart and the UK Singles Chart in both 1995 and 1997. In Canada, the song reached number one for five weeks and was the most successful single of 1995, while in the United States, the song reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart for eight weeks.

==Background and release==
The title theme used in the pilot for &quot;Friends&quot; was &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; by American rock band R.E.M.. Warner Bros. Television wanted either that song, or a song by R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe as the theme for the show. When Stipe rejected the offer, the producers of the show instead wrote their own theme song and enlisted the Rembrandts, consisting of members Phil Sōlem and Danny Wilde, to record it. The music was composed by Marta Kauffman&#x27;s husband, Michael Skloff. The Rembrandts did not want to record the song, but since they were the only available band on Warner Bros. Records, they relented to the company&#x27;s demands. The original lyrics of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot;, a single verse as needed for the length of the series&#x27; opening credits, were co-written by &quot;Friends&quot; producers David Crane, and Kauffman along with songwriter Allee Willis. Skloff became inspired by hearing the Beatles song &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; on the radio while reading a show script and sought to capture a mid-1960s pop sound for the theme; though Michael Stipe speculates that the theme may have been written to emulate the sound of his band R.E.M. who were initially asked to supply the theme song. The handclaps at the end of the first line of the song were a last-minute addition, with Sōlem admitting that it was a wise decision and naming it the best part of the track.

The original theme, which is under one minute long, was later re-recorded as a three-minute pop song. After a radio announcer in Nashville, Tennessee, looped the original short version into a full-length track and broadcast it, the song became so popular that the Rembrandts had to re-record it, as well as helping to write the second verse and bridge. Sōlem said, &quot;Our record label said we had to finish the song and record it. There was no way to get out of it.&quot; The three-minute version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; was serviced to American contemporary hit radio on May 23, 1995. In the United Kingdom, a CD single and cassette single were issued on August 7, 1995. On May 12, 1997, the CD and cassette were re-issued in the UK to commemorate the video release of the first season of &quot;Friends&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; is an upbeat song about traveling, dead-end jobs, and friendship. It is written in the key of A major with a tempo of 190 beats per minute.

==Critical reception==
Mark Sutherland from &quot;NME&quot; wrote, &quot;Another record that makes you want to be American. This time it&#x27;s one of the boho twentysomethings who populate US sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, to which this is the theme. And, as such, it&#x27;s the aural equivalent of the programme: all snazzy handclaps, ever-so-slightly alternative guitars, &#x27;kooky&#x27; harmonies and lyrics that hint at existential angst but, fortunately, only the kind that can be sorted out in half an hour in front of a live studio audience. &quot;I&#x27;ll be there for you&quot;, they swoon, &quot;When the rain starts to fall&quot;. What, in October?&quot; Leesa Daniels from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; four out of five, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s quirky in a Beatles/Monkees way and it demands to be danced to in a ridiculous fashion that could possibly involve exposing your underwear. Ace!&quot; In 2009, the song was listed by &quot;Blender&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Worst Songs Ever&quot;. Conversely, several magazines have listed the song as one of the best TV theme songs, including &quot;Paste&quot;, &quot;Complex&quot;, and &quot;Observer&quot;.

==Chart performance==
&quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart for eight weeks and also peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary and Top 40/Mainstream charts. At the peak of its popularity, the song was not available as a commercial single, therefore becoming the first song to top the Hot 100 Airplay chart without appearing on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, when it was later released commercially as a double A-side with &quot;This House Is Not a Home&quot;, it reached number 17. In Canada, the song peaked at number one for five consecutive weeks and was the most successful single of 1995. In the United Kingdom, it reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and it peaked at the same position on the Irish Singles Chart the same year. In Scotland, it topped the country&#x27;s singles chart. The song sold 322,000 copies in the UK during 1995.

While the song did not immediately make a significant commercial impact in Australia, reaching number 86 in October 1995, it re-entered the ARIA Singles Chart in August 1996 and peaked at number three on the week of October 13, spending a total of 20 weeks in the top 50. In 1997, when re-released in Europe, the song reached the top 10 in Ireland and the United Kingdom once more, placing two positions shy of its number-three peak in both countries. This re-release also saw the song reach the top 40 in Flanders, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. As of May 2021, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; has sold 925,000 copies and has been streamed 20.7 million times in the UK since streaming figures were introduced in 2014. According to the Official Charts Company, the song is streamed an average of 96,000 times a week.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; features the band performing in a studio while the cast of &quot;Friends&quot; join in. Some scenes are shot in black-and-white. The Rembrandts members Phil Sōlem and Danny Wilde disclosed during a live interview on &quot;The Today Show&quot; on September 20, 2019, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the song that the video was shot on the set of &quot;SNL&quot; (Studio 8H).

<text>Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW, also known as Brew MP or Qualcomm BREW) is an obsolete application development platform created by Qualcomm, originally for code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile phones, featuring third-party applications such as mobile games. It was offered in some feature phones (mostly with specifications similar to those of mid to high-end mobile phones) as well as smartphones. First developed in 1999, as a platform for wireless applications on CDMA-based mobile phones, it debuted in September 2001. As a software platform that can download and run small programs for playing games, sending messages, and sharing photos, the main advantage of Brew MP was that the application developers could easily port their applications among all Brew MP devices by providing a standardized set of application programming interfaces. Software for Brew MP-enabled handsets can be developed in C or C++ using the freely downloadable Brew MP software development kit (SDK). The BREW runtime library is part of the wireless device on-chip firmware or operating system to allow programmers to develop applications without needing to code for system interface or understand wireless applications. BREW is described as a pseudo operating system, but not a true mobile operating system. BREW was not a virtual machine such as Java ME, as it runs code natively.

==Software==
For software developers, Brew MP was a full set of application programming interfaces (API) that enables making software and applications in C, C++, Java, and was supported (platform) by an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It has a memory footprint of about 15,900 KB (15.9 MB). From versions 1.x to 2.x (before 2004), it had a smaller memory footprint of around 60 KB. BREW also features direct hardware access. Versions before Brew MP ran/relied on REX OS (Qualcomm&#x27;s own RTOS), while Brew MP used Brew RTOS (another RTOS for advanced feature phones). Rather than using an interpreter-based code, BREW also relied on its own mobile hardware.

==Version history==

=== BREW 1.0 / 1.1 (2001–2003) ===

Debuted in 2001, it was the first actual version of BREW. Originally made for the Kyocera QCP-3035 (which was the earliest BREW-enabled phone commercially available) and Sharp Z-800. It made use of personal digital assistant-level features (usually for some applications and the ability to run BREW applications). However, it lacks advanced multimedia features and support for Java ME that were available in subsequent versions. It was the only version of BREW to support monochrome screens as support for monochrome screens was removed in BREW 2.0. BREW 1.1 was the first version of Brew to run Java ME applications. It was available in some BREW-enabled phones in 2002 and early 2003.

=== BREW 2.0 / 2.1 (2002–2009) ===
Released in the mid-2002, it was installed for most of the BREW-enabled phones in late-2002 until late-2009. It includes support for advanced multimedia playbacks (the ability to play video and audio files, as well as support for 3GPP multimedia formats), connectivity for EV-DO and Bluetooth support, as well as screen savers, and other improvements. It also supports MIDP 2.0 on BREW 2.1 and it is backward compatible with BREW 1.x applications.

It was installed on most feature phones in Indonesia, China, and other countries since 2004 and was supported by a few carriers until 2017.

=== BREW 3.0 / 3.1 (2004–2012) ===

Released in mid-2002, it was installed for most of the BREW-enabled phones in late 2004 until early 2012. It was the first version of BREW to have major changes and it has a vast majority of features for mobile phones, such as WiFi connectivity, OpenGL ES 1.0, support for 3G, GPS, QWERTY-based keypads, and support for mobile screens that are higher than 176x220. It is backward compatible with BREW 2.x applications, but not with BREW 1.x applications.

It is also the first version of BREW to support 3D graphics rendering, although it only uses software rendering (which also supports JSR 184 for Java ME games). Hardware acceleration is also natively supported via OpenGL ES 1.0 (if a 3D acceleration chip is available).

It was installed on most feature phones in the United States and in other countries since 2005 and it is still supported by a few carriers.

=== BREW 4.0.1 - 4.0.2 (2007–2011) ===
Released in 2007 until 2011, it was only integrated on very few mobile phones (such as the LG enV Touch and the LG Versa). It has only a few improvements and it was later succeeded by Brew MP. It has additional features that are also available in Brew MP, such as accelerometer support and other changes.

It is also used for the Zeebo console in Mexico and Brazil.

=== Brew MP 5.0.1 - 5.0.4 (2009–2021) ===

Brew 5.0 was released in 2009 with several new features (including SVG images) and was backward compatible with BREW 3.x and 4.x. Some legacy APIs were deprecated in this version. This release also marked the move to BREW&#x27;s own real-time kernel, instead of utilizing Qualcomm&#x27;s REX OS. 

The Brew MP developer page was shut down on July 23, 2021, after eight years of inactivity.

==BREW application development==
For testing applications during the development process, the SDK includes a BREW emulator, or starting with BREW version 1.1 and above, the &quot;BREW Simulator&quot;. The BREW environment provides for multiple levels of application signatures. One signature authenticates the developer. Another signature verifies that an application has passed True BREW testing and is bestowed through Intertek. The individual telecommunications operators configure the handsets to either enforce or ignore the presence and verification of this second signature. BREW-enabled handsets have a test mode that allows applications to bypass verification of the signature. Qualcomm makes applications that have passed testing available to BREW-enabled wireless network operators. The operators are then able to choose which of these applications to make available to end-users on their catalog.

BREW&#x27;s own signatures are protected by an Electronic Serial Number (ESN) and a Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID), this means it prevents the unauthorized distribution/sideloading of BREW applications to 3rd-parties rather than carriers. Once the application is downloaded OTA via a BREW-based carrier, the .sig file will automatically generate an electronic serial number to its installed handset.

The BREW emulator, named &quot;BREW Simulator&quot;, does not emulate handset hardware. Instead, the BREW application is compiled to native code and linked with a compatible BREW runtime library. Because of this, applications cannot be tested for platform bugs related to memory alignment and various firmware-related glitches without a BREW handset operating in test mode.

For testing purposes, BREW applications can be transferred using a Universal Serial Bus (USB) or serial cable to any BREW-compatible handset using &quot;BREW App Loader&quot; from Qualcomm. A BREW application contains several components which, if not present and valid, cause the application to be automatically deleted on reboot. This includes the compiled binary file, a file that describes the application, the features it uses, and permissions requested, a file that contains string and image resources if required, and a file containing the application&#x27;s digital signature.

BREW applications may be unloaded from a consumer handset to save handset memory space. This is referred to as &quot;Disable/Restore&quot;, and is a requirement of the True BREW Test Process. Saved files are kept intact using Disable/Restore, and it is possible to reload the application without paying for it again. In a &quot;Disable&quot; situation, all .bar, .mod, and .sig files are deleted from the handset, while any other files remain in their original place. During the &quot;Restore&quot; operation, the .bar, .mod, and .sig files are downloaded from the carrier&#x27;s mobile store, and the previously disabled application will have full functionality remaining. The Disable/Restore process is only available to consumer users once the handset&#x27;s memory is full.

On May 28, 2008, Qualcomm and Adobe announced a partnership to integrate Adobe Flash Lite as a supported user interface on BREW.

Since March 2006, the least expensive digital signature package for developers costs US$400 for 100 application submissions.

==Business model implications/availability==
Strictly speaking, time to market can take longer with BREW than with Java ME because of Qualcomm BREW&#x27;s rigorous certification requirements. This certification process may be perceived as an advantage by established software developers because the difficulties associated with testing and development costs create a high cost of entry to developers with low budgets and little time, resulting in less market dilution. Specifically, developers of casual games run less risk of having to compete with freeware workalikes developed and self-published by hobbyists. However, this comes at a cost to the end-user as there is less competition to develop the best solution at the lowest price to the end user.

* After an application is written, it takes two weeks per iteration of True BREW testing (each time the application fails the test).
* Next, negotiations with carrier(s) commence.
* Then, (if successful) the carrier will spend time retesting the application with their own tests on their network.
* Finally, rolling out a new version means starting the process over again.

=== Differences between Java ME and BREW ===

Currently, most developers choose to support both Java ME and BREW, or only Java ME. Java ME may offer a lower cost to the market because most carriers allow non-certified Java ME applications to run on their phones. Java ME phones have a larger market share than BREW-enabled handsets. Java ME is widely used in Europe, while BREW is primarily used in the U.S. and Japan. One of the initial advantages of BREW was that Verizon made it easy to purchase applications from the phone, while most Java ME carriers did not. However, most carriers of Java ME phones now offer easy-to-access purchasing portals.

Owing to its different APIs, Java ME relies on Java&#x27;s virtual machine (interpreter-based code), which is technically slower than BREW, which uses native C/C++ plus and direct hardware access (especially for games). Java ME has limited subset of APIs (both for applications and games). However, 3rd-party APIs and implementations (such as &quot;MascotCapsule&quot; by HI CORPORATION. (3D rendering API) and &quot;DoJa&quot;/&quot;Star&quot; by NTT Docomo) are available, but not popular and successful outside Japan (particularly device adoption). BREW (on the other hand), relies on its own APIs and direct hardware access.

Performance for Java ME applications and games are slower than BREW. For 3D games, Java ME uses JSR 184 (M3G), which 3D games that are developed on Java ME are slower (which results in 10 frames per second on some/most handsets) and have limited graphics, while BREW uses either software rendering (if the BREW handset does not have a 3D acceleration chip) or OpenGL ES (which it can take advantage of its performance).

Unlike the Java ME, when the BREW application crashes, the phone will cause a reboot due to BREW can&#x27;t handle and recover while the application crashes, it creates &quot;$SYS.EXCEPT_(4-Digit Number)&quot; into the &quot;except&quot; folder on the root of directory, then the phone will automatically reboot by itself, when the Java ME application crashes under BREW, Java ME will handle correctly and recover them from phone rebooting by itself.

Some/few handset manufacturers do not allow to integrate Java ME&#x27;s virtual machine on a few of their phones.

There are now commercial technologies to fully automate porting from Java ME to BREW. This reduces the entry barrier to produce BREW applications by eliminating the need to develop two versions of the same application in both Java and C/C++.

== System failure ==
System failure in BREW is caused by the components are stopped working properly, a file required for a BREW application is missing, application crash, or some other errors. It creates the &quot;$SYS.EXCEPT_XXXX&quot; file inside the &quot;except&quot; folder on the root of directory. BREW&#x27;s system failure has 2 variants, the component error and the reboot of death.

=== Component error (example.c XXXXX) ===
Component error is an error that will display a black, white, or blue screen with an error text for about 5 seconds if a component stopped working properly, then the phone will reboot by itself. This error may vary depending on your activity, for example:

* fs_dir.c (file system error)
* mdsptask.c (task error)
* oemheap3x.c (heap violation)
* memory.c (memory corruption)
* nvm.c (NVM check violation)
* srch_mdsp.c (index error)
* callheap.c (call error)

The probability of this variant to occur is very rare, as a reboot of death is more common. Here&#x27;s an example of these activities to trigger this variant:

* Undervolting the phone while it&#x27;s running, it will cause memory corruption (usually if the battery is near flat, on modern devices, undervoltage protection was added) (e.g. LG VX10, LG VX4400, and LG PM225)
* The phone is at a defective condition. Usually, if this happened, the phone will trigger the reboot of death instead of displaying a component error.
* &quot;brew&quot;, &quot;nvm&quot;, or &quot;.efs_private&quot; folder is removed. (fs_dir.c or nvm.c)

=== Reboot of death ===

A reboot of death is an error that will reboot the phone by itself instead of displaying a black, white, or blue screen with text. The rarity of this variant to occur is much more common. Here&#x27;s an example of these activities to trigger this variant:

* Crashing an application.
* Removing the R-UIM card.
* The phone is at defective condition.
* Incorrectly entering an SP code.
* Application that requires files are missing.
* Running the exception test on engineering mode.

==Device usage and carrier availability==
Qualcomm BREW is used by some mobile phone manufacturers and mobile networks, however, most often the end-user does not know this since mobile phones running BREW most often lack any Qualcomm BREW branding and BREW runs in the background with the custom &quot;skins&quot; of the mobile phone manufacturer or operator on-top. Qualcomm BREW is used by Sprint Nextel, metroPCS, U.S. Cellular, Verizon, Syringa Wireless, Cricket Wireless, and AT&amp;T (in the HTC Freestyle) in the US, KDDI in Japan, KT and SK Telecom in South Korea, China Telecom in China, MOVILNET and BellSouth Chile in Latin America, Sistema Shyam (now MTS) in India, and by the 3 network in much of Europe, the UK and Australia on many mobile phones produced especially for their network.

Because BREW is only offered to mobile networks that operates in CDMA, other countries (with the exception of parts of Europe, the UK, and Australia via the 3 network, India, Japan and China) do not have BREW, because they do not have CDMA networks.

Manufacturers such as Huawei, INQ Mobile, Amoi, LG, Samsung Mobile, ZTE, and HTC amongst others use Qualcomm BREW in some of their mobile phones and it is featured in 3 UK phones such as the 3 Skypephone, INQ1, ZTE Z431 and Huawei u7510 (3 Touch). Tectoy&#x27;s Zeebo is the only game console to use BREW. Motorola&#x27;s own T720 as well as the RAZR V3m also use Qualcomm BREW.

<doc id="639657" wikidata="Q48788" url="?curid=639657" title="Riga State Gymnasium No.1">
<text>Riga State Gymnasium No.1 (), the oldest school in the Baltic states, offers secondary education (grades 7 to 12) in Riga, the capital of Latvia.

The school traces its origins to school of Riga Cathedral, which was founded in 1211, a decade after the foundation of Riga itself. Its name and language of instruction have changed several times during its history. The school language was German from the school&#x27;s foundation until 1892, when it became Russian. Latvian became the main language of instruction in 1919.

Today, the gymnasium is known for its strong programs in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science. Students wishing to enroll at the school take an admissions test in mathematics. Its admissions rate, with as many as nine candidates competing for each position, is one of the lowest in the country. Since 1997 the school enrolls 30 to 40 people in its International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme each year, where instruction is offered in English. It was the first school in the Baltic states to offer the IBO Diploma Programme. Each year a number of 12th grade students finish the DSD (Das Deutsches Sprachdiplom) programme by taking an exam along with the regular school leaving exams. Passing the exam enables them to pursue their higher education in German speaking countries.

Riga State Gymnasium No.1 is consistently ranked first among the schools in Latvia. Its students&#x27; average results on school leaving (state) exams are the highest in the country. Riga State Gymnasium No.1 is also the best school in Latvia based on its students&#x27; achievements at various domestic and international academic competitions.

Many of the graduates continue their education at highly ranked universities abroad, particularly in the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the USA. The percentage of these students is very high among the ones who graduate from the IBO Diploma Programme.

<text>An olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), also called an olfactory sensory neuron (OSN), is a sensory neuron within the olfactory system.

==Structure==
Humans have between 10 and 20 million olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In vertebrates, ORNs are bipolar neurons with dendrites facing the external surface of the cribriform plate with axons that pass through the cribriform foramina with terminal end at olfactory bulbs. The ORNs are located in the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. The cell bodies of the ORNs are distributed among all three of the layers of the olfactory epithelium.

Many tiny hair-like non-motile cilia protrude from the olfactory receptor cell&#x27;s dendrites. The dendrites extend to the olfactory epithelial surface and each ends in a dendritic knob from which around 20 to 35 cilia protrude. The cilia have a length of up to 100 micrometres and with the cilia from other dendrites form a meshwork in the olfactory mucus. The surface of the cilia is covered with olfactory receptors, a type of G protein-coupled receptor. Each olfactory receptor cell expresses only one type of olfactory receptor (OR), but many separate olfactory receptor cells express ORs which bind the same set of odors. The axons of olfactory receptor cells which express the same OR converge to form glomeruli in the olfactory bulb.

==Function==
ORs, which are located on the membranes of the cilia have been classified as a complex type of ligand-gated metabotropic channels. There are approximately 1000 different genes that code for the ORs, making them the largest gene family. An odorant will dissolve into the mucus of the olfactory epithelium and then bind to an OR. ORs can bind to a variety of odor molecules, with varying affinities. The difference in affinities causes differences in activation patterns resulting in unique odorant profiles. The activated OR in turn activates the intracellular G-protein, GOLF (GNAL), adenylate cyclase and production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) opens ion channels in the cell membrane, resulting in an influx of sodium and calcium ions into the cell, and an efflux of chloride ions. This influx of positive ions and efflux of negative ions causes the neuron to depolarize, generating an action potential.

===Desensitization===
The olfactory receptor neuron has a fast working negative feedback response upon depolarization. When the neuron is depolarizing, the CNG ion channel is open allowing sodium and calcium to rush into the cell. The influx of calcium begins a cascade of events within the cell. Calcium first binds to calmodulin to form CaM. CaM will then bind to the CNG channel and close it, stopping the sodium and calcium influx. CaMKII will be activated by the presence of CaM, which will phosphorylate ACIII and reduce cAMP production. CaMKII will also activate phosphodiesterase, which will then hydrolyze cAMP. The effect of this negative feedback response inhibits the neuron from further activation when another odor molecule is introduced.

===Number of distinguishable odors===
A widely publicized study suggested that humans can detect more than one trillion different odors. This finding has been disputed. Critics argued that the methodology used for the estimation was fundamentally flawed, showing that applying the same argument for better-understood sensory modalities, such as vision or audition, leads to wrong conclusions. Other researchers have also showed that the result is extremely sensitive to the precise details of the calculation, with small variations changing the result over dozens of orders of magnitude, possibly going as low as a few thousand. The authors of the original study have argued that their estimate holds as long as it is assumed that odor space is sufficiently high-dimensional.

<doc id="639663" wikidata="Q4926105" url="?curid=639663" title="Blepharisma">
<text>Blepharisma is a genus of unicellular ciliate protists found in fresh and salt water. The group includes about 40 accepted species, and many sub-varieties and strains. While species vary considerably in size and shape, most are easily identified by their red or pinkish color, which is caused by granules of the pigment blepharismin.

All members of the genus possess a long series of membranelles on the left side of the oral groove, and an &quot;undulating membrane&quot; (a structure resembling a flap, scarf or small sail, composed of long cilia fused together as a single sheet) on the right side of the peristome, toward the posterior.

Certain species of &quot;Blepharisma&quot; have served as model organisms for scientific research. Since some varieties are easily cultured and readily available from scientific supply houses, they are a common object of study in school science classes.

==Appearance==
&quot;Blepharisma&quot; may be as small as 50 micrometres in length, or as large as 1 mm (though normal size range is between 75 and 300 micrometres). Body shape varies within the genus. The type species of the genus, &quot;B. persicinum,&quot; is ellipsoidal. &quot;Blepharisma lateritium&quot; is teardrop-shaped, with a rounded posterior; while &quot;Blepharisma elongatum&quot; and &quot;Blepharisma sphagni&quot; are long and thin, tapering at the posterior into a tail-like point.

All species are uniformly ciliated, with the cilia arranged in longitudinal rows, and stripes of pigment alternating between rows of cilia. Cilia, short hairlike organelles, sweep food into its mouth and are used for movement. The pink or red pigmentation may be quite pale, and in certain cases it is absent altogether. A contractile vacuole, often quite large, is located in the posterior. The Macronuclei can take a variety of forms. Depending on species and phase of life, they may be rod-shaped, ovoid, spherical, or moniliform (like a rosary, or string of beads).

==Reproduction and sexual phenomena==
Like all ciliates, &quot;Blepharisma&quot; reproduce asexually, by binary fission, dividing transversally. Fission may occur spontaneously, as part of the vegetative cell cycle, or it may follow a sexual phenomenon called conjugation, a process through which genetic material is exchanged between cells. In conjugation, two organisms come into close contact, and a temporary cytoplasmic bridge forms between them. The micronuclei of each cell then undergo meiosis, and haploid micronuclei pass from one individual to the other. This permits the reshuffling of hereditary characteristics, as in other types of sexual reproduction. Conjugation is immediately followed by binary fission of the two conjugants.

In &quot;Blepharisma&quot;, as in some other ciliates, chemical substances called gamones are used to induce conjugation by stimulating interaction between compatible mating partners.

Although clonal cells of &quot;Blepharisma&quot; are sometimes able to conjugate with one another (a phenomenon known as selfing), conjugation ordinarily involves the interaction of cells of different mating types. In the species &quot;Blepharisma japonicum&quot;, there are two mating types (I and II), each type excreting a specific pheromone (termed gamone 1 and gamone 2, respectively). When sexually mature mating-type I cells are moderately starved, they autonomously produce and secrete gamone I. Gamone 1 specifically acts on mating-type II cells, transforming them so that they can unite with type I cells, and inducing them to secrete gamone 2. Gamone 2 then transforms type I cells so that they can unite with type II cells. Cells that can unite may then undergo conjugation. Conjugation of opposite mating types promotes outcrossing and the masking of deleterious recessive mutations in the diploid phase of the sexual cycle.

==Feeding and behavior==
&quot;Blepharisma&quot; feed on a variety of smaller organisms, including bacteria, flagellate algae, rotifers, other ciliates and even smaller members of the same species. Experiments with &quot;Blepharisma undulans&quot; have shown that cannibalism causes gigantism. When individuals are given a diet of smaller &quot;Blepharisma&quot;, or certain ciliates (particularly &quot;Colpidium colpoda&quot; or &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;), they grow to a relatively enormous size. As long as their diet remains unchanged, cannibal giants will divide to produce more giants. When large prey become unavailable, the offspring will revert to normal size.

=== Photobiology ===

&quot;Blepharisma&quot; are markedly photophobic, and when light levels are increased will seek out darkened areas. The ability to detect light is accomplished with photosensitive pigment granules located just under the plasma membrane of the cell. The pigment in these granules is blepharismin, the same substance that gives &quot;Blepharisma&quot; their characteristic pinkish color. &quot;Blepharisma&quot; are usually pink when collected in nature, but when grown in darkness with abundant food they turn red. Exposure to light or starvation causes them to lose their color, but deeply-pigmented cells can even be killed by strong light.

<text>Tess Gallagher (born 1943) is an American poet, essayist, and short story writer. Among her many honors were a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts award, Maxine Cushing Gray Foundation Award.

== Biography ==
Gallagher was born in Port Angeles, Washington to logger and longshoreman Leslie Bond and gardener mother Georgia Bond. She studied with poet-intellectual Theodore Roethke in the University of Washington, earning both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in English. She also attended the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, where she made films.

In November 1977 Gallagher met Raymond Carver, a short story writer and poet, at a writers&#x27; conference in Dallas, Texas and their relationship very much influenced her literary work, which included helping to edit and publish his writing. Beginning in January 1979, Carver and Gallagher lived together in El Paso, Texas, in a borrowed cabin near Port Angeles, Washington, and in Tucson, Arizona. In 1980, the two moved to Syracuse, New York, where Gallagher had been appointed the coordinator of the creative writing program at Syracuse University; Carver taught as a professor in the English department. They jointly purchased a house in Syracuse, at 832 Maryland Avenue. In ensuing years, the house became so popular that the couple had to hang a sign outside that read &quot;Writers At Work&quot; in order to be left alone.

In 1988, six weeks prior to his death, Carver and Gallagher married in Reno, Nevada.

Tess Gallagher spends part of her time living in a cottage in County Sligo, Ireland, and has a long-time Irish partner.

=== Raymond Carver and poetry ===

Raymond Carver influenced her to write the short stories that were collected in &quot;The Lover of Horses&quot; (1986).

She wrote &quot;Moon Crossing Bridge&quot;, a collection of love poems dedicated to Raymond Carver, who died in 1988.

She published the essay &quot;Instead of Dying&quot; in &quot;The Sun Magazine&quot; about Raymond Carver&#x27;s life.

=== Distant Rain: A Conversation Between Jakucho Setouchi and Tess Gallagher ===

&quot;Distant Rain&quot;, published in 2006, is a conversation between Tess and Jakucho Setouchi, a Buddhist nun from Kyoto, that happened in Japan in 1990. They spoke about poetry, Tess Gallagher&#x27;s grief about Raymond Carver, and differences between cultures.

=== Boogie-Woogie Crisscross ===

Tess Gallagher wrote the book of poetry &quot;Boogie-Woogie Crisscross&quot; in collaboration with Lawrence Matsuda. They sent each other emails with new poetry and ideas, then from these correspondences was gathered the book. The collaboration started when Alfredo Arreguin, Tess Gallagher&#x27;s friend, gave her poetry by Lawrence Matsuda&#x27;s about World War II and Japanese who were imprisoned in camp Minidoka located in the western United States. Tess Gallagher helped Lawrence Matsuda to find a publisher for the poetry about Minidoka and this was how their literary friendship began.

===Teaching career===
Gallagher has taught at various institutions including St. Lawrence University, University of Montana, University of Arizona, Syracuse University, Bucknell University, and Whitman College.

<doc id="639695" wikidata="Q8055510" url="?curid=639695" title="York Peppermint Pattie">
<text>York Peppermint Pattie is an American dark chocolate enrobed peppermint confection introduced in 1940 and currently produced by the Hershey Company.

==History==
About 1920, Henry Kessler founded the York Cone Company Corporation on South Pine Street in York, Pennsylvania. The company originally sold ice cream cones and waffles before Kessler wanted to make a chocolate and mint themed candy. Although news articles commonly have it that the York Peppermint Pattie was first produced in York, Pennsylvania by Henry Kessler at his York Cone Company in 1940, a trademark application for “York Peppermint Pattie Mint (Candy)” filed by York Cone Company Corporation on February 10, 1949, shows a first use in commerce date of January 28, 1922, soon after the founding of the company. The trademark registration number 0564557 was awarded on September 30, 1952.

Although chocolate-covered peppermints already existed before the York Peppermint Pattie came on the market, the York differed in that it was firmer and crisp, while the competition was softer and gooier. A former employee and York resident, Phil Kollin, remembered the final test that sample patties went through before leaving the factory: &quot;It was a snap test. If the candy didn&#x27;t break clean in the middle, it was a second.&quot;

The business expanded sales beyond the local market and without consumer advertising the York Peppermint Pattie was being sold in the Northeast, parts of the Midwest and in Florida.

On August 22, 1966, Charles M. Schulz introduced a character named Peppermint Patty to the Peanuts comic strip.

In 1972, the York Cone Company was acquired by Peter Paul, who then launched the York Peppermint Patties nationally in 1975.

Peter Paul then merged with Cadbury for $27.50 per share, a total of $58 million in 1978.

In August 1988, Hershey acquired the US confectionery operations of Cadbury Schweppes which included the Almond Joy, Mounds and York Peppermint Pattie business. The purchase price was $284.5 million plus an assumption of $30 million in debt, and it included licensing arrangements for Almond Joy, Mounds, York Peppermint Pattie, and certain Cadbury brands in the US market.

In 2009, after 23 years in the Reading plant, the production of the York Peppermint Pattie moved from Reading, Pennsylvania, to Mexico.

==Promotion==
During the 1970s, Peter Paul launched a memorable advertising campaign for the candy with the tagline &quot;Get the Sensation&quot; which continues to be used in the present day. A TV commercial in 1979 included the “Get The Sensation” theme.

In the fall of 1982, Peter Paul launched an advertising campaign using an “I Love New York” theme to promote adding 10% more chocolate to the candy.

National Peppermint Patty Day is celebrated each year on February 11.

==Product and variations==
In the confectionery industry, enrobing is a process that involves covering a confection or snack with chocolate or chocolate coatings. The York Peppermint Pattie confection features strongly contrasting flavors, with a bittersweet dark chocolate surrounding a sugary center with a strong peppermint flavor.

Over time there have been a number of product variations such as the following:

* &quot;Sugar Free Peppermint Patties&quot; – a sugar-free version of the traditional Peppermint Pattie.
* &quot;Chocolate Truffle Mint&quot; – introduced in 2004, which had a brown filling.
* &quot;Limited Edition Pink Pattie&quot; – introduced in October 2005. Peppermint Pattie with pink filling. Sale proceeds are donated to breast cancer research through the Young Survival Coalition.
* &quot;York Mints&quot; – introduced in 2007, a tin filled with bite-sized mints that have a mint shell, chocolate on the inside, and more mint on the inside.
* &quot;York Peppermint Bites&quot; – Introduced in 2003. Bite sized, round shaped candy. Introduced with other Hershey flavors.
* &quot;Peppermint Batties&quot; – Bat-shaped Peppermint Patties made each year around Halloween. Replaced with Peppermint Patties Pumpkins in 2007.
* &quot;Peppermint Patties Pumpkins&quot; – introduced in October 2007 for Halloween. Pumpkin-shaped Peppermint Patties with orange filling.
* &quot;Peppermint Patties Miniature Hearts Heart Box&quot; – introduced for Valentine&#x27;s Day. Heart-shaped patties in a heart-shaped box.
* &quot;Peppermint Pattie Snowflakes&quot; – for Christmas, snowflake-shaped Peppermint Patties.
* &quot;Egg-Shaped Patties&quot; – for Easter.

<doc id="639698" wikidata="Q6508968" url="?curid=639698" title="League for Socialist Action (Canada)">
<text>The League for Socialist Action (LSA) was the premier Trotskyist organization in Canada for much of the 20th century. Throughout its history the LSA went through many different names and iterations. In chronological order it was known as: the International Left Opposition (Trotskyist) of Canada, the Workers Party of Canada, the Socialist Policy Group, the Socialist Workers League, the Revolutionary Workers Party, The Club, the Socialist Education League, and the League for Socialist Action. 

==Origins==
The Canadian Trotskyist movement originated in the late 1920s as the left faction within the Communist Party of Canada. Maurice Spector, editor of the Communist Party newspaper &quot;The Worker&quot;, had been a Canadian delegate to the 1928 Comintern Congress in Moscow when he and American James Cannon inadvertently came across the suppressed platform of Trotsky&#x27;s Left Opposition. Spector was won over to Trotsky&#x27;s position and returned to Canada determined to build support for Trotsky in the party. He and his supporters were expelled 1928 and, with American Trotskyists, formed the Communist League of America and then a Canadian section called the International Left Opposition (Trotskyist) of Canada in 1932. Jack MacDonald, the expelled National Secretary of the Communist Party, joined. The Canadian Trotskyist movement went through a number of splits and reincarnations through the 1930s.

In 1934, most of the Montreal branch and about half a dozen members of the Toronto branch, led by William Krehm, left to form the Canadian section of the Organizing Committee for a Revolutionary Workers Party led by B. J. Field who had led a split from the Communist League of America. The Fieldite group, under Krehm&#x27;s leadership in Canada, published &quot;Workers Voice&quot; and was, for a time, more active than the Trotskyists but faded away by the outbreak of World War II.

In 1934, the ILO, led by MacDonald and Spector, abandoned its attempts to reform the Communist Party of Canada and became the Workers Party of Canada, which published a monthly newspaper, &quot;The Vanguard&quot;. It became a fortnightly paper in 1935. The Workers Party also published a twice-monthly Ukrainian newspaper, &quot;Labor News&quot;, and a youth magazine called first &quot;October Youth&quot; and then &quot;Young Militant&quot;.

The party had serious disputes over the Trotskyist movement&#x27;s orientation to the new social democratic party in Canada, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). In 1937, a majority of the Workers Party voted to join the CCF. They did so as the Socialist Policy Group, and published the newspaper &quot;Socialist Action&quot;. They were soon expelled from the CCF. They reunited with the faction that had opposed CCF work, and formed the Socialist Workers League in 1939 with Earle Birney as the principal leader as Macdonald and Spector had both dropped out of the movement.

==World War II==
The SWL was forced underground due to the implementation of the War Measures Act during World War II and their anti-war polemics which resulted in the group&#x27;s publication being banned. The day after war was declared in 1939, SWL member Frank Watson became the first person arrested under the Defence of Canada Regulations when he denounced the war at a street corner meeting at Bloor and Brunswick in Toronto. Birney dropped out by 1942, according to Dowson because of his support for the war, and the group became inactive.

==Revolutionary Workers Party==
The group was relaunched in 1946 as the Revolutionary Workers Party (RWP), Canadian Section of the Fourth International, under the leadership of Ross Dowson. The foundations of the party had been laid two years earlier, in 1944, when Canadian supporters of the Fourth International met in Montreal for their first national convention. Dowson ran for mayor of Toronto as an open Trotskyist at the end of the war and won over 20% of the vote.

==Entrism==
In 1952, the RWP ceased its public activities, including the publication of &quot;Labour Challenge&quot;, and its members began to practice entrism in the CCF. During this period the group had no formal name but was known to members as The Club (Trotskyists in Britain practicing entrism during this period were also known as &quot;The Club&quot;). The next year, the section split reflecting the international split in the Fourth International between the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) and the International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI). The majority of the RWP, including Ross Dowson, backed James P. Cannon and the International Committee, while a minority, including Dowson&#x27;s brother Murray and his brother-in-law Joe Rosenthal led a split from the Canadian section to form the Committee for the Socialist Regroupment of Canada in sympathy with Bert Cochran&#x27;s Socialist Union of America which had split from the American SWP and sided with Pablo and the International Secretariat. They were informally known as the &quot;Rose Group&quot; (after Rosenthal&#x27;s pseudonym) or as &quot;Labour Forum&quot;, which was the name of the series of public meetings they held in Toronto for several years, often featuring writers associated with the US publication &quot;Monthly Review&quot;.

Members of the former RWP (whose National Committee did not dissolve and whose branches continued to hold meetings) had difficulty working within the CCF. Dowson&#x27;s application for CCF membership was rejected while other ex-RWP members and their sympathisers found themselves facing persecution within the CCF.

==Socialist Education League==
In 1955, following the expulsion of 15 supporters from the CCF, the Toronto group reconstituted itself as the Socialist Education League (SEL), pledging itself to support the election of the CCF and with the goal of supporting the growth of the CCF&#x27;s left wing. To this end, they resumed publication of a regular periodical, &quot;Workers Vanguard&quot;. Meanwhile, the Vancouver branch, which had developed some disagreements with its Toronto co-thinkers, became the Socialist Information Centre (SIC).

==League for Socialist Action==
In 1961, the SEL and SIC merged and became the League for Socialist Action (LSA), with branches in Toronto and Vancouver, with the intention of being the Marxist tendency within the newly formed New Democratic Party (itself a merger of the CCF and Canadian Labour Congress). The Young Socialists was set up as an &quot;autonomous&quot; youth wing at the same time and was active in the New Democratic Youth of Canada, though their members were expelled if discovered by the NDP which considered LSA or YS membership incompatible with membership in the NDP.
Outside Toronto near Orono, Ontario, the LSA had a camp property called Camp Poundmaker named after the famous Plains Cree leader. The camp song was a comic parody and it went like this: Camp Poundmaker&#x27;s the place for me/Far away from the bourgeoise/Steady and true/I&#x27;ll be to you/Loyal to the LSA-LSO/Raise on guard the red flag/Cheer it with all your might/Hurray for Camp Poundmaker/Hurray for Camp Poundmaker, maker, Camp Poundmaker!

The LSA marked the resumption of open Trotskyist activities in Canada after almost a decade of underground work. In 1964, a branch was established in Montreal under the name Ligue Socialiste Ouvrière with the YS setting up as well, using the name Ligue des Jeunes Socialistes.

Members of the LSA were involved in the Waffle movement of the NDP, from 1969 until the expulsion of the Waffle from the NDP in 1972. The LSA decided to remain in the NDP.

In 1972, Dowson stepped down as Executive Secretary of the LSA and was given the position of chairman while John Riddell became Executive Secretary.

In the early 1970s, the United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USFI, which was the result of a 1963 reconciliation between the ISFI and the ICFI) was riven by an international faction fight. The majority and leadership supported the USFI faction associated with the Socialist Workers Party (United States).

Supporters of Ernest Mandel, many of whom were active in the student movement, coalesced at the 1973 convention of the LSA as the Revolutionary Communist Tendency, a minority tendency that ultimately left the LSA to join the Revolutionary Marxist Group which supported Mandel internationally. Amongst its leadership, Alain Beiner, Ruth Bullock, Al Cappe, Joan Newbigging, John Riddell, Ernie Tate and Art Young were signatories of the 1973 Declaration of the Leninist Trotskyist Tendency, supporting the SWP position in the USFI. In 1976, Bullock, Riddell, Tate and Young, as well as Dowson (no longer a member of the LSA at this point) were among the signatories of a document, &quot;The Verdict&quot;, supporting the SWP leadership against allegations made by Gerry Healey.

Dowson and his supporters, meanwhile, found themselves reduced to a minority within the LSA due to criticism of Dowson&#x27;s sympathy with Canadian economic nationalism. They left the LSA in 1974 to form the &quot;Socialist League&quot; which became known as the &quot;Forward Group&quot; after the name of its publication.

In 1977, supporters of the Revolutionary Marxist Group and a separate Quebec organization, the &quot;Groupe Marxiste Revolutionnaire&quot;, united with the League for Socialist Action and the &quot;Ligue Socialiste Ouvrière&quot; to form the Revolutionary Workers League/Ligue Ouvrière Révolutionnaire which became the new Canadian section of the USFI.

Also in 1977, the League for Socialist Action ran Therese Faubert, one of the first two known LGBT candidates in Canadian history to run in a provincial election, as its candidate in Brampton for the 1977 Ontario provincial election.

A feature length documentary film, &quot;Let&#x27;s Rent a Train!: Life in the Toronto Branch of the League for Socialist Action, 1961 - 1977&quot; recalls Canadian socialist activism of the 1960s and ‘70s and deals extensively with the antiwar and reproductive rights movements.

<text>Edward Carl Gaedel (June 8, 1925 – June 18, 1961) was the smallest player to appear in a Major League Baseball game.

Gaedel gained recognition in the second game of a St. Louis Browns doubleheader on August 19, 1951. Weighing and standing tall, he became the shortest player in the history of the Major Leagues. Gaedel made a single plate appearance and was walked with four consecutive balls before being replaced by a pinch-runner at first base. His jersey, bearing the uniform number &quot;&quot;, is displayed in the St. Louis Cardinals Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck, in his 1962 autobiography &quot;Veeck – As in Wreck&quot;, said of Gaedel, &quot;He was, by golly, the best darn midget who ever played big-league ball. He was also the only one.&quot;

== Early life ==
Edward Carl Gaedele (Gaedel) was born in Cook County, Illinois, on June 8, 1925. His father, Carl Gaedele (1886–1949), was a Lithuanian immigrant who managed a department store and worked as a parking lot checker. His mother, Helen (née Janicki), was a homemaker. In 1930, the Gaedele family lived in Chicago&#x27;s Garfield Ridge neighborhood, and by 1940, the family lived in Back of the Yards.

==Appearance==
Gaedel had worked as a riveter during World War II, as he was able to crawl inside the wings of airplanes. He was a professional performer, belonging to the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA). After the war, Gaedel was hired in 1946 by Mercury Records as a mascot to portray the &quot;Mercury Man&quot;. He sported a winged hat similar to the record label&#x27;s logo, to promote Mercury recordings. Some early Mercury recordings featured a caricature of him as its logo.

Browns&#x27; owner Bill Veeck, a showman who enjoyed staging publicity stunts, found Gaedel through a booking agency. Secretly signed by the Browns, he was added to the team roster and put in uniform (with the number &quot;&quot; on the back). The uniform was that of future St. Louis Cardinals managing partner and chairman William DeWitt, Jr. who was a 9-year-old batboy for the Browns at the time.

Gaedel came out of a papier-mache cake between games of a doubleheader at Sportsman&#x27;s Park in St. Louis to celebrate the American League&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The stunt was also billed as a Falstaff Brewery promotion. Falstaff, and the fans, had been promised a &quot;festival of surprises&quot; by Veeck. Before the second game got underway, the press agreed that the &quot;midget-in-a-cake&quot; appearance had not been up to Veeck&#x27;s usual promotional standard. Falstaff personnel, who had been promised national publicity for their participation, were particularly dissatisfied. Keeping the surprise he had in store for the second game to himself, Veeck just meekly apologized.

Although Veeck denied the stunt was directly inspired by it, the appearance of Gaedel was similar to the plot of &quot;You Could Look It Up&quot;, a 1941 short story by James Thurber. Veeck later said he got the idea from listening to the conversations of Giants manager John McGraw decades earlier when Veeck was a child.

===At the plate===
On August 19, 1951, Gaedel entered the second half of the doubleheader between the Browns and Detroit Tigers in the bottom of the first inning as a pinch-hitter for leadoff batter Frank Saucier. Immediately, umpire Ed Hurley called for Browns manager Zack Taylor. Veeck and Taylor had the foresight to have a copy of Gaedel&#x27;s contract on hand, as well as a copy of the Browns&#x27; active roster, which had room for Gaedel&#x27;s addition.

The contract had been filed late in the day on Friday, August 17. Veeck knew the league office would summarily approve the contract upon receipt, and that it would not be scrutinized until Monday, August 20. Upon reading the contract, Hurley motioned for Gaedel to take his place in the batter&#x27;s box (as a result of Gaedel&#x27;s appearance, all contracts must now be approved by the Commissioner of Baseball before a player can appear in a game). The change to that day&#x27;s St. Louis Browns scorecard, listing Gaedel and his uniform number, had gone unnoticed by everyone except Harry Mitauer, a writer for the &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot;. The Browns&#x27; publicity man shunted Mitauer&#x27;s inquiry aside. Until Gaedel stepped up to the plate, even his teammates had no idea he was actually going to play in the game.

Gaedel was under strict orders not to attempt to move the bat off his shoulder. When Veeck got the impression that Gaedel might be tempted to swing at a pitch, he warned Gaedel that he had taken out a $1 million insurance policy on his life, and that he would be standing on the roof of the stadium with a rifle prepared to kill Gaedel if he even looked like he was going to swing. Veeck had carefully trained Gaedel to assume a tight crouch at the plate; he had measured Gaedel&#x27;s strike zone in that stance and claimed it was just high. However, when Gaedel came to the plate, he abandoned the crouch he had been taught for a pose that Veeck described as &quot;a fair approximation of Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s classic style&quot;, leading Veeck to fear he was going to swing.

With Bob Cain on the mound—laughing at the absurdity that he actually had to pitch to Gaedel—and catcher Bob Swift catching on his knees, Gaedel took his stance. The Tigers catcher offered his pitcher a piece of strategy: &quot;Keep it low&quot;. Cain delivered four consecutive balls, all high (the first two pitches were legitimate attempts at strikes; the last two were half-speed tosses). Gaedel took his base (stopping twice during his trot to bow to the crowd) and was replaced by pinch-runner Jim Delsing. The 18,369 fans gave Gaedel a standing ovation.

===Baseball reaction===
Veeck had hoped that Delsing would go on to score in a one-run Browns victory, but he ended up stranded at third base and the Tigers won the game 6–2. American League president Will Harridge, saying Veeck was making a mockery of the game, voided Gaedel&#x27;s contract the next day. In response, Veeck threatened to request an official ruling on whether Yankees shortstop and reigning American League MVP Phil Rizzuto, who stood , was a short ballplayer or a tall dwarf.

Initially, Major League Baseball struck Gaedel from its record book, as if he had not been in the game. He was relisted a year later, as a right-handed batter and left-handed thrower (although he did not play the field). Eddie Gaedel finished his major league career with an on-base percentage of 1.000. His total earnings as a pro athlete were $100 (), the scale price for an American Guild of Variety Artists appearance.

==Later life==
Gaedel&#x27;s major league career lasted just the one plate appearance, but with Veeck&#x27;s 1959 acquisition of the White Sox he began working for Veeck in other capacities. On May 26, 1959, a helicopter carrying Gaedel and three other dwarfs dressed as spacemen &quot;invaded&quot; Comiskey Park, its apparent mission being the delivery of &quot;ray guns&quot; to two of the White Sox&#x27; smallest players, Nellie Fox and Luis Aparicio, to whom Gaedel reportedly confided, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be taken to your leader. I&#x27;ve already met him.&quot; On April 19, 1961, Veeck hired several dwarfs, including Gaedel, as vendors, allegedly due to &quot;some complaints&quot; from fans regarding hitherto blocked sight lines.

===Death===
On June 18, 1961, the unemployed Gaedel, who had just turned 36, was at a bowling alley in Chicago, his birthplace and hometown. Gaedel was followed home and beaten. His mother discovered him lying dead in his bed. He had bruises about his knees and on the left side of his face. A coroner&#x27;s inquest determined that he also had a heart attack. Bob Cain, who had pitched to Gaedel, was the only Major League Baseball figure to attend the funeral, despite the fact that the two never formally met. Gaedel was interred at Saint Mary Catholic Cemetery and Mausoleum in Cook County, Illinois. His tombstone indicates that his family name may actually have been &quot;Gaedele&quot;, not Gaedel.

==Legacy==
Gaedel is one of only five Major League players who drew a walk in their only plate appearance and never played the field. The first three all played in the 1910s: Dutch Schirick (September 17, 1914 with the Browns), Bill Batsch (September 9, 1916 with Pittsburgh) and Joe Cobb (April 25, 1918 with Detroit; although recent research shows that Cobb may have actually struck out in his only plate appearance). On June 24, 2007, Kevin Melillo of the Oakland Athletics did so against the New York Mets. Other than Gaedel, the other four players pinch-hit for pitchers; all five appeared in games their teams ultimately lost. For Gaedel, Schirick and Batsch, their one MLB appearance was their only professional appearance in organized baseball at any level.

Gaedel&#x27;s one-day career has been the subject of programs on ESPN and MLB Network. He was mentioned by name in the lyrics of Terry Cashman&#x27;s homage to 1950s baseball, &quot;Talkin&#x27; Baseball (Willie, Mickey, and the Duke).&quot; His at-bat was the No. 1 choice on a 1999 list of &quot;Unusual and Unforgettable Moments&quot; in baseball history published by the &quot;Sporting News&quot;.

In 1994, Veeck&#x27;s son Mike Veeck owned the minor league St. Paul Saints team. He brought the then 69-year-old Bob Cain to the park to &quot;reenact&quot; the at-bat, by pitching to the 10-year-old son of the Saints manager.

Because of its scarcity, Gaedel&#x27;s autograph now sells for more than Babe Ruth&#x27;s.

Gaedel&#x27;s grandnephew, Kyle Gaedele, was selected in the 2011 MLB draft by the San Diego Padres and played minor league baseball as high as the Double-A level.

<text>In physics, the term swampland refers to effective low-energy physical theories which are not compatible with quantum gravity. This is in contrast with the so-called &quot;string theory landscape&quot; that are known to be compatible with string theory, which is hypothesized to be a consistent quantum theory of gravity. In other words, the Swampland is the set of consistent-looking theories with no consistent ultraviolet completion with the addition of gravity.

Developments in string theory also suggest that the string theory landscape of false vacuum is vast, so it is natural to ask if the landscape is as vast as allowed by anomaly-free effective field theories. The Swampland program aims to delineate the theories of quantum gravity by identifying the universal principles shared among all theories compatible with gravitational UV completion. The program was initiated by Cumrun Vafa who argued that string theory suggests that the Swampland is in fact much larger than the string theory landscape.

Quantum gravity differs from quantum field theory in several key ways, including locality and UV/IR decoupling. In quantum gravity, a local structure of observables is emergent rather than fundamental. A concrete example of the emergence of locality is AdS/CFT, where the local quantum field theory description in bulk is only an approximation that emerges within certain limits of the theory. Moreover, in quantum gravity, it is believed that different spacetime topologies can contribute to the gravitational path integral, which suggests that spacetime emerges due to one saddle being more dominant. Moreover, in quantum gravity, UV and IR are closely related. This connection is manifested in black hole thermodynamics, where a semiclassical IR theory calculates the black hole entropy, which captures the density of gravitational UV states known as black holes. In addition to general arguments based on black hole physics, developments in string theory also suggests that there are universal principles shared among all the theories in the string landscape. 

The swampland conjectures are a set of conjectured criteria for theories in the quantum gravity landscape. The criteria are often motivated by black hole physics, universal patterns in string theory, and non-trivial self-consistencies among each other.

==No global symmetry conjecture==
The no global symmetry conjecture states that any symmetry in quantum gravity is either broken or gauged. In other words, there are no accidental symmetries in quantum gravity. The original motivation for the conjecture goes back to black holes. Hawking radiation of a generic black hole is only sensitive to charges that can be measured outside of the black hole, which are charges under gauge symmetries. Therefore, it is believed that the process of black hole formation and evaporation violates any conservation, which is not protected by gauge symmetry. The no global symmetry conjecture can also be derived from AdS/CFT correspondence in AdS.

===Generalization to higher-form symmetries===
The modern understanding of global and gauge symmetries allows for a natural generalization of the no-global symmetry conjectures to higher-form symmetries. A conventional symmetry (0-form symmetry) is a map that acts on point-like operators. For example, a free complex scalar field formula_1 has a formula_2 symmetry which acts on the operator formula_3 as formula_4, where formula_5 is a constant. One can use the symmetry to associate an operator formula_6 to any symmetry element formula_7 and codimension-1 hypersurface formula_8 such that formula_6 maps any charged local operator such as formula_3 to formula_11 if the point formula_12 is enclosed (or linked) by formula_8. By definition, the action of the operator formula_6 does not change by a continuous deformation of formula_8 as long as formula_8 does not hit a charged operator. Due to this feature, the operator formula_17 is called a topological operator. If the algebra governing the fusion of the symmetry operators has an element without an inverse, the corresponding symmetry is called a non-invertible symmetry. 

The above definitions can be generalized to higher dimensional charged operators. A collection of codimension-formula_18 topological operators which act non-trivially on dimension-formula_19 operators and are closed under fusion is called a formula_19-form symmetry. Compactification of a higher dimensional theory with a formula_19-form symmetry on a formula_19-dimensional torus can map the higher form symmetry to a formula_23-form symmetry in the lower dimensional theory. Therefore, it is believed that higher-form global symmetries are also excluded from quantum gravity.

Note that gauge symmetry does not satisfy this definition since, in the process of gauging, any local charged operator is excluded from the physical spectrum.

===Cobordism conjecture===
Global symmetries are closely connected to conservation laws. The no-global symmetry conjecture essentially states that any conservation law that is not protected by a gauge symmetry can be violated via a dynamical process. This intuition leads to the cobordism conjecture. 

Consider a gravitational theory that can be put on two backgrounds with formula_24 non-compact dimensions and internal geometries formula_25 and formula_26. Cobordism conjecture states that there must be a dynamical process which connects the two backgrounds to each other. In other words, there must exist a domain wall in the lower-dimensional theory which separates the two backgrounds. This resembles the idea of cobordism in mathematics, which interpolates between two manifolds by connecting them using a higher dimensional manifold. 

==Completeness of spectrum hypothesis==
The completeness of spectrum hypothesis conjectures that in quantum gravity, the spectrum of charges under any gauge symmetry is completely realized. This conjecture is universally satisfied in string theory, but is also motivated by black hole physics. The entropy of charged black holes is non-zero. Since the exponential of entropy counts the number of states, the non-zero entropy of black holes suggests that for sufficiently high charges, any charge is realized by at least one black hole state. 

===Relation to no-global symmetry conjecture===
The completeness of spectrum hypothesis is closely related to the no global symmetry conjecture. 

Example:

Consider a formula_2 gauge symmetry. In the absence of charged particles, the theory has a 1-form global symmetry formula_28. For any number formula_29 and any codimension 2 surface formula_8, the symmetry operator formula_31 multiplies a Wilson line that links with formula_8 by formula_33, where the charge associated with the Wilson line is formula_34 units of the fundamental charge. 

In the presence of charged particles, Wilson lines can break up. Suppose there is a charged particle with charge formula_35, the Wilson lines can change their charges for multiples of formula_35. Therefore, some of the symmetry operators formula_31 are no longer well-defined. However, if we take formula_35 to be the smallest charge, the values formula_39 give rise to well defined symmetry operators. Therefore, a formula_40 part of the global symmetry survives. To avoid any global symmetry, formula_35 must be 1 which means all charges appear in the spectrum. 

The above argument can be generalized to discrete and higher-dimensional symmetries. The completeness of spectrum follows from the absence of generalized global symmetry which also includes non-invertible symmetries.

==Weak gravity conjecture==
The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) is a conjecture regarding the strength gravity can have in a theory of quantum gravity relative to the gauge forces in that theory. It roughly states that gravity should be the weakest force in any consistent theory of quantum gravity.

===Original conjecture===
The weak gravity conjecture postulates that every black hole must decay unless it is protected by supersymmetry. Suppose there is a formula_2 gauge symmetry, there is an upper bound on the charge of the black holes with a given mass. The black holes that saturate that bound are extremal black holes. The extremal black holes have zero Hawking temperature. However, whether or not a black hole with a charge and a mass that exactly satisfies the extremality condition exists depends on the quantum theory. But given the high entropy of the large extremal black holes, there must exist many states with charges and masses that are arbitrarily close to the extremality condition. Suppose the black hole emits a particle with charge formula_43 and mass formula_44. For the remaining black hole to remain subextremal, we must have formula_45 in Planck units where the extremality condition takes the form formula_46.

===Mild version===
Given that black holes are the natural extension of particles beyond a certain mass, it is natural to assume that there must also be black holes with a charge-to-mass ratio that is greater than that of very large black holes. In other words, the correction to the extremality condition formula_47 must be such that formula_48.

===Higher dimensional generalization===
Weak gravity conjecture can be generalized to higher-form gauge symmetries. The generalization postulates that for any higher-form gauge symmetry, there exists a brane which has a charge-to-mass ratio that exceeds the charge-to-mass ratio of the extremal branes.

==Distance conjecture==
String dualities have played a crucial role in developing the modern understanding of string theory by providing a non-perturbative window into UV physics. In string theory, when one takes the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields of a theory to a certain limit, a dual description always emerges. An example of this is T-duality, where there are two dual descriptions to understand a string theory with an internal geometry of a circle. However, each perturbative description becomes valid in a different regime of the parameter space. The circle&#x27;s radius manifests itself as a scalar field in the lower dimensional theory. If one takes the value of this scalar field to infinity, the resulting theory can be described by the original higher dimensional theory. The new description includes a tower of light states corresponding to the Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles. On the other hand, if we take the size of the circle to zero, the strings that wind around the circle will become light. T-duality is the statement that there exists an alternative description which captures these light winding states as KK particles. Note that in the absence of a string, there is no reason to believe any states should become light in the limit where the size of the circle goes to zero. Distance conjecture quantifies the above observation and states that it must happen at any infinite distance limit of the parameter space. 

===Original conjecture===
If one takes the vacuum expectation value of the scalar fields to infinity, there exists a tower of light and weakly coupled states whose mass in Planck units goes to zero. Moreover, the mass of the particles depends on the canonical distance travelled in the moduli space formula_49 as formula_50, where formula_51 and formula_52 are constants. Moreover, there is a universal dimension-dependent lower bound on formula_52.

The canonical distance between two points in the target space for scalar expectations values (moduli space) is measured using the canonical metric formula_54, which is defined by the kinetic term in action. 

:formula_55

===Emergent string conjecture===
A stronger version of the original distance conjecture additionally postulates that the lightest tower of states at any infinite distance limit is either a KK tower or a string tower. In other words, the leading tower of states can either be understood via dimensional reduction of a higher dimensional theory (just like the example provided above) or as excitations of a weakly coupled string.

This conjecture is often further strengthened by imposing the string to be a fundamental string. 

===The sharpened distance conjecture===
The sharpened distance conjecture states that in formula_24 spacetime dimensions, formula_57.

<text>Robert Brown Thomson (October 25, 1923 – August 16, 2010) was an American professional baseball player, nicknamed &quot;the Staten Island Scot&quot;. He was an outfielder and right-handed batter for the New York Giants (1946–53, 1957), Milwaukee Braves (1954–57), Chicago Cubs (1958–59), Boston Red Sox (1960), and Baltimore Orioles (1960). His pennant-winning three-run home run for the Giants in 1951 is popularly known as the &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot;, and is one of the most famous moments in baseball history. It overshadowed his other accomplishments, including eight 20-home-run seasons and three All-Star selections. &quot;It was the best thing that ever happened to me&quot;, he said. &quot;It may have been the best thing that ever happened to anybody.&quot;

==Early life==
Thomson was born in the Townhead area of Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. He was the youngest of six children born to parents James and Elizabeth. He arrived in the United States two years later. James, a cabinet maker, had moved to New York City shortly before Bobby&#x27;s birth and sent for his family in 1925. 

Thomson grew up on Staten Island in New York City and signed with the New York Giants for a $100 bonus right out of Curtis High School in 1942. On December 5, 1942, he joined the United States Army Air Forces and trained as a bombardier. His entire service was within the continental United States. He played semiprofessional baseball in the summer of 1945 while awaiting his discharge.

==Early baseball career==
Thomson batted .283 with 29 home runs and 82 runs batted in (RBIs) in his rookie year, 1947. The following season, he batted .248 with 16 home runs. In 1949, Thomson had career bests in RBIs (109) and batting average (.309). His batting average dropped to .252 in 1950. He then hit a career-high 32 home runs in 1951, the fifth-best total in the major leagues; he also had the fourth-highest slugging average in baseball that year.

==The &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot;==
Thomson became a celebrity for his walk-off home run off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca to win the 1951 National League pennant. The home run, nicknamed the &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot;, was dramatic as, until 1969, league pennants were only decided by a playoff when the teams involved finished the regular season in a tie. Prior to 1951, playoffs had only been necessary in 1946 (NL) and 1948 (AL).

Although in mid-August, the Giants were games behind the league-leading Dodgers, they won 37 of their final 44 games to tie Brooklyn on the final day of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff. The Giants won the first game 3–1 as a result of a two-run home run by Thomson (off Branca). Brooklyn&#x27;s Clem Labine shut out the Giants in the second game, 10–0. The decisive contest, played on October 3 at the Polo Grounds, was the first major sporting event televised coast-to-coast in the United States. The Dodgers took a 4–1 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning, but Giants shortstop Alvin Dark singled, advanced to third on a single by Don Mueller, and scored on a double by Whitey Lockman. With Lockman on second and pinch runner Clint Hartung at third, Thomson&#x27;s walk-off home run turned looming defeat into a 5–4 victory. The moment was immortalized by Giants play-by-play announcer Russ Hodges&#x27;s excited multiple repetitions: &quot;The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!&quot;

Waiting in the on-deck circle to hit behind Thomson was rookie Willie Mays. The Giants&#x27; season ended, however, at the 1951 World Series; the Yankees swept the last three games to win the best-of-seven series, four games to two. Thomson batted .238 in the series with no home runs.

The bat from the &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot; is in the collection of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. The uniform worn by Thomson on that day is apparently a part of a large private collection owned by Dan Scheinman, a member of the San Francisco Giants ownership group.

===Sign stealing===

Longstanding rumors that the Giants engaged in systematic sign stealing during the second half of the 1951 season were confirmed in 2001. Several players told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that beginning on July 20, coach Herman Franks used a telescope positioned in the Giants clubhouse behind center field to steal the finger signals of opposing catchers. Stolen signs were relayed to the Giants dugout via a buzzer wire. Joshua Prager, the author of the &quot;Journal&quot; article, outlined the evidence in greater detail in a 2008 book.

Although Thomson always insisted that he had no foreknowledge of Branca&#x27;s pitch, Sal Yvars told Prager that he relayed Rube Walker&#x27;s fastball sign to Thomson. Branca was privately skeptical of Thomson&#x27;s denials, but made no public comment at the time. Later, he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to diminish a legendary moment in baseball. And even if Bobby knew what was coming, he had to hit it... Knowing the pitch doesn&#x27;t always help.&quot; Whether the telescope-and-buzzer system contributed significantly to the Giants&#x27; late-season 37–7 win streak remains a subject of debate. Prager notes in his book that sign stealing was not specifically forbidden by MLB rules at the time and, moral issues aside, &quot;...has been a part of baseball since its inception&quot;. Sign stealing using optical or other mechanical aids was outlawed by MLB in 1961.

==Later years==
In 1952, Thomson led the National League with 14 triples while batting .271 with 25 home runs and 109 RBIs for the Giants. In his final season with the Giants in 1953, Thomson hit 26 home runs and 106 RBIs, and a .288 average. That winter, he was sent to the Milwaukee Braves in a multiplayer deal. During his first spring training with the Braves in 1954, he suffered a broken ankle, which allowed rookie Hank Aaron to earn a place in the Milwaukee lineup. Thomson batted a career-low .232 in 1954.

The Braves traded Thomson back to the Giants during the 1957 season, and he was in the lineup for the club&#x27;s final game at the Polo Grounds. The Giants moved to San Francisco for the 1958 season, but Thomson was gone, traded to the Cubs. He spent two seasons in Chicago before closing out his major-league career in the American League with the Red Sox and Orioles. He played one final season in 1963 with the Yomiuri Giants in Japan.

Thomson was a career .270 hitter with 264 home runs and 1,026 RBIs in 1,779 games. He was selected an All-Star in 1948, 1949, and 1952.

In the 1990s, over 40 years after his famous home run, Thomson received a letter from a Marine who had been stationed in Korea in 1951:
:&quot;I was in a bunker in the front line with my buddy listening to the radio. It was contrary to orders, but he was a Giants fanatic. He never made it home, and I promised him if I ever got back, I&#x27;d write and tell you about the happiest moment of his life. It&#x27;s taken me this long to put my feelings into words. On behalf of my buddy, thanks, Bobby.&quot;

After baseball, Thomson became a sales executive at a New York City paper-products company. He lived in Watchung, New Jersey, until 2006, when he moved to Savannah, Georgia, to be near his daughter Nancy and his grandchildren. He died August 16, 2010, at his home in The Marshes of Skidaway Island, a continuing care facility in Savannah.

==Honors==
Scottish baseball team Edinburgh Diamond Devils named their home Bobby Thomson Field. It was opened by Thomson himself in 2003, while he was in Scotland to be inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.

The UK Chapter of The Society for American Baseball Research is named the Bobby Thomson Chapter.

The Curtis High School Field in Staten Island was renamed Bobby Thomson Field in 2007.

Thomson was inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame in the class of 1995.

<text>Björn Sighsten Herrgård was a Finnish-born Swedish fashion designer and major trendsetter in Stockholm. In 1987, Herrgård was the first Swedish celebrity with AIDS to disclose their status in public.

Sighsten Herrgård received his fashion education at Beckmans School of Design in Stockholm and at the pattern development academies in Stockholm and Copenhagen. His career took off in 1966 when he won the Courtauld International Design Competition with a collection of unisex clothing. In the 1970s Herrgård established internationally in Paris and North America; he also started a company in Stockholm and worked with television, magazines and shows.

On 29 July 1987, Herrgård held a press conference, stating that &quot;I&#x27;m going to die. I have AIDS. I may only have months left, but I want to die with dignity&quot;. His partner Roar Klingenberg (22 November 1941 – 21 September 1984), the first AIDS patient diagnosed in Sweden, had died 3 years earlier.

<doc id="639717" wikidata="Q287771" url="?curid=639717" title="Kichijōji">
<text>is a neighborhood in the city of Musashino in Western Tokyo, Japan. It is centered on a compact commercial area to the north and south of Kichijoji Station, with a full range of shops, restaurants, bars, and coffee houses. The area is a popular center for shopping and leisure in the Tokyo metropolitan area due in part to its close proximity to Inokashira Park and Inokashira Park Zoo. 

Kichijoji has been voted the number 1 place in Japan that Japanese would like to live every year since the 1990s according to polls by the magazine CNN GO. Kichijōji Station is served by the Chūō Line which runs to Tokyo Central Station in around 30 minutes, the Chūō–Sōbu Line, a Tozai Line through service and is also a terminus of the Keiō Inokashira Line, which takes passengers as far as Shibuya in around 20 minutes on the express service.

== History ==
This town was named after the Kichijō-ji Temple which was located in Bunkyō City, Tokyo, before being destroyed by fire in the year 1657. This temple, in turn, derived its name from the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, corresponding to Kisshōten in Japan.

During the Great fire of Meireki, the town in front of Suwazan Kichijō-ji Temple gate, Edo&#x27;s Hongo Motomachi (now: Hongō 1-chome, Bunkyō, near Suidōbashi Station) was destroyed by fire. Afterwards, based on town planning, the shogunate rebuilt the area for daimyō residences. Since the residents who used to live in front of Kichijo-ji gate had suffered great loss of residence and farm land, the shogunate&#x27;s official reed lands named &quot;Reno&quot; and &quot;Mureno&quot; were provided as substitute land for them. Those hoping to apply were given a rice stipend and house construction loans with a 5 year limit. Kichijo-ji samurai, Sato Sadaemon and Miyazaki Jinemon, in cooperation with local farmer Matsui Jurozaemon, opened up the eastern district of present day Musashino and relocated the residents there.

Soon after, with the opening of the Tamagawa Aqueduct, the previously poorly watered uninhabited Musashino Plateau was cultivated, turning it into a vast farmland. In the process, the neatly partitioned thin rectangular shaped plots of land along Itsukaichi Kaidō (ja) (currently Tokyo Metropolitan Route 7, Suginami Akiruno Line) were formed. Some migrants were granted lengths of land of more than 1000 meters long in the land area extending from Itsukaichi Kaidō to the Tamagawa Aqueduct, up to where the Senkawa Aqueduct (ja) divides. But the soil was not fertile, so all of the farmland became dry soil fields, with no wet rice fields. Because of the residents who still had attachment to the former Kichijo-ji, the new fields were named Kichijōji Village.

== Economy ==
The neighborhood is dominated by a shopping district centered on a covered street, Sun Road, which extends north from Kichijōji Station. This well organized and clean area includes amenities, shops, entertainment and restaurants.

Halfway up this shopping street is the Buddhist temple &quot;Gessō-ji&quot; (月窓寺), with graveyard, and at the northern end of it are Shinto shrines, the latter holding the occasional festival, with amusements such as fishing for gold fish, sweet food stalls, and typical dishes.

On the north, east, and south sides of the station is a large nightlife area with many restaurants, bars, izakaya, and &quot;live&quot; houses. On the north-east side of the station lies a red-light district on the Chūō Line between Tachikawa and Shinjuku, containing numerous cabarets, bars, and pink salons.

The anime and manga companies Coamix and Bee Train have their headquarters in Kichijōji. Studio Ghibli was previously located in Kichijōji.

== Inokashira Park ==

Inokashira Park, the source of the Kanda River (神田川 Kanda-gawa), is located south of Kichijōji Station, and is a favorite spot for springtime &quot;hanami&quot;, or cherry-blossom viewing. Public-opinion surveys consistently designate Kichijōji one of Tokyo&#x27;s most desirable residential neighborhoods. It features a large center lake, petting zoo, small cafes, food vendors, and street performers around the perimeter of the park. Nearby is the Ghibli Museum, which is part of the neighboring city Mitaka.

== Education ==
Seikei University (成蹊大学) is a private university in the northwestern area of the district. It is part of a wider educational institute—an escalator school—which teaches from elementary school right through to university level, and is situated amongst rows of large trees in that area of Kichijōji.

Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education operates area high public schools.

Musashino City operates public elementary and junior high schools.
Little Angels International School, a private international school, previously had a campus in Kichijōji.

Axis International School is a private school accepting children from the age of 1 to the second year of university.

<doc id="639718" wikidata="Q4935635" url="?curid=639718" title="Bobby Thompson (comedian)">
<text>Robert Michael Thompson (18 November 1911 – 16 April 1988) was an English stand-up comedian, actor and entertainer from Penshaw, Sunderland. Although he was raised in Penshaw, he also lived in Great Lumley and Barley Mow, near Chester-le-Street, later moving to Whitley Bay.

==Early years==
He was the seventh child of John and Mary Thompson, both of whom died by the time Bobby was eight years old. He was then raised by his elder sister in the village of Fatfield.

After leaving school at fifteen, he started work at North Biddick Colliery, earning seven shillings and sixpence a week. He would supplement his income by playing the harmonica around local public houses and competing in Domino tournaments. His first stand-up performance took place at the Gem Cinema in Penshaw as a young boy.

Thompson was married three times. His first wife was Anna Marjoram . His second wife, Phyllis, died on 25 April 1967. He announced his engagement to Mary Douglass, 62, of Annfield Plain a few years later, but the engagement was called off. In 1982, Thompson married his housekeeper, Eleanor Cicely Palmer, more commonly known as Cissy Ward (née Wake). Thompson was her third husband and she was famous for being taller than him.

==Career==
Famous for his broad Pitmatic accent, self-deprecating humour and mastery of the mother-in-law joke, Thompson was affectionately known as &quot;The Little Waster&quot; due to his short stature, which he often played on during his act. His most famous outfit was a worn-out striped jumper and a flat cap. An ever-present Woodbine cigarette stub hanging from the corner of his mouth was also an integral part of his on-stage persona.

His attempts to move beyond North East England were limited and hindered by the regional bias of his humour, although he did enjoy some success with the BBC radio variety show &quot;Wot Cheor Geordie&quot;, and appeared on the Wogan television talk show in 1985.

Bobby made recordings of three comedy songs written for him by local composer Eric Boswell: &quot;You Little Waster&quot;. The songs incorporated jokes from Bobby&#x27;s act.

Personal problems and his health affected his career in the 1970s, but he remained a North East favourite, particularly on the club scene, until his death.

== Death ==
Thompson died on 16 April 1988, after suffering from emphysema and cancer.
