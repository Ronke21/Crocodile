<text>Hermann von Salza (or Herman of Salza; – 20 March 1239) was the fourth Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, serving from 1210 to 1239. A skilled diplomat with ties to the Frederick II and the Pope, Hermann oversaw the expansion of the military order into Prussia.

==Biography==
Hermann von Salza was born to a dynasty of ministeriales of the Thuringian landgraves, probably at Dryburg Castle in Langensalza. With Landgrave Louis III of Thuringia he may have already taken part in the 1189/91 Siege of Acre, where the Teutonic Order was founded. He possibly also joined Landgrave Hermann I and the Henneberg count Otto von Botenlauben on the Crusade of 1197 and witnessed the coronation of King Amalric II of Jerusalem. The crusade was aborted upon the death of Emperor Henry VI, whereafter the Teutonic Knights were re-established as a military order under Grand Master Heinrich Walpot von Bassenheim to secure the conquered estates of the Holy Land. The precise time of Hermann&#x27;s entry into the Order is unknown, but he first appears as Grand Master at the coronation of Count John of Brienne as King of Jerusalem in 1210. As such he may have spent some time in the Mediterranean Sea region during the first year of his rule. During this period the activities of the Knights were extended from Spain to Livonia.

Hermann was a friend and councilor of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II, for whom he represented as a mediator in the Papal curia from 1222 onwards. Pope Honorius III also recognized Hermann&#x27;s capabilities, and granted the Teutonic Knights an equal status with the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar, after it had gone into decline under previous Grand Masters.

At the request of King Andrew II of Hungary in 1211, Hermann led the placing of Teutonic Knights in the Burzenland in Transylvania to defend against the Cumans. Hungarian nobles complained of the order&#x27;s presence, however, and they were forced to leave by 1225. Meanwhile, Hermann accompanied Frederick on the Fifth Crusade against Damietta in 1219, and he was decorated for bravery by John of Brienne. Hermann later convinced Frederick to undertake the Sixth Crusade, and was partially responsible for Frederick&#x27;s marriage to Isabella, John of Brienne&#x27;s daughter.

Upon his return to Europe, Hermann helped to end the War of the Keys and lift Frederick&#x27;s excommunication. He was then requested by Konrad I of Masovia to fight the pagan Old Prussians. After Hermann had gained approval from both the Pope and the Emperor the knights began their lengthy campaign to Christianize Prussia in 1230.

Hermann&#x27;s subsequent visits with the Pope or the Emperor brought new privileges and donations to the Order. He was also able to obtain the incorporation of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword into the Teutonic Order in 1237. The importance of Hermann&#x27;s role as mediator between Pope Gregory IX and the emperor can be seen by the fact that all communication between Frederick and the pope broke off with Hermann&#x27;s death.

Within the Teutonic Order, however, the knights began to grow dissatisfied at the absence of their Grand Master, so they recalled him and had him withdraw from his political life. However, he was less successful as a religious leader, and soon retired to Salerno in 1238. He died there in 1239.

== Legacy ==
A marble bust of Hermann stood as a secondary figure at the side of the Brandenburg margrave Albrecht II (Sculptor Johannes Boese) in the former Berlin Siegesallee. It has been in the Spandau Citadel since May 2009. Albrecht had participated in the founding meeting of the order in 1198 in Akkon and had already met the Grand Master on the Third Crusade (1189–1192).

A memorial plaque for Hermann von Salza was included in the Walhalla memorial near Regensburg.

During the Second World War, Panzer Division SS-Panzer-Abteilung 11 was named &quot;Hermann von Salza&quot;.

<text>Operation Sandstone was a series of nuclear weapon tests in 1948. It was the third series of American tests, following Trinity in 1945 and Crossroads in 1946, and preceding Ranger. Like the Crossroads tests, the Sandstone tests were carried out at the Pacific Proving Grounds, although at Enewetak Atoll rather than Bikini Atoll. They differed from Crossroads in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons. Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military.

The successful testing of the new cores in the Operation Sandstone tests rendered every component of the old weapons obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, production of the old cores was halted, and all effort concentrated on the new Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. More efficient use of fissionable material as a result of Operation Sandstone would increase the U.S. nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949.

==Origins==
Nuclear weapons were developed during World War II by the Manhattan Project, which created a network of production facilities, and the weapons research and design laboratory at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Two types of bombs were developed: the Mark 1 Little Boy, a gun-type fission weapon using uranium-235, and the Mark 3 Fat Man, an implosion-type nuclear weapon using plutonium.

These weapons were not far removed from their laboratory origins. A great deal of work remained to improve ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended during the war that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development. Norris Bradbury, who replaced Robert Oppenheimer as director at Los Alamos, felt that &quot;we had, to put it bluntly, lousy bombs.&quot;

Plutonium was produced by irradiating uranium-238 in three 250 MW nuclear reactors at the Hanford site. In theory they could produce of plutonium per megawatt-day, or about per month. In practice, production never approached such a level in 1945, when only between was produced per month. A Fat Man core required about of plutonium, of which 21% fissioned. Plutonium production fell off during 1946 due to swelling of the reactors&#x27; graphite neutron moderators. This is known as the Wigner effect, after its discoverer, the Manhattan Project scientist Eugene Wigner.

These reactors were also required for the production (by irradiation of bismuth-209) of polonium-210, which was used in the initiators, a critical component of the nuclear weapons. Some of bismuth-209 had to be irradiated for 100 days to produce 600 curies of polonium-210, a little over . Because polonium-210 has a half-life of only 138 days, at least one reactor had to be kept running. The oldest unit, B pile, was therefore closed down so that it would be available in the future. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.

Uranium-235 was derived from enrichment of natural uranium at the Y-12 plant and K-25 site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Improvements in the processes and procedures of the electromagnetic and gaseous isotope separation between October 1945 and June 1946 led to an increase in production to around of uranium-235 per month, which was only enough for one of the very wasteful Little Boys. A Fat Man was 17.5 times as efficient as a Little Boy, but a ton of uranium ore could yield eight times as much uranium-235 as plutonium, and on a per-gram basis, plutonium cost somewhere between four and eight times as much to produce as uranium-235, which at this time cost around $26 per gram.

==Weapon development 1945–1948==
The objectives of the Sandstone series of tests were to:
# test nuclear cores and initiators;
# improve the theory and knowledge of implosion type weapons;
# test levitated cores;
# test composite cores; and
# determine the most economic designs in terms of efficient use of fissionable material.

Levitation meant that instead of being immediately inside the tamper, there would be an air gap between the tamper and the core, which would be suspended inside on wires. This would allow the tamper to gain more momentum before striking the core. The principle was similar to swinging a hammer at a nail versus putting the hammerhead directly on the nail and pushing as hard as possible. In order for this to work outside the laboratory, the wires had to be strong enough to withstand being dropped from an aircraft, but thin enough to not disturb the spherical symmetry of the implosion. The Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, known as T Division, had run computer calculations on the levitated core as early as March 1945. The use of the levitated core had been proposed during the planning for Operation Crossroads, but it had been decided instead to use the existing solid core &quot;Christy&quot; design. This was named after its designer, Robert Christy. For Sandstone, however, it was decided that at least two of the three tests would use levitated cores.

The motivation behind the composite core was to make better use of the available fissionable material. The use of uranium-235 in an implosion weapon instead of the inefficient gun type Little Boy was an obvious development. However, while plutonium was more expensive and harder to produce than uranium-235, it fissions faster, because it makes better use of the neutrons its fission produces. On the other hand, the slower reaction of uranium-235 permits the assembly of super-critical masses, making it theoretically possible to produce weapons with high yields. By July 1945, Oppenheimer and Groves were considering using both materials in a composite core containing of plutonium and of uranium-235. The composite cores became available in 1946. Los Alamos&#x27; priority then became the development of an all-uranium-235 core. By January 1948 the national stockpile contained 50 cores, of which 36 were composite Christy cores, nine were plutonium Christy cores, and five were composite levitated cores. Testing the new levitated, composite and uranium-235 cores would require at least three test firings.

More efficient weapons would require less efficient initiators. This meant that less polonium would be required. At the time of Sandstone, the national stockpile of polonium-beryllium initiators consisted of 50 A-Class initiators, with more than 25 curies of polonium, and 13 B-Class initiators with 12 to 25 curies. During Sandstone, at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.

==Preparations==

===Organization===

The tests were authorized by President Harry S. Truman on June 27, 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s Director of Military Applications, Brigadier General James McCormack and his deputy, Captain James S. Russell, met with Bradbury and John Henry Manley at Los Alamos on July 9 to make arrangements for the tests. They readily agreed that they would be scientific in nature, with Los Alamos supplying the technical direction and the armed forces providing supplies and logistical support. The cost of the tests, around $20 million, was divided between the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission. Lieutenant General John E. Hull was designated as test commander. Rear Admiral William S. Parsons and Major General William E. Kepner reprised their Operation Crossroads roles as deputy commanders. Joint Task Force 7 was formally activated on October 18, 1947. As its commander, Hull was answerable to both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Atomic Energy Commission.

Joint Task Force 7 consisted of 10,366 personnel, 9,890 of them military. Its headquarters consisted of about 175 men, of whom 96 were on board the . The rest were accommodated on the , and . A special division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, known as J Division, was created specifically to manage nuclear testing. An Atomic Energy Commission group (Task Group 7.1) was responsible for preparing and detonating the nuclear weapons, and conducting the experiments. It consisted of some 283 scientists and technicians responsible for nuclear tests from J Division, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, the Naval Research Laboratory, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, the Aberdeen Proving Ground, the Atomic Energy Commission, Edgerton, Germeshausen &amp; Grier, and other agencies. 

Each dealt with a different aspect of the tests. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did gamma ray measurements. Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship , in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in the tests.

===Civil affairs===

In September 1947, Hull, Russell, who was designated test director on October 14, and Joint Task Force 7&#x27;s scientific director, Darol K. Froman from the Los Alamos Laboratories, set out with a group of scientists and military officers to examine various proposed test sites in the Pacific. Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on October 11. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.

As the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands was a United Nations trust territory administered by the United States, the United Nations Security Council was notified of the upcoming tests on December 2. The atoll was inhabited by the dri-Enewetak, who lived on Aomon, and the dri-Enjebi, who lived on Bijire. Their original homes had been on Enewetak and Enjebi, but they had been moved during the war to make way for military bases. The population, about 140 in number, had been temporarily relocated to Meck Island during Operation Crossroads. This time, Ujelang Atoll, an uninhabited atoll southwest of Enewetak, was selected as a relocation site. A Naval Construction Battalion group arrived there on November 22 to build accommodation and amenities. The military authorities met with the local chiefs on December 3, and they agreed to the relocation, which was carried out by by December 20. An LST and four Douglas C-54 Skymaster aircraft were placed on standby to evacuate Ujelan in case it was affected by fallout, but were not required.

In January 1948, General William E. Kepner and the Joint Chiefs officially authorized the incorporation of a Long-Range Detection (LRD) element into the Sandstone tests, designating it as Operation Fitzwilliam. This top-secret initiative aimed to establish techniques for identifying nuclear explosions worldwide. The operation remained classified for decades and was not declassified until 2014.

Unlike the Crossroads tests, which were conducted in the media spotlight, the Sandstone tests were carried out with minimal publicity. On April 15, there was still discussion in Washington about whether or not there should be any public announcement of the tests at all. Hull opposed making any announcement until after the series was completed, but the AEC commissioners felt that the news would leak out, and the United States would look secretive. It was therefore decided to make a last minute announcement. There was no announcement of the purpose of the tests, and only cursory press releases. On 18 May, after the series was over, Hull held a press conference in Hawaii, but only permitted the media to quote from written statements.

===Construction===

Enjebi, Aomon, and Runit Islands were cleared of vegetation and graded level to make it easier to install the required instrumentation, and a causeway was built between Aomon and Bijire so the instrument cables could be run from the test tower on Aomon to the control station on Bijire. The detonations were ordered so that later test areas would suffer minimal fallout from the earlier shots. The Army component, Task Group 7.2, was responsible for construction work. It consisted of the 1220th Provisional Engineer Battalion, with the 1217th and 1218th Composite Service Platoons, the 18th Engineer Construction Company and 1219th Signal Service Platoon; Companies D and E of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade&#x27;s 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment; the 461st Transportation Amphibious Truck Company; 854th Transportation Port Company; 401st CIC Detachment; and the Naval Shore Base Detachment.
==Operations==
As in Operation Crossroads, each detonation was given its own code name, taken from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. All used modified Mark III assemblies, and were detonated from towers. The timing of the detonations was a matter of compromise. The gamma ray measurement experiments required darkness, but the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress drones that would sample the clouds needed daylight to control them. As a compromise, the Sandstone detonations all took place shortly before dawn.

The detonations in the United States&#x27; Sandstone series are listed below:

===X-Ray===

The X-Ray nuclear device used a levitated composite core. It was detonated on Enjebi just before sunrise at 06:17 on April 15, 1948, with a yield of 37 kilotons. The efficiency of utilization of the plutonium was about 35%; that of the uranium-235 was 25% or more. This was somewhat higher than Los Alamos&#x27; prediction. Observers watching from ships in the lagoon saw a brilliant flash and felt the radiant heat. A condensation cloud in diameter quickly enveloped the fireball, which glowed within the cloud. It took 45 to 50 seconds for the thunderous roar of the explosion to reach the observers.

About 20 minutes later, &quot;Bairoko&quot; launched a helicopter to check on the cable winch which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.

===Yoke===

The Yoke nuclear device used a levitated all-uranium-235 core. It was detonated on Aomon just before sunrise on May 1, 1948, at 06:09, a day late due to unfavorable winds. The observers saw a similar flash and felt the same heat as the X-Ray blast, but the wide condensation cloud was larger, and the sound of the explosion more forceful. One observer likened it to the sound of &quot;a paper bag which is forcefully burst in a small room&quot;. They were correct: its yield of 49 kilotons made it the largest nuclear detonation up to that time, but it was considered inefficient and wasteful of the fissile material.

===Zebra===

Zebra, the third test, and the last of the Sandstone series, was detonated on Runit just before sunrise at 06:04 on May 15, 1948. This test was characterized by AEC Chairman David Lilienthal as the &quot;hardest and most important&quot; test of the three. By using one of the B-class initiators, it demonstrated that these could still be used with confidence. The observers perceived the flash and blast as similar to the previous two tests, but this time the base of the condensation cloud was at , which gave the observers an unobstructed view of the fireball, which therefore appeared to be brighter and last longer than the other two. Looks were deceiving: its levitated uranium-235 core produced a yield of 18 kilotons.

The procedures used in the previous tests were repeated, but this time the winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.

==Outcome==

The successful testing of the new cores in the Sandstone tests had a profound effect. Practically every component of the old weapons was rendered obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, Bradbury had halted production of the old cores, and ordered that all effort was to be concentrated on the Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. The more efficient use of fissionable material would increase the nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949. The Mark III bombs were withdrawn from service in 1950. At the same time, new production plants were coming online and the Wigner effect problem had been solved. By May 1951, plutonium production was twelve times that of 1947, while uranium-235 production had increased eight-fold. The Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Major General Kenneth D. Nichols, saw clearly that the era of scarcity was over. He now &quot;recommended that we should be thinking in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds.&quot;

<text>The use of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology and services creates the need for an adaptation layer in order to support information transfer protocols, which are not based on ATM. This adaptation layer defines how to segment higher-layer packets into cells and the reassembly of these packets. Additionally, it defines how to handle various transmission aspects in the ATM layer.

Examples of services that need adaptations are Gigabit Ethernet, IP, Frame Relay, SONET/SDH, UMTS/Wireless, etc.

The main services provided by AAL (ATM Adaptation Layer) are:

*Segmentation and reassembly
*Handling of transmission errors
*Handling of lost and misinserted cell conditions
*Timing and flow control

The following ATM Adaptation Layer protocols (AALs) have been defined by the ITU-T. It is meant that these AALs
will meet a variety of needs. The classification is based on whether a timing relationship must be maintained between source and destination, whether the application requires a constant bit rate, and whether the transfer is connection oriented or connectionless. 

== AAL Type 0 ==
AAL Type 0 (also referred as raw cells) consists of 48 bytes of payload without any reservation for special fields.

== AAL Type 1 ==
AAL Type 1 supports constant bit rate (CBR), synchronous, connection oriented traffic. Examples include T1 (DS1), E1, and x64 kbit/s emulation. It is used for transmitting Class A network traffic, that is, real-time, constant bit rate, connection oriented traffic (example- uncompressed audio and video). Bits are fed in by the application at constant rate and must be delivered to other end with minimum delay, jitter or overhead. The input is stream of bits without message boundaries. For this traffic, error detection protocols cannot be used since timeouts and retransmission causes delay but the missing cells are reported to the application, that must take its own action to recover from them.

== AAL Type 2 ==
AAL Type 2 supports time-dependent Variable Bit Rate (VBR-RT) of connection-oriented, synchronous traffic. Examples include Voice over ATM. AAL2 is also widely used in wireless applications due to the capability of multiplexing voice packets from different users on a single ATM connection.

== AAL Type 3/4 ==
AAL Type 3/4 supports VBR, data traffic, connection-oriented, asynchronous traffic (e.g. X.25 data) or connectionless packet data (e.g. SMDS traffic) with an additional 4-byte header in the information payload of the cell. Examples include Frame Relay and X.25.

== AAL Type 5 ==
AAL Type 5 is similar to AAL 3/4 with a simplified information header scheme. This AAL assumes that the data is sequential from the end user and uses the Payload Type Indicator (PTI) bit to indicate the last cell in a transmission. Examples of services that use AAL 5 are classic IP over ATM, Ethernet Over ATM, SMDS, and LAN Emulation (LANE). AAL 5 is a widely used ATM adaptation layer protocol. This protocol was intended to provide a streamlined transport facility for higher-layer protocols that are connection oriented.

AAL 5 was introduced to:
*reduce protocol processing overhead.
*reduce transmission overhead.
*ensure adaptability to existing transport protocols.

The AAL 5 was designed to accommodate the same variable bit rate, connection-oriented asynchronous traffic or connectionless packet data supported by AAL 3/4, but without the segment tracking and error correction requirements.

<text>Operation Ranger was the fourth American nuclear test series. It was conducted in 1951 and was the first series to be carried out at the Nevada Test Site.
All the bombs were dropped by B-50D bombers and exploded in the open air over Frenchman Flat (Area 5).

These tests centered on the practicality of developing a second generation of nuclear weapons using smaller amounts of valuable nuclear materials. They were planned under the name &quot;Operation Faust.&quot;

The exact locations of the tests are unknown, as they were all air drops. However, the planned ground zero was set at for all except the &quot;Fox&quot; shot, which was &quot;500 feet [] west and 300 feet [] south&quot; in order to minimize damage to the control point.

Footage of the &quot;Buster-Jangle Baker&quot; test is often mislabeled as belonging to the &quot;Ranger Able&quot; test. Both shots can be told apart because the &quot;Buster Baker&quot; test was conducted at Yucca Flat in the daytime, meanwhile &quot;Ranger Able&quot; was conducted at Frenchman Flat in the nighttime. No motion picture of Operation Ranger has ever been declassified.

==History==
The primary purpose of Operation Ranger was to perform experiments in preparation for Operation Greenhouse. As the device to be tested in Greenhouse was in the stockpiling stage with respect to its high explosive system, it was felt that the entire test series could be performed using air dropped weapons.

The test led to the establishment of the Nevada Proving Ground (later Nevada Test Site, now Nevada National Security Site or NNSS). Following this test series it was believed appropriate to conduct tests up to approximately at Nevada instead of at the Pacific Proving Ground.

<doc id="649327" wikidata="Q2119267" url="?curid=649327" title="Senate of the Dominican Republic">
<text>The Senate of the Dominican Republic () is the upper house in the bicameral legislature of the Dominican Republic, and together with the Chamber of Deputies makes up the Congress.

The composition and powers of the Senate are established in Third Title, Chapter 1 in the First Section of the Dominican Constitution. Each province, and the Distrito Nacional, regardless of population, is represented by one senator who serves for a four-year term, with possibility of reelection. The Senate Chamber is located in the west wing of the Congress Palace, in Santo Domingo. The Chamber of Deputies convenes in the east wing of the same building.

The Senate has several advice and consent powers not granted to the Chamber of Deputies, including consenting to treaties, loans and contracts as a precondition to their ratification and consenting to or confirming appointments the members of Chamber of Accounts, Central Electoral Board and ambassadors. The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the Chamber of Deputies. Due to its smaller size and statewide constituencies, the Senate has historically had a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere.

== Membership ==

=== Qualifications ===

The constitution of the Dominican Republic states that to be a senator, one must be a Dominican in full exercise of civil and political rights, have attained twenty-five years old, and be a native of the territorial demarcation that choose or have resided there for at least five consecutive years. In consequence:
* The senators must reside in the territorial demarcation from which they are elected during their elected terms of office;
* Naturalized persons may be elected to the Senate ten years after having acquired Dominican nationality, provided they have resided in the territorial demarcation (jurisdiction) from which they seek election for a period of at least five years prior to their election.

=== Election and Terms ===
The members of the Senate in Dominican Republic are elected by the D&#x27;Hondt method in relationship with the deputies. The terms for serving as senator are unlimited, one term corresponds to four years.

=== Oath ===
The internal rules of procedure of the Senate requires that senators take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. Congress has prescribed the following oath for all senators:

The oath to be provided is:

&quot;&quot;I SWEAR TO GOD, THE HOMELAND AND MY HONOR, RESPECT CONSTITUTION AND LAWS AND COMPLY WITH DIGNITY AND THE FAITHFULLY OTHER DUTIES OF MY OFFICE&quot;,&quot;

what will be answered as follows:

&quot;IF I DO SO, GOD AND THE PEOPLE WHAT OS REWARD IF I NOT, THAT I DEMAND IT. &quot;

== Majority and minority parties ==
The &quot;Majority party&quot; is the political party that either has a majority of seats or can form a coalition or caucus with a majority of seats; if two or more parties are tied, the vice president&#x27;s affiliation determines which party is the majority party. The next-largest party is known as the minority party.

=== Seating ===
The majority party or the party with more senators traditionally sits to the presiding officer&#x27;s right, and the minority party or the party with less senator traditionally sits to the presiding officer&#x27;s left, regardless which party has a majority of seats.

== Functions and Powers ==
The exclusive powers of the Senate are:
# Know the allegations made by the Chamber of Deputies against and public officials. The plea leaves the person removed from office, and may not perform any public function, whether or not popularly elected for a term of ten years. The destitute person shall be subject, if any, to be charged and tried by the ordinary courts, in accordance with the law. This decision shall be taken by a vote of two-thirds of enrollment;
# To approve or disapprove the appointment of ambassadors and heads of permanent missions accredited abroad to submit to the President of the Republic;
# To elect the members of the Chamber of Accounts of the lists presented by the Chamber of Deputies, with the vote of two thirds of the senators present;
# To elect the members of the Central Electoral Board and their deputies, with the vote of two thirds of those present;
# Choose the Ombudsman, their deputies and their deputies from the triads to submit to the House of Representatives, by a vote of two-thirds of those present;
# To authorize, upon request of the President of the Republic, in the absence of agreement permitted, the presence of foreign troops in military exercises in the territory of the Republic, as well as determine the time and conditions of their stay;
# To approve or disapprove of sending troops abroad in peacekeeping missions authorized by international organizations, setting the conditions and duration of the mission.

<text>Operation Greenhouse was the fifth American nuclear test series, the second conducted in 1951 and the first to test principles that would lead to developing thermonuclear weapons (&quot;hydrogen bombs&quot;). Conducted at the new Pacific Proving Ground, on islands of the Enewetak Atoll, it mounted the devices on large steel towers to simulate air bursts. This series of nuclear weapons tests was preceded by Operation Ranger and succeeded by Operation Buster-Jangle.

Operation Greenhouse showcased new and aggressive designs for nuclear weapons. The main idea was to reduce the size, weight, and most importantly, reduce the amount of fissile material necessary for nuclear weapons, while increasing the destructive power. With the Soviet Union&#x27;s first nuclear test a year and half earlier (29 August 1949), the United States had begun stockpiling the new designs before they were actually proven. Thus the success of Operation Greenhouse was vital before the development of thermonuclear weapons could continue.

A number of target buildings, including bunkers, houses and factories were built on Mujinkarikku Islet to test nuclear weapon effects.

==George==

The &quot;George&quot; explosion conducted on May 8, 1951, was the world&#x27;s first thermonuclear burn, though it was just a test design, unsuitable for weaponization. Shaped like a torus, the &quot;George&quot; device had a small amount of heavy isotopes of liquid hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) placed at its center. The vast majority of its yield derived from fission. The energy output from the thermonuclear fusion in this test was insignificant in comparison. The &quot;George&quot; device was more like a &quot;boosted&quot; nuclear bomb than a thermonuclear one. The small amount of heavy deuterium and tritium in this test fused, but its role was to generate a strong flurry of fast neutrons - ones that sparked more fissions in the uranium nuclei that were present, and which also caused fission in uranium-238 - which does not fission under bombardment with slow neutrons, as does uranium-235.

The George design was a &#x27;Classical Super&#x27; prototype with a binary triggering device using radiation implosion upon a cylinder. The design of the triggering system in this test was based on the one patented by Klaus Fuchs and von Neumann in 1946. Its success played a vital role in the history of the Teller–Ulam design.
The George Test had a perfect “bell” Wilson cloud formed near the top of the mushroom cloud.

The &quot;George&quot; test validated the principles which would be used for the first full-scale thermonuclear bomb test, &quot;Ivy Mike&quot;, one year later, on November 1, 1952, at Enewetak Atoll.

==Item==
Conducted on May 25, 1951, &quot;Item&quot; was the first test of an actual boosted fission weapon, nearly doubling the normal yield of a similar non-boosted weapon. In this test, deuterium-tritium (D-T) gas was injected into the enriched uranium core of a nuclear fission bomb. The extreme heat of the fissioning bomb produced thermonuclear fusion reactions within the D-T gas. While not enough to be considered a full nuclear fusion bomb, the large number of high-energy neutrons released nearly doubled the efficiency of the nuclear fission reaction.

==Dog photograph==
The &quot;Dog&quot; explosion is more popularly known for an image taken of those viewing it than the actual explosion itself; the photograph depicts numerous VIPs wearing safety goggles sitting on Adirondack chairs while being illuminated by the flash of the detonation. This photograph takes up the bottom portion of the cover of the 1995 documentary &quot;Trinity and Beyond&quot; by Peter Kuran. The safety goggles worn by all those viewing the test in the picture have become somewhat of a museum collectors item, with a possibility that Norman F. Ramsey may have been present. Cynthia Miller claims that her father, Van Dine, is the first man on the left in the photo. The blast wave safely arrived at the location of the VIPs some 45 seconds after the initially silent flash of the detonation as observed from their position on Parry island.

<text>Operation Upshot–Knothole was a series of eleven nuclear test shots conducted in 1953 at the Nevada Test Site. It followed &quot;Operation Ivy&quot; and preceded &quot;Operation Castle&quot;.

Over 21,000 soldiers took part in the ground exercise Desert Rock V in conjunction with the &quot;Upshot-Knothole Grable&quot; shot. &quot;Grable&quot; was a 280mm Artillery Fired Atomic Projectile (AFAP) shell fired from the &quot;Atomic Cannon&quot; and was viewed by a number of high-ranking military officials.

The test series was notable as containing the first time an AFAP shell was fired (&quot;GRABLE&quot; Shot), the first two shots (both fizzles) by University of California Radiation Laboratory—Livermore (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), and for testing out some of the thermonuclear components that would be used for the massive thermonuclear series of Operation Castle. One primary device (RACER) was tested in thermonuclear system mockup assemblies of TX-14, TX-16, and TX-17/TX-24, to examine and evaluate the behaviour of radiation cases and the compression of the secondary geometries by the primary&#x27;s x-rays prior to full-scale testing during Castle. Following RACER&#x27;s dodgy performance, the COBRA primary was used in the emergency capability ALARM CLOCK, JUGHEAD, RUNT I, RUNT II thermonuclear devices, as well as in the SHRIMP device. RACER IV (as redesigned and proof-tested in the Simon test) was employed as primary for the ZOMBIE, RAMROD and MORGENSTERN devices.

Navy scientist Pauline Silvia conducted experiments during the tests, and would later be profiled in the 2010 documentary Atomic Mom.

<text>Mount Niblock is a mountain in Banff National Park near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada.

The mountain was named in 1904 after John Niblock, a superintendent with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Niblock was an early promoter of tourism in the Rockies and influenced the naming of some of the CPR stops in Western Canada.

Mt. Niblock is a popular scramble in the Lake Louise area and is sometimes combined in the same day with Mount Whyte (), although the latter is a more difficult scramble. The best time for climbing Mt. Niblock is July through September when the normal route is usually free of snow. Attempting it in the spring or early summer may include significant avalanche hazard.

To access Mt. Niblock, follow the trail as it begins near Chateau Lake Louise, passes Mirror Lake and then Lake Agnes. Follow the right hand shore line trail to the far end of the lake until it begins its left turn towards the Big Beehive. Here an obvious path can be found leading to the lower scree slopes and short cliffs. A more detailed route description can be found in &quot;Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies&quot;.

==Geology==
Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Niblock is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, this mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

<doc id="649356" wikidata="Q1337073" url="?curid=649356" title="Putty">
<text>Putty is a material with high plasticity, similar in texture to clay or dough, typically used in domestic construction and repair as a sealant or filler. Although some types of putty (typically those using linseed oil) slowly polymerise and become stiff, many putties can be reworked indefinitely, in contrast to other types of filler which typically set solid relatively rapidly.

== Chemical composition ==
Putty, or lime putty, is made from a mixture of calcium oxide (CaO) and water (H2O) in proportions of 38% and 62% by weight respectively, as result, the solution forms hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2) which takes up about a half of the weight.

The other putty mixture may be a calcium carbonate (CaCO3, 750-850 parts) based with an admixture of CaO (ash calcium, 120-180 parts), white cement (40-60 parts), and talc powders in much lower concentrations (fractions).

== Applications ==

=== Use in construction ===
Putty has been used extensively in glazing for fixing and sealing panes of glass into wooden frames (or sashes), although its use is decreasing with the prevalence of PVC and metal window frames which use synthetic sealants such as silicone. Glazing putty is traditionally made by mixing a base of whiting (finely ground chalk) with linseed oil in various proportions. Historically, white lead was sometimes mixed with the whiting. There are a number of synthetic alternatives such as polybutene-based putties, where the polybutene is a low molecular weight oligomer replacing the linseed oil. Butyl rubber is also added to the mixture to provide some strength and flexibility.

Painter&#x27;s putty is typically a linseed oil-based product used for filling holes, minor cracks, and defacements in wood only.

Putties can also be made intumescent, in which case they are used for firestopping as well as for padding of electrical outlet boxes in fire-resistance rated drywall assemblies. In the latter case, hydrates in the putty produce an endothermic reaction to mitigate heat transfer to the unexposed side.

In woodworking, water-based putties are more commonly used, as these emit very little odour, are more easily cleaned up and are compatible with water-based and latex sealers.

===Two-part hardening putties===
Polyester putty and epoxy putty are thermosetting polymers that can be molded by hand, but become permanently rigid after curing. Pratley Putty is an epoxy putty used primarily for steel bonding. Milliput is another popular multipurpose epoxy putty. Bondo is a polyester-based automotive body filler, which is commonly used in collision repair.

===Plumber&#x27;s putty===
Plumber&#x27;s putty is the common name encompassing a variety of products of completely different compositions, all used for making watertight seals in plumbing. It is a pliable substance used to make watertight seals around faucets and drains. The putty is a basic component of a plumber&#x27;s toolkit and is often used when replacing plumbing fixtures. Plumber&#x27;s putty formulations vary but commonly include powdered clay and linseed oil. Other formulas use limestone, talc, or fish oil. RTV silicone or epoxy sealants may be used in place of putty.

Plumber&#x27;s putty contains mineral oils and/or vegetable oils so it can stain porous materials such as marble or some plastics. The oils can also react chemically with some plastics, slowly making them brittle.

=== Other uses ===
Certain types of putty also have use in the field of terminal ballistics, where the putty can accurately represent the average density of the human body. As such it can be used, for instance, to test the penetrative power of projectiles, or the stopping power of body armour.

Modeling clay and play putty, such as Plasticine and Silly Putty are common toys.

<doc id="649371" wikidata="Q3362836" url="?curid=649371" title="Eupolemus">
<text>Eupolemus () is the earliest Hellenistic Jewish historian whose writing survives from Antiquity. Five (or possibly six) fragments of his work have been preserved in Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot; (hereafter abbreviated as &quot;Praep.&quot;), embedded in quotations from the historian Alexander Polyhistor, and in the &quot;Stromata&quot; (hereafter abbreviated as &quot;Strom.&quot;) of Clement of Alexandria.

A sixth passage which Polyhistor attributes to Eupolemus in Eusebius&#x27; quotations of Polyhistor is usually considered spurious as being dissimilar to the other passages quoted and has come to be called &quot;Pseudo-Eupolemus&quot;.

Style and vocabulary indicate the writing as also originally in Greek and the date of composition of the seemingly genuine passages is about 158/7 BC. That the author dates his work by the Seleucids rather than the Ptolemies suggests Palestinian rather than Egyptian origin. It has been speculated that the author might be the Eupolemus who was ambassador of Judas Maccabeus to Rome as found in 1 Maccabees 8.17f and 2 Maccabees 4.11. 

==Writings==
The fragments usually considered Eupolemus&#x27; genuine work are:
* A statement that Moses was the first wise man, that he taught the alphabet to the Jews who passed it on to the Phoenicians who passed it on to the Greeks, and that Moses first wrote laws for the Jews (&quot;Praep.&quot; 9.26.1).
* Some chronology about the period from Moses to David and some details of David&#x27;s arrangements for building the temple followed by purported transcripts of letters exchanged between King Solomon and &quot;Vaphres King of Egypt&quot; and between Solomon and &quot;Souron the King of Tyre&quot;, the Biblical Hiram (&quot;Praep.&quot; 9.30.1–34.18).
* A short statement about gold shields made by Solomon (&quot;Praep.&quot; 9.34.20).
* A very short account of the persecution of the prophet Jeremiah by King &quot;Jonachim&quot; who seems to correspond to the Biblical kings Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah followed by a short fictionalized account of the fall of Judah ending with the note that Jeremiah preserved the ark and the tablets (&quot;Praep.&quot; 9.39.2–5).
* A chronological summary indicating 5,149 years from Adam to the 5th year of Demetrius (&quot;Strom.&quot; 1.141,4).

==Writing of Pseudo-Eupolemus==

The fragment usually known as &quot;Pseudo-Eupolemus&quot; (&quot;Praep.&quot; 9.17.2–9) relates:
* The Assyrian city of Babylon [sic] was built by giants who escaped the Flood and they also built the tower. After its destruction the giants were scattered.
* There follows a summary of Abraham&#x27;s career based on the Biblical account with some changes and details similar to those found in the &quot;Genesis Apocryphon&quot; and Josephus and in Enochite tradition. Abraham is particularly knowledgeable about astronomy and when he goes down to Egypt he teaches astrology to the Egyptian priests and explains that Enoch first discovered astrology.
* Then follows a puzzling passage which seems to have little to do with the context and may be garbled:
::For the Babylonians say that the first was Belus, who is the same as Cronus, and that of him were born sons named Belus and Canaan. This Canaan fathered the father of the Phoenicians, whose son was Chum/Chus, called by the Greeks Asbolus and was the father of the Ethiopians and the brother of Mestraim, the ancestor of the Egyptians.

:Traditionally many translators have emended &quot;Canaan&quot; to &quot;Cham&quot;, that is &quot;Ham&quot; since in Genesis 10.6 Ham is the father of Cush and Mizraim. However the author here claims to be relating Babylonian tradition, not Hebrew tradition, for whatever that is worth. &quot;Asbolus&quot; means &#x27;sooty&#x27;.

:Robert Doran in his translation in &quot;The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha&quot;, Volume 2, emends &quot;einai Kronon&quot; &#x27;is the same as Cronus&#x27; to &quot;einai Kronou&quot; &#x27;is son of Cronus&#x27; noting that in no other text is anyone called Belus ever equated with Cronus. However, in Sanchuniathon&#x27;s Historie, we find the gods Cronus &amp; Elus in the same place on the genealogical tree, even though Elus is equated to El in this case.

* The account concludes by indicating that the Greeks relate that Atlas discovered astrology but that Atlas is really Enoch and that Enoch learned from the angels of God.

Robert Doran gives reason for believing that this fragment may be part of the genuine work of Eupolemus despite earlier doubts.

<text>Mount Whyte is a mountain in Alberta, Canada located in Banff National Park, near Lake Louise. The mountain can be seen from the Trans-Canada Highway, and offers views of the Valley of the Ten Peaks, including the Chateau Lake Louise. The mountain is also visible from the hiking trail that skirts the northern shore of Lake Agnes.

The mountain was named in 1898 by Sir William Methuen after William Whyte, a representative of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

==Climbing==
Mt. Whyte is usually combined with Mount Niblock () when done as a scramble. However, while Mt. Niblock is rated a moderate scramble, Mt. Whyte is much more difficult due to additional exposure and loose rock. The scramble should not be attempted in snowy conditions due to considerable fall distance which would likely prove fatal.

For rock climbers, the Perren Route (II 5.6) is another option. While mostly a scramble as well, a short section of difficult climbing near the top in addition to route finding challenges and loose rock will not make it an easy ascent.

==Geology==
Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Whyte is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Whyte is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C.

<doc id="649382" wikidata="Q506422" url="?curid=649382" title="Pareidolia">
<text>Pareidolia (; ) is the tendency for perception to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous stimulus, usually visual, so that one detects an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none. Pareidolia is a type of apophenia.

Common examples include perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations; seeing faces in inanimate objects; or lunar pareidolia like the Man in the Moon or the Moon rabbit. The concept of pareidolia may extend to include hidden messages in recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds, and hearing voices (mainly indistinct) or music in random noise, such as that produced by air conditioners or by fans. Face pareidolia has also been demonstrated in rhesus macaques.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from the Greek words &quot;&quot; (, &quot;beside, alongside, instead [of]&quot;) and the noun (, &quot;image, form, shape&quot;).

The German word was used in articles by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum—for example in his 1866 paper &quot;&quot; (&quot;On Delusion of the Senses&quot;). When Kahlbaum&#x27;s paper was reviewed the following year (1867) in &quot;The Journal of Mental Science&quot;, Volume 13, was translated into English as &quot;pareidolia&quot;, and noted to be synonymous with the terms &quot;...changing hallucination, partial hallucination, [and] perception of secondary images.&quot;

== Link to other conditions ==
Pareidolia correlates with age and is frequent among patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

== Explanations ==
Pareidolia can cause people to interpret random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces. A 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 ms) activation of the fusiform face area at a time and location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon.

A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. These results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.

Pareidolia was found to affect brain function and brain waves. In a 2022 study, EEG records show that responses in the frontal and occipitotemporal cortexes begin prior to when one recognizes faces and later, when they are not recognized. By displaying these proactive brain waves, scientists can then have a basis for data rather than relying on self-reported sightings. 

These studies help to explain why people generally identify a few lines and a circle as a &quot;face&quot; so quickly and without hesitation. Cognitive processes are activated by the &quot;face-like&quot; object which alerts the observer to both the emotional state and identity of the subject, even before the conscious mind begins to process or even receive the information. A &quot;stick figure face&quot;, despite its simplicity, can convey mood information, and be drawn to indicate emotions such as happiness or anger. This robust and subtle capability is hypothesized to be the result of natural selection favoring people most able to quickly identify the mental state, for example, of threatening people, thus providing the individual an opportunity to flee or attack preemptively. This ability, though highly specialized for the processing and recognition of &quot;human&quot; emotions, also functions to determine the demeanor of wildlife.

== Examples ==
=== Mimetoliths ===

A mimetolithic pattern is a pattern created by rocks that may come to mimic recognizable forms through the random processes of formation, weathering and erosion. A well-known example is the Face on Mars, a rock formation on Mars that resembled a human face in certain satellite photos. Most mimetoliths are much larger than the subjects they resemble, such as a cliff profile that looks like a human face.

Picture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns, such as banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), or dendritic or color variations, resulting in what appear to be miniature scenes on a cut section, which is then used for jewelry.

Chert nodules, concretions, or pebbles may in certain cases be mistakenly identified as skeletal remains, egg fossils, or other antiquities of organic origin by amateur enthusiasts.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese researcher Chonosuke Okamura self-published a series of reports titled &quot;Original Report of the Okamura Fossil Laboratory&quot;, in which he described tiny inclusions in polished limestone from the Silurian period (425 mya) as being preserved fossil remains of tiny humans, gorillas, dogs, dragons, dinosaurs and other organisms, all of them only millimeters long, leading him to claim, &quot;There have been no changes in the bodies of mankind since the Silurian period... except for a growth in stature from 3.5 mm to 1,700 mm.&quot; Okamura&#x27;s research earned him an Ig Nobel Prize (a parody of the Nobel Prize) in biodiversity in 1996.

Some sources describe various mimetolithic features on Pluto, including a heart-shaped region.

===Clouds===

Seeing shapes in cloud patterns is another example of this phenomenon. Rogowitz and Voss (1990) showed a relationship between seeing shapes in cloud patterns and fractal dimension. They varied the fractal dimension of the boundary contour from 1.2 to 1.8, and found that the lower the fractal dimension, the more likely people were to report seeing nameable shapes of animals, faces, and fantasy creatures. From above, pareidolia may be perceived in satellite imagery of tropical cyclones. Notably hurricanes Matthew and Milton gained much attention for resembling a human face or skull when viewed from the side. 

=== Mars canals ===
A notable example of pareidolia occurred in 1877, when observers using telescopes to view the surface of Mars thought that they saw faint straight lines, which were then interpreted by some as canals. It was theorized that the canals were possibly created by sentient beings. This created a sensation. In the next few years better photographic techniques and stronger telescopes were developed and applied, which resulted in new images in which the faint lines disappeared, and the canal theory was debunked as an example of pareidolia.

=== Lunar surface ===

Many cultures recognize pareidolic images in the disc of the full moon, including the human face known as the Man in the Moon in many Northern Hemisphere cultures and the Moon rabbit in East Asian and indigenous American cultures. Other cultures see a walking figure carrying a wide burden on their back, including in Germanic tradition, Haida mythology, and Latvian mythology.

=== Projective tests ===
The Rorschach inkblot test uses pareidolia in an attempt to gain insight into a person&#x27;s mental state. The Rorschach is a projective test that elicits thoughts or feelings of respondents that are &quot;projected&quot; onto the ambiguous inkblot images. Rorschach inkblots have low-fractal-dimension boundary contours, which may elicit general shape-naming behaviors, serving as vehicles for projected meanings.

===Banknotes===
Owing to the way designs are engraved and printed, occurrences of pareidolia have occasionally been reported in banknotes.

One example is the 1954 Canadian Landscape Canadian dollar banknote series, known among collectors as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Head&quot; variety of the initial print runs. The obverse of the notes features what appears to be an exaggerated grinning face, formed from patterns in the hair of Queen Elizabeth II. The phenomenon generated enough attention for revised designs to be issued in 1956, which removed the effect.

=== Literature ===
Renaissance authors have shown a particular interest in pareidolia. In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;, for example, Prince Hamlet points at the sky and &quot;demonstrates&quot; his supposed madness in this exchange with Polonius:

&lt;poem&gt;HAMLET
:Do you see yonder cloud that&#x27;s almost in the shape of a camel?
POLONIUS
:By th&#x27;Mass and &#x27;tis, like a camel indeed.
HAMLET
:Methinks it is a weasel.
POLONIUS
:It is backed like a weasel.
HAMLET
:Or a whale.
POLONIUS
:Very like a whale.&lt;/poem&gt;
Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a short story called &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot; in which a face seen in the side of a mountain (based on the real-life The Old Man of the Mountain) is revered by a village.

=== Art ===

Renaissance artists often used pareidolia in paintings and drawings: Andrea Mantegna, Leonardo da Vinci, Giotto, Hans Holbein, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, and many more have shown images—often human faces—that due to pareidolia appear in objects or clouds.

In his notebooks, Leonardo da Vinci wrote of pareidolia as a device for painters, writing:
&quot;Salem&quot;, a 1908 painting by Sydney Curnow Vosper, gained notoriety due to a rumour that it contained a hidden face, that of the devil. This led many commentators to visualize a demonic face depicted in the shawl of the main figure, despite the artist&#x27;s denial that any faces had deliberately been painted into the shawl.

Surrealist artists such as Salvador Dalí would intentionally use pareidolia in their works, often in the form of a hidden face.
=== Architecture ===

Two 13th-century edifices in Turkey display architectural use of shadows of stone carvings at the entrance. Outright pictures are avoided in Islam but tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, so designed &quot;accidental&quot; silhouettes of carved stone tessellations became a creative escape. 
*Niğde Alaaddin Mosque in Niğde, Turkey (1223), with its &quot;mukarnas&quot; art where the shadows of three-dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance form a chiaroscuro drawing of a woman&#x27;s face with a crown and long hair appearing at a specific time, at some specific days of the year. 
*Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital in Sivas, Turkey (1229), shows shadows of the three-dimensional ornaments of both entrances of the mosque part, to cast a giant shadow of a praying man that changes pose as the sun moves, as if to illustrate what the purpose of the building is. Another detail is the difference in the impressions of the clothing of the two shadow-men indicating two different styles, possibly to tell who is to enter through which door.
=== Religion ===

There have been many instances of perceptions of religious imagery and themes, especially the faces of religious figures, in ordinary phenomena. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, the word Allah, or other religious phenomena: in September 2007 in Singapore, for example, a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers to pay homage to the &quot;Monkey god&quot; (either Sun Wukong or Hanuman) in the monkey tree phenomenon.

Publicity surrounding sightings of religious figures and other surprising images in ordinary objects has spawned a market for such items on online auctions like eBay. One famous instance was a grilled cheese sandwich with the face of the Virgin Mary.

During the September 11 attacks, television viewers supposedly saw the face of Satan in clouds of smoke billowing out of the World Trade Center after it was struck by the airplane. Another example of face recognition pareidolia originated in the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, when a few observers claimed to see Jesus in the flames.

While attempting to validate the imprint of a crucified man on the Shroud of Turin as Jesus, a variety of objects have been described as being visible on the linen. These objects include a number of plant species, a coin with Roman numerals, and multiple insect species. In an experimental setting using a picture of plain linen cloth, participants who had been told that there could possibly be visible words in the cloth, collectively saw 2 religious words. Those told that the cloth was of some religious importance saw 12 religious words, and those who were also told that it was of religious importance, but also given suggestions of possible religious words, saw 37 religious words. The researchers posit that the reason the Shroud has been said to have so many different symbols and objects is because it was already deemed to have the imprint of Jesus prior to the search for symbols and other imprints in the cloth, and therefore it was simply pareidolia at work.

=== Computer vision ===

Pareidolia can occur in computer vision, specifically in image recognition programs, in which vague clues can spuriously detect images or features. In the case of an artificial neural network, higher-level features correspond to more recognizable features, and enhancing these features brings out what the computer sees. These examples of pareidolia reflect the training set of images that the network has &quot;seen&quot; previously.

Striking visuals can be produced in this way, notably in the DeepDream software, which falsely detects and then exaggerates features such as eyes and faces in any image. The features can be further exaggerated by creating a feedback loop where the output is used as the input for the network. (The adjacent image was created by iterating the loop 50 times.) Additionally the output can be modified such as slightly zooming in to create an animation of the images perspective flying through the surrealistic imagery.

=== Auditory ===
In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, detailing what he believed was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP has been described as auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, one to the listener&#x27;s left and the other to his right, producing a phase offset in time between the speakers. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener&#x27;s mind.

== Deliberate practical use ==
=== Medical education, radiology images ===

Medical educators sometimes teach medical students and resident physicians (doctors in training) to use pareidolia and patternicity to learn to recognize human anatomy on radiology imaging studies.

Examples include assessing radiographs (X-ray images) of the human vertebral spine. Patrick Foye, M.D., professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Rutgers University, New Jersey Medical School, has written that pareidolia is used to teach medical trainees to assess for spinal fractures and spinal malignancies (cancers). When viewing spinal radiographs, normal bony anatomic structures resemble the face of an owl. (The spinal pedicles resemble an owl&#x27;s eyes and the spinous process resembles an owl&#x27;s beak.) But when cancer erodes the bony spinal pedicle, the radiographic appearance changes such that now that eye of the owl seems missing or closed, which is called the &quot;winking owl sign&quot;. Another common pattern is a &quot;Scottie dog sign&quot; on a spinal X-ray.

In 2021, Foye again published in the medical literature on this topic, in a medical journal article called &quot;Baby Yoda: Pareidolia and Patternicity in Sacral MRI and CT Scans&quot;. Here, he introduced a novel way of visualizing the sacrum when viewing MRI magnetic resonance imaging and CT scans (computed tomography scans). He noted that in certain image slices the human sacral anatomy resembles the face of &quot;Baby Yoda&quot; (also called Grogu), a fictional character from the television show &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. Sacral openings for exiting nerves (sacral foramina) resemble Baby Yoda&#x27;s eyes, while the sacral canal resembles Baby Yoda&#x27;s mouth.

=== In popular culture ===

In January 2017, an anonymous user placed an eBay auction of a Cheeto that looked like the gorilla Harambe. Bidding began at , but the Cheeto was eventually sold for .

Starting from 2021, an Internet meme emerged around an online game called &quot;Among Us&quot;, where users presented everyday items such as dogs, statues, garbage cans, big toes, and pictures of the Boomerang Nebula that looked like the game&#x27;s &quot;crewmate&quot; protagonists. In May 2021, an eBay user named Tav listed a Chicken McNugget shaped like a crewmate from &quot;Among Us&quot; for online auction. The Chicken McNugget was sold for to an anonymous buyer.

== Related phenomena ==
A shadow person (also known as a shadow figure, shadow being or black mass) is often attributed to pareidolia. It is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the paranormal or supernatural as the presence of a spirit or other entity.

Pareidolia is also what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have seen ghosts.

<doc id="649383" wikidata="Q255779" url="?curid=649383" title="Foolishness for Christ">
<text>Foolishness for Christ (; ) refers to behavior such as giving up all one&#x27;s worldly possessions upon joining an ascetic order or religious life, or deliberately flouting society&#x27;s conventions to serve a religious purpose—particularly of Christianity. Such individuals have historically been known as both &quot;holy fools&quot; and &quot;blessed fools&quot;. The term &quot;fool&quot; connotes what is perceived as feeblemindedness, and &quot;blessed&quot; or &quot;holy&quot; refers to innocence in the eyes of God.

The term &quot;fools for Christ&quot; derives from the writings of Paul the Apostle. Desert Fathers and other saints acted the part of Holy Fools, as have the &quot;yurodivy&quot; (or iurodstvo) of Eastern Orthodox asceticism. Fools for Christ often employ shocking and unconventional behavior to challenge accepted norms, deliver prophecies, or to mask their piety.

== Old Testament ==
Certain prophets of the Old Testament who exhibited signs of strange behaviour are considered by some scholars to be predecessors of &quot;Fools for Christ&quot;. The prophet Isaiah walked naked and barefoot for about three years, predicting a forthcoming captivity in Egypt (); the prophet Ezekiel lay before a stone, which symbolized beleaguered Jerusalem, and though God instructed him to eat bread baked on human waste, ultimately he asked to use cow dung instead (); Hosea married a harlot to symbolize the infidelity of Israel before God ().

By the opinion of certain scholars, these prophets were not counted as fools by their contemporaries, as they just carried out separate actions to attract people&#x27;s attention and to awake their repentance.

== New Testament ==
According to Christian ideas, &quot;foolishness&quot; included consistent rejection of worldly cares and imitating Christ, who endured mockery and humiliation from the crowd. The spiritual meaning of &quot;foolishness&quot; from the early ages of Christianity was closely related to that of rejection of common social rules of hypocrisy, brutality and quest for power and gains.

By the words of Anthony the Great: &quot;Here comes the time, when people will behave like madmen, and if they see anybody who does not behave like that, they will rebel against him and say: &#x27;You are mad&#x27;, — because he is not like them.&quot;

===Paul the Apostle===
Part of the Biblical basis for it can be seen in the words of the Apostle Paul in , which famously says:

:&quot;We are &quot;fools for Christ&#x27;s sake&quot;, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.&quot; (KJV).

And also:

:&quot;For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God&#x27;s sight. As it is written: &#x27;He catches the wise in their craftiness.&#x27;&quot; ()

:&quot;For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.&quot; ()

:&quot;For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.&quot; ()

== Western Christianity ==

In Western Christianity there have been several saints who lived lives that were rather eccentric and seemingly foolish. Among the earliest of them was St. Nicholas of Trani, a young homeless man who died in 1094 AD. He apparently never stopped repeating the phrase &#x27;Kyrie Eleison&#x27; and behaved foolishly. Similarly Blessed Peter of Foligno lived in voluntary poverty and was deemed crazy. 

Other notable lay men who led saintly albeit eccentric lifestyles were Blessed Peter of Trevi, Teobaldo Roggeri, Benedict Joseph Labre, St. Salaun of Brittany Ludovico Morbioli and Casimiro Barello among others. The key characteristics of foolishness for Christ in Western Christianity are sleeping rough (outdoors) and homelessness, a minimalistic lifestyle with very few if any possessions and a strict dedication to prayer and self-renunciation.

Some ascetics are known as mendicants and are organised into mendicant orders. The most famous example in the Western church is Francis of Assisi, whose order was known for following the teachings of Christ and walking in his footsteps. Thus, upon joining the order, Franciscans gave away all possessions and focused on preaching in the streets to the common man.

Servant of God, Brother Juniper, an early follower of the Franciscan order, was known for taking the doctrine of the Franciscans to the extreme. Whenever anyone asked for any of his possessions, he freely gave them away, including his clothes. He once even cut off the bells from his altar-cloth and gave them to a poor woman. His fellow Franciscans had to watch him closely, and strictly forbade him from giving away his clothes. While such behaviors were embarrassing to his brothers, he was also recognized as a pure example of the Franciscan order and thus esteemed.

&quot;The Little Flowers of Saint Francis of Assisi&quot;, which documents the oral traditions of the Franciscans, told several stories of &quot;Brother Juniper&quot;. The most famous of these is the story of how Brother Juniper, when he heard a sick brother request a pig&#x27;s foot as a meal, took a kitchen knife and ran into the forest, where he saw a herd of swine feeding. There, he quickly cut the foot off of one of the swine and carried it back to the brother, leaving the swine to die. This angered the herdsman, who complained to Saint Francis. Saint Francis confronted Brother Juniper, who joyfully exclaimed, &quot;It is true, sweet father, that I did cut off the swine&#x27;s foot. I will tell thee the reason. I went out of charity to visit the brother who is sick.&quot; Brother Juniper likewise explained to the angry herdsman who, seeing the &quot;charity, simplicity, and humility&quot; (Hudleston, 1953) in Brother Juniper&#x27;s heart, forgave him and delivered the rest of the pig to the brothers.

== Eastern Christianity ==
The Holy Fool or &quot;yuródivyy&quot; (юродивый) is the Russian version of foolishness for Christ, a peculiar form of Eastern Orthodox asceticism. The yurodivy is a Holy Fool, one who acts intentionally foolish in the eyes of men. The term implies behaviour &quot;which is caused neither by mistake nor by feeble-mindedness, but is deliberate, irritating, even provocative.&quot;

In his book &quot;Holy Fools in Byzantium and Beyond&quot;, Ivanov described &quot;holy fool&quot; as a term for a person who &quot;feigns insanity, pretends to be foolish, or who provokes shock or outrage by his deliberate unruliness.&quot; He explained that such conduct qualifies as holy foolery only if the audience believes that the individual is sane, moral, and pious. The Eastern Orthodox Church holds that holy fools voluntarily take up the guise of insanity in order to conceal their perfection from the world, and thus avoid praise.

Some characteristics that were commonly seen in holy fools were going around half-naked, being homeless, speaking in riddles, being believed to be clairvoyant and a prophet, and occasionally being disruptive and challenging to the point of seeming immoral (though always to make a point).

Ivanov argued that, unlike in the past, modern yurodivy are generally aware that they look pathetic in others’ eyes. They strive to preempt this contempt through exaggerated self-humiliation, and following such displays they let it be known both that their behaviors were staged and that their purpose was to disguise their superiority over their audience.

Fools for Christ are often given the title of Blessed (), which does not necessarily mean that the individual is less than a saint, but rather points to the blessings from God that they are believed to have acquired.
The Eastern Orthodox Church records Isidora Barankis of Egypt (d. 369) among the first Holy Fools. However, the term was not popularized until the coming of Symeon of Emesa, who is considered to be a patron saint of holy fools. In Greek, the term for Holy Fool is &quot;salos&quot;.

The practice was recognised in the hagiography of fifth-century Byzantium, and it was extensively adopted in Muscovite Russia, probably in the 14th century. The madness of the Holy Fool was ambiguous, and could be real or simulated. He (or she) was believed to have been divinely inspired, and was therefore able to say truths which others could not, normally in the form of indirect allusions or parables. He had a particular status in regard to the Tsars, as a figure not subject to earthly control or judgement.
The first reported fool-for-Christ in Russia was St. Procopius (Prokopiy), who came from the lands of the Holy Roman Empire to Novgorod, then moved to Ustyug, pretending to be a fool and leading an ascetic way of life (slept naked on church-porches, prayed throughout the whole night, received food only from poor people). He was abused and beaten, but finally won respect and became venerated after his death.

The Russian Orthodox Church numbers 36 &quot;yurodivye&quot; among its saints, starting from Procopius of Ustyug, and most prominently Basil Fool for Christ, who gives his name to Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral in Moscow. One of the best-known modern examples in the Russian Church is perhaps St Xenia of Saint Petersburg.

== Common phrases or epithets ==
===Crazy for God ===
&quot;Crazy for God&quot; is an expression sometimes used in the United States and other English speaking countries to convey a similar idea to &quot;Foolishness for Christ.&quot; It has been especially connected to the Unification Church of the United States. In &quot;The Way of God&#x27;s Will&quot;, a collection of sayings popular among church members, Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon is quoted as saying: &quot;We leaders should leave the tradition that we have become crazy for God.&quot;

In 1979 Unification Church critic Christopher Edwards titled a memoir about his experiences in the six months he spent as a church member: &quot;Crazy for God: The nightmare of cult life.&quot;

In 2007, author Frank Schaeffer titled his autobiography &quot;Crazy for God: How I Grew Up as One of the Elect, Helped Found the Religious Right, and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back&quot;. It tells of his upbringing as the son of a well-known evangelical minister and his later conversion to the Greek Orthodox Church.

In the same year Stephen Prothero, author and chairman of Boston University&#x27;s Department of Religion, wrote in the &quot;Harvard Divinity Bulletin&quot;: &quot;I am crazy for people who are crazy for God: people nearly as inscrutable to me as divinity, who leave wives and children to become forest-dwelling monks in Thailand, who wander naked across the belly of India in search of self-realization, who speak in tongues and take up serpents in Appalachia because the Bible says they can.&quot;

==Modern theology==
One of the more recent works in theology is &quot;Fools for Christ&quot; by Jaroslav Pelikan. Through six essays dealing with various &quot;fools,&quot; Pelikan explores the motif of fool-for-Christ in relationship to the problem of understanding the numinous:

The Holy is too great and too terrible when encountered directly for men of normal sanity to be able to contemplate it comfortably. Only those who cannot care for the consequences run the risk of the direct confrontation of the Holy. 
==The &quot;yurodivy&quot; in art and literature==
There are a number of references to the &quot;yurodivy&quot; holy fools in 19th century Russian literature. The holy fool Nikolka is a character in Pushkin&#x27;s play &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera based on the play. In Pushkin&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot;, the character of Evgenii is based in the tradition of the holy fools in his confrontation with the animated statue of Peter the Great.

The yurodivy appears several times in the novels of Dostoevsky. &quot;The Idiot&quot; explores the ramifications of placing a holy fool (the compassionate and insightful epileptic Prince Myshkin) in a secular world dominated by vanity and desire. According to Joseph Frank &quot;though the gentlemanly and well-educated prince bears no external resemblance to these eccentric figures, he does possess their traditional gift of spiritual insight, which operates instinctively, below any level of conscious awareness or doctrinal commitment.&quot; In &quot;Demons&quot;, the madwoman Marya Lebyadkina displays many of the attributes of the holy fool, as do the characters of Sofya Marmeladova in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and Lizaveta in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;.

Another fool-for-Christ is Grisha in Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Childhood. Boyhood. Youth&quot;. Callis and Dewey described Grisha as follows:

:He was an awesome figure: emaciated, barefoot and in rags, with eyes that &quot;looked right through you&quot; and long, shaggy hair. He always wore chains around his neck...Neighborhood children would sometimes run after him, laughing and calling out his name. Older persons, as a rule, viewed Grisha with respect and a little fear, especially when he suffered one of his periodic seizures and began to shout and rant. At such times adult bystanders would crowd around and listen, for they believed that the Holy Spirit was working through him.

Grisha&#x27;s abnormal social conduct, seizures, and rants were common behaviors amongst holy fools. The esteem expressed by adults was also common. In his autobiography, Tolstoy expressed such esteem in reaction to overhearing Grisha praying:

:“Oh Great Christian Grisha! Your faith was so strong that you felt the nearness of God; your love was so great that words flowed of their own will from your lips, and you did not verify them by reason. And what high praise you gave to the majesty of God, when, not finding any words, you prostrated yourself on the ground.”
A further example is Kasyan in the ninth sketch from Turgenev&#x27;s Sketches from a Hunter&#x27;s Album. The protagonist&#x27;s coachman describes him as &quot;one of those holy men,&quot; who lives by himself in the forest, strictly differentiates between eating bread which he calls &quot;God&#x27;s gift to man&quot; and &quot;tame creatures&quot; on the one hand, and birds &quot;of the free air&quot; and creatures &quot;of the forest and of the field&quot; on the other hand, the latter of which he sees as being sinful.

<doc id="649384" wikidata="Q356212" url="?curid=649384" title="Fossil Group">
<text>Fossil Group, Inc., is an American fashion design and manufacturer founded in 1984 by Tom Kartsotis and based in Richardson, Texas. Their brands include Fossil, Relic, Michele Watch, Skagen Denmark, Misfit, WSI, and Zodiac Watches. Fossil also makes licensed accessories for brands such as BMW, Puma, Emporio Armani, Michael Kors, DKNY, Diesel, Kate Spade New York, Tory Burch, Chaps, and Armani Exchange.

Kosta Kartsotis, brother of Tom Kartsotis and CEO, owns approximately 12.5% of Fossil stock. The company name is the nickname the brothers gave their father.

==Company history==
Fossil was founded in 1984 as Overseas Products International by Tom Kartsotis, a former Texas A&amp;M University student living in Dallas from a suggestion by his older brother, Kosta Kartsotis, a merchandising executive at Sanger-Harris. Kosta told his younger brother about the potential large profits that could be made in importing retail goods made in the Far East, specifically in importing moderately-priced fashion watches. Their main product was fashion watches with a retro look. In 1990, they introduced leather goods under the Fossil brand, and the Relic line of watches.

Fossil had its initial public offering in 1993.

Zodiac Watches was a Swiss brand that had been operating since 1882 when Fossil acquired it from Genender International in 2001 for $4.7 million. Fossil&#x27;s desire to establish a Swiss presence led to the purchase of the Zodiac Watch brand and a complete retooling of that line to reflect a retro modern 1970s style in a higher end watch. The 2004 purchase of Michele Watch completed the cycle by offering a high-end Swiss watch with a designer flair.

In September 2007, Fossil was accused of infringing a patent owned by Financial Innovations Systems, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Texas. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount and dismissed shortly thereafter.
The Watch Station International chain was purchased from Luxottica/Sunglass Hut in December 2007.

Fossil has design studios in Biel, Switzerland, close to Rolex as well as manufacturing facilities in China and distribution centers in Dallas, Germany, and Asia.

In 2012, Fossil, Inc. agreed to purchase Skagen Designs and some of its partners for approximately $225 million in cash and 150,000 Fossil shares. The total value paid by Fossil would be approximately $236.8 million.

In early 2013, Fossil introduced their upscale and more expensive &quot;Fossil Swiss&quot; line of watches which are made in Switzerland.

In November 2015, Fossil acquired Misfit for $260 million, with plans to incorporate Misfit&#x27;s technology into traditional-looking watches.

In 2021, the company cut their number of employees from 10,200 to 7,500.

In 2022, Fossil Group appointed Lisa Marie Pillette as Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer.

In January 2024, the company announced that it would leave the smartwatch business. 

==Licensed business==

Fossil has had financial success with its own brands and this success has led a number of deals for licensed watch lines. In 2001, Fossil collaborated with designer Philippe Starck to create the Starck with Fossil watch collection. The collection features ultra-modern designs and unique movements. Other licensed watch lines that Fossil designs, manufactures, and distributes include Burberry, DKNY, Emporio Armani, Armani Exchange, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel, Frank Gehry, Karl Lagerfeld, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Callaway Golf, Davis Cup, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Skagen Designs, Michele, and Adidas. When referencing Fossil&#x27;s watch lines, they are generally regarded as a &quot;manufacturer&quot;; Fossil also designs and manufactures their own movements under the Fossil Twist Line.

==Special products==

In addition, the company produces collectibles, some of which are based on popular films or pop culture characters. Previous designs include: Superman; Batman; Wonder Woman; Elvis Presley; Pirates of the Caribbean; Flash; Green Lantern; Snoopy, Pokémon; Star Wars; Chronicles of Narnia; Cars; The Matrix and Harry Potter.

In 2003, the company released the &quot;Fossil Wrist PDA&quot; wristwatch computer which is a tiny Palm OS-based PDA worn like a watch. In 2006, Fossil released a Caller ID watch.

In 2006, Fossil teamed up with the National Football League in the United States to make the official watch collection for each team. Fossil also caters to special markets that seek to customize products.

==Websites==
Fossil Groups&#x27; e-commerce website, fossil.com, has a total of 364 stores as of the 2010 fiscal year review that cut across the world such as Fossil UK, Fossil USA, Fossil India, and even in Africa within nations like Fossil South Africa, and Fossil Nigeria.
==Awards==
Fossil won awards for &quot;Most Effective Use of Online Creative&quot; and &quot;Best of Show&quot; awards for the 6th Annual DFWIMA Excellence in Interactive Marketing (in 2006).

Fossil has also been voted one of the Top 100 Best Companies to work for in the U.K in 2013 and 2015.

In 2016, Fossil won Fashion Tech Collection of the Year for their connected designer smartwatches and jewellery. Their analog smartwatches and connected jewellery span across their licensed brands such as Diesel, Emporio Armani, Michael Kors, and Kate Spade.

<text>The Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that strengthened the mandatory retirement provisions previously instituted by the Judicial Pensions Act 1959 for members of the British judiciary.

While the 1959 Act forbade service past age 75 by any judges appointed thereafter (Lord Denning being the last exempt jurist in England, retiring in 1982. while in Scotland John Cameron, Lord Cameron retired in 1985), the 1993 Act made the ordinary retirement age 70, and while enabling a minister (presumably the Lord Chancellor) to allow individual judges to remain in office until 75, it expressly forbids persons aged over 75 to hold any judicial post whatsoever. An exception is the post of Lord Chancellor, a political appointee (although the role is no longer judicial).

<text>Megan Martha White (born December 10, 1974) is an American musician who achieved international fame as the drummer of the rock duo the White Stripes. Though she typically performed backing vocals for the band, she occasionally sang lead, including in the song &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot;.

White began playing the drums on Bastille Day in 1997, and she formed the White Stripes with then-husband Jack White that same year. Their 2001 breakthrough album, &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, brought them international fame. Her simultaneous solo ventures include acting, appearing in the 2003 film &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot; and a 2006 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and briefly modeling. While the band were on tour in support of their 2007 album, &quot;Icky Thump&quot;, she suffered a bout of acute anxiety, and the remaining dates of the tour were canceled. The band disbanded in 2011 following a lengthy hiatus and she ceased performing.

White is a key artist of the 2000s garage rock revival, and her style of drumming has been called &quot;minimalistic&quot; and &quot;simplistic&quot; by critics. Reviews of her playing were initially ambivalent, but it has earned retrospective praise and continues to be discussed. She is also noted for her elusive media image, calling herself &quot;very shy&quot; and reclusive. With the White Stripes, she won a Brit Award and six Grammy Awards. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included her on their &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot; list. She and Jack were nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023, but were not inducted; they were again nominated in 2025.

== Early life ==
Megan Martha White was born in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan, on December 10, 1974 to parents Catherine and Walter Hackett White Jr. She has an older sister, Heather. She was not &quot;brought up in any religion&quot;. She attended Grosse Pointe North High School and, according to one classmate, was &quot;always the quiet, obviously artistic type, and she just kept very much to herself&quot;.

While still in high school, White decided not to go to college and instead pursue a career as a chef. She worked at Memphis Smoke, a restaurant in downtown Royal Oak, where she met budding musician Jack Gillis, a fellow high school senior from a Detroit neighborhood known as Mexicantown. They formed a relationship and frequented the coffee shops, local music venues, and record stores of the area.

== Career ==

=== The White Stripes ===

==== Formation and beginnings ====
On Bastille Day in 1997, White began learning to play the drums after attempting to do so on Jack Gillis&#x27;s drumkit. Gillis said that &quot;When she started to play drums with me, just on a lark, it felt liberating and refreshing. There was something in it that opened me up.&quot; The two then formed the White Stripes, where they stuck to certain motifs: Gillis and White presented themselves as siblings to an unknowing public, and kept to a chromatic theme, dressing only in red, white, and black. They played their first gig at the Gold Dollar in Detroit, and achieved popularity in Michigan&#x27;s underground garage rock scene, opening for and playing with established local bands such as Bantam Rooster and the Dirtbombs, among others. In 1998, they were approached by Dave Buick, the owner of Detroit-based independent record label Italy Records, who offered to pay for their debut single. &quot;Let&#x27;s Shake Hands&quot; was then released in February 1998. 

In 1999, the band signed with the California-based label Sympathy for the Record Industry, and released their self-titled debut album. AllMusic said that White&#x27;s drumming &quot;balances out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming cymbal, bass drum, and snare...&quot; Following their divorce in 2000, White insisted that they keep the band going. Their second album, &quot;De Stijl&quot;, was released in 2001. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jenny Eliscu said that White&#x27;s drumming &quot;forces a smile because, like everything about the White Stripes, it proves that you don&#x27;t need bombast to make a blues explosion.&quot; It became a sleeper hit in 2002 after the White Stripes gained popularity, reaching 38 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Independent Albums chart in 2002.
==== Mainstream recognition ====
The White Stripes rose to widespread recognition in 2001 with the release of their album &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;. She shared vocal duties with Jack on the tracks &quot;Hotel Yorba&quot; and &quot;This Protector&quot;, and also on the Loretta Lynn cover &quot;Rated X&quot; which features as the B-side to &quot;Hotel Yorba&quot;. &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; would have a major label re-release with V2 Records in 2002, which brought them to the forefront of the garage rock revival and made them one of the most acclaimed bands of the year. It was their last album to be released with the Sympathy for the Record Industry. Chris Deville of &quot;Stereogum&quot; praised White for bashing &quot;the bejesus out of her drums&quot; and called the pair &quot;too compelling for the rest of the world to ignore.&quot; The album included the groundbreaking single &quot;Fell in Love with a Girl&quot;, which won them three awards at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards.

The White Stripes released their fourth studio album, &quot;Elephant&quot;, through V2 Records and XL Recordings in 2003. The album was acclaimed, and is often considered the band&#x27;s best work. Their continued success helped establish Meg and Jack White as key figures of 2000s rock, and &quot;Elephant&quot;, along with &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, were included on numerous editions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list. AllMusic writers described White&#x27;s drumming on &quot;Elephant&quot; as &quot;hypnotic&quot; and &quot;explosively minimal&quot;, and Bram Teltelman of &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;simple but effective&quot;. &quot;Elephant&quot;&#x27;s first single, &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, became the band&#x27;s signature song and a sports anthem. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot;, features what critics called some of Meg&#x27;s best drumming. Additionally, the track &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot; features White singing lead for the first time. Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot; described her voice as &quot;magnetic&quot;, and Andrew Katchen with &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that she sounded &quot;delicate and sweet&quot;. &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot; and &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; are considered two of the greatest songs made by the band. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; won the Grammy for Best Rock Song. 

In 2004, she starred in the band&#x27;s first music film &quot;Under Blackpool Lights&quot;, which was shot entirely on super 8 film. Jamie Russell of &quot;BBC&quot; described her as &quot;orgasmically pounding the drums&quot; and &quot;exhilarating&quot;. The band&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot; saw the pair experimenting, with White using percussion bells, maracas and tambourines. Critically acclaimed, it was released in 2005 and won the band their second Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album. She performed lead vocals on &quot;Passive Manipulation&quot;, for which Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described her vocals as &quot;chilling&quot; while Matthew Murphy of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; thought that the song &quot;begs the gentle suggestion that Meg not be allowed to sing lead.&quot;

==== Final years ====

The White Stripes released their sixth and final album, &quot;Icky Thump&quot;, in 2007. Winning the Grammys for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song, the album was praised and saw the band returning to styles present on their first album. White spoke on the bagpipe-heavy track &quot;St. Andrew (This Battle Is in the Air)&quot; and provided backing vocals for the tracks &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You&#x27;re Told)&quot; and &quot;Rag and Bone&quot;.

In the summer of 2007, before a show in Southaven, Mississippi, Ben Blackwell (Jack White&#x27;s nephew and the group&#x27;s archivist) says that Meg White approached him and said, &quot;This is the last White Stripes show&quot;. He asked if she meant of the tour, but she responded, &quot;No. I think this is the last show, period.&quot; On September 11, 2007, the White Stripes announced via their website that they were canceling 18 tour dates due to White&#x27;s acute anxiety. The following day, the duo canceled the remainder of their 2007 UK tour dates as well. Jack White worked with other artists in the meantime, but Meg White remained largely out of the public eye, though in June 2008 she appeared briefly onstage during an encore set of a Detroit show with one of Jack&#x27;s bands, the Raconteurs. In an interview with &quot;Music Radar&quot;, Jack explained that Meg&#x27;s acute anxiety had been due to the combination of a very short pre-tour rehearsal time—that was further reduced by the birth of his son—and a hectic, multi-continental touring schedule. He said, &quot;I just came from a Raconteurs tour and went right into that, so I was already full-speed. Meg had come from a dead-halt for a year and went right back into that madness.&quot;
Jack revealed the band&#x27;s plan to release a seventh album by the summer of 2009. On February 20, 2009—and on the final episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;—the band made their first, and what would be their last, live appearance after the cancellation of their tours, performing the song &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Be Friends&quot;. A documentary about their Canadian tour—titled &quot;The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights&quot;—premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. Directed by Emmett Malloy, the film documents the band&#x27;s summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Bill Bradley for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; opined that it was &quot;impossible&quot; not to see Meg as &quot;road-weary and worn-out&quot; at the end of the film.

A second feature titled &quot;Under Nova Scotian Lights&quot; was prepared for the DVD release. On February 2, 2011, the band reported on their official website that they were disbanding. Their statement said it was not due to health issues or artistic differences, but &quot;mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band&quot;. White has not been active in the industry since.

=== Solo ventures ===
White appears on the cover of Whirlwind Heat&#x27;s single &quot;Pink&quot; wearing a bunny costume; the photo was taken while the White Stripes and Whirlwind Heat toured together in Japan. She made her film debut appearing with Jack White in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot;. They star in the segment &quot;Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil&quot;, which expands on White Stripes motifs such as childhood innocence and Nikola Tesla.

In 2004, White starred as Little Red Riding Hood in the music video for &quot;Cha Cha Twist&quot; by the Detroit Cobras. White modeled for Marc Jacobs&#x27; 2006 Spring line. Two of her pictures appeared in the March 2006 issue of &quot;ELLE&quot;. She was chosen by Bob Odenkirk to compose a drum theme for Dax Shepard&#x27;s character in the 2006 film &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Prison&quot;; against Odenkirk&#x27;s wishes however, the studio removed it from the film.

The White Stripes guest starred on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Jazzy and the Pussycats&quot;, which first aired on September 17, 2006. White had previously expressed interest in a &quot;Simpsons&quot; role, saying that &quot;A guest appearance would be amazing. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in a Lisa episode. They&#x27;re kind of boring. Maybe a Homer one would be better.&quot; White appeared with Jack in the 2009 documentary &quot;It Might Get Loud&quot;.

==Artistry==

=== Equipment ===
Throughout her tenure with the White Stripes, White extensively used the Ludwig Classic Maple kit with Paiste cymbals. From their early years to &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot;, the resonant heads of the toms and bass drum almost exclusively featured peppermint swirls. The idea to do so came from Jack, when he and Meg &quot;walked into a drugstore and saw this bag of peppermint candy and I said &#x27;That should be painted on your bass drum because you&#x27;ve been drumming like a little kid&quot;. The peppermint decor became signature in her kit, and appeared in several live shows and music videos such as &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; and &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;. She donated her last Ludwig kit to the 2009 Jim Shaw Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Benefit, an auction to raise money for the Detroit musician who was suffering from cancer.

While recording &quot;From the Basement: The White Stripes&quot;, the design on the bass drum was switched to an image of her hand holding the apple from the &quot;Get Behind Me Satan&quot; cover. Beginning in 2006, White used a pair of Paiste 14&quot; Signature Medium Hi-Hats, a 19&quot; Signature Power Crash, and a 22&quot; 2002 Ride. On the &quot;Icky Thump&quot; tour, the bass drum head design was switched to a button inspired by the Pearlies clothing Jack and Meg wore for the album cover. She also used Remo and Ludwig drumheads, various percussion instruments and Vater drumsticks.

White&#x27;s Pearl Export bass drum—complete with original peppermint-painted bass drum that she used with the band&#x27;s first show—and the Pearly Queen outfit she wore in the photos for the &quot;Icky Thump&quot; album, were featured in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &quot;Women Who Rock&quot; exhibition.

=== Influences and musical style ===
White&#x27;s musical influences are wide and varied. Bob Dylan is her favorite artist and primary inspiration, and she is also a fan of Loretta Lynn. She has said of her influences: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to know about my biggest idols. I don&#x27;t want to read their autobiographies, I don&#x27;t want to find out what they&#x27;re really like.&quot; Her pre-show warm up included &quot;whiskey and Red Bull.&quot;

In reference to her &quot;primal&quot; approach to drumming, White remarked, &quot;That is my strength. A lot of drummers would feel weird about being that simplistic&quot;. She expanded by saying that &quot;I appreciate other kinds of drummers who play differently, but it&#x27;s not my style or what works for this band. I get [criticism] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I realize that this is what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible&quot;. On her style, Jack said &quot;Meg is the best part of this band. It never would have worked with anybody else, because it would have been too complicated... It was my doorway to playing the blues.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; Kelefa Sanneh said her &quot;drumming is more sophisticated than many fans (and many more non-fans) realize. She refuses to imitate a metronome, refuses to flatten the songs by making them conform to a steady pulse. Instead she seems to hear the music the way Mr. White does: as a series of phrases, each with its own shape and tempo.&quot;

== Public image and impact ==

=== Contemporary reviews ===
White&#x27;s minimalistic and simplistic drumming style divided audiences and critics of the time. Following the White Stripes&#x27; breakthrough, her drumming attracted attention. Writers of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in 2001 said that &quot;Meg White&#x27;s kit is bashed with such force you&#x27;d imagine her as some kind of incredible hulk, though in photos, she appears the prototypical indie girl-- waifish, with pigtails and a nasty smirk. Yet she whips all of her 98 pounds into a tornadic fury like E. Honda&#x27;s hundred-hand slap.&quot; After the White Stripes&#x27; breakthrough in 2001, UK newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; said that White &quot;reduced the art of drumming to its primary components, bashing the snare and cymbal together on alternating beats with the bass drum in a way that recalled Moe Tucker of the Velvet Underground.&quot; In a 2002 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; article analyzing the band&#x27;s style, writer Richard Harrington described White&#x27;s drumming as &quot;a surprisingly full sound, loud and raucous -- like the Carpenters on steroids&quot;. Of a 2002 concert in Cleveland, Ohio, Chuck Klosterman said, &quot;[Meg] never grimaced and didn&#x27;t appear to sweat; yet somehow her drums sounded like a herd of Clydesdales falling out of the sky, one after another. Clearly this is a band at the apex of its power&quot;.

There was criticism of White&#x27;s performances and technique. In 2003, Associated Press called White&#x27;s playing &quot;maddeningly rudimentary&quot;. The satirical news site &quot;The Onion&quot; featured the 2007 headline &quot;Meg White Drum Solo Maintains Steady Beat For 23 Minutes&quot;. In a review of their 2007 Madison Square Garden performance, a writer for &quot;Vulture&quot; said of her singing: &quot;Oh, God, it was awful ... Meg, great as she looks onstage, is pure amateur hour&quot;. Tyler Golsen of &quot;Far Out&quot; simplified the debate of the time: &quot;There is a strong misconception about Meg White&#x27;s drumming: because it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s not very good. For some reason, it&#x27;s OK when drummers like Charlie Watts and Ringo Starr purposefully play songs without flash, but when White does it, she gets criticised and commented on for her lack of ability.&quot;

=== Retrospective analysis and legacy ===

White is considered a key figure in the garage rock revival of the 2000s, and has since been praised for her &quot;primal&quot; style. She is one of the most discussed drummers in rock music, and her style continues to be evaluated after her retirement. On the enduring discussion of White&#x27;s drumming, Chris Willman of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine observed that &quot;Years after she disappeared from the scene, either too shy or just too disinterested to continue a rock ‘n’ roll career, she seems to have been absorbed into rock orthodoxy as a great drummer by near-acclamation, and ironically stands as more of an icon than she ever did in her active years — although naysayers obviously persist.&quot; Negative reviews both at the time and in the present have been called &quot;sexist&quot; by Jack, who states that Meg&#x27;s drumming is &quot;best part of this band&quot;, and called her a &quot;strong female presence in rock and roll&quot;. 

Several musicians have praised White. Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and previously Nirvana stated in an interview that White is &quot;one of my favorite fucking drummers of all time. Like, nobody fucking plays the drums like that.&quot; Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine wrote in an Instagram post that White &quot;has style and swag and personality and oomph and taste and awesomeness that&#x27;s off the charts and a vibe that&#x27;s untouchable&quot;. Nandi Bushell cited White as one of her influences, and said that &quot;I saw Meg playing the drums and thought she was the coolest person in the world. I still do.&quot; She wrote on Twitter that the White Stripes &quot;moved me at 5 years old to want to play the drums and still move me today! My screams are for you Meg! You are and always will be my role model and hero!&quot; Tré Cool of Green Day called Meg White one of his favorite drummers. Musicians Tracey Thorn and Wanda Jackson have covered the song &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot; as tributes. 

In March 2023, &quot;National Review&quot; magazine published an article celebrating the 20 year anniversary of &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;. In response to a tweet concerning the article on Twitter, journalist Lachlan Markay wrote &quot;The tragedy of the White Stripes is how great they would&#x27;ve been with a half decent drummer. Yeah yeah I&#x27;ve heard all the &quot;but it&#x27;s a carefully crafted sound mannnn!&quot; takes. I&#x27;m sorry Meg White was terrible and no band is better for having shitty percussion.&quot; The tweet went viral, and Jack, along with several musicians and critics, came to her defense. Markay later apologized and deleted his comments. He wrote that &quot;It was an over-the-top take ... I don&#x27;t know if Meg White herself saw that tweet. I hope not, because I imagine it wouldn&#x27;t feel great to see a stranger dumping on you like that, so to Meg White: I am sorry. Really. And to women in the music business generally, who I think are disproportionately subject to this sort of shit, I am sorry to have fed that as well.&quot; As a result, White trended that month. White did not respond to the controversy.

Robin Murray of &quot;Clash&quot; titled her &quot;One of Rock&#x27;s Greatest Drummers&quot; in 2023. In a 2024 &quot;Euronews&quot; article, Jonny Walfisz likened White to Ringo Starr of the Beatles, calling her a &quot;sheer genius of a drummer&quot; who, like Starr, had a deceptively simple style which showed creativity through minimalism to best support each song. Erica Banas at WRAT called her &quot;Rock&#x27;s Favorite Recluse&quot; in 2024, quipping that &quot;No other drummer can rattle a rearview mirror quite like Meg White&quot;. Also in 2024, writers at &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; concluded her &quot;minimalistic style was the perfect counter to Jack&#x27;s shredding, a primal dynamic that gave their tunes that definitive garage stomp. [...] Meg provided the feel.&quot;

==Personal life==
White and Jack White dated in the mid-1990s, and were married on September 21, 1996, with Jack taking her last name. They divorced on March 24, 2000. In May 2009, she married guitarist Jackson Smith in a small ceremony in Jack White&#x27;s backyard in Nashville, Tennessee. Jackson is the son of musicians Patti Smith and Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith. They divorced in July 2013. White resides in Detroit as of 2016. She loves peppermint, and it inspired many of the White Stripes&#x27; artistic schemes.

White suffers from acute anxiety, and has described herself as &quot;very shy&quot;. She told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2005 that &quot;the more you talk, the fewer people listen&quot;. Her strict maintenance of her privacy and giving few interviews has been the subject of significant commentary. She said in 2006 that she &quot;never really cared about all the things that other people cared about, you know? Like, people recognizing me on the street never interested me. I&#x27;ve always been kind of suspicious of the world, anyway, so it&#x27;s pretty easy for me to live in my own little world.&quot; As of 2023, she has not made any public appearances since 2009.

During the 2016 United States presidential election, White made a joint statement with Jack criticizing Donald Trump after &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; appeared in his campaign without their consent. After the Trump campaign used the song again in the 2024 United States presidential election, she and Jack reunited to file a copyright infringement lawsuit in September 2024. The lawsuit was dropped in November 2024.

== Accolades and achievements ==

With the White Stripes, White sold over 5 million albums. She received several accolades with the band, which includes winning one Brit Award from six nominations and winning six Grammy Awards from eleven nominations; she has been twice nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023 and 2025.

<text>Walter Dwight Wilcox (1869–1949) was an early explorer of the Canadian Rockies, especially in the Lake Louise region.

==Life==

Wilcox was educated at Phillips Academy, Andover (Class of 1889) and Yale University (1893).

Walter Wilcox is known for his 1890s discovery and exploration of Paradise Valley, Desolation Valley and Prospector Valley near Lake Louise. He is accredited with the first ascents of Mount Temple (3,543m), on Aug. 17, 1894 with Samuel E. S. Allen and Lewis Frissell. Walter Wilcox made the first ascent on Mount Aberdeen (3,152m), Mount Niblock (2,976m), Mount Indefatigable (2,670m), and Cheops Mountain (2581m).

In 1898, Mount Wilcox (2,884m) in the Columbia Icefield area of Jasper National Park was named in Wilcox&#x27;s honour by J. Norman Collie. The pass that provides easy access to Mt. Wilcox was also named Wilcox Pass.

<text>Cessianus ( – 303) is a Roman Catholic saint and martyr. At the age of eight, he was martyred during the persecutions of the Roman emperor Diocletian in 303.

==History==
Pope Gregory XVI presented Bishop Mathias Loras with the remains of Cessianus in 1838. Loras brought the remains with him to the United States. The remains were placed within a side altar in the new St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral, in Dubuque, Iowa.

After the completion of renovations in the mid-1980s, it was decided to place the remains of Cessianus under the new, freestanding main altar. On November 23, 1986, the wooden box containing the remains of Cessianus was installed during Mass in the altar where they currently reside.

<doc id="649403" wikidata="Q1130842" url="?curid=649403" title="Union for Reform Judaism">
<text>The Union for Reform Judaism (URJ), formerly known as the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) until 2003, founded in 1873 by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, is the congregational arm of Reform Judaism in North America. The other two arms established by Rabbi Wise are the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and the Central Conference of American Rabbis. The current president of the URJ is Rabbi Rick Jacobs.

The URJ has an estimated constituency of some 880,000 registered adults in 819 congregations. It claims to represent 2.2 million, as over a third of adult American Jews, including many who are not synagogue members, state affinity with Reform, making it the largest Jewish denomination. The UAHC was a founding member of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, of which the URJ is the largest constituent by far.

==Belief and practice==

Reform Judaism, also known as Liberal or Progressive Judaism, embraces several basic tenets, including a belief in a theistic, personal God; continuous revelation, with the view that scripture was written by divinely inspired humans. The Reform movement upholds the autonomy of the individual to form their own Jewish beliefs, and to be the final arbiter of their own spiritual practices. At the same time, Reform Judaism stresses Jewish learning in order to gain insights into the tradition and make informed choices. The Reform movement also encourages its members to participate in synagogue and communal Jewish life. Reform Judaism draws a distinction between the moral and ethical imperatives of Judaism and traditional ritual requirements and practices, which, it believes may be altered or renewed to better fulfill Judaism&#x27;s higher function. Another central tenet of Reform Judaism is the belief that it is the universal mission of Jews to spread God&#x27;s message, to be a light unto the nations. Reform Judaism foresees a future Messianic Age of peace, but without the coming of an individual Messiah or the restoration of the Third Temple and sacrificial cult in Jerusalem. Reform Judaism rejects the notion of bodily resurrection of the dead at the end of days, while affirming, at most, immortality of the soul.

During its &quot;Classical&quot; era, roughly between the Civil War and the 1930s, American Reform rejected many ceremonial aspects of Judaism and the authority of traditional jurisprudence (&quot;halakhah&quot;), favoring a more rationalistic, universalist view of religious life. &quot;New Reform&quot;, from the 1937 Columbus Declaration of Principles and onwards, sought to reincorporate such elements and emphasize Jewish particularism, though still subject to personal autonomy. Concurrently, the denomination prioritized inclusiveness and diversification. This became especially pronounced after the adoption of &quot;Big Tent Judaism&quot; policy in the 1970s. Old ritual items became fashionable again, as were ceremonies, such as ablution. The liturgy, once abridged and containing much English, had more Hebrew and traditional formulae restored, though not due to theological concerns. In contrast with &quot;Classical&quot;, &quot;New Reform&quot; abandoned the drive to equate religious expression with one&#x27;s actual belief. Confirmation ceremonies in which the young were examined to prove knowledge in the faith, once ubiquitous, were mostly replaced by Bar and Bat Mitzvah, yet many adolescents still undergo Confirmation (often at Shavuot) between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. A unique aspect of Reform was its interpretation to the old rabbinic concept of &quot;Tikkun Olam&quot; (Repair of the World); it became a rallying cry for participation in various initiatives pursuing social justice and other progressive agendas, like the Civil Rights Movement, women&#x27;s equality and gay rights.

Another key aspect of American Reform, which it shares with sister movements in the WUPJ, is its approach to Jewish identity. Interfaith marriage, once a taboo – the CCAR penalized any involvement by its clergy in such ceremonies by ordinances passed in 1909, 1947 and 1962 – were becoming more prevalent toward the end of the 20th Century. In 1979, the URJ adopted a policy of embracing the intermarried and their spouses, in the hope the latter would convert. In 1983, in the United States, it recognized Judaism based on patrilineal descent, affirming that offspring of a single Jewish parent (whether father or mother) would be accepted as inheriting his status if they would demonstrate affinity to the faith. Children of a Jewish mother who will not commit to Judaism were not to be considered Jewish. These measures made Reform the most hospitable to non-Jewish family members among major American denominations: in 2006, 17% of synagogue-member households had a converted spouse, and 26% an unconverted one. These policies also raised great tensions with the more traditional movements. Orthodox and Conservatives rejected the validity of Reform conversions already before that, though among the latter, the greater proclivity of CCAR rabbis to perform the process under &quot;halachic&quot; standards allowed for many such to be approved. Patrilineal descent caused a growing percentage of Reform constituency to be regarded as non-Jewish by the two other denominations.

==Organizational structure==

The URJ incorporates 846 congregations in the United States and 27 in Canada. The Union consists of four administrative districts, West, East, South and Central, which in turn are divided into a total of 35 regional communities, comprising groups of local congregations; 34 are in the United States and one represents all those affiliated with the Canadian Council for Reform Judaism. The URJ is led by a board of trustees, consisting 253 lay members. This board is overseen by the 5,000-member General Assembly, which convenes biennially. It was first assembled in Cleveland on 14 July 1874, and the most recent biennial was held in Chicago on 11–15 December 2019. The board directs the Senior Leadership Team, headed by the URJ President. Spiritual guidance is provided by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which has some 2,300 clergy members who convene annually. Most CCAR members have been trained at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the Reform movement&#x27;s seminary. The CCAR has a publishing arm and oversees various committees, such as those focusing on Ritual, Responsa, and Prayerbooks. Synagogue prayers are conducted mainly by members of the CCAR and of the American Conference of Cantors. The political and legislative outreach of the URJ is performed by the Religious Action Center based in Washington D.C. The RAC advocates policy positions based upon religious values, and is associated with political progressivism, as part of the vision for &quot;Tikkun Olam&quot;. Tikkun Olam in Hebrew means “repairing the world.” The denomination is also supported by the Women of Reform Judaism (formerly, the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods).

The URJ has an estimated constituency of 850,000 in the United States, 760,000 Jews and further 90,000 non-converted gentile spouses. A greater number identifies with Reform Judaism without affiliating with a synagogue. The 2013 Pew survey assessed that 35% of Jews in the United States consider themselves Reform (the 2001 AJC poll cited 38%); based on these figures, Steven M. Cohen estimated there were 1,154,000 identifying non-member adults in addition to those registered, not including children. There are further 30,000 affiliated congregants in Canada. Citing those findings, the URJ claims to represent a total of 2.2 million individuals.

==Youth group and summer camps ==

NFTY exists to supplement and support Reform youth groups at the synagogue level. About 750 local youth groups affiliate themselves with the organization, comprising over 8,500 youth members.

The URJ Camp &amp; Israel Programs is the largest Jewish camping system in the world, comprising 14 summer camps across North America, including specialty camps in science &amp; technology, creative arts, and sports, and programs for youth with special needs. Many of the camps have long provided the opportunity for high school pupils to travel to Israel through the program Yallah! Israel during the summer. The Union offers various Israel programs for seminarians and students. Including a youth convention every other year.

==History==
===19th century===
Reform-like ideas in the United States were first expressed by the Reformed Society of Israelites, founded in Charleston, South Carolina, on 21 November 1824. It was led by Isaac Harby, Abraham Moise, and David Nunes Carvalho, who represented the younger, Americanized, and religiously lax generation in the Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim. Standing in opposition to a more stringent establishment, formed from English-born immigrants, Harby and his followers were mainly concerned with decorum. They demanded English-language sermons, synagogue affairs handled in English rather than Early Modern Spanish (as was prevalent among Western Sephardim), and so forth. However, they also arrived at more principled issues. On their first anniversary, Harby delivered an oratory in which he declared Rabbinic Judaism a demented faith, no longer relevant, and that America was &quot;the Promised Land of Scripture.&quot; They fully seceded by their second anniversary, after continued rebuffs on the part of the wardens, forming their own prayer group. The three leaders authored a prayerbook in which they completely excised any mention of the Messiah, restoration of sacrifices, and return to Zion. It was published in 1830. Far more moderate alterations along these lines, in the first liturgy considered Reformed, caused an uproar at Hamburg in 1818.

The Society, numbering several dozens, dissipated and merged back into Beth Elohim during 1833, but they did not cease being a factor. In 1836, the reunified congregation hired Gustavus Poznanski as cantor. He spent time in Hamburg and knew the rite of the Hamburg Temple. Traditional at first, Poznanski soon followed a different course. In 1843 he attempted to abolish the Second Day of Festivals and later published his own version of the Maimonides&#x27; Creed, which lacked reference to Resurrection of the Dead and the Messiah. He also instituted various ritual reforms. Supported by many of the former secessionists, he eventually resigned in 1847.

A year before that, Isaac Mayer Wise arrived from Europe. In a country where Jewish immigrants lacked an organized and established religious leadership, Wise quickly rose to prominence. While far from traditional belief, he was disinterested in offering a comprehensive new approach, focusing on pragmatic compromises. Wise introduced family pews for the first time in known synagogue history (by random, when his congregation bought a church) in Albany on Shabbat Shuvah, 3 October 1851. His attempts to forge a single American Judaism motivated him to seek agreement with the conservative Isaac Leeser. Relations between them, wrought with suspicion from the beginning, were terminated after Wise agreed to Leeser&#x27;s demands in the 1855 Cleveland Synod and then retracted when the latter left. Wise was soon outflanked by the radical Reform rabbi David Einhorn, who espoused a dogmatic, rigid line demanding conformity with the principles of Reform Judaism then formulated in Germany. Many other German rabbis crossed the ocean to the land where their religious outlook, free from state intervention or communal pressures, could be expressed purely.

Einhorn gradually gained the upper hand, though the conflict-laden synergy between him and Wise would lay the foundation of American Reform. The Philadelphia Conference of 3–6 November 1869 saw the radicals&#x27; victory, and the adoption of a platform which summarized the theory concocted in Germany in the previous decades. Priestly privileges were abolished, as the rebuilding of the Temple was no longer anticipated; belief in the Messiah and Resurrection was denied. Michael Meyer regarded the document as the denominational &quot;declaration of independence.&quot; The need for religious divorce (&quot;get&quot;) was also annulled, and civil divorce confirmed as sufficient, one of the first steps towards abandonment of most ritual traditions. While American Jews, even the nominally Orthodox, were scarcely observant, Reform began to officially dispose of practices still upheld. Its doctrine was well received by the immigrants and especially their assimilated children. Of 200 synagogues in the United States in 1860, there were a handful of Reform ones. Twenty years later, almost all of the existing 275 were part of the movement. On 8 July 1873, representatives from 34 congregations met in Melodeon Hall, Cincinnati, Ohio, and formed the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) under Wise&#x27;s auspices. The name reflected his hope to unite all Jews under a single roof. In 1875, Wise also founded Hebrew Union College. Yet his attempts to maintain a moderate façade failed. In a famous incident, on 11 July 1883, during the banquet celebrating the first graduation from HUC, non-kosher food such as shrimps and crabs was served. The so-called &quot;trefa banquet&quot;, while apparently the decision of the Jewish caterer and not of Wise himself (who observed dietary laws), prompted protests from the few American traditionalists, like Sabato Morais, who remained outside the UAHC. Several conservative members later claimed to have exited the room with repulsion, though little is factually known about the incident.

It was the arrival of Rabbi Alexander Kohut in 1885 which forced an unambiguous stance. Kohut, a follower of Zecharias Frankel and his Positive-Historical School, attacked the UAHC for abandoning traditional Judaism. A series of heated exchanges between him and Reform&#x27;s chief ideologue, Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, encouraged the latter to convene an assembly which accepted the Pittsburgh Platform on 19 November. Embodying the spirit of &quot;Classical Reform&quot;, it added virtually nothing to the theoretical foundation of the movement but elucidated it clearly. It was declared that &quot;to-day we accept as binding only the moral laws, and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives.&quot; A small group of conservatives withdrew from the UAHC in protest, joining Kohut, Morais, and their supporters in founding the Jewish Theological Seminary. At first unifying almost all non-Reform currents, it developed into the center of Conservative Judaism. In 1889, Wise founded the Central Conference of American Rabbis.

===20th century===
&quot;Classical Reform&quot; soon faced a more pressing challenge. The massive immigration from Eastern Europe, bringing over two million Jews who had strong traditional sentiments in matters of religion even when personally lax, dwarfed the UAHC constituency within a generation. In the 1910s and 1920s, the CCAR rabbis gradually reintroduced many elements once discarded in an effort to appeal to the newcomers. The influx, and the growth of interwar antisemitism, also brought a renewed stress on Jewish particularism and peoplehood, ritual, and tradition.

In contrast with the coolness toward Zionism expressed by Classicists – emanating both from their rejection of old Messianic belief, involving a restoration of the sacrificial cult in Jerusalem, and commitment to emancipation – many new clergymen, like Abba Hillel Silver and Stephen Wise, were enthusiastic and influential Zionists. These tendencies were codified in the 1937 Columbus Declaration of Principles, influenced by rabbis Samuel S. Cohon, Solomon Freehof and others from Eastern Europe. Anti-Zionist Reform rabbis broke away during WWII to found the American Council for Judaism, which declined in activity following the Six-Day War.

In 1950, HUC merged with the Jewish Institute of Religion, a Reform rabbinical college founded in 1922 by Rabbi Stephen Wise. The selective &quot;return to tradition&quot; encouraged many Americanized Eastern-European-descended Jews to flock to Reform congregations in the postwar years, rapidly swelling the membership ranks of the UAHC. This factor, along with the URJ&#x27;s commitment to Outreach, diversity (&quot;big tent Judaism&quot;), and a welcoming attitude labeled &quot;Audacious Hospitality&quot; by URJ president, Rabbi Richard Jacobs, have all contributed to the Reform Movement&#x27;s emergence as the largest Jewish religious denomination in North America.

The HUC, as a member of the National Community Relations Advisory Council, opposed the Rosenberg Committee, believing them to be a Communist group. In 1953, the council issued a statement that the Rosenberg Committee&#x27;s accusation that the Rosenberg trial was motivated by antisemitism was causing public panic within the Jewish community.

In 1990, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and other major Jewish-American organizations asked that Nelson Mandela clarify his pro-Palestinian views prior to his visit to New York City. The UAHC&#x27;s senior vice president Albert Vorspan said that &quot;We are hoping to clear the air and defuse the situation so that Mandela&#x27;s visit...is what it ought to be: a great welcome for a liberation hero without a lot of marginal controversy.&quot; In a meeting in Geneva that included representatives from the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress, and other organizations, Mandela apologized for offending the Jewish-American establishment, expressed appreciation for South African Jews who opposed apartheid, praised certain Israeli leaders, and agreed that the State of Israel had a right to exist. 

====KESHER====
KESHER (from Hebrew &#x27;linkage&#x27;, &#x27;connection&#x27;) is the now-defunct college outreach arm and campus student organization for Reform Judaism. It was formally disbanded in 2009, though it continued to operate Taglit Birthright Israel trips, under the brand &quot;URJ Kesher&quot; for several more years. There are no longer any official college programs run by the URJ.

Its directors included Paul Reichenbach (–1995), David Terdiman (1995–1997), Rabbi Jonathan Klein (1997–2000), Rabbi Andrew Davids, Rabbi Marc Israel, Lisa David (–2006); Nicole Rand was the latest acting director. There had been two program associates and an Israeli &quot;shaliach&quot;.

KESHER worked with organizations like Hillel to create Reform Jewish programs on campuses across North America. They were a member of the Israel Campus Coalition and sponsored the Argentina Ambassadors trip. KESHER also hosted a Leadership Training Seminar during the spring semester, coordinated by members of the KESHER Student Leadership Council. This council was made of 6-7 junior and senior students who applied each year for one or two terms (a school year). Through its website, the group disseminated many documents describing the connection between Reform Judaism and North American Jewish youth.

<text>Vasily the Blessed (known also as Basil, and as the fool for Christ; the Wonderworker of Moscow; or Blessed Vasily of Moscow; , Vasily Blazhenny) is a Russian Orthodox saint of the type known as &quot;yurodivy&quot; or &quot;holy fool&quot;.

==Life==

Vasily was born to serfs in December 1468 at the portico of the Epiphany Cathedral at Yelokhovo (now in Moscow). His father was named Jacob and his mother Anna.

Originally an apprentice shoemaker, he went to Moscow when he was sixteen. There he helped those who were ashamed to ask for alms, but were in need of help. He adopted an eccentric lifestyle of shoplifting and giving to the poor to shame the miserly and help those in need. He went naked and weighed himself down with chains. He rebuked Ivan the Terrible for not paying attention in church. Vasily was said to have the gift of prophecy.

When he died on August 2, 1552, or 1557, St. Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow, served his funeral with many clergy. He is buried in St. Basil&#x27;s Cathedral in Moscow, which was commissioned by Ivan for commemoration of his conquest of Kazan&#x27; and was named for the saint later. Vasily was formally canonised in 1588. His feast day is celebrated on August 2 (August 15, N.S.).

<text>Apopudobalia (; + + + ) is a fictional sport that was the subject of a famous fictitious entry in &quot;Der neue Pauly Enzyklopaedie der Antike&quot;, edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, ), which gives a description of an ancient Greco-Roman sport that anticipates modern soccer. The article goes on to cite suitably sparse documentation for the nonexistent sport (this includes a &quot;Festschrift&quot; to one M. Sammer), and to assert that a Roman form of the game enjoyed a certain popularity amongst the Roman legions, and consequently spread throughout the Empire as far afield as Britain, &quot;where the game enjoyed a revival in the 19th century.&quot; It also notes that the game was frowned upon by some early Christian writers, such as Tertullian.

In reality, the ancient Romans did play a game resembling rugby called &quot;harpastum&quot;.

<text>In computer science, interactive computation is a mathematical model for computation that involves input/output communication with the external world &quot;during&quot; computation. 

==Uses==

Among the currently studied mathematical models of computation that attempt to capture interaction are Giorgi Japaridze&#x27;s hard- and easy-play machines elaborated within the framework of computability logic, Dina Q. Goldin&#x27;s Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs), and Yuri Gurevich&#x27;s abstract state machines. Peter Wegner has additionally done a great deal of work on this area of computer science .

<text>The Great Man-Made River (GMMR, , ) is a network of pipes that supplies fresh water obtained from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System fossil aquifer across Libya. It is the world&#x27;s largest irrigation project. The project utilizes a pipeline system that pumps water from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System from southern Libya to cities in the populous Libyan northern Mediterranean coast including Tripoli and Benghazi. The water covers a distance of up to 1,600 kilometers and provides 70% of all freshwater used in Libya.

According to the project&#x27;s website, it is the largest underground network of pipes () and aqueducts in the world. It consists of more than 1,300 wells, most more than 500 m deep, and supplies 6,500,000 m3 of fresh water per day to the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte and elsewhere in Libya. The late Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi described it as the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;.

== History ==

In 1953, efforts to find oil in southern Libya led to the discovery of large quantities of potable fossil water underground. The Great Man-Made River Project (GMRP) was conceived in the late 1960s and work on the project began in 1984. The project&#x27;s construction was divided into five phases. The first phase required 85 million m³ of excavation and was inaugurated on 28 August 1991. The second phase (dubbed &quot;First water to Tripoli&quot;) was inaugurated on 1 September 1996.

The project is owned by the Great Man-Made River Project Authority and was funded by the Gaddafi government. The primary contractor for the first phases was Dong Ah Consortium (a South Korean company) and the present main contractor is Al Nahr Company Ltd.

Imported goods which were destined for use in the construction of the GMR were made in Korea and Europe (mainly in Italy) and arrived by sea via the entry port of Brega (Gulf of Sidra). Cathodic corrosion protection on the pipeline was supplied by an Australian company, AMAC Corrosion Protection, based in Melbourne and delivered via the port of Benghazi. The rest of the material was made in Libya.

The total cost of the GMRP was projected at more than US$25 billion. Libya has completed the work to date without the financial support of major countries or loans from world banks. Since 1990, UNESCO has provided training to engineers and technicians involved with the project.

The fossil aquifer from which this water is being supplied is the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System. It accumulated during the last ice age and is not currently being replenished. If 2007 rates of retrieval are not increased, the water could last a thousand years. Other estimates indicate that the aquifer could be depleted of water in as soon as 60 to 100 years. Analysts say that the costs of the $25 billion groundwater extraction system are 10% those of desalination.

In this project 1 billion euros were invested for the installation of 50,000 artificial palm trees for water condensation. This project was carried out by the Spanish engineer Antonio Ibáñez de Alba.

On 22 July 2011, during the First Libyan Civil War and the foreign military intervention, one of the two plants making pipes for the project, the Brega Plant, was hit by a NATO air strike. At a press conference on 26 July, NATO claimed that rockets had been fired from within the plant area, and that military materiel, including multiple rocket launchers, was stored there according to intelligence findings, presenting two photos of an BM-21 MRL as sole evidence for the destruction of the factory. The evidence for a potential UN resolutions breach has been insufficient.

During the Second Libyan Civil War from 2014 to 2020, the water infrastructure suffered neglect and occasional breakdowns. As of July 2019, 101 of 479 wells on the western pipeline system had been dismantled.

On 10 April 2020, a station controlling water flow to Tripoli and neighboring towns was seized by an unknown armed group. The flow of water was cut to over two million people as a result, and as such the attack was condemned by the United Nations on humanitarian grounds.

<text>The Dardanelles Army was formed in late 1915 and comprised the three army corps of the British Army operating at Gallipoli. It was created as a result of the reorganisation of headquarters when the second Mediterranean front opened at Salonika. Prior to this, all British (and Dominion) units in the Mediterranean came under GHQ of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. The Dardanelles Army was created to manage operations at Gallipoli while the Salonika Army managed operations at Salonika. Both armies came under the direction of the MEF, which was also responsible for the defence of Egypt.

The Dardanelles Army was short-lived as, by the time of its creation, offensive operations at Gallipoli had ceased and plans for the evacuation were being made. For most of its existence, the Army was commanded by Lieutenant General William Birdwood. It comprised the British VIII Corps and IX Corps as well as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps and the 1st Newfoundland Regiment.</text><links>

<doc id="649429" wikidata="Q5430838" url="?curid=649429" title="Fairview Mountain (Alberta)">
<text>Fairview Mountain (sometimes called Mount Fairview) is a mountain in Banff National Park situated along the southeastern shoreline of Lake Louise. The mountain was named in 1894 by Walter Wilcox, which reflects the view from the top. An alternate name for the peak is &quot;Goat Mountain&quot; although it is rarely referred to as such.

While imposing cliffs seen from Lake Louise may indicate a difficult climb, the mountain is easily ascended by experienced hikers via a trail around the backside on the southern slopes of the mountain.

==Geology==
Fairview Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Fairview is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

<doc id="649430" wikidata="Q5214525" url="?curid=649430" title="Dan Vandal">
<text>Daniel Vandal (born April 18, 1960) is a Canadian politician. He represented St. Boniface on the Winnipeg City Council from 1995 to 2004 and from 2006 to 2014, and ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Winnipeg in 2004, coming in second to Sam Katz. He briefly served as acting mayor of Winnipeg following Glen Murray&#x27;s resignation. On October 19, 2015, he was elected as the member of Parliament for Saint Boniface—Saint Vital in the House of Commons of Canada. He is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and served as the Federal Minister of Northern Affairs in Justin Trudeau&#x27;s cabinet. On October 26, 2021, he was also named Minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency and Minister responsible for the Prairies Economic Development Agency of Canada, positions he held until 2024.

==Early life and career==

Vandal was born on April 18, 1960 in Winnipeg, the youngest of eight children. His family identified as French Canadian during his youth, and he only became aware of his Métis heritage in later life.

Vandal dropped out of high school, and was a manual labourer for part of his teenage years. He started boxing at age 15, turned professional in 1978, and was the #1 ranked Canadian middleweight in 1983. The following year, he fought Alex Hilton for the Canadian title in front of 18,000 fans at the Montreal Forum. He later credited boxing for turning his life around, and has opposed efforts to ban the sport.

Vandal subsequently became a youth worker at Winnipeg&#x27;s Mamawiwichiitata Centre, and received a degree in Social Work from the University of Manitoba. He was vice-president of the Old St. Boniface Residents Association in the 1990s, and campaigned against the proposed construction of a stadium for Sam Katz&#x27;s Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball team in Whittier Park.

==City councillor==

;Thompson administration

Vandal was elected to the Winnipeg City Council in the 1995 municipal election, winning an upset victory over incumbent councillor Evelyne Reese in the St. Boniface Ward. He was associated with the left-leaning Winnipeg in the &#x27;90s (WIN) group, which also included councillors Glen Murray and Lillian Thomas. In 1996, Vandal and Murray served on an ad hoc social services committee that held a series of public hearings on federal and provincial welfare cuts. He later saved the Pointe Hebert neighbourhood in his ward from being turned into parkland, and was chosen to sit on the city&#x27;s newly formed property and development committee in November 1997.

Vandal was a frequent opponent of Mayor Susan Thompson during his first term, and voted against several of Thompson&#x27;s major initiatives. He opposed a 2% salary rollback for municipal employees in 1996, and later opposed the dissolution of the Winnipeg Housing Rehabilitation Corporation, which provided public housing. In 1997, he voted against a proposal to allow Sam Katz to build a new baseball stadium for the Goldeyes on a city-owned site at The Forks. Vandal&#x27;s position was that the project was not financially viable, and that Katz would later return to the city for more money. The initiative nonetheless passed, and CanWest Global Park opened in 1999.

In February 1997, Vandal introduced a motion to create a municipal aboriginal affairs committee that would address issues of crime prevention and health. He later represented Winnipeg on an aboriginal subcommittee of the Manitoba Round Table on Environment and Economy.

;Murray administration

The WIN organization was dissolved after the 1995 election. Vandal was re-elected in the 1998 municipal election as an independent with support from the Winnipeg Labour Council and the New Democratic Party, of which he was a member at the time. Glen Murray was elected Mayor of Winnipeg in this campaign, and appointed Vandal to his executive policy committee (i.e. the municipal cabinet) as chair of the protection and community services committee, which oversees Winnipeg&#x27;s police, fire and hospital services. Vandal also led a task force charged with improving francophone services in the city, and was one of three council representatives on the board of Winnipeg Enterprises Corp.

;;Chair of the Protection and Community Services Committee

Murray&#x27;s administration was often at odds with Gary Doer&#x27;s provincial government in early 2000 over Winnipeg&#x27;s ambulance services. Murray and Vandal argued that the city&#x27;s share of the cost, about $2.5 million per year, should be assumed by the province. Doer initially disagreed, and the issue was unresolved for several months. In July 2000, the city and the province announced a deal with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority to provide five new ambulances and thirty new paramedics, with a ceiling on municipal costs. Vandal said that he was very pleased with the outcome.

Vandal promoted a plan to turn over some police responsibilities to civilian control in 1999, both to reduce costs and to free up more officers for front-line duty. He later supported a plan to introduce photo radar to catch speeding drivers, and endorsed a 2000 report that called for three fire stations to be closed to provide increased funding for paramedic services. Vandal argued that overall fire services would not be affected, as a smaller number of stations could oversee the city. Later in the year, he announced $445,000 in new money to combat a growing problem of arson.

;;Chair of the Property and Development Committee

Murray shuffled the executive policy committee on October 30, 2000, and moved Vandal to the chairmanship of Winnipeg&#x27;s property and development committee. Soon after his appointment, he helped bring about the demolition of an abandoned Canada Packers site in his ward. The site had been regarded as an eyesore for many years, and was a frequent target for arsonists.

Vandal was chair of the property and development committee when Wal-Mart announced that it had found suitable land for a new establishment in north Winnipeg. This came two years after the company lost a political battle to construct a store in a separate area of the same neighbourhood. Vandal argued that this announcement validated council&#x27;s decision to reject the initial application, which he said would have cost the city an extra $20 million.

Vandal was again endorsed by the Winnipeg Labour Council for the 2002 municipal election. No challengers came forward, and Vandal was returned to council by acclamation. Glen Murray was elected to a second term as mayor, and Vandal was kept as chair of the property and development committee after the election. In 2003, he helped oversee the beginnings of a new subdivision in Waverley West.

;;Aboriginal issues

Vandal said that he wanted to make aboriginal issues the top priority of his third term in office, and was subsequently the primary author of a 15-point strategy to combat poverty among Winnipeg&#x27;s aboriginal community. The strategy was highlighted by a plan to create urban reserves, and to provide increased municipal support for aboriginal ventures. The final version of the Municipal Aboriginal Pathways strategy was officially unveiled in September 2003.

;;Other issues

Vandal believed that St. Boniface could be developed as a vibrant French Quarter for Winnipeg, and supported tax credits as a means of encouraging this outcome. He also supported a plan to increase the area&#x27;s population, arguing that this would bring about improvements in other fields.

Vandal was the only member of Murray&#x27;s cabinet to support a compromise with local anti-poverty groups to remove the most contentious aspects of an anti-panhandling by-law in 1999. He supported funding for downtown festivals as a means of boosting tourism, and helped approve $200,000 to this end in 2000. He was the first cabinet member to favour a total indoor smoking ban in public places, and supported Winnipeg&#x27;s landmark smoking ban in 2002.

In May 2002, Vandal represented the mayor and council for the raising of a gay pride flag at city hall. He said that he hoped the flag would encourage a spirit of tolerance.

There were rumours that Vandal would run as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in a federal by-election in St. Boniface in 2002, but he declined to pursue the option. He later took part in a major Winnipeg protest against the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

;;Deputy Mayor

Vandal was promoted to Deputy Mayor of Winnipeg in a November 2003 cabinet shuffle, while remaining chair of the property and development committee and receiving additional responsibility for implementing the city&#x27;s aboriginal strategy. Many pundits saw this as evidence that Murray was preparing Vandal to become his successor as mayor. In 2004, Vandal indicated his support for Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s plan to divert a portion of Canada&#x27;s Goods and Services Tax revenue to municipal infrastructure.

In late 2003, Vandal requested that hockey legend and franchise owner Mario Lemieux consider bringing the Pittsburgh Penguins to Winnipeg. This was considered to be a longshot offer, and was not successful. Vandal later indicated that Winnipeg was contacted by a &quot;Sun Belt&quot; hockey franchise that was considering a move to Winnipeg, although this too never came to fruition. It was later revealed that the team in question was the Tampa Bay Lightning.

In late April 2004, Vandal was appointed to a steering committee on the development of Manitoba&#x27;s capital region.

==Mayoral campaign==

Glen Murray announced his resignation as mayor of Winnipeg on May 11, 2004, stepping down in mid-term to run for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. Vandal served as acting mayor until May 14, when he resigned his St. Boniface seat to officially seek election as Murray&#x27;s successor. He appointed Jae Eadie to the position of deputy mayor before resigning, which meant that Eadie served as acting mayor during the campaign.

Vandal ran on his record of accomplishment in Glen Murray&#x27;s administration, while indicating that he would run the city in a different style. He promised $4.4 million annually in new spending, a downtown housing tax credit and productivity reinvestment tax credit, doubling the city&#x27;s arts funding, and the creation of a new municipal holiday to celebrate the city&#x27;s heritage. His campaign launch was introduced by Tina Keeper, and his supporters included John Angus, Jenny Gerbasi, Lillian Thomas and Mary Richard, as well as the Winnipeg Labour Council and local anti-poverty activists. Despite a strong start, his campaign was hurt by the late entry of MaryAnn Mihychuk, whose candidacy split the centre-left vote. Some argued that Vandal also had difficulty presenting himself as a strong leader. He ultimately finished second against Sam Katz.

Shortly after the election, Vandal was hired by the province to administer a $75 million urban development agreement for Winnipeg&#x27;s inner city. He later became a project officer with the aboriginal affairs committee of the provincial cabinet.

==Return to city council==

Vandal was re-elected to the Winnipeg City Council for St. Boniface in the 2006 municipal election over incumbent Franco Magnifico, who had taken the seat after Vandal stepped down in 2004. The contest was expected to be close, but Vandal won by a significant margin. By this time, he once again identified as a member of the New Democratic Party. Sam Katz was re-elected as mayor.

Vandal was appointed to the Winnipeg Housing Steering Committee in March 2007, and also sits on the property and planning committee. In early 2007, he wrote an opinion piece for the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; calling for a reduction in property taxes rather than the business tax cut favoured by Katz. He argued that a business tax cut would drive up property rates, citing precedents in several other North American cities. Vandal has also criticized Katz and council for not moving forward with educational and employment opportunities for aboriginal youth, despite having allocated funds for such programs.

Vandal emerged as one of Sam Katz&#x27;s most prominent council opponents in late 2007 and 2008. He was a vocal critic of Katz&#x27;s water and sewer rate increases in late 2007, and accused the mayor of diverting the increased funds into general revenue to pay for his business tax cuts. (Following criticism, Katz agreed to stop the funding diversion by 2009. Some political observers described this as the first serious setback to Katz&#x27;s control over council after the 2006 election.) Vandal later opposed Katz&#x27;s plan for a private-public partnership to repair Winnipeg&#x27;s Disraeli Bridge and Freeway.

Vandal called for a public inquiry into the finances Riverside Park Management in late 2008, after the city erased $233,000 from the organization&#x27;s back taxes. The Riverside group is closely linked to Katz&#x27;s baseball team, and Vandal and others have raised concerns about a potential conflict-of-interest situation and Riverside&#x27;s status as a non-profit organization.

In late 2007, Vandal helped create a new city park named after Elzéar Goulet, who was a member of Louis Riel&#x27;s provisional government in 1869-70. He later helped preserve a provincial historical site at Upper Fort Garry against opposition from Mayor Katz and developers.

As one of his last acts as councillor in September 2014, Vandal instigated a two part motion to address the plight of abducted vulnerable women nationwide, particularly Native women. The motion calls for: the city to support the growing nationwide body of advocates including party leaders and advocates and Winnipeg, and provincial governments demanding a Federal inquiry into the plight of abducted and murdered women. The motion also calls for greater support for the Winnipeg Police to protect and socially support the recovery of vulnerable women of Winnipeg. The motion was passed with a vote of 14–1 on September 24, 2014 and Winnipeg the first major municipality to join the body of advocates. Outgoing mayor Sam Katz amended the proposition to include $150K to support an aboriginal youth drop in center. Vandal believes that this position will help open a dialog and advocate for the reforms to enhance protection of vulnerable women by giving them a voice.

==Federal politics==

Vandal stated that he would not run for re-election in 2014 and would instead run as the federal Liberal candidate in Saint Boniface—Saint Vital in the next federal election. Within a day of the writ drop, Vandal was endorsed by the United Fire Fighters of Winnipeg president Alex Forrest.

Having represented most of the territory covered by the riding for the better part of two decades, Vandal was considered a strong candidate. His chances significantly increased when Conservative incumbent Shelly Glover announced she would not run for reelection. While Glover had held the riding for two terms, it was ancestrally a Liberal one. Vandal won easily as part of the Liberals&#x27; near-sweep of Winnipeg, and was reelected almost as easily in 2021.

He is the current Minister of Northern Affairs and Minister responsible for two Regional Development Agencies: the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor) and the Prairies Economic Development Agency of Canada (PrairiesCan).

<text>The Xyridaceae are a family of flowering plants. This family has been recognized by many taxonomists and is known as the yellow-eyed grass family.

The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system of 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Poales in the clade commelinids, in the monocots. This treatment in APG II represents a slight change from the APG system of 1998, which had recognized the family Abolbodaceae for some of the plants included here; that family was unplaced as to order, but was assigned to this same clade (although APG used the spelling &quot;commelinoids&quot;).

The family contains almost 400 species in five genera, but most of the species are found in the genus &quot;Xyris&quot; (see also &quot;Abolboda&quot;). The species are mostly tropical and subtropical.

The Cronquist system of 1981 also recognized such a family and placed it in the order Commelinales in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida in division Magnoliophyta.

The Wettstein system, last updated in 1935, placed the family in order Enantioblastae.

&quot;Xyris torta&quot;, twisted yellow-eyed grass, is on Minnesota&#x27;s endangered species list.

In 2021 it was discovered that &quot;Fusarium xyrophilum&quot; was able to hijack a South American species of yellow-eyed Xyris grass, creating fake flowers, fooling bees and other pollinating insects into visiting them, taking fungal spores to other plants.

<text>Neil Leifer (born December 28, 1942) is an American sports photographer and filmmaker known mainly for his work in the Time Inc. family of magazines.

== Early life and education ==
Neil Leifer grew up in a Jewish family on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. At the age of thirteen, Leifer was introduced to photography through the Henry Street Settlement House, which offered free classes to the poor children of the neighborhood. Leifer began taking sports pictures, since it combined the two things that he liked. Along with Leifer, the photography group at the Settlement House produced three other photographers: John Iacono, Manny Millan, and Stanley Kubrick.

When he wasn&#x27;t doing photography as a youth, Leifer had odd jobs, such as shining shoes and delivering sandwiches. Eventually, he saved enough money to buy his first camera.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
As a boy in New York City, Leifer would gain free admission to New York Giants games by pushing the wheelchairs of handicapped patrons into the stadium. Using his free ticket and a camera, he would then position himself on the field with the photographers. Leifer gained free admission to the December 28, 1958 NFL title game between the Giants and Baltimore Colts. This game became famous as the first overtime game in league history, and is often referred to as the &quot;Greatest Game Ever Played.&quot; Leifer, on his sixteenth birthday, caught several images of the game-winning touchdown which he sold to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s editors liked Leifer&#x27;s work and he quickly became a boy wonder at the magazine. He had his first cover shot in 1962 at age 19.

=== &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ===

Leifer was also known for taking risks. For the 1966 heavyweight title fight between Cleveland Williams and Muhammad Ali, he placed a camera in the rafters of the Houston Astrodome to get a shot of the canvas when the victor knocked out his competition. It has been said that it is the only photo Neil Leifer took himself that is hanging in his house, also he regards this as his favorite photograph from a 40-year professional career. His shot of Ali and a defeated Williams has been seen by millions and was voted the greatest sport photo ever by &quot;The Observer&quot;.

A year earlier, Leifer was one of the only two photographers with colour film in his camera when Ali knocked out Sonny Liston in Lewiston, Maine, and his image of the moment has become not just one of his most famous photos, but one of the most memorable sports photos of all time – seen by many as the greatest sports photograph in history.

Another demanding technique, Leifer frequently used strip photography in the 1970s for athletes including Gaylord Perry and Billy Kidd, and for sports such as IndyCar racing.

=== &quot;Time&quot; Magazine ===

In 1978, Leifer left sports for a wider range of assignments with &quot;Time&quot; Magazine and produced 40 covers for the magazine. His cover subjects have included, President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George Bush, Alabama football coach Bear Bryant, National Rifle Association President Joe Foss, Statue of Liberty&#x27;s 100th birthday celebration, actors Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood, Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to America, Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson, New York City Mayor Ed Koch, The Space Shuttle Columbia, President Jimmy Carter, The Animals of Africa, Olympian Carl Lewis, and actor Paul Newman.

In 1992, Leifer covered both the Winter Olympic Games in Albertville, France and the Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. The 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia was the fifteenth Olympic Games he has covered.

In later years, Leifer gradually reduced his photography workload, turning his attention to films, although he has been known to come out of retirement for a special cover shoot for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; on rare occasions.

=== Filmmaker and documentarian ===
In recent years, Leifer has focused his creativity to the moving image. He is the director, producer and often writer, of noteworthy film including features, shorts, and documentaries.

In 2007, Leifer was shortlisted for the documentary film short Oscar for &quot;Portraits of a Lady&quot; which he directed, and co-produced with Walter Bernard.

== Books ==

<text>B32 Business Basic was a competitor to Data General Business Basic written by Murray Haszard in 1986. It ran on the Data General Eclipse MV line of computers initially, and was ported to Unix in 1989 and to DOS in 1991.

B32 Software was the company that developed and supported B32 Business Basic, with the original site in Auckland, New Zealand, supplemented by a sales and support centre in Blue Ash, Ohio.

The B32 interpreter was highly compatible with Data General Business Basic (DGBB), but it also enhanced and extended that language in many ways. Like DGBB, B32 could access Data General&#x27;s INFOS II database and it could use DGBB&#x27;s lock server or its own improved version. B32 was over twice as fast for number crunching, string manipulation, and disk I/O. Many of the internal restrictions of DGBB were removed. B32 allowed 32,767 line numbers (65,535 in later versions), compared with DGBB&#x27;s 9,999. B32 allowed more memory for programs, more simultaneous locks, and more files to be open at once. Language enhancements included a high-speed internal sort routine, do-while blocks, and the ability to step backwards through an indexed file. Debugging facilities were also significantly improved over DGBB.

B32 allowed programs to run with full cursor positioning and attribute support on non-Data General terminals, even programs which had Data General control sequences hard-coded into them.

B32 carried out all arithmetic at &quot;quad precision&quot;, i.e. 64-bit, and emulated the &quot;triple precision&quot; and &quot;double precision&quot; versions of DGBB at runtime. This avoided the subtle incompatibilities between the two versions of DGBB.

On Unix and DOS, B32 emulated all commonly used system calls of Data General&#x27;s AOS/VS and RDOS operating systems, including implementing its own symbolic links on SCO Xenix and DOS.

In 1991, a features war between B32 and one of its competitors, Transoft&#x27;s Universal Business Basic, saw major improvements to the B32 language. B32 added a Bluebird Business Basic emulation mode, made line numbers optional, and added subroutine calls by name with parameter passing.

Transoft had greater financial resources than B32, and more effective marketing. It purchased B32 in 1992. The DOS and Unix versions of B32 were discarded as Universal Business Basic ran on those operating systems, but the Eclipse MV version of B32 continued to be sold while the MV line lasted. Some of the B32 Software staff in Blue Ash moved to Transoft&#x27;s Atlanta, Georgia office. The New Zealand staff went on to found Binary Research.

Since that time, the city has purchased additional land, such as Cedar Grove in 1922, and of land south of Big Chico Creek in upper Bidwell Park in 1995. , the total park size is , nearly in length, making it the fifth largest municipal park in California, one of the largest city parks in the United States, and the 58th largest park in the world.

Bidwell Park is divided by Manzanita Avenue. The area west of Manzanita Avenue is referred to as Lower Park and the area to the east is referred to as Middle and Upper Park. Middle Park extends from Manzanita to a point roughly equal to the upstream edge of the Chico Municipal Golf Course. The Upper/Middle and Lower parks have differing terrain. Upper Park is located in the foothills of the southernmost Cascades. It has steep terrain and shallow soils, and contains many rock formations, including the unique Chico Formation sandstone, Lovejoy Basalt, and Tuscan Formation rocks. Lower Park is flat and level with a deep soil structure supporting a thick canopy of trees which provide ample shade for visitors. Special rules apply in the Upper Park and the road is unpaved for much of its length.

In July 2024, the Park Fire was begun by an act of alleged arson in the Upper Park, which burned a portion of the park near Alligator Hole.

==Points of interest==


*&quot;Sycamore Pool&quot;, located in the One Mile Recreation Area. The creek was dammed by the city in the 1920s; but the pool was cemented and finished out by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s, as part of several WPA improvements to Bidwell Park. There are tile depth markers every six feet or so along the pool’s edge. The lifeguard chairs look original, but that is uncertain. A bridge across the dam was built later using state Land &amp; Water Conservation Funds. The pool provides a unique swimming experience because its concrete decks, walls, and bottom are built to contain Big Chico Creek as it flows through the park. A dam and fish ladder at one end allow control of the creek&#x27;s flow. The dam is raised and lifeguards are present from Memorial Day to Labor Day of each year. Above the fish ladder there is a bridge that separates the pool and the creek, from which many locals feed sucker fish in the bottom of the fish ladder. Locals often refer to Sycamore Pool simply as &quot;One Mile&quot;.
*&quot;Caper Acres playground&quot; is also located in the One Mile Recreation Area. Originally constructed in the 1950s, the playground provides a fairy tale-themed location for children to play in. Many play attractions in the playground were destroyed by a storm in 1995, but were rebuilt by members of the community. Adult visitors to the playground must be accompanied by a child 13 years of age or younger.
*&quot;Cedar Grove&quot; is home to the 2nd tree experimentation farm in the U.S. Trees from around the world were planted in the grove by John Bidwell in 1888.
*&quot;Five Mile&quot;, located near Manzanita Avenue in the upper park area, is a manicured park and picnic area. A flood control dam makes the water deep enough for swimming in the spring and summer. During times of high water, part of the flow of Big Chico Creek is diverted into the Diversion Channel which flows into Lindo Channel, on the north side of town.
*The &quot;Hooker Oak&quot; was a large Valley Oak which grew along Manzanita Avenue north of Big Chico Creek near the &quot;Five Mile&quot; recreation area. Investigation of the &#x27;tree&#x27; upon its death revealed that it was actually two trees that had grown together.
*&quot;Horseshoe Lake&quot;, located in upper Bidwell Park, was constructed in the 1930s as a reservoir in which to irrigate the Bidwell Municipal Golf Course, located across Upper Park Road from the lake. The land around the lake was the site of several shooting ranges. One was used by the California National Guard and later, during World War II, the U.S. Army. A concrete bunker used for military target practice still remains next to the lake today. The other two ranges were used by civilians to shoot rifles and shotguns (skeet). All remnants of the shooting ranges (with exception of the military bunker) were removed in 2005 as part of a lead and skeet removal project. The lake is also the site of the annual &quot;Hooked on Fishing, Not on Drugs&quot; fishing derby for children.
*&quot;Monkey Face&quot; is a rock formation that was so named because it resembles a semi profile of a monkey head. It faces west over parking area E and Horseshoe Lake. The best place to start is from parking area E. As of Jan. 2013, major efforts are being made by the Park Dept. to mitigate erosion damage from multiple trails. Park users can respect the environment by using the trails designated.
*&quot;Alligator Hole&quot; is a shallow swimming hole in upper Bidwell Park near an area used by the Boy Scouts of America for campouts and other gatherings, between Horseshoe Lake and Bear Hole. Refrain from creating rock dams in the area, which are prevalent in the creek, but impede upon the movement of the salmon runs.
*&quot;Bear Hole&quot;, located in upper Bidwell Park beyond Horseshoe Lake, is a part of the creek that is frequently used for swimming and diving. The water is deep during the spring and summer and rocks on both sides are used for sunbathing. However, the currents in the area have a reputation for being dangerously unpredictable and have at times been fatal. In 1998 there were 4 drowning deaths within months. Bear Hole has a dirt and gravel parking area and a short trail.
*&quot;Diversion Dam&quot;, located just upstream from Bear Hole, is so named because it diverted some of the water from Big Chico Creek into a flume for use by the city. Remains of the flume can be seen along the banks of Big Chico Creek downstream of Bear Hole, and just upstream of Alligator Hole the flume track leaves the main creek channel and continues across the open area north of the creek.
*&quot;Salmon Hole&quot;, located in upper Bidwell Park beyond Bear Hole, is a part of the creek that is used for swimming. The site, which is essentially a large pond along the creek, is less accessible by car than Bear Hole and requires a short hike downward from the top of the rim. Visitors should come prepared to do some climbing. The salmon here have several hurdles to reach their native habitat. Refraining from building rock dams that span the creek is a good idea.

==Ecology==
Bidwell Park is home to a multitude of plant and animal species because it is at a point where Sierra Nevada, Cascade, and Central Valley species interact. The parks ecology also changes east-west as the park changes from flat valley to rugged foothills. The park&#x27;s climate is classified as Mediterranean because it has cool rainy winters and hot dry summers.

Animal species include mammals such as American black bear, little brown bat, cougars, beavers, coyotes and others. Prominent birds in the park are acorn woodpecker, red-tailed hawk, Western screech owl, turkey vulture, mallard, Canada goose, and northern flicker. Fish species include salmon (although their numbers have declined greatly), trout, bass and bluegill. Fishing is allowed in certain parts of the park. Reptile species of the area include Western pond turtle, Western toad, Southern alligator lizard, and the venomous Western rattlesnake. 

Plant life in the area changes as the park rises out of the valley, from riparian to chaparral and oak woodland. In the riparian along Big Chico Creek the main species include, Western Sycamore, the endemic to California valley oak, wild grape, blackberry, and Northern California black walnut. Oak woodlands are an especially important ecosystem in the park. Past the 5-Mile Recreation Area, the foothills of the southernmost Cascade Mountains begin and the flora changes. Gray pine or Foothill Pine become more frequent. In some parts along the creek ponderosa pine, incense cedar, and douglas-fir are present. California buckeye, manzanita, California bay laurel, miner&#x27;s lettuce, interior live oak, and seasonal non-native field grasses cover the canyon floor. On top the mesas on each side of the canyon and on the slopes of the canyon blue oak are present due to their deep taproots allowing survival in dry conditions.

==Geography &amp; geology==
The geography of Bidwell Park is relatively simple. Big Chico Creek enters the park from the east within Iron Canyon, a deep, thin channel characterized by large boulders of basalt, and tall, steep cliffs. Iron Canyon is situated in a larger canyon called Chico Canyon. Chico Canyon is a bowl-shaped canyon with flat mesas on each side. Downstream, the creek exits Iron Canyon and begins to widen at the floor of the relatively flat bottom of Chico Canyon. As the creek leaves the foothills it begins to meander on the floor of the Sacramento Valley. West of 5-Mile Recreation Area, the creek enters more urban parts of the park. The park begins to thin as it stretches into the heart of Chico. By its westernmost point, the park encompasses just the banks of the creek. The western boundary is at the Esplanade road.

The geology of the park varies as the park travels from the Central Valley floor, to the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. The geology of the park is mainly volcanic due to the Cascades being a volcanic range. Big Chico Creek exposes many layers of geologic history of Northern California.

The bedrock layer under the park, and much of California is called the Chico Formation. It consists of sandstone and fossils from an ancient sea that once covered the Central Valley and the ancestral Sierra Nevada Mountains during the Cretaceous Period. This formation is visible in Upper Park near the eastern boundary. It is also visible in many areas outside the park in the Sierra Nevada, Coastal Ranges and Cascade foothills. Above the Chico Formation lies the Lovejoy Basalt. Evident by its dark, smooth complexion, the Lovejoy Basalt makes up most of Iron Canyon in Upper Bidwell Park. Swimming holes such as Bear Hole and Salmon lie in the basalt. This rock erupted from an ancient volcano near present-day Susanville, CA about 15 million years ago, during the Miocene. The Lovejoy Basalt extends through much of Northern California, and is notable at Table Mountain near Oroville, CA, and Black Butte Lake, west of Orland, CA. Above the Lovejoy Basalt lies the Tuscan Formation, a complex of volcanic lahars and volcanic ash, separated by layers of river cobble. The Tuscan Formation was created in a series of volcanic mudflows from extinct volcanoes, Mt. Maidu and Mt. Yana, between 10 and 2 million years ago during the Miocene and Pleistocene. The formation dives beneath Chico and holds the city&#x27;s immense aquifer from which it derives its water. The Tuscan Formation is visible in all of Upper Park, and forms the steep canyon walls of Chico Canyon, and makes up the famous Monkey Face rock formation. Small caves can sometimes be found in this formation. Lower Bidwell Park sits atop a deep soil complex of alluvium deposited by Big Chico Creek. This allows for the thick canopy of trees and undergrowth seen in lower park.

==Chico Creek Nature Center==

Chico Creek Nature Center, the park&#x27;s official interpretive center, is managed by the Chico Area Recreational District (CARD), however, it was a private non-profit until 2018. It is dedicated to enhancing the public&#x27;s awareness of Bidwell Park and its wildlife. The center features non-releasable injured wildlife and donated animals in the Janeece Webb Living Animal Museum and the Alice Heckert Native Plant Garden. The Center opened a new facility in spring of 2010, including the installation of new natural history exhibits in Howard S. Tucker Hall and a hands-on science classroom, Kristie&#x27;s Nature Lab.

Programs offered include preschool-age workshops, nature-themed birthday parties, exploration-oriented day camps, and K-6 grade environmental education field trips, guided nature hikes, and nature education programs for all ages.

<text>The Whitechapel and Bow Railway was an underground railway in east London, United Kingdom, now entirely integrated into the London Underground system. It was a joint venture between the Metropolitan District Railway and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway.

==History==
===Joint owners===
From 1902 to 1950 it was owned and operated as a joint venture. Initially the arrangement was between the Metropolitan District Railway (commonly called the District Railway) and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. Both companies went through a series of amalgamations. The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway was purchased by the Midland Railway in 1912. It was subsequently grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 and was nationalised in 1948 as part of British Railways. The District Railway was part of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London and was absorbed into the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. This was nationalised as the London Transport Executive in 1948. Complete ownership of the Whitechapel and Bow Railway passed to the London Transport Executive in 1950.

===Construction===
The two mile long line opened in 1902 and linked the Metropolitan District Railway at Whitechapel (St Mary&#x27;s) with the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway at the above-ground Campbell Road Junction at Bow, to the west of Bromley station. The line from Whitechapel to Bow, and on to East Ham, was electrified in 1905. Regular services were provided by the District Railway with joint stock. A through Ealing Broadway to Southend service was also provided from 1910 to 1939, traction west of Barking being provided by District Railway&#x27;s electric locomotives. The LMS extended electrified track east from Barking and electric District Railway trains reached Upminster in 1932.

==List of stations==
*Whitechapel (current District line platforms)
*Stepney Green
*Mile End
*Bow Road

==Current operations==
Today the short line forms part of the District line and Hammersmith &amp; City line, between Whitechapel and Bow Road stations.

<doc id="649473" wikidata="Q7401808" url="?curid=649473" title="Saint Mary's Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)">
<text>Saint Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church is a former parish of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. The church is located in Dubuque, Iowa, United States, at the corner of 15th and White Streets. The church is recognizable by its steeple– one of the tallest in the area. The church property was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an historic district in 2015, and the various buildings were included as contributing properties in the Washington Residential Historic District later in the same year.

==History==

===The beginning===
During the 1840s, a number of German families moved to the city of Dubuque. Many of these families were Catholic. Initially, they attended Mass at St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral. However, the cathedral was becoming quite crowded due to the growing German and Irish populations of the city. Also, Bishop Mathias Loras was having difficulty ensuring that the German families were adequately cared for.

In 1849, Bishop Loras granted permission for 40 German families to form a new parish. Gerhard Hueckels donated land at the corner of 8th and White Streets in Dubuque. In 1850, a church was built on the land. This church, named Holy Trinity, was built of native stone with a tower about twenty feet tall.

For the first few years, there was a lack of priests in the still-young diocese. The people of Holy Trinity parish were served at first by a missionary, Father Gerhard Plathe. Finally, in 1853, they were given a resident priest, Father William Edmonds.

Soon the first major influx of German immigrants occurred. The small Holy Trinity church was filled to capacity. In 1863, the pastor, Father George Fendrick, and members of the parish founded the &quot;German Roman Catholic Association of Dubuque.&quot; Their goal was to build a new church to support the parish - which now had over 300 families. At first, they attempted to purchase the Presbyterian Seminary in Dubuque for $15,000. After other Christian denominations opposed this plan, the group instead purchased an orchard for $3,000. This site, about seven blocks north of the Holy Trinity Church, is the site of the current church.

===Construction of the new St. Mary&#x27;s Church===
In 1864, construction was begun on the new church. The plans were designed by the architect John Mullany, who had designed the present Cathedral building. Father Aloysius Meis directed the construction. The new building was done in Gothic Architecture style.
As with many other churches during the 19th century, most of the excavation and construction work was done by the men of the parish. By the time the foundation was complete in September 1864, only $3.03 was left in the treasury. The remaining $80,000 needed to finish the church was brought in through more fundraising and additional donations.

===From 1867 to 1922===
On February 10, 1867, Bishop John Hennessy dedicated the new St. Mary&#x27;s Church. Over the next 55 years, the population of Dubuque continued to grow. This was especially true in the 1880s with the arrival of the Milwaukee Railroad shops. St. Mary&#x27;s was the mother parish of four other area parishes. Sacred Heart was established in 1879, followed by Holy Ghost in 1896. In 1910, a new Holy Trinity Church was built near Eagle Point Park in Dubuque in memory of the first church in Dubuque to carry that name. Finally in 1922, Nativity parish was built near what today is called Loras College.

In the early 1870s, the Hook and Hastings Company - a prominent 19th century organ builder - installed an organ in the choir loft. This organ was placed in a visually impressive case. The organ was significantly altered by the Lima Pipe Organ Company of Elida, Ohio, in 1965; the case and most of the pipes were retained, augmented by all new mechanism (including windchests constructed of aluminum) and several additional ranks of pipes. It currently has three manuals and 33 stops.

The sanctuary was extended in 1911, followed by the construction of two small chapels at the rear of the church. In 1914, stained glass windows built in Bavaria were installed in the church, though the shipment of the windows was nearly stopped because of the outbreak of World War I. Twelve large stained glass windows honor the Blessed Virgin Mary, and a large mural of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was painted behind the altar, because the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the patron saint of the parish.

===From 1922 to the present===

In 1935, Father Aloysius Schmitt was ordained in Rome, Italy. He returned to the United States, and his first assignment was as an associate at Saint Mary&#x27;s Church. In 1941, he was killed in the attack at Pearl Harbor, becoming the first American chaplain of any faith to die in the Second World War.

In the early 1970s, the reforms of the Second Vatican Council were implemented. The parish removed the communion rail and placed a new altar in the sanctuary that faced the congregation. However, the original high and side altars were left largely intact.

In recent years, St. Mary&#x27;s Church had combined efforts with the nearby St. Patrick&#x27;s Church. The two parishes shared administrative staff and school facilities. The parish has been affected by the Priest shortage and a decline in membership as some families moved to suburban locations. The parish had a priest to lead Mass, but most of the administrative work was handled by a lay woman minister, the wife of a former U.S. Representative who is a deacon.

In the 1990s, St. Mary&#x27;s built a new handicapped entrance. This entrance is located at the northeast corner of the church and has an elevator. Before that, the church was not as accessible as other churches in the area.

With a heavy debt load and a declining membership, the parish council recommended to the Archdiocese that the parish be closed. In late 2009 it was announced that the parish would be closed. On May 25, 2010, St. Mary&#x27;s held its final mass as a Catholic parish with 700 attendees. The building is still considered a church, but the parish is no longer active.

The movie &quot;F.I.S.T.,&quot; which was largely filmed in Dubuque, had a scene which featured exterior shots of St. Mary&#x27;s Church.

A book entitled &quot;St. Marys: Finest church west of the Mississippi&quot; covering the complete history of the church was published in August 2010. In 2014 a conceptual plan (but no timeline or cost estimate) to renovate the campus to provide office space for small businesses, a community kitchen and 12 units of low income housing was jointly announced by the Dubuque Archdiocese, non-Catholic community groups such as Dubuque&#x27;s Economic Development Department and the Washington Neighborhood Corporation, and Dubuque-based Gronen Restoration.

==Schools==
St. Mary&#x27;s School merged with St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic School to form Downtown Catholic School in 1982. The organization Holy Family Catholic Schools took control of Downtown Catholic and other Dubuque-area Catholic schools in 2001. Downtown Catholic and Sacred Heart – Holy Trinity School became St. Francis School in 2002, and St. Francis closed in 2004. Four Oaks Family and Children Services bought the school building in 2006.

<text>Dev-C++ is a free full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) distributed under the GNU General Public License for programming in C and C++. It was originally developed by Colin Laplace and was first released in 1998. It is written in Delphi.

It is bundled with, and uses, the MinGW or TDM-GCC 64bit port of the GCC as its compiler. Dev-C++ can also be used in combination with Cygwin or any other GCC-based compiler.

== DevPaks ==
An additional aspect of Dev-C++ is its use of DevPaks: packaged extensions on the programming environment with additional libraries, templates, and utilities. DevPaks often contain, but are not limited to, GUI utilities, including popular toolkits such as GTK+, wxWidgets, and FLTK. Other DevPaks include libraries for more advanced function use. Users of Dev-C++ can download additional libraries, or packages of code that increase the scope and functionality of Dev-C++, such as graphics, compression, animation, sound support and many more. Users can create DevPaks and host them for free on the site. Also, they are not limited to use with Dev-C++ - the site says &quot;A typical devpak will work with any MinGW distribution (with any IDE for MinGW)&quot;.

== Development status ==

From February 22, 2005 the project was not noticeably active, with no news posted nor any updated versions released. In a 2006 forum post, lead developer Colin Laplace stated that he was busy with real-life issues and did not have time to continue the development of Dev-C++.

There are three forks of Dev-C++ since then: wxDev-C++, the &quot;Orwell&quot; version, and the Embarcadero-maintained fork version.

=== wxDev-C++ version ===
wxDev-C++ is a development team that has taken Dev-C++ and added new features such as support for multiple compilers and a RAD designer for wxWidgets applications.

=== Orwell version ===
On June 30, 2011 an unofficial version 4.9.9.3 of Dev-C++ was released by Orwell (Johan Mes), an independent programmer, featuring the more recent GCC 4.5.2 compiler, Windows&#x27; SDK resources (Win32 and D3D), numerous bugfixes, and improved stability. On August 27, after five years of officially being in the beta stage, version 5.0 was released. This version also has its own separate SourceForge page since version 5.0.0.5, because the old developer is not responding to combining requests. In July 2014, Orwell Dev-C++ 5.7.1 was released featuring the then-recent GCC 4.8.1 which supports C++11. In a 2020 forum post, Orwell lead developer Johan Mes stated that he &quot;will probably still not have any time to work on this project&quot;.

=== Embarcadero version ===
On July 1, 2020 a new fork version 5.50 of Dev-C++ was sponsored and released by Embarcadero featuring a code upgrade to Delphi 10.4. On October 12, 2020 a new fork version 6.0 of Dev-C++ was sponsored and released by Embarcadero with a more recent GCC 9.2.0 compiler with C++11 and partial C++20 support, new high DPI support, UTF8 file support, upgraded icons, dark theme, and additional changes.

== Notable uses ==
On May 4, 2015, the Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong posted his Sudoku solver program in C++ on Facebook. In his screenshot, he&#x27;s using Microsoft Windows and Dev-C++ as his IDE.

It is often recommended for beginners learning C or C++, and is available on Wine. It is compared with Turbo C++ or other IDEs.

<text>The label of second-generation programming language (2GL) is a generational way to categorize assembly languages. They belong to the low-level programming languages.

The term was coined to provide a distinction from higher level machine independent third-generation programming languages (3GLs) (such as COBOL, C, or JavaScript) and earlier first-generation programming languages (machine code)

==Second-generation programming language==

Second-generation programming languages have the following properties:
*Lines within a program correspond directly to processor commands, essentially acting as a mnemonic device overlaying a first generation programming language.
*The code can be read and written by a programmer. To run on a computer it must be converted into a machine readable form, a process called assembly.
*The language is specific to a particular processor family and environment.

Second-generation languages are sometimes used for parts of kernels or device drivers, and are sometimes used in video games, graphics programs, and other intensive programs.

In modern programs, second generation assembly languages are rarely used. Programming in second generation languages may yield speed benefits, but several disadvantages have led to its decline:

* Programming is expressed in terms of individual processor instructions, rather than higher level logic.
* Low-level memory and hardware details must be manually managed which is often bug-prone.
* Programs are machine-dependent, so different versions must be written for every target machine architecture.

The vast majority of programs are written in a third-generation programming language or a fourth-generation programming language. Assembly&#x27;s main advantage, speed, has degraded by the fact that well written C code can often be as fast or even faster than handwritten assembly.

Second generation languages are perhaps most significant in their place in computing history. For a long time, Second generation assembly languages were the only good option for development for many machines, such as the NES or the Commodore 64. Second generation languages represented a massive step away from the tradition of programmers conforming to the needs of a machine, and the first step towards the machine accommodating for the programmer, a phenomenon that would be repeated in all subsequent programming language generations.

<text>The film industry or motion picture industry comprises the technological and commercial institutions of filmmaking, i.e., film production companies, film studios, cinematography, animation, film production, screenwriting, pre-production, post-production, film festivals, distribution, and actors. Though the expense involved in making film almost immediately led film production to concentrate under the auspices of standing production companies, advances in affordable filmmaking equipment, as well as an expansion of opportunities to acquire investment capital from outside the film industry itself, have allowed independent film production to evolve.

In 2019, the global box office was worth . When including box office and home entertainment revenue, the global film industry was worth in 2018. Hollywood is the world&#x27;s oldest national film industry, and largest in terms of box-office gross revenue. Indian cinema is the largest national film industry in terms of the number of films produced, with 2,446 feature films produced annually .

== Modern film industry ==
The worldwide theatrical market had a box office of in 2019. The top three continents/regions by box-office gross were Asia-Pacific with , the U.S. and Canada with , and Europe, the Middle East and North Africa with . , the largest markets by box office were, in decreasing order, the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, and India. , the countries with the largest number of film productions were India, and the United States. In Europe, significant centers of movie production are France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

=== China ===

The cinema of China is one of three distinct historical threads of Chinese-language cinema together with the cinema of Hong Kong and the cinema of Taiwan. Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, &quot;Dingjun Mountain&quot;, was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on Shanghai in the first decades. China is the home of one of the largest film studios in the world, the Hengdian World Studios, and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. For the next decade, the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving entrepot and the largest city in the Far East. In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, &quot;The Difficult Couple&quot;, was filmed in Shanghai by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan.

As the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent films were joint ventures and projects with international backers but remained quite resolutely low-key and low-budget . Jia&#x27;s &quot;Platform&quot; (2000) was funded in part by Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s production house, while his &quot;Still Life&quot; was shot on HD video. &quot;Still Life&quot; was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. &quot;Still Life&quot;, which concerns provincial workers around the Three Gorges region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Promise&quot; (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2014, the gross box office in China was ¥29.6 billion (US$4.82 billion), with domestic films having a share of 55%. China has also become a major hub of business for Hollywood studios.

In 2018, China&#x27;s gross box office was US$8.9 Billion
In 2013, China&#x27;s gross box office was ¥21.8 billion (US$3.6 billion), the second-largest film market in the world by box office receipts It increased to $4.8 Billion in 2014 box office grosser in film industry. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 China overtook North America as world&#x27;s biggest box office, being the first country to achieve this status. China retained this status in 2021. However, in 2022, North America once again overtook China as the global box office&#x27;s biggest market.

=== United States ===

The cinema of the United States, often generally referred to as Hollywood, has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. The United States cinema (Hollywood) is the oldest film industry in the world and also the largest film industry in terms of revenue. Hollywood is the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry with established film study facilities such as the American Film Institute, LA Film School, and NYFA being established in the area. However, four of the six major film studios are owned by East Coast companies. The major film studios of Hollywood including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Studios, and Paramount Pictures are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies in the world, including movies such as &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), and &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009).

American film studios today collectively generate several hundred films every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world. And while Sony Pictures Entertainment is headquartered in Culver City, California, its parent company, the Sony Corporation, is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Most shooting now takes place in California, New York, Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. New Mexico, especially in the Albuquerque and Santa Fe areas, had been an increasingly popular state for filming; the television show &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; was set there, and movies such as &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; and &quot;Rust&quot; were shot there. Between 2009 and 2015, Hollywood consistently grossed $10 billion (or more) annually. Hollywood&#x27;s award ceremony, the Academy Awards, officially known as The Oscars, is held by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) every year and as of 2019, more than 3,000 Oscars have been awarded.
On 27 October 1911, Nestor Film Company established Hollywood&#x27;s first permanent film studio. The California weather allowed for year-round filming. In 1912, Universal Studios was formed, merging Nestor and several other motion picture companies, including Independent Moving Pictures (IMP).

=== India ===


India is the largest producer of films in the world and the second-oldest film industry in the world. The country is home to some of the most important cities in the global film industry: Mumbai (previously Bombay), Hyderabad and Chennai (Madras). In 2009, India produced a total of 2,961 films on celluloid; this figure includes 1,288 feature films. Besides being the largest producer of films in the world, India also has the largest number of admissions. Indian film industry is multi-lingual and the largest in the world in terms of ticket sales but 3rd-largest in terms of revenue, mainly due to having among the lowest ticket prices in the world. The industry is viewed mainly by a vast film-going Indian public. Indian film industry is also the dominant source of films and entertainment in its neighboring countries of South Asia. The three largest film industries in India are Hindi cinema, Telugu cinema and Tamil cinema. The Hindi film industry is mostly concentrated in Mumbai (Bombay), and it is commonly referred to as Bollywood, a portmanteau of Bombay and Hollywood. Telugu cinema is primarily concentrated in Hyderabad and is commonly referred to as Tollywood. The Tamil film industry i.e. Kollywood is mostly concentrated in Chennai.

Besides the mainstream commercial movies, India also offers a different approach to cinema: the parallel cinema. The parallel cinema movement originated in West Bengal around the 1950s. The movement was initially led by Bengali cinema. It later gained prominence in other film industries in India. Parallel cinema is a blanket term designated to a certain type of films that stray away from the conventions of popular mainstream cinema. Parallel cinema has assumed various forms throughout the years. Filmmakers associated with parallel cinema are Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak. Parallel films are characterized by their rejection of popular forms like the songs and fight sequences, their affinity for rural settings, their use of method actors, and toned-down color palettes. The best examples of parallel cinema are the most famous films of Ray – Pather Panchali (1955), Aparajito (1956), and The World of Apu (1959) – which formed The Apu Trilogy. Some other examples of such movies are &quot;Raincoat&quot;, &quot;Dhobi Ghat&quot;, &quot;Mithya&quot;. Indian films have garnered popularity not only in the domestic market but also in the international markets, with &quot;Dangal&quot; having an overseas gross revenue of $260 million, &quot;Secret Superstar&quot; and &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; making a gross revenue of $80.4 million, and &quot; and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion&quot; (a blockbuster duology from Telugu cinema) grossing over $370 million globally. In India, they have over 400 production houses with 32 corporate houses; also supporting the livelihood of more than 6 million people.

The other largest film industries are Malayalam cinema, Kannada cinema, Bengali cinema (cinema of West Bengal) and Marathi cinema, primarily located in Kochi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Mumbai, respectively. The remaining majority portion are spread across northern, eastern, western, and southern India (with Gujarati, Punjabi, Odia, Bhojpuri, Assamese Cinema). However, there are several smaller centers of Indian film industries in regional languages centered in the states where those languages are spoken. Indian cinema encloses several several artforms like Indian classical music, folk music of different regions throughout the country, Indian classical dance, folk dance, and much more. Bollywood, Kollywood and Tollywood forms the largest portion of the Indian film industry and is viewed all over the Indian Subcontinent, and is increasingly popular in Australia, UK, United States, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Africa, Gulf countries, European countries, East Asia and China. The largest film studio complex in the world is Ramoji Film City located at Hyderabad, India, which opened in 1996 and measures 674 ha (1,666 acres). Comprising 47 sound stages, it has permanent sets ranging from railway stations to temples.

By 1986, India&#x27;s annual film output had increased from 741 films produced annually to 833 films, making India the world&#x27;s largest film producer. , Bollywood represents 45% of Indian net box office revenue, while Tamil and Telugu cinemas together represent 36%, and the rest of the regional film industries constitute 21% of Indian cinema. By 2021, Telugu Cinema (Tollywood) has overtaken both Hindi cinema (Bollywood) and Tamil cinema (Kollywood), emerged as the largest film industry in India in terms of box-office. In 2023, Bollywood again emerged as the largest film industry in India.

===Russian Federation===

The cinema of Russia, popularly known as Mollywood, refers to the film industry in Russia, engaged in producing motion pictures in the Russian language. The popular term Mollywood is a portmanteau of &quot;Moscow&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;. It began in the Russian Empire, widely developed in the Soviet Union, and the years following its dissolution. The Russian film industry would remain internationally recognized. In the 21st century, Russian cinema has become known internationally with films such as &quot;Hardcore Henry&quot; (2015), &quot;Leviathan&quot; (2014), &quot;Night Watch&quot; (2004) and &quot;Brother&quot; (1997). The Moscow International Film Festival began in Moscow during 1935. The Nika Award is the main annual national film award in Russia.
The first films seen in the Russian Empire were brought in by the Lumière brothers, who exhibited films in Moscow and St. Petersburg in May 1896. That same month, Lumière cameraman Camille Cerf made the first film in Russia, recording the coronation of Nicholas II at the Kremlin. Aleksandr Drankov produced the first Russian narrative film &quot;Stenka Razin&quot; (1908), based on events told in a folk song and directed by Vladimir Romashkov. Among the notable Russian filmmakers of the era were Aleksandr Khanzhonkov and Ivan Mozzhukhin, who made &quot;Defence of Sevastopol&quot; in 1912. Yakov Protazanov made &quot;Departure of a Grand Old Man&quot; (1912), a biographical film about Lev Tolstoy.

Animation pioneer Ladislas Starevich made the first Russian animated film (and the first stop motion puppet film with a story) in 1910 – &quot;Lucanus Cervus&quot;. His other stop-motion shorts &quot;The Beautiful Leukanida&quot; (1912) and &quot;The Cameraman&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1912), produced for Aleksandr Khanzhonkov, are also among the first animated films. In the following years, Starevich made shorts based on fables such as &quot;The Grasshopper and the Ant&quot; (1913), as well as World War I propaganda films..

=== United Kingdom ===

The United Kingdom has had a significant film industry for over a century. While film production reached an all-time high in 1936, the &quot;golden age&quot; of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s, during which the directors David Lean, Michael Powell, (with Emeric Pressburger) and Carol Reed produced their most highly acclaimed work. Many British actors have achieved worldwide fame and critical success, such as Maggie Smith, Roger Moore, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, and Kate Winslet. Some of the films with the largest-ever box-office returns have been made in the United Kingdom, including the third- and fourth-highest-grossing film series (&quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;James Bond&quot;).

The first moving picture was shot in Leeds by Louis Le Prince in 1888, and the first moving pictures developed on celluloid film were made in Hyde Park, London, in 1889 by British inventor William Friese Greene, who patented the process in 1890.

Two of the top eight-highest-grossing films worldwide of all time have some British historical, cultural or creative dimensions: &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2005). Adding four more &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films and one more &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movie, plus the Tim Burton version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), and more than half of the top twenty most financially successful films had a substantial British dimension.

British influence can also be seen with the &#x27;English Cycle&#x27; of Disney animated films, which include &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951), &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961), &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967). Disney first became interested in live-action films as a means of using financial reserves which had built up in Britain, and could not be repatriated owing to exchange controls, by making two films from Scottish and English sources. These were &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952), which were both successes at the box office. The studio continued to draw on British source material for its animated films after Walt Disney died in 1967, with the cartoon feature films &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973), &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; and &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (both 1977), one of many Disney to draw on A. A. Milne&#x27;s characters.

In the 1970s and 1980s, British studios established a reputation for great special effects in films such as &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), and &quot;Batman&quot; (1989). Some of this reputation was founded on the core of talent brought together for the filming of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) who subsequently worked together on series and feature films for Gerry Anderson. The Bristol-based Aardman Animations is known for its stop-motion animation.

In late 1998, Channel 4 launched their free-to-air film channel Film4 – a channel specifically designed to show films. It broadcasts from 11:00 am BST and competes with pay television film network Sky Cinema.

The London-based visual effects company Framestore, with Tim Webber the visual effects supervisor, have worked on the films &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008) and &quot;Gravity&quot; (2013), with new techniques involved in &quot;Gravity&quot; taking three years to complete.

=== France ===
France is the birthplace of cinema and was responsible for many of its significant contributions to the art form and the film-making process itself. Several important cinematic movements, including the Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a particularly strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the French government.

French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, and Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé and Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke), and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, some French directors have had careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur, or Francis Veber in the United States.

Another element supporting this fact is that Paris has the highest density of cinemas in the world, measured by the number of movie theaters per inhabitant, and that in most &quot;downtown Paris&quot; movie theaters, foreign movies which would be secluded to &quot;art houses&quot; cinemas in other places are shown alongside &quot;mainstream&quot; works. Philippe Binant realized, on 2 February 2000, the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris. Paris also boasts the Cité du cinéma, a major studio north of the city, and Disney Studio, a theme park devoted to the cinema and the third theme park near the city behind Disneyland and Parc Asterix.

In 2015, France saw a record-breaking 300 feature-length films produced. US and UK films only represented 44.9% of total admissions in 2014. This is largely due to the commercial strength of domestic productions, which accounted for 44,5% of admissions in 2014 (35.5% in 2015; and 35.3% in 2016). In the mid-2000s, the French film industry was described as being &quot;closer to being entirely self-sufficient than any other country in Europe, recovering around 80–90% of their budget in revenues generated from the domestic market&quot;. In 2018, French films had an international box office of €237m with 40 million admissions (down 52% from 2017), with Italy being the top foreign market.

=== Japan ===
Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; as of 2010, it was the fourth largest by number of feature films produced. Movies have been produced in Japan since 1897, when the first foreign cameramen arrived.

In a &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; list of the best films produced in Asia, Japanese works made up eight of the top 12, with &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953) ranked number one. &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; also topped the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; directors&#x27; poll of The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, dethroning &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, while Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) was voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC&#x27;s 2018 poll of 209 critics in 43 countries. Japan has won the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film four times (&quot;Rashomon&quot;, &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, &quot;Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto&quot;, and &quot;Departures&quot;), more than any other Asian country..

===Iran===
The cinema of Iran (Persian: &quot;سینمای ایران&quot;) or cinema of Persia refers to the cinema and film industries in Iran which produce a variety of commercial films annually. Iranian art films have garnered international fame and now enjoy a global following.

Along with China, Iran has been lauded as one of the best exporters of cinema in the 1990s. Some critics now rank Iran as the world&#x27;s most important national cinema, artistically, with a significance that invites comparison to Italian neorealism and similar movements in past decades. German filmmaker Werner Herzog has praised Iranian cinema as one of the world&#x27;s most important artistic cinemas.
It is notable, that Iran has won 2 Academy Awards and has been nominated 3 times, which is ranked 11th in the world cinema, second in Asia after Japan, and first in the Middle East.

===Turkey===
The Turkish film market stands out in the pan-European landscape as the only market where national films regularly outperform US films. In 2013, it had 1.2 million number of admissions and 87 feature films were released. Between 2004 and 2014, the estimated 12.9 million admissions generated on non-national European markets only accounted for 7% of total admissions to Turkish films in Europe (including Turkey). This was the third lowest share among the 30 European markets for which such data are available and clearly illustrates the strong dependence of Turkish films on the domestic market, a feature which is shared by Polish and Russian films.

In 2014, &quot;Kış Uykusu&quot; (&quot;Winter&#x27;s Sleep&quot;) won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Film. In 2013, Turkey still ranked behind the Netherlands in terms of the box office with just over EUR 200 million as Europe&#x27;s eight largest box office market ahead of Sweden and Switzerland with a clear gap to the top 6 markets all of which registered GBO between EUR 504 million (Spain) up to over EUR 1 billion in France, the UK, Germany and the Russian Federation. Cinema going is comparatively cheap in Turkey. In 2013 a cinema ticket cost an average of EUR 4.0 in Turkey, and this was estimated to be the lowest average ticket price – measured in Euro – in Europe, marginally cheaper than in several Central and Eastern Europe markets like Croatia, Romania, Lithuania or Bulgaria (subject to exchange rates).

===Egypt===

A limited number of silent films were made in Egypt beginning in 1896; 1927&#x27;s &quot;Laila&quot; was notable as the first full-length feature. Cairo&#x27;s film industry became a regional force with the coming of sound. Between 1930 and 1936, various small studios produced at least 44 feature films. In 1936, Studio Misr, financed by industrialist Talaat Harb, emerged as the leading Egyptian equivalent to Hollywood&#x27;s major studios, a role the company retained for three decades. Of the more than 4,000 short and feature-length films made in MENA region since 1908, more than three-quarters were Egyptian films. Egyptian films are typically spoken in the Egyptian Arabic dialect.

Since 1976, Cairo has held the annual Cairo International Film Festival (CIFF), which is accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Association. In 1996, the Egyptian Media Production City (EMPC) was inaugurated in 6th of October City south of Cairo, although by 2001, only one of the 29 planned studios was operational. Censorship, formerly an obstacle to freedom of expression, has decreased remarkably by 2012, when the Egyptian cinema had begun to tackle boldly issues ranging from sexual issues to heavy government criticism.

The 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s are generally considered the golden age of Egyptian cinema. As in the West, films responded to the popular imagination, with most falling into predictable genres (happy endings being the norm), and many actors making careers out of playing strongly typed parts. In the words of one critic, &quot;If an Egyptian film intended for popular audiences lacked any of these prerequisites, it constituted a betrayal of the unwritten contract with the spectator, the results of which would manifest themselves in the box office.&quot; Since the 1990s, Egypt&#x27;s cinema has gone in separate directions. Smaller art films attract some international attention but sparse attendance at home. Popular films, often broad comedies such as &quot;What A Lie!&quot;, and the extremely profitable works of comedian Mohamed Saad, battle to hold audiences either drawn to Western films or, increasingly, wary of the perceived immorality of film.

=== Korean Peninsula ===

The term cinema of Korea (or Korean cinema) encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.

South Korean films enjoyed a &quot;Golden age&quot; during the late 1950s and 1960s. By 2005 South Korea had become one of few nations to watch more domestic than imported films in theaters due largely to laws placing limits on the number of foreign films able to be shown per theater per year. In the theaters, Korean films must be played for 73 days per year since 2006. On cable TV 25% domestic film quota will be reduced to 20% after KOR-US FTA.
The cinema of South Korea had a total box office gross in the country in 2015 of ₩ and had 113,000,000 admissions, 52% of the total admissions. 

===Poland===

The history of Cinema of Poland is almost as long as the history of cinematography, and it has universally recognized achievements, even though Polish films tend to be less commercially available than films from several other European nations.

After World War II, the communist government built an auteur-based national cinema, trained hundreds of new directors, and empowered them to make films. Filmmakers like Roman Polański, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Agnieszka Holland, Andrzej Wajda, Andrzej Żuławski, Andrzej Munk, and Jerzy Skolimowski impacted the development of Polish film-making. In more recent years, the industry has been producer-led with finance being the key to a film being made, and with many independent filmmakers of all genres, Polish productions tend to be more inspired by American film.

The Polish Film School was under the heavy influence of Italian neorealists. It took advantage of the liberal changes in Poland after 1956 Polish October to portray the complexity of Polish history during World War II and German occupation. Among the most important topics were the generation of former Home Army soldiers and their role in post-war Poland and the national tragedies like the German concentration camps and the Warsaw Uprising. The political changes allowed the group to speak more openly about the recent history of Poland. However, the rule of censorship was still strong when it came to history after 1945 and there were very few films on contemporary events. This marked the major difference between the members of the Polish Film School and Italian neorealists.

The Polish Film School was the first to underline the national character of Poles and one of the first artistic movements in Central Europe to openly oppose the official guidelines of Socialist realism. The members of the movement tend to underline the role of the individual as opposed to collectivity. There were two trends within the movement: young directors such as Andrzej Wajda generally studied the idea of heroism, while another group (the most notable being Andrzej Munk) analyzed the Polish character via irony, humor, and dissection of national myths.

===Indonesia===
The biggest film studio in Southeast Asia was soft opened on 5 November 2011 on 10 hectares of land in Nongsa, Batam Island, Indonesia. Infinite Frameworks (IFW) is a Singapore-based company (close to Batam Island) which is owned by a consortium, 90 percent of which is held by Indonesian businessman and film producer Mike Wiluan. In 2010–2011, due to the substantial increase in value-added tax applied to foreign films, cinemas no longer had access to many foreign films, including Oscar-winning films. Foreign films include major box offices from the West and other major film producers of the world. This caused a massive ripple effect on the country&#x27;s economy. It is assumed that this increased the purchase of unlicensed DVDs. However, even copyright-violating DVDs took longer to obtain. The minimum cost to view a foreign film not screened locally was 1 million Rupiah. This was equivalent to US$100, as it includes a plane ticket to Singapore.

=== Pakistan ===

The cinema of Pakistan, or simply Pakistani cinema (), refers to Pakistan&#x27;s film industry. Most of the feature films shot in Pakistan are in Urdu, the national language, but may also include films in English, the official language, and regional languages such as Punjabi, Pashto, Balochi, and Sindhi. Lahore has been described as the epicenter of Pakistani cinema, giving rise to the term &quot;Lollywood&quot; as a portmanteau of Lahore and Hollywood.

Before the separation of Bangladesh, Pakistan had three main film production centers: Lahore, Karachi and Dhaka. The regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, VCRs, film piracy, the introduction of entertainment taxes, strict laws based upon ultra-conservative jurisprudence, was an obstacle to the industry&#x27;s growth. Once thriving, the cinema in Pakistan had a sudden collapse in the 1980s and by the 2000s &quot;an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out few movies.&quot; However, the boom in the Television Industry in Karachi which gave rise to bigger privately owned media houses led to a revival of the Pakistan Film Industry in the early 2010s. Karachi, now the biggest production center of the Film Industry in Pakistan produces Urdu, English, and Sindhi language Pakistani movies. Lahore is the second big film producer now (mostly Punjabi movies) followed by Peshawar where mostly Pashto films are produced. Films are also being produced on a very small scale from Islamabad (Urdu and English movies) and Quetta (Balochi movies). Pakistani films are gaining market in the local circuit and international markets like Gulf countries, UK-Europe, US-North America, and Far-East. Many Pakistani movies made their ways to Oscars&#x27; foreign language film category i.e. The Day Shall Dawn (1959), The Veil (Ghoonghat) (1963), Zinda Bhaag (2013), Dukhtar (2014), Moor (2015), Mah-e-Mir (2016), Saawan (2017), Cake (2018), Lal Kabootar (2019). Two Pakistani documentary films won the Oscars&#x27; for the best documentary film, these are, Saving Face (2012) and A Girl in the River (2016). 
Pakistani movies especially Urdu movies revolve around family drama, romance, love stories, comedy, thriller, social matters, and political issues. In the contemporary era some Pakistani films have gained international acclaim, these include, Khuda Kay Liye (In the name of God), Bol, Verna, Zinda Bhaag, Load-Wedding, Wrong No., Cake, Teefa in Trouble, Lal Kabootar, Mah-e-Meer, Moor, The Legend of Maula Jatt.

Punjabi cinema is mostly themed on romance, family drama, and action while Pashto cinema revolves around action and tribal feuds.

Major Film Awards include Lux Style Awards, ARY Film Awards, Nigar Awards and National Film Awards.

===Philippines===
Cinema of the Philippines began with the introduction of the first moving pictures to the country on August 31, 1897, at the &quot;Salón de Pertierra&quot; in Manila. The following year, local scenes were shot on film for the first time by a Spaniard, Antonio Ramos, using the Lumiere Cinematograph. While most early filmmakers and producers in the country were mostly wealthy enterprising foreigners and expatriates, on September 12, 1919, &quot;Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden)&quot;, a movie based on a popular musical play, was the first movie made and shown by Filipino filmmaker José Nepomuceno. Dubbed the &quot;Father of Philippine Cinema&quot;, his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines.

===Israel===
Films have been made in Israel since before independence in 1948. The industry is relatively small economically but Israeli films have been nominated for more Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film than any other country in the Middle East. The government is attempting to attract foreign companies to film in Israel by offering subsidies for production costs.

=== Hong Kong ===


Hong Kong is a filmmaking hub for the Chinese-speaking world (including the worldwide diaspora) and East Asia in general. For decades it was the third-largest motion picture industry in the world (after India and the US) and the second-largest exporter of films. Despite an industry crisis starting in the mid-1990s and Hong Kong&#x27;s return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 Hong Kong film has retained much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinema stage. Unlike many film industries, Hong Kong has enjoyed little to no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas. It has always been a thoroughly commercial cinema, concentrating on crowd-pleasing genres, like comedy and action, and heavily reliant on formulas, sequels, and remakes. Typically of commercial cinemas, its heart is a highly developed star system, which in this case also features substantial overlap with the pop music industry

The Trinidad and Tobago Film Company is the national agency that was established in 2006 to further the development of the film industry. Trinidad and Tobago puts on several film festivals which are organized by different committees and organizations. These include the Secondary Schools Short Film Festival and Smartphone Film Festival organized by Trinidad and Tobago Film Company. There is also an annual Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival which runs for two weeks in the latter half of September.

=== Trinidad and Tobago ===

Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s film sector began emerging in the late 1950s to early 1960s and by the late 1970s, there were a handful of local productions, both feature film and television. The first full-length feature film to be produced in Trinidad and Tobago was &quot;The Right and the Wrong&quot; (1970) by Indian director/writer/producer, Harbance Kumar. The screenplay was written by the Trinidadian playwright, Freddie Kissoon. The rest of the 20th century saw a couple more feature films being made in the country, with &quot;Bim&quot; (1974), being singled out by Bruce Paddington as &quot;one of the most important films to be produced in Trinidad and Tobago ...  and one of the classics of Caribbean cinema.&quot; It was one of the first films to feature an almost entirely Trinidadian cast and crew. There was a rise in Trinidadian film production in the 2000s. Films such as &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; (2004), &quot;SistaGod&quot; (2006), &quot;I&#x27;m Santana: The Movie&quot; (2012), and &quot;God Loves the Fighter&quot; (2013) were released both locally and internationally. &quot;SistaGod&quot; had its world premiere at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.

=== Nepal ===
Nepali film does not have a very long film history, but the industry has its place in the cultural heritage of the country. It is often referred to as &#x27;Nepali Chalchitra&#x27; (which translates to &quot;Nepali films&quot; in English). The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of &quot;Kathmandu&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;; &quot;Kollywood&quot; however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema. Chhakka Panja has been considered the highest-grossing film of all time in Nepali film industry and Kohinoor the second highest. The Nepali films The Black Hen (2015) and Kagbeni (2006) received international acclaim. The Nepali feature film White Sun (Seto Surya) received the Best Film award at the 27th Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF) in 2016.

== History ==

Les frères Lumière released the first projection with the Cinematograph, in Paris on 28 December 1895. The French film industry in the late 19th century and early 20th century was the world&#x27;s most important. Auguste and Louis Lumière invented the cinématographe and their L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un train en gare de La Ciotat in Paris in 1895 is considered by many historians as the official birth of cinematography.
The first feature film to be made was the 1906 Australian silent &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot;, an account of the notorious gang led by Ned Kelly that was directed and produced by the Melburnians Dan Barry and Charles Tait. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.

In the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.

=== Introduction of film industry ===
In 1900, Charles Pathé began film production under the Pathé-Frères brand, with Ferdinand Zecca hired to make the films. By 1905, Pathé was the largest film company in the world, a position it retained until World War I. Léon Gaumont began film production in 1896, supervised by Alice Guy.

Besides American Mutoscope, there were also numerous smaller producers in the United States, and some of them established a long-term presence in the new century. American Vitagraph, one of these minor producers, built studios in Brooklyn, and expanded its operations in 1905.

The first successful permanent theatre showing only films was &quot;The Nickelodeon&quot;, which was opened in Pittsburgh in 1905. By then, there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a program running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors in the United States quickly followed suit, and within two years, there were 8,000 of these nickelodeons in operation across the United States. The American experience led to a worldwide boom in the production and exhibition of films from 1906 onwards.

Movie theaters became popular entertainment venues and social hubs in the early 20th century, much like cabarets and other theaters.

By 1907, purpose-built cinemas for motion pictures were being opened across the United States, Britain, and France. The films were often shown with the accompaniment of music provided by a pianist, though there could be more musicians. There were also very few larger cinemas in some of the biggest cities. Initially, the majority of films in the programs were Pathé films, but this changed fairly quickly as the American companies cranked up production. The program was made up of just a few films, and the show lasted around 30 minutes. The reel of film, of maximum length , which usually contained one individual film, became the standard unit of film production and exhibition in this period. The program was changed twice or more a week but went up to five changes of program a week after a couple of years. In general, cinemas were set up in the established entertainment districts of the cities. In 1907, Pathé began renting their films to cinemas through film exchanges rather than selling the films outright.

The litigation over patents between all the major American film-making companies had continued, and at the end of 1908, they decided to pool their patents and form a trust to use them to control the American film business. The companies concerned were Pathé, Edison, Biograph, Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, Essanay, Kalem, and the Kleine Optical Company, a major importer of European films. The George Eastman company, the only manufacturer of film stock in the United States, was also part of the combine, which was called the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), and Eastman Kodak agreed to only supply the members with film stock. License fees for distributing and projecting films were extracted from all distributors and exhibitors. The producing companies that were part of the trust were allocated production quotas (two reels, i.e. films, a week for the biggest ones, one reel a week for the smaller ones), which were supposed to be enough to fill the programs of the licensed exhibitors. But the market was bigger than that, for although 6,000 exhibitors signed with the MPPC, about 2,000 others did not. A minority of the exchanges (i.e. distributors) stayed outside the MPPC, and in 1909 these independent exchanges immediately began to fund new film-producing companies. By 1911 there were enough independent and foreign films available to programme all the shows of the independent exhibitors, and in 1912 the independents had nearly half of the market. The MPPC had effectively been defeated in its plan to control the whole United States market, and the government antitrust action, which only now started against the MPPC, was not necessary to defeat it.

In the early 20th century, before Hollywood, the United States motion picture industry was mainly based in Fort Lee, New Jersey across the Hudson River from New York City. In need of a winter headquarters, moviemakers were attracted to Jacksonville, Florida due to its warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, and cheaper labor, earning the city the title of &quot;The Winter Film Capital of the World&quot;. New York-based Kalem Studios was the first to open a permanent studio in Jacksonville in 1908. over the next decade, more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town, including Metro Pictures (later MGM), Edison Studios, Majestic Films, King-Bee Film Company, Vim Comedy Company, Norman Studios, Gaumont Studios and the Lubin Manufacturing Company. The first motion picture made in Technicolor and the first feature-length color movie produced in the United States, The Gulf Between, was also filmed on location in Jacksonville in 1917.

Jacksonville was especially important to the African American film industry. One notable individual in this regard is the European American producer Richard Norman, who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of Oscar Micheaux and the Lincoln Motion Picture Company. In contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, Norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring African Americans in what he termed &quot;splendidly assuming different roles&quot;.

Jacksonville&#x27;s mostly conservative residents, however, objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat John W. Martin was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city&#x27;s movie industry. By that time, southern California was emerging as the major movie production center, thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like William Selig and D.W. Griffith to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination.

Another factor for the industry&#x27;s move west was that up until 1913, most American film production was still carried out around New York, but due to the monopoly of Thomas A. Edison, Inc.&#x27;s film patents and its litigious attempts to preserve it, many filmmakers moved to Southern California, starting with Selig in 1909. The sunshine and scenery was important for the production of Westerns, which came to form a major American film genre with the first cowboy stars, G.M. Anderson (&quot;Broncho Billy&quot;) and Tom Mix. Selig pioneered the use of (fairly) wild animals from a zoo for a series of exotic adventures, with the actors being menaced or saved by the animals. Kalem Company sent film crews to places in America and abroad to film stories in the actual places they were supposed to have happened. Kalem also pioneered the female action heroine from 1912, with Ruth Roland playing starring roles in their Westerns.

In France, Pathé retained its dominant position, followed still by Gaumont, and then other new companies that appeared to cater to the film boom. A film company with a different approach was Film d&#x27;Art. Film d&#x27;Art was set up at the beginning of 1908 to make films of a serious artistic nature. Their declared program was to make films using only the best dramatists, artists, and actors. The first of these was &quot;L&#x27;Assassinat du Duc de Guise&quot; (&quot;The Assassination of the Duc de Guise&quot;), a historical subject set in the court of Henri III. This film used leading actors from the Comédie-Française and had a special accompanying score written by Camille Saint-Saëns. The other French majors followed suit, and this wave gave rise to the English-language description of films with artistic pretensions aimed at a sophisticated audience as &quot;art films&quot;. By 1910, the French film companies were starting to make films as long as two, or even three reels, though most were still one reel long. This trend was followed in Italy, Denmark, and Sweden.

In Britain, the Cinematograph Act 1909 was the first primary legislation to specifically regulate the film industry. Film exhibitions often took place in temporary venues and the use of highly flammable cellulose nitrate for film, combined with limelight illumination, created a significant fire hazard. The Act specified a strict building code which required, amongst other things, that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure.

The Babelsberg Studio near Berlin in Germany was the first large-scale film studio in the world, founded in 1912, and the forerunner to Hollywood with its several establishments of large studios in the early 20th century.

=== Hollywood ===
The first movie studio in Hollywood area, Nestor Studios, was founded in 1911 by Al Christie for David Horsley. Other East Coast studios had already moved production to Los Angeles. Over time, Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word &quot;Hollywood&quot; is now used colloquially to refer to the entire American film industry.

In 1913 Cecil B. DeMille, in association with Jesse Lasky, leased a barn with studio facilities in Hollywood where &quot;The Squaw Man&quot; (1914) was made. It is now the location of the Hollywood Heritage Museum.

The Charlie Chaplin Studios were built in 1917. The site was also used by Kling Studios, for the &quot; Superman&quot; TV series; Red Skelton, who used the sound stages for his CBS TV variety show; and CBS, which filmed the TV series &quot;Perry Mason&quot; there. From 1967 to 1999 it was the home of Herb Alpert&#x27;s A&amp;M Records and Tijuana Brass Enterprises. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named it a historical cultural monument. In 2000 it became the home of the Jim Henson Company, home of the Muppets. 

The noted Hollywood Sign originally read &quot;Hollywoodland&quot;. It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and removed the last four letters and repaired the others. It is a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.

The first Academy Awards presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929.

The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the &quot;Hollywood studio system&quot;, or the &quot;Golden Age of Hollywood&quot;. In a landmark 1948 court decision, the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and movie stars; thus an era of Hollywood history ended.

=== Hindi cinema ===

Bollywood is the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), Maharashtra, India. The term is often incorrectly used to refer to the whole of Indian cinema; however, it is only a part of the total Indian film industry, which includes other production centers producing films in multiple languages. Bollywood is the largest film producer in India and one of the largest centers of film production in the world.

Bollywood is formally referred to as Hindi cinema. Linguistically, Bollywood films tend to use vernacular Hindustani, mutually intelligible to self-identified speakers of both Hindi and Urdu, while modern Bollywood films also increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.

&quot;The Wrestlers&quot; (1899) and &quot;The Man and His Monkeys&quot; (1899), directed and produced by Harischandra Sakharam Bhatawdekar (H. S. Bhatavdekar), were the first two films made by Indian filmmakers, which were both short films. He was also the first Indian filmmaker to direct and produce the first documentary and news relnews-relateditled &quot;The Landing of Sir M.M. Bhownuggree&quot;.

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: India was buffeted by the Great Depression, World War II, the Indian independence movement, and the violence of the Partition. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly escapist, but several filmmakers tackled tough social issues or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.

In 1937 Ardeshir Irani, of &quot;Alam Ara&quot; fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, &quot;Kisan Kanya&quot;. The next year, he made another color film, a version of &quot;Mother India&quot;.

Following India&#x27;s independence, the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Hindi cinema. Defining key figures during this time included Raj Kapoor, Guru Dutt, Mehboob Khan, and Dilip Kumar.

The 1970s was when the name &quot;Bollywood&quot; was coined, and when the quintessential conventions of commercial Bollywood films were established. Key to this was the emergence of the masala film genre, which combines elements of multiple genres (action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama, musical). The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker Nasir Hussain, along with screenwriter duo Salim–Javed, pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format.

Tollywood is the Bengali language Film Industry of India. Started by Royal Bioscope Company in 1898 by Hiralal Sen, along with Matilal Sen, Deboki Lal Sen, and Bholanath Gupta. Combining live theater performances of actors, the Bengali industry was notable for using sound as an important part of the drama in its Bioscope format whose cinematic language was extremely different from Western silent films. This was followed by Jamshedji Framji Madan of the Elphinstone Bioscope Company who also controlled Madan Theatre Company. J J Madan became managing director of Madan Theatres after the death of his father in 1923 and Madan Theatres reached a peak in the late 1920s when it owned 127 theaters and controlled half of the country&#x27;s box office. Madan Theatres produced several popular and landmark films till 1937, parallel to works of &#x27;20s Bengali stars like Dhirendra Nath Ganguly who started the Indo-British Film Co. – the first Bengali-owned production company in 1918. The rise of the industry followed in the 1930s to 1940s when a diversity of films were made. Many prints were destroyed by fire. The prints and records of films from 1937 to 1947 films were majorly destroyed but this period in Bengal served as the age of political films in India which was supremely influential for the struggle for Indian Independence. After 1947, The industry saw a new era of creative studio-system collaborators who made films under the name of Agradoot. This saw a renaissance of commercial films and musicals where stars like Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen mesmerized the audience with their captivating screen presence and subdued performances. Ritwick Ghatak, Satyajit Ray, Tapan Sinha, Mrinal Sen, and Rituparno Ghosh were the other notable directors whose works influenced world cinema to an incomparable degree. The name of the industry was coined after the place Tollygunge, which also served as a cheeky tribute to Hollywood.

===Cairo===

The cinema of Egypt refers to the flourishing film industry based in Cairo which is known to be the Hollywood of the MENA region. In 1896, a limited number of silent films was made in Egypt beginning in 1896; 1927&#x27;s &quot;Laila&quot; was notable as the first full-length feature. Cairo&#x27;s film industry became a regional force with the coming of sound. Between 1930 and 1936, various small studios produced at least 44 feature films. In 1936, Studio Misr, financed by industrialist Talaat Harb, emerged as the leading Egyptian equivalent to Hollywood&#x27;s major studios, a role the company retained for three decades.

Historians disagree in determining the beginning of cinema in Egypt. Some say in 1896 when the first film was watched in Egypt, while others date the beginning from 20 June 1907 with a short documentary film about the visit of Khedive Abbas Hilmi II to the Institute of Mursi Abul-Abbas in Alexandria. In 1917, the director Mohammed Karim established a production company in Alexandria. The company produced two films: &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; and &quot;Honor the Bedouin&quot;, which were shown in the city of Alexandria in early 1918.

Since 1976, the capital has held the annual Cairo International Film Festival, which has been accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations. There is also another 12 festivals. Of the more than 4,000 short and feature-length films made in MENA region since 1908, more than three-quarters were Egyptian films. Egyptian films are typically spoken in the Egyptian Arabic dialect. Since then, more than 4,000 films have been produced in Egypt, three-quarters of the total Arab production. Historian Samir Kassir notes (2004) that Misr Studios in particular, &quot;despite their ups and downs, were to make Cairo the third capital of the world&#x27;s film industry, after Hollywood and Bombay but ahead of Italy&#x27;s Cinecittà.&quot; Egypt is the most productive country in the Middle East in the field of film production, and the one with the most developed media system.

===Nollywood===

Nollywood is a sobriquet that originally referred to the Nigerian film industry. The origin of the term dates back to the early 2000s, traced to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Due to the history of evolving meanings and contexts, there is no clear or agreed-upon definition for the term, which has made it a subject of several controversies.
The origin of the term &quot;Nollywood&quot; remains unclear; Jonathan Haynes traced the earliest usage of the word to a 2002 article by Matt Steinglass in &quot;the New York Times&quot;, where it was used to describe Nigerian cinema. Charles Igwe noted that Norimitsu Onishi also used the name in a September 2002 article he wrote for &quot;the New York Times&quot;. The term continues to be used in the media to refer to the Nigerian film industry, with its definition later assumed to be a portmanteau of the words &quot;Nigeria&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;, the American major film hub.

The definition of which films are considered Nollywood has always been a subject of debate. Alex Eyengho defined Nollywood as &quot;the totality of activities taking place in the Nigerian film industry, be it in English, Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, Itsekiri, Edo, Efik, Ijaw, Urhobo or any other of the over 300 Nigerian languages&quot;. He further stated that &quot;the historical trajectory of Nollywood started since the pre and post independent Nigeria, with the theatrical (stage) and cinematic (celluloid) efforts of the likes of Chief Hubert Ogunde, Chief Amata, Baba Sala, Ade Love, Eddie Ugbomah and a few others&quot;.
The Influence of the Nigerian movie industry often referred to informally as Nollywood has influenced all African countries.

By the end of 2013, the film industry reportedly hit a record-breaking revenue of ₦1.72 trillion (US$4.1 billion). As of 2014, the industry was worth ₦853.9 billion (US$5.1 billion), making it the third most valuable film industry in the world behind the United States and India. It made up about 1.4% of Nigeria&#x27;s GDP; this was attributed to the increase in the number of quality films produced and more formal distribution methods.

== Economics ==

The profitability of a film studio is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to film promotion, control over receipts through technologies such as digital rights management (DRM), sophisticated accounting practices, and management of ancillary revenue streams; in the extreme, for a major media franchise centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.

The film industry is a brutally competitive winner-take-all market driven by wildly fluctuating &quot;nonlinear processes&quot;. Box office revenue is highly concentrated in a small number of very successful films, and film industry market share is also highly concentrated in the film studios lucky enough to make such films. But the market is &quot;extremely volatile&quot; and it is impossible to predict in advance who will become the market winner at any given moment &quot;or how long their domination will last&quot;. The dominant films and film studios &quot;change places dramatically and often&quot;.

== Criticism ==

=== Censorship ===
Economic censorship happens when a company, industry, or country takes steps to ensure profitability, usually by self-censoring content to please the group wielding their economic influence. That group can be political such as the boycott of individuals or the banning or taxing by governments of certain products. This tool tends to have a broader reach beyond the borders of a government than pure political censorship. Examples include Hollywood self-censoring any negative depictions of Nazis for most of the 1930s to maintain access to German audiences and avoid upsetting anti-semites at home, or major studios self-censoring any negative depictions of China or its ruling party after 1997 to maintain access to Chinese audiences.

=== Covert advertising ===
Native advertising is information designed to persuade in more subtle ways than classic propaganda. A modern example common in the United States is copaganda, in which TV shows display unrealistically flattering portrayals of law enforcement, in part to borrow equipment and get their assistance in blocking off streets to more easily film on location. Other reputation laundering accusations have been leveled in the entertainment industry, including the burnishing the image of Mafia&#x27;s Godfathers.

Product placement also has been a point of criticism, with the tobacco industry promoting smoking on screen. The Centers for Disease Control cites that 51% of teen smokers would not start smoking if films with smoking were automatically given an &#x27;R&#x27; rating, which would save one million lives.

<text>Jeremiah Johnson is a 1972 American Western film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Robert Redford as the title character and Will Geer as &quot;Bear Claw&quot; Chris Lapp. It is based partly on the life of the legendary mountain man John Jeremiah Johnson, recounted in Raymond Thorp and Robert Bunker&#x27;s book &quot;Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson&quot; and Vardis Fisher&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Mountain Man&quot;.

The script was written by John Milius and Edward Anhalt; the film was shot at various locations in Redford&#x27;s adopted home state of Utah. It was entered into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival on May 7, 1972, and was later released on December 21, 1972 by Warner Bros. Pictures.

The film received very positive reviews from critics, and was a box office success, earning $44.7 million against a budget of $3.1 million, making it the 6th highest grossing film of 1972.

==Plot==
Mexican War veteran Jeremiah Johnson takes up the life of a mountain man, supporting himself in the Rocky Mountains as a trapper. His first winter in mountain country is difficult, and he has a run-in with Paints-His-Shirt-Red, a chief of the Crow tribe. He starts out with a .30-caliber Hawken percussion rifle, which he uses as his main rifle until he finds the frozen body of mountain man Hatchet Jack clutching a .50-caliber Hawken rifle. Jack&#x27;s will gives his rifle to the man who finds his corpse. With his new rifle, Johnson inadvertently disrupts the grizzly bear hunt of the elderly and eccentric Chris Lapp, nicknamed &quot;Bear Claw&quot;, who mentors him on living in the high country. After a brush with Crows, including Lapp&#x27;s acquaintance Paints-His-Shirt-Red, and learning the skills required to survive, Johnson sets off on his own.

He comes across a cabin whose inhabitants were apparently attacked by Blackfoot warriors, leaving only a woman and her uncommunicative son alive. The woman, maddened by grief, forces Johnson to adopt her son. He and the boy, whom Johnson dubs &quot;Caleb&quot;, come across Del Gue, a mountain man who has been robbed by the Blackfeet and buried by them up to his neck in sand. Gue persuades Johnson to help recover his stolen goods, but Johnson counsels against violence when they find the Blackfoot camp.

The men sneak into the camp at night to retrieve Gue&#x27;s possessions, but Gue opens fire and the mountain men then kill the Blackfeet. Gue takes several Blackfoot horses and scalps. Johnson, disgusted with the needless killing, returns to Caleb. Soon afterward, they are surprised by Christianized Flatheads, who take them in as guests of honor. Johnson unknowingly places the chief in his debt by giving him the Blackfeet horses and scalps. According to Flathead custom, to maintain his honor the chief must now either give his guest a greater gift or kill him. The chief gives his daughter Swan to be Johnson&#x27;s bride. After the wedding, Gue goes off on his own and Johnson, Caleb and Swan journey into the wilderness. Johnson finds a suitable location to build a cabin. They settle into this new home and slowly become a family.

This idyllic life is interrupted by the arrival of a U.S. Army cavalry rescue party tasked with saving a stranded wagon train of settlers. Although Johnson is reluctant, he is pressed into guiding the rescue party through the mountains, leaving his family alone at their cabin. During the journey, Lieutenant Mulvey orders the party to proceed directly through a sacred Crow burial ground against Johnson&#x27;s advice. Afterward, Johnson returns home by the same route and notices that the graves are now adorned with Swan&#x27;s blue trinkets; he rushes back to the cabin, where he finds both Swan and Caleb have been killed.

Johnson sets off after the warriors who killed his family and attacks them, killing all but one, a heavy-set man who sings his death song when he realizes he cannot escape. Johnson leaves him alive and the survivor spreads the tale of the mountain man&#x27;s quest for revenge throughout the region, trapping Johnson in a feud with the Crow. The tribe sends its best warriors one at a time to kill Johnson, but he defeats each one. His legend grows and the Crow come to respect him. He meets Gue again and returns to the cabin of Caleb&#x27;s mother, only to find that she has died and a new settler named Qualen and his family are living there. Nearby the Crow have built a monument to Johnson&#x27;s bravery, periodically leaving trinkets and talismans as tribute.

Johnson and Lapp meet for a final time. It is at this poignant meeting between student and teacher that Lapp realizes the heavy toll that fighting an entire nation alone in a vast and lonesome frontier has taken on Johnson. Lapp indicates as much when he remarks that Johnson has &quot;come far&quot;, to which Johnson replies &quot;Feels like far.&quot; Lapp then queries &quot;Were it worth the trouble?&quot; &quot;What trouble?&quot;, Johnson replies. Johnson later has a wordless encounter with Paints-His-Shirt-Red, presumed to be behind the attacks. While sitting astride their horses far apart, Johnson reaches for his rifle, but Paints-His-Shirt-Red raises his arm, open-palmed, in a gesture of peace that Johnson slowly returns, signaling an end to their conflict. The film ends with the song lyrics, &quot;And some folks say he&#x27;s up there still.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
In April 1968, producer Sidney Beckerman acquired the film rights to the biographical book &quot;Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson&quot; by Raymond W. Thorp Jr. and Robert Bunker. By May 1970, the rights were acquired by Warner Bros., who assigned John Milius to write a screen adaptation. Based roughly on &quot;Crow Killer&quot; as well as &quot;Mountain Man: A Novel of Male and Female in the Early American West&quot; by Vardis Fisher, Milius first scripted what would become known as &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; for $5,000 (); however, he was then hired to rewrite it several times and eventually earned $80,000 (). According to Milius, Edward Anhalt and David Rayfiel were brought in to work on the screenplay only for Milius to be continually rehired because no one else could do the dialogue. Milius says he got the idiom and American spirit from Carl Sandburg and was also influenced by Charles Portis&#x27;s novel &quot;True Grit&quot;.

The role of Jeremiah Johnson was originally intended for Lee Marvin and then Clint Eastwood, with Sam Peckinpah to direct. However, Peckinpah and Eastwood did not get along, so Peckinpah left and Eastwood decided to make &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; instead. Warner Bros. then stepped in and set up Milius&#x27;s screenplay for Robert Redford. Without a director, Redford talked Sydney Pollack into it; the two were looking for another film to collaborate on after &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot; (1966).

Casting for the role of Swan, Jeremiah&#x27;s wife, took three months. After auditioning for another role, actress Delle Bolton was spotted by the casting director, followed up by her participation in the UCLA School of Theatre Arts Hugh O&#x27;Brian Awards competition. Bolton then interviewed alongside 200 Native American women and eventually won the role, even though she herself was not Native American.

===Filming===
After Warner Bros. advanced Redford $200,000 to secure him for the film, Warner decided that the film had to be shot on the Studio&#x27;s backlot due to cost constraints. Insisting that it must be shot on location in Utah, Redford and Pollack convinced the studio that this could be done at the same cost. To prepare for production, art director Ted Haworth drove over 26,000 miles to find locations. Ultimately, it was shot in nearly one hundred locations across Utah, including: Mount Timpanogos, Ashley National Forest, Leeds, Snow Canyon State Park, St. George, Sundance Resort, Uinta National Forest, Wasatch-Cache National Forest, and Zion National Park.

Principal photography began in January 1971, but unexpected weather threatened production. Even after Pollack mortgaged his home to supplement the limited budget, production remained constrained. &quot;The snows of St. George in southern Utah were terrible,&quot; said Pollack, &quot;and we were using Cinemobiles as the lifelines. There was no way I was going to let it overrun, and Bob was a superb partner in keeping us tight. In the end it was the greatest way to learn production, because I was playing with my own money.&quot; Struggling with weather and the budget, rarely were the crew able to shoot any second takes.

The film took seven and a half months to edit. &quot;It&#x27;s a picture that was made as much in the editing room as it was in the shooting,&quot; said Pollack. &quot;It was a film where you used to watch dailies and everybody would fall asleep, except Bob and I, because all you had were these big shots of a guy walking his horse through the snow. You didn&#x27;t see strong narrative line. It&#x27;s a picture made out of rhythms and moods and wonderful performances.&quot;

===Music===
The score was composed by Tim McIntire and John Rubinstein (sung by Tim McIntire); known primarily as actors, they were also musicians. This was their film composing debut, arising after Rubinstein met Sydney Pollack through his agent. As Pollack recalls in the DVD commentary, McIntire and Rubinstein were &quot;kids that just auditioned with a tape.&quot;

The soundtrack L.P. was not released until 1976 by Warner Bros. Records. On October 5, 2009, a restored and extended version of the L.P. was released by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; had its world-wide premiere on May 7 at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, where it was screened in competition. It was the first Western film to ever be accepted in the festival. The film then held its American premiere on December 2 in Boise, Idaho, with its theatrical release in the United States beginning on December 21, 1972, in New York City.

The film earned $8,350,000 in U.S. &amp; Canadian rentals by the end of 1973. Reissues in 1974 and 1975 saw it earn additional rentals of $10,000,000 and $4 million respectively. In the U.S. and Canada it has grossed $44,693,786 with a reported reissue gross of $25,000,000.

===Home media===
The film was first released onto DVD by Warner Home Video on October 28, 1997. It was later released onto Blu-ray on May 1, 2012.

===Critical reception===
The film received generally positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it a &quot;Fresh&quot; rating of 91% based on reviews from 23 critics, with an average score of 7.1/10 and the site&#x27;s consensus stating: &quot;&quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;″s deliberate pace demands an investment from the viewer, but it&#x27;s rewarded with a thoughtful drama anchored by a starring performance from Robert Redford.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 75% based on reviews from 7 critics.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Roger Greenspun noted in his 1972 review, &quot;That it does not succeed entirely is perhaps less the fault of the actor or of the conception than of a screenplay that tends to be ponderous about its imponderables and that every so often sounds as if it might have been written by the authors of the Bible ... But for all its involvement with academic cinema art, &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; is full of compensations. There are [moments] of great beauty and terror and deeply earned pathos.&quot; A report in &quot;Variety&quot; from Cannes stated: &quot;The film has its own force and beauty and the only carp might lie in its not always clear exegesis of the humanistic spirit and freedom most of its characters are striving for. It is not a new-type Western, with its demystifications, dirt and underlining of the brutishness of the times, as well as its heroic aspects, but it does show a deeper insight into the Indian–white relations and benefits from superb direction, excellent lensing and sharp editing.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;Oddly enough, it is the violent scenes, the ones that don&#x27;t work within the story, in which Pollack excels. Jeremiah&#x27;s battle with a pack of wolves, and, later, a pack of Crow Indians, are stunning examples of direction and editing.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film for &quot;a rare and tonic authenticity,&quot; elaborating that &quot;the film does not so much reveal a way of life as thrust us inside it. Making fire with flint and steel looks the miserably frustrating job it is; hunting and fishing look as exasperating as they are; snow looks as cold as it is and hands have the numbed and purpled look it gives them.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; dismissed the film as &quot;rather ponderous&quot; as it &quot;just sort of moseys along, in an academically efficient way, without ever generating enough emotion or accumulating enough personal history. It&#x27;s remarkably even and remarkably uncompelling.&quot; Tom Milne of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Good as it is, with fine performances and superb camerawork by Andrew Callaghan, &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; still disappoints because it aims lower than it might have and does some sleight-of-hand to conceal the fact.&quot;

==Legacy==
The film inspired the creation of the classic Italian comics character (and his eponymous publicación) Ken Parker. Ken Parker is a Western anti-hero, based on Redford&#x27;s portrayal of Jeremiah Johnson.

Like Johnson, Parker is a trapper who had decided to escape from the first city to have appeared in the United States. The comic&#x27;s stories are mainly set in Northwestern states at first, but when Parker is forced to flee Boston after he participates in some strikes (initially as a Pinkerton agent and later as a supporter of the workers making the strikes), his new adventures are set along the Canadian frontier.

A moving gif image of Redford nodding during the film has subsequently become a widely used reaction meme/image macro.

==Early life==
Rosario Dawson was born on May 9, 1979, in New York City. Her mother, Isabel Celeste, is of Puerto Rican, Taíno, Cuban, and African ancestry. Isabel was 17 years old when Rosario was born; she never married Rosario&#x27;s biological father, Patrick C. Harris. When Dawson was a year old, Isabel married Greg Dawson, a construction worker. Isabel and Greg moved into a reclaimed building on East 13th Street after being approved as members of an affordable housing plan. The family later moved to Garland, Texas.

==Career==
As a child, Dawson made a brief appearance on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. At the age of 15, she was discovered on her front-porch step by photographer Larry Clark and Harmony Korine, with Korine deciding that she was perfect for a part he had written in his screenplay for the controversial 1995 film &quot;Kids&quot;. She went on to star in varied roles in independent films and blockbusters such as &quot;He Got Game&quot;, &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, and &quot;Rent&quot;.
In 1998, Dawson provided an introductory voice-over for the remixed version of Prince&#x27;s single &quot;1999&quot;.

==Activism and advocacy==
===Politics===

Dawson was arrested in 2004, while protesting against President George W. Bush.

Dawson endorsed Barack Obama for re-election in 2012, and Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 Democratic Party primaries. On April 15, 2016, Dawson was among the protesters arrested during Democracy Spring in Washington, DC.

In mid-2019, Dawson endorsed her boyfriend Cory Booker in the 2020 presidential election. Booker ended his campaign for president on January 13, 2020.

On March 9, 2020, Dawson endorsed the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, whom she had also previously endorsed in his 2016 bid.

===Philanthropy===

Dawson is involved with the Lower East Side Girls Club and supports other charities such as environmental group Global Cool, One Campaign, Oxfam, Operation USA, Amnesty International, Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), the International Rescue Committee, Voto Latino, and Stay Close.org, a poster and public service advertising campaign for PFLAG, where she is featured with her uncle Frank Jump. She has participated in the &quot;Vagina Monologues&quot; and serves on the board for V-Day, a global non-profit movement that raises funds for women&#x27;s anti-violence groups through benefits of this play.

In October 2008, Dawson became a spokeswoman for TripAdvisor.com&#x27;s philanthropy program, More Than Footprints, Conservation International, Doctors Without Borders, National Geographic Society, The Nature Conservancy, and Save the Children. Also in October 2008, she lent her voice to the RESPECT! Campaign, a movement aimed at preventing domestic violence. She recorded a voice message for the Giverespect.org Web site, stressing the importance of respect in helping stop domestic violence. In 2012, Dawson partnered with SodaStream International in launching the first annual Unbottle the World Day, a campaign conceived in an effort to raise awareness to the impact of cans and plastic bottles on the environment.

==Personal life==
Dawson is a self-professed Trekkie, who mentioned both her brothers and her love of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in an interview with Conan O&#x27;Brien.

Dawson adopted a 12-year-old girl, Isabella, in 2014. In December 2023, Dawson announced that Isabella was pregnant and her first grandchild was scheduled to be born in 2024.

In March 2019 until February 2022, Dawson was in a relationship with US Senator Cory Booker.

In 2018, Dawson made a post to Instagram that was widely perceived as her coming out as queer; when asked about this in a 2020 interview, she stated that this had not been her intention, and further specified that although &quot;People kept saying that I [came out]... I didn&#x27;t do that, ... I mean, it&#x27;s not inaccurate, but I never did come out. I mean, I guess I am now ... I&#x27;ve never had a relationship in that space, so it&#x27;s never felt like an authentic calling to me.&quot; A representative of Dawson later clarified to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; that she meant to say she came out as an ally of the LGBTQ community.

<text>JT-60 (short for Japan Torus-60) is a large research tokamak, the flagship of the Japanese National Institute for Quantum Science and Technology&#x27;s fusion energy directorate. As of 2023 the device is known as JT-60SA and is the largest operational superconducting tokamak in the world, built and operated jointly by the European Union and Japan in Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture. SA stands for super advanced tokamak, including a D-shaped plasma cross-section, superconducting coils, and active feedback control.

 JT-60 holds the record for the highest value of the fusion triple product achieved: = . To date, JT-60 has the world record for the hottest ion temperature ever achieved (522 million °C); this record defeated the TFTR machine at Princeton in 1996.

==Original design==
JT-60 was first designed in the 1970&#x27;s during a period of increased interest in nuclear fusion from major world powers. In particular, the US, UK and Japan were motivated by the excellent performance of the Soviet T-3 in 1968 to further advance the field. The Japanese Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI), previously dedicated to fission research since 1956, allocated efforts to fusion.

JT-60 began operations on April 8, 1985, and demonstrated performance far below predictions, much like the TFTR and JET that had begun operations shortly prior.

Over the next two decades, JET and JT-60 led the effort to regain the performance originally expected of these machines. JT-60 underwent a major modification during this time, JT-60U (for &quot;upgrade&quot;) in March 1991. The change resulted in significant improvements in plasma performance.

==JT-60U (Upgrade)==
The main objective of the JT-60U upgrade was to &quot;investigate energy confinement near the breakeven condition, [a] non-inductive current drive and burning plasma physics with deuterium plasmas.&quot; To accomplish this, the poloidal field coils and the vacuum vessel were replaced. Construction began in November 1989 and was completed in March 1991. Operations began in July.

On October 31, 1996, JT-60U successfully achieved extrapolated breakeven with a factor of &quot;Q&quot; = 1.05 at . In other words, if the homogenous deuterium fuel was theoretically replaced with a 1:1 mix of deuterium and tritium, the fusion reaction would have created an energy output 1.05 times the energy used to start the reaction. JT-60U was not equipped to utilize tritium, as it would add extensive costs and safety risks.

In February 1997, a modification to the divertor from an open-type shape to a semi-closed W-shape for greater particle and impurity control was started and later completed in May. Experiments simulating the helium exhaust in ITER were promptly performed with the modified divertor, with great success. In 1998, the modification allowed JT-60U to reach an extrapolated fusion energy gain factor of &quot;Q&quot; = 1.25 at .

In December 1998, a modification to the vacuum pumping system that began in 1994 was completed. In particular, twelve turbomolecular pumps with oil bearings and four oil sealed rotary vacuum pumps were replaced with magnetically suspended turbomolecular pumps and dry vacuum pumps. The modification reduced the 15-year-old system&#x27;s consumption of liquid nitrogen by two thirds.

In fiscal year 2003, the plasma discharge duration of JT-60U was successfully extended from to .

In 2005, ferritic steel (ferromagnet) tiles were installed in the vacuum vessel to correct the magnetic field structure and hence reduce the loss of fast ions. 
The JAEA used new parts in the JT-60, having improved its capability to hold the plasma in its powerful toroidal magnetic field.

Sometime in 2007-2008, in order to control plasma pressure at the pedestal region and to evaluate the effect of fuel on the self-organization structure of plasma, a supersonic molecular beam injection (SMBI) system was installed in JT-60U. The system&#x27;s design was a collaboration between Cadarache, CEA, and JAEA.

JT-60U ended operations on August 29, 2008.

==JT-60SA==

JT-60SA is the successor to JT-60U, operating as a satellite to ITER as described by the Broader Approach Agreement. It is a fully superconducting tokamak with flexible components that can be adjusted to find optimized plasma configurations and address key physics issues. Assembly began in January 2013 and was completed in March 2020. After a major short circuit during integrated commissioning in March 2021 necessitating lengthy repairs, it was declared active on December 1, 2023. The overall cost of its construction is estimated to be around , adjusted for inflation.

Weighing roughly , JT-60SA&#x27;s superconducting magnet system includes 18 D-shaped niobium-titanium toroidal field coils, a niobium-tin central solenoid, and 12 equilibrium field coils.

===History===
The idea of an advanced tokamak, a tokamak utilizing superconducting coils, traces back to the early 1960&#x27;s. The idea seemed very promising, but was not without its problems. Around January 1972, engineers at JAERI initiated an effort to further research the idea and try to solve its hurdles. This initiative progressed in parallel with the development of JT-60, and by 1983-84 it was decided that it constituted its own experimental reactor: FER (Fusion Experimental Reactor).

However, the JT-60U upgrade in 1991 demonstrated the significant flexibility of the JT-60 facilities and assembly site, so by January 1993 FER was designated as a modification to JT-60U and renamed JT-60SU (for Super Upgrade). 

In January 1996, a paper detailing the superconducting properties of NbAl composite wire and its fabrication process was published in the 16th International Cryogenic Engineering/Materials Conference journal. Engineers assessed the potential use of the aluminide in JT-60SU&#x27;s 18 toroidal coils.

Designs and intentions for the modification varied over the next decade, until February 2007, when the Broader Approach Agreement was signed between Japan and the European Atomic Energy Community. In it, the Satellite Tokamak Program established a clear, defined goal for JT-60SA: act as a small-scale ITER. This way, JT-60SA could give hindsight to engineers assembling and operating the full-scale reactor in the future.

It was planned for JT-60 to be disassembled and then upgraded to JT-60SA by adding niobium-titanium superconducting coils by 2010. 
It was intended for the JT60SA to be able to run with the same shape plasma as ITER. The central solenoid was designed to use niobium-tin (because of the higher (9 T) field). 

===Assembly===
Construction of the tokamak officially began on with the assembly of the cryostat base, which was shipped from Avilés, Spain over a 75-day long journey. The event was highly publicized through local and national news, and reporters from 10 media organizations were able to witness it in person.

Assembly of the vacuum vessel began in May 2014. The vacuum vessel was manufactured as ten sectors with varying arcs (20°x1, 30°x2, 40°x7) that had to be installed sequentially. On June 4, 2014 two of ten sectors were installed. In November 2014 seven sectors had been installed. In January 2015 nine sectors had been installed. 

Construction was to continue until 2020 with first plasma planned in September 2020. Assembly was completed on March 30, 2020, and in March 2021 it reached its full design toroidal field successfully, with a current of 25.7kA. 

===Short circuit===

On March 9, 2021, a coil energization test was being performed on equilibrium field coil no. 1 (EF1) when the coil current rapidly increased, then suddenly flatlined. The reactor was safely shut down over the next few minutes, during which the pressure in the cryostat increased from to . Investigations immediately followed.

The incident, which came to be known as the &quot;EF1 feeder incident&quot;, was found to be caused by a major short circuit resulting from insufficient insulation of the quench detection wire conductor exit. The formed arc damaged the shells of EF1, causing a helium leak to the cryostat.

In total, 90 locations required repairs and machine sensors needed to be rewired. However, the intricate JT-60SA was designed and assembled with intense precision, meaning access to the machine was sometimes limited. Risks of further delay to plasma operations compounded the issue.

The JT-60SA team was disappointed with the incident, given how close the machine was to operation, but persevered.

Repairs were completed in May 2023 and preparations for operation began.

===Present operations===
JT-60SA achieved first plasma on October 23, 2023, making it the largest operational superconducting tokamak in the world as of 2024. The reactor was declared active on December 1, 2023.

<text>The New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) was the title of the military forces sent from New Zealand to fight alongside other British Empire and Dominion troops during World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945). Ultimately, the NZEF of World War I became known as the &quot;First New Zealand Expeditionary Force&quot;. The NZEF of World War II was known as the &quot;Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force&quot; (2NZEF).

The 2NZEF was led by General Bernard Freyberg.

==1st New Zealand Expeditionary Force==

The New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) was the title of the military forces sent from New Zealand to fight for Britain during World War I. Upon the outbreak of war, New Zealand immediately offered to provide two brigades—one of infantry and one of mounted troops—with a total of 8,500 men. As was the case with the Australian army the existing New Zealand army was a &quot;territorial&quot; force, designed for the defense of the home islands. It could not be deployed overseas. Hence, it was necessary to form a volunteer &quot;expeditionary&quot; force. The initial contingent of the NZEF, known as the &quot;Main Body,&quot; sailed on 16 October 1914 for Australia and then joined with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in a convoy that sailed for Egypt on 1 November. The NZEF and AIF convoy was originally bound for Britain but diverted en route to Egypt because of the state of the training camps in England. As a result, the troops were dressed in woolen uniforms for the British climate. On 2 December the convoy reached Alexandria after passing through the Suez Canal. Disembarking the troops traveled by train for Cairo, bivouacking in tent camps within sight of the Pyramids.

The NZEF was commanded throughout the war by Major General Alexander Godley, a British Army officer who in 1910, on the recommendation of Lord Kitchener, had been appointed as the commander of the New Zealand Military Forces. After Godley departed with the NZEF in October 1914, Major General Alfred William Robin commanded the New Zealand Military Forces at home throughout the war as commandant, and was pivotal in ensuring the ongoing provision of reinforcements and support to the NZEF.

Major General George Napier Johnston CB CMG DSO (1867–1947) served with New Zealand forces during World War I as director of ordnance and commander of permanent artillery in the New Zealand Defence Force from the outset of World War I during 1914–1918.

New Zealand, like Australia, had a pre-war policy of compulsory military training, but, like Australia, New Zealand&#x27;s Territorial Army could not be deployed overseas. Thus, the NZEF was initially composed solely of volunteers. Conscription was introduced on 1 August 1916 and by the end of the war 124,000 men—nearly half the eligible male population of 250,000—had served with the NZEF. Of these, about 100,000 had been sent overseas.

The NZEF was closely tied to the AIF for much of the war. When the Gallipoli campaign began, the New Zealand contingent was insufficient to complete a division of their own, so it was combined with the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division under the command of General Godley. This division, along with the Australian 1st Division, formed the famous Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) under the command of General William Birdwood.

After the end of the Gallipoli campaign, the NZEF formed its own infantry division, the New Zealand Division, which served on the Western Front for the rest of the war. General Godley was promoted to a corps command and given II ANZAC Corps, which contained the New Zealand Division. From 1916 until the formation of the Australian Corps in 1918 (made up of the five Australian divisions) there were always two &quot;ANZAC&quot; corps—I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps—despite the fact that there was only one New Zealand Division. During early 1916 the New Zealand Government supported the formation of an Australian and New Zealand Army, but this did not occur.

The mounted arm of the NZEF was the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. The brigade remained in Egypt and, combined with the 1st and 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigades, made up the ANZAC Mounted Division which served through the Sinai and Palestine campaign.

The New Zealand Expeditionary Force (later called the 1st NZEF) was finally disbanded on 31 December 1921.

==2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force==
===Formation===

At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the New Zealand Government declared war on Germany. Within a few days, the government pronounced the assembly of what would be an Expeditionary Force, which become known as the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), for service in the war. After consulting with the British Government, it was decided to raise an infantry division. This, the 2nd New Zealand Division, would be commanded by Major-General Bernard Freyberg, a British Army officer who had spent his early years in New Zealand and won a Victoria Cross in the First World War, ending it as a brigadier general, who had offered his services to the New Zealand Government. Freyberg would also be the commander of the 2NZEF.

===Service in Africa and Europe===
The first echelon of 2NZEF Headquarters and a Brigade Group landed in Egypt in February 1940. The second echelon, also a Brigade Group, was diverted to Britain on Italy&#x27;s entry into the war and did not reach Egypt until March 1941. The third echelon arrived in Egypt in September 1940 and concentration of the division was completed just before it was deployed to northern Greece in March 1941.

This force remained as part of the British Eighth Army to the end of World War II in 1945 during which it fought in the Battle of Greece (March–April 1941), the Battle of Crete (May), Operation Crusader (November–December), Minqar Qaim (June 1942), the First (July) and Second Battles of El Alamein (October–November), Libya and Tunisia (December–May 1943), the Sangro (October–December), the Battle of Monte Cassino (February–March 1944), the Central Italy (May–December), and the Adriatic Coast (April–May 1945).

Under the command of Major-General William Stevens, the 2NZEF began demobilising in late 1945, a process that was largely completed by mid-1946. Lt. Gen John C. H. Lee, Deputy Theater Commander of the Mediterranean Theater at this time, noted in his diary attending the termination ceremony of the New Zealand Force at Caserta, Italy on 3 September 1946.

===Service in the Pacific===
The 2NZEF also had a &quot;Pacific Section&quot;, which was initially responsible for the defence of Fiji. The basis for the Pacific Section was initially an infantry brigade—the 8th Infantry Brigade—which arrived on Viti Levu, the main island of Fiji, in November 1940. Following the entry of the Japanese Empire into the war, in early 1942, the 2NZEF contingent in Fiji was expanded to two brigades, and formally designated &quot;Pacific Section, 2NZEF&quot;. Under the command of Major General Owen Mead, the Pacific Section was withdrawn from Fiji back to New Zealand when the United States 37th Division took over defence responsibility.

The Pacific Section later became the 3rd Division, the main unit of the 2NZEF in the Pacific. After of period of training in New Zealand, it fought in the Solomon Islands campaign during 1943–1944, participating in the Battles of Vella Lavella, the Treasury Islands and the Green Islands, although never as a full division.

In early 1944, the New Zealand Government faced a manpower crisis caused by the demands of maintaining two divisions overseas while simultaneously maintaining agricultural and industrial production to meet the needs of the Allied countries. In order to cope with this crisis the New Zealand Government saw no option other than to disband one of the country&#x27;s two infantry divisions. The decision to disband the 3rd Division was made after consulting with the British and United States Governments, who were of the view that the 2nd Division&#x27;s contribution to the campaign in Italy was of greater importance than the 3rd Division&#x27;s contribution in the Pacific.

The 3rd Division was withdrawn to New Caledonia in June 1944 and returned to New Zealand in August. The Division was rapidly downsized and was formally disbanded on 20 October 1944. About 4,000 veterans of the 3rd NZ Division were dispatched to Italy to reinforce the 2nd Division with the remaining men of the division returning to civilian employment.

==3rd New Zealand Expeditionary Force==
From 1950 onwards a division-sized force, reserves (Territorial Force) maintained by conscription, formed the principal striking force of the New Zealand Army. The division was alternatively known as 3NZEF. It disbanded in 1961.

<doc id="649492" wikidata="Q16199413" url="?curid=649492" title="Murder of Jacob Wetterling">
<text>Jacob Erwin Wetterling (February17, 1978October22, 1989) was an American boy from St. Joseph, Minnesota, who was kidnapped from his hometown and murdered on October 22, 1989, at the age of 11. The identity of his abductor remained a mystery for nearly 27 years.

On September 1, 2016, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) recovered human bones from a pasture near Paynesville, about from the site of the abduction. On September 3, Wetterling&#x27;s family announced that the bones were those of Jacob, and local law enforcement stated that the identity of the bones had been confirmed by dental records. The location was revealed by Danny Heinrich, a long-time person of interest in the abduction of another boy, 12-year-old Jared Scheierl, in the nearby town of Cold Spring. On September 6, 2016, Heinrich confessed to kidnapping and murdering Wetterling, as well as abducting and sexually assaulting Scheierl.

==Kidnapping==

On Sunday, October 22, 1989, just after 9:00 p.m. (CDT), Jacob Wetterling (11), his younger brother Trevor Wetterling (10), and a friend, Aaron Larson (11), were biking home from a convenience store in St. Joseph, Minnesota, where they had gone to rent a video. Danny Heinrich, wearing a stocking cap mask and armed with an unloaded revolver, came out of a driveway and ordered the boys to throw their bikes into a ditch and lie face down on the ground. He then asked each boy how old they were. Jacob&#x27;s brother was told to run toward a nearby wooded area and not look back or else he would be shot. Heinrich then demanded to view the faces of the two remaining boys. He picked Jacob and told Aaron to run away, threatening him as he had Jacob&#x27;s brother. This was the last time Jacob was seen alive by anyone other than his captor.

==Investigation==
On January 13, 1989, roughly nine months before the Wetterling abduction, 12-year-old Jared Scheierl was kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and physically threatened by an unknown adult man in Cold Spring, Minnesota. The victim&#x27;s statement given on that night showed the &quot;modus operandi&quot; was similar to that of the Wetterling case: the perpetrator, who was later identified as Heinrich, used a gun and, upon releasing the boy, told him to run and not look back or else he would be shot. That incident occurred from where he would later stop the Wetterling brothers and their friend.

==Person of interest==
In May 2014, investigators confirmed that they were taking another look at a series of attempted and actual child molestations that had occurred in the Paynesville area in the two years preceding the Wetterling abduction. Between the summer of 1986 and the spring of 1987, five teenage boys were attacked, but no one was arrested. The authorities interviewed some of the victims again and worked with the Internet blogger who had brought the information to light. After months of research and interviews with some of the victims, investigators believed that these attacks were not random and that the culprit could be connected to the abduction of Wetterling, which occurred just 40 minutes from the other crime scenes.

===Danny James Heinrich===
In October 2015, Danny James Heinrich was publicly named as a person of interest in Jacob Wetterling&#x27;s disappearance. He had been questioned by the FBI on December 16, 1989, and a DNA sample was taken, but he was not charged with a crime and was released. In 2015, Heinrich&#x27;s DNA was matched to the DNA taken in the case of Jared Scheierl, who was abducted in nearby Cold Spring in January 1989 at the age of twelve. The statute of limitations had expired for the Cold Spring kidnapping, meaning Heinrich could not be arrested and charged with that crime. A search warrant was issued and child sexual abuse material was found in Heinrich&#x27;s house, leading to his arrest on October 28, 2015.

===Plea and discovery===
Heinrich decided to cooperate with authorities as part of a plea bargain and, on September 1, 2016, led investigators to a burial site. Jacob&#x27;s clothing and human remains were unearthed from a pasture near Paynesville, about away from the Wetterling home and the abduction site and a short distance from where Heinrich was living in 1989. On September 3, the remains were confirmed through dental records to be Jacob&#x27;s. His mother, Patty Wetterling, told television station KARE11, a local NBC affiliate, that the remains found were indeed Jacob&#x27;s. She said: &quot;All I can confirm is that Jacob has been found and our hearts are broken. I am not responding to any media yet as I have no words.&quot;

In the plea agreement, Heinrich agreed to plead guilty to one count of the 25 federal child pornography charges brought against him. In addition to revealing the location of the body and pleading guilty, he also agreed to testify as to the details of the Wetterling crime. At a hearing before Judge John Tunheim of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Heinrich testified that he kidnapped and handcuffed the boy, drove him to a gravel pit near Paynesville, molested him, killed him and buried his body. Heinrich said that he was able to avoid police that night by listening to a police scanner. He said that he came back to the site a year later and moved the body after noticing that Wetterling&#x27;s jacket had become exposed. During the court hearing, Heinrich also admitted to kidnapping and sexually assaulting Jared Scheierl earlier that year.

In exchange for Heinrich&#x27;s plea, the prosecutors agreed not to charge him with Wetterling&#x27;s murder. In accordance with the plea agreement, Heinrich was sentenced to the maximum prison term of 20 years for the child pornography charge. In addition, the plea deal will allow state authorities to seek his civil commitment as a sexual predator at the end of his federal prison term, which could prevent him from ever going free. In sentencing Heinrich, Judge Tunheim said:

We won&#x27;t pretend that this crime and sentence is about child pornography. It is also about changing the lives of so many children and parents, who prayed for Jacob&#x27;s return, and also feared you coming out of the dark ... every child knows the story of Jacob Wetterling. You stole the innocence of children in small towns, in the cities of Minnesota and beyond.

Although Heinrich could be released in 17 years from the start of his prison sentence, Judge Tunheim told him that it was unlikely, as &quot;this crime is so heinous, so brutal and awful that it is unlikely society will ever let you go free.&quot;

In January 2017, Heinrich was transferred to Federal Medical Center, Devens, a federal prison in Massachusetts, to serve his 20-year sentence.

==Legacy==
Four months after Wetterling&#x27;s abduction, his parents, Jerry and Patty Wetterling, formed the Jacob Wetterling Foundation, an advocacy group for children&#x27;s safety. In 1994, the federal Jacob Wetterling Act was passed and named for Jacob. It was the first law to institute a state sex-offender registry. The law has been amended several times, most famously by Megan&#x27;s Law in 1996 and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act in 2006.

In 2008, the foundation started by Jacob&#x27;s parents became the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center. It carries on the work started by the Wetterling family &quot;to educate the public about who takes children, how they do it and what each of us can do to stop it&quot;.

The Bridge of Hope, a crossing of the Mississippi River near St. Cloud, is named in Jacob&#x27;s honor.

== Connection between Heinrich and Duane Hart ==
After the arrest was made, media reported that according to a friend of the family both Heinrich and his brother were themselves sexually abused by a man then dating their mother, later convicted sex offender Duane Hart, when they were children. Hart has been described as a man who &quot;would come along, if you were a single woman with kids, pretend he likes you and that would be it.&quot; Hart in turn had implicated Heinrich as early as 1991 regarding the Wetterling case when he told investigators Heinrich had asked him how to dispose of a body and that he had seen suspicious objects at his home. The information was apparently not followed up on at the time.

<doc id="649494" wikidata="Q492067" url="?curid=649494" title="Buddhist music">
<text>Buddhist music is music (Sanskrit: vàdita&quot;,&quot; saṅgīta) created for or inspired by Buddhism and includes numerous ritual and non-ritual musical forms. As a Buddhist art form, music has been used by Buddhists since the time of early Buddhism, as attested by artistic depictions in Indian sites like Sanchi. While certain early Buddhist sources contain negative attitudes to music, Mahayana sources tend to be much more positive to music, seeing it as a suitable offering to the Buddhas and as a skillful means to bring sentient beings to Buddhism.

Buddhist music retains a prominent place in many Buddhist traditions, and is usually used for ceremonial and devotional purposes. Buddhist music and chanting is often part of Buddhist rituals and festivals in which they may be seen as offerings to the Buddha.

Most Buddhist music includes chanting or singing, accompanied by instruments. The chanting is often of traditional texts which include: sutras, mantras, dharani, parittas, or verse compositions (such as gathas, stotras, and caryagitis). Buddhist instrumental music does exist, though it is less commonly heard in temples.

Examples of Buddhist musical traditions include the Newari Buddhist Gunlā Bājan, Tibetan Buddhist music, Japanese Buddhist Shōmyō, modern Indian Buddhist bhajans, and Cambodian Smot chanting. As there are many different traditions of Buddhist music and chanting, the musical instruments used vary widely, from solely relying on the human voice, to many types of classic instruments used in Asian music (such as the ancient Indian veena) as well as modern instruments (keyboards, guitars, etc).

In the modern academy, the study of Buddhist music, sometimes known as Buddhist musicology, has become its own field of academic research.

== In doctrine and scriptures ==


In Buddhism, chanting is a traditional Buddhist devotional practice, as well as a means of enhancing and preparing the mind for silent meditation. It is a common part of formal group practice (in either a lay or monastic context). Some forms of Buddhism also use chanting for ritualistic, apotropaic or other magical purposes.

In Mahayana Buddhism, the offering of music is a traditional part of devotional offerings to the Buddhas (others include water, flowers, and light). The offering of music is thus considered to bring good merit. The idea of music as an offering to the Buddhas can be found in various Mahayana sutras. Common instruments included the veena, drums, and flutes (venu).

Furthermore, in some Mahayana sources, Buddhist music is considered to be a skillful means (upaya), a way to guide people to the Buddhist path and to teach them the Buddha&#x27;s teachings. Some Mahayana sutras also depict the Pure Lands as filled with divine music.

=== In the early Buddhist sources ===
Various passages from the early Buddhist texts contain criticisms of musical performance directly from the Buddha. The main criticism is that music leads to sense desire and attachment, and is thus a hindrance to meditative concentration (samadhi), and to peace of mind. However, there are other passages in which the Buddha praises music and chanting.

Aside from textual sources, there are numerous depictions of musicians and musical instruments at ancient Indian Buddhist sites like Sanchi, and Amaravati, as well as at various Greco-Buddhist sites in Buddhist Gandhara, such as Chakhil-i-Ghoundi.

==== Against music ====
In the &quot;Ghitassara Sutta&quot; (Anguttara Nikaya 5.209), the Buddha admonishes Buddhist monks for reciting the teaching (Dhamma) in a musical way:

: Monks, there are five dangers of reciting the Dhamma with a musical intonation. What five? Oneself gets attached to the sound, others get attached to the sound, householders are annoyed, saying, &quot;Just as we sing, these sons of the Sakyan sing&quot;, the concentration of those who do not like the sound is destroyed, and later generations copy it. These, monks, are the five dangers of reciting the Dhamma with a musical intonation.
Meanwhile, in the &quot;Sigalovada Sutta&quot;, a sutta addressed to laypersons, music is included as a negative sense desire: There are these six drawbacks of frequenting festivals. You&#x27;re always thinking: &#x27;Where&#x27;s the dancing? Where&#x27;s the singing? Where&#x27;s the music? Where are the stories? Where&#x27;s the applause? Where are the kettledrums?&#x27;Early Buddhist sources include the practice of uposatha, in which laypersons observe a set of eight precepts. The seventh of these states one should abstain from wordly entertainments, shows and music. The &quot;Uposatha Sutta&quot; asks Buddhists to reflect how noble disciples &quot;have given up singing and dancing, the playing of musical instruments and the watching of entertainments, which are stumbling blocks to that which is wholesome.&quot;

The canonical Buddhist Vinayas (monastic codes) generally reject the use of musical chanting and singing for reciting the Buddhist scriptures, since it was seen as a sensuous distraction. They are prohibit monks and nuns from listening to or performing music since it is connected with sensual pleasure.

==== Positive passages ====
Certain passages in the early Buddhists are much more positive about music. Digha Nikaya sutta no. 21 (&quot;Sakka&#x27;s Questions&quot;) and its Chinese parallel at DA 14, contains a passage in which a gandharva (a celestial musician) named Pañcaśikha sings some verses to the Buddha accompanied by a lute, and the Buddha approves of it. In the Dirgha Agama version, the Buddha listens and praises Pañcaśikha saying: Good, Pañcaśikha, good! You&#x27;re able to praise the Tathāgata with your clear voice and harmonious cymophane lute. The sound of both your lute and voice are neither long or short. Their compassion and gracefulness moves people&#x27;s hearts. Your song is replete with many meanings and explains the bonds of desire, the religious life, the ascetic, and Nirvāṇa!The &quot;Mahaparinibbana sutta&quot; states that before the death of the Buddha, &quot;heavenly music played in the sky in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly choirs sang in the sky in honor of the Realized One.&quot; After the Buddha&#x27;s death, laypeople venerated the Buddha &quot;with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances&quot;. In the Chinese version of the &quot;Mahaparanirvana sutra&quot;, the Buddha approves of devotional practices through music when he states &quot;there are four kinds of people in the world who should be memorialized by building a shrine and providing incense, flowers, silk canopies, and music there&quot;. These four types of people are said to be: tathāgatas (Buddhas), pratyekabuddhas, sravakas (disciples) and noble wheel-turning kings.

The &quot;Mahāli Sutta&quot; (DN 6) mentions that through a certain samadhi, one may hear heavenly sounds from the deva realms.

Other sources, like the &quot;Jatakas&quot;, and &quot;Avadanas&quot;, contain various stories which depict music in a positive light. For example, in one story, a bird named Cittapatta sang songs to the past Buddha Vipassī, and he eventually gained a good rebirth and became a god, and then an arahant. Another story about a bird singing to a Buddha is found in the &quot;Theragāthā&quot; commentary (&quot;aṭṭhakathā&quot;), this time, the past Buddha Krakucchanda is featured. Similarly, when Sikhī Buddha died, a tree dwelling spirit offered flowers and instrumental music, and this contributed to his future nirvana (&quot;Therapadana&quot; 118).

=== In later sources ===
One Indian Buddhist figure who was well known as a musician was the 2nd century poet Aśvaghoṣa. Both Tibetan (Taranatha) and Chinese sources mention that he was also a great musician and traveled with a choir. Xuanzang (7th century) mentions that when he traveled to India, the music of Aśvaghoṣa was still remembered as having the power to impress upon people the truth of impermanence.

One of his musical hymns, the &quot;Gaṇḍīstotragāthā&quot; (Chinese: &quot;Kien-ch&#x27;ui-fan-tsan&quot;, &quot;Hymn on the Bell&quot;)&quot;,&quot; has survived in Chinese transliteration and Tibetan translation (which also include some musical notation). Musical references are also quite common in the &quot;Buddhacarita,&quot; which indicates the author was knowledgeable about Indian music, its styles, instruments, notes, and so forth.

According to the Theravada commentary to the &quot;Long Discourses,&quot; the &quot;Dīgha-nikāya-aṭṭhakathā&quot; (&quot;Sumaṅgalavilāsinī&quot;), king Aśoka&#x27;s consort Asandhimittā attained stream entry when she listened to a kalavīka bird&#x27;s song and imagined that it was the sweet voice of the Buddha (DA ii.453). One Theravada commentary on the &quot;Subhāsita Sutta&quot; (Sn 3.3) contains a story about sixty monks who attained arahantship in Sri Lanka after hearing a slave woman sing a song about birth, old age, and death. According to the Theravada commentator Buddhaghosa, adapting songs to the Dhamma is proper. His Vinaya Commentary also mentions certain &#x27;songs of sacred festivals&#x27; (sādhukīḷitagītaṃ) which sing of the qualities of the Three Jewels (Vinaya Commentary iv.925).

In the Theravada tradition, chanting of certain texts called parittas are considered to have the power to &quot;avert illness or danger, to ward off the influence of malignant beings, to obtain protection and deliverance from evil, and to promote health, prosperity, welfare, and well-being.&quot; There are several reasons that chanting these texts have power. Firstly, they are considered to be an &quot;act of truth&quot; (saccakiriya). According to this theory, words which speak of the truth of the Dharma are considered to have magical power. Furthermore, parittas are also connected with morality (sila) and kindness (metta) and the very sound of their chanting is said to calm the mind.

=== In Mahayana sources ===

Mahayana sutras often contain positive depictions of music, which is often seen as a wholesome offering with which to venerate the Buddhas which can generate merit and prompt the blessings of the Buddhas. In several Mahayana sutras, music is found as a common offering given by humans or devas to the Buddha. Examples can be found in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Lankavatara Sutra&quot;. In the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, music is found in various parts of the text as a common offering to the Buddha (along with other offerings such as flowers and incense). One example from chapter three states: Śakra, the lord of devas, and Brahma, together with innumerable deva-putras also made offerings to the Buddha of their heavenly beautiful garments, heavenly māndārava flowers, and great māndārava flowers. Their heavenly garments floated and fluttered in the air, while in the sky the devas played hundreds of thousands of myriads of kinds of music together at one time. Furthermore, &quot;Lotus sutra&quot; chapter two states:If someone employs persons to play music, striking drums or blowing horns or conch shells, playing pipes, flutes, zithers, harps, balloon guitars, cymbals and gongs, and if these many kinds of wonderful notes are intended wholly as an offering; or if one with a joyful mind sings a song in praise of the Buddha&#x27;s virtue, even if it is just one small note, then all who do these things have attained the Buddha way. Chapter twenty four of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; is named after a musical bodhisattva named Gadgadasvara (Wonderful Voice). This bodhisattva travels to our world and beautiful musical sounds follow him everywhere. The Buddha then explains that this bodhisattva &quot;paid homage to the Buddha Meghadundubhisvararāja with a hundred thousand kinds of music and eighty-four thousand seven-jeweled bowls&quot; for twelve thousand years. It is said that because of the roots of merit cultivated by this devotional practice, he attained rebirth in another Buddha&#x27;s pure land and gained transcendent powers. In later sources, the bodhisattva Wonderful Voice (Jp. Myōon) became identified with Saraswati / Benzaiten.

The &quot;Lankavatara sutra&quot; also contains examples of using music to praise and venerate the Buddha. In the first chapter, Ravana and his attendants first greet Shakyamuni Buddha by singing verses of praise which were &quot;gracefully accompanied by music, a lute studded with coral and cat&#x27;s eye, slung at the side by means of priceless perfumed pale cloth and played with a sapphire plectrum, producing a melody ranging through all the notes of the scale.&quot; The &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; also contains passages in which music is part of a set of devotional offerings for Buddhas and bodhisattvas. In one passage, a group of bodhisattvas is said to &quot;play heavenly music and praise the virtues of the buddhas with hymns accompanied by wonderful sounds&quot;.

Apart from presenting music as an offering to the Buddha, some Mahayana sources also depict music as a skillful means employed by the Buddhas to impart the Buddha Dharma in their pure lands. The &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; also describes the bodhisattva-devi Saraswati (Benzaiten) as a goddess of music whose voice can lead beings to salvation. According to Fabio Rambelli, &quot;here, Benzaiten&#x27;s voice is not an offering, but a tool to induce beings to accept Buddhism.&quot;

In the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;, the pure land of Buddha Amitabha (Sukhavati) is filled with magical music which arises from the Bodhi tree of Amitabha, from jeweled trees (&quot;ratnavṛkṣa&quot;) and from instruments that play by themselves. In the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha,&quot; Amitabha&#x27;s bodhi tree produces &quot;innumerable exquisite Dharma sounds&quot;, &quot;which spread far and wide, pervading all the other buddha lands in the ten directions&quot;. The sutra further states: Those who hear the sounds attain penetrating insight into dharmas and dwell in the stage of non-retrogression. Until they attain buddhahood, their senses of hearing will remain clear and sharp and they will not suffer from any pain or sickness... Again, in that land, there are thousands of varieties of spontaneous music, which are all, without exception, sounds of the Dharma. They are clear and serene, full of depth and resonance, delicate, and harmonious; they are the most excellent sounds in all the worlds of the ten directions. Furthermore, according to Rambelli, the sutra presents this divine music &quot;not only an adornment of the Pure Land, but a veritable manifestation of the Buddha Amida endowed with the power to lead beings to the Land of Bliss.&quot;

==== Philosophy of music in the &quot;Sutra of Kinnara King Druma&quot; ====

Perhaps the most detailed Mahayana philosophy of music is found in the &quot;Sutra of the Questions by Druma, King of the Kinnara&quot; (&quot;*Druma-kiṃnara-rāja-paripṛcchā&quot;), which was first translated by Lokakṣema (Taisho no. 624), and then again translated by Kumārajīva in the fifth century (Taisho no. 624).

Various passages in the sutra describe numerous performances of heavenly music, most of them performed by King Druma, the vīnā playing king of the kinnaras (Skt. Kiṃnara), and his retinue of musicians (which include devas, kinnaras and gandharvas). In some passages, the Buddha himself preaches through song. Druma&#x27;s music is presented as so powerful that it can be heard all over the universe, it drives all the devas in the desire realm to come see the Buddha and makes all those present (except a few high level bodhisattvas), start dancing spontaneously.

Druma also plays a song about emptiness which leads eight thousand bodhisattvas to attain the patience of the non-arising of all dharmas. When asked where this beautiful song came from, Druma explains his philosophy of music, which is encapsulated in the following passage:All sounds emerge from empty space. Sound has the nature of emptiness: when you finish hearing it, it disappears; after it disappears, it abides in emptiness. Therefore, all dharmas, whether they are taught or not, are emptiness. All dharmas are like sound. If one teaches the dharmas through sound, the dharmas cannot be attained in sound itself. Dharmas themselves cannot be said; what is called speech is only sound. Therefore, sound is originally non-abiding anywhere [i.e., is non-substantial], thus it is not real and solid, and its reality only lies in its name. If so, and paradoxically, its reality is indestructible , has no origin and thus is not subject to extinction, therefore it is pure, immaculate, and incorruptible, like light and the mind; it is all-surpassing and beyond signs – that is, sound is the condition of enlightenment; when a bodhisattva is in that condition, he has attained the endurance of the non-origination of dharmas […] All discourses are only sound/voice; one produces these sounds simply because one wants to talk about something else than voice. This endurance of the non-origination of dharmas cannot be explained nor heard. Why? Because its meaning is unattainable, that is, absent. 
According to Rambelli, the gist of this passage is that all Buddhist sutras, teachings and also music &quot;are simply voiced sounds or signifiers; their signifieds are not inherent in those sounds and are nowhere to be found (they are unattainable)...In more technical terms, music, like language, is not a symbol of anything (meaning is ontologically distinct and separate from sound); rather, music is both an index and an icon (a faithful reproduction) of emptiness – in other words, music is a concrete example, in our experiential field, of emptiness.&quot; Rambelli also notes that Druma&#x27;s instrument, the veena, is made of beryl (vaiḍūrya), which is a transparent light green stone. Transparency is also a metaphor for emptiness in Indian sources. Hence, Druma is singing about emptiness with an instrument that also symbolizes emptiness.

The Buddha confirms that Druma is highly advanced in his use of music as a skillful means and that through music he can lead countless beings to omniscience. At another part of the sutra, the Buddha manifests seven giant trees which emit light and music all over the universe and then himself produces a song accompanied by music which clarifies all the doubts of the bodhisattvas. The Buddha also explains to the kinnaras that they do not need to abandon their musical arts to practice the path, because their musical sounds protect the Dharma.

According to Rambelli, this sutra was influential in Japanese Buddhism, where it was used to defend the activities of Buddhist musicians and performing artists not just as an offering, but as a kind of self-cultivation.

=== In Vajrayana Buddhism ===

The Indian Buddhist tantric literature includes music, song and dance as common ritual offerings to tantric deities.

The use of singing and dancing as a spiritual practice is promoted in various Buddhist tantras, for example, singing and dancing is an important practice in the &quot;Hevajra Tantra&quot;, which states:If songs are sung from bliss, they are supreme vajra-songs. When bliss arises, dance for the sake of liberation, dancing the adamantine postures with full awareness...The songs are mantra and the dance is meditation; therefore a practitioner of yoga must ever always sing and dance.The &quot;Hevajra Tantra&quot; further states that this is to be performed &quot;with mindfulness, distracted, meditating with impassioned mind, in a state of unwavering awareness.&quot; Similarly, the &quot;Sarvabuddhasamāyoga Tantra&quot; (&quot;Union of all the Buddhas Tantra&quot;) states:The excellent song of the manifestations of the Buddha, for those knowing these mudras, is the excellent cause of perfection, accomplishes all the esoteric acts, continually brings all the physical necessities, and thus all the forms of increase of goods. So, having sun the songs with six varieties of tunes, sing the divinity&#x27;s song. An inscription from Gaya also shows that during the Tantric age, sophisticated styles of song and dance offerings were made in Buddhist temples with the support of Indian royalty.

Indian Buddhist mahasiddhas and yogis were known to sing tantric songs, variously called &quot;Dohā&quot;, &quot;Vajragīti&quot;, and &quot;Caryāgīti.&quot; Indian Vajrayana sources state that these songs, along with music and dance, were part of tantric Buddhist feasts (ganachakras, esoteric gatherings and celebrations). These Carya songs contained esoteric instructions on the Vajrayana Buddhist view and practice. Many esoteric references were communicated through coded language. Many of these songs survive in Tibetan translation. One collection by Viraprakasa has songs from the eighty four mahasiddhas, and is known as &quot;Vajra Songs: The Heart Realizations of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas.&quot; A similar genre of tantric Buddhist songs have survived in the proto-Bengali–Assamese Charyapadas.

One famous tantric Buddhist musician was the Mahāsiddha Vīṇāpa (the vina player), one of the 84 mahasiddhas. He was known for using the playing of the vina as a form of spiritual practice (sadhana). According to the Buddhist sources, his guru Buddhapa taught Vinapa to meditate as follows: &quot;meditate upon the sound of your instrument free of all distinction between the sound struck and the mental impression; cease all mental interference with the sound, all conceptualization and all critical and judgemental thought, so that you contemplate only pure sound.&quot; After practicing this method for nine years, Vinapa is said to have attained the realization of Mahamudra. In one song by Vinapa, he says &quot;practicing the unborn, unstruck sound, I, Vinapa, lost my self.&quot;

Tibetan Buddhists also composed their own prayers and &quot;vajra songs&quot; as well as developing new musical forms, like Tibetan overtone singing (&quot;throat singing&quot;). Some Tibetan Buddhist traditions, like the Chod tradition of Machik Labdrön (1055–1153), still include the singing of songs with instrumental accompaniment as part of their ritual practices. One contemporary figure known for his yogic songs is Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso. According to Ari Goldfield and Rose Taylor, Singing Dharma songs is an extraodinarily skillful and enjoyable Buddhist practice technique that Rinpoche has introduced to his students in a variety of ways: Rinpoche himself sings regularly; he has given illuminating explanations of the profound songs of the great masters; has composed many of his own songs; and has instructed and encouraged students to translate these songs into their own languages and sing them in their own national and cultural melodies. 

=== In East Asian Buddhism ===

Buddhist music is a central feature of East Asian Buddhism, where it is seen as an important offering to the Buddhas, as a skillful means of teaching Buddhism and also as a kind of meditation.

In his &quot;Nanhai Ji Gui Zhuan&quot; (Commentaries on Dharma from the South Sea), the Chinese Tang dynasty monk Yi Jing (635-713) presented six merits of Buddhist chanting: &quot;1) understanding Buddha&#x27;s great virtue better; 2) becoming well versed in Buddhist sutras; 3) purifying organ of speech; 4) improving the thoracic cavity; 5) inducing calm and confidence in the multitude; and 6) longevity.&quot;

Heng Sure writes that &quot;Buddhist music, like all things Buddhist, aims to nurture both wisdom and blessings&quot;...&quot;when music is used to praise the Triple Jewel and the Bodhisattvas, it creates blessings and merit.&quot; He also argues that Buddhist musical chanting (as opposed to mundane music which is often about sensuality and courtship) can aid one in developing the meditative quality of samadhi. Because of this, Buddhist music is seen as exempt from the precept that states monks and nuns must avoid music. Furthermore, Heng Sure also writes that &quot;we can use music to praise the Triple Jewel and the Bodhisattvas; we use it to teach principle, to gather in and harmonize the conscious awareness of an audience, to accompany sutra text, to restate sutra text in verse. In the end as in the beginning, music is magic. Whether one can use it or not depends on your samadhi.&quot;

Heng Sure also cites the &quot;Shurangama Sutra&quot; which states that listening to sounds with the ear is the most effective method for awakening, since &quot;the substance of the teaching resides purely in sound.&quot; Thus, also sounds are part of the mundane world, &quot;hearing them clearly and discriminating them accurately remains our best avenue for awakening here in the world. Someone on the Bodhisattva Path stays within the world, and by letting go the habit of loving or hating sounds, cultivates stillness right within the movement of the busy marketplace.&quot;

According to John Daido Loori, the Japanese Zen master Dōgen also defended chanting and Zen liturgy as an important practice. According to Dōgen, the sounds and words of the sutras are metaphors which point to the ultimate, but they are also non-dual with ultimate reality itself. The &quot;Shobogenzo&quot; states, &quot;seeing forms with the whole body-and-mind, hearing sounds with the whole body-and-mind, one understands them intimately&quot;. As such, if we practice Buddhist liturgy by chanting and listening with one&#x27;s &quot;whole body-and-mind&quot;, one eliminates the space between the self and the chants. In this way, developing an intimate practice of chanting can be a skillful means to allow the practitioner to transcend all conceptions of self and other and to experience the non-dual ultimate truth.

==Types of Buddhist music==
Most forms of Buddhist music is vocal music and religious chanting, often accompanied by musical instruments. A Buddhist chant is a form of musical verse or recitation, in some ways analogous to the religious musics and hymns of other faiths.

There are numerous traditions of Buddhist chanting, singing, and music in all three major schools of Buddhism: Theravada, East Asian Buddhism, and Himalayan Vajrayana.

The basis for most Theravada chants is the Pali Canon, though there are traditions which use more recent compositions. The Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions draw from a wider range of sources, like the Mahayana texts, the Buddhist tantric literature and other sources.

=== East Asian Buddhism ===
East Asian Buddhist music is known as &quot;fanbai&quot; in Chinese and includes numerous genres. Ancient Chinese musical theory held that good music brought harmony to the world and Confucian thinking held that music was useful for self cultivation. In Chinese Buddhism, these positive views of music combined with the Mahayana Buddhist views of music as a meritorious offering and a skillful means.

According to Trân Van Khê, East Asian Buddhist music is mainly ritualistic vocal music, mostly the chanting of traditional dharanis and sutras like the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot;, &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, or the &quot;Amitabha sutras&quot;. However, instrumental music is sometimes heard during special ceremonies, such as funerals. Rituals in which Buddhist music may be heard include repentance ceremonies and rites like the Liberation Rite of Water and Land.

Instruments which are found in East Asian Buddhist music include: biwa, oboe (ken), transverse flute (sao), mouth organ, ceremonial drums (like the taiko, or the Vietnamese trong nhac), gongs, bells, erhu, yangqin, the Vietnamese bow lute, and the tap pyong so (Korean).

=== Chinese Buddhist music ===


The first Chinese Buddhist music appeared in the Three Kingdoms period and consisted of sutra recitation (zhuandu) and Buddhist chants (&quot;fanbai&quot;) which drew on Buddhist stories from the scriptures and were set to Chinese music. The first well known figure to promote Buddhist music in China was the translator Zhi Qian, who complied &quot;Sung Chants for Sakra Accompanied by Qin Music&quot; (&quot;Dishi yuerenban zheqin gebai&quot;). Most of this early Buddhist music were solemn chants and had no instrumental accompaniment.

Buddhist music was developed and promoted by Emperor Wu of Liang, who himself composed pieces of Buddhist music, introduced the genre to his court and promoted large scale Dharma assemblies which included music and chanting. During the Six Dynasties period, Buddhist music flourished. &quot;The Tale of the Luoyang Temple&quot; describes the Jingle Temple at Luoyang thus: &quot;even in the six cloisters, female musicians were installed. Their singing echoed around the rafters. The sleeves of the dancers gently fluttered. The music of zithers and flutes resounded loud and clear, enchanting the hearers. When the temple&#x27;s thousand images of Buddha were paraded through the streets clouds of incense hung like a dense fog, the sacred music shook Heaven and Earth, the players ranced and danced, all was a festival.&quot;

Buddhist music rose to further prominence in Buddhist temples during the Sui and Tang dynasties when it became widely influential on Chinese culture. This flowering of Buddhist music led to the development of new genres like shuochang storytelling and bianwen storytelling.

There were three main forms of Tang Buddhist music: hymns recited in temples for ritual services, proselytizing music used in popular preaching to laypeople (&quot;sujiang&quot;) and popular Buddhist songs (&quot;foqu&quot;) used in celebrations and temple activities.

Popular forms of Buddhist music were influenced by Central Asian music of the Western regions and also drew on local Chinese folk and popular music traditions. Buddhist music played a key role in Chinese Buddhist efforts to proselytize to laypersons. Popular preaching (&quot;sujiang&quot;) drew on local folk culture, stories, and music and this genre became very popular among the masses. Soon specialized venues called bianchang developed as well as troupes of performers (yinsheng) who specialized in popular Buddhist music. Temples often had their own yinsheng groups and even the imperial court had their own groups of Buddhist musicians. These court Buddhist musicians famously took part in a very large ceremony during the funeral of Xuanzang.

Popular Tang Buddhist songs (&quot;foqu&quot;) which were used for worship and for large celebrations are recorded in various sources including &quot;Record of the Jiegu&quot;, the &quot;Tang Huiyao&quot; and Cheng Yang&#x27;s &quot;Yue-shu&quot; and include titles such as &quot;Maitreya Foqu&quot; (Mile Foqu), &quot;Suryaprabha Foqu&quot; (Riguang Foqu) and &quot;Tathagata Foqu&quot; (Rulai Foqu). These songs remained influential into the Song dynasty period.

Buddhist music and chants remain an important part of the practice of contemporary Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. The American Buddhist monk Heng Sure describes the contemporary practice of chanting in Chinese Buddhist monasteries as follows:Buddhist monasteries are musical environments. These new monks and nuns in the Mahayana tradition would on that day and every day, spend a minimum of two and a half hours in the Buddha Hall chanting, and on holidays or sessions, the ceremonies can last for twelve hours, sometimes for twenty-one days. The regular liturgical chanting starts at 4:00 AM with half an hour of mantras and Dharanis, then includes chanting of sutras, praises, Buddha&#x27;s names, invocations, repentances, dedications, blessings, and protection verses. The tunes and music modes are in some cases 1400 years old. They are healing, and when sung with a sincere heart, have the power to bring the mind to single-pointed clarity and stillness. 

=== Korean Buddhist music ===
Korean Buddhist musical chanting is called pomp&#x27;ae (Beompae). There are two main styles chissori (grand elaborated style) and the hossori (simple style). The chanted text may be in Chinese, Sanskrit or in Korean, depending on the style.

Korean musical chanting which is accompanied by dance is called chak pop. There are three types: na bi ch&#x27;um, the dance of the butterflies; para ch&#x27;um, the dance of the cymbals; and pop go ch&#x27;um, the ceremonial drum dance.

Furthermore, some forms of instrumental music are inspired by Buddhism, including the famous Yongsan hoe sang.

=== Japanese traditions ===

Japanese Buddhism includes various traditions of chanting, sutra recitation (dokyō) and Buddhist music. The vocal element is generally the most important element of Japanese Buddhist music. Chanting of the names of the Buddha (especially popular is the nembutsu), and of specific sutras (such as parts of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;) is a central practice in various traditions of Japanese Buddhism. This may be accompanied by drumming, standing bells, or other instruments. Each school of Japanese Buddhism has its own style of chanting and musical instrumentation which is used in different rituals and annual observations. 

One important tradition of Japanese Buddhist choral music is Shomyo (声明, lit. &quot;bright voice&quot;), which dates from the 12th century. This is a monophonal musical style performed by Buddhist monks which is especially important in the Tendai, Obaku, and Shingon sects. Shomyo was influenced by Chinese Buddhist chanting which was introduced to Japan in the 8th century. Shomyo is most often a melismatic singing unaccompanied by instrumentation, though sometimes percussion instruments (drums, clappers, gongs, bells or cymbals) may be used. One of the first performances of shomyo was in 752, when hundreds of monks at Todaiji performed hymns like &quot;Praise of the Tathagata&quot; (Nyoraibai), &quot;Falling Flowers&quot; (Sange), &quot;Sanskrit Sound&quot; (Bonnon), and &quot;Sounding Staff&quot; (Shakujo). One important classic collection of Shomyo chants is the &quot;Gyosan Shomyo Rok hanjo,&quot; compiled by Kekan (a disciple of Ryōnin) in 1173. It includes chants in Sanskrit, Chinese and Japanese, and it remains a major source of chants for the Tendai school.

A rarer tradition of shomyo is performed by a solitary monk accompanied by a biwa (the Japanese short necked lute). There are two main styles of Shomyo: ryokyoku and rikkyoku, described as difficult and easy to remember, respectively.

Another genre of Japanese Buddhist music is , a kind of ritual narrative music which originated in the Tendai school and spread to other Buddhist traditions, such as Zen Buddhism. Eventually all Japanese Buddhist schools had kōshiki repertoires. Japanese chanted poetry is also another form of Buddhist music found in Japan. Other forms include &quot;hyobyaku&quot; (pronouncement of intention), &quot;saimon&quot; (offertory declaration), and &quot;wasan&quot; (Japanese Hymns).

The Meiji period (1868–1912) saw much innovation in Japanese Buddhist music. Japanese Buddhists modernized many of their music, often borrowing from Western musical styles. Traditional styles like shomyo were still preserved however and are still heard in Japanese Buddhist temples today. In the 2000s, Japanese clergy also began to adopt traditional Buddhist texts to modern musical genres like rock and pop music. Modern technology like vocaloids, robots, and keyboards have also been used to promote Buddhist chanting and many of these new musical compositions have spread through the internet. 

==== Honkyoku ====
Honkyoku (本曲) are the pieces of shakuhachi or hocchiku music originally played by wandering Japanese Zen monks called Komuso. Komuso temples were abolished in 1871, but their honkyoku music remains popular in modern Japan. Komuso played honkyoku as a meditative practice and for alms as early as the 13th century. In the 18th century, a Komuso named Kinko Kurosawa of the Zen Fuke sect was commissioned to travel throughout Japan and collect these musical pieces. The results of several years of travel and compilation were thirty-six pieces known as the &quot;Kinko-Ryu Honkyoku.&quot;

=== Nepalese Buddhism ===
The music of Nepalese Buddhism reflects native Nepalese, Tibetan and Indian musical traditions. Newar Buddhism includes a rich musical tradition which has been subject to numerous ethnographic studies. Newar musical genres include dhāpā, cācā, and bājans. Dāphā is the oldest surviving devotional musical genre of Nepal, having originated in the 17th century. It is an important role of many Newar men to practice with a local musical group. 

Bhajans (bājans) are popular among both Buddhists and Hindus in Nepal, and they are performed by amateurs as well as by trained musicians. These are three main types of Buddhist bājans found in Nepalese Buddhism: mu dhimay bājans, gumlā bājans and gyānmālā bājans. Dhimay Bājan is a popular form performed by Newar farmers, who often worship both Buddhist and Hindu deities. It is performed by one or more drummers using an oversized drum (dhimay). 

Gunlā Bājan is another popular genre which is commonly found during various religious processions and during the holy month of Gumlā. It is commonly practiced by groups who meet at the Svayambhū stūpa hill and circumambulate the stūpa, also visiting other sites in town. The ensembles use the small nāykhī and the larger dhā drums as well as cymbals, and woodwinds and brass instruments are also sometimes added. 

The most recent style is a modern bhajan style called gyānmālā bājan which Newar Buddhists adopted from modern Indian bhajans. This style uses the Indian harmonium and tabla, and sometimes other less traditional instruments like keyboards or guitars. The Gyānmālā Bhajan society is one popular Buddhist group which is influential in the development of this modern Newari language tradition. In the 20th century, numerous Newari Buddhist authors composed new bhajans in Newari, some of them focus on teaching the Dharma, and others have a more devotional Indian bhakti style. 

=== Bengali Buddhism ===

The earliest known Bengali songs are the Buddhist Charyapadas (Songs of realization, c. 900–1100 CE) of the medieval tantric mystics.

The Baul tradition, while not a Buddhist tradition per se, still makes use of some of the Bengali Buddhist Sahaja tradition&#x27;s Carya songs.

The devotional Buddhist music of Bengali Buddhists is often called &quot;Buddha-samkirtan&quot; or &quot;Buddha kirtan.&quot; It is a common practice among the Barua Buddhists of Bangladesh.

===Himalayan and Tibetan Buddhist music===


The Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition (found in Tibet, Bhutan, some north Indian states, and in the Tibetan diaspora) includes numerous musical elements, and vocal chanting accompanied by various instruments is a central feature of Himalayan Buddhism. The main distinction is between the musical traditions practiced by monastics in Buddhist monasteries and the musical traditions practiced by laypersons.

The singing of popular songs (mostly called &quot;glu&quot;) by Buddhist laypersons of the Himalayan regions is widespread. Most are secular, but &quot;chos-glu&quot; (dharma songs) are also sung. Sometimes this may be accompanied by a few instruments like the dra-nyen lute, the chiwang fiddle; and the duct flute (gling-bu). The term &quot;mgur&quot; meanwhile, refers specifically to devotional Buddhist songs, which have been traditionally used to teach Buddhism.

One of the most famous songwriter of these was the great yogi Milarepa, and his &quot;Hundred Thousand Songs&quot; remains popular today. Another influential Tibetan songwriter and musician was Gotsangpa Gonpo Dorje (1189–1258). He was originally a travelling performance artist, a &quot;pakshi,&quot; who became an influential lama and founded the Upper Druk (stod &#x27;brug) lineage of the Drukpa Kagyu school.

There are also other traditions of musicians, including mendicant musicians, and epic storytellers (Sgrung-mkhan, who often focus on the Epic of King Gesar) and the Manipa (who sing mgur and mantras, including the famous Mani mantra).

Musical chanting, most often in Tibetan, is an integral part of Tibetan Buddhism. These chants may be simple or complex recitations of sacred texts for various occasions. Chanting accompanied by a melody (dbyangs) is often used as part of Tibetan Buddhist rituals, ceremonies, festivals, and sadhanas. Instruments like small hand drums (damaru), hand bells, and trumpets are often used in certain tantric practices. Musical instruments used in Tibetan Buddhist music include horns, cymbals, rgya-gling (oboe), gandi (wooden gong), dung dkar (conch trumpet), Mongolian yat-ga (Mongolian zither) and dra-nyen (lute).

Individual schools, and even individual monasteries, maintain their own chant traditions. Tibetan Buddhism developed its own musical notation system and manuscripts depicting this system have survived in use until the present day.

Tibetan monks are also noted for their skill at throat-singing or overtone singing. This is a specialized form of singing in which the singer can sound like he is producing separate notes simultaneously. The Cham dance is another Tibetan Buddhist performance art that includes music.

=== Music in Theravada Buddhism ===

In the Theravada tradition, chanting is usually done in Pali, sometimes with vernacular translations interspersed. The intonation and style of the chant varies by tradition, with some preferring a more monotone chant and others a more melodic chanting. A common type of chanting in Theravada is pirit (paritta, &quot;protection&quot;) chanting, which is one of the oldest forms of Buddhist chanting. Among the most popular Theravada paritta chants are: Tisarana (The Three Refuges), Pancasila (The Five Precepts), Upajjhatthana (The Five Remembrances), Metta Sutta (Discourse on Loving Kindness), and Mangala Sutta (Discourse on Blessings).

Sinhalese Theravada Buddhism has various musical traditions. Some Theravada communities practice a type of religious service called &quot;poya hewisi&quot; which is accompanied by drumming. The Tooth Relic Temple is the site of one popular tradition of devotional music which make extensive use of drumming. This tradition can be traced back to the 18th century when several new musical forms arose, including prashasti (&#x27;praise songs&#x27;).

There are also modern traditions of lay Buddhist instrumental ensembles called hevisi which make musical offerings (shabda puja) at Buddhist temples. Music (as well as dance and theater) is a central part of Sinhalese temple processions (perahera), such as the popular Kandy Esala Perahera.

Outside of Sri Lanka, one musical form of traditional Buddhist chanting found in Cambodian Buddhism is called Smot.

==== Myanmar ====

Myanmar is home to a broad genre of contemporary Buddhist music called &quot;dhamma thachin&quot; (ဓမ္မသီချင်း) or &quot;dhamma tay&quot; (ဓမ္မတေး, ), composed in the twentieth to twenty-first centuries. These songs draw on religious themes, and are commonly broadcast in Buddhist monasteries, and during religious festivals and donation feasts.

Popular recording artists of this genre include Soe Sandar Tun and Mandalay Thein Zaw. From a lyrical perspective, this genre can be subdivided into songs that extol the Buddha and Buddhism, and songs that exhort listeners to follow Buddhist teachings. Some compositions use traditional Burmese instruments and vocal stylings associated with the Mahāgīta, a genre of Burmese classical music.

=== Western Buddhism ===
Some contemporary Western Buddhists have adopted the various chanting and musical traditions from Asian Buddhism. Some Western Buddhists also sing about Buddhism in Western Buddhist genres, like punk, metal or folk.

Examples of Western Buddhist musicians who perform Buddhist music include Tina Turner, who has released music based on Japanese Nichiren Buddhist chanting, Lee Mirabai Harrington, who sings &quot;Buddhist kirtan&quot; influenced by Indian kirtan styles, the Buddhist monk Heng Sure, who has released several albums of &quot;American Buddhist Folk Songs&quot; and the punk band The Deathless.

=== Contemporary music genres ===
There are also several contemporary musicians which have been labeled &quot;Buddhist music&quot; and who make use of modern musical technology. They include popular singers like the Chinese-Malaysian Imee Ooi, the Tibetan singer Dechen Shak-Dagsay, the Japanese priest Kanho Yakushiji, and the Nepalese singer Ani Choying Drolma.

Some contemporary Buddhists have adopted specific styles like Hip hop (MC Happiness), and Metal (The Firstborn).

== Influence outside of Buddhism ==
There are also a number of New Age and experimental musical forms which are related to or draw on Buddhism, some with understanding of the words, others merely based on repetition. A large number of these schools tend to be syncretic and incorporate Buddhist influences along with music of other traditions, like Hinduism. The first &quot;New Age music&quot; album, Music for Zen Meditation, draws on Buddhist themes.

While not strictly a variation of Buddhist chanting in itself, Japanese is a form of chanted poetry that reflects several principles of Zen Buddhism. It is sung in the &quot;seiza&quot; position, and participants are encouraged to sing from the gut - the Zen locus of power. &quot;Shigin&quot; and related practices are often sung at Buddhist ceremonies and quasi-religious gatherings in Japan.

In 2009, the Beyond Singing Project produced an album combining Buddhist chants and Christian choral music. Tina Turner and Dechen Shak-Dagsay were involved.

Dutch gothic-symphonic metal band Epica are also incorporating and combining Tibetan monk prayer chants as background openings in 2009&#x27;s Design Your Universe,2014&#x27;s The Quantum Enigma,and 2021&#x27;s Omega.

<text>Ten High is a brand of American whiskey first introduced in the 1930s by Hiram Walker &amp; Sons, now produced by the Barton Brands division of the Sazerac Company. The name &quot;Ten High&quot; refers to a barrel storage location at least ten ricks high, as barrels in the upper part of the aging warehouse mature faster. Although the brand name evoked this storage method, the manufacturer did not actually promise that the brand was from barrels aged in such locations.

==History==
The brand was originally produced by Hiram Walker &amp; Sons (a company owned by Harry C. Hatch at the time) at a distillery in Peoria, Illinois, starting shortly after the end of Prohibition in 1933. It was a major brand (and the leading brand of Illinois-made bourbon) until the late 1960s when the American whiskey market went through a particularly difficult period. The Peoria distillery stopped distilling operations in 1973 and closed completely in 1981. After the Peoria distillery closed, production moved first to Heaven Hill and later to Barton, both based in Bardstown, Kentucky. The Sazerac Company acquired Barton, including the Ten High brand, in 2009.

From the early 1980s until the late 2000s, Ten High was a straight Bourbon whiskey. Starting in 2009, the brand switched to being labelled &quot;Bourbon – a blend&quot;, a designation for a product that is 51 percent straight Bourbon, with the remainder neutral spirits.

<text>Oxycodone/paracetamol, sold under the brand name Percocet among others, is a fixed-dose combination of the opioid oxycodone with paracetamol (acetaminophen), used to treat moderate to severe pain.

In 2022, it was the 98th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions.

==History==
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved oxycodone/paracetamol in 1976, under application ANDA 085106.

== Society and culture ==
=== Implicated in deaths ===
In June 2009, an FDA advisory panel recommended that Percocet, Vicodin, and every other combination of acetaminophen with narcotic analgesics be limited in their sales because of their contributions to an alleged 400 acetaminophen-related deaths in the U.S. each year, that were attributed to acetaminophen overdose and associated liver damage.

In December 2009, a study found a fivefold increase in oxycodone-related deaths in Ontario, Canada (mostly accidental) between 1991 and 2007 that led to a doubling of all opioid-related deaths in Ontario over the same period.

<text>Anatoly Timofeevich Fomenko (; born 13 March 1945 in Stalino, USSR, now the city of Donetsk) is a Soviet and Russian professor of Mathematics at Moscow State University. He is well-known as a topologist and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He is a painter and illustrator of original artworks inspired by topological objects and structures.

Fomenko is also widely known as a conspiracy theorist. He originated a fictitious and pseudoscientific history called New Chronology, based on works of Russian-Soviet writer Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov.

==Biography==
Fomenko is the son of Timothy Grigorievich Fomenko (Russian: Тимофей Григорьевич Фоме́нко), an industrial engineer, and Valentina Polikarpovna (née Markova) (Russian: Валентина Поликарповна Маркова), a philologist and teacher of Russian language and literature. His parents would later co-author his works on New Chronology in 1983 and 1996. Born in what is now Donetsk, he was raised and schooled in Magadan. In 1959, his family returned to Eastern Ukraine and settled in the city of Luhansk, where Fomenko attended Secondary School No. 26. During secondary school, Fomenko participated in many competitions relating to mathematics and won several medals as a result. Also in 1959, the magazine &quot;Pionerskaya Pravda&quot; (Russian: Пионерская правда, &quot;Pioneer Truth&quot;) published his first known science fiction story, &quot;The Mystery of the Milky Way&quot;.

Fomenko graduated from the Mechanics and Mathematics Department of Moscow State University in 1967. In 1969, he began studying differential geometry in the same department. In 1970, he defended his thesis &quot;Classification of totally geodesic manifolds realizing nontrivial cycles in Riemannian homogeneous spaces&quot;, and in 1972 defended his doctoral thesis, &quot;The decision of the multidimensional plateau problems on Riemannian manifolds.&quot; In December 1981, he became a professor of Higher Geometry and Topology, and in 1992, was appointed as head of Differential Geometry and Applications in the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics at Moscow State University 

==Mathematical work==
Fomenko developed the theory of topological invariants of an integrable Hamiltonian system. He is the author of 180 scientific publications and 26 textbooks (including monographs) on mathematics. Fomenko is a specialist in geometry and topology, variational calculus, symplectic topology, Hamiltonian geometry and mechanics, and computational geometry. 

Fomenko has served as the editor of several Russian-language mathematics journals and is a member of many councils overseeing dissertations in his field. In 1996, he won the State Prize of the Russian Federation for excellence in mathematics. He is a full member (Academician) of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1994), the International Higher Education Academy of Sciences (1993), and the Russian Academy of Technological Sciences (2009). He is also a member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (1991).

Fomenko is the author of extensive writings in his original fields of mathematics, and is also known for his original drawings inspired by topological objects and structures.

==Historical revisionism==
Fomenko is one of the authors of a concept that manipulates historical chronology called New Chronology. Fomenko claims that he has discovered new empirico-statistical methods and their application to determine that many historical events do not correspond with the dates on which they are supposed to have occurred. He asserts from this that all of ancient history (including the history of Greece, Rome, and Egypt) is merely a reflection of events that occurred in the Middle Ages, and that all of Chinese and Arab history are fabrications of 17th- and 18th-century Jesuits. Fomenko is the author and sometimes co-author of several books the analysis of historical chronicles as well as the chronology of antiquity and the Middle Ages.

He also claims that Jesus lived in the 12th century A.D. and was crucified on Joshua&#x27;s Hill; that the Trojan War and the Crusades were the same historical event; and that Genghis Khan and the Mongols were actually Russians, that the lands west of the Thirteen Colonies that now constitute the American West and Middle West were a far eastern part of &quot;Siberian-American Empire&quot; prior to its disintegration in 1775, and many other claims that contradict conventional historiography. As well as disputing written chronologies, Fomenko also disputes scientific dating techniques such as dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating . His books include &quot;Empirico-statistical Analysis of Narrative Material and Its Applications&quot;, and &quot;History: Fiction or Science?&quot;.

Most Russian scientists and worldwide historians consider Fomenko&#x27;s historical works to be either pseudoscientific or antiscientific.

<doc id="649517" wikidata="Q7721796" url="?curid=649517" title="The Cay">
<text>The Cay is a teen novel written by Theodore Taylor. It was published in 1969.

Taylor took only three weeks to write &quot;The Cay&quot;, having contemplated the story for over a decade after reading about an 11-year-old who was aboard the Dutch ship &quot;Hato&quot; when it was torpedoed in 1942, and who was last seen by other stranded survivors as he drifted away on a life raft. The novel was published in 1969 and dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr.

==Plot==
During the outbreak of World War II, 11-year-old Phillip Enright and his mother decide to leave Curaçao for Virginia, aboard the S.S. &quot;Hato&quot;. This decision is driven by Phillip&#x27;s mother&#x27;s concern over the increasing danger posed by German submarines surrounding Curaçao. Tragically, the ship is torpedoed, resulting in Phillip becoming stranded at sea with an elderly black man named Timothy and a cat named Stew Cat.

While adrift, Phillip loses his sight, a condition Timothy attributes to Phillip staring at the sun too long. Eventually, they find a small island in a region known as Devil&#x27;s Mouth. On this cay, which measured only one mile in length and half a mile in width, they build a hut and mark the passage of days by placing pebbles in a can. With limited supplies, they survive for two months by fishing and collecting rainwater. Despite initial communication barriers due to their different backgrounds, Phillip and Timothy develop a deep friendship. Timothy cares for Phillip and teaches him essential survival skills, enabling Phillip to become self-sufficient.

Although airplanes fly over the cay, they fail to spot Phillip and Timothy, prolonging their ordeal. A devastating hurricane later strikes, destroying their shelter. Timothy protects Phillip by tying them both to a palm tree, but he succumbs to exposure. Phillip, heartbroken, buries Timothy and is eventually rescued by a navy vessel. After their rescue, Phillip undergoes multiple surgeries to restore his sight, which had been lost due to nerve damage caused by a head injury from falling timber during the shipwreck. Inspired by his experience, Phillip aspires to become a sea explorer and hopes to one day locate the cay where he and Timothy had been stranded, confident he could identify it even with his eyes closed.

==Characters==

Phillip Enright: An 11-year-old boy who becomes marooned on a cay with Timothy. Initially prejudiced against Timothy due to his race, Phillip grows to appreciate and rely on him, forming a strong bond.

Timothy: A West Indian native from Charlotte Amalie in Saint Thomas. He is stranded with Phillip and uses his extensive survival knowledge to care for and teach Phillip to be self-sufficient. Despite his superstitions, Timothy proves to be wise and patient.

Stew Cat: The cat who accompanies Phillip and Timothy as a fellow castaway, initially belonging to a cook on the S.S. &quot;Hato&quot;.

Grace Enright: Phillip&#x27;s mother, accompanies Phillip on the S.S. &quot;Hato&quot; headed for Virginia, gets separated from him when it sinks. She Is visibly uncomfortable in Curaçao due to her racial prejudices against the local population

Phillip Enright Sr.: Phillip&#x27;s father, who relocates the family to the Dutch West Indies for government-related work. He works in an oil refinery that increases the production of aviation gas.

Henrik van Boven: Phillip&#x27;s Dutch friend in Curaçao, who is puzzled by Grace&#x27;s racial prejudices.

==Racism==

In &quot;The Cay,&quot; the theme of racial prejudice is explored through the character of Grace, Phillip&#x27;s mother. She expresses a longing for her home in Virginia and discomfort living in Curaçao due to her prejudices against the predominantly Black bay workers in the area Grace&#x27;s discomfort and biases lead her to instruct her son, Phillip, and his friend Henrik to avoid the bay area, a directive that Henrik finds puzzling and unusual. Once Phillip is a castaway, he begins to adopt his mother&#x27;s prejudice tendencies and direct it towards Timothy.

As the story progresses, Phillip, influenced by his mother&#x27;s attitudes, begins to adopt similar prejudices, initially directed towards Timothy, the elderly Black man with whom Phillip becomes stranded. However, Phillip&#x27;s views begin to change as he spends more time with Timothy and recognizes their shared humanity. A pivotal moment occurs when Timothy reveals his origins from Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas. Phillip, surprised, responds by noting that this makes Timothy an American, referencing the American purchase of the Virgin Islands from Denmark as a result of the Treaty of the Danish West Indies.. Timothy&#x27;s casual indifference to this fact contrasts with Phillip&#x27;s initial curiosity about Timothy&#x27;s background, highlighting Phillip&#x27;s growing awareness and questioning of his preconceived notions.

Phillip&#x27;s transformation accelerates when he becomes blind and must rely on Timothy for survival. This dependency shifts the dynamic between them. Timothy&#x27;s extensive knowledge of the Caribbean islands and survival skills, including building shelter, gathering food, and sourcing water, astonishes Phillip. Through Timothy&#x27;s patient teaching, Phillip learns to be self-sufficient, fostering mutual respect and a deep bond between them. The culmination of this bond is evident in Phillip&#x27;s profound grief at Timothy&#x27;s death. After a hurricane devastates their shelter, Timothy succumbs to exposure, and Phillip, devastated, digs a grave for him and mourns deeply. This emotional response signifies the profound impact Timothy had on Phillip&#x27;s life and perspective.

Upon returning to Curaçao, Phillip spends significant time with the workers at St. Anna Bay, many of whom knew and remembered Timothy fondly. Phillip&#x27;s interactions with these individuals further underscore his transformation. He no longer harbors the prejudices he once did and feels a deep connection to the community that Timothy was a part of. This evolution marks a complete departure from his earlier, biased views, demonstrating the powerful impact of his experiences on the cay and his relationship with Timothy.

==Controversy==
&quot;The Cay&quot; was both widely acclaimed and criticized for its impact on promoting racial harmony, and it received the Jane Addams Children&#x27;s Book Award in 1970. In 1974, when NBC-TV adapted the story for a television drama, the Council on Interracial Books for Children held a press conference urging viewers to call their local stations if they felt the story contained an insidiously &quot;racist&quot; message. During this conference, the current chair of the Addams Award Committee, who was not in that role when the award was given, stated that she believed it was a mistake to have named &quot;The Cay&quot; an award winner due to its perceived racist theme. In response, the author, Theodore Taylor, who viewed the work as a subtle plea for better race relations and understanding, returned the award &quot;by choice, not in anger, but with troubling questions.&quot; Taylor later reported that the award had been rescinded. Although &quot;The Cay&quot; remains listed as an Addams Award winner, Taylor&#x27;s claim of rescission is widely accepted and has become a part of the discussion surrounding the book, which is required reading in many schools in the United States and internationally.

=== Censorship and banning incidents ===
In 2020, the Burbank Unified School District banned the book from the curriculum on the back of complaints from four parents who allege the material in the book could lead to potential harm to the district&#x27;s Black students. The ban was opposed by organisations such as PEN America and the National Coalition Against Censorship on the basis that the book helped support discussions about contemporary racism.

==Adaptation and sequel==
* The book was adapted into a TV film in 1974 with Alfred Lutter as Phillip, James Earl Jones as Timothy, and Gretchen Corbett as Phillip&#x27;s mother. Phillip&#x27;s father was not in the movie.
* In 1993, Taylor published &quot;Timothy of the Cay&quot;, a book which tells both of Phillip&#x27;s life after and of Timothy&#x27;s life before the ordeal.

<text>Isdud () was a Palestinian village in the region of Tel Ashdod that was depopulated in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Khalidi says it may have had historic links to Azdud, a postal stop between al-Ramla and Gaza, and the ancient city of Ashdod. The name appears in documents from the time of Mamluk-rule in the mid-15th century. In the Ottoman period, there were 75 households. In 1922, it had a population of 2,566 (2,555 Muslims and 11 Christians) and in 1945, 4,620 Arabs and 290 Jews. During the 1948 war, the Arab inhabitants fled or were expelled. 

Today, the village&#x27;s ruins form part of the Tel Ashdod archaeological site, which lies within the jurisdiction of the Be&#x27;er Tuvia Regional Council. The central village mosque stands at the top of the site, as does the khan and the tomb of Sheikh Abu Qubal.

==Names==

The name &quot;Isdud&quot; is a variant on the name of ancient Ashdod, which is first attested in the form of 11th century BCE Egyptian lists, where is it transcribed as &quot;ísdd&quot;, which scholars have determined is derived from the Late Bronze Age Canaanite &quot;&#x27;aṯdādu&quot;.

In the Islamic period, the geographer Ibn Khordadbeh referred to the city as &quot;Azdud&quot;, echoing the pre-Hellenistic name. By the 16th century, it had lost its initial vowel to become just &quot;Sdud&quot;, before regaining it by the 19th century as &quot;Esdud,&quot; and then &quot;Isdud.&quot;

==History==

===Ancient and classical period===
The ancient city of Ashdod rose to prominence in the 12th century BCE, when the Philistines ruled the city as &quot;Asdadu&quot; and the city was a member of their pentapolis, a group of five key cities. alongside Ascalon, Gaza, Ekron and Gath.

&quot;Asdûdu&quot; later led the revolt of Philistines, Judeans, Edomites, and Moabites against Assyria, before one of Sargon II&#x27;s generals destroyed the city and exiled its residents, including some Israelites who were subsequently settled in Media and Elam. In 605 BCE, Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar conquered it, and in 539 BCE it was rebuilt by the Persians, before being conquered in 332 BCE by Alexander the Great.

During the Hellenistic period, the city was known as &quot;Αzotus&quot; ( and prospered until the Maccabean Revolt, during which Judas Maccabeus took the city and &quot;laid it waste&quot;. It was then ruled by Alexander Jannaeus of the Hasmoneans, before being made independent again by the Roman general Pompey. In 55 BCE, the Roman general Gabinius also helped to rebuild Azotus.

During the Byzantine period, Azotus was overshadowed by Azotus Paralios, a nearby port and the inland city&#x27;s maritime counterpart. The 6th-century Madaba Map shows both under their respective names.

===Medieval period===

The geographer Ibn Khordadbeh (c. 820 – 912) referred to the inland city as &quot;Azdud&quot; and described it as a postal station between al-Ramla and Gaza.

12-century Crusader church endowments and land deeds mention settlement in Azotum/Azdūd. During the Mamluk period, Isdud was a key village along the Cairo—Damascus road, which served as a center for rural religious and economic life.

===Ottoman period===
In the Ottoman period, the location of the village of Isdud on the ancient &quot;Via Maris&quot; route preserved the village&#x27;s importance. In the first Ottoman tax register of 1526/7, the village had a population of 40 Muslim households and four bachelors, and it belonged to the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Gaza (Gaza Sanjak). By 1596 CE, the population of Ashdod (named &quot;Sdud&quot;) reached 75 households, about 413 persons, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on wheat, barley, sesame and fruit crops, as well as goats and beehives; a total of 14,000 Akçe.

Marom and Taxel have shown that during the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries, nomadic economic and security pressures led to settlement abandonment around Majdal &#x27;Asqalān, and the southern coastal plain in general. The population of abandoned villages moved to surviving settlements, while the lands of abandoned settlements continued to be cultivated by neighboring villages. Thus, Isdud absorbed the lands of Kharijat Isdud, an unidentified subsidiary settlement near Isdud mentioned in the Ottoman tax registers.

In 1838, &quot;Esdud&quot; was noted as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.
In the late nineteenth century, Isdud was described as a village spread across the eastern slope of a low hill, covered with gardens. A ruined khan stood southwest of the village. Its houses were one-storey high with walls and enclosures built of adobe brick. There were two main sources of water: a pond and a masonry well. Both were surrounded by groves of date-palm and fig-trees.

====British Mandate====

In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Isdud had a population of 2,566 inhabitants; 2,555 Muslims and 11 Christians, where the Christians were all Catholics.

The population increased in the 1931 census to 3,240; 3,238 Muslims and 2 Christians, in a total of 764 houses.

During the Mandatory period, Isdud had two elementary schools; one for boys which was opened in 1922, and one for girls which started in 1942. By the mid-1940s the boy-school had 371 students, while the girl-school had 74.

The official Village Statistics, 1945 for &quot;Isdûd&quot; gave a population of 4,620 Arabs and 290 Jews in a total land area of 47,871 dunams []. Of this, 3,277 dunams were used citrus and bananas, 8,327 for plantations and irrigable land, 23,762 for cereals, while 131 dunams were built-on land.

In addition to agriculture, residents practiced animal husbandry which formed was an important source of income for the town. In 1943, they owned 480 heads of cattle, 117 sheep over a year old, 50 goats over a year old, 169 camels, 18 horses, 21 mules, 328 donkeys, 5790 fowls, and 3079 pigeons.

===1948 Arab–Israeli War===
The village of Isdud was occupied by the Egyptian army on May 29, 1948, and became the Egyptians&#x27; northernmost position during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. While the Israelis failed to capture territory, and suffered heavy casualties, Egypt changed its strategy from offensive to defensive, thus halting their advance northwards. Egyptian and Israeli forces clashed in the surrounding area, with the Egyptians being unable to hold the Ad Halom bridge over the Lachish River. Israeli forces surrounded the town during Operation Pleshet, and shelled and bombed it from the air. For three nights from 18 October the Israeli Air Force bombed Isdud and several other locations. Fearing encirclement, Egyptian forces retreated on October 28, 1948, and the majority of the residents fled. The 300 townspeople who remained were driven southwards by the Israel Defense Forces. The village was part of territory that was granted to Israel in the 1949 Armistice Agreements following the end of the war.

===Israel===
In 1950, two moshavim, Sde Uziyahu and Shtulim, were established to the east of Isdud, on village land. Bnei Darom (in 1949) and Gan HaDarom (in 1953) were established north of Isdud, on village land. The city of Ashdod was founded in 1956 north of Isdud.

In 1992, Isdud was reported as destroyed, with only a few ruined buildings including the village mosque remaining.

<doc id="649532" wikidata="Q1417860" url="?curid=649532" title="Fort Mackinac">
<text>Fort Mackinac ( ) is a former British and American military outpost garrisoned from the late 18th century to the late 19th century in the city of Mackinac Island, Michigan, on Mackinac Island. The British built the fort during the American Revolutionary War to control the strategic Straits of Mackinac between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and by extension the fur trade on the Great Lakes. The British did not relinquish the fort until thirteen years after the end of the American Revolutionary War.
Fort Mackinac later became the scene of two strategic battles for control of the Great Lakes during the War of 1812. During most of the 19th century, it served as an outpost of the United States Army. Closed in 1895, the fort has been adapted as a museum on the grounds of Mackinac Island State Park.

==History==

===American Revolutionary War===
Before 1763, the French used Fort Michilimackinac on the mainland south shore of the Straits of Mackinac to control the area. After the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British occupied the French fort but considered the wooden structure too difficult to defend. In 1780/1781, its lieutenant governor Patrick Sinclair constructed a new limestone fort on the limestone bluffs of Mackinac Island above the Straits of Mackinac. The British held the outpost throughout the American Revolutionary War. Captain Daniel Robertson commanded the garrison on Mackinac Island from 1782 to his replacement in 1784 by Lieutenant George Clowes. Despite the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1783), the British did not officially relinquish the fort to the United States until 1796.

===War of 1812===
In June 1812, British Major-General Isaac Brock heard that America had declared war and sent a canoe party to Fort St. Joseph, Ontario to confirm that a state of war existed. This party returned with an order to attack Fort Mackinac, then known as Fort Michilimackinac.

A minimal United States garrison of approximately sixty men under the command of Lieutenant Porter Hanks then manned Fort Mackinac. Although a diligent officer, Hanks had received no communication from his superiors for months. On the morning of July 17, 1812, a combined British and Native American force of seventy war canoes and ten bateaux under the command of British Captain Charles Roberts attacked Fort Mackinac. Roberts came from Fort St. Joseph and landed on the north end of Mackinac Island, from the fort. The British removed the village inhabitants from their homes and trained their two 6-pounder iron cannons at the fort. The Americans, under Lieutenant Hanks, were taken by surprise and Hanks perceived his garrison was badly outnumbered. The officers and men under Roberts numbered about two hundred (including 180 Canadians); a few hundred Native Americans of various tribes supported him.

Fearing that the Native Americans on the British side would massacre his men and allies, Lieutenant Hanks accepted the British offer of surrender without a fight. The British paroled the American forces, essentially allowing them to go free after swearing to not take up arms in the war again. They made the island inhabitants swear an oath of allegiance as subjects of the United Kingdom.

Shortly after the British captured the fort, two American vessels arrived from Fort Dearborn (Chicago), unaware of the start of the War of 1812, or the fort&#x27;s capture by British forces. The British raised the American flag and when the vessels tied up at the pier, the British captured the two sloops as prizes of war. The ships were &quot;Erie&quot; (Captain Norton) and (Captain Lee), the latter being taken by the British into service as . The schooners &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Salina&quot;, anchored at port, were sent by the British to Detroit as cartels carrying the prisoners they had taken.

After capturing the island, the British under the command of Colonel Robert McDouall of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment built Fort George, a stockade and blockhouse on the highest point of the island, to prevent the Americans from re-capturing the island using the same strategy. Lieutenant Hanks made his way to Detroit and the American military post there. Upon his arrival, superiors charged him with cowardice in the surrender of Fort Mackinac. Before the court martial of Lieutenant Hanks could begin, British forces attacked Fort Detroit. A British cannonball ripped through the room where Hanks was standing, cutting him in half and killing the officer next to him as well.

United States Army Colonel George Croghan and his superior General William Henry Harrison designed a campaign to take control of the Great Lakes and sever the fur trade alliance between the British and the tribes of the region; as part of this campaign, the Americans attempted to retake Mackinac Island in July 1814. The two-pronged campaign also included an assault on Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, located on the upper Mississippi River.

===Battle of Mackinac Island (1814)===
On July 26, 1814, a squadron of five United States ships arrived off Mackinac Island, carrying a landing force of 700 soldiers under the command of Colonel Croghan. This landing began the Battle of Mackinac Island. To his dismay, Colonel Croghan discovered that the new British blockhouse stood too high for the naval guns to reach, forcing an unprotected assault on the wall of Fort George. The Americans shelled Fort George for two days with most shells falling harmlessly in vegetable gardens around the fort.

A dense fog forced the Americans back from Mackinac Island for a week. Major Andrew Holmes led the American forces in returning; they landed at the north end of the island near the location of the British assault in 1812. The Americans worked their way to the fort through dense woods, which Native American allies of the British protected, finally emerging into a clearing below Fort George.

Colonel McDouall had placed a small force bearing muskets, rifles, and two field guns behind low breastworks at the opposite end of the clearing. When the Americans emerged from the woods into the clearing, the British guns targeted them easily. British forces killed 13 Americans, including Major Holmes and two other officers, and wounded 51 others. The heavy losses compelled Colonel Croghan to order his men to retreat back through the woods to the beach. The Americans rowed back to their ships and retreated.

The American defeat in the Battle of Mackinac Island left the island and its forts in the hands of the British through the end of the War of 1812. Following the Treaty of Ghent, American forces reoccupied Fort Mackinac in July 1815. They renamed Fort George as Fort Holmes, in honor of Major Holmes, killed in the 1814 attack. After the War of 1812 and settlement of the northern border and tensions with Britain, Fort Mackinac gradually declined in military significance.

===Later years===
No longer needed as a front line border defense against the British in Canada, the fort was used as a strategic troop reserve. The Army essentially could deploy troops to Fort Mackinac until a need arose to transfer them to other locations of military importance. The Army nearly abandoned Fort Mackinac between such uses. It was also used as a fur trading post, as Mackinac Island was an important fur post. From 1816 to 1821 the post was commanded by Benjamin Kendrick Pierce, the older brother of President Franklin Pierce. He married the daughter of Magdelaine Laframboise, a prominent fur trader of Ojibwe and French descent.

On June 6, 1822, a fur trader named Alexis St. Martin waited to trade in his furs when a gun accidentally discharged just inches from him, blowing a hole in his abdomen. The post surgeon, Doctor William Beaumont, attended to him. Dr. Beaumont cared for the presumably doomed St. Martin the best he could. To his surprise, the man appeared to make a recovery. Beaumont took St. Martin into his home, caring for him for several years. St. Martin healed although his stomach had a hole. Beaumont seized the opportunity and began observing and conducting experiments on the man. Through these experiments, Beaumont described the process of digestion in detail, unlocking its mysteries. Beaumont wrote a book about his experiments and later became known as &quot;The Father of Gastric Physiology.&quot;

The fort developed as an important staging area for US exploration of the northern Michigan Territory, including the expedition in 1820 under the command of Lewis Cass to explore the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft held the post of United States Indian agent at Fort Mackinac for a time in the 1830s. He did extensive study of the Native American languages and culture of the region, aided by his marriage to Jane Johnston, the Ojibwe-British daughter of John Johnston, a wealthy British fur trader at Sault Ste. Marie. Both her parents&#x27; families were prominent among the elite of the region.

During the Mexican–American War and for long periods during the Civil War, the Army left the care and upkeep of Fort Mackinac to an ordnance sergeant. Despite these periods of relative inactivity, the fort played a small role in the Civil War, briefly used as a prison for three Confederate political prisoners. Brought to Mackinac Island and the fort during the summer months, these three men enjoyed relative freedom, guarded only by a volunteer militia. When faced with the prospect of enduring a long, harsh winter on the island, two of the prisoners signed loyalty oaths and obtained release. The third Confederate refused, and the Army ultimately transferred him to another post.
Seth Eastman, an officer and artist in the United States Army, in 1872 made an oil painting of Fort Mackinac, as a commission by the US Congress of paintings of military forts. It is now part of the collection of the United States Senate. His more important work was to illustrate Henry Rowe Schoolcraft&#x27;s six-volume history of the American Indians, commissioned by Congress in the 1850s.

===Mackinac National Park===

From 1875 to 1895, Mackinac National Park, the second national park in the United States after Yellowstone National Park, included Fort Mackinac and much of Mackinac Island. During the national park years, the troops stationed at Mackinac acted as park rangers. The Army tasked these men with maintaining the park, so they spent much time cutting new roads and footpaths through the park.

To improve conditions and boost morale, the Army constructed a bathhouse at the fort (in which every man at the fort was required to bathe at least once a week), a post toilet (complete with flush toilets), and a post canteen (where the men could read current magazines, play pool, and buy beer and wine). They wanted Fort Mackinac to be a &quot;desirable station.&quot; Soldiers also had regular military duties, drilling on the parade ground and taking target practice at least once a week on either a 600- or 1000-yard rifle range. The skills learned at the fort later proved important for many troops who were posted at other locations in the still-dangerous American West.

==Decommissioning==

===State administration===
In 1895, Congress closed Fort Mackinac and Mackinac National Park. It transferred the fort and park to the State of Michigan, which created Mackinac Island State Park, the first state park in Michigan. The semi-autonomous Mackinac Island State Park Commission in 1895 began governing Fort Mackinac and the other surrounding historic sites on or near Mackinac Island: Colonial Michilimackinac, Historic Mill Creek, the Old Mackinac Point Lighthouse, and Mackinac Island State Park. The Governor of Michigan appoints members of the commission, who meet many times during the course of a year to govern Mackinac State Historic Parks. The commission and historic parks preserve, protect, and present the rich and natural history of Mackinac Island and the Straits area.

In the 1950s, Mackinac Island State Park Commission developed a new way of financing its park, based on the system that financed the Mackinac Bridge. Michigan financed construction of Mackinac Bridge through revenue bonds repaid from the cash flow of toll fees from the bridge after it opened in 1957. Mackinac Island State Park Commission modified this idea for park restoration purposes, with Fort Mackinac admission fees serving as the cash flow. More than three-fourths of budget of Mackinac Island State Park Commission now comes from admission fees and other self-generated cash flow. Most United States parks-and-recreation agencies instead depend upon public subsidies. Mackinac Island State Park Commission operates one of the largest parks in United States that generates a significant majority of its own operating budget.

===The Fort today===
The current museum at the park includes 14 historic buildings.
Today, Fort Mackinac is a popular heritage tourist destination. Situated on 150-foot bluffs above the Straits of Mackinac, it is one of the few surviving American Revolutionary War forts and one of the most complete early forts in the country. In 2015, Fort Mackinac celebrated 235 years standing guard over Mackinac Island.

During the main tourism summer months (June through August), visitors ascend into a bustle of activity within the old British-built stone walls of old Fort Mackinac after entering its weathered gates. Costumed interpreters greet visitors, portray life in the 1880s, answer questions, pose for pictures, and lead tours throughout the day. Some of the &quot;soldiers&quot; carry original 45-70 Springfield Model 1873, the type used at the fort during the 1880s. Others play music or greet and mingle with the crowds of visitors.
The 1841 model six-pounder is fired many times daily. It is the second-largest cannon regularly demonstrated on the Great Lakes. Activities also include rifle firings, court martial re-enactments, and dances of the type done during the early days of Fort Mackinac with live musicians.

===Extant buildings===
There are 14 original buildings as part of the fort museum:
:1. Commissary Building: Once used for food storage; today houses a video program.
:2. Post Headquarters: Used for the paymaster and offices.
:3. Quartermaster&#x27;s Storehouse: Held any and all equipment needed by the soldiers during the Fort&#x27;s history.
:4. Post Bathhouse: The newest building, built in 1885, housing 6 baths for the soldiers&#x27; comfort.
:5. Soldiers Barracks: Used to house the more than 100 soldiers stationed there, but today houses a museum and the gift shop called the Sutler&#x27;s Store.
:6. Post Schoolhouse: Provided education for soldiers
:7. Hill Quarters: Many lieutenants lived in these officers&#x27; quarters. Rank was rewarded.
:8. Post Hospital: Where the post doctor/surgeon treated patients until a new hospital was built in 1860.
:9. Officer&#x27;s Stone Quarters: Michigan&#x27;s oldest building (1780), used to house officers. Today holds the Kids Quarters and the Tea Room.
:10. Wood Quarters: Used for various purposes over the life of the building, including officers&#x27; quarters and a post canteen that served Schlitz beer, but no whiskey.
:11. Post Guardhouse: Prisoners were held on this site for over a century.
:12-14: North, East, and West Blockhouses: Stone towers built by the first Americans garrisoning Fort Mackinac.

<doc id="649534" wikidata="Q192634" url="?curid=649534" title="Bülent Ecevit">
<text>Mustafa Bülent Ecevit (; 28 May 1925 – 5 November 2006) was a Turkish politician, statesman, poet, writer, scholar, and journalist. He served as the Prime Minister of Turkey four times between 1974 and 2002. He served as prime minister in 1974, 1977, 1978–1979, and 1999–2002. Ecevit was chairman of the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) between 1972 and 1980, and in 1987 he became chairman of the Democratic Left Party (DSP). 

Ecevit began his political career when he was elected a CHP MP from Ankara in the 1957 election and came to prominence as Minister of Labour in İsmet İnönü&#x27;s cabinets, representing the rising left-wing faction of the party. Ecevit eventually became leader of the CHP in 1972; his leadership rejuvenated the party by reaching out to working class voters and cementing the party as &quot;Left of Center&quot;. Ecevit became prime minister in 1974, during which he retracted the ban on cultivation of opium and invaded Cyprus. He formed two more governments in 1977 and 1978–1979 which were marked by increasing polarization, deadlock, and political violence that ended with the 1980 coup. 

Following the coup, Ecevit, along with most politicians, was banned from politics for ten years. During the ban, the Democratic Left Party (DSP) was established under the chairmanship of his wife, Rahşan. When the political ban was lifted in 1987, he became the head of the DSP. While heading a caretaker government for the 1999 election, PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was captured in Kenya, catapulting DSP into first place in the election. The DSP-MHP-ANAP coalition (1999–2002) introduced important political and economic reforms, as well as beginning Turkey&#x27;s accession into the European Union. The MHP&#x27;s withdrawal from the coalition led to the government&#x27;s collapse, and in the subsequent 2002 snap election, the DSP was ejected from parliament after being unable to clear the electoral threshold. Ecevit resigned the chairmanship of the party in 2004. He died on Sunday, November 5, 2006, as a result of circulatory and respiratory failure.

Ecevit is known for being Turkey&#x27;s only leftist prime minister. His chairmanship resulted in the highest shares of votes CHP or any other left-wing party have ever gained in Turkish history. He is credited for introducing social democratic politics to Turkey by synthesizing Kemalism with social democracy, thus making social democracy a core tenet in modern Kemalist ideology. Ecevit is the last non-AKP Prime Minister of Turkey.

== Early life ==
Mustafa Bülent was born 28 May 1925 in Istanbul to a middle-class family. He was named after his paternal grandfather Mustafa Şükrü Efendi, who was an Islamic scholar of Kurdish origin with roots in the region of Tunceli but born in a village in Kastamonu. Mustafa Şükrü&#x27;s son and Bülent&#x27;s father Fahri Ecevit was a professor of forensic medicine in Ankara University&#x27;s Law School. Fahri later entered politics and served as a Republican People&#x27;s Party member of parliament for Kastamonu between 1943-1950. His mother of Bosniak ancestry, Fatma Nazlı, was among the first women in Turkey to paint professionally.

Bülent Ecevit&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather was the Meccan Sheikh-ul-Islam Hacı Emin Pasha, who served to protect the holy sights of Hejaz in the Ottoman Empire. The inheritance of his estate, which consisted of approximately 110 decares of land and 99 acres of the Masjid an-Nabawi was left to him once Ecevit&#x27;s mother died. One lawyer valued the estate at almost $2 billion, while unofficial valuation made by a Medina Court put it at $11 billion. In the end Ecevit donated the proceeds of the estate to the Directorate of Religious Affairs for the benefit of Turkish Hajjis, after his retirement from politics.

Ecevit had no siblings and would have no children.

=== Education, journalism, and writing ===
In 1944, Ecevit graduated from Robert College in Istanbul. He started work as a translator at the General Directorate for Press and Publication (Turkish: &quot;Basın Yayın Genel Müdürlüğü&quot;). In 1946, shortly after marrying his classmate Zekiye Rahşan Aral, he moved to London to work in the Turkish embassy as a press attaché. During his stay he studied Bengali, Sanskrit and Art History at the School of Oriental and African Studies but did not graduate. He also indulged in composing Sufi poetry. 
Bülent Ecevit was not only a politician but also a poet, journalist and a writer. In the 1950s, he worked as an editor for &quot;Ulus&quot;, and then &quot;Yeni Ulus&quot;, &quot;Halkçı&quot;, and &quot;Forum&quot;. He later reported that both &quot;Ulus&quot; and &quot;Forum&quot; were two significant parts of his intellection life of that period.

In 1955 Ecevit went to the United States for three months as a guest journalist for the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot; in North Carolina, and was disturbed by the racism he witnessed in the American South. On his last day at the newspaper he wrote a front-page article about how strange it was that Americans took it upon themselves to fight oppression in the world while white Americans were 

On a State Department fellowship, he returned to the US with a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship Scholarship in 1957, studying social psychology and Middle East history at Harvard University for eight months. He attended lectures on anti-communism with Olof Palme and Bertrand Russell and attended Henry Kissinger&#x27;s Harvard International Seminar.

Even as a politician he continued writing for various newspapers, including the daily &quot;Milliyet&quot; in 1965, the monthly &quot;Özgür İnsan&quot; magazine in 1972, the weekly &quot;Arayış&quot; in 1981, and the monthly &quot;Güvercin&quot; magazine in 1988. Ecevit also translated works by Rabindranath Tagore, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Bernard Lewis into Turkish. Ecevit was successful in these literary endeavors despite never having graduated from a university, a fact that prevented him from ever running for the Presidency of the Turkish Republic.

== Early political career ==
Bülent Ecevit returned to Turkey in 1950 as a journalist, eventually writing for &quot;Ulus&quot;. Writing about politics made him interested in pursuing a career of it, so he registered with the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) Çankaya branch in 1954, eventually taking part in its Youth Branch Executive Board. At the age of thirty two, he was elected into parliament for the first time in 1957, representing Ankara as a member of the CHP. He was part of the party&#x27;s delegation to the Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution after the 1960 military coup d&#x27;état. At the age of thirty six, he served as the Minister of Labour in three coalition governments headed by İsmet İnönü between 1961 and 1965. Under his purview, the Law on Collective Bargaining, Strikes and Lockouts was signed, which as well as expanding social security privileges, finally allowed Turkish workers the right to strike and collective bargaining.

By 1965, Ecevit was the leader of the &quot;Democratic Left Movement&quot;, a young and energetic left-wing faction in the CHP. His closeness with left-wing politics came from his admiration of the Labour Party and the burgeoning welfare state he was exposed to while studying in Britain. He pressured his mentor İnönü to adopt a new party program known as Left of Center for the general elections that year, arguing that democratic socialism was the best way to combat communism. The party lost the election to Süleyman Demirel&#x27;s center-right Justice Party. In opposition, the party was racked with internal power struggles, as Ecevit and Turhan Feyzioğlu fought over the party&#x27;s political orientation. İnönü reluctantly favored Ecevit (who he thought was too young), and in the 18th ordinary CHP congress held in 1966 he was elected secretary general of the CHP. An extraordinary congress held the next year saw 47 deputies and senators led by Feyzioğlu leave the CHP to found the Reliance Party. In 1969, secretary general Ecevit announced a village development program and using the slogan &quot;Land for those who cultivate it, water for those who utilize it.&quot;

Another inter-party crisis occurred in the military memorandum of 1971, as Ecevit resigned from his position in protest against İnönü&#x27;s decision to support the military government. He objected the memorandum, saying that it was directed against the Left of Center movement within the CHP. Heated exchanges occurred between the once old allies, with at one point İnönü saying &quot;[It&#x27;s] Either me or Bülent!&quot; promising that he would resign if his party did not have confidence in him. On 8 May 1972 İsmet İnönü lost a vote of confidence to Ecevit in an extraordinary congress. İnönü thus was the first general chairman in Turkish political history to lose his position as a result of a party leadership vote.

== CHP chairman ==
Despite the conflict between İnönü and Ecevit originally being about the former&#x27;s support for the technocratic military government, Ecevit initially provided ministers to the Melen government, but withdrew support soon after a reaction from his party base. Rumours circulated that CHP would be banned by the military.

In the 1973 presidential election, both Ecevit and Demirel agreed to end the soldier-president tradition and voted against Faruk Gürler. The two compromised to support Fahri Korutürk&#x27;s candidacy as the president, who was an admiral. However, secretary general Kamil Kırıkoğlu still voted for Gürler and he and 32 CHP deputies resigned from the party. 

=== First premiership (1974) ===
The CHP&#x27;s electability was put to the test in the general elections of 1973. With the campaign slogan &quot;Akgünlere&quot; (&quot;To brighter days&quot;), the help of labour unions, and other leftist groups, the CHP won 185 deputies with 33.3% of the votes, winning a plurality of the votes and seats in parliament. Ecevit was invited to form a government and formed a coalition with the Islamist National Salvation Party (MSP) headed by Necmettin Erbakan. 

A general amnesty that saw 40,000 rightists and leftists leave jail was implemented, as well as lifting the ban on opium cultivation that was previously implemented by the military governments under heavy American pressure. The age to vote was lowered to 18.

In July 1974, inter-communal violence in Cyprus once again flared up when pro-EOKA forces staged a coup against president Makarios. Ecevit went to London to meet with British officials, as the UK is also a guarantor state of Cyprus, but a common policy for the situation in Cyprus was not found. Ecevit decided to militarily intervene and invaded Cyprus, for which he is nicknamed the &#x27;Conqueror of Cyprus&#x27; (). This resulted in an arms embargo by the United States on Turkey which lasted for three years.

As a left-wing nationalist, Ecevit initially believed Turkey&#x27;s destiny was not with Europe. He extended this Eurosceptic sentiment to his economic policy, not only establishing generous social programs and enabling a larger government role in the economy, but also raising protective tariffs to keep cheap foreign goods out of Turkey. His combative stance against Athens prevented Turkey from joining the European Economic Community jointly with Greece in 1979.

=== Polarization ===
After much conflict with his coalition partner and hoping to gain more support for his government through a snap election, Ecevit resigned as prime minister after just 10 months of governing. He was outflanked when the right-wing parties united to form the First Nationalist Front under Demirel&#x27;s premiership, during which Turkish politics became heavily polarized and violent. The CHP defeated the Justice Party in the 1977 general elections by gathering 41.38% of the votes, the highest share of votes CHP and any other left-wing party has ever gained in Turkish history. Despite winning the election, Ecevit did not have a majority and was unable to form a coalition, so he formed a minority government which lasted just one month. Demirel subsequently took over as prime minister and formed another right-wing government known as the Second Nationalist Front.In what was known as the Güneş Motel Incident, Ecevit was able to bring down Demirel&#x27;s government on 5 January 1978, after announcing to the press &quot;I am looking for 11 deputies who have no gambling debts.&quot; He became prime minister for a third time with a narrow majority by forming a government supported by the Democratic Party, Republican Reliance Party, and 11 independent MPs who defected from the Justice Party to take cabinet positions in the new government. His third premiership was marked by a peak in political violence which manifested in Kahramanmaraş and Malatya against Alevis and CHP supporters and their subsequent reprisals against right wing activists. Ecevit suspected the &quot;Counter-Guerrilla&quot;, the Turkish branch of Gladio, was responsible for the massacres and for the Taksim Square massacre in Istanbul, during which snipers fired on a protest rally of 500,000 citizens, killing 38 and injuring hundreds. In later interviews, Ecevit recalled that he first learned about the existence of Operation Gladio, a secret &quot;stay-behind&quot; NATO army, in 1974. His government issued martial law on the final days of December 1978 in thirteen provinces mainly in southeastern Turkey, but also in Istanbul and Ankara. With allegations of corruption between Ecevit and the independent MPs, TÜSİAD requesting his resignation by printing advertisements on newspapers, and defeat in the 1979 by-elections, Ecevit resigned as prime minister on 14 October 1979. Without a majority, Demirel returned as premier. In the lead up to another military intervention in 1980, parliament attempted 115 times to vote for a new president. 

==== Assassination attempts ====
Bülent Ecevit was subject to six assassination attempts. All but one occurred in the 1970s. Five happened in Turkey and one in the United States, the most famous of which took place on 23 July, 1976 in New York City by a Greek Cypriot and on 29 May, 1977 at Çiğli Airport. Mehmet İsvan, brother of the Mayor of Istanbul Ahmet İsvan, was injured in the attempt in Çiğli Airport. Various testimonies allege that the weapon used in Çiğli Airport originated from the Special Warfare Department.

== Ban from politics ==
On September 12, 1980 the Turkish Armed Forces seized control of the country. Bülent and Rahşan and most politicians were incarcerated for a month in Hamzaköy, Gelibolu. Along with politicians of all other parties Ecevit was banned from politics for ten years, with the provisional Article 4 of the new constitution. He resigned from the chairmanship of the CHP on October 30, 1980. The Republican People&#x27;s Party and all other existing political parties were banned by the military. He was banned from traveling abroad in April 1981 for his opposition to the military rule. He was twice more imprisoned from December 1981 to February 1982 and August to October 1982 for his opposition to the junta.

This ban on politics did not stop Ecevit from continuing to participate in politics. He refused to associate himself with the successor parties created by old CHP supporters, like the Populist Party and Social Democracy Party. Instead his wife Rahşan Ecevit worked to establish a new political party: the Democratic Left Party (DSP). Bülent was often invited to speak in DSP rallies as a guest speaker. Many lawsuits filed against him on the grounds that he violated his ban on politics with his speeches. When the Populist Party and Social Democracy Party united under the name of the Social Democrat Populist Party (SHP) in November 1985 the Ecevits were criticized for refusing to also merge DSP with SHP, which served to divide the center-left, social-democratic/Kemalist votes.

== DSP chairman ==
With his ban from politics being finally lifted in a referendum in 1987, he took over the chairmanship of DSP, inheriting the position from Rahşan. His party failed to enter the Grand National Assembly for polling below 10% in the general elections held two months later, so Ecevit briefly resigned before returning as DSP leader in 1989. Emphasizing the need to preserve national unity and secularism in the general elections held in 1991, he attacked SHP, saying &quot;Do not divide the social democratic votes.&quot; He also criticized SHP for forming an electoral alliance with the new pro-Kurdish People&#x27;s Labor Party, and claimed that the SHP &quot;cooperated with the separatists&quot;. Despite his partial Kurdish heritage, Ecevit refused to recognize Kurds as an ethnic group in his speeches, and would repeatedly oppose legislation to legalize education in Kurdish and Kurdish television. This stance mellowed upon European pressure when he returned to power in 1999. Despite winning 11% of the vote in the election, Ecevit and only six other DSP deputies entered the Grand National Assembly. 

With the ban on the name &quot;Republican People&#x27;s Party&quot; and the acronym &quot;CHP&quot; now lifted, an initiative to reestablish the CHP came to the agenda. Ecevit was invited to the 1992 congress that refounded the CHP, but he did not attend. While SHP merged under the reconstituted CHP in 1995, he again objected to uniting the Kemalist parties. To this day, DSP remains a separate political party from CHP.

DSP&#x27;s fortunes changed after the 1995 elections, when the party won 76 seats out of 550. Ecevit served as deputy prime minister for two years in Mesut Yılmaz&#x27;s government, who was assigned to form a government after Necmettin Erbakan was overthrown by the military in the &quot;postmodern coup&quot;. In 1999, after nearly twenty years, he returned to the premiership for the last time to form a minority government in the run-up to the 1999 general elections. In those elections – helped by the fact that Abdullah Öcalan, head of the PKK, was apprehended in Kenya and flown to Turkey during this period – Ecevit&#x27;s party gained the largest number of seats, allowing him to stay as prime minister in a coalition with Yılmaz&#x27;s centrist Motherland Party and Devlet Bahçeli&#x27;s ultranationalist MHP. Ecevit&#x27;s coalition partners offered to amend the constitution to allow for his presidential candidacy in the 2000 election, which he wasn&#x27;t allowed to partake since he never attained a degree from a higher educational institution. Despite his popularity and parliament willing to amend the Constitution for his candidacy, he refused, instead opting to support the candidacy of independent politician Ahmet Necdet Sezer.

=== Last premiership (1999–2002) ===
==== Domestic policy ====

Ecevit&#x27;s last premiership was his longest at almost four years. In coalition with parties to his right, some which were old foes such as MHP –Ecevit was also appointed PM by his old rival who was now president, Süleyman Demirel– he was criticized for adopting pro-business policies and abandoning his leftist values. The government passed many important laws, including banking reform, unemployment insurance, a law to ensure the autonomy of the Central Bank, qualified industrial zones, tender law, and employment incentive law, to name a few. The government also amended 34 articles of the Constitution to widen fundamental rights and freedoms and undertook a number of reforms aimed at stabilizing the Turkish economy. These were in preparation for accession negotiations with the European Union. Ecevit acknowledged that his past anti-EU views were a mistake, and that Turkey&#x27;s destiny with Europe. His foreign minister İsmail Cem was instrumental in what is currently the latest step of Turkish–EU accession, when in the Helsinki Summit in December 1999, Turkey was recognized as a full candidate country for the European Union. Three major EU harmonisation packages were passed during this government, including the most comprehensive package of August 2002, which included the abolishment of capital punishment. However progress to EU ascension inevitably hit a roadblock, that being of his making; the Cyprus Dispute. 

A massive economic crisis which originated from long overdue problems from previous governments, but ultimately triggered by an incident where President Sezer threw a booklet of the Turkish constitution at Ecevit in a National Security Council meeting, specifically when he claimed economic reform was impossible, caused the value of the Lira to crash in February 2001. Two months later, Ahmet Çakmak, a florist who was struggling from the economic crisis and inspired by Sezer&#x27;s outburst, ran in front of news cameras and shouted &quot;Mr. Prime Minister, I am a tradesman!&quot; throwing a cash register at Ecevit&#x27;s direction as he was walking out of a cabinet meeting. Eventually Ecevit hired the World Bank economist Kemal Derviş his economic minister. With his guidance, the government passed an extensive series of comprehensive economic reforms and regulations. These included changes to the tender law, economic social council law, unemployment insurance, the restructuring of state banks, accreditation law, law on capital markets, and establishment of competition authorities. These successful reforms allowed for Derviş to sign off on a $20 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, which enabled the high growth of 2002–2007 after DSP&#x27;s fall from government.

The Kocaeli earthquake occurred 17 August 1999, killing tens of thousands in Istanbul and İzmit and causing billions in damages. A tax to prevent earthquake damage (also known as the Earthquake tax) was established after the disaster. 

During this period, the &quot;Law of Conditional Release and Postponement,&quot; also known as the Rahşan Amnesty, was passed in reaction to the large amount of hunger strikes occurring in prison, which gave conditional amnesty to crimes other than those committed against the state. Advocated for by Rahşan Ecevit, she commented on the outcome of her law in retrospect, saying &quot;I asked for forgiveness for the poor, [instead] the murderers benefited.&quot; With this amnesty, the number of prisoners decreased from 70,000 to 40,000, but in three years it increased again to 64,000.

==== Foreign policy ====
Bülent Ecevit was a strong opponent of the invasion of Iraq by the US, though he allowed American planes to use bases in Turkey for their air patrols over Northern Iraq. Even still, he criticized American sanctions on Iraq, which he said caused needless suffering.

Ecevit maintained Turkey&#x27;s relationship with Israel, but denounced the IDF&#x27;s raid on the Jenin refugee camp as &quot;genocide&quot; which he later said was meant against both Israel and Fatah.

İsmail Cem achieved a period of rapprochement with Greece after relations were at an all-time low following the Öcalan affair. 

==== Health concerns and government collapse ====
Rumors about Bülent Ecevit&#x27;s ill health were confirmed when he was taken to Başkent University Ankara Hospital on 4 May, 2002, which became a source of national anxiety. He was taken out of the hospital by Rahşan and brought to their home when his condition worsened. Bülent rested at home, but was taken back to the hospital. Rahşan shared her doubts about her husband&#x27;s treatment with public during this period. Her allegations were denied, but the issue was brought up again in the Ergenekon trials in the following years. 

Discussions came to the fore whether Ecevit could continue governing while incapacitated. Nine deputies from the DSP issued a statement on 25 June, demanding &quot;to lead a life without Ecevit under the leadership of Ecevit&quot;. Another group of DSP deputies, who made a press statement on behalf of him on 5 July, openly criticized Deputy Prime Minister Hüsamettin Özkan, one of the closest names to Ecevit. On 7 July, Bahçeli withdrew support from the coalition, and called for early elections. The next day, Özkan resigned, which was followed by the resignation of several ministers and half of DSP&#x27;s parliamentary group, with most of them joining the New Turkey Party, founded by foreign minister Cem. With the resignations, the coalition government lost its numerical support in the parliament. A summit held on 16 July between the leaders of the coalition government resulted in the decision to hold early elections on 3 November 2002. In the vote held in parliament on at the end of July, 449 out of 514 deputies voted to hold an early election.

Allegations of corruption, the economic crisis, as well as Ecevit&#x27;s poor health resulted in DSP facing electoral wipeout in the 2002 general election, attaining only 1.2% of the vote and losing all of its MPs. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) entered parliament with a comfortable majority and governs Turkey to this day. In a press conference held on 25 July 2004 Ecevit announced Zeki Sezer as his successor to DSP, and resigned as chairman. He officially left active politics in summer, and devoted his remaining years to writing.

== Illness and death ==
After attending the funeral of his friend Yücel Özbilgin, who was killed in the Turkish Council of State shooting on 19 May 2006, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, went into a coma and stayed in the intensive care unit of the Gülhane Military Medical Academy for a long time. Ecevit died of circulatory and respiratory failure at 22:40 on Sunday, 5 November, 2006, 172 days after he entered a vegetative state.

Immediately after his death the Grand National Assembly passed a law to allow for prime ministers and speakers of parliament to also be buried in the Turkish State Cemetery () in Ankara, which allowed Bülent to be buried there. Upon the death of Bülent Ecevit&#x27;s wife Rahşan in January 2020, the parliament voted to also have civilians be buried in the State Cemetery, allowing her to be interred there too.

A state funeral was held on 11 November 2006 at the State Cemetery after a funeral prayer in Kocatepe Mosque, attended by approximately a million people from all 81 provinces and from many countries, especially from Northern Cyprus. Five former presidents also attended the funeral.

== Controversies ==

=== Relationship with the Gülen movement ===

Against the advice of the Turkish military, Ecevit visited Fethullah Gülen&#x27;s schools and spoke highly of them. In 1997, the Journalists and Writers Foundation, of which Gülen was an honorary chairman of, presented Ecevit (and Demirel) with the &quot;Award for National Reconciliation in the Field of Politics&quot;.

During the escalation of the 1997 military memorandum crisis, Chief Public Prosecutor Nuh Mete Yüksel prepared an indictment against Gülen. Footage of Gülen&#x27;s speeches years ago were broadcast on a multitude of television channels in which Gülen presented about &quot;how they [the Gülen movement] should be structured in the bureaucracy&quot;. Questioned about Gülen&#x27;s statement later on, Prime Minister Ecevit defended Gülen in an interview, saying that he hasn&#x27;t seen any suspicious behavior in his schools, which provide secular education inline to the principles of Atatürk.

While deputy prime minister, Ecevit requested the Italian Ambassador to greet Gülen when he went to Rome in 1998, which drew a reaction from general Çevik Bir.

=== Merve Kavakçı ===
In the inaugural session of the 21st parliament elected in 1999, Merve Kavakçı entered the Grand National Assembly&#x27;s chamber with a headscarf, which violated Turkey&#x27;s then strictly enforced laicité laws. DSP deputies protested her entrance, graveling their benches and shouting &quot;out!&quot; Ecevit eventually came up to the podium:

Kavakçı did not show up to the second session of parliament, and her MP status was later terminated.

== Personality ==

=== Trademarks ===
Bülent Ecevit&#x27;s trademark was his blue shirt and mariner&#x27;s cap. Another trademark of his was the dove, in his many campaign rallies Ecevit released doves into the air. The dove is also displayed on the logo of DSP. He smoked Bitlis and Parliament cigarettes and wrote with an Erika typewriter, a gift from his in-law, İsmail Hakkı Okday. He donated his 70-year-old typewriter to the METU Science and Technology Museum.

Bülent and Rahşan lived exceptionally modestly and frugally. They had no children.

=== Nicknames ===
The origin of Ecevit&#x27;s popular nickname &quot;Karaoğlan&quot; (a Turkish folk hero) came in a visit to Kars. Shortly after his election as CHP chairman, when found himself guest in the house of his friend Rasim Yarkadaş in Susuz district. Rasim&#x27;s mother welcomed her guest at the door of their house, hugging Ecevit and exclaiming in a distinct Kars dialect, &quot;Save us from these troubles, Garaoğlan!&quot; He also had the nickname &quot;Halkçı Ecevit&quot; (Populist Ecevit).

Süleyman Demirel used the nickname &quot;Allende-Büllende&quot; to compare his rival, Ecevit, to the Chilean socialist statesman Salvador Allende, who was overthrown and committed suicide in a military coup.

Ecevit was also known as &quot;Kıbrıs Fatihi&quot; &quot;Conqueror of Cyprus&quot; after the Cyprus Operation during his premiership, and also as &quot;Kenya Fatihi&quot; &quot;Conqueror of Kenya&quot; after the operation to capture Abdullah Öcalan.

== Legacy ==

Ecevit holds a unique legacy in Turkey&#x27;s political history for being its only left-wing prime minister. There has also been no Kemalist prime ministers since his last government. He was also the last prime minister from the CHP. His chairmanship resulted in the highest shares of votes CHP and any other left-wing party have ever gained in Turkish history. He was the last leader of Turkey before the AKP came into power at his expense in 2002, which has governed Turkey since. Ecevit&#x27;s DSP-MHP-ANAP government was the longest lasting coalition government in Turkish history.

Kartal Bülent Ecevit Cultural Center was put into service in 2005. In 2012 the name of Zonguldak Karaelmas University was changed to “Zonguldak Bülent Ecevit University.&quot; A wax sculpture of him is on display at the Tayfun Talipoğlu Typewriter Museum, which was opened in Odunpazarı, Eskişehir in May 2016. In 2021, a park in İzmir&#x27;s Güzelbahçe district was named after him and his statue was erected.

Vurgun Adalayı portrayed Bülent Ecevit in the TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time in Cyprus&quot;.

Ahmet Çakmak, who threw a cash register at Ecevit in 2001 out of frustration from the economic crisis said the following twenty years later: “Ecevit understood the state of the citizen. After the incident, he talked to me many times and sought a solution. If we did something like this now, we would be [called] terrorists. I miss Ecevit, I visited his grave at least 20 times.&quot;

In the lead up to the 2023 general elections, DSP chairman Önder Aksakal came out in support Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&#x27;s presidential candidacy and was elected from the AKP&#x27;s lists in the 2023 general elections. The Rahşan-Bülent Ecevit Science Culture and Art Foundation stated that [today&#x27;s] DSP has no connection with Ecevit&#x27;s principles that &quot;they should not pollute the names of Ecevit for their own interests.&quot;

<text>Project Ozma was a search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) experiment started in 1960 by Cornell University astronomer Frank Drake, at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank at Green Bank, West Virginia. The object of the experiment was to search for signs of life in distant planetary systems through interstellar radio waves. The program was named after Princess Ozma, ruler of the fictional land of Oz, inspired by L. Frank Baum&#x27;s supposed communication with Oz by radio to learn of the events in the books taking place after &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;. The search was publicized in articles in the popular media of the time, such as &quot;Time&quot; magazine and was described as the first modern SETI experiment.

Drake used a radio telescope with a diameter of to examine the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani near the 1,420 MHz marker frequency, the equivalent of wavelength of 21 centimeters which corresponds to the energy of a photon emitted from a hydrogen atom during &quot;spin-flip&quot; transition. Both are nearby Sun-like stars that then seemed reasonably likely to have inhabited planets. A 400 kilohertz band was scanned around the marker frequency, using a single-channel receiver with a bandwidth of 100 hertz. The information was stored on tape for off-line analysis. Some 150 hours of intermittent observation during a four-month period detected no recognizable signals. A false signal was detected on April 8, 1960, but it was determined to have originated from a high-flying aircraft.

The receiver was tuned to wavelengths near 21 cm, which is the wavelength of radiation emitted naturally by interstellar hydrogen; it was thought that this would be familiar, as a kind of universal standard, to anyone attempting interstellar radio communication.

A second experiment, called Ozma II, was conducted with a larger () telescope at the same observatory by Patrick Palmer and Benjamin Zuckerman, who intermittently monitored 670 nearby stars for about four years (1972–76). They examined a 10 MHz bandwidth with 52 kHz resolution and a 625 kHz bandwidth with 4 kHz resolution. The spectrometer was centered on the 21 cm hydrogen line in the rest frame of each observed star.

<text>The commissioning pennant (or masthead pennant) is a pennant (also spelled &quot;pendant&quot;) flown from the masthead of a warship. The history of flying a commissioning pennant dates back to the days of chivalry with their trail pendants being flown from the mastheads of ships they commanded. Today, the commissioning pennants are hoisted on the day of commissioning and not struck until they are decommissioned. Some navies have a custom of flying a &quot;paying off&quot; or &quot;decommissioning pennant,&quot; the length of which often reflects the length of service of the warship.

==History==
The custom of wearing a pennant at the masthead of a man-of-war stems from Tromp&#x27;s broom and Blake&#x27;s whip. During the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654), Dutch Admiral Maarten Tromp lashed a broom to his flagship&#x27;s masthead as a sign that he had swept the English off the seas. In reply, English Admiral Robert Blake hoisted a whip to the masthead to signify that he would whip the Dutchman into subjection. However, records show that pennants were in use well before this period as the mark of a warship.

In the days of chivalry, knights and their squires carried pennons and pennoncells on their lances, just as men-of-war fly pennants from their masts. Records show that pennants were in use in the 13th century, when merchant ships were commandeered during war and placed in command of military officers, who transferred their trail pendants from their lances to the mastheads of the ships they commanded.

The pennant is an evolution of old &quot;pennoncell&quot;, that in the Royal Navy used to consist of three colours for the whole of its length, and towards the end left separate in two or three tails. The tradition continued until the end of the Napoleonic Wars when the Royal Navy adopted the style of pennants used by the service today. Pennants have been carried by warships from the earliest times, prior to 1653 at the yardarm, but since then at the maintopgallant masthead.

Today the pennant is hoisted on the day a warship or establishment commissions and is never struck until the day of decommissioning. It is, however, displaced by Royal Standards and the personal or distinguishing flags or pennants of commodores and admirals. In Navy ships the pennant is flown at the masthead, for which reason it is also commonly referred to as a masthead pennant.

==Commissioning pennant==
The commissioning pennant reflects the fact that the ship is a ship of war, and is flown until the ship is decommissioned. It is generally taken to signify the commissioned status of the warship. In some navies, the commissioning pennant is used in addition to represent the personal authority of the captain, although it is flown continuously aboard the ship whether the captain is aboard or not.

===Royal Navy===


In the Royal Navy the commissioning pennant is flown continuously in every ship and establishment in commission unless displaced by a senior officer&#x27;s Rank flag. The masthead pennant is a cross of St George in the hoist and a white fly. Formerly, when the Royal Navy was divided into red, white and blue squadrons, there were four different pennants in use, the colour of the fly of three of the pennants corresponding with the colour of the squadron ensign, and a fourth for ships on independent commission (i.e. not attached to a squadron, therefore directly under the command of the Admiralty in London), with the fly containing (from top to bottom) red white and blue in a triband form (such ships would wear the red ensign). Modern commissioning pennants are significantly shorter than in previous centuries - typically 1m in length and only 10 cm at the hoist, tapering to a squared-off point.

A boat carrying a captain of one of His Majesty&#x27;s ships will on ceremonial occasions fly a commissioning pennant from the bows of the boat as a symbol of his authority.

====Royal Canadian Navy====
Since its creation in 1910, until 1990, the Royal Canadian Navy and afterwards, Maritime Command (after unification into the Canadian Armed Forces) used the same commissioning pennant as the Royal Navy. In 1990, the old version was phased out with a new design; replacing the Cross of Saint George with a stylized Canadian red maple leaf.

===Hellenic Navy===
In the Hellenic Navy, the commissioning pennant (, ) is &quot;blue coloured, has shape of isosceles triangle elongated, bearing a white cross near the base of the triangle&quot;. The flag has typically base to length (height of triangle) 1 to 20. The cross has arms width 1/5 base length and each arm length 3/5 of base length. The pennant flown on the top of mainmast.

===Indian Navy===

In the Indian Navy, a white triangular pennant is flown with at hoist a gold-blue octagon bearing the crest of the Indian Navy in the center.

===Indonesian Navy===

In the Indonesian Navy, the commissioning pennant is called the War Pennant () and has the same red and white colors of the Indonesian flag, except it is longer and shaped like a swallowtail flag. The pennant is flown in all Indonesian Navy ships and indicating that the ship is on active duty.

===United States===
====United States Navy and United States Coast Guard====

The commissioning pennant of the United States Navy is &quot;blue at the hoist, bearing seven white stars; the rest of the pennant consists of single longitudinal stripes of red and white.&quot; The commissioning pennant of the United States Coast Guard is a near opposite, being white at the hoist, bearing thirteen blue stars, and with the rest of the pennant consisting of multiple vertical red and white stripes.

Ships of the United States Navy and the United States Coast Guard fly their respective commissioning pennants from the moment of commissioning until the decommissioning ceremony, the only exceptions being when either a flag officer or a civilian official is embarked and the flag officer&#x27;s or civilian official&#x27;s personal flag is flown in its place.

The ensign, jack and commissioning pennant are hoisted directly after the reading out of the commissioning order and struck as the final act before the captain declares the ship decommissioned.

The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard use the respective pennants as the symbol of the vessel&#x27;s commanding officer.
When the vessel&#x27;s commanding officer is ashore, the ship will also display the international code flag known as the Third Substitute pennant.

====NOAA fleet====

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates a fleet of research and survey ships which are in commission for United States Government service, although they are not warships. Ships in the NOAA fleet fly a &quot;commission pennant&quot; in a similar manner to U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships. The NOAA fleet has three commission pennants, one for its largest ships (which it deems &quot;Class I&quot; vessels), and two for smaller ships NOAA defines as &quot;Class II,&quot; &quot;Class III,&quot; or &quot;Class IV&quot; vessels. The pennant for Class I vessels is long and has 13 red triangles on a white background at the hoist, with the remainder of the pennant blue, while the pennants for Class II, III, and IV vessels are long and have seven red triangles but otherwise are identical in design to the Class I pennant. The pennants are identical to those flown by commissioned ships of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, one of the ancestor organizations of NOAA, and the red triangles represent the discipline of triangulation used in hydrographic surveys. The flag of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, used from 1899 to 1970, and that of NOAA, in use since 1970, include a similar red triangle.
=== Taiwanese Navy ===

In the Republic of China (Taiwan) Navy, a red trapezoidal pennant is flown with the Blue Sky with a White Sun in the hoist. The flag has typically base to length 1 to 10, and hoist to fly 5 to 1.

==Paying-off pennants==
It is the custom in many navies for a ship which is &quot;paying off&quot; to wear an extremely long commissioning pennant, which is normally at least the length of the ship, and the length of which reflects the length of service. This is in contrast to the modern practice of using pennants of not more than one or one-and-a-half metres for convenience.

Formerly a ship &quot;paid off&quot; each time she returned home after a commission overseas: the term refers to the fact that sailors were not paid until the ship returned home, to avoid desertion. The bible of Royal Navy traditions and slang, &quot;Covey-Crump&quot;, emphasises:

:&quot;It should be borne in mind that the commission referred to is the length of time the ship&#x27;s company has been abroad, not the ship herself: when a ship recommissions abroad a fresh commission is started; thus a commission of longer than 2¾ years is exceptional.&quot;

This custom is maintained in the United States Navy, where the paying-off pennant is known as the &quot;homeward-bound pennant&quot;. Nevertheless, present usage in the Royal Navy has degenerated to using paying-off pennants only as part of a ship&#x27;s decommissioning ceremony.

<text>Dhankuta ( ) is a hill town and the headquarters of Dhankuta District in Koshi Province in Eastern Nepal. According to 2011 Nepal census, it has population of 26,440 inhabitants.

==History==

Until about 1963, Dhankuta Bazaar (the town) was the administrative headquarters for the whole of north-eastern Nepal. Located a half-mile above the town were the buildings of the Bada Hakim, the feudal district governor of the whole north-eastern region, a man with enormous power. The town also had the regional jail and army post. Because of Dhankuta&#x27;s isolation from the lowland Terai and from Kathmandu, it was in many ways a self-governing area.

Income to purchase items (cloth, kerosene, batteries, medicines, etc.) that could not be produced locally came from a combination of sales of hill produce (tangerines, potatoes, etc.) and funds repatriated back into the hills by Gorkha soldiers serving first in the British and then more-often in the Indian armies.

The first five (3 male; 2 female) American Peace Corps Volunteers arrived in Dhankuta Bazaar in Fall, 1962 to work as teachers in the two high schools. In October 1963 three male PCV&#x27;s arrived to help establish the new Panchayat Development program.

From 1963 Nepal was divided into 75 Panchayat Districts, and the traditional Dhankuta administrative region was divided up into about six of the panchayat districts. The power of the Bada Hakim was transferred to the central government&#x27;s appointed Panchayat Development Officer and each district&#x27;s elected Panchayat President.

During the pre-panchayat period Dhankuta Bazaar prided itself as being in the cultural vanguard, a relatively progressive community with its own &quot;intellectual&quot; elite. Dhankuta Bazaar, already in the 1930s, had the only high school in Nepal to be located outside of the Kathmandu Valley. Early on it added a girl&#x27;s high school and a two-year college.

Then and now there is a sharp contrast between Dhankuta Bazaar and the surrounding rural villages. The town is a commercial center and has a population that is primarily Newar. The surrounding area is agricultural and the population is made up of many caste/tribal groups, notably Athpare, Limbu, Yakkha, Rai, Magar, Tamang and Tibetan.

One of the famous places in &quot;Dhankuta&quot; is &quot;Hile&quot;. It serves as a gateway to &quot;Dhankuta&quot; and &quot;Panchthar&quot; districts and from here, visitors can also trek to the temple of Goddes &quot;Pahtibhara&quot;, situated three kilometers west of the place.Another place situated here is the &quot;Rajarani&quot; valley, which is a place of historical significance and is also believed to be the capital of &quot;Limbu&quot; kingdom in the past.The place that once had two ponds called &quot;Raja&quot; and &quot;Rani&quot; now lay as plain areas.

==Present status==
Dhankuta Bazaar, on the North-South Koshi Highway, is now the administrative headquarters for the Eastern Development Region, and is home to a number of offices for NGOs and aid agencies serving in the area. The large bazaar of Hile further up the road, is an important trading centre and major road head, serving the remote hinterlands of the Arun valley and Bhojpur. Villagers walk for many days from surrounding districts to trade in Hile and Dhankuta bazaars, although road building in the district may reduce the importance of these centers.

‘Nepal&#x27;s cleanest city’ as proposed by The Kathmandu post.

==Vegetation==
The vegetation zones in the district range from sub-tropical Sal forest along the Tamor and Arun rivers, and cooler temperate forests on some of the high ridges that mark the watershed between the two catchments. The altitude ranges from around 300m to 2500m. The majority of the population are involved in agriculture and crops include maize, rice and millet. Important cash crops include citrus fruits, cauliflower, cabbage, ginger, and in recent years, tea. A well-preserved forest (Rani Bhan – Queen&#x27;s Forest) spreads along a ridge line on the northwest side of the village, with well-developed mature stands of rhododendron and pine trees.

==Health centres==

Dhankuta District Hospital is located off the main street at the south end of the town. The hospital has facilities like inpatient service, Ultrasonography and x-ray. Besides the government posted doctors, medical and dental intern doctors from BPKIHS are also posted there.

==Media==
Radio Nepal has a regional station in Dhankuta which transmits various programs of mass interest. Likewise, Radio Lali Guransa (105.2 MHz), Radio Makalu Dhankuta (92.2 MHz), and Radio Dhankuta (106.2 MHz) are community radio stations transmitting local programmes.

<doc id="649547" wikidata="Q2010669" url="?curid=649547" title="Mackinac National Park">
<text>Mackinac National Park was a United States national park that existed from 1875 to 1895 on Mackinac Island in northern Michigan, making it the second U.S. national park after Yellowstone National Park. The park was created in response to the growing popularity of the island as a summer resort. Its creation was largely the result of efforts by United States Senator Thomas W. Ferry, a native of the island. Senate Bill 28 &quot;to set aside a certain portion of the island of Mackinaw and the straits of Mackinaw, within the State of Michigan as a national park&quot; was introduced December 2, 1874, and signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 3, 1875. The national park covered 821 acres while the fort retained 103 acres and the remainder of the island was privately owned.

The park grounds abutted Fort Mackinac, which continued to serve as a United States Army garrison during the operation of the park, as well as island geological features such as Arch Rock and Sugar Loaf. The fort&#x27;s commander ran the park and federal troops served as park rangers, as at Yellowstone. The park had the authority to construct roads and trails and to lease small numbers of lots for buildings to offset its expenses, as no federal money was provided to run the park. The park lands also had to be available to the army for military training and in time of war.

In 1895, the fort was decommissioned and, at the request of Michigan Governor John T. Rich, the park and fort was turned over to the State of Michigan, becoming Mackinac Island State Park, the first state park in Michigan. The park was established on the condition that it remain a state park or it would revert to the United States. This restriction caused a problem in the 1960s when the city proposed to lease land from the park for an expanded airport for the island. The lease to the city was ruled a non-park use but the park, on its own, expanded and continues to run the airport.

<text>Fort Holmes is a fortified earthen redoubt located on the highest point of Mackinac Island. Originally built in 1814 by British forces during the War of 1812, the redoubt was improved by that army throughout the course of the war (1812–1814) to help defend the adjacent Fort Mackinac from a possible attack by the U.S. Army.

The British named the redoubt &quot;Fort George&quot; and reinforced it with cannon, a blockhouse, and a magazine for gunpowder and other munitions. However, Fort Holmes never functioned as an independent military fortification. It was always a dependent outpost of nearby Fort Mackinac.

When United States armed forces reoccupied Mackinac Island in 1815 under the terms of the Treaty of Ghent, they took possession of Fort George. They surveyed and measured their prize, which they renamed Fort Holmes in honor of Major Andrew Holmes, a casualty in the 1814 Battle of Mackinac Island. However, the American army soon abandoned Fort Holmes. The earthworks and buildings of the former redoubt slowly eroded and disappeared over the course of more than a century.

In 1936, as part of its mission to provide employment through public works projects during the nationwide Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration used the original 1817 American survey to rebuild Fort Holmes to its War of 1812 appearance. , however, most of the reconstructed buildings of Fort Holmes had again disappeared, except for the redoubt&#x27;s earthen walls.

In 2015 the Mackinac Island State Park completed a second reconstruction of Fort Holmes that resumes the appearance that the redoubt had in 1817. The blockhouse includes interpretive panels inside, and is open in the summer. Many visitors come to the fort site for a view of the Straits of Mackinac, much of which is visible from this lookout point approximately above the surface of Lake Huron and 890 feet (271 m) above sea level. The redoubt and blockhouse can be rented for special occasions.

<doc id="649572" wikidata="Q391237" url="?curid=649572" title="John Hopfield">
<text>John Joseph Hopfield (born July 15, 1933) is an American physicist and emeritus professor of Princeton University, most widely known for his study of associative neural networks in 1982. He is known for the development of the Hopfield network. Previous to its invention, research in artificial intelligence (AI) was in a decay period or AI winter, Hopfield&#x27;s work revitalized large-scale interest in this field.

In 2024 Hopfield, along with Geoffrey Hinton, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for &quot;foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.&quot; He has been awarded various major physics awards for his work in multidisciplinary fields including condensed matter physics, statistical physics and biophysics.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
John Joseph Hopfield was born in 1933 in Chicago to physicists John Joseph Hopfield (born in Poland as Jan Józef Chmielewski) and Helen Hopfield (née Staff).

Hopfield received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in physics from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania in 1954 and a Doctor of Philosophy in physics from Cornell University in 1958. His doctoral dissertation was titled &quot;A quantum-mechanical theory of the contribution of excitons to the complex dielectric constant of crystals&quot;. His doctoral advisor was Albert Overhauser.

=== Career ===
He spent two years in the theory group at Bell Laboratories working on optical properties of semiconductors working with David Gilbert Thomas and later on a quantitative model to describe the cooperative behavior of hemoglobin in collaboration with Robert G. Shulman. Subsequently he became a faculty member at University of California, Berkeley (physics, 1961–1964), Princeton University (physics, 1964–1980), California Institute of Technology (Caltech, chemistry and biology, 1980–1997) and again at Princeton (1997–), where he is the Howard A. Prior Professor of Molecular Biology, emeritus.

In 1976, he participated in a science short film on the structure of the hemoglobin, featuring Linus Pauling.

From 1981 to 1983 Richard Feynman, Carver Mead and Hopfield gave a one-year course at Caltech called &quot;The Physics of Computation&quot;. This collaboration inspired the Computation and Neural Systems PhD program at Caltech in 1986, co-founded by Hopfield.

His former PhD students include Gerald Mahan (PhD in 1964), Bertrand Halperin (1965), Steven Girvin (1977), Terry Sejnowski (1978), Erik Winfree (1998), José Onuchic (1987), Li Zhaoping (1990) and David J. C. MacKay (1992).

== Work ==
In his doctoral work of 1958, he wrote on the interaction of excitons in crystals, coining the term polariton for a quasiparticle that appears in solid-state physics. He wrote: &quot;The polarization field &#x27;particles&#x27; analogous to photons will be called &#x27;polaritons&#x27;.&quot; His polariton model is sometimes known as the Hopfield dielectric.

From 1959 to 1963, Hopfield and David G. Thomas investigated the exciton structure of cadmium sulfide from its reflection spectra. Their experiments and theoretical models allowed to understand the optical spectroscopy of II-VI semiconductor compounds.

Condensed matter physicist Philip W. Anderson reported that John Hopfield was his &quot;hidden collaborator&quot; for his 1961–1970 works on the Anderson impurity model which explained the Kondo effect. Hopfield was not included as a co-author in the papers but Anderson admitted the importance of Hopfield&#x27;s contribution in various of his writings.

William C. Topp and Hopfield introduced the concept of norm-conserving pseudopotentials in 1973.

In 1974 he introduced a mechanism for error correction in biochemical reactions known as kinetic proofreading to explain the accuracy of DNA replication.

Hopfield published his first paper in neuroscience in 1982, titled &quot;Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities&quot; where he introduced what is now known as Hopfield network, a type of artificial network that can serve as a content-addressable memory, made of binary neurons that can be &#x27;on&#x27; or &#x27;off&#x27;. He extended his formalism to continuous activation functions in 1984. The 1982 and 1984 papers represent his two most cited works. Hopfield has said that the inspiration came from his knowledge of spin glasses from his collaborations with P. W. Anderson.

Together with David W. Tank, Hopfield developed a method in 1985–1986 for solving discrete optimization problems based on the continuous-time dynamics using a Hopfield network with continuous activation function. The optimization problem was encoded in the interaction parameters (weights) of the network. The effective temperature of the analog system was gradually decreased, as in global optimization with simulated annealing.

Hopfield is one of the pioneers of the critical brain hypothesis, he was the first to link neural networks with self-organized criticality in reference to the Olami–Feder–Christensen model for earthquakes in 1994. In 1995, Hopfield and Andreas V. Herz showed that avalanches in neural activity follow power law distribution associated to earthquakes.

The original Hopfield networks had a limited memory, this problem was addressed by Hopfield and Dimitry Krotov in 2016. Large memory storage Hopfield networks are now known as modern Hopfield networks.

== Views on artificial intelligence ==
In March 2023, Hopfield signed an open letter titled &quot;Pause Giant AI Experiments&quot;, calling for a pause on the training of artificial intelligence (AI) systems more powerful than GPT-4. The letter, signed by over 30,000 individuals including AI researchers Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell, cited risks such as human obsolescence and society-wide loss of control.

Upon being jointly awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, Hopfield revealed he was very unnerved by recent advances in AI capabilities, and said &quot;as a physicist, I&#x27;m very unnerved by something which has no control&quot;. In a followup press conference in Princeton University, Hopfield compared AI with discovery of nuclear fission, which led to nuclear weapons and nuclear power.

== Awards and honors ==

Hopfield received a Sloan Research Fellowship in 1962 and as his father, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship (1968). Hopfield was elected as a member of the American Physical Society (APS) in 1969, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1973, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1975, and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1988. He was the President of the APS in 2006.

In 1969 Hopfield and David Gilbert Thomas were awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Prize of condensed matter physics by the APS &quot;for their joint work combining theory and experiment which has advanced the understanding of the interaction of light with solids&quot;.

In 1983 he was awarded the MacArthur Foundational Prize by the MacArthur Fellows Program. In 1985, Hopfield received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and the Max Delbruck Prize in Biophysics by the APS. In 1988, he received the Michelson–Morley Award by Case Western Reserve University. Hopfield received the Neural Networks Pioneer Award in 1997 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

He was awarded the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 2001 &quot;for important contributions in an impressively broad spectrum of scientific subjects&quot; including &quot;an entirely different [collective] organizing principle in olfaction&quot; and &quot;a new principle in which neural function can take advantage of the temporal structure of the &#x27;spiking&#x27; interneural communication&quot;.

Hopfield received the Harold Pender Award in 2002 for his accomplishments in computational neuroscience and neural engineering from the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania. He received the Albert Einstein World Award of Science in 2005 in the field of life sciences. In 2007, he gave the Fritz London Memorial Lecture at Duke University, titled &quot;How Do We Think So Fast? From Neurons to Brain Computation&quot;. Hopfield received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2009 for his contributions in understanding information processing in biological systems. In 2012 he was awarded the Swartz Prize by the Society for Neuroscience. In 2019 he was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics by the Franklin Institute, and in 2022 he shared the Boltzmann Medal award in statistical physics with Deepak Dhar.

He was jointly awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics with Geoffrey E. Hinton for &quot;foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks&quot;. 

In 2025 he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering jointly with Yoshua Bengio, Bill Dally, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Yann LeCun, Jen-Hsun Huang and Fei-Fei Li for the development of modern machine learning.

<doc id="649575" wikidata="Q3068733" url="?curid=649575" title="Heteroglossia">
<text>Heteroglossia is the coexistence of distinct linguistic varieties, styles of discourse, or points of view within a single language (in Greek: &quot;hetero-&quot; &quot;different&quot; and &quot;glōssa&quot; &quot;tongue, language&quot;). The term translates the Russian разноречие [&quot;raznorechie&quot;: literally, &quot;varied-speechedness&quot;], which was introduced by the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin in his 1934 paper &quot;Слово в романе&quot; [Slovo v romane], published in English as &quot;Discourse in the Novel.&quot; The essay was published in English in the book &quot;The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by M. M. Bakhtin&quot;, translated and edited by Michael Holquist and Caryl Emerson.

Heteroglossia is the presence in language of a variety of &quot;points of view on the world, forms for conceptualizing the world in words, specific world views, each characterized by its own objects, meanings and values.&quot; For Bakhtin, this diversity of &quot;languages&quot; within a single language brings into question the basic assumptions of system-based linguistics. Every word uttered, in any specific time or place, is a function of a complex convergence of forces and conditions that are unique to that time and place. Heteroglossia is thus &quot;the base condition governing the operation of meaning in any utterance&quot; and that which always guarantees &quot;the primacy of context over text.&quot; It is an attempt to conceptualize the reality of living discourse, where there is always a tension between centralizing and decentralizing forces. According to Bakhtin, linguistics—to the extent that it operates on the presumption that language is a system—inevitably suppresses the fundamentally heteroglot nature of language as it is lived and experienced by human beings in their day to day realities.

==Languages as points of view==
Any language, in Bakhtin&#x27;s view, stratifies into many voices: &quot;social dialects, characteristic group behaviour, professional jargons, generic languages, languages of generations and age groups, tendentious languages, languages of the authorities, of various circles and of passing fashions&quot;. This diversity of voice is, Bakhtin asserts, the defining characteristic of the novel as a genre. When heteroglossia is incorporated into the novel, it is &quot;another&#x27;s speech in another&#x27;s language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way&quot;.

Bakhtin proposes that these stratifications of language represent distinct points of view on the world, characterized by their own meanings and values. In this view, language is &quot;shot through with intentions and accents&quot;, and thus there are no neutral words. Even the most unremarkable statement possesses a taste, whether of a profession, a party, a generation, a place or a time. To Bakhtin, words do not exist until they are spoken, and in that moment they are imprinted with the signature of the speaker.

Bakhtin identifies the act of speech, or of writing, as a literary-verbal performance, one that requires speakers or authors to take a position, even if only by choosing the dialect in which they will speak. Separate languages are often identified with separate circumstances. The prose writer, Bakhtin argues, must welcome and incorporate these many languages into their work.

==Heteroglossia and linguistics==

Bakhtin rejects the idea that language is a &quot;system&quot; of abstract norms and that the utterance is a mere instantiation of the system of language. In &quot;Discourse in the Novel&quot;, he criticizes linguistics, poetics, and stylistics for misunderstanding the fact that different people and groups speak differently. According to Bakhtin, language, like the psyche and everything else in culture, is never a finished, ordered system: it is a work in progress, always ongoing, never complete. There is a constant tension in language between the attempt to impose order and the fact that life itself is essentially chaotic. Real life is complex, spontaneous, subjective, impulsive, not pre-determined, full of disorder, the unexpected, the unknown, the undefined, the indefinable, and it refuses to be (or rather it &quot;cannot&quot; be) contained in a system that imagines and imposes an order of things. These dis-ordering forces in language, which Bakhtin refers to as &quot;centrifugal&quot;, are not unified or somehow conscious of themselves as forces of opposition. Centrifugal forces are essentially disparate and disunified: attempts to unify them are an ordering project, and thus &quot;not&quot; centrifugal.

The force in culture that strives for unity and order Bakhtin refers to as &quot;centripetal&quot;. It is reflected in language in the standardisation of national languages, in rules of grammar, the writing of dictionaries, and in the science of linguistics. Bakhtin does not object to such an effort, but he insists that it must be recognized as an &quot;imposition&quot; of order on something that fundamentally lacks it: &quot;A unitary language is not something given [дан, &quot;dan&quot;] but is always in essence posited [задан, &quot;zadan&quot;]&quot;. Disciplines like philology, linguistics, stylistics and poetics take something that is an ideal, something that is &quot;posited&quot; in a struggle for social unity, and mistake it for something that really exists. The posited system is &quot;reified&quot; and an explanatory force is arbitrarily bestowed upon it, effectively denying the existence of the living, disordered, heteroglot reality upon which it is imposed. The attempt to systematize language—to objectify, idealize and abstract it into a static set of rules and conventions for signification—is falsely posited as a descriptive or scientific activity, when in reality it is a form of socio-political activism.

According to Bakhtin, language is &quot;always&quot; a multiplicity of language&quot;s&quot;. This is not merely a matter of dialectology, but of the many different &quot;ways of speaking&quot;, which are reflections of the diversity of social experience, of differing ways of conceptualizing and evaluating. Linguistics fails to appreciate the importance of this multiplicity in the reality of language as it is actually lived and practiced. It is not merely a matter of different vocabularies, but a complex of experiences, shared evaluations, ideas, perspectives and attitudes that are &quot;knitted together&quot; (срастаться, &quot;srastat&#x27;sya&quot;) in an organic process: a coalescence of separate entities that have themselves been formed by such a process, which is to say by a living process of adaptation and growth. Different languages reflect different attitudes and worldviews. Linguistic features are not fixed and definitive: they are a consequence—&quot;traces&quot;, &quot;crystallizations&quot;, or &quot;sclerotic deposits&quot;―of these attitudes and worldviews, which are themselves the consequence of particular forms of active participation in life and culture. Such participation is a creative response to the circumstances and demands of daily life: &quot;discourse lives, as it were, beyond itself, in a living impulse (направленность, &quot;napravlennost&quot;&#x27;) toward the object; if we wholly detach ourselves from this impulse all we have left is the naked corpse of the word, from which we can learn nothing at all about the social situation or the fate of a given word in life.&quot;

Bakhtin points to the astonishing variety and variability of languages: there are languages within languages, languages overlapping other languages, languages of small social groups, of large social groups, enduring languages, transitory languages. Any separately identified social group might have its own language, also each year and even each &quot;day&quot;. All these diverse groups are more or less &quot;capable of attracting language&#x27;s words and forms into their orbit by means of their own characteristic intentions and accents, and in so doing to a certain extent alienating these words and forms from other tendencies, parties, artistic works and persons&quot;. There are no &quot;neutral&quot; words, no words that belong to no-one. Thus linguistics, as an abstracting process, can never adequately address the reality of heteroglossia.

==Dialogized Heteroglossia==
Each individual participates in multiple languages, each with its own views and evaluations. Dialogized heteroglossia refers to the relations and interactions between these languages within an individual speaker. Bakhtin gives the example of an illiterate peasant, who speaks Church Slavonic to God, speaks to his family in their own peculiar dialect, sings songs in yet a third, and attempts to emulate officious high-class dialect when he dictates petitions to the local government. Theoretically, the peasant may use each of these languages at the appropriate time, prompted by context, mechanically, without ever questioning their adequacy to the task for which he has acquired them. But languages combined within an individual (or within a social unit of any size), do not exist merely as separate entities, neatly compartmentalised alongside each other, never interacting. A point of view contained in one language is capable of observing and interpreting another from the outside, and vice versa. Thus the languages &quot;interanimate&quot; one another as they enter into dialogue. Any sort of unitary significance or monologic value system assumed by a discrete language is irrevocably undermined by the presence of another way of speaking and interpreting.

According to Bakhtin, such a dialogizing process is always going on in language. Linguistic change is not about change, reaction, readjustment and balance in any systemic sense: it is inherently chaotic and unpredictable, produced by the unforeseeable events of everyday activity. There are no abstract forces at work, there are living people responding to the complex realities of their daily lives. People do not learn their native language from dictionaries, but from the series of exchanges with others in which they participate. Thus the individual encounters the language she assimilates as something that is already dialogized and evaluated. In the assimilation of new words and syntactic forms, which are then employed and deployed for one&#x27;s own purposes, there is no thought of abstracting away their accents and addressivity in order to systematize them. Such words and forms operate in the individual as they operate in their social milieu: as &quot;living impulses&quot;.

==The hybrid utterance==

The hybrid utterance, as defined by Bakhtin, is a passage that employs only a single speaker—the author, for example— but uses different kinds of speech. The juxtaposition of the different speeches brings with it a contradiction and conflict in belief systems.

In examination of the English comic novel, particularly the works of Charles Dickens, Bakhtin identifies examples of his argument. Dickens parodies both the &#x27;common tongue&#x27; and the language of Parliament or high-class banquets, using concealed languages to create humor. In one passage, Dickens shifts from his authorial narrative voice into a formalized, almost epic tone while describing the work of an unremarkable bureaucrat; his intent is to parody the self-importance and vainglory of the bureaucrat&#x27;s position. The use of concealed speech, without formal markers of a speaker change, is what allows the parody to work. It is, in Bakhtin&#x27;s parlance, a hybrid utterance. In this instance the conflict is between the factual narrative and the biting hyperbole of the new, epic/formalistic tone.

Bakhtin goes on to discuss the interconnectedness of conversation. Even a simple dialogue, in his view, is full of quotations and references, often to a general &quot;everyone says&quot; or &quot;I heard that..&quot; Opinion and information are transmitted by way of reference to an indefinite, general source. By way of these references, humans selectively assimilate the discourse of others and make it their own.

Bakhtin identifies a specific type of discourse, the &quot;authoritative discourse,&quot; which demands to be assimilated by the reader or listener; examples might be religious dogma, or scientific theory, or a popular book. This type of discourse is viewed as past, finished, hierarchically superior, and therefore demands &quot;unconditional allegiance&quot; rather than accepting interpretation. Because of this, Bakhtin states that authoritative discourse plays an insignificant role in the novel. Because it is not open to interpretation, it cannot enter into hybrid utterance.

Bakhtin concludes by arguing that the role of the novel is to draw the authoritative into question, and to allow what was once considered certain to be debated and open to interpretation. In effect, novels not only function through heteroglossia, but must promote it; to do otherwise is an artistic failure.

<doc id="649578" wikidata="Q982347" url="?curid=649578" title="John Murtha">
<text>John Patrick Murtha Jr. ( ; June 17, 1932 – February 8, 2010) was an American politician from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Murtha, a Democrat, represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s 12th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1974 until his death in 2010. He is the longest-serving member of the United States House of Representatives ever elected from Pennsylvania.

A former Marine Corps officer, Murtha was the first Vietnam War veteran elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. A member of the Pennsylvania House from 1969 to 1974, he narrowly won a special election to Congress in 1974 and was successively reelected every two years until his death. In the first decade of the 21st century, Murtha had been best known for his calls for a withdrawal of American forces in Iraq, as well as questions about his ethics.

In 2006, after the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 midterm elections he made an unsuccessful bid to be elected House Majority Leader during the 110th Congress (2007–2009) with the support of the new House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, losing to Steny Hoyer of Maryland. As the Democrats became the majority party in the House in 2007, Murtha re-assumed his chairmanship of the House Appropriations&#x27; Defense Subcommittee. He had previously chaired this subcommittee from 1989 to 1995 and served as its ranking member from 1995 to 2007.

==Background==
Murtha was born into an Irish-American family in New Martinsville, West Virginia, near the border with Ohio and Pennsylvania, and grew up in Paden City, West Virginia and then Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, a largely suburban county east of Pittsburgh. He was the son of Mary Edna (née Ray) and John Patrick Murtha.

As a youth, he became an Eagle Scout. He also worked delivering newspapers and at a gas station before graduating from The Kiski School, an all-male boarding school in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania.

Murtha left Washington and Jefferson College in 1952 to join the Marine Corps and was awarded the American Spirit Honor Medal for displaying outstanding leadership qualities during training. He became a drill instructor at Parris Island and was selected for Officer Candidate School at Quantico, Virginia. He was then assigned to the Second Marine Division, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. As an undergraduate, Murtha was initiated into the Kappa Sigma fraternity.

Murtha remained in the Marine Forces Reserve and ran a small business, Johnstown Minute Car Wash (which still operates in the West End section of Johnstown). He also attended the University of Pittsburgh on the G.I. Bill, and received a degree in economics. Murtha later took graduate courses from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

Murtha left the Marines in 1955. He remained in the Reserves after his discharge from active duty until he volunteered for service in the Vietnam War, serving from 1966 to 1967, serving as a battalion staff officer (S-2 Intelligence Section) with the 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, receiving the Bronze Star with Valor device, two Purple Hearts, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. He retired from the Marine Corps Reserve as a colonel in 1990, receiving the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.

==Political career==
Soon after returning from Vietnam, Murtha won the Democratic nomination for what was then the 22nd District, which was based in Johnstown. He lost fairly handily to longtime Republican incumbent John Saylor.

Murtha was elected to represent the 72nd legislative district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in a special election on May 20, 1969. The election was triggered by the death of Representative Edward McNally, who died in November 1968. He was elected to a full term in 1970.

Congressman Saylor died in October 1973, nine months into his 13th term. Murtha immediately jumped into the special election contest in what was now the 12th District. In the February 1974 special election, which took place during the burgeoning Watergate scandal, Murtha defeated one of Saylor&#x27;s former aides, Harry Fox, by only 242 votes, and was sworn in on February 20. He defeated Fox for a full term by a significantly wider margin in the general election that November and was re-elected 17 times.

Murtha faced tough primary challenges in 1982, 1990 and again in 2002. The 1982 challenge occurred when the Republican-controlled state legislature took advantage of Murtha&#x27;s connection to Abscam and incorporated most of the district of fellow Vietnam War veteran and Democrat Don Bailey of Westmoreland County into the 12th District. The 2002 challenge occurred when the state legislature redrew the district of Democrat Frank Mascara to make it more Republican-friendly, shifting a large chunk of Mascara&#x27;s former territory into Murtha&#x27;s district. Mascara opted to run against Murtha in the Democratic primary since the new 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha&#x27;s. However, Mascara was badly defeated.

In 2002, Murtha managed Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s campaign to become House Minority Whip where she defeated Steny Hoyer. 
In 2006, Murtha&#x27;s Republican challenger was Diana Irey, a county commissioner from Washington County, the heart of Mascara&#x27;s former district. Irey attacked Murtha for his criticism of the Iraq war. Even though Irey was Murtha&#x27;s strongest Republican opponent in decades, she polled well behind Murtha throughout the campaign. A poll by the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; on October 12, 2006, showed Murtha with a commanding lead over Irey, 57%–30%. In the November election, Murtha won 61%–39%.

On June 9, 2006, Murtha informed Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi that he would run for Majority Leader if the Democrats gained control of the House in the 2006 midterm elections. Despite Murtha receiving Pelosi&#x27;s support, Steny Hoyer was elected to the post.

On March 18, 2008, Murtha endorsed Hillary Clinton, former First Lady and then senator from New York, in her bid for the presidency.

On February 6, 2010, two days before his death, Murtha became the longest-serving Pennsylvania congressman in history. Although he was not sworn into office until February 20, 1974, House of Representatives rules state that Murtha&#x27;s service began at his election because the seat was vacant.

In 2009, Murtha heard details from Fort Benning U.S. Army soldiers on how their current uniforms and equipment were not providing camouflage in Iraq and Afghanistan during a personal visit. Murtha immediately took action and convinced the army to fix the camouflage problem, resulting in MultiCam being selected by the Secretary of the Army John McHugh for all incoming soldiers deploying to Afghanistan in 2010, only weeks after Murtha had died.

===Abscam investigation===
In 1980, during his fourth term as a Congressman, Murtha became embroiled in the Abscam investigation, which targeted dozens of congressmen. The investigation entailed FBI operatives posing as intermediaries for Saudi nationals hoping to bribe their way through the immigration process into the United States. Murtha met with these operatives and was videotaped. He did agree to testify against Frank Thompson (D-NJ) and John Murphy (D-NY), the two Congressmen mentioned as participants in the deal at the same meeting and who were later videotaped placing the cash bribes in their trousers. The FBI videotaped Murtha responding to an offer of $50,000, with Murtha saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested... at this point. [If] we do business for a while, maybe I&#x27;ll be interested, maybe I won&#x27;t,&quot; right after Murtha had offered to provide names of businesses and banks in his district where money could be invested legally. The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office reasoned that Murtha&#x27;s intent was to obtain investment in his district. Full length viewing of the tape shows Murtha citing prospective investment opportunities that could return &quot;500 or 1000&quot; miners to work.

===Earmarks and campaign contributions===
Murtha was targeted by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington as one of the 20 most corrupt members of Congress.

In September 2006, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) listed Murtha under Five Members to Watch in its Second Annual Most Corrupt Members of Congress Report. The report cited Murtha&#x27;s steering of defense appropriations to clients of KSA Consulting, which employed his brother Robert, and the PMA Group, founded by Paul Magliocchetti, a former senior staffer on the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense.

In 2008, &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot; named him one of the 10 worst members of Congress because of his opposition to ethics reform and the $100 million a year he brought to his district in earmarks. The Wall Street Journal has called him &quot;one of Congress&#x27;s most unapologetic earmarkers.&quot; According to the &quot;Pennsylvania Report&quot;, Murtha was one of &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;s most powerful congressmen&quot; and a &quot;master of crossing the aisle and bringing pork into his district.&quot;

In February 2009, &quot;CQ Politics&quot; reported that Murtha was one of 104 U.S. representatives to earmark funds in the 2008 Defense appropriations spending bill for a lobbying group that had contributed to his past election campaigns. The spending bill, which was managed by Murtha in his capacity as chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, secured $38.1 million for clients of the PMA Group in the single fiscal law. The PMA Group was under investigation by the FBI.

In March 2009, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that a Pennsylvania defense research center regularly consulted with two &quot;handlers&quot; close to Murtha while it received nearly $250 million in federal funding via Murtha&#x27;s earmarks. The center then channeled a significant portion of the funding to companies that were among Murtha&#x27;s campaign supporters.

===Views on the 2003 Iraq War===
Murtha voted for the October 2002 resolution that authorized the use of force against Iraq. However, he later began expressing doubts about the war. On March 17, 2004, when Republicans offered a &quot;War in Iraq Anniversary Resolution&quot; that &quot;affirms that the United States and the world have been made safer with the removal of Saddam Hussein and his regime from power in Iraq,&quot; when J. D. Hayworth called for a recorded vote, Murtha voted against it.

Still, in early 2005 Murtha argued against the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. &quot;A premature withdrawal of our troops based on a political timetable could rapidly devolve into a civil war which would leave America&#x27;s foreign policy in disarray as countries question not only America&#x27;s judgment but also its perseverance,&quot; he stated.

In 2006, after Murtha became a leading critic of the Iraq War, a conservative website, the Cybercast News Service (part of L. Brent Bozell III&#x27;s Media Research Center) published an article that &quot;quoted Murtha opponents as questioning the circumstances surrounding the awarding of his two Purple Hearts.&quot; The attack recalled the &quot;swiftboating&quot; tactic used against Senator John Kerry two years early. A Murtha spokesman called the allegations &quot;an attempt to distract attention from what&#x27;s happening in Iraq.&quot;

===2005 Resolution on removing American forces from Iraq===
On November 17, 2005, Murtha submitted H.J. Res. 73 in the House of Representatives, calling for the redeployment of U.S. troops in Iraq, saying, &quot;The U.S. cannot accomplish anything further in Iraq militarily. It is time to bring them home.&quot;

The bill cited lack of progress towards stabilizing Iraq, the possibility that a draft would be required to sustain sufficient troop numbers, Iraqi disapproval of US forces and approval of attacks on the soldiers, and the increasing costs of the war. The bill proposed that deployment to Iraq be suspended and that US Marines establish an &quot;over-the-horizon&quot; presence in nearby countries.

Murtha&#x27;s comments forced a heated debate on the floor of the House on November 18. Republicans led by Duncan Hunter of California, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, responded by proposing their own resolution (H. Res. 571), which many Republicans said was intended to demonstrate that those calling for immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq were &quot;out of the mainstream.&quot; Murtha himself took the floor during debate on the resolution after the Democrats yielded all their time to him, and denounced the Hunter resolution as a sham. As expected, Hunter&#x27;s resolution was defeated, with only three congressmen voting aye.

===Jean Schmidt and the &quot;coward&quot; controversy===
On November 19, 2005, during debate on adopting the rule for the resolution, Congresswoman Jean Schmidt (R-Ohio) made a statement attributed to Danny Bubp, an Ohio state Representative and Marine Corps reservist. The statement, &quot;He also asked me to give Congressman Murtha a message: that cowards cut and run; Marines never do,&quot; was seen as an unwarranted &quot;cheap shot&quot; against Murtha, and outraged Democrats brought House business to a halt for ten minutes until Schmidt herself asked and received permission to withdraw her comments. Bubp has since stated that he never mentioned Murtha when making the quoted comment. He added that he would never question the courage of a fellow Marine. Bubp later said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be interjected into this. I wish (Congresswoman Schmidt) never used my name.&quot;

===Haditha, Iraq, killings===

The Haditha incident occurred on November 19, 2005, and since then there have been differing accounts of exactly what took place.

In November 2005 Murtha announced that a military investigation into the Haditha killings had concluded that U.S. Marines had intentionally killed innocent civilians. Referring to the first report about Haditha in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Murtha said:

It&#x27;s much worse than reported in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. There was no firefight. There was no IED that killed these innocent people. Our troops overreacted because of the pressure on them and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood. And that&#x27;s what the report is going to tell.

The Marine Corps responded to Murtha&#x27;s announcement by stating that &quot;there is an ongoing investigation; therefore, any comment at this time would be inappropriate and could undermine the investigatory and possible legal process.&quot; Murtha was criticized by conservatives for presenting a version of events as simple fact before an official investigation had been concluded.

In August 2006, Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich filed a lawsuit against Murtha for character defamation during an ongoing investigation into the Haditha incident. In April 2009 this suit was dismissed by a federal appeals court, which ruled that Murtha could not be sued because he was acting in his official role as a lawmaker when he made the statements.

On December 21, 2006, the US military charged Wuterich with 12 counts of unpremeditated murder against individuals and one count of the murder of six people &quot;while engaged in an act inherently dangerous to others.&quot; Charges were subsequently dropped against seven of the eight Marines involved: Capt. Lucas McConnell, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani, Sgt. Sanick Dela Cruz, Lance Corporal Stephen Tatum, Lance Corporal Justin Sharratt, Capt. Randy Stone, and 1st Lt. Andrew Grayson. Only Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich still faced trial on 9 counts of involuntary manslaughter, and in 2012 as part of a plea deal he pleaded guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty.

===&quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; story and correction===
In a speech at Florida International University on June 24, 2006, Murtha said that the military presence in Iraq was hurting U.S. credibility, citing a poll by the Pew Research Center indicating that people in several countries considered the U.S. in Iraq to be a greater threat to world peace than either Iran or North Korea. When the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; reported the speech on June 25, it asserted without further evidence that it was Murtha&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; view that the U.S. was a greater threat to world peace: &quot;American presence in Iraq is more dangerous to world peace than nuclear threats from North Korea or Iran, U.S. Representative John Murtha, D-Pa., said to a crowd of more than 200 in North Miami Saturday afternoon.&quot;

The &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; story was picked up by the wire services and the Drudge Report website, leading several conservative pundits, including Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Tucker Carlson, and Newt Gingrich to comment. After the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; issued a correction, O&#x27;Reilly publicly apologized.

===2008 presidential election===
After having endorsed Hillary Clinton, commenting on the prospects for the election of Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign, Murtha became the subject of controversy after deriding many of his own constituents as &quot;racists&quot; who would not vote for Obama because he is black. In response to the outrage at his comments, he apologized but then reiterated the point by saying, &quot;[T]here&#x27;s still folks that have a problem voting for someone because they are black. This whole area, years ago, was really redneck.&quot;

==Political views==
Murtha generally opposed gun control, earning an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund.

In 2004, he was one of only two congressmen to vote for a measure proposing reinstatement of the draft.

Murtha voted for the Affordable Healthcare for America Act (HR 3692), which passed the House 220–215 on November 7, 2009. He said of the bill, &quot;For nearly a century, both Democrats and Republicans have failed to enact comprehensive health care reform. Today&#x27;s historic vote moves us closer to solving America&#x27;s health care crisis.&quot; However, Murtha did not support allowing abortions as part of health care reform. He voted for the Stupak–Pitts Amendment to the health care bill that prohibits elective abortions for people covered by the public healthcare plan and to prohibit people receiving federal assistance from purchasing a private healthcare plan that includes abortions, except when the woman&#x27;s life is in danger. He also voted for a bill to prohibit pregnant minors from crossing state borders to obtain abortions.

In August 2009, Murtha refused Republican challenger Tim Burns&#x27; invitation to attend a town hall meeting focused on healthcare (at the time, Murtha had not yet hosted a town hall meeting); however, Murtha had held several conference call sessions with his constituents focused on healthcare.

Murtha, an anti-abortion Democrat, did not receive favorable ratings from abortion and reproductive health interest groups. Planned Parenthood, whose stated purpose is &quot;to provide comprehensive reproductive and complementary health care,&quot; gave him a rating of 50% in 2009. He received a rating of 50% from the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which advocates &quot;access to voluntary, comprehensive and culturally sensitive family planning and reproductive health care services and... reproductive freedom for all&quot;.

== Personal life ==
He married his wife Joyce on June 10, 1955. They had three children: a daughter, Donna, and twin sons, Patrick and John M., who live in Johnstown.

===Death and legacy===

Murtha was first hospitalized with gallbladder problems for a few days in December 2009 and had surgery on January 28, 2010, at Bethesda Naval Hospital. Longtime friend and fellow Pennsylvania Democratic representative Bob Brady said Murtha&#x27;s large intestine was damaged during the normally routine laparoscopic surgery, causing an infection. Due to the complication, Murtha was again hospitalized two days later, and died on the afternoon of February 8, 2010, in the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Virginia, with his family by his side. He was buried on February 16, 2010, at Grandview Cemetery in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on the day of his death, &quot;With the passing of John Murtha, America has lost a great patriot.&quot; House Republican Leader John Boehner said, &quot;Our nation has lost a decorated veteran.&quot;

On April 9, 2010, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus signed an official memo to the Chief of Naval Operations, designating the naming of an amphibious transport dock (LPD), a type of naval warship, as the (LPD-26). The &quot;Navy Times&quot; said the official announcement &quot;added fuel to an already smoldering backlash online.&quot;

In October 2011, it was revealed that the FBI had investigated Murtha for possible ethics violations. No charges were ever filed.

A special election was held to fill the seat left vacant by the late congressman, taking place on May 18 to coincide with that state&#x27;s primaries for Senate and governor. The Democratic candidate, Mark Critz, defeated Republican candidate Tim Burns to win Murtha&#x27;s seat.

The University of Pittsburgh houses The John P. Murtha Congressional Papers containing the documentation of Representative Murtha and his duties while in office. The collection contains correspondence, legislative files, reports, subjects covering the Defense Department, the Department of the Interior, economic development, energy, and labor. The collection also contains photographic and audio-video materials, memorabilia, and awards.

The John Murtha Johnstown–Cambria County Airport is named after the Congressman.

<text>Halil Turgut Özal (; 13 October 192717 April 1993) was a prominent Turkish politician, bureaucrat, engineer and statesman who served as the 8th President of Turkey from 1989 to 1993. He previously served as the 26th Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 as the leader of the Motherland Party. He was the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey in the military government of Bülend Ulusu between 1980 and 1982.

After working briefly at the World Bank in the United States and as a university lecturer, Özal became the general secretary and later the leader of the main miners&#x27; trade union of Turkey in 1979, serving as a chief negotiator during large-scale industrial action in 1977. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in the 1977 general election as a National Salvation Party (MSP) candidate from İzmir. In 1979, he became an undersecretary to Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel&#x27;s minority government until the 1980 military coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the 24 January decisions, which paved the way for greater neoliberalism in the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in Bülend Ulusu&#x27;s government and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy.

Özal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties was lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and Özal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. Özal&#x27;s foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the Şimşek Incident and temporarily allowed Bulgarian Turks to emigrate to Turkey.

Özal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Yıldırım Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister. Despite assuming a ceremonial role with minimal political duties, Özal remained occupied with government activities, such as intervening in the 1990 Zonguldak miners&#x27; strikes. While Akbulut took a docile approach as Prime Minister, disputes over the President&#x27;s and Prime Minister&#x27;s duties were dominant when Süleyman Demirel became Prime Minister after the 1991 general election. The Southeastern Anatolia development project began with the construction of the Atatürk Dam in Şanlıurfa, while Özal participated in the first ever summit of Turkic Republics in 1992 held in Ankara. He maintained close relations with the President of the United States George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War. Özal died unexpectedly while in office in 1993, with an exhumation in 2012 leading to evidence of poisoning but the cause of death was unclear.

==Early life and career==
Halil Turgut Özal was born in Malatya, the eldest of three sons. His mother was originally from Çemişgezek, Tunceli and of either half or full Kurdish descent. 

His parents have been described as &quot;devout Muslims&quot;, his father having trained as an imam before becoming a branch manager at the state-owned Agricultural Bank while his mother was an elementary school teacher associated with the community of İskenderpaşa, affiliated with the Naqshbandi Sufi order, and Turgut Özal himself would get involved with the group later on.

He completed elementary school in Silifke, middle school in Mardin, and high school in Kayseri. Özal studied electrical engineering at Istanbul Technical University, graduating in 1950.

Between 1950 and 1952, he worked at the State Electrical Power Planning Administration and continued his studies in the United States on electrical energy and engineering management between 1952 and 1953. After his return to Turkey, he worked in the same organization again on electrification projects until 1958. Özal was in the State Planning Organization in 1959, and in the Planning Coordination Department in 1960. After his military service in 1961, he worked at several state organizations in leading positions and lectured at ODTÜ (Middle East Technical University). The World Bank employed him between 1971 and 1973. Then, he was chairman of some private Turkish companies until 1979. Back to the state service, he was undersecretary to Turkish Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel until the military coup on 12 September 1980.

==Political career==
The military junta under Kenan Evren appointed him state minister and deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs until July 1982.

=== Prime Ministry era (1983–1989) ===
In the parliamentary elections of 1977 he became a candidate for the National Salvation Party (MSP) on the insistence of his brother, but did not succeed. On 20 May 1983 he founded the Motherland Party () and became its leader. His party won the elections and he formed the government to become the 19th Prime minister on 13 December 1983. In 1987 he again became prime minister after winning elections. During his tenure as a prime minister he was involved in shaping the foreign economic relations of Turkey and with his support the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey (DEİK) was established in 1986. He also began to take delegations of business leaders on his foreign trips. 

He became the head of the transformation of the social and economic outlook of Turkey which led by the Motherland Party due to the wider global trend of neoliberal transformation with anti-labor-union discourses.

===Assassination attempt===

On 18 June 1988 he survived an assassination attempt during the party congress. One bullet wounded his finger while another bullet missed his head. The assassin, Kartal Demirağ, was captured and sentenced to life imprisonment but pardoned by Özal in 1992. Demirağ was allegedly a Counter-Guerrilla, contracted by the movement&#x27;s hawkish leader, General Sabri Yirmibeşoğlu. Two months later, Yirmibeşoğlu became the Secretary-General of the National Security Council. During Yirmibeşoğlu&#x27;s tenure as secretary general, Özal heard about the allegations of Yirmibeşoğlu&#x27;s role in the affair and forced him into retirement. In late 2008, Demirağ was re-tried by the Ankara 11th Heavy Penal Court and sentenced to twenty years in prison. In 2013 Özal&#x27;s son Ahmet Özal said that several months before the assassination attempt Özal had survived a plane incident in which his official plane lost an engine and crash-landed. The manufacturer later reported a 95% probability that the plane would have exploded under the circumstances present.

=== Presidency (1989–1993) ===
On 9 November 1989, Özal became the eighth President of Turkey elected by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the first president to be born in the Republic of Turkey rather than the Ottoman Empire.

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Özal made an effort to found alliances with the Turkic countries of Central Asia as well as Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus.
He was also a keen proponent of the country&#x27;s rapprochement with the Middle East and the Muslim countries. Ozal was very supportive of the Gulf War, urging President George H. W. Bush to go to war with Iraq, with which Turkey shared a border. He said that Saddam Hussein &quot;must go&quot; and called him &quot;more dangerous than Gaddafi.&quot; 

Özal&#x27;s free market instinct perhaps defined some of his greatest achievements - the opening up of the Turkish economy. At a stroke, capital controls were abolished - Turks could take out or bring in whatever declared foreign currency they wished. He also liberalized the foreign exchange regime and embarked on one of the most aggressive and ambitious export-driven policies anywhere in post-war history.

The watchword of this campaign was &quot;Export-or-Die&quot;. Turkish contractors such as Kutlutaş, Enka, STFA and Tekfen, to name but a few, alone amassed $20 billion worth of contracts in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Libyan markets in the 1980–1990 decade.

President Turgut Özal agreed to negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK). Apart from Özal, himself half-Kurdish, few Turkish politicians were interested, nor was more than a part of the PKK itself. A first round occurred in the early 90s, and led to a cease-fire declaration by the PKK on 17 March 1993. After the president&#x27;s death on 17 April 1993, in suspicious circumstances, the hope of reconciliation evaporated, and the Castle Plan, which Özal had opposed, was enacted. Some journalists and politicians maintain that Özal&#x27;s death was part of a covert military coup in 1993 aimed at stopping the peace plans.

Özal had a firm vision of a Turkey straddling as a bridge between Asia and Europe – a modern and scientific Turkey. He strongly believed that Islam is compatible with democracy and accountability, and that a Muslim country can also be modern, scientific and progressive.

== Controversies ==
=== Views on the Armenian genocide ===
The issue of the Armenian genocide was part of Özal&#x27;s agenda because he came to believe that Turkey&#x27;s ongoing denial policy harmed his country&#x27;s international relations. He wanted to reach an agreement with the Armenians and solve the problem as soon as possible by making compromises. The reason for this was his first confrontation with the topic of the genocide in the 1950s while he was still studying in the United States. Özal noticed an emerging Armenian lobby which aimed to introduce the recognition of the Armenian Genocide on the political agenda in the United States.

When he became prime minister in 1983, the Armenian issue was one of the topics on his agenda. However, he faced tough challenges as the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) intensified its attacks on Turkish diplomats abroad in the early 1980s. The ASALA factor made it very difficult to take any bold steps in domestic politics with respect to bridging the gap between Turks and Armenians. Behind closed doors, Özal defended the idea of holding negotiations with Armenians to settle a dispute that has had great potential to deal a serious blow to Turkish interests in international politics.

In 1984, Özal tasked his advisers to work out different scenarios of the political and economic costs that Turkey would have to incur if it would agree to compromise with the Armenian diaspora and recognize the Genocide. In 1991, after a meeting with representatives of the Armenian community, Özal said in front of journalists and diplomats:

Özal tried to implement several projects, including the &quot;Van project&quot;, as part of his solution to the Genocide issue. The Van Project envisioned the return of some lands to Armenians in Van. However, Özal was unable to make concrete progress because his policies sparked criticism and fury among the Turkish public, the Motherland Party, and the Turkish military as they considered the idea of negotiating with the Armenian diaspora itself as unacceptable and unthinkable. After Özal&#x27;s death, his policies of compromising with the Armenians in order to solve the conflict concerning the Armenian genocide were abandoned.

==Death and exhumation==

On 17 April 1993 Özal died of a suspicious heart attack while still in office, leading some to suspect an assassination. Özal had first become ill a month earlier.

He died just before he had the chance to negotiate with the Kurdish rebel organization, the PKK. His wife Semra Özal claimed he had been poisoned by lemonade and she questioned the lack of an autopsy. The blood samples taken to determine cause of death were lost or disposed of. Özal had sought to create a Turkic union, and had obtained the commitment of several presidents of the newly independent Turkic states from the former Soviet Union. His wife Semra alleged that the perpetrator might have wanted to foil the plan.

Hundreds of thousands of people attended the state burial ceremony in Istanbul, in which Özal was buried next to the mausoleum of Adnan Menderes. Among those attending were dignitaries of 72 countries, including several heads of state and government, such as Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis, Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, German President Richard von Weizsäcker, and Azerbaijani President Abulfaz Elchibey attended the funeral, as well as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker.

On the fourteenth anniversary of his death, thousands gathered in Ankara in commemoration. Investigators wanted to exhume the body to examine it for poisoning. In September 2012, a court ruled that the grave be opened for another autopsy. On 3 October 2012 his body was exhumed. It contained the banned insecticide DDT at ten times the normal level. According to press reports, the &quot;partially embalmed&quot; remains were found to be well preserved, much to the experts&#x27; and public&#x27;s surprise. It is reported that while the lower half of the body was subject to skeletonization, the upper half was preserved due to adipocere.

An autopsy report issued on 12 December 2012 stated his body contained poison but the cause of death was unclear. A trial charging retired general Levent Ersöz with his murder began in September 2013 who eventually was cleared of all charges.

== Legacy ==

Numerous streets, parks, and public buildings in Turkey are named after Özal.

==Family and personal life==
With his wife Semra, Özal had two sons: Ahmet and Efe, and a daughter: Zeynep. Ahmet Özal, was elected to parliament after the elections of 1999, but stayed out after the elections of 2002. 

Turgut was a member of a powerful Islamic order in Turkey, Community of İskenderpaşa, which is a Turkish branch of the Naqshbandi tariqah.

<text>China Radio International (CRI) is the state-owned international radio broadcaster of China. It is currently headquartered in Babaoshan, Shijingshan, Beijing. It was founded on December 3, 1941, as Radio Peking. It later adopted the pinyin form Radio Beijing.

CRI is the international radio arm of the China Media Group, under the control of the Central Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party, created following the first session of the 13th National People&#x27;s Congress in March 2018. CRI states that it &quot;endeavours to promote favourable relations between the PRC and the world&quot; while upholding the PRC&#x27;s official positions. CRI claims to &quot;play a significant role in the PRC&#x27;s soft power strategy&quot; and Go Out policy, aiming to expand the influence of Chinese culture and media in a global stage. CRI attempts to employ new media and partnerships with other media outlets to compete with other international media. Unlike other broadcasters, CRI&#x27;s control via indirect majority ownership or financial support of radio stations in various nations is not publicly disclosed.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the parent company of CRI, the China Media Group, to be &quot;State Controlled Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== History ==

Radio was first introduced in China in the 1920s and 1930s. However, few households had radio receivers. A few cities had commercial stations. Most usage of radio was for political purpose, frequently on a local area level.

The Chinese Communist Party first used radio in Yanan Shaanxi Province in March 1940 with a transmitter imported from Moscow. Xinhua New Chinese Radio (XNCR) went on the air from Yanan on December 30, 1940. XNCR transmitted to a larger geographical area after 1945, and its programs became more regular and formalized with broadcasts of news, official announcements, war bulletins, and art and literary programs.

The English service started on September 11, 1947, transmitting as XNCR from a cave in Shahe in the Taihang Mountains, when China was in the midst of a civil war, to announce newly conquered areas and broadcast a Chinese political and cultural perspective to the world at large. The station moved from the Taihang Mountains to the capital, Peking, when The People&#x27;s Republic of China was formed in 1949. Its name was changed to Radio Peking on April 10, 1950, and to Radio Beijing in 1983. On January 1, 1993, the name of the station was again changed, this time to China Radio International, in order to avoid any confusion with local Beijing radio broadcasting. Its online broadcasting platform: China International Broadcasting Network (CIBN) was formally established in 2011, as a joint venture of China Radio International, Huawen Media Investment, JinZhengYuan, Youku, Oriental Times Media and Suning Holdings Group.

Radio Peking began exchanges with Voice of America in 1982. Voice of American had opened a bureau in Beijing the previous year.

A 2015 investigative report by Reuters found a network of at least 33 radio stations in 14 countries that obscures CRI as its majority shareholder. A significant portion of the programming on these stations is either produced or provided by CRI, or by media firms CRI controls in the United States, Australia, and Europe.

In February 2020, the United States Department of State designated CRI and other Chinese state-owned media outlets as foreign missions.

CRI has focused on forging commercial partnerships, particularly in Europe, in which its content is broadcast without attribution to CRI. According to a 2023 discourse analysis by the Central European Digital Media Observatory, CRI&#x27;s content steers clear of any criticism of the Chinese government.

<doc id="649586" wikidata="Q728566" url="?curid=649586" title="Euarchonta">
<text>The Euarchonta are a proposed grandorder of mammals: the order Scandentia (treeshrews), and its sister Primatomorpha mirorder, containing the Dermoptera (colugos) and the primates (Plesiadapiformes and descendants).

The term &quot;Euarchonta&quot; (meaning &quot;true rulers&quot;) appeared in 1999, when molecular evidence suggested that the morphology-based Archonta should be trimmed down to exclude Chiroptera. Further DNA sequence analyses supported the Euarchonta hypothesis. Despite multiple papers pointing out that some mitochondrial sequences showed unusual properties (particularly murid rodents and hedgehogs) and were likely distorting the overall tree, and despite earlier studies showing near total congruence of mtDNA-based and nuclear-based trees when such sequences were excluded, some authors continued to produce misleading trees. A study investigating retrotransposon presence/absence data has claimed strong support for Euarchonta. Some interpretations of the molecular data link Primates and Dermoptera in a clade (mirorder) known as Primatomorpha, which is the sister of Scandentia. In some, the Dermoptera are a member of the primates rather than a sister group. Other interpretations link the Dermoptera and Scandentia together in a group called Sundatheria as the sister group of the primates.

Euarchonta and Glires together form the Euarchontoglires, one of the four eutherian clades.

The current hypothesis, based on molecular clock evidence, suggests that the Euarchonta arose in the late Cretaceous period, about 88 million years ago, and diverged 86.2 million years ago into the groups of tree shrews and Primatomorpha. The latter diverged prior to 79.6 million years into the orders of Primates and colugos. The earliest fossil species often ascribed to Euarchonta (&quot;Purgatorius coracis&quot;) dates to the early Paleocene, 65 million years ago, but one study claims it to be a non-placental eutherian. Although it is known that Scandentia is one of the most basal clades of Euarchontoglires, the exact phylogenetic position is not yet considered resolved, and it may be a sister of Glires, Primatomorpha or Dermoptera or to all other Euarchontoglires.

<text>LISA is the USENIX special interest group for system administrators. LISA was known officially as the System Administrators Guild until November 2003; from 2003 to 2010, it was known as SAGE.

In March 2016 it was announced that LISA was being retired.

==Major activities==

* Co-sponsors the annual system administration conference, also known as LISA.
* Hosts several technical and professional mailing lists.
* Provides a job listing service.
* Compiles an annual salary survey of system administrators&#x27; salaries keyed to many variables.
* Publishes a series of short topics booklets in the field of system administration.
* Establishes and promotes a code of ethics for system administrators.
* Supports local user groups.
* Offers an IRC channel.
* Presents an annual award for outstanding contributions to the field of system administration.

==Proposed spinoff==
In June 2004, SAGE was dissolved as a Special Technical Group to prepare for a spin-off from its parent organization, USENIX. On October 27, 2005, the USENIX Board, by a 4–4 vote, failed to approve a motion to progress the separation of SAGE from USENIX, declaring instead that SAGE is better as a suborganization. This contributed to the formation of LOPSA by individuals involved in the aborted spinoff.

<doc id="649616" wikidata="Q2293170" url="?curid=649616" title="Positive-definite function">
<text>In mathematics, a positive-definite function is, depending on the context, either of two types of function.

== Definition 1 ==
Let formula_1 be the set of real numbers and formula_2 be the set of complex numbers.

A function formula_3 is called &quot;positive semi-definite&quot; if for all real numbers &quot;x&quot;1, …, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix

:formula_4

is a positive &quot;semi-&quot;definite matrix.

By definition, a positive semi-definite matrix, such as formula_5, is Hermitian; therefore &quot;f&quot;(−&quot;x&quot;) is the complex conjugate of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)).

In particular, it is necessary (but not sufficient) that

:formula_6

(these inequalities follow from the condition for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2.)

A function is &quot;negative semi-definite&quot; if the inequality is reversed. A function is &quot;definite&quot; if the weak inequality is replaced with a strong (&lt;, &gt; 0).

===Examples===
If formula_7 is a real inner product space, then formula_8, formula_9 is positive definite for every formula_10: for all formula_11 and all formula_12 we have
:formula_13
As nonnegative linear combinations of positive definite functions are again positive definite, the cosine function is positive definite as a nonnegative linear combination of the above functions:
:formula_14

One can create a positive definite function formula_15 easily from positive definite function formula_16 for any vector space formula_17: choose a linear function formula_18 and define formula_19.
Then
:formula_20
where formula_21 where formula_22 are distinct as formula_23 is linear.

===Bochner&#x27;s theorem===
Positive-definiteness arises naturally in the theory of the Fourier transform; it can be seen directly that to be positive-definite it is sufficient for &quot;f&quot; to be the Fourier transform of a function &quot;g&quot; on the real line with &quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) ≥ 0.

The converse result is &quot;Bochner&#x27;s theorem&quot;, stating that any continuous positive-definite function on the real line is the Fourier transform of a (positive) measure.

====Applications====

In statistics, and especially Bayesian statistics, the theorem is usually applied to real functions. Typically, &quot;n&quot; scalar measurements of some scalar value at points in formula_24 are taken and points that are mutually close are required to have measurements that are highly correlated. In practice, one must be careful to ensure that the resulting covariance matrix (an matrix) is always positive-definite. One strategy is to define a correlation matrix &quot;A&quot; which is then multiplied by a scalar to give a covariance matrix: this must be positive-definite. Bochner&#x27;s theorem states that if the correlation between two points is dependent only upon the distance between them (via function &quot;f&quot;), then function &quot;f&quot; must be positive-definite to ensure the covariance matrix &quot;A&quot; is positive-definite. See Kriging.

In this context, Fourier terminology is not normally used and instead it is stated that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the characteristic function of a symmetric probability density function (PDF).

===Generalization===
One can define positive-definite functions on any locally compact abelian topological group; Bochner&#x27;s theorem extends to this context. Positive-definite functions on groups occur naturally in the representation theory of groups on Hilbert spaces (i.e. the theory of unitary representations).

==Definition 2==
Alternatively, a function formula_25 is called &quot;positive-definite&quot; on a neighborhood &quot;D&quot; of the origin if formula_26 and formula_27 for every non-zero formula_28. 

Note that this definition conflicts with definition 1, given above.

In physics, the requirement that formula_26 is sometimes dropped (see, e.g., Corney and Olsen).
