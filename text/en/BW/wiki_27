<text>Charles Poletti (July 2, 1903 – August 8, 2002) was an American lawyer and politician. He became the 46th governor of New York in December 1942, and was the first person entirely of Italian-American ancestry to become the governor of a U.S. state.

Born in Barre, Vermont to Italian immigrants, Poletti graduated from Barre&#x27;s Spaulding High School, Harvard University, and Harvard Law School, and became an attorney in New York City. He became active in the Democratic Party, and served as counsel to the Democratic National Committee, counsel to Governor Herbert H. Lehman, and a justice of the New York State Supreme Court.

Poletti served as lieutenant governor of New York from 1939 to 1942. He lost his bid for reelection in 1942, as did gubernatorial nominee John J. Bennett Jr. In December, Lehman resigned as governor in order to accept an appointment with the United States Department of State; Poletti succeeded to the governorship and served the final month of Lehman&#x27;s term. After leaving office, Poletti served in World War II, initially as a special assistant to the Secretary of War, and then in the United States Army as a Civil Affairs officer responsible for rebuilding and restoring democracy in Italy following its liberation by the Allies.

After the war, Poletti practiced law, served as a member of the New York State Power Authority, and was an executive responsible for planning and overseeing execution of foreign exhibits at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. After retiring, he resided in Florida and Elizabethtown, New York. He died in Florida at age 99, and was buried in Elizabethtown. At the time of his death, he was the earliest-serving living former governor of a U.S. state.

==Early life and education==
Aldo Charles Poletti was born in Barre, Vermont to Dino Poletti (April 28, 1865, Pogno, Italy—February 12, 1922, Barre, Vermont) and Carolina (Gervasini) Poletti. Dino Poletti worked as a stonecutter in a Barre granite quarry.

Poletti intended to manage a bakery after graduating from Spaulding High School in 1920, but was encouraged by his principal to attend college. He attended Harvard University on a scholarship, and worked a variety of part-time jobs to finance his studies, including waiting tables, washing dishes, and tutoring. In 1924, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in economics &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa, and then studied at the University of Rome, the University of Bologna and the University of Madrid. Poletti later served on Harvard&#x27;s Board of Overseers.

==Start of career==
In 1928, Poletti graduated from Harvard Law School with a LL.B. degree, &quot;cum laude&quot;. After passing the bar exam he joined the New York City firm of 1924 Democratic presidential nominee John W. Davis.

In 1928 Poletti was active in the presidential campaign of Governor Alfred E. Smith, and in 1932 he became counsel to the Democratic National Committee. In addition, he was appointed to a seat on the state Board of Social Welfare.

In 1933 Poletti was appointed on Felix Frankfurter&#x27;s recommendation to be counsel to Governor Herbert H. Lehman. Lehman relied heavily on Poletti, asked him to move into the executive mansion, and assigned him tasks from drafting legislation and speeches to lobbying for passage of New Deal measures advocated by the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt.

In 1937 Lehman appointed Poletti to a vacancy as a justice of the New York State Supreme Court, and later that year he was elected to a full 14-year term.

==Election as lieutenant governor and succession to governorship==

In 1938, Poletti was elected lieutenant governor of New York on the Democratic ticket with Lehman.

In 1939 Poletti was elected to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People&#x27;s board of directors. In 1940 he threw out the first pitch at a game between the New York Cubans and the New York Black Yankees, opening the season of the Negro National League with a speech advocating the integration of Major League Baseball.

Poletti, state Attorney General John J. Bennett Jr. and U.S. Senator James M. Mead were candidates for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1942. When party leaders coalesced around Bennett, Poletti withdrew and accepted renomination for lieutenant governor. Bennett defeated Mead for the gubernatorial nomination. The ticket of Bennett and Poletti were defeated in the general election by Thomas E. Dewey and Thomas W. Wallace.

When Lehman resigned as governor on December 3, 1942, to accept appointment as Director of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations for the United States Department of State, Poletti succeeded to the governorship. He served 29 days, the shortest term of any New York governor.

As governor, Poletti controversially pardoned three convicts with ties to labor unions, without consulting New York&#x27;s parole board. These included Alexander Hoffman, a CIO official who had served just eight months of a four-to-eight year prison term for the attempted arson of a non-union laundry firm. In response to adverse media coverage, Poletti stated &quot;I was advised that Hoffman enjoyed an excellent reputation as an honorable citizen [...] I acted honestly and I believe courageously on the basis of the facts submitted to me&quot;.

After leaving office Poletti was appointed special assistant to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. In this position he worked to racially integrate the military.

==World War II==
On Dec. 27, 1942, Poletti broadcast for the Office of War Information a radio address in the Italian language to the Italian people, urging them to &quot;throw out both Hitler and Mussolini.&quot;

In July 1943 Poletti was assigned to serve as a U.S. Army civil affairs officer in Italy, largely because as a first-generation Italian-American who had studied in Italy, was fluent in Italian and had served as a governor, he had an understanding of the local culture and sufficient stature to earn the Sicilian people&#x27;s respect. Initially assigned to assist in restoring civil government in Palermo, he became responsible for rebuilding efforts throughout Sicily.

As the Allies continued to liberate mainland Italy Poletti&#x27;s command followed to restore water and electricity, distribute food and water, and begin returning the formerly fascist country to democracy.

Some sources say that while Poletti served in Sicily his driver and interpreter was Mafia boss Vito Genovese, who had fled New York in the 1930s to escape prosecution for murder. Genovese was allegedly heavily involved in black-market activities with other Sicilian Mafiosi, including Calogero Vizzini. Another Mafia boss, Lucky Luciano, is also alleged to have once described Poletti as &quot;one of our good friends.&quot; Poletti always said he had no connection to Genovese, Luciano, the Mafia, or black market activities. In a 1993 interview for BBC TV, Poletti said, &quot;We had no problems at all with the Mafia. Nobody ever heard of it. While we were there, nobody heard of it. Nobody ever talked about it.&quot; In addition, the stories alleging a Genovese-Poletti connection fail to explain why Poletti would have needed an Italian language interpreter, given his fluency in Italian (including the Sicilian and Neapolitan dialects), Spanish, and German as the result of his heritage, his college studies, a job in his twenties working as a tour guide for college students visiting Europe, and his regular visits to his mother after she began residing in Italy following the death of his father.

==After World War II==
After leaving the Army as a colonel Poletti became the senior partner in a Manhattan law firm, which was reorganized as Poletti, Diamond, Rabin, Freidin &amp; MacKay, and later became known as Poletti, Freidin, Prashker, Feldman and Gartner From May 1946 to June 1947 he carried out an appointment as an arbitrator assigned to resolve labor disputes in New York City&#x27;s clothing industry.

In 1955 Poletti was appointed to the New York State Power Authority, serving until 1960, the period in which the St. Lawrence Project and Niagara Project were built.
From 1960 to 1965 he was the executive responsible for foreign exhibits at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

==Retirement and death==
Poletti died at age 99 in his San Marco Island, Florida home. He was survived by his second wife, Elizabeth, and his children, Charles Poletti, Carla Tidmarsh, and Joanna Todisco. At the time of his death, he was the earliest-serving living former U.S. governor. He was interred at Calkins Cemetery in Elizabethtown, New York.

==Awards and honors==
Poletti received the Legion of Merit for his service in Italy. In 1945 Poletti received the Order of Saint Gregory the Great from Pope Pius XII. In addition, Italy&#x27;s government named him a Knight of the Grand Cross of the Crown of Italy. Poletti was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1948. For his work at the World&#x27;s Fair Poletti received the Order of the Star of Jordan. He also received the Grand Officer of the Order of Saint Agatha of San Marino. The Charles Poletti Power Project (renamed in 1982 to honor him) was located in Astoria, Queens, across the East River from Manhattan in New York City. In 2002 it was scheduled to be closed, and it was shut down in February, 2010.

<doc id="639724" wikidata="Q233684" url="?curid=639724" title="Long-legged buzzard">
<text>The long-legged buzzard (Buteo rufinus) is a bird of prey found widely in several parts of Eurasia and in North Africa. This species ranges from Southeastern Europe down to East Africa to the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The long-legged buzzard is a member of the genus &quot;Buteo&quot;, being one of the larger species therein. This species is simultaneously considered relatively powerful and aggressive for its taxonomic group as well as a relatively sluggish raptor overall. Like most buzzards, it prefers small mammals such as rodents, including gerbils, ground squirrels, voles and rats, also taking reptiles, birds and insects as well as carrion. Adaptable to a variety of habitats, long-legged buzzards may nest on a variety of surfaces, including rocks, cliffs and trees. It is a typical buzzard in its reproductive biology. The long-legged buzzard is widely distributed and appears to be quite stable in population. Therefore, it is considered as Least Concern by the IUCN.

==Description==
===Form and colouring===
This is a large and fairly sturdy &quot;Buteo&quot;. The long-legged buzzard possesses a relatively large bill on a smallish head, long wings and a rather long tail and relatively long legs with powerful feet. The species tends to be considered sluggish, perching openly and prominently and in rather upright positions on a rock, crag or similar vantage point with a good commanding view; they will also perch regularly on artificial raised points such as pylons or utility poles. The long-legged buzzard also often takes to standing on the ground where it walks slowly, often waddling somewhat. This species is highly variable in plumage, with three to four main morphs. The adult pale morph long-legged buzzard has a rather plain pale head, coloured creamy rufous to light sandy with at most a few darker streaks on the crown and a dark line through an eye, usually with a more solidly dark nape. The pale morph possess dark brown upper parts with sandy buff streaks against a more conspicuous sandy-brown mantle and wing coverts with dark feather-eters causing a contrasting effect. The pale morph adult&#x27;s tail is light rufous-orange. The paleness of the head in light morphs continues down to breast, the lower part of which having pencil thin streaks, while the belly down to flanks and trousers is a darker rufous-brown. Meanwhile, the intermediate adult are similar to pale adult but with somewhat richer colour, darker and more rufous upperparts and having a slightly darker and more patterned breast. The rufous morph, arguably separate from the intermediate, is more ochracecous overall and a darker rufous on the dark parts of the plumage against the more contrasting pale head. Some rufous adult long-legged buzzards can show a greyish tail with some banding and at times a darker subterminal band. Dark morph adults are all blackish-brown to black with some whitish streaks on nape. The tail of dark morphs are gray to brown-grey with a broad subterminal band and 7 rather narrow and faint bars although many completely lack the latter bars. Juveniles of the pale, intermediate and rufous morphs are similar to the respective adults of their morphs but tend to possess neater, paler edging above, especially on the tips of the greater and median coverts. Also the juveniles are more streaky about the head and breast with tail going from pale whitish darkening outwards to grey-brown with irregular faint brown bars. Dark morph juveniles are less dark than the adult of that morph, sometimes evidencing a small paler patch on breast. The juvenile dark morph long-legged buzzard&#x27;s tail pattern differs from the dark adult, generally browner than adult with 3 very broad bands and a slightly broader subterminal band but dark morph juvenile tails apparently very variable. Juvenile plumage lasts up to 2–3 years when first breeding occurs. Adults have very dark brown eyes, while the eyes of juveniles are pale grey to greyish yellow turning light brown before darking. The cere and legs are both dull yellow.

In flight, the long-legged buzzards appears as a mid-sized rather broad-bodied raptor. Possessing an almost eagle-like silhouette, it tends to appear with a protruding head with a somewhat heavy bill, long broad wings with fairly straight edges and only slightly tapering hands with rounded five-fingered end. It is relatively long-tailed with the tail having a fairly rounded shape. Juveniles tend to be slimmer looking with narrower wings and more S-shaped trailing edges as well as a somewhat longer tail. Long-legged buzzards tend to fly with comparatively slow, deep beats and to have a relatively slow flight. The species glides with their arms raised and hands more level, wings noticeably kinked at carpals and soars in wide circles with the wings in shallow dihedral. The upward bent tips can enhance their eagle-like appearance. Long-legged buzzards often hover frequently and for extended periods. In the flight, the whitish based orangey tail often looks all white at a distance and to stand out in its paleness against the dark rear body and the rear wings. The primary coverts and many greater coverts are blackish in adult long-legged buzzards with the greater coverts pale tipped. Adults are dark grey on the flight feathers with blackish bars radiating outwards on wingtips and on the trailing edges. The underwing coverts are usually lightly streaked with rufous in pale adults, while intermediate adult has a stronger contrast from pale head and breast to darker, browner upperbody and wing coverts, breast and wing linings. The flying rufous adult tends to look more uniform above with colours varying from ochre to tawny to darker rufous brown and to possess richer coloured darker parts, with the tail very variable in rufous morph. Dark adult in flight may appear with or without a pale nape patch. Dark morph long-legged buzzards above evidence pale bases to primaries, some less dark individuals showing slight contrast of brown-tinged wing coverts against blacker carpal areas with grayish cast to secondaries but tail more obviously pale and greyer and variable. Below dark morph adult striking contrasting from dark body and underwing coverts against pale flight feathers. Juvenile long-legged buzzards are evidently more streaky in pale, intermediate and rufous morphs with differing wing shape. Juveniles of the 3 morphs have comparatively uniform secondaries above with a paler based hand, the inner four primaries being thinly barred, the whitish tail becoming greyer brown and appear indistinctly barred distally. The trailing wing edges are more diffuse, greyer and narrower than on adults with a dark line often evidence along greater coverts. Dark morph juveniles in flight even more uniform above without darker trailing edges above and below greyish secondaries are much duskier-looking with broader but diffuse barring and often markedly wide trailing edges, this increasing the contrast against the dark tipped whitish hand.

===Size===

This is one of the largest species of the &quot;Buteo&quot; genus. Only two species, the upland buzzard (&quot;Buteo hemilasius&quot;) and the ferruginous hawk (&quot;Buteo regalis&quot;), notably exceed the average and maximum weight of nominate long-legged buzzards or attain similar wingspans, but several other species of the genus broadly overlap in body size with the long-legged buzzard (for instance the Galapagos, rufous-tailed and red-tailed hawks and the Augur, rough-legged and jackal buzzards). Length can range from and wingspan from . Mean wingspan may be about , with wingspans surely rivaling the upland buzzard as the greatest of all &quot;Buteo&quot;. The long-legged buzzard displays the typical size sexual dimorphism in favor of females, as they may be to 15% larger and can average up to 30% heavier. The mean body mass of males is , amongst a sample of 8 with weights ranging from , while the mean was in females, in a sample of 11 ranging from . Meanwhile, the weights of migrating long-legged buzzards migrating in Eilat were in mature buzzards and in second-year juveniles. The measurements of live Indian long-legged buzzards were with slighter lengths of and wingspans of . Among standard measurements, nominate subspecies males attain a wing chord of while the female attains a wing chord of . In males the tail may measure while the female may measure . In tarsal length, males may measure while females attain . In the nominate race, the culmen from the cere is in both sexes, with an average of in migrants at Eilat. Mature migrants in Eilat measured from , averaging , on the enlarged hallux-claw.

===Identification===

Paler individuals of the long-legged buzzard are typically reasonably distinctive but their highly variable plumage leads to mistaken identity. The main confusion is with the even more variable common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;), principally of the steppe subspecies, which breeds and migrates in often similar areas. Steppe buzzards are told apart by various features of plumage, i.e. darker head and chest with a contrasting paler breast band, fully barred and darker uppertails, less distinct carpal patch both above and below, more contrasting wing lining with median coverts paler, with the greater covert darkest. Due to much variation in plumage, steppe buzzards often not reliably distinguished and in distant sightings best told apart by their smaller size and differing proportions. The steppe buzzard is distinctly smaller, of more compact build and possess a distinctly shorter wings and tail than nominate long-legged buzzards. Furthermore, the steppe buzzard has a more pronounced head but less protruding bill and flies with faster but stiffer and less flexible beats. Furthermore, steppe buzzards tend to fly with flatter wings in a glide and less pronounced dihederal without tips pointed up. Dark morphs of the respective species are so similar that they must be told by size, proportions and flight actions. Especially hard to tell apart from the steppe buzzard is the smaller North African subspecies. In Asia the long-legged buzzard is similar to the upland buzzard, which averages slightly bigger in size but is somewhat narrower winged. Typically the upland species has a large white patch on the hand above, with a uniform looking greyish white tail (with at most 2-3 dark bars only visible at close range), darker, more earthen brown on the breast and thighs and lacks the long-legged&#x27;s typical warm, rufous tones. In dark morph upland buzzards, though they may manifest some darker ground colour on under secondaries and sometimes show pale U on breast but otherwise almost identical in appearance to dark morph long-legged buzzards. The only other &quot;Buteo&quot; that can be potentially confused with the long-legged buzzard is the migrant rough-legged buzzard (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;) which is similar in size, proportions and flight behaviour, extending to hovering (however the rough-legged is marginally smaller in size with shorter legs and a shorter bill). The rough-legged buzzard should be told apart from the long-legged by having a distinctive white based tail with a broad dark subterminal band as well as fully feathered legs, Juvenile rough-legged buzzards lack the dark underwing diagonals of many juvenile long-legged buzzards. The long-legged buzzard is potentially confusable with other medium or large unrelated species of raptor from outside of the &quot;Buteo&quot;, including multiple species of small to mid-sized eagle and two species of honey buzzard. However, all of these usually tend to have a number of distinctive morphological, especially the proportion and shapes of their wings, head and tail and flight actions, as well as plumage features that tend to easily separate them from even the most similarly hued and sized of long-legged buzzards.

===Voice===
The long-legged buzzard&#x27;s voice is not well studied nor is it believed to be particularly vocal. The species is known to sometimes calls on display but it is less vocal than common buzzard. The call is similar to the latter species but the notes are shorter and slightly higher. The long-legged buzzard&#x27;s commonest call is a short &quot;mew&quot;. It is also sometimes transcribed as a &quot;kyaaah&quot; and drops in pitch at the end of the brief 0.5-0.8 second call. It is said that compared to the common buzzard, the calls of the long-legged buzzard are &quot;less squealing&quot; and more &quot;gull-like&quot;. A long-legged buzzard leaving its nest in Morocco just after sunrise was said to have uttered a repeated &quot;ar&quot; note, shorter fuller and apparently lower than the comparable call of a common buzzard.

==Distribution and habitat==
The long-legged buzzard inhabits arid areas of northern Africa, southeastern Europe, west and central Asia east to China, and down to as far as central India. The farthermost western part of their breeding range is in west Africa, in Western Sahara, extreme northern Mauritania, much of Morocco west to northern Algeria (spottily elsewhere in the nation), Tunisia and northern Libya (mainly northwestern parts). Long-legged buzzards occur accidentally in several other parts of Africa. In mainland Europe, they mainly nest in the southeastern region. Nesting long-legged buzzards have been known in eastern Hungary, central and eastern Ukraine, southern Moldova, southern and far eastern Romania, southern Serbia and more broadly in Bulgaria and somewhat so in northern Greece. Recent sightings indicate that there is a small population in the Apulian region of south-eastern Italy. Similarly, increasing records of long-legged buzzards are known in far southern Spain with the first nesting occurring in Gibraltar in 2009. The recent colonization Europe due to the climate in southern Europe becoming more suitable for this species. Vagrant accidental long-legged buzzards have been documented several times in many parts of Europe, including Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia. Out of Europe in the eastern Mediterranean or Asia Minor, the long-legged buzzard is one of the most continuously found and abundant breeding resident raptors, being distributed throughout all of Turkey, Cyprus, Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The range continues into southwestern Russia up to about Saratov and Orenburg.

It is also widely and regularly distributed through much of the Middle East, residing almost throughout Syria, Lebanon, Israel, as well as the northern central parts of both Iraq and Iran. More uncommonly the breeding ranges extends into Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The range continues almost throughout Central Asia, residing in essentially all of Turkmenistan (including broadly along the Caspian Sea coast), Uzbekistan, all but the northern stretches of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and northern and central Afghanistan. The breeding range discontinues in Northwestern China but isolated breeding was documented in the Kashmir region, perhaps straddling both Pakistan and India. During times of passage, long-legged buzzards have been seen more broadly in areas such as the Arabian Peninsula, southern Iraq, western China and northeast Africa, with those that breed in Europe, Russia and Central Asia often departing their breeding grounds for the winter. The wintering areas of migrating long-legged buzzards extend through much of lower Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent including southern Afghanistan, much of Pakistan and northern India through to Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Seldom vagrants have been recorded to as south as Sri Lanka, northern Burma and the Andaman Islands. Less consistent wintering populations may live from central Sudan and Eritrea, northern South Sudan, much of Ethiopia, into far northeastern Uganda and central Kenya, seldom into far northern Tanzania.

===Habitat===

The long-legged buzzard inhabits open, uncultivated areas, with high bushes, trees, cliffs or hillocks are favoured as nesting areas as well as access to freshwater. The species normally lives in steppe, semi-desert and desert edge, barren rocky landscapes, dry shrubland and sometimes sea coasts. More irregularly, the species will adapt to woodland as long as plentiful openings are available. As a whole slightly hilly plains are ideal nesting areas. In a study in Iran, 41% of long-legged buzzards were on open plains with low vegetation, 29% on plains with somewhat taller vegetation, 12% were in mountain areas and 18% were in cultivated lands. While long-legged buzzards predominantly forage in wildlands, they are also adaptable to cultivations, pastures, village outskirts and sometimes even heavily farmed areas. Grasslands are often predominantly utilized during winter. Those wintering in the Indian subcontinent largely use similar arid open plains, semi-deserts and cultivated areas but perhaps surprisingly are considered a characteristic wintering raptor of dry mixed forests with open glades and barren hill slopes. In the Indian subcontinent, the species may often be seen using a variety of perches including bushes, hedges, &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;, sand dunes, haystacks, mounds and power poles. The North African and Arabian race may reportedly show a strong preference for open wooded and/or rocky areas but has been reported in a similarly broad amount of habitats as the nominate subspecies. The species may occur from sea-level up to about in Europe, but in Asia uncommonly lives in mountains at elevations of up to or even with migrants recorded to . Younger birds disperse north of breeding grounds and there are records from Northern Europe. The breeding population in Greece is around 60 pairs. Reforestation in the Judean Hills in Israel and the West Bank is increasing potential interspecific conflict for other raptors in the vicinity.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The long-legged buzzard is a member of the Buteoninae subfamily, of origin in the Americas. The genus &quot;Buteo&quot;, with nearly 30 species (one of the most diverse genera of diurnal raptors), radiated through Eurasia and Africa, relatively recently in the subfamily&#x27;s evolutionary history. The most similar extant species and once thought both of as conspecific and to be part of a superspecies is the upland buzzard. However, a genetic study indicated that the long-legged and upland buzzards do not bear a strong genetic relation and the species are by and large allopatric. The upland buzzard abuts the range of long-legged buzzards from Tarbagatay to northwestern Mongolia south to Dzungaria. Evidence has been found of extensive hybridization between the two species. Although the common buzzard is not considered closely related either, hybridization has also been recently appearing between long-legged buzzards and common buzzards in Gibraltar, as well as in the Great Hungarian Plains. Additionally, little-known buzzards (once thought to be part of the common buzzard) living on the respective islands of Socotra and Cape Verde have been found to be more closely related to the long-legged buzzard if not necessarily conspecific.

===Subspecies===

There are two subspecies recognised:

* &quot;Buteo rufinus rufinus&quot;: With the exceptional of Arabia and perhaps the southern Middle East, the nominate race comprises all Eurasian breeding long-legged buzzards, being distributed from The Balkans east to Mongolia and India; winters in several areas of South Asia and Africa. All prior descriptions primarily refer to the nominate subspecies
* &quot;Buteo rufinus cirtensis&quot;: Northern Africa from Mauritania east to Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula, with some evidence that they can reach far southern Israel and the subspecies additionally penetrated Europe in the Gibraltar area. It has been long hypothesized that this may be a distinct species but extreme variations of both races and minimal differences in behaviour, voice and morphology have prevented said species recognition. Unlike some populations of &quot;B. r. rufinus&quot;, this subspecies is entirely residential and is not known to migrate. This subspecies tends to be notably smaller than the nominate long-legged buzzard, however evidence indicates that &quot;B. r. cirtensis&quot; breeding in Arabia and perhaps southern Israel may be larger than the African birds of the races. Wing chord of this race measures in males and in females. Additionally, tail length measures in males and in females while tarsus length is in both sexes. One &quot;B. r. cirtensis&quot; in Israel weighed . Furthermore &quot;B. r. cirtensis&quot; tends to be paler overall than nominate long-legged buzzards, with a somewhat more strongly contrasting rufous belly. It is said that this race lacks a dark morph despite some confusion on the issue.

==Migration==

While the North African race is largely sedentary some short-range dispersal, wandering occasionally to Iberia, while one moved to Senegal in October, rarely southward movements occur, such as to Burkina Faso and Lagos. The nominate race more or less residential in the southern part of the breeding range but almost wholly migratory in north and east of range. Autumn migration commences any time from late August to throughout September. Data from intermediate areas such as Lebanon indicates that autumn passage can extend occasionally into November. Unlike common buzzards, long-legged buzzards tend to migrate singly or in small flocks. Quite small numbers tend to be recorded at main migratory hawk-watches. For example, 1,816 at Suez from September to early November in 1981. In the south Red Sea coast at Bab-el-Mandeb the total number of long-legged buzzards is up to around 130 each autumn. The species normally reaches the Indian subcontinent by about September or October and leaves by about March. Corresponding arrival and departure dates as in the Indian subcontinent were documented for wintering long-legged buzzards in Korea. A majority of the species winter in the eastern Mediterranean, i.e. Greece, Asia Minor through Middle East and Arabia to southern Tibet and northern India, as well as elsewhere in Asia. Central Asian areas may show a mixture of migratory populations, staging grounds and some wintering buzzards. Moderate numbers of long-legged buzzards tend to be documented in Africa, mostly in the Nile Valley in Sudan and the species seldom ranges south of the Sahara but migrants have been documented in both west Africa and east Africa as vagrants. Spring returns flights occur from late February on for about a month and a half, peaking in the 2nd half of March with even fewer typically seen at major migratory sites than in the fall. For example, only about 105 are recorded throughout an average spring in Eilat. Breeding usually already commenced by March-mid April to May, even for birds breeding in the northerly part of the range.

==Dietary biology==

Although frequently described as sluggish, the long-legged buzzard appears by most accounts to be a fairly active and powerful predator. This species often hunts by pounces on unwary prey from a variety of lookout perches. Long-legged buzzards, like many &quot;Buteo&quot;, regularly still-hunt, using tallish or high perch sites or mounds, spending long periods of time scanning the ground. Regular perch sites while hunting may include power poles, pylons, powerlines, boulders, rocky outcrops and dead and sometimes live trees. They also will watch for prey whilst standing on the ground, sometimes right by the entrance of a prey&#x27;s burrow. No less often, they may hunt on the wing from hovering or active flight. During hunting on the wing they often hang in the air, at up to about above the ground, for sometimes several minutes, before dropping steepwise and making a short stoop. It is likely that the habitat being used and dictating availability of perches or sloping land from which to watch the ground dictate the variations in hunting modes seen in this species. Often the preferred hunting habitat is fairly open including upland steppe, arid semi-desert and cultivated fields. Occasionally they&#x27;ve been recorded in small towns as engaging in &quot;stampeding&quot; of pigeons resting on ledges, crevices and under the eaves of old buildings by suddenly flying up using the cover of the buildings and catching them as they rise. Long-legged buzzards are known to visit jungle or grass fires in order to capture displaced prey, often engaging in this along with other raptors. The long-legged buzzard has a fairly typical diet for a &quot;Buteo&quot;, having a generalist opportunistic diet overall, but with a preference for small mammal prey. Somewhat more so than many &quot;Buteo&quot; species, long-legged buzzards tends to take a great number of reptiles as prey, from fairly small to quite large sizes as well. More secondary prey types include birds, insects, other invertebrates and very rarely other types of vertebrates. The dietary biology of the long-legged buzzard is rather less well-documented than that of common buzzard, even in the European portion of their range, still nearly 200 prey species have been described for it. Staple prey, i.e. vertebrates, for long-legged buzzards taken generally fall in body mass between and . Scavenging for carrion is not uncommon in long-legged buzzards, having been reported extensively on dog (&quot;Canis lupus familaris&quot;) carcasses in Romania, however carrion seems to be only regularly ingested during the non-breeding season.

In one of the westernmost dietary studies, in Ukraine, 450 mammalian prey remains found, with 565 total prey items (5.3% birds, 8.3% reptiles, 0.2% amphibians and 6.5% beetles). Main prey here were common vole (&quot;Microtus arvalis&quot;), averaging an estimated and constituting 48.4% of the diet by number and 12.59% of the biomass and the greater mole-rat (&quot;Spalax microphthalmus&quot;) and Podolsk mole-rat (&quot;Spalax zemni&quot;), both averaging an estimated and collectively comprising 22% of the diet by number and 49.2% of the biomass. Other important prey were speckled ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus suslicus&quot;) with the larger mammalian prey being very young European hare (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;) at and adult European hamsters (&quot;Cricetus cricetus&quot;) at , on average. Different Ukrainian study found a predominance of greater mole-rats in the diet, with these constituting 44.5% of the diet by number, rodents altogether making up 77.5% of the foods. Meanwhile, the diet in this second Ukrainian study showed an unusual profusion of bird prey, making up 22.3%. The diet in the Hungarian Hortobágy Plains were found surprisingly among 94 prey items that 69.1% of the diet was beetles, with the European ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus citellus&quot;) most frequent mammal at 19.1%. Elsewhere in Hungary, European ground squirrels were dominant in the diet in Dobruja while outside in Slovakia&#x27;s Eastern Slovak Flat, the diet almost entirely based upon common vole but only reportedly when the voles were at the peak of their population cycle. Further study on the Great Hungarian Plains seems to reinforce the importance as elsewhere in eastern Europe of common voles and European hamsters in the diet of long-legged buzzards. In southeastern Bulgaria, among 189 prey items, &quot;Microtus&quot; species made up 22.2% of the diet, European ground squirrels were at 18.6%, brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) at 10.6%, European water vole (&quot;Arvicola terrestris&quot;) at 8.5% and Balkan green lizard (&quot;Lacerta trilineata&quot;) at 4.76%. In Bulgaria, 68.8% of the diet was mammalian, 13.23% reptilian, 9% avian, 7.41% arthropods and other vertebrates the remaining balance, with prey varying in size from invertebrates weighing a fraction of a gram to mammals of up to such as young European hare and non-native muskrats (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;). Long-legged buzzards in northeastern Greece were found to be highly reliant on the European ground squirrel which comprised 21.2% of 268 prey items there. Most other prey were largely unidentified but included Orthoptera (10.8%) &quot;Scolopendra&quot; species (10.8%), snake sp. (8.2%), &quot;Lacerta sp&quot;. (7.83%) and common voles (7.46%).

The long-legged buzzard population in Georgia was found to live off of very small mammals. For instance, in Kvernaki Ridge, of 223 prey items, the main prey identified to species was social vole (&quot;Microtus socialis&quot;) (at 27.35%) and house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;) (at 7.17%), followed by assorted unidentified rodents (nearly 15% of diet) and &quot;Lacerta sp&quot;. (7.17%) and Caucasian agama (&quot;Paralaudakia caucasia&quot;) (4.93%). In the uplands of Ninotsminda, 244 prey items were recorded to feed mostly on unidentified small rodents, especially voles, as well as larger European water vole (7.78%) and identified common voles (5.74%). In both study areas of Georgia, mammals comprised just over 59% of the total remains, unidentified insects comprised 18.4% and 22.5% of prey numbers, birds 6.3% and 13.5% of the diet and reptiles 16.2% and 4.52% of the diets, respectively. It appears in Armenia that their diet was very reptile based, mostly small to medium-sized lizards but even the remains of a Greek tortoise (&quot;Testudo graeca&quot;) were reported. On the isle of Cyprus, 559 prey total prey items were found by combination of observation, prey remains and pellets. The main prey here by far were black rats (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) at 46.3% of the diet and starred agama (&quot;Stellagama stellio&quot;) at 30.4%. Overall in Cyprus, 49.1% of the diet was mammalian, reptiles more than 40%. Young rats, agamas and Schneider&#x27;s skinks (&quot;Eumeces schneiderii&quot;) were well represented in the Cyprus diet, rendering an estimated rough two-thirds of the diet to consist of small prey weighing or less. However, a not inconsiderable amount of prey weighing in the range of were taken including young European hares, large whipsnake (&quot;Dolichophis caspius&quot;) (at 5% of the diet by number) and birds such as chukar (&quot;Alectoris chukar&quot;) and common wood pigeon (&quot;Columbus palumbus&quot;).

Accompanying food studies of the long-legged buzzards were conducted in the Israeli Judean Hills. Among 1239 total prey items from 32 nests here, the primary prey appeared to be Schneider&#x27;s skinks at 16.3% and starred agamas at 14.6%, with an old study finding rock doves or feral pigeons (&quot;Columbus livia&quot;) the most significant at 19.6% of 561 prey items (pigeons were 10.7% amongst the 1239 prey items). Overall the Judean Hills long-legged buzzards preferred reptiles, at 47.2% of the foods, and birds, at 32.2%, rather strongly over mammals, 18.3%, which is not unexpected in the region&#x27;s semi-desert environment. The predominant prey in Jordan was reportedly the fat sand rat (&quot;Psammomys obsesus&quot;) followed by again the starred agama and generally appeared not dissimilar from the diet of the species on Cyprus. On the Arabian Peninsula, long-legged buzzards were reported to feed mostly on the largish &quot;Uromastyx&quot; lizards, but also took hares, birds, and carrion. In northern Iran&#x27;s Khar Turan National Park, 34 remains seemed to be predominantly represented by unidentified hares, occasionally supplemented by birds, tortoises and smaller mammals like &quot;Meriones&quot; and &quot;Gerbillus&quot; species. In southwestern Iran, 100 estimated prey items found by combination of prey remains, pellets and video recordings. The main prey were Caucasian squirrels (&quot;Sciurus anomalus&quot;) at 29.85% by number, 39.4% by biomass (with an estimated mean mass of and mature adult agamas such as brilliant ground agamas (&quot;Trapelus agilis&quot;), large-scaled agama (&quot;Laudakia nupta&quot;) (both estimated at when taken and small-scaled agama (&quot;Paralaudakia microlepis&quot;), these three comprising 30.3% of the diet collectively and 36.5% of the prey biomass. Several snakes like spotted whipsnakes (&quot;Hemorrhois ravergieri&quot;) were also taken frequently here.

While the diet is reasonably well studied in the European, eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern areas, farther east the diet is largely incidentally known, from secondary observations and rarely quantitatively analyzed (while the North African populations are almost entirely unknown in terms of dietary biology). In the East Kazakhstan Region, two long-legged buzzard nests were found to primarily contain the remains of contained the remains of Tamarisk gerbil (&quot;Meriones tamariscinus&quot;) and red-cheeked ground squirrels (&quot;Spermiphilus erythrogenys&quot;). A study in the Kalmykia region of Russia found that about 100 prey items of long-legged buzzards consisted of by diverse prey and less based in small mammals or lizards than other regions. The most frequent identified prey here were unidentified larks, at 18% of the diet by number and 4.7% by biomass, while very young juvenile European hare, at estimated mean of body mass, were second in number, at 9%, and primary in biomass at 21.8%. Other significant prey here were social voles, at 9% by number as well, and adult rooks (&quot;Corvus frugilegus&quot;), at a mean mass of comprising 15.7% of the biomass. In northeastern China, the diet was fairly well studied, albeit in a somewhat small study. Of 50 prey items, here great gerbils (&quot;Rhombomys opimus&quot;) led the diet at 48%, followed by Tartar sand boa (&quot;Eryx miliaris&quot;) (18%), cape hare (&quot;Lepus capensis&quot;) (6%), goitered gazelle (&quot;Gazella subgutturosa&quot;) (6%) (likely but not certainly taken to the nest as carrion) and Mongolian finch (&quot;Bucanetes mongolicus&quot;) (6%). Overall mammals made 60% of the diet, reptiles 22% and birds 18%. The diet in the Indian subcontinent is quite diverse, with prey often observed to be taken consisting of small mammals, being up to 85% of the diet, with primary prey often being Indian desert jird (&quot;Meriones hurrianae&quot;) in arid areas and voles and pikas in highland areas. Lizards are significant, especially Indian spiny-tailed lizard (&quot;Saara hardwickii&quot;) and agamas, as well as snakes and various other prey.

===Interspecific relationships===

The long-legged buzzard occurs over a broad range across Eurasia. They often co-exist in several areas with the steppe subspecies of the common buzzard. Little is known how the two co-exist, but the long-legged buzzard is known to be more of a bird of open and rocky habitat rather than wooded edge, nesting often on or about rocks rather than in trees. Both the common and long-legged buzzards are often highly opportunistic but the long-legged buzzard is liable to take a variety of small mammals such as mole-rats, hamsters, ground squirrels, rats and various reptiles such as lizards and to be generally less strongly reliant on voles as prey. It was documented in northeastern Greece that the two species often engaged in interspecific conflicts around the nests, with the common buzzard comprising the largest percent of aggressive interactions documented for long-legged buzzards, at 10 out of 47 such interactions. In their distribution, long-legged buzzards often share relatively open, sunny and partially arid habitats and prey extensively with a number of other raptors, from smaller, weaker harriers of about three species to larger more powerful eagles such as eastern imperial eagles (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;) and steppe eagle (&quot;Aquila nipalensis&quot;), as well as quite often saker falcons (&quot;Falco cherrug&quot;) It was documented that the long-legged buzzard was the most significant nest constructor for nesting saker falcons in Kazakhstan, with the falcons usually using old or alternate buzzard nests. Nesting habitat often coincides with and prey is somewhat similar to the Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;), as in Bulgaria where they can even nest in the same groves, but the much larger eagle-owl can seldom be said to compete directly given its nocturnality. Evidence in the Judean Foothills shows that the long-legged buzzard is competing with the short-toed snake eagle (&quot;Circateus gallicus&quot;) there. Although there were differences in the diet, the short-toed taking more snakes, the long-legged buzzard more lizards and birds, with partitioning in primary hunting times, the long-legged buzzard fared well in interactions being the swifter and often more aggressive raptor than the somewhat larger eagle.

The long-legged buzzard appears to occupy an intermediate position in the food guild of medium to large diurnal raptors in steppe, meadows, plateaus and coastal areas, in keeping with its body size (which is large for a buzzard but smaller than many species of eagle that it is obligated to share habitats with). There is little information on their position except for their place in the food chain. Their main predator appears to be Eurasian eagle-owls. Although no predation acts have been documented in Bulgaria, in many other mutual parts of the range, long-legged buzzards have turned up in the diet of the powerful eagle-owls. Other larger raptors birds are known to occasionally hunt down long-legged buzzards as well. These have been documented to include eastern imperial eagles, steppe eagles and Bonelli&#x27;s eagles (&quot;Aquila fasciata&quot;). A few raptorial birds have also turned up at different times in the diet of long-legged buzzards as well and, compared to the common buzzard, the lesser studied long-legged buzzards may be more prone to interspecific killings from the number reported despite their being relatively few prey studies. Among the raptorial birds documented as apparent prey of long-legged buzzards are Eurasian sparrowhawks (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;), levant sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter brevipes&quot;), short-toed snake eagle, barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;), European scops owl (&quot;Otus scops&quot;), little owl (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;), long-eared owl (&quot;Asio otus &quot;), short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;), common kestrel (&quot;Falco tinnunculus&quot;) and red-footed falcon (&quot;Falco vespertinus&quot;). Mammalian carnivores are also known to be occasional prey for long-legged buzzards as well, including least weasels (&quot;Mustela nivalis &quot;) and marbled polecat (&quot;Vormela peregusna&quot;) as well as, although these are more likely taken either while young or as carrion, red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and European wildcats (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;).

==Breeding==

The long-legged buzzard is, as is typical for &quot;Buteo&quot; and accipitrids, usually rather solitary outside of the pair bond. However, occasionally forms very loose breeding groups, at times several as close as or in the same crag. It is also slightly gregarious sometimes in passage in small groups, rarely traveling in large flocks. The long-legged buzzard&#x27;s aerial display similar but less well documented than that of the common buzzard. They tend to engage in mutual high circling, with both sexes diving at each other. Additionally, an impressive sky dance is sometimes undertaken by the male in which he circles before plunging on part closed wings, swooping up again, after which he may engage in tilting or even looping the loop at the zenith, drops nearly vertically, repeating dance one or more times. Territories are fairly large for long-legged buzzards. In Ukraine, there was an estimated per pair occupancy of about while in Kazakhstan, in an area of , there an estimated mean of 2.8 nesting pairs.

The breeding season of the long-legged buzzard can fall at variable times of the years. In Europe, it tends to breed from March to July. Similarly phenology of breeding is reported in Armenia and even in Iraq. In the United Arab Emirates, a nest with eggs which must have been laid in December was reported, with pair occupancy lasting to at least March. In Morocco, nuptial displays begin in January and February, peaking in March, with egg laying usually from March to April in the northern part of the country and from February to April in southern part. Elsewhere in North Africa, breeding seems to fall somewhat earlier from February to March, with possibly fledging completed by the month of May. The nesting period in Pakistan is about March to July, but records of eggs as late as June may refer to second or replacement clutches being laid. The nest is a large pile of sticks and branches, typically lined with green leaves, twigs, straw and wool. Nests are fairly large structures, averaging around in diameter, as in Bulgaria and Kazakhstan, respectively, but could easily exceed across in some cases. The average depth was , ranging in Bulgaria and Kazakhstan from in depth. 

Often this species nests are located on a cliff ledge, crag or low rocks, often in fairly shaded relative to the often sunny environs. In Kazakhstan, more than 75% of 53 nests were on such ledges or in granite niches, with a further 11% on power poles, 8% in trees and 4% on high hills less frequently nest ground, in a tree or steep slope or old large bird nest. In Cyprus, of 22 nests, only 1 was in a tree, while the rest were a variety of cliffs from sea cliffs to mountainous areas of around elevation. All known nests in northwestern China as well as in southwestern Iran were located on cliffs. In Bulgaria, in the absence of natural rocks, the long-legged buzzards largely adapted to nesting alongside manmade quarries rather than use trees. Nesting locations were exceptional then in Ukraine where most (85.7%) were built in oak trees, with one additionally placed in a pear tree. Data from the Volga region of Russia also suggests that tree nesting is common for the species there, especially in &quot;Malus&quot; apple trees. Additionally, the few known nests from Pakistan have appeared to be located in trees such as &quot;Abies&quot; firs or junipers. Some nests along the perimeter of old buildings have been documented as well. At times the long-legged buzzard will use the old nest of another species, apparently largely ravens such as common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) or brown-necked raven (&quot;Corvus ruficollis&quot;). Nests are frequently reused in subsequent years and added to over time.

The long-legged buzzard may lay a variably sized clutch. Typically 2 to 4 eggs are laid but from 1 to 6 egg clutches have been documented. The average clutch size in Ukraine was 2.7, in a sample of 8. The same clutch size mean was reported in Cyprus as well. The average clutch size in North Africa was reported (in a sample of 57) as 2.54. The clutch size in northwestern Iran averaged 3. In northwestern China, the mean clutch size was 3.3. The eggs are slightly rough, oval and largely whitish with a yellowish tint and a few wart like projections, with indistinct gray-brown to reddish brown markings, which tend to fade at the pointer tip of the oval. The average egg sizes in Ukraine, Armenia and northwestern China were , and , respectively. Egg heights ranged from and diameter ranged from , while in Armenia eggs weighed on average and in China they weighed . Incubation appears to last for about 28 to 30 days.

Upon hatching, the young are expectedly semi-altricial. The brood size averages about 2.3. The chicks initially have fine white down at first and then develop a second down coat with white to creamy white. The chicks are brooded considerably, especially by their mother for about 30 days, after which she may resume hunting. Fledgling of the chicks may occur at between 40 and 46 days of age for the young buzzards. The dependence period after they leave the nest can be relatively prolonged for a temperate-zone raptor, reaching perhaps a month in total. Breeding success rates are relatively quite poorly known in long-legged buzzards, with many sources failing to find extensive data on this topic. Data from Cyprus shows the nesting success varying greatly, perhaps based on food supplies, with an annual mean success rate varying from 46% to 93%. In northwestern China, the mean number of fledglings per nest was 0.7 while the mean fledged from successful nests was 1.4. The maximum estimated mean productivity per pair in Israel was about 0.96.

==Status==

Some declines have been reported in western Russia and generally the long-legged buzzard may be somewhat less numerous than they once were in the more western parts of the range. On the other hand, since the 1990s, there have been recent increases reported in Europe, mainly Bulgaria, where expanding population and post-breeding dispersals have enlarged their range in Hungarian steppes. In the 1990s, the estimated population in the Western Palearctic was between 5000 and 15,000 pairs while by 2015 the estimated population where was 11,800-19,200 pairs breeding pairs. The following estimates show from the smaller numbers of the 1990s to the generally higher estimated numbers by 2015. There are an estimated 800-1500 pairs nesting in western Russia, 200-750 pairs occurring in Bulgaria and about 60-300 pairs in Greece and 50 pairs in Ukraine, with fewer in Albania and a few other countries. Europe contains less than a quarter of the global population and the declines from historic numbers were still over 30%, so the long-legged buzzard is considered locally a Vulnerable species in Europe. Furthermore, about 500 pairs are estimated to nest in Israel, as recorded after slight population depletions due largely to pesticide use in the 1950s. The Turkish population is ample at 1000-10,000 pairs, probably 3000-6000; with about 1000-2500 in Azerbaijan. Additionally, numbers are considered unchanged in Armenia. There are less well known populations and trends in North Africa, with perhaps 400 pairs in Tunisia, 1000 or more pairs in Morocco. A small number nest in the Arabian Peninsula. Arabia has thought to experience a 5% decline in long-legged buzzard populations, perhaps due to overly extensive conversion of habitat to farmland and stone quarries. Saudi Arabia holds about 600 pairs, Oman and Yemen both about 100 pairs and the United Arab Emirates about 5 pairs. Fewer figures still are available from Asia, where the species is considered uncommon to rare in Pakistan, slightly more common in Kashmir and variously rare to uncommon in northwestern China and Turkmenia. Good habitat and strong circumstantial evidence of strong continuous breeding pairs in Central Asia has led to a projected fairly ample but poorly documented population in this region.

<text>The Summit League, or The Summit, is an NCAA Division I intercollegiate athletic conference with its membership mostly located in the Midwestern United States, from Minnesota in the east, to the Dakotas, Nebraska and Colorado to the West, and Missouri and Oklahoma to the South. Founded as the Association of Mid-Continent Universities in 1982, it rebranded as the Mid-Continent Conference in 1989, then again as the Summit League on June 1, 2007. The league headquarters are in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

The membership currently consists of nine full members plus seven associate members. The most recent change in the core conference membership is the 2021 arrival of the University of St. Thomas, which began an unprecedented transition from NCAA Division III to Division I. A year earlier, the University of Missouri–Kansas City returned as a full member after a seven-year absence with the new athletic identity of the Kansas City Roos, while Purdue University Fort Wayne left for the Horizon League. A total of 32 schools have been full members; the last charter member remaining in the league, Western Illinois University, left for the Ohio Valley Conference on July 1, 2023 in most sports, with men&#x27;s soccer playing one more season before leaving at the conclusion of the fall 2023 season.

== History ==
=== Early Days ===
The conference can trace its roots back to 1978, when the Mid-Continent Athletic Association was founded as a football-only conference playing in Division II at the time. Its inaugural members were the University of Akron, Eastern Illinois University, University of Northern Iowa, Northern Michigan University, Western Illinois University, and Youngstown State University; Wayne State University had also expressed interest in joining, but ultimately never did. Akron left after the 1979 season, while Northern Michigan and Youngstown State left the following year; they were replaced by Southwest Missouri State (now known as Missouri State University) in 1981. The 1981 season also saw the conference as a whole move from Division II to Division I-AA; this would be the conference&#x27;s final season under the name of the Mid-Continent Athletic Association.

=== Foundation ===
The new association was officially created on June 18, 1982, at the O&#x27;Hare Hilton Hotel in Chicago, Illinois as the Association of Mid-Continent Universities (or AMCU or AMCU-8, pronounced Am-cue), which it was known as until 1989. Covering all men&#x27;s sports now in addition to football, the new conference consisted of current MCAA members Eastern Illinois, Northern Iowa, Southwest Missouri State, and Western Illinois, along with non-football sponsoring Cleveland State University, University of Illinois Chicago, Valparaiso University and University of Wisconsin–Green Bay. The conference continued to sponsor football at the Division I-AA level, now under the new AMCU name, from 1982 until 1984, when the football sponsoring members of the Missouri Valley Conference joined with the football sponsoring members of the AMCU to form the beginnings of what is now the Missouri Valley Football Conference; current members University of North Dakota, North Dakota State University, University of South Dakota, and South Dakota State University continue to house their FCS football programs there to this day.
=== Changes and the addition of women&#x27;s sports ===
The conference saw its first changes in the early 1990s. Southwest Missouri State departed for membership in the Missouri Valley Conference as the University of Akron and Northern Illinois University joined in 1990. Then Wright State University joined in 1991 as Northern Iowa followed Southwest Missouri State to the MVC.

Major changes came to the conference in 1992. First, Akron left for the Mid-American Conference (MAC) and another Ohio school, Youngstown State University, replaced it. More significantly, the Mid-Continent added women&#x27;s sports by absorbing the North Star Conference (NSC), a women&#x27;s-only league whose final seven members were in the Mid-Continent. All of the final NSC members except for Akron moved their women&#x27;s sports into the Mid-Continent. At the same time, Eastern Illinois and Western Illinois moved their women&#x27;s sports into the Mid-Continent when their former women&#x27;s sports home, the Gateway Conference, merged into the Missouri Valley Conference. The University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee joined the Mid-Continent a year later.

=== Horizon and ECC transitions ===
In 1994, charter members Cleveland State, UIC and UWGB, as well as newer members Northern Illinois, Wisconsin–Milwaukee, and Wright State left the conference to join the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, now known as the Horizon League.

The Mid-Continent absorbed Central Connecticut State University, Chicago State University, Northeastern Illinois University, the University at Buffalo, and Troy State University (now Troy University) from the collapsed East Coast Conference in response. None of these institutions remain in the league.

The University of Missouri–Kansas City, formerly an independent, also joined the Mid-Continent Conference in 1994.

=== Declining membership ===
Eastern Illinois moved to the Ohio Valley Conference in 1996, reducing membership to nine programs. Troy State departed for the Trans America Athletic Conference while Central Connecticut State joined the Northeast Conference in 1997. Buffalo joined the Mid-American Conference in 1998 while Northeastern Illinois ceased intercollegiate athletics at that time. Oral Roberts University and Southern Utah University replaced the former pair while Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI; its athletic program is now IU Indy) and Oakland University moved into the latter duo&#x27;s spots a year later.

Youngstown State switched to the Horizon League in 2001, and Centenary College replaced it in 2003. Chicago State University announced in the spring of 2006 that it would withdraw from the conference to compete as an independent starting in the 2006–07 school year. Charter member Valparaiso then moved to the Horizon in 2007.

=== Renewed expansion and contraction ===
Conference expansion was discussed at length at the Mid-Continent Conference annual Presidents Council meeting in 2006, and Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW, now Purdue Fort Wayne), North Dakota State, and South Dakota State were approved for site visits. On August 30, 2006, IPFW accepted an invitation to join the Mid-Continent Conference as a full member starting July 1, 2007. Both North Dakota State and South Dakota State also accepted invitations to join the conference the next day.

The Summit League continued its renewed expansion push with the admission of the University of South Dakota. The Coyotes began conference play in the 2011–12 academic year and become eligible for all championships the following season. Centenary College subsequently announced that it would leave the Summit League following the 2010–2011 campaign.

The University of North Dakota had also been openly rumored to have been courted by the Summit League, but controversy over the Fighting Sioux nickname in all likelihood prevented UND&#x27;s admission at that time. Expectations that UND would join the Summit League came to an end on November 1, 2010, when North Dakota instead accepted an invitation to join the Big Sky Conference. The University of South Dakota entered into very brief negotiations to join the Big Sky as well, rather than continuing their plans to join the Summit. However, South Dakota chose instead to remain with the more compact Summit League (along with other Dakota schools, NDSU and SDSU). As the University of Nebraska Omaha began the transition to Division I athletics in all sports, it joined the Summit League on July 1, 2012. With the departures of Centenary to Division III at the end of the 2010–11 athletic year, and Oral Roberts (Southland Conference) and Southern Utah (Big Sky Conference) for other Division I conferences at the end of the 2011–12 athletic year, the Summit League continued with nine institutions, all within the Midwest geographical region.

The conference unveiled the University of Denver (DU) as its tenth member on November 27, 2012, and the Pioneers joined in July 2013. While Denver is slightly outside The Summit&#x27;s current Midwestern base, the city&#x27;s status as a major air hub seemingly minimized travel issues for the other members. With Denver among the eight of ten Western Athletic Conference (WAC) members switching to other conferences, that league searched for new members. UMKC announced on February 7, 2013, that it would be one of six schools joining the WAC for the 2013–14 season, dropping The Summit League back to nine member schools. Membership fell to eight schools on May 7, 2013, when Oakland announced that it was joining the Horizon League. Eight of the nine then-current Horizon League programs were former Summit League members with Oakland&#x27;s move (the Horizon has since added two more members that were never in The Summit League, Northern Kentucky and Robert Morris, as well as another former Summit member in Purdue Fort Wayne).

In December 2013, The Summit League office announced that Oral Roberts University would return to the conference in all sports, effective July 1, 2014.

The next changes to the conference&#x27;s core membership were announced in 2017. First, on January 26, North Dakota, which had resolved its controversy by selecting the new nickname Fighting Hawks, unveiled as a new member beginning in 2018. Then, on June 28, IUPUI announced it would leave the conference to join the Horizon League effective July 1, 2017.

For much of 2018, speculation involving further league expansion focused on Augustana University, a Division II school located in the Summit&#x27;s headquarters city of Sioux Falls. Many of the school&#x27;s boosters have ties to Sanford Health, a hospital company that has long been a major league sponsor and also owns the office complex that houses the league headquarters. The university announced on December 14 that it would start a transition to Division I, though stating at the time that no such move would take place until at least 2021. However, on May 22, 2020, the Summit League commissioner, Tom Douple, informed Augustana president Stephanie Herseth Sandlin that the conference would not be adding more new teams &quot;at this time.&quot; The conference expanded anyway, announcing in June 2019 that UMKC would return in 2020 after a seven-year absence. However, shortly thereafter, Purdue Fort Wayne announced its 2020 departure for the Horizon League, maintaining the full-time conference membership at nine schools. Then, on October 4, 2019, the University of St. Thomas, a Minnesota school that was set to be expelled from its longtime athletic home of the NCAA Division III Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) in 2021, announced that it received an invitation to join the Summit upon its MIAC departure. St. Thomas eventually received a waiver of an NCAA rule mandating that Division III schools can only transition to Division II, allowing the school to move directly to D-I on the originally announced schedule.

Shortly before St. Thomas&#x27; future conference membership was confirmed, the University of Northern Colorado was announced as a baseball-only member effective in 2021–22. The most recent change to the affiliate membership was announced on May 11, 2022, when Lindenwood University and the University of Southern Indiana were announced as new affiliates in men&#x27;s soccer plus men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving effective in 2022–23. Both institutions began transitions from Division II as new members of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC), which at the time did not sponsor any of these schools&#x27; Summit League sports, in July 2022. Southern Indiana started its swimming &amp; diving program for both sexes in 2022–23. In late March 2023, the OVC announced that it would begin sponsoring men&#x27;s soccer that fall, leading to Eastern Illinois, Lindenwood, and Southern Indiana moving that sport to their full-time home. Eastern Illinois and Southern Indiana remain swimming &amp; diving affiliates, while Lindenwood dropped both of its swimming &amp; diving programs after the 2023–24 season.

In early May 2023, it was announced that founding member Western Illinois would be leaving the Summit League in all sports and would join the Ohio Valley Conference beginning in fall 2023. In mid-June, Western Illinois announced that its men&#x27;s soccer team would remain in the Summit League for the fall 2023 season, and depart for the OVC after that.

On April 4, 2024, both entities announced that Delaware would be joining the conference as an associate member in men&#x27;s soccer starting in 2025.

On May 7, 2024, the league announced that Northern Colorado, who is also an affiliate in baseball, and Weber State would be joining the league for men&#x27;s golf starting in the fall of 2024.

On December 23, 2024, the league announced that UMass would be joining the conference as an affiliate in men&#x27;s soccer starting in the 2025 season.

==Sponsored sports==
The Summit League sponsors championship competition in nine men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports. Former full member Eastern Illinois is an associate member for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving and men&#x27;s soccer. Drake and Illinois State became associate members in men&#x27;s tennis starting in 2017–18, and former full member Valparaiso rejoined for men&#x27;s swimming and men&#x27;s tennis at the same time. Valparaiso dropped men&#x27;s tennis after the 2019–20 season; it remained a swimming associate until moving that sport to the Mid-American Conference in 2021. Northern Colorado became a baseball associate starting in the 2022 season (2021–22 school year), and Lindenwood and Southern Indiana became associates in men&#x27;s soccer plus men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving in the 2022–23 school year. Eastern Illinois, Lindenwood, and Southern Indiana moved men&#x27;s soccer to their primary home of the Ohio Valley Conference in 2023–24 while remaining Summit affiliates in swimming &amp; diving. Western Illinois elected to leave the league full time in 2023, but its men&#x27;s soccer team remained in the Summit through the fall 2023 season.

==Media rights==
On August 10, 2023, the Summit League announced the signing of a new three-year media rights deal that would tie the league with CBS Sports Network and even closer ties with Midco Sports through the 2025–26 academic year. The new deal transfers the Summit League&#x27;s men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s basketball championship game rights over to CBS Sports Network from ESPN, and adds a guaranteed six regular-season men&#x27;s basketball games on the network with an option of six more men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s basketball games during the season. For the 2024 tournament, CBS Sports Network will also broadcast the women&#x27;s basketball tournament semifinal. In 2025 and 2026 there will remain an option to have the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments semifinals on CBS Sports Network if scheduling allows.

The Midco contract will now expand to the creation of a new all-league media platform called The Summit League Network. It will provide access to all nine member institutions&#x27; live streams of every home game, both non-conference and in-conference, as well as interviews and other league info. This expansion will preserve the local media rights given out at select institutions, as the provider for the university will supply Midco with that broadcast/live stream to be simulcast on the Summit League Network.

<text>Ice Cold in Alex is a 1958 British war film set during the Western Desert campaign of World War II based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Landon. Directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring John Mills, the film was a prizewinner at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival. Under the title Desert Attack, a shortened, 79-minute version of the film was released in the United States in 1961. Film critic Craig Butler later referred to the shortened versions as nonsensical.

==Plot==
Captain Anson, the officer commanding a British RASC Motor Ambulance Company in Tobruk, is suffering from battle fatigue and alcoholism. Ahead of the Siege of Tobruk by the German Afrika Korps, Anson and most of his unit are ordered to evacuate to Alexandria. During the evacuation Anson, MSM Tom Pugh and two nurses, Sister Diana Murdoch and Sister Denise Norton, become separated from the others in an Austin K2/Y ambulance nicknamed Katy. The quartet decide to drive across the desert back to British lines.

As they depart they come across an Afrikaner South African officer, Captain van der Poel, who carries a large pack, to which he seems very attached. After the South African shows Anson two bottles of gin in his backpack, van der Poel persuades Anson to let him join their drive to the safety of the British lines in Alexandria.
En route the group encounters various obstacles, including a minefield, a broken suspension spring - during its replacement van der Poel&#x27;s great strength saves the group when he supports Katy on his back when the jack collapses - and the dangerous terrain of the Qattara Depression.

Twice the group encounters motorised elements of the advancing Afrika Korps; in one encounter they are fired on and Norton is fatally wounded. Anson blames himself and his drinking for Norton&#x27;s death, and vows not to drink any alcohol until he can have an &quot;ice-cold lager in &#x27;Alex&#x27;&quot;. Van der Poel, who claims to have learned German while working in German South West Africa, is able to talk the Germans into allowing them to go on their way. The second time, however, the Germans seem reluctant until van der Poel shows them the contents of his backpack.

This pack becomes the focus of suspicion. Pugh, already troubled by van der Poel&#x27;s lack of knowledge of the South African Army&#x27;s tea-brewing technique, follows him when he heads off into the desert with his pack and a spade (supposedly to dig a latrine). Pugh thinks he sees an antenna. Later, at night, they decide to use the ambulance headlights to see what van der Poel is really up to. He panics, blunders into some dry quicksand and submerges his pack, though not before Anson and Murdoch see that it contains a radio set. They drag him to safety. While he recovers, they realise he is probably a German spy but decide not to confront him. During the final leg of the journey Katy must be hand-cranked in reverse up a sand dune escarpment and van der Poel&#x27;s strength is again crucial to success.

Continuing their drive, the party discuss their conviction that van der Poel is a spy and decide that they do not want to see him shot. When they reach Alexandria, Anson delivers everyone&#x27;s papers except van der Poel&#x27;s to the Military Police check point and (off-screen) reports to the MP&#x27;s senior officer that &quot;van der Poel&quot; is a German soldier whom they met lost in the desert and has surrendered to them under his parole (word of honour). Anson secures the MP&#x27;s agreement to allow the party to enjoy a beer with their ‘captive’ before taking him into custody as a prisoner of war.

The party then make their way to a bar and Anson orders a cold beer, which he consumes with relish. But before they have drunk their first round a Corps of Military Police officer arrives to arrest van der Poel. Anson orders him to wait until the time previously agreed. Having become friends with van der Poel and indebted to him for saving the group&#x27;s lives, Anson tells him that if he gives his real name he will be treated as a prisoner of war rather than as a spy (which would mean execution by firing squad).

Van der Poel admits to being &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Otto Lutz, an engineering officer with the 21st Panzer Division. Pugh, noticing that Lutz is still wearing fake South African dog tags, rips them off before the police see them. After saying his farewells and concluding that they were &quot;all against the desert, the greater enemy&quot;, Lutz is driven away, with a new respect for the British.

==Production==
The film was based on the 1957 novel &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; and its serialisation (as &quot;Escape in the Desert&quot;) in the magazine &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the book as &quot;an excellent escape story played out in the best Hitchcock manner.&quot;

The screenplay contains multiple key changes from the novel, including making Anson rather than Pugh the protagonist. ABPC bought the rights and assigned T. J. Morison to collaborate on a treatment with Landon under the supervision of Walter Mycroft.

Richard Todd says he turned down a lead role because he felt the story was far fetched and he was getting tired of military roles.

The producers had intended to shoot the location work for &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; in Egypt, but they had to switch to Libya because of the Suez conflict.

Filming began 10 September 1957.

Sylvia Syms (Sister Murdoch) said in a 2011 interview about the film that conditions during the desert shoot were so difficult it felt like they were actually in the situation the film portrays. She said: &quot;You may find this hard to believe, but there was very little acting. It was horrible. We &quot;became&quot; those people ... we &quot;were&quot; those people&quot;. She said that today people would probably call it method acting, but added: &#x27;We didn&#x27;t know what Method Acting was, we just called it &#x27;getting on with it&#x27;.&quot; Syms said that during the scene where the ambulance rolls backwards down the hill narrowly avoiding her, the actors assumed there would be a hawser to stop the vehicle if anything went wrong, but there was not. The actress said she was &quot;pretty sure&quot; Mills, Quayle and Andrews angrily upbraided director J. Lee Thompson for this risky approach. She added: &quot;He liked to push actors a bit&quot;. The quicksand sequence was filmed in an ice cold artificial bog in an English studio (some scenes were shot at Elstree) and was &quot;very tough&quot; on Quayle and Mills. Syms said the producers got a good deal out of her for &quot;£30 a week&quot;, adding: &quot;But I made a lot more when they turned it into an advert for Carlsberg&quot;. She said there are &quot;no false heroics in it&quot; and that she had been told by desert war veterans it is a good picture of soldiers in that theatre of war, adding: &quot;I am proud of it&quot;.

There were a number of British films being shot in Africa around this time, including &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, &quot;Nor the Moon by Night&quot; and &quot;The Black Tent&quot;.

== Music ==
Although some sources claim that music was kept to a minimum, there is in fact a great deal of dramatic underscoring. Leighton Lucas wrote a stirring military march called &quot;The Road to Alex&quot;, which was the main theme, and a &quot;Romance&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was one of the twelve most popular at the British box office in 1958 (that list included several other war related movies – &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;The Camp on Blood Island&quot;, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, &quot;The Key&quot;, &quot;Carve Her Name with Pride&quot;, &quot;The Wind Cannot Read&quot; – as well as &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot;, &quot;A Cry from the Streets&quot;, &quot;Happy Is the Bride&quot; and &quot;Indiscreet&quot;.) &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; listed it as being &quot;in the money&quot; at the British box office in 1958.

===Awards===
The film was nominated for several awards:
* Winner FIPRESCI Award at the Berlin International Film Festival
* Nominated BAFTA Award for Best Film
* Nominated BAFTA Award for Best British Film
* Nominated BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Anthony Quayle)
* Nominated BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay (T. J. Morrison)
* Nominated Golden Bear Berlin International Film Festival

===Legacy===
The film is arguably the best known credit for Sylvia Syms.

==Home media==
A Region B/2 Blu-ray restoration of &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 18 February 2018. A restored region B/2 version was previously released on 11 September 2011. In March 2020, the film was released on Blu-ray in region A/1 (North America) by Film Movement Classics in a five-film set called &quot;Their Finest Hour 5 British War Classics&quot;.

==Lager advertisement==
The final scene, in which Mills&#x27;s character finally gets his glass of lager, was used in the 1980s in beer advertisements on television. The scene was reportedly filmed some weeks after the rest of the film, at Elstree. Real lager had to be used to &quot;look right&quot;, and Mills had to drink numerous glasses full until the shots were finished, and was &quot;a little &#x27;heady&#x27;&quot; by the end.

Sylvia Syms has said that the Danish beer Carlsberg was chosen because they could never have been seen to be drinking a German lager, since the United Kingdom and Germany are at war during the film. The beer referred to in the original novel is Rheingold, which, despite its German name, is American.

Scenes from the film were used in a late-1980s&#x27; television advertising campaign for the German Holsten Pils lager. Each advertisement mixed original footage from a different film (another example was &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, 1963) with new humorous material starring British comedian Griff Rhys Jones and finishing with the slogan: &quot;A Holsten Pils Production&quot;. In retaliation, rival Carlsberg simply lifted the segment in which Mills contemplates the freshly poured lager in the clearly Carlsberg-branded glass, before downing it in one go and declaring, &quot;Worth waiting for!&quot; This was followed by a variation in the usual Carlsberg tagline: &quot;Still probably the best lager in the world.&quot;

<text>Richard William &quot;Rube&quot; Marquard (October 9, 1886 – June 1, 1980) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball in the 1910s and early 1920s. He achieved his greatest success with the New York Giants. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.

==Early life==
Rube Marquard was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to German immigrant Fred Marquard and Lena Heiser Marquard. Marquard claimed an 1889 year of birth, but 1900 census data and a birth certificate show an 1886 year of birth. Lena Marquard died of an abdominal infection in 1899, and Rube&#x27;s grandmother took responsibility for raising him. Marquard quit school after the fifth grade; biographer Larry Mansch writes that he &quot;simply refused to attend any longer&quot;.

Newspaper reports first mentioned Marquard in 1905, when he played with an amateur team in Cleveland. Though pitching for a poor team that had a 1–15 win–loss record at one point, Marquard attracted attention as a top pitcher. He broke a City League record with 16 strikeouts in a game against a team known as Brittons Printing. In September, the City League season finished and he signed with the semiprofessional Telling Strollers, an independent team sponsored by an ice cream company.

==Career==
He started his minor-league baseball career in 1906. Despite his nickname, he was a city kid. As he told it in the 1966 book &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, a writer in his minor-league days compared him favorably with Rube Waddell, and soon Marquard was being called &quot;Rube&quot;, also.

In 1907, he went 23–13 with a 2.01 earned run average (ERA) and led the Central League in wins. In 1908, he went 28–19 with a 1.69 ERA and led the American Association in wins. The New York Giants purchased Marquard for $11,000 — a then unheard-of sum to pay for a baseball player&#x27;s contract — and his lack of success early in his major-league career led to his being tagged &quot;the $11,000 lemon&quot;.
From 1911 to 1913, Marquard won at least 23 games each season, and helped the Giants win three consecutive National League pennants. In 1911, he led the league with 237 strikeouts. In 1912, he led the league with 26 wins. He also made baseball history by winning 19 decisions in a row. Marquard allegedly celebrated by buying an opal stickpin to reward himself. Upon being told by a friend that opals were a jinx, he threw the pin into a river, but apparently, the curse had already done its work, as he lost his next decision.

In 1914, Marquard went 12–22, and in 1915, he joined the Brooklyn Robins. He helped the team win pennants in 1916 and 1920. He then played for the Cincinnati Reds in 1921 and Boston Braves from 1922 to 1925.

During the 1920 World Series, he was arrested for ticket scalping in Cleveland. He was alleged to be selling eight world box seats for $350 ($ in current dollar terms), while the original cost was $52.80 ($ in current dollar terms). He was found guilty and fined $1 plus $3.50 in court costs. 

Marquard finished his major-league career in 1925 with a record of 201–177 and a 3.08 ERA. His 1,593 strikeouts ranked third in major-league history among left-handers at the time (behind Rube Waddell and Eddie Plank), and stood as the National League record for southpaws until his total was surpassed by Carl Hubbell, another New York Giant, in 1942.

He later pitched and managed in the minor leagues until 1933. After baseball, he worked as a betting window teller at Narragansett Park.

==Legacy==
Marquard was a performer in vaudeville, appearing with Blossom Seeley and later marrying her. That same year, Seeley gave birth to a son, Richard William Marquard II.

He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. His selection has often been criticized by the sabermetrics community, since Marquard&#x27;s career adjusted ERA+ was only slightly better than league average. Bill James described Marquard as &quot;probably the worst starting pitcher in the Hall of Fame.&quot; Marquard had been interviewed for the popular 1966 baseball book, &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, and his chapter is thought to be one of the primary reasons for his election. However, most of the stories that he &quot;recounted&quot; were later found to be false.

Marquard died in Baltimore, Maryland, on June 1, 1980, at the age of 93. He is interred in Baltimore Hebrew Cemetery in Baltimore.

<text>The Siberian is a centuries-old landrace (natural variety) of domestic cat in Russia, and recently developed as a formal breed with standards promulgated the world over since the late-1980s. Since 2006, the breed is recognised for registry and championship status with all major cat registries. 

The formal name of the breed is Siberian Forest Cat, but it is typically referred to as the Siberian or Siberian cat. Formerly, sometimes the names Moscow Semi-Longhair and Russian Longhair were also used. The colourpoint variant or sister breed, called the Neva Masquerade, is categorised as a separate cat breed by some registries, including FIFe, WCF, and ACF.

The breed developed from an ancient, natural landrace from Siberia and is the national cat of Russia. While it began as a landrace, Siberians are selectively bred and pedigreed in all major cat fancier and breeder organisations. This means that all Siberian cats are purebred cats with a formally registered ancestry. It is a medium- to large-sized, muscular breed with a bushy tail.

The Siberian is often called hypoallergenic because it produces less Fel d 1 than other cat breeds. A research study of Siberian cats native to the area of Russia from which the breed stock originated confirmed the subjects produced less (the strongest among the eight known allergens produced in cat saliva, therefore, is deposited on their fur when they groom themselves) than non-Siberian cats.

==History==

Siberian cats are Russia&#x27;s native forest cats and are known to have existed for a long time in the dense forests of Siberia. The earliest known reference is from 1000 AD. It was long speculated by cat experts that the ancient breed was the distant ancestor of all modern-day long-haired breeds. However, phylogenetic studies showed that for example Maine Coon cats are descendants of British cats brought to New England by Puritan settlers. It is not relatedness what makes them look similar to the Siberian, but convergent evolution. These breeds all formed in harsh climates in which natural selection pressures for similar qualities. However, Siberians are genetically closely related to Norwegian Forest cats and the random-bred Northern European cat populations.

=== First introduction to the world ===
Outside of Russia, the Siberian cat was first mentioned in the 1864 edition of the German book &quot;Brehms Tierleben&quot;, where Brehm describes a long-haired cat breed as &quot;a red Tobolsk cat from Siberia&quot; (&quot;eine rote Tobolsker Katze aus Sibirien&quot;).

Later in 1889 and 1892, the Siberian cat was again mentioned in the two editions of a book by Harrison Weir, who organised and wrote about some of the earliest cat shows in England in 1871. The Siberian cat is described in the book under its former name, the &quot;Russian Long-haired Cat&quot;. However, in the preface of the 1892 edition, Weir also mentions a cat he refers to as a &quot;Siberian Cat&quot;:

During this first introduction of the Siberian to the West, the cat was often still known as the &quot;Russian Longhair&quot;. These cats were crossed with other popular long-haired breeds, and the separate identity was soon lost.

=== Second introduction to the world ===
Due to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a second wave of Siberian cats were introduced to the rest of the world and an officially acknowledged cat breed was developed. In 1987, a young male and female were taken from St. Petersburg to Berlin by a cat enthusiast, who started a serious breeding program with registration under the name &quot;Siberian Forest Cat&quot; or &quot;Siberian Cat&quot;. Since that success, there has been an increase in interest in the Siberian breed within Russia itself. 

In the Russian cat fancy, each cat club devises its own cat standards. This fact led to much confusion in other countries when the first Siberians were arriving and many appeared quite different from each other, depending on what area of Russia they originated from. One of the earliest written Siberian breed standards was published by the Kotofei Cat Club in St. Petersburg in 1987 under the name Siberian cat (Russian: , or ).

Officially registered Siberians first arrived in the United States in 1990, and in the United Kingdom in 2002. During the early 1990s, it was expensive and difficult to locate and import Siberians from Eastern Europe. Therefore, inbreeding in registered purebred Siberians became common in certain regions after the breed&#x27;s introduction. Because the breed is relatively new to registration and breed books are open, breeders are able to add foundation stock from Russia to the breed. This reduces the level of relatedness within the breed, and increases vigor in the breed. Although gaining in popularity since the 2020s, the expense of importing the cats from Eastern Europe, and the common breeder&#x27;s practice of early neutering pedigree kittens, keeps the breed still relatively rare outside of Eastern Europe.

== Breed-registration ==
=== Registry ===
Nowadays, all Siberian and Neva Masquerade cats are selectively bred and pedigreed in all major cat registries under the category &quot;Siberian (Forest) Cat&quot;, or in several registries under &quot;Neva Masquerade&quot; for the colourpoint sister breed. Similar to other officially recognised cat breeds, the term &quot;Siberian&quot; is only meant to be used for cats from this specific breed, which are by definition all purebred cats with a known and formally registered ancestry, also known as the cat&#x27;s pedigree &quot;paperwork&quot;. The purpose of the registry of Siberian cats is to develop and maintain a healthy cat breed by controlling inbreeding and the spread of hereditary diseases, and regulating the well-being of the cats. Unregistered cats with a similar appearance as the Siberian cat are referred to as domestic long-haired cats.

Each of the (inter)national cat registries applies breed standards, which cover a description of the ideal characteristics specific to the Siberian breed. In general, Siberian kittens will grow up to be a representative of this ideal breed standard in both looks and character. These standards represent the phenotype of the Siberian breed and may include criteria of physical and morphological appearance, genetics, and of athletic or productive performance. In cat shows, Siberian cats will be compared with and judged after these breed standards based on a point system. Faults or disqualifications are given to show cats with medical disorders, uncharacteristic traits, or cats that lack in well-being and proper care from their owners.

===Recognition===
After its introduction worldwide in the late-1980s, it took nearly two decades for the breed to be accepted for registry and championship status with all major international cat registries in 2006. In 1991, the WCF was the first international registry to admit a breed standard of the Siberian, based on the Russian standard. TICA accepted the breed into their &quot;New Breed program&quot; in 1992, and in 1996 granted them championship status. In 1997, the breed was recognised by FIFe, and since 2011 the Neva Masquerade officially split off as a separate breed. The Siberian was accepted for registration (under &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;) by CFA in 2000, and advanced to championship status in 2006. The GCCF has recognised the breed for registry since 2004.

===Popularity===
Even though the Siberian was introduced outside Russia in the late-1980s, it wasn&#x27;t until the mid-2010s that the Siberian breed started to gain in popularity. Especially at the beginning of the 2020s, the popularity of the Siberian rapidly increased worldwide.

Since 2004, the breed was recognised for registry with the GCCF (predominantly in the United Kingdom). By 2022, the Siberian cat was the 9th most registered cat breed in the GCCF, while in 2012 it was still in 20th place, and in 2017 in 15th place.

Similar to the popularity seen in the GCCF registry numbers, the Siberian is also growing in popularity in the CFA. In 2017, the Siberian was also the 15th most registered cat breed in the CFA, while in 2012 it was still in the 18th place. Since the 2020s, the Siberian gained worldwide in popularity. It jumped from the 15th place in 2020, to the 11th place in 2021, and made it in 2022 for the first time to the top 10 at the number 10 spot.

In 2022, there were 152 Siberian breeders out of the 42.864 breeders registered in TICA, predominantly in the United States and Canada. In 2023, there were 55 Siberian breeders out of the 76.682 breeders registered with FIFe, predominantly in Europe.

In September 2023, there were a total of 40.700 (incl. deceased) Siberian and Neva Masquerade cats registered with PawPeds, the biggest cat pedigree database worldwide and used by breeders to increase genetic variation and prevent the spread of heredity diseases in pedigree cats. Out of the total 40.700 cats, 33.500 were born after 2000. Half of these cats (17.000) were born between January 2015 and September 2023, again showing the rapid increase in popularity after the mid-2010s of the Siberian breed.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===

==== Body ====
Known to be an exceptionally agile jumper, the Siberian is a strong and powerfully-built cat, with strong hindquarters and large, well-rounded paws. Although heavy boned, the legs are relatively short. Their bushy tail is medium in length and slightly shorter than the torso length. Their body lengths varies in size from medium to large. Siberians have firm, barrel-shaped torsos, and stockier builds than other cats. The general impression of the body is one of circles and roundness. The posture can be compared with the characteristic wide and sturdy stance of a bulldog.

Siberians have a slight arch to their back, because their hind legs are slightly longer than the front legs. This shape and the power in their hind legs contribute to their incredible agility and enable them to jump exceptionally high.

Siberians develop rather slowly, reaching their fully matured body at about five years of age. Female Siberians are considerably smaller than males. Full-grown adults weigh on average between 4.5-9kg.

==== Face ====
The characteristic round shapes are also clearly visible in the facial features of the Siberian. Their round face consists of a broad forehead at the top of their skull and narrows slightly to a full-rounded, short muzzle. The eyes are large and round, and give an overall sweet expression to their face. The outer corners are slightly angled towards the base of their ears. Their medium-sized ears are broad at the base and rounded at the tip. They are slightly tilted forwards and should be set as much on the sides of the head as on top, preferably one to one and one half ear width apart. Lynx ear tipping is allowed.

==== Coat ====

Siberians express the three natural types of feline fur: guard hair, awn hair, and down hair. These three layers form a semi-long to long, well-developed, very dense triple-coat, of which the guard hairs are water-repellent. This unique dense triple-coat protects the cat from the Russian weather extremes. The thick fur is textured but glossy, and needs frequent grooming to prevent matting. The summer coat is distinctly shorter than the winter coat. Because the Siberians are a slow-maturing breed, it can take several years for the coat of young Siberians to fully develop.

Siberian cats moult twice a year. They will shed their heavy winter coat during spring. This winter moult is instigated not by a change in temperature but by a change in day length. Many Siberians will experience a less intense &quot;mini-moult&quot; at the end of the summer season to prepare for their thick winter coat, unlike other cats, which will experience a &quot;heavy moult&quot; more than twice a year. However, they will still lose fur year-round and require grooming multiple times a week in order to prevent their dense triple-coat from matting.


===== Colouration =====
All Western coat colours and patterns are genetically possible in the breed, such as tabby, solid, tortoiseshell, and bicolour. However, the most common colour in the Siberian cat breed is black (brown) mackerel tabby. The Western coat colours are white, black, blue, red, and cream. All major registries do not permit the Eastern colour varieties of chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, and fawn in the Siberian breed. The allowance for the dilution modified &quot;caramel&quot; and &quot;apricot&quot; depends on the registry.

All colourations are allowed with any amount of white spotting. Furthermore, all colourations can be combined with the golden and silver (incl. smoke) factors, which are allowed in tabby, &quot;tipped&quot; and &quot;shaded&quot; banding. In Siberians the golden colouration is caused by the CORIN-gene. This golden colour is called &quot;sunshine&quot;, and the silver-golden variety is called &quot;bimetallic&quot; or &quot;silver sunshine&quot;. The gene is located on the wide band locus, and the responsible allele is only found in the Siberian breed. The two other identified alleles on this wide band locus are responsible for the golden coats in golden tigers and British Shorthairs.

The Eastern colourpoint pattern is found in the Neva Masquerade, and is non-permitted in registries where the breed is separately registered. In the combined registries, the Neva Masquerade cats are judged separately in the colourpoint-category.

====== Solid-white ======

Completely white (solid-white) Siberian cats are not considered Neva Masquerades, as they do not have the Siamese colourpoint markings. The solid-white colouring is considered Western, and is one of the many colours of traditional Siberian cats. Solid-white traditional Siberian cats can also have blue eyes, however, this is due to a lack of melanin pigment and not a result of the colourpoint gene as is the case with the Neva Masquerade. Solid-white blue-eyed cats have a higher prevalence of genetic deafness. It is advisable and in most cat registries (and certain countries) mandatory to test (BEAR- or OAE-testing) white cats for this trait before breeding with them.

==== Eye colour ====
Siberians come in all eye colours, but clear colours are desirable. However, several registries only allow blue and odd eyes in the solid-white and bicolour varieties, leaving only colours in the golden-copper to green spectrum for the other coats. The solid-white Siberian has four permitted eye colours; blue, green, golden-copper, and odd-eyed.

=== Behaviour ===
The energetic Siberians are known for their playful and adventurous personality, while at the same time being very friendly and easy-going. The breed is known for its dog-like behaviour, due to its affectionate and highly loyal personality. This intelligent breed learns easily and is even known for its ability to learn the &quot;dog game&quot; fetch. They are very social and prefer to be involved in all activities of a household. Siberians are often fascinated by water, and do not mind getting a little wet, as their guard hairs are water-repellent.

The Siberian is a vocal cat, although not in loudness but in frequency. It is known to produce a wide range of different sounds including its melodious chirping voice and a deep, resonant purr.

== Neva Masquerade ==
The Neva Masquerade is the sister breed or colourpoint variety of the Siberian cat. It bears the Siamese colourpoint gene, which results in darker markings on the extremities of their body and bright blue eyes. The gene pool of the Siberian and the Neva Masquerade share a big overlap, as the two have been crossbred for many years. Nowadays, there exists a test for point mutations, which allows breeders to specifically target carriers of the popular point gene.

The Siberian breed was generally recognised in the late-1990s and 2000s by the cat fancy, however, some registries chose to not accept colourpoint varieties in the Siberian breed and register these colourpoint cats under the Neva Masquerade breed.

=== Recent studies ===

Although the Neva Masquerade shares many characteristics with the Siberian in terms of character and appearance, recent studies have shown distinctions between the two in terms of body language, vocalisations, and feline hereditary diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The prevalence of PKD in the Neva Masquerade gene pool is of concern as crossbreeding the two sister breeds could potentially spread PKD into the Siberian breed.

== Health ==
The Siberian is an ancient naturally developed landrace, which makes it a relatively healthy cat breed. In fact, the Siberian breed has the highest heterozygosity degree (genetic variation) among all cat breeds, comparable to random-bred cats.

In a study with almost 550.000 cats of 18 breeds, the disease risks of the different cat breeds were evaluated based on 24 diagnostic categories. It may not come as a surprise that injury is the main cause of morbidity in the athletic, energetic and adventurous Siberian breed. The Siberian even has the highest score in injury risk of all purebreds. While it scores lowest, together with the Ragdoll, in the overall morbidity risk, making the Siberian a relatively healthy cat breed. Siberians had a significantly lower risk in 11 of the 24 diagnostic categories compared to other breeds, including endocrine, ear, neurological and neoplasia. Apart from injury, the Siberian had a higher incidence rate of locomotor and female reproduction-related conditions compared to other cat breeds.

== Fur allergen levels ==
While there is no hypoallergenic cat or dog breed, the decreased dander qualities of the Siberian coat have been noted and commented on for almost ten years. While there is no scientific evidence, breeders and pet owners claim that Siberians can be safe for many allergy sufferers. Since females of all feline breeds produce lower levels of Fel d 1, breeders often suggest that allergic families adopt female cats. Allergy sufferers are advised to check their reactivity directly with the parent cats from whom they plan to adopt a kitten. Many people believe that the breed produces less , the primary allergen present in cats. 

In 1999, Indoor Biotechnologies tested the fur of four cats for ; a mixed breed, two Siberians, and an Abyssinian. The results showed the Siberian and Abyssinian cat fur as having lower levels than the mixed breed cat. Indoor Biotechnologies cautions that the Siberian levels were still high, and that the mixed breed sample was &quot;exceptionally high&quot;. Indoor Biotechnologies warns against using these results to make decisions about pet ownership.

This test of fur allergen levels is cited by many Siberian breeder websites as evidence the breed is hypoallergenic. Critiques include that the sample size (only 4 cats) is below statistical significance, was submitted by a Siberian breeder, and as mentioned, one cat was found to have allergen levels of 62.813 μg (roughly 60× higher than any published professional study).

A not-for-profit association of breeders (&quot;Siberian Research Inc&quot;) was founded in 2005 to study allergen levels and genetic diseases in the Siberian breed. As of March 2010, fur and saliva samples from over 300 Siberians have been submitted for analysis, many directly from a veterinarian. Salivary allergen levels in Siberians ranged from 0.08 to 27 μg per mL of saliva, while fur levels ranged from 5 to 1300 μg. The high end of these ranges is consistent with results from prior studies, though the low end is below expected results.

All Siberians tested were found to produce some , with the highest levels being found in Siberians that have silver-coloured fur. About half of Siberians were found to have levels lower than other breeds, while under twenty percent would be considered very low. Within the low group, males and females had comparable allergen levels.

<text>TechSoup, founded in 1987 as CompuMentor and later known as TechSoup Global, is a nonprofit international network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that provides technical support and technological tools to other nonprofits.

== History ==

After discussing the technology needs of nonprofits with members of the WELL, Daniel Ben-Horin founded CompuMentor (later TechSoup). His objective was to create a program in which those with technology skills (&quot;mentors&quot;) volunteered to assist nonprofit organizations with information technologies. In 1991, Fred Silverman, Apple Computer&#x27;s manager of community affairs, praised CompuMentor as &quot;a perfect marriage of technology and volunteerism.&quot;
CompuMentor also began soliciting donations of technological products, largely from tech magazines that had large stocks of unneeded software sent to them by companies seeking coverage of their products, which CompuMentor collected and then sold to nonprofits for a nominal fee, originally $5.

In 1997, CompuMentor received $350,000 in donations, tying it with the IT Resource Center as the largest Nonprofit Technology Assistance Provider in the U.S.

On May 9, 2000, TechSoup website www.techsoup.org was launched.

In 2008, the organization changed its name to TechSoup Global.
As of 2016, TechSoup reported $30.8 million in revenue. It provides technology assistance services and NGO validation services to nongovernmental organizations, foundations, libraries, and other civil society organizations worldwide in partnerships with companies like Microsoft, Adobe, Cisco and Symantec. In partnership with Microsoft, it formed the TechSoup Global Network to support increased distribution of services to nonprofits.

The TechSoup Global Network includes Fundacja TechSoup, a separately incorporated &quot;regional hub&quot; established by TechSoup Global. It is based in Warsaw, Poland, and supports activities in 48 European countries.

== Notable programs ==

=== TechSoup.org ===
Launched in January 2002, TechSoup.org is a web site serving nonprofits that provides training webinars, community forums and other resources about the use of technology in nonprofit organizations and public libraries. TechSoup partners with Microsoft to distribute Microsoft&#x27;s product donations globally, and helps to connect nonprofits and libraries to corporate donors such as Adobe, Symantec, Cisco and Intuit. TechSoup.org also verifies the nonprofit status of organizations seeking donations and matches them to the donated technology products they need.

=== GuideStar International ===

GuideStar International is a global service that provides open access to accurate NGO data. GSI was begun in 2010 when TechSoup Global and GuideStar International, a U.K.-registered charity that promotes transparency and civil society organization reporting, combined operations.

=== NGOsource ===

NGOsource, a project of the Council on Foundations and TechSoup Global, is an online service for U.S. grantmakers to receive equivalency determinations, which are legal certifications that a non-U.S. NGO is equivalent to a U.S. public charity, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of international grantmaking. Launched in March 2013, it helps U.S. grantmakers streamline their global philanthropy. According to its website, NGOsource was active in 126 countries as of 2018.

=== NetSquared ===

NetSquared organized local actors to collaborate in open innovation challenges, as well as monthly face-to-face meetups. NetSquared was organized into local chapters that had monthly meetings. Chapters went by such names as Tech4Good or NetSquared Chicago. NetSquared&#x27;s &quot;ReStart Slovakia&quot; challenge provided recognition and seed funds to help launch the &quot;Open Courts&quot; project to promote transparency in Slovakia&#x27;s judicial system. TechSoup Connect became the successor to NetSquared in 2021, and each chapter continues to be led by a volunteer who produces local events, in-person and online.

=== Quad ===

In February 2022, TechSoup launched a subscription service, Quad, which it described as &quot;TechSoup&#x27;s peer-to-peer community where nonprofit organizations connect with tech experts and each other to do great things.&quot;

<text>Albert Fred &quot;Red&quot; Schoendienst ( ; February 2, 1923 – June 6, 2018) was an American professional baseball second baseman, coach, and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB), and is largely known for his coaching, managing, and playing years with the St. Louis Cardinals. He played for 19 years with the Cardinals (1945–1956, 1961–1963), New York Giants (1956–1957) and Milwaukee Braves (1957–1960), and was named to 10 All Star teams. He then managed the Cardinals from 1965 through 1976 – the second-longest managerial tenure in the team&#x27;s history (behind Tony La Russa). Under his direction, St. Louis won the 1967 and 1968 National League pennants and the 1967 World Series, and he was named National League Manager of the Year in 1967 and 1968. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989. At the time of his death, he had worn a Major League uniform for 74 consecutive years as a player, coach, or manager, and had served 67 of his 76 years in baseball with the Cardinals.

==Early life==
Schoendienst was born in Germantown, Illinois, approximately east of downtown St. Louis to Joe and Mary Schoendienst, one of seven children. His father was a coal miner, and the family lived without running water or electricity.

Schoendienst showed a marked aptitude for baseball at a young age. In school he would handicap himself by hitting left-handed. In 1939, at age 16, he dropped out of school to join the Civilian Conservation Corps, a major public works employment program within President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. While working on a fence, he suffered a serious injury to his left eye from a nail. Many doctors recommended removal of the eye, but eventually Red found one willing to pursue non-surgical treatment. He endured constant headaches and years of rehabilitation.

After the eye injury, Schoendienst found it very difficult to read breaking balls while batting right-handed against right-handed pitchers. To solve the problem, he used the left-handed batting skills he acquired as a youth to become a switch hitter. In the spring of 1942, he participated in a St. Louis Cardinals open tryout with about 400 other hopefuls. Though he was not signed at the tryout, Joe Mathes, the Cardinals&#x27; chief scout, later changed his mind and drove to Germantown to sign him for $75 a month ($ in current dollar terms).

==Minor leagues and military service (1942–1944)==
Schoendienst began his professional career in the D-level Georgia–Florida League with the Albany Cardinals, followed by the Union City Greyhounds of the Class D Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League. At Union City, he collected eight hits in his first eight at bats (AB) on his way to batting .407 in six games. In 1943, after playing nine games for the Lynchburg Cardinals in the Class B Piedmont League, he had attained 17 hits in 36 AB. This strong start earned him a promotion to the double-A International League&#x27;s (IL) Rochester Red Wings, where he batted .337 in 136 games with 21 doubles, six home runs (HR) and 20 stolen bases (SB). His .337 average was the league&#x27;s best; he won the IL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award and gained visibility as a top prospect.

In 1944, still in Rochester, Schoendienst hit .373 in 25 games. He was drafted mid-season into the U.S. Army, but received a medical discharge on January 1, 1945, due to his eye injury and sustained trauma incurred while shooting bazookas.

==Major league playing career (1945–1963)==
The Cardinals invited Schoendienst for spring training in Cairo, Illinois, in 1945. Schoendiest had been a shortstop in the minor leagues. but as the Cardinals had Marty Marion, who had won the National League&#x27;s (NL) MVP Award in 1944, as their shortstop, St. Louis assigned Schoendienst to be their left fielder. Totaling 137 games in his rookie season, he batted .278 with a league-high 26 SB. In 1946, the Cardinals moved Schoendienst to play second base on their way to their third World Series title in five years. During the 1946 offseason, he won the televised home run derby. With sure hands and quick reflexes, he led the National League&#x27;s second basemen for seven seasons and handled 320 consecutive chances without an error in 1950. In that season&#x27;s All-Star Game, he won the contest for the National League with a home run in the top of the 14th inning. It was the first All-Star game to go to extra innings. His 1956 league record fielding percentage of .9934 stood for 30 years until broken by Ryne Sandberg.

In a trade that was extremely unpopular with Cardinals fans and his best friend Stan Musial, Schoendienst, along with Jackie Brandt, Bill Sarni, Dick Littlefield and Bobby Stephenson, was sent to the New York Giants for Alvin Dark, Whitey Lockman, Ray Katt and Don Liddle on June 14, 1956. The transaction was made possible after the Cardinals switched Don Blasingame from shortstop to second base to replace Schoendienst.

The following season, the Giants traded Schoendienst to the Milwaukee Braves for Bobby Thomson, Ray Crone, and Danny O&#x27;Connell. Schoendienst helped lead the team to its first pennant in nine years, batting .309 and finishing third in the NL MVP vote. In the World Series the Braves defeated the New York Yankees to win their only title in Milwaukee, and the franchise&#x27;s first since 1914. Milwaukee repeated as NL champions in 1958 but lost to the Yankees in their World Series rematch; Schoendienst flied out to Mickey Mantle for the Series&#x27; final out.
During the 1958–59 off-season Schoendienst was diagnosed with tuberculosis and underwent a partial pneumonectomy in February 1959. Despite being told that he would never play again, he returned to the Braves in 1960—only to be released at the end of the season. In 1961 he rejoined the Cardinals, first as a pinch hitter, then as a coach when Johnny Keane replaced Solly Hemus as the Cardinals&#x27; manager. He would remain on the Cardinals payroll in various capacities for the rest of his life. In his final three playing seasons he served as a player-coach, batting over .300 in both 1961 and 1962 and going hitless in five at-bats in 1963.

In 19 seasons as a player, Schoendienst compiled a .289 batting average with 84 home runs, 773 RBI, 1,223 runs, 2,449 hits, 427 doubles, 78 triples and 89 stolen bases in 2,216 games played. His defensive statistics as a second baseman included 4,616 putouts, 5,243 assists, 1,368 double plays, and 170 errors in 10,029 total chances for a .983 fielding average. Dark considered him &quot;the finest second baseman in the game&quot;.

==Coaching and managerial career (1964–2018)==

Keane resigned the day following the Cardinals&#x27; 1964 World Series victory over the Yankees, and Schoendienst was named as his replacement. Three years later, the Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox—Schoendienst&#x27;s fourth World Series title, and third as a Cardinal. The Cardinals repeated as champions of the National League in 1968 (the last year without divisions), but the Detroit Tigers beat them in seven games to win the World Series.

For the rest of Schoendienst&#x27;s tenure of managing a team now entrenched in the National League East, the Cardinals won ninety games just once (1971) and did not reach the postseason again, although they finished second three times in a four-year span (1971-1974). His managerial record over twelve full seasons (1965–76) and two subsequent stints as interim manager (1980 and 1990) was 1,041–955 (.522). After two years as a coach for the 1977–78 Oakland Athletics, Schoendienst returned to the Cardinals as coach and special assistant to the general manager. He won his fifth Series title in 1982. He remained an employee of the Cardinals organization with the title of Special Assistant Coach, and in 2017 completed his 72nd consecutive season as a Major League player, coach, or manager.

Schoendienst was a member of five winning World Series teams, all of which were won in seven games: as a player with the Cardinals and Braves in 1946 and 1957 respectively; as the Cardinals manager in 1967; and as a Cardinals coach in 1964 and 1982. He was also a member of three teams that lost the Series after leading three games to one: the 1958 Milwaukee Braves (to the Yankees), the 1968 Cardinals (to the Detroit Tigers), and the 1985 Cardinals (to the Kansas City Royals).

In 1989, the Veterans Committee elected Schoendienst to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Cardinals retired his number 2 in 1996. In 1998 he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame

The Cardinals named Schoendienst, among 21 other former players and personnel, to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014. The Milwaukee Braves Historical Association inducted Schoendienst into the Milwaukee Braves Honor Roll, located in Miller Park, in 2015.

==Managerial record==
==Personal life==
In 1947, Schoendienst married the former Mary Eileen O&#x27;Reilly, who died in 1999 after 52 years of marriage. The Schoendiensts had four children. He also had 10 grandchildren (though two predeceased him), and nine great-grandchildren. At the time of his death, Schoendienst lived in Town and Country, Missouri, a western suburb of St. Louis, and had served 67 of his 76 years in baseball with the Cardinals.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Schoendienst as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.

On November 13, 2017, Schoendienst, 94, became the oldest living member of the Hall of Fame when Bobby Doerr died at 99, and the oldest living manager of a World Series-winning, pennant-winning or post-season team. He was also the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1946 World Series, opposing Doerr&#x27;s Boston Red Sox team. There are no living players who played on an earlier World Series-winning team. He said of Doerr, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want him to go.&quot;

Schoendienst died at age 95 on June 6, 2018.

<doc id="639746" wikidata="Q4734714" url="?curid=639746" title="Aloysius Schmitt">
<text>Father Aloysius H. Schmitt (December 4, 1909 – December 7, 1941) was a Roman Catholic priest at the Archdiocese of Dubuque, who served as a chaplain in the United States Navy at the beginning of World War II.

==Early life and ordination==
Born in St. Lucas, Iowa to Henry and Mary Anna (Kuennen) Schmitt, Schmitt studied at Columbia College (now Loras College) in Dubuque, Iowa and graduated in 1932. He then studied in Rome for the priesthood. He was ordained on December 8, 1935. Father Schmitt was first assigned as an associate at Saint Mary&#x27;s Church in Dubuque. He was also assigned to St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Cheyenne, Wyoming. After four years, he received permission to become a chaplain, and joined the United States Navy. He was appointed Acting Chaplain with rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade (LTJG) on June 28, 1939.

==Military service and death==
On December 7, 1941, Fr. Schmitt was serving on board the battleship USS &quot;Oklahoma&quot; during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, when a hit caused the ship to capsize. A number of sailors, including Fr. Schmitt, were trapped in a compartment with only a small porthole as the means of escape. Fr. Schmitt helped a number of men through this porthole. When it came his time to leave, he declined and helped more men escape. In total, he helped 12 men escape.

Fr. Schmitt died on board the &quot; Oklahoma&quot;, and was the first chaplain from USA of any faith to have died in World War II. Most of the bodies were recovered after the ship was righted in 1943. His remains were originally buried in a cemetery in Hawaii as an &quot;Unknown.&quot; In 1944, the Navy presented a specially made crucifix to the Archdiocese of Dubuque, in honor of Chaplain Schmitt. It was 24 inches tall and was made from the teakwood deck of the &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. The corpus of Christ on the crucifix was shaped from the ship&#x27;s metal. The presentation was made by the chief of chaplains, 8th Naval district.

In 2015, the United States Department of Defense exhumed the remains of what were believed to be 388 military personnel. Schmitt&#x27;s remains were identified in 2016 from DNA taken from his skull and matched with that of a relative. They were returned to Iowa where a Memorial Mass was celebrated in his home parish of St. Luke in St. Lucas on October 5, 2016. His remains were transferred to Dubuque, where a funeral Mass and burial were held in Christ the King Chapel at Loras College on October 8, 2016.

==Awards and honors==


===Silver Star citation===

&quot;Bureau of Naval Personnel Information Bulletin No. 308 (November 1942)&quot;&lt;br&gt;

The President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Lieutenant, Junior Grade (Chaplain) Aloysius Herman Schmitt (NSN: 0-83472), United States Navy, for heroism involving voluntary risk of life not involving conflict with an armed enemy, while serving as a Chaplain on board the U.S.S. OKLAHOMA, during the attack by Japanese forces at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. Chaplain Schmitt was aboard the U.S.S. OKLAHOMA when that vessel capsized and was entrapped in a compartment where only a small porthole provided outlet for escape. With unselfish disregard for his own plight, Chaplain Schmitt assisted his shipmates through the porthole. While his shipmates were in the process of rescuing him his body became wedged in the narrow opening. Realizing that other men had come into the compartment looking for a way out, Chaplain Schmitt insisted that he be pushed back into the ship so that they might escape. Calmly urging them on with a pronouncement of his blessing, he remained behind while they crawled out to safety.

<text>The Singapura, or Kucinta in Singapore, is the smallest breed of cat, noted for its large eyes and ears, ticked coat, and blunt tail. Reportedly established from three &quot;drain cats&quot; imported from Singapore in the 1970s, it was later revealed that the cats were originally sent to Singapore from the United States before being exported back to the US. Investigations by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) concluded that no wrongdoing had occurred and the Singapura kept its status as a natural breed.

==History==
===Foundation===
In 1975, after working in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow returned to the US with what they say were three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair of male and female kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.

The Singapura was accepted for registration by the TICA in 1979 for championship competition and by CFA in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988. During this period, breeders found that the occasional litter would have a solid colored kitten, caused by the recessive gene for solid color. In a desire for the Singapura to breed true, many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with the recessive gene. It was discovered that two of the three foundation cats carried this gene.

===Controversy===
In 1987, while on a cat finding trip to Singapore, American breeder Jerry Mayes discovered importation papers which revealed that the three foundation cats were actually taken into Singapore from the US in 1974. Lucy Koh, a friend of Mayes, made efforts to correct the history of the Singapura presented by the Meadows but that went relatively unnoticed until 1990, when the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (currently Singapore Tourism Board) started a campaign to use the Singapura as a national mascot. Reporter Sandra Davie was informed of the discrepancy and published an article about it in the national broadsheet &quot;The Straits Times&quot;.

Because the cats were registered as Abyssinians in the import certificates, and because the Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, as well as the Singapura&#x27;s small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows&#x27; story.

The CFA investigated the incident at the request of a Singapura breed club. In the investigation, Hal Meadow told the investigation board that the three cats were grandchildren of four local cats he sent back to the US during a previous sensitive business trip to Singapore in 1971, contradicting the Meadows&#x27; earlier claim of the foundation cats&#x27; origin. Apparently Tommy Meadow lied about it to conceal the secret trip. The CFA found no wrongdoing and kept the Singapura&#x27;s status as a natural breed. CFA&#x27;s Joan Miller said that &quot;Whether they mated on the streets of Singapore or whether they mated in Michigan, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.&quot; Referring to the cat picked up from the SPCA in 1981, she said that &quot;In addition, there is at least one documented cat that is behind many Singapura pedigrees and it was picked up at the pound. Even with none of the cats the Meadows brought in we still have a legitimate cat from Singapore behind our Singapuras.&quot;

Recent studies in 2007 based on feline DNA showed that there are very few genetic differences between the Singapura and Burmese, adding support to the claim that the Singapura is not a natural breed.

===Singapuras in Singapore===

The Singapore Tourist and Promotion Board (STPB) proceeded with the decision to use the breed (advertised under the name Kucinta) as a tourism mascot after CFA concluded its investigation. The name Kucinta is an amalgamation of the Malay words &quot;kucing&quot; (cat) and &quot;cinta&quot; (love) and taken from the winning entry in a naming competition. Incidentally, Kucinta also means &quot;The one I love&quot; in Malay. Sculptures of the Singapura can be found by the Singapore River.
While in Singapore brown moggies with ticked coats can occasionally be seen, few if any resemble the Singapura, with the majority of cats being bobtailed tabbies, tortoiseshells or bicolor, and the move by the STPB is seen by locals to be an advertising move based on the popularity of the breed among tourists at that time.

In 2004, the Singapore Zoo hosted a temporary exhibit of Singapura cats in celebration of the nation&#x27;s 39th National Day. Four Singapura cats were loaned by their owners for the event.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
The Singapura is moderately stocky and muscular with a very short and fine coat. The world&#x27;s smallest cat breed, a full-grown female usually weighs while the male weighs . The large, slightly pointed, and deep cupped ears together with the large almond-shaped eyes are characteristics of the breed. The tail is slender, slightly shorter than the length of the body and has a blunt tip.

The breed&#x27;s coat pattern is that of a ticked tabby. That is, individual hair strands have alternating sections of dark and light color, typically two dark bands separated by two light bands, with a dark color at the tip. The underside, including the chest, muzzle and chin, takes the color of the light bands. The Singapura is recognized by cat registries in only one color, the sepia agouti, described as &quot;dark brown ticking on a warm old ivory ground color&quot;.

==Health==
Of concern to breeders is the condition known as uterine inertia, an inability to expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present in one of the foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice. A test is available that can determine whether a cat is affected, a carrier, or clear of the disease. Singapuras with PKD can usually live a normal life.

Some breeders have shown concern regarding the lack of genetic diversity in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool. Researchers who completed the 2007 DNA study found that the Singapura (along with the Burmese) have the least genetic diversity among the 22 breeds studied. The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around the world that are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK&#x27;s Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.

The Singapura has one of the lowest heterozygosity values.

<text>Eastern Illinois University (EIU) is a public university in Charleston, Illinois, United States. Established in 1895 as the Eastern Illinois State Normal School, a teacher&#x27;s college offering a two-year degree, Eastern Illinois University gradually expanded into a comprehensive university with a broad curriculum, including bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in education, business, arts, sciences, and humanities.

==History==
Eastern Illinois Normal School was established by the Illinois State Legislature in 1895 &quot;to train teachers for the schools of East Central Illinois.&quot; A 40-acre campus was acquired in Charleston and the first building was commissioned. When the school began classes in 1899, there were 125 students and an 18-member faculty.

The first building was finished in 1899 and is called Old Main, though it is formally named the Livingston C. Lord Administration Building in honor of EIU&#x27;s first president, who served from 1899 to 1933. Built of Indiana limestone in a heavy Gothic revival style with turrets, towers, and battlements, its distinctive outline is the official symbol of the school. Old Main is one of &quot;Altgeld&#x27;s castles&quot;, five buildings built in the 1890s at the major Illinois state colleges. Governor John Peter Altgeld was instrumental in funding the Illinois university system, and he was especially fond of the Gothic style. Eastern&#x27;s &quot;Old Main&quot; and Illinois State University&#x27;s Cook Hall are the only schools where the &quot;castle&quot; is not named after Altgeld. Other original Gothic Revival buildings include Booth Library and Blair Hall. Blair Hall was restored after a disastrous fire in 2004. In fall 2008, the university opened the newly constructed Doudna Fine Arts Center, designed by international architect Antoine Predock. The complex houses the music, theatre, and visual arts departments.

Through the twentieth century, the school changed its name several times in order to reflect its transition from a teachers college into a multi-purpose institution that could be of wider service to Illinois. Thus, Eastern Illinois State Normal School became Eastern Illinois State Teachers College in 1921, which then became Eastern Illinois State College in 1947. In 1957, the Illinois General Assembly changed the name of the institution to Eastern Illinois University.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the university celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2020.

Additional fees amount to $3,506.68. The university estimates its average cost-of-attendance to be approximately $24,640 per academic year. The university has an endowment of approximately $108 million. The president of the university since 2023 is Jay Gatrell.

Eastern Illinois University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation. Eastern Illinois also offers 51 undergraduate degree programs; 32 graduate degree programs; and 10 post-baccalaureate certificate programs.

Eastern is divided into four colleges:
* College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
* Lumpkin College of Business &amp; Technology
* College of Education
* College of Health &amp; Human Services

Other academic divisions include the Graduate School, Sandra &amp; Jack Pine Honors College, and the School of Extended Learning. The Graduate School was founded in 1951 and has an enrollment of approximately 1,800 full and part-time students with more than 300 faculty holding graduate faculty status. The university also includes the Center for Academic Support and Achievement, the Office of Inclusion and Academic Engagement, the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, and the Office of Study Abroad. The university&#x27;s Booth Library hosts yearly exhibits, the Ballenger Teachers Center, and numerous digital collections. The main university art museum, the Tarble Arts Center, maintains a 1,000-piece permanent collection, including a 500-piece collection of late 20th-century Illinois folk arts and related archival information. A majority of the holdings are concentrated on art from the state of Illinois and the Midwest region.

===Reputation and rankings===
In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings, Eastern Illinois University was ranked 54th out of 165 regional universities in the Midwest.

==Student life==
Eastern Illinois University offers over 170 student organizations, ranging from religious, multicultural, service, academic, Greek, honorary, governing, social, athletic and political organizations.

===Alma mater===
The &quot;EIU Alma Mater&quot; song was composed by Friederich Koch during his tenure as a music teacher at Eastern. The lyrics were composed as a poem titled &quot;For Us Arose Thy Walls and Towers&quot; by Isabel McKinney, a professor of English at Eastern from 1911 to 1945. These lyrics were originally set to the German folk tune Die Wacht am Rhein (The Watch on the Rhine), but were changed around the time of World War I due to anti-German sentiments at the time.

===Media===
The student newspaper is &quot;The Daily Eastern News&quot;, founded in 1915; EIU is said to be one of the smallest universities in the country to have a daily newspaper.

The university&#x27;s student-run radio station is Hit-Mix 88.9 WEIU.

WEIU-TV is a PBS station on the campus of Eastern Illinois University. The student-run news program is News Watch.

===Residential life===
There are eleven on-campus residence halls.

Ruth Carman Hall was a former residence. It was named after Ruth Carman, an EIU alumna.

Carman Hall opened on September 4, 1970, but wasn&#x27;t officially completed until November 14, 1971. Initially, the housing office was unable to fill the upper two floors of the building, but by 1977 the entire building was in use. From August 2011, only eight floors were occupied due to reduced enrollment. Carman Hall was closed after May 30, 2013, to allow for an assessment of the condition of the building and for future renovation. In 2014, the university stated that it would remain closed as a cost-saving measure due to low enrollment.

Since closure, the building has been used for training purposes by EIU&#x27;s Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps as well as high-rise rescue training by various area fire departments.

Eastern Illinois University features two residence hall dining centers (Taylor and Stevenson), the University Food Court with six fast food locations, Java Beanery &amp; Bakery (Java B &amp; B), Chick-fil-A, Charleston Market, Panther Grille, Ace Sushi, Qdoba, and two Marketplace Convenience Centers. They also operate a restaurant-style option (Reservation-Only Dining) on the weekends.

==Athletics==

Eastern Illinois University&#x27;s colors are blue and grey; the sports teams&#x27; mascot is the Panther. The teams participate in NCAA Division I (I-AA FCS for football) in the Ohio Valley Conference. Eastern Illinois University was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1912 to 1970.

The football team is coached by Chris Wilkerson and competes at home in O’Brien Field.

Current National Football League head coach, Sean Payton of the Denver Broncos, is an alumnus of Eastern Illinois. Brad Childress, head coach of the Minnesota Vikings from 2006 to 2010, is also a graduate, preceding Sean Payton at Eastern Illinois. Additionally, Tony Romo, the former starting quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys, and Jimmy Garoppolo, starting quarterback of the Las Vegas Raiders, are alumni of the university.

Eastern Illinois is also the host of the IHSA Boys and Girls State Track and Field Finals, which have been held at O&#x27;Brien Field since the 1970s. They also host the IHSA Girls State Badminton Finals and previously hosted the State Journalism Finals.

<doc id="639754" wikidata="Q42720" url="?curid=639754" title="Turkish Angora">
<text>The Turkish Angora (, &#x27;Ankara cat&#x27;) is a breed of domestic cat. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, natural breeds of cat, having originated in central Anatolia (Ankara Province in modern-day Turkey). The breed has been documented as early as the 17th century. Outside of the United States, the breed is usually referred to as simply the Angora or Ankara cat. These cats have slender and elegant bodies.

==History==
Like all domestic cats, Turkish Angoras descended from the African wildcat (&quot;Felis lybica&quot;). Their ancestors were among the cats that were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent.

Longhaired cats were imported to Britain and France from Asia Minor, Persia and Russia as early as the late 16th century. The Turkish Angora was recognised as a distinct breed in Europe by the 17th century. However, there is a strong connection between Angoras and Persians. Charles Catton, in the 1788 book &quot;Animals Drawn from Nature and Engraved in Aqua-tinta&quot;, gave “Persian cat” and “Angora cat” as alternative names for the same breed.

There is a lot of similarity between Angora and Persian cat. Angora by British and American . In 1903, Frances Simpson wrote in &quot;The Book of the Cat&quot;:

The Angora of the 20th century was used for improvement in the Persian coat, but the type has always been divergent from the Persianparticularly as the increasingly flat-faced show cat Persian has been developed in the last few decades.

In the early 20th century, Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo began a breeding program to protect and preserve pure white Angoras. The zoo particularly prized odd-eyed specimens; however, the cats were chosen only for their colourno other criterion was applied.

The Turkish Angora, which was brought to Canada in 1963, was accepted as a championship pedigreed breed in 1973 by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association. However, until 1978 only white Angoras were recognised. Today, all North American registries accept the Turkish Angora in many colours and patterns. While their numbers are still relatively small, the gene pool is continually growing.

== Characteristics ==
=== Appearance ===
The Angora has a silky coat that covers a long muscular body. Though it is known for a shimmery white coat and posh tail, Turkish Angoras can display a variety of coat colours, with the only disallowed coats being chocolate, lavender, or colourpoint. The Angora&#x27;s head is small to medium in size with a smooth wedge. The body is long and slender, with good fineness of the bone.

Eyes are large and almond shaped. The colour may be blue, green, amber, yellow, as well as heterochromatic. Ears are pointed, large and wide-set. The eyes are almond shaped, and the profile forms two straight planes. The plumed tail is often carried upright, perpendicular to the back.

=== Behaviour ===
Turkish Angoras are playful, intelligent, athletic and involved. They bond with humans, but often select a particular member of a family to be their constant companion, whom they are very protective of.
==Health==
The gene responsible for blue eyes and white coat in the Angora can cause deafness.
There have been reports of kittens suffering from ataxia as well as adult cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

==Genetic variations==
Breeders in Turkey feel that the cat&#x27;s fine-boned version of its natural breed is unrepresentative of the true Turkish cats, which are much sturdier. American &quot;Turkish&quot; Angoras have only a minimal remnant of the original Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo DNA, and are only &quot;purebred on paper&quot;.

A genetic study of pedigree cat breeds (using DNA taken from pedigreed cats in the U.S. and Europe) and worldwide random-bred populations showed the Turkish Van as a distinct population from the Turkish Angora despite their geographical association. The Turkish Angora was grouped with the pedigreed Egyptian Mau and random-bred Tunisian cats. Turkish random-bred cats were grouped with Israeli random-bred cats, while the Turkish Van was grouped with Egyptian random-bred cats.
However, the UC Davis studied only American cat fancy registered Angoras rather than the &quot;true&quot; Turkish Angora or Ankara Kedisi directly from Turkey, and especially from the Ankara Zoo.

A genetic study published in 2012 included a few cats imported from Turkey. The study found that &quot;Turkish-versus USA-originating Turkish Angoras ... are resolved as separate breed populations.&quot; The American Turkish Angoras are categorised as descendants of European random-bred cats, and cats imported from Turkey &quot;were assigned to the Eastern Mediterranean&quot; group.

<doc id="639761" wikidata="Q727901" url="?curid=639761" title="Reelfoot Lake">
<text>Reelfoot Lake is a shallow natural lake located in the northwest portion of the U.S. state of Tennessee, in Lake and Obion Counties. Much of it is swamp-like, with bayou-like ditches (some natural, some man-made) connecting more open bodies of water called basins, the largest of which is called Blue Basin. Reelfoot Lake is noted for its bald cypress trees and its nesting pairs of bald eagles.

Public use of the lake and grounds has been preserved since it was acquired by the state of Tennessee in the early 20th century and the area was established as Reelfoot Lake State Park. Lake Isom, a similar, smaller lake to the immediate south, has been designated as a National Wildlife Refuge area. In 1966, Reelfoot Lake was designated as a national natural landmark by the National Park Service.

==History==

According to the United States Geological Survey, Reelfoot Lake was formed in northwestern Tennessee when the region subsided during the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes, which were centered around New Madrid, Missouri. The earthquakes resulted in several major changes in the landforms over a widespread area, with shocks being felt as far away as Quebec, Canada.

A land survey begun by Henry Rutherford in 1785 identified the existent waterway as the Reelfoot River. The now extinct river flowed into the Mississippi River prior to the earthquakes of 1811 and 1812. Jedidiah Morse, in 1797, described the river as 30 yards wide, 7 miles from the mouth. Eliza Bryan, an eyewitness to the earthquakes, wrote in 1816 from Missouri Territory that an enormous lake had grown on the other side of the Mississippi River:

Samuel Cole Williams argued Bryan&#x27;s dimensions were a &quot;fantastic exaggeration typical of that time of excitement.&quot; On early maps, the new lake sometimes took the names of Line Lake (a reference to the state boundary) or Wood Lake. By 1834, Reelfoot River was identified as a north fork of the Obion River. The regional body of water then identified as Wood Lake was located from the north line of Obion county extending south as a marshy swamp. Much of the old lower portion of the Bayou de Chien is submerged in the lake. The Mississippi River beheaded the Bayou de Chien near Hickman, Kentucky while the remaining southern portion feeds Reelfoot Lake along with contributions from Reelfoot Creek and Indian Creek.

Radiocarbon dating of artifacts from the Otto Sharpe site indicate a Native American presence in the Reelfoot Lake Basin around 1650 AD. The site includes European artifacts. Willard Rouse Jillson suggested the Reelfoot River Basin as the location of the Monsoupelea settlement during Jacques Marquette&#x27;s exploration of the Mississippi River in 1673. An archaeological investigation for the Army Corps of Engineers in 1987 stated that Henry Rutherford&#x27;s survey party encountered a small Native American settlement near the Bayou de Chien, and named the river Reelfoot for the local leader of the village.

===Early cartography===

===Legend===

According to legend, the Reelfoot River, which gave its name to the lake, is said to be named for an Indian chief who had a deformed foot and was nicknamed &quot;Reelfoot&quot; by settlers in the early 19th century. A non-Chickasaw (The Chickasaw Nation Historical Society does not claim him) legend states that the name originated from a prince of a Chickasaw tribe inhabiting the present West Tennessee, who was born with a deformed foot and walked with a rolling motion, so was nicknamed &quot;Kolopin,&quot; meaning Reelfoot. When he became chief, Reelfoot determined to marry a Choctaw princess, but her father would not permit it. The Great Spirit warned Reelfoot that if he attempted to kidnap the maiden, his village and his people would be destroyed. Reelfoot disobeyed the Spirit, and seized the princess by force and carried her to Chickasaw territory, where he arranged a marriage ceremony.

In the middle of the ceremony, the Great Spirit stamped his foot in anger, causing the earth to quake, and the Father of the Waters raised the Mississippi River over its banks, inundating Reelfoot&#x27;s homeland. The water flowed into the imprint left by the Spirit&#x27;s foot, forming a beautiful lake, beneath which Reelfoot, his bride, and his people lie buried. Though the legend is about the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes that once inhabited the area, these tribes left around the early 14th century, reserving this area as hunting grounds.

Other origins are also cited, for example, in his 1911 story &quot;Fishhead&quot;, Irvin S. Cobb claimed the lake &quot;[took] its name from a fancied resemblance in its outline to the splayed, reeled foot of a cornfield Negro.&quot;

==20th century Night Riders==
Original landowners and their descendants retained title to ground under the water, but local people grew used to treating it as a common resource. Farmers, fishermen, and landowners all derived their livelihoods from the lake and nearby lands. In the early 20th century, however, outside parties began to try to take over control of the lake and its lands. A group of investors bought up most of the land around the shoreline, and organized as the West Tennessee Land Company. In this period, major planters in both Kentucky and Tennessee, sometimes based in cities, were also expanding large-scale cotton cultivation into this area.

Beginning in the spring of 1908, the Reelfoot area was marked by widespread lawlessness in western Kentucky and Tennessee as farmers and residents organized as Night Riders to resist the acquisition by the West Tennessee Land Company of the lake and surrounding lands. They were also reacting to the expansion of large-scale cotton production into this area, which had been dominated by yeomen farmers.

The troubles began when a group of landowners purchased almost the entire shoreline of the lake. They formed the West Tennessee Land Company to enforce what they saw to be their legal rights, including the ownership of the lake, and most importantly its fishing rights. Most of the Night Riders were from families who had derived much of their living from fishing the lake for generations, joined by their friends and supporters. They expanded the reach of their violence, expressing other social tensions by attacking and threatening Black individuals and families in the area. A mob of 50 masked Night Riders lynched all seven members of the David Walker family on the night of October 3, 1908, in Fulton County, Kentucky. The lynchings received national coverage and Governor Augustus E. Willson strongly condemned the murders, but no one was ever prosecuted for them.

Related violence by Night Riders in Tennessee culminated on October 19, 1908, with the kidnapping of two White attorneys, engaged by the West Tennessee Land Company to enforce its claims: Captain Quentin Rankin, also a shareholder in the company, was lynched by being hanged and shot; Colonel R. Z. Taylor was wounded, but escaped by swimming across the lake in the dark. As reported by the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;, Taylor escaped, although he was initially reported as killed. His grandson was author Peter Taylor.

Governor Malcolm Rice Patterson of Tennessee directed an investigation of Rankin&#x27;s murder and ordered in the state militia to suppress the violence. Hundreds of suspects were arrested, and six men were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder.

The governor soon declared the lake to be part of the public domain; the legislature authorized acquisition in 1909, but court challenges over the rights at low water delayed full acquisition for years. The state finally acquired the land and lake, years after constructing levees from 1917 to 1920 to maintain the water level to settle property-rights issues. The Tennessee State Park and Forestry Commission was ordered to determine the precise boundaries and was ultimately given responsibility for this and other state parks, to guarantee public use. A system of parks, wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and public boat ramps has been developed through federal-state cooperation.

==Reelfoot Lake today==
Reelfoot Lake currently covers , with a maximum depth of and an average depth of . It is the only large natural lake in Tennessee. Lake County, Tennessee, in which it is located, was named for it. Until 2003, Reelfoot was the world&#x27;s only legal commercial fishery for crappie, a species of sunfish. It was served in restaurants near the shore. The area is popular for recreational boating, fishing, and waterfowl hunting.

Since 1930, water levels in the lake have been regulated by the construction and operation of a spillway at the southern end, where the Running Reelfoot Bayou flows out of it. This structure was controversial when first built. In 1939 local residents attempted to blow it up, unsuccessfully.

In the early 21st century, the 80-year-old spillway was regarded as obsolete by both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. They planned to replace it. A new spillway was completed in 2013 and became operational. This has helped regulate water levels and by doing so, helped the overall health of the lake and its species. 

The town of Samburg, Tennessee, is the only incorporated municipality on the lake&#x27;s shores.

The story of the formation of Reelfoot Lake is told through an earthquake simulator program at Discovery Park of America, a museum 14 miles from the lake in Union City, Tennessee.

==Representation in other media==
Reelfoot Lake was a filming site for three movie productions: the 1957 drama &quot;Raintree County&quot;, the 1967 Oscar-winner &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, and 1998&#x27;s &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot;.

<text>All stars but one can be associated with an IAU (International Astronomical Union) constellation. IAU constellations are areas of the sky. Although there are only 88 IAU constellations, the sky is actually divided into 89 irregularly shaped boxes as the constellation Serpens is split into two separate sections, Serpens Caput (the snake&#x27;s head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (the snake&#x27;s tail) to the east.

The only star that does not belong to a constellation is the Sun. The Sun travels through the 13 constellations along the ecliptic, the 12 of the Zodiac and Ophiuchus.

Among the remaining stars, the nearer ones exhibit proper motion, so it is only a matter of time before some of them cross a constellation boundary and switch constellations as a consequence. In 1992, Rho Aquilae became the first star to have its Bayer designation &quot;invalidated&quot; by moving to a neighbouring constellation—it is now a star of the constellation Delphinus.

<text>The Holmdel Horn Antenna is a large microwave horn antenna that was used as a satellite communication antenna and radio telescope during the 1960s at the Bell Telephone Laboratories facility located on Crawford Hill in Holmdel Township, New Jersey, United States. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989 because of its association with the research work of two radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson.

In 1965, while using this antenna, Penzias and Wilson discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) that permeates the universe. This was one of the most important discoveries in physical cosmology since Edwin Hubble demonstrated in the 1920s that the universe was expanding. It provided the evidence that confirmed George Gamow&#x27;s and Georges Lemaître&#x27;s &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory of the creation of the universe. This helped change the science of cosmology, the study of the universe&#x27;s history, from a field for unlimited theoretical speculation into a discipline of direct observation. In 1978 Penzias and Wilson received the Nobel Prize for Physics for their discovery.

== Description ==

The horn antenna at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, was constructed on Crawford Hill in 1959 to support Project Echo, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s passive communications satellites, which used large aluminized plastic balloons (satellite balloon) as reflectors to bounce radio signals from one point on the Earth to another.

The antenna is in length with a radiating aperture of and is constructed of aluminum. The antenna&#x27;s elevation wheel, which surrounds the midsection of the horn, is in diameter and supports the structure&#x27;s weight using rollers mounted on a base frame. All axial or thrust loads are taken by a large ball bearing at the narrow apex end of the horn. The horn continues through this bearing into the equipment building or cab. The ability to locate receiver equipment at the horn apex, thus eliminating the noise contribution of a connecting line, is an important feature of the antenna. A radiometer for measuring the intensity of radiant energy is located in the cab.

The triangular base frame of the antenna is made from structural steel. It rotates on wheels about a center pintle ball bearing on a turntable track in diameter. The track consists of stress-relieved, planed steel plates individually adjusted to produce a track that is flat to about . The faces of the wheels are cone-shaped to minimize contact friction. A tangential force of 100 pounds (400 N) is sufficient to start the antenna rotating on the turntable. The antenna beam can be directed to any part of the sky using the turntable for azimuth adjustments and the elevation wheel to change the elevation angle or altitude above the horizon.

Except for the steel base frame, which a local steel company made, the Holmdel Laboratory shops fabricated and assembled the antenna under the direction of Mr. H. W. Anderson, who also collaborated on the design. Assistance in the design was also given by Messrs. R. O&#x27;Regan and S. A. Darby. Construction of the antenna was completed under the direction of Arthur Crawford.

When not in use, the turntable azimuth sprocket drive is disengaged, allowing the structure to &quot;weathervane&quot; and seek a position of minimum wind resistance. The antenna was designed to withstand winds of , and the entire structure weighs 18 short tons (16 tonnes).

A plastic clapboarded utility shed with two windows, a double door, and a sheet-metal roof, is located on the ground next to the antenna. This structure houses equipment and controls for the antenna and is included as a part of the designation as a National Historic Landmark. 

The antenna has not been used for several decades. 

==Technical==
This type of antenna is called a Hogg or horn-reflector antenna, invented by Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941. It was built by David C. Hogg. It consists of a flaring metal horn with a curved reflecting surface mounted in its mouth at a 45° angle to the long axis of the horn. The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, so the antenna is a parabolic antenna that is fed off-axis. A Hogg horn combines several characteristics useful for radio astronomy. It is extremely broad-band, has calculable aperture efficiency, and the walls of the horn shield it from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis. Therefore, the back and side lobes are so minimal that scarcely any thermal energy is received from the ground. Consequently, it is an ideal radio telescope for accurately measuring low levels of weak background radiation. The antenna has a gain of about 43.3 dBi and a beamwidth of about 1.5° at 2.39 GHz and an aperture efficiency of 76%.

==Preservation==
In 2021, the Crawford Hill site was sold to a developer who was interested in building a residential development. In reaction, this triggered a &quot;Save Holmdel&#x27;s Horn Antenna&quot; petition to preserve the property as a park. Advocates felt that a better fate than the horn antenna or its site encountering destruction to make way for a planned real estate development.

As of October 2023, the site is now planned to be preserved. After public support for the preservation of the horn antenna emerged—demonstrated in part by more than 8,000 signatures on a petition disseminated by community groups—the Holmdel Township Committee agreed to pay $5.5 million for of land, including that which the antenna sits on. The town plans to turn the land into a public park.

<text>Bruce Phillip Smith (February 8, 1920 – August 28, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Boo&quot;, was an American football halfback. He played college football for the Minnesota Golden Gophers, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1941.

Smith was born in Faribault, Minnesota, where he excelled in high school football under the coach Win Brockmeyer at Faribault High School. The football field at Faribault High is now named after Smith. He attended the University of Minnesota, playing for the back-to-back national champion Gophers in 1940 and 1941. Smith was captain of the 1941 Minnesota team. Smith earned first-team All-American and All-Big Ten Conference honors in 1941.

During World War II, he served as a United States Navy fighter pilot. After the war, he played in the National Football League (NFL) with the Green Bay Packers (1945–1948) and the Los Angeles Rams (1948).

The movie &quot;Smith of Minnesota&quot; was released in 1942. The premiere occurred in his home town of Faribault, Minnesota, to the amazement of the locals due to this novelty. However, laughter was heard in the movie house when certain advanced technologies, for that time (direct-dial phones, streetlights, etc.) were seen as part of the scenery—courtesy of being filmed in Hollywood, Los Angeles.

Smith was diagnosed with cancer in the spring of 1967, and he spent the next several months visiting young cancer patients with the Rev. William Cantwell. Smith lost over half his body weight before succumbing to the disease. Cantwell, who was unfamiliar with Smith&#x27;s sports achievements, nominated Smith for sainthood.

In 1972, Smith was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. His number 54 was the first to be officially retired by the Minnesota Gophers in 1977.

<doc id="639777" wikidata="Q1572184" url="?curid=639777" title="Desperado (Eagles album)">
<text>Desperado is the second studio album by the American rock band the Eagles, released on April 17, 1973, by Asylum Records. The album was produced by Glyn Johns and was recorded at Island Studios in London, England. The songs on &quot;Desperado&quot; are based on the themes of the Old West. The band members are featured on the album&#x27;s cover dressed like an outlaw gang; &quot;Desperado&quot; remains the only Eagles album where the band members appear on the front cover.

Although the title track is one of the Eagles&#x27; signature songs, it was never released as a single. The song &quot;Desperado&quot; was ranked number 494 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 2004 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. The album did yield two singles, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Outlaw Man&quot;, which reached number 64 and number 59 respectively. The album reached number 41 on the Billboard album chart and was certified gold by the RIAA on September 23, 1974, and double platinum on March 20, 2001. In 2000, &quot;Desperado&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

&quot;Desperado&quot; was the last Asylum Records album to be distributed in North America by Atlantic Records (catalog no. SD 5068), prior to Asylum&#x27;s mid-1973 merger with Elektra Records by Asylum&#x27;s, Elektra&#x27;s and Atlantic&#x27;s parent company, Warner Communications.

==Background==

===Theme===
After a commercially successful first album, Frey wanted the second album to be one with which they could be taken seriously as artists, and became interested in making a concept album. The original concept was for songs about anti-heroes; according to Glenn Frey, he was jamming together with Don Henley, Jackson Browne, and JD Souther after a Tim Hardin concert when they had the idea of doing an album about anti-heroes. One inspiration was a book on gunfighters of the Wild West given to Browne by Ned Doheny for his 21st birthday, and Browne showed them the book and suggested the theme. The book includes stories about Bill Dalton and Bill Doolin; from this came the song &quot;Doolin-Dalton&quot; about the Doolin-Dalton Gang. However, they ran out of ideas after writing &quot;Doolin-Dalton&quot; and &quot;James Dean&quot; about the eponymous actor. The idea for anti-heroes then became the Western-themed &quot;Desperado&quot;, and the song &quot;James Dean&quot; would be used for the next album &quot;On the Border&quot; instead.

Jackson Browne himself credited the song &quot;Desperado&quot; written by Frey and Henley, as the origin of the outlaw theme of the album. Bernie Leadon said that Frey liked the idea of an analogy between outlaw gangs and rock-and-roll: &quot;Glenn sat everybody down and mapped out which characters in the gang could have songs written about them, or encouraged us to write songs about this concept.&quot; As Frey said of the album in an interview in 1973: &quot;It has its moments where it definitely draws some parallels between rock-and-roll and being an outlaw. Outside the laws of normality, I guess. I mean, I feel like I&#x27;m breaking a law all the time. What we live and what we do is kind of a fantasy.&quot; Henley also said that the album was to be their &quot;big artistic commentary on the evils of fame and success, with a cowboy metaphor.&quot; However, he admitted: &quot;The metaphor was probably a little bullshit. We were in L.A. staying up all night, smoking dope, living the California life, and I suppose we thought it was as radical as cowboys in the old West. We were really rebelling against the music business, not society.&quot; Part of the reasons for their dissatisfaction and cynicism with the music business was due to David Geffen selling his independent Asylum label to Warner Communications which then merged it with Elektra, and the band attributed this as the reason for the lack of interest in promoting the band internationally by EMI.

===Compositions===
Frey and Henley decided that they should write songs together after they recorded their first album &quot;Eagles&quot; in London in 1972, and the first songs they wrote together days after they returned to Los Angeles were &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, both written within the first week of their collaboration. The other songs in the album quickly came together after they had decided on the Western theme. While &quot;Desperado&quot; does not have a specific narrative, and the songs do not all necessarily fit in with the theme explicitly, the album has been described as being &quot;suffused with the atmosphere of the open plains and a tough, peculiarly male kind of loneliness&quot; that can &quot;trick the listener into believing they are&quot; tied to the theme. 

This album is the beginning of the songwriting partnership of Frey and Henley; in all Frey and Henley were involved in writing eight of the eleven songs in the album. Henley noted: &quot;That’s when we became a team.&quot; The songwriting prowess of Frey and Henley in &quot;Desperado&quot; also marks the beginning of their dominance in the band. Henley said in retrospect: &quot;That was a real crucial time for us. When we formed the band, it was supposed to be one of those &#x27;everybody&#x27;s equal&#x27; affairs. We&#x27;d all sing and all write and so forth. But the fact is people aren&#x27;t all going to be able to do everything the same. It&#x27;s just like on a football team . . . . Some people quarterback and some people block. So we went through a lot of hassles for a while.&quot;

Leadon wrote two songs – &quot;Twenty-One&quot; and &quot;Bitter Creek&quot; – while Randy Meisner co-wrote &quot;Certain Kind of Fool&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. &quot;Twenty-One&quot; refers to the age of Emmett Dalton, the youngest of the Dalton gang, when he was shot 23 times but survived during the raid on Coffeyville, Kansas, in October 1892. Meisner came up with the idea for how someone became an outlaw in &quot;Certain Kind of Fool&quot;, wrote most of it, and said of his contribution: &quot;I kinda started it. And that&#x27;s what usually happened – I&#x27;d get a verse or two, and I&#x27;m done, and they would help fill in the blanks&quot; The only song on the album not written by the band members of Eagles is &quot;Outlaw Man&quot;, which was written by David Blue and chosen because it fit the theme.

===Recording===
The album was recorded at the Island Studios in London, which took four weeks at a cost of £30,000. The producer Glyn Johns wanted to produce the album quickly and economically, each track was therefore limited to four or five takes, and requests to record more were refused. Henley would later state that his greatest regret was that he did not sing as well as he could on the title track &quot;Desperado&quot;, and would have liked to redo the song. According to the producer Johns, he and Leadon tried to come up with a few musical links in an attempt to tie up the story for an outlaw concept in the album; however, the concept itself dissipated. The band was very happy with the finished result; after Johns had played the album back to them as an entity for the first time, they carried him on their shoulders out of the control room.

However, the finished recording was received poorly by Jerry Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records, who said: &quot;Jeez, they&#x27;ve made a fucking cowboy album!&quot;

The film director Sam Peckinpah had planned to use the album as the basis for a film, but the plan did not come to fruition.

==Artwork==

The artwork for the album was done by artist Gary Burden with photos by Henry Diltz, both of whom were also responsible for Eagles&#x27; first album. To illustrate the theme for the music in the album, the original concept was for a gatefold album with the band dressed as outlaws on the front cover with images of gunfight and the Wild West inside. The centerfold idea, however, was scrapped by David Geffen.

On the back of the album is an image of all four members of the band together with Jackson Browne and JD Souther lying dead and bound on the ground. A posse stands over them, including the producer Glyn Johns (far right in a white hat), manager John Hartmann, road manager Tommy Nixon, artist Boyd Elder (who would be responsible for the skull artwork of Eagles&#x27; later albums), roadies, and Gary Burden (far left). The photo is meant to be a reenactment of the historical image of the capture and death of the Dalton Gang. Jackson Browne said that the image on the back cover with the musicians lying dead is when the &quot;whole thing really comes together&quot;.

The photo shoot took place at the Paramount Ranch, an old film set for Western movies in Malibu Canyon. It was, however, an expensive shoot, and to justify the cost a promotional film for the album was also made at the same time. The film was shot on Super-8, then sepia-tinted, and transferred to videotape. In each process a little video quality is lost, which Frey described as a &quot;nice accident&quot; as it made the video appear aged and more realistic. Henley described the promotional film, like the album itself, as &quot;a commentary on [their] loss of innocence with regard to how the music business really worked&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Paul Gambaccini of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a positive review on its release in 1973. He wrote: &quot;The beautiful thing about it is that although it is a unified set of songs, it is not a rock opera, a concept album, or anything pretending to be much more than a set of good tunes that just happen to fit together.&quot; In conclusion, he wrote: &quot;&quot;Desperado&quot; won&#x27;t cure your hangover or revalue the dollar, but it will give you many good times. With their second consecutive job well done, the Eagles are on a winning streak.&quot; Robert Christgau, however, took the view that &quot;with its barstool-macho equation of gunslinger and guitarschlonger, its on-the-road misogyny, its playing-card metaphors, and its paucity of decent songs, this soundtrack to an imaginary Sam Peckinpah movie is &quot;concept&quot; at its most mindless.&quot; AllMusic editor William Ruhlmann praised that Henley had more involvement with the album, but wrote that it &quot;was simultaneously more ambitious and serious-minded than its predecessor and also slighter and less consistent.&quot;

The album is now considered by some critics to be one of the significant albums of country rock. Music writer John Einarson argued in his book &quot;Desperados: The Roots of Country Rock&quot; that despite its weak initial sales, the album &quot;would set the tone for all the later soft country rock sounds, and impact what would become the foundation of &#x27;new country&#x27;, in both image and music.&quot;
It was voted number 631 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Sterling Whitaker rated both &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Doolin-Dalton&quot; as being among the Eagles&#x27; 10 most underrated songs.

==Commercial performance==

Released in April 1973, the album was not a commercial success initially. It debuted on the US Billboard 200 chart at a lowly number 145 on its week of its release, rising to number 41 in its eighth week on the chart, It remains Eagles&#x27; lowest charting album and it produced no hit song, as both singles released from the album, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Outlaw Man&quot;, failed to reach top 50 on the main singles chart.

However, the success of their next album release, &quot;On the Border&quot;, as well as subsequent releases, spurred on the sales of the album. It was certified Gold on September 23, 1974 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) after the release of &quot;On the Border&quot;, followed by a double platinum certification on March 20, 2001, indicating shipment of 2 million copies in the United States.

<doc id="639778" wikidata="Q10370880" url="?curid=639778" title="Hilbert's sixth problem">
<text>Hilbert&#x27;s sixth problem is to axiomatize those branches of physics in which mathematics is prevalent. It occurs on the widely cited list of Hilbert&#x27;s problems in mathematics that he presented in the year 1900. In its common English translation, the explicit statement reads:

:6. Mathematical Treatment of the Axioms of Physics. The investigations on the foundations of geometry suggest the problem: &quot;To treat in the same manner, by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which already today mathematics plays an important part; in the first rank are the theory of probabilities and mechanics.&quot;

Hilbert gave the further explanation of this problem and its possible specific forms:

:&quot;As to the axioms of the theory of probabilities, it seems to me desirable that their logical investigation should be accompanied by a rigorous and satisfactory development of the method of mean values in mathematical physics, and in particular in the kinetic theory of gases. ... Boltzmann&#x27;s work on the principles of mechanics suggests the problem of developing mathematically the limiting processes, there merely indicated, which lead from the atomistic view to the laws of motion of continua.&quot;

==History==
David Hilbert himself devoted much of his research to the sixth problem; in particular, he worked in those fields of physics that arose after he stated the problem.

In the 1910s, celestial mechanics evolved into general relativity. Hilbert and Emmy Noether corresponded extensively with Albert Einstein on the formulation of the theory.

In the 1920s, mechanics of microscopic systems evolved into quantum mechanics. Hilbert, with the assistance of John von Neumann, L. Nordheim, and E. P. Wigner, worked on the axiomatic basis of quantum mechanics (see Hilbert space). At the same time, but independently, Dirac formulated quantum mechanics in a way that is close to an axiomatic system, as did Hermann Weyl with the assistance of Erwin Schrödinger.

In the 1930s, probability theory was put on an axiomatic basis by Andrey Kolmogorov, using measure theory.

Since the 1960s, following the work of Arthur Wightman and Rudolf Haag, modern quantum field theory can also be considered close to an axiomatic description.

In the 1990s-2000s the problem of &quot;the limiting processes, there merely indicated, which lead from the atomistic view to the laws of motion of continua&quot; was approached by many groups of mathematicians. Main recent results are summarized by Laure Saint-Raymond, Marshall Slemrod, Alexander N. Gorban and Ilya Karlin.

==Status==
Hilbert’s sixth problem was a proposal to expand the axiomatic method outside the existing mathematical disciplines, to physics and beyond. This expansion requires development of semantics of physics with formal analysis of the notion of physical reality that should be done. Two fundamental theories capture the majority of the fundamental phenomena of physics:
* Quantum field theory, which provides the mathematical framework for the Standard Model;
* General relativity, which describes space-time and gravity at macroscopic scale.
Hilbert considered general relativity as an essential part of the foundation of physics. However, quantum field theory is not logically consistent with general relativity, indicating the need for a still-unknown theory of quantum gravity, where the semantics of physics is expected to play a central role. Hilbert&#x27;s sixth problem thus remains open. Nevertheless, in recent years it has fostered research regarding the foundations of physics with a particular emphasis on the role of logic and precision of language, leading to some interesting results viz. a direct realization of uncertainty principle from Cauchy&#x27;s definition of `derivative&#x27; and the unravelling of a semantic obstacle in the path of any theory of quantum gravity from the axiomatic perspective, unravelling of a logical tautology in the quantum tests of equivalence principle and formal unprovability of the first Maxwell&#x27;s equation.

<text>The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation constitutes a major development in modern physical cosmology. In 1964, US physicist Arno Allan Penzias and radio-astronomer Robert Woodrow Wilson discovered the cosmic microwave background (CMB), estimating its temperature as 3.5 K, as they experimented with the Holmdel Horn Antenna. The new measurements were accepted as important evidence for a hot early Universe (Big Bang theory) and as evidence against the rival steady state theory as theoretical work around 1950 showed the need for a CMB for consistency with the simplest relativistic universe models. In 1978, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for their joint measurement. There had been a prior measurement of the cosmic background radiation (CMB) by Andrew McKellar in 1941 at an effective temperature of 2.3 K using CN stellar absorption lines observed by W. S. Adams. Although no reference to the CMB is made by McKellar, it was not until much later after the Penzias and Wilson measurements that the significance of this measurement was understood.

==History==
By the middle of the 20th century, cosmologists had developed two different theories to explain the creation of the universe. Some supported the steady-state theory, which states that the universe has always existed and will continue to survive without noticeable change. Others believed in the Big Bang theory, which states that the universe was created in a massive explosion-like event billions of years ago (later determined to be approximately 13.8 billion years).

In 1941, Andrew McKellar used W. S. Adams&#x27; spectroscopic observations of CN absorption lines in the spectrum of a B type star to measure a blackbody background temperature of 2.3 K. McKellar referred to his detection as a &quot;&#x27;rotational&#x27; temperature of interstellar molecules&quot;, without reference to a cosmological interpretation, stating that the temperature &quot;will have its own, perhaps limited, significance&quot;.

Over two decades later, working at a Bell Telephone Laboratories facility atop Crawford Hill in Holmdel, New Jersey, in 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were experimenting with a supersensitive, 6 meter (20 ft) horn antenna originally built to detect radio waves bounced off Echo balloon satellites. To measure these faint radio waves, they had to eliminate all recognizable interference from their receiver. They removed the effects of radar and radio broadcasting, and suppressed interference from the heat in the receiver itself by cooling it with liquid helium to −269 °C, only 4 K above absolute zero.

When Penzias and Wilson reduced their data, they found a low, steady, mysterious noise that persisted in their receiver. This residual noise was 100 times more intense than they had expected, was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. They were certain that the radiation they detected on a wavelength of 7.35 centimeters did not come from the Earth, the Sun, or our galaxy. After thoroughly checking their equipment, removing some pigeons nesting in the antenna and cleaning out the accumulated droppings, the noise remained. Both concluded that this noise was coming from outside our own galaxy—although they were not aware of any radio source that would account for it.

At that same time, Robert H. Dicke, Jim Peebles, and David Wilkinson, astrophysicists at Princeton University just away, were preparing to search for microwave radiation in this region of the spectrum. Dicke and his colleagues reasoned that the Big Bang must have scattered not only the matter that condensed into galaxies, but also must have released a tremendous blast of radiation. With the proper instrumentation, this radiation should be detectable, albeit as microwaves, due to a massive redshift.

When his friend Bernard F. Burke, a professor of physics at MIT, told Penzias about a preprint paper he had seen by Jim Peebles on the possibility of finding radiation left over from an explosion that filled the universe at the beginning of its existence, Penzias and Wilson began to realize the significance of what they believed was a new discovery. The characteristics of the radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson fit exactly the radiation predicted by Robert H. Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University. Penzias called Dicke at Princeton, who immediately sent him a copy of the still-unpublished Peebles paper. Penzias read the paper and called Dicke again and invited him to Bell Labs to look at the horn antenna and listen to the background noise. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson and P. G. Roll interpreted this radiation as a signature of the Big Bang.

To avoid potential conflict, they decided to publish their results jointly. Two notes were rushed to the Astrophysical Journal Letters. In the first, Dicke and his associates outlined the importance of cosmic background radiation as substantiation of the Big Bang Theory. In a second note, jointly signed by Penzias and Wilson titled, &quot;A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Megacycles per Second,&quot; they reported the existence of a 3.5 K residual background noise, remaining after accounting for a sky absorption component of 2.3 K and a 0.9 K instrumental component, and attributed a &quot;possible explanation&quot; as that given by Dicke in his companion letter.

In 1978, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for their joint detection. They shared the prize with Pyotr Kapitsa, who won it for unrelated work. In 2019, Jim Peebles was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics, “for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology”.

<text>Desperado is a 1995 American neo-Western action film written, co-produced, edited and directed by Robert Rodriguez. It is the second part of Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Mexico Trilogy&quot;. It stars Antonio Banderas as El Mariachi who seeks revenge on the drug lord who killed his lover. The film was screened out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Desperado&quot; grossed $58 million worldwide. It has been cited as featuring Salma Hayek&#x27;s breakout role.

==Plot==
At the Tarasco bar in Mexico, an American man named Buscemi tells the story of witnessing a massacre in another bar, committed by a Mexican who had a guitar case full of guns. The bar&#x27;s patrons are uninterested until Buscemi mentions the name &quot;Bucho&quot;. Meanwhile, El Mariachi has a dream of his encounter with Moco, Bucho&#x27;s underling, who killed his lover and shot his left hand, but Buscemi awakens him and tells him to continue searching for Bucho.

El Mariachi meets a child, whose father allegedly plays guitar for a living. Having been a guitarist himself, he gives the boy some guitar lessons. At the Tarasco bar, El Mariachi engages in a tense standoff with Bucho&#x27;s henchmen, followed by a massive gunfight. El Mariachi kills everyone in the bar but Tavo, who was in a back room conducting illegal business. Tavo survives and follows El Mariachi outside and wounds him, but is killed by El Mariachi. Carolina, a woman whom El Mariachi shielded from Tavo&#x27;s bullets, takes him to her bookstore. Bucho arrives at the bar to survey the carnage. Threatened by the situation, Bucho orders his men to hunt down the man &quot;dressed in black&quot;.

At her bookstore, Carolina tends to El Mariachi&#x27;s wounds. While he rests, she discovers the guns in his guitar case and deduces his identity, based on Buscemi&#x27;s story. El Mariachi asks her to help him locate Bucho. He goes to the town church and talks to Buscemi. Upset by the massacre at the bar, Buscemi convinces El Mariachi to abandon his quest for revenge. Outside the church, they are ambushed by a man armed with throwing knives, who kills Buscemi and severely wounds El Mariachi. Bucho&#x27;s men arrive at the scene, and mistake the man (who dresses in black) for El Mariachi and kill him. They take the body back to Bucho, but suddenly realizes they have killed the wrong person: a hitman named Navajas sent by the Colombians to kill El Mariachi.

As an injured El Mariachi wanders the streets, he meets the kid with the guitar once again. He learns that the kid is being used by his father to mule drugs hidden in his guitar. He angrily confronts the boy, who tells him most people in the town work for Bucho. El Mariachi returns to Carolina and learns that Bucho financed her bookstore as an additional front for his drug dealing. Bucho arrives, unexpectedly, and she hastily hides El Mariachi. She feigns ignorance of the commotion in town, and Bucho leaves. Carolina completes the suturing of El Mariachi&#x27;s wounds. That evening, she gives El Mariachi a new guitar, which he plays for her before they make passionate love. Meanwhile, Bucho realizes that Carolina lied to him.

The next morning, Bucho&#x27;s men arrive and attack El Mariachi and Carolina and set her bookstore ablaze. The two fight their way out of the burning building and onto a local rooftop, where El Mariachi gets a clear shot at Bucho but inexplicably chooses not to attempt to kill him. The two hide in a hotel room.

Angry about their failure to kill El Mariachi, Bucho gathers his men and says: &quot;You drive around town, you see someone you don&#x27;t know, you shoot them! How hard is that, huh?!&quot;. He shoots one man and then fires at the others, as an example.

Realizing that Bucho will never stop hunting him, El Mariachi contacts his friends, Campa and Quino, for assistance. The trio meets up on the edge of town and encounters Bucho&#x27;s henchmen. A massive gun showdown ensues, and most of Bucho&#x27;s men, along with Campa and Quino, are killed. El Mariachi discovers that the guitar-playing boy has been wounded during the showdown and rushes him to a hospital.

El Mariachi and Carolina travel to Bucho&#x27;s compound intending to confront him. It is then revealed that Bucho is El Mariachi&#x27;s older brother, Cesar. El Mariachi was unaware of &quot;Bucho&#x27;s&quot; identity, until he saw his brother&#x27;s face, from the rooftop, and refrained from shooting him. Bucho offers to release El Mariachi if he allows Bucho to kill Carolina. El Mariachi kills his brother, then shoots the remaining henchmen. The two visit the boy in the hospital, and El Mariachi leaves alone. Carolina catches up to him on the road and picks him up, with El Mariachi initially leaving his weapons on the side of the road. The two drive away together, but shortly return and pick up the guitar case, full of guns, just to be safe.

==Cast==
==Production==
Rodriguez&#x27;s friend Quentin Tarantino has a cameo as &quot;Pick-up Guy&quot;. Carlos Gallardo, who played the title role of &quot;El Mariachi&quot;, appears in &quot;Desperado&quot; as Campa, a friend of Banderas&#x27; Mariachi. Since Banderas replaced Gallardo as the actor for the main character, the filmmakers re-shot the final showdown from &quot;El Mariachi&quot; as a flashback sequence for Banderas&#x27; character in &quot;Desperado&quot;.

Raúl Juliá was originally cast as Bucho, but died on October 24, 1994, before production began.

Principal photography took place entirely in Ciudad Acuña, Mexico, across from Del Rio, Texas.

During the filming of the sex scene, Salma Hayek became uncomfortable and started crying. Hayek has stated that Rodriguez and Banderas “were amazing” and that Rodriguez “never put pressure on me.”

===Rating===
After it was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, the film was granted an NC-17 due to graphic violence and it had to be severely cut for an R rating. Among the scenes that were trimmed are the deaths of Tarantino&#x27;s character and his friend at the bar, as well as Trejo&#x27;s character. By far the most major excision came at the end of the film, which originally contained a large-scale shootout between El Mariachi, Carolina, Bucho, and his thugs at Bucho&#x27;s mansion. Owing to the amount of footage the MPAA demanded be removed from the scene, Rodriguez elected to remove the sequence in its entirety, giving the film its current fade-out ending. Two additional scenes were also deleted featuring the codpiece gun (seen in the guitar case). Originally, the gun was used by El Mariachi during the second bar shootout when he uses it to shoot the first thug before whipping out his pistols from his sleeves and finishing him off. In a second deleted scene, the crotch gun was to go off accidentally while Banderas is in bed with Hayek, blowing a hole through the guitar while they were playing it. The gun was eventually used in unrelated Rodriguez&#x27;s films &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; and &quot;Machete Kills&quot;.

===Music===

The film&#x27;s score is written and performed by the Los Angeles rock band Los Lobos, performing Chicano rock and traditional ranchera music. Their performance of &quot;Mariachi Suite&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance at the 1995 Grammy Awards. Other artists on the soundtrack album include Dire Straits, Link Wray, Latin Playboys, and Carlos Santana. Musician Tito Larriva has a small role in the film, and his band, Tito &amp; Tarantula, contributed to the soundtrack as well.

American figure skater Nathan Chen used “Canción del Mariachi” as the music for his 2020-21 skating season short program, skating in a costume that closely resembled Banderas’ black pants and white shirt in the film.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 70% based on reviews from 54 critics, with an average rating of 6.5/10, The sites consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Desperado&quot; contains almost too much action and too little of a story to sustain interest, but Antonio Banderas proves a charismatic lead in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s inventive extravaganza.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 55 out of 100, based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;could scarcely be more dazzling on a purely visual level, but it&#x27;s mortally anemic in the story, character and thematic departments.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the film &quot;B&quot; and praised the action sequences despite the lack of characterization. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Overdependence on violence also marginalizes &quot;Desperado&quot; as a gun-slinging novelty item, instead of the broader effort toward which this talented young director might have aspired.&quot;

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated it 2 out of 4 stars and wrote, &quot;What happens looks terrific. Now if he can harness that technical facility to a screenplay that&#x27;s more story than setup, he might really have something.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;the commercial transition has been remarkably successful. This is primarily thanks to Rodriguez, who not only retains the original movie&#x27;s kinetic flair, but takes it further.&quot; Bob McCabe of &quot;Empire&quot; rated it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s big, it&#x27;s daft, but &quot;Desperado&quot; is confident and hugely entertaining filmmaking.&quot; Heidi Strom of the &quot;Daily Press&quot; wrote, &quot;A pure adrenaline rush from start to finish, &quot;Desperado&quot; will shock, amuse, thrill and disgust – but never disappoint.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $25.4 million in the United States and Canada and $58 million worldwide.

<text>Night writing is the name given to a form of tactile writing invented by Charles Barbier de la Serre (1767–1841). It is one of a dozen forms of alternative writing presented in a book published in 1815: &quot;Essai sur divers procédés d&#x27;expéditive française, contenant douze écritures différentes, avec une planche pour chaque procédé&quot; (Essay on various processes of French expedition, containing twelve different writings, with a plate for each process). The term (in French: &quot;écriture nocturne&quot;) does not appear in the book, but was later applied to the method shown on Plate VII of that book. This method of writing with raised dots that could be read by touch was adopted at the Institution Royale des Jeunes Aveugles (Royal Institution for Blind Youth) in Paris. 

A student at the school, Louis Braille, used the tools and Barbier&#x27;s idea of communicating with raised dots in a form of code, and developed a more compact and flexible system for communications, Braille.

== Origin ==
In 1815, Charles Barbier developed a type of relief writing. This process would be called &quot;night writing&quot;.

== Function ==
The principle of night writing is to transcribe using 36 distinct phonetic sounds, each represented by a raised pattern of dots in a 2 × 6 grid.

The 36 sounds are represented in a 6 × 6 table; the 2 × 6 grid of dots designates the coordinates of the desired sound. For example, the sound placed in the first line and the third column of the table is represented by (1, 3). This, in turn, is written with 1 dot in the first column, and 3 dots in the second.

The phoneme &quot;t&quot; is represented thus:

Charles Barbier also invented the tools to facilitate this form of writing with raised dots: a shelf ruler that had groups of 6 horizontal grooves. To transcribe their message, the writer uses a punch to pierce the paper, guided by the grooves of the ruler. A movable cursor helps guide the punch. The relief writing appears on the back of the paper; the writing is therefore reversed, hence one must write from right to left. By running their fingers across the front, the recipient of the message counts the number of dots in each row and deduces the nature of the corresponding sound.

This was an extraordinary advancement in its time. Previously, the only writing accessible to the blind was one developed by Valentin Haüy, the founder of the Royal Institution for Blind Youth. His system impressed the shapes of typographic characters onto wet paper. However, as the embossed letters had to each be distinct, books using the system were cumbersome and of limited length. Furthermore, students had no means to reproduce the method so as to write themselves.

Barbier&#x27;s night writing also faced several limitations and imperfections:

* no combinations of dots existed to represent punctuation marks, numbers, musical notes, mathematical symbols, etc.
* the height of the grid (2 × 6 points) made it impossible to read in a single go with one finger
* potential information is wasted: a grid of 12 points would theoretically allow up to 212 (or 4096) symbols to be represented, when Barbier presented only 36 symbols.

== Influence on Braille ==
In 1815, Barbier published a pamphlet titled &quot;Essai sur divers procédés d&#x27;expéditive française, contenant douze écritures différentes, avec une planche pour chaque procédé&quot; (Essay on various processes of French expedition, containing twelve different writings, with a plate for each process). The aim was to present how relief writing, recognisable by touch, could aid the blind.

In 1823, Barbier received a bronze medal at Versailles&#x27; industrial exposition for having invented this new form of writing which could be read without seeing. Under the administration of Count Alexis de Noailles, his method was adopted by the Royal Institution for Blind Youth.

In 1829, Louis Braille published &quot;Procédé pour écrire les paroles, la musique et le plain-chant au moyen de points, à l’usage des aveugles et disposés pour eux&quot; (Process for writing words, music and lyrics by way of dots, for the use of, and arranged for, the blind). This was based on Barbier&#x27;s invention but greatly improved its legibility, and the publication marked the official birth of the Braille alphabet. Louis Braille revised the publication in 1837, and this second edition contained the system now known by the name Braille.

In 1832, Barbier published a new pamphlet, &quot;Émancipation intellectuelle d’expéditive française&quot;, which stresses that his writing system, though designed for the blind, could also be of use in the army and in hospitals.

<text>Bruno Bettelheim (August 28, 1903 – March 13, 1990) was an Austrian-born psychologist, scholar, public intellectual and writer who spent most of his academic and clinical career in the United States. An early writer on autism, Bettelheim&#x27;s work focused on the education of emotionally disturbed children, as well as Freudian psychology more generally. In the U.S., he later gained a position as professor at the University of Chicago and director of the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School for Disturbed Children, and after 1973 taught at Stanford University.

Bettelheim&#x27;s ideas, which grew out of those of Sigmund Freud, theorized that children with behavioral and emotional disorders were not born that way, and could be treated through extended psychoanalytic therapy, treatment that rejected the use of psychotropic drugs and shock therapy. During the 1960s and 1970s he had an international reputation in such fields as autism, child psychiatry, and psychoanalysis.

Some of his work was discredited after his death due to fraudulent academic credentials, allegations of patient abuse, accusations of plagiarism, and lack of oversight by institutions and the psychological community.

==Background in Austria==
Bruno Bettelheim was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, on August 28, 1903. When his father died, Bettelheim left his studies at the University of Vienna to look after his family&#x27;s sawmill. Having discharged his obligations to his family&#x27;s business, Bettelheim returned as a mature student in his thirties to the University of Vienna. Sources disagree about his education (see Misrepresented credentials section).

Bettelheim&#x27;s first wife, Gina, took care of a troubled American child, Patsy, who lived in their home in Vienna for seven years, and who may have been on the autism spectrum.

In the Austrian academic culture of Bettelheim&#x27;s time, one could not study the history of art without mastering aspects of psychology. Candidates for the doctoral dissertation in the History of Art in 1938 at Vienna University had to fulfill prerequisites in the formal study of the role of Jungian archetypes in art, and in art as an expression of the unconscious.
Though Jewish by birth, Bettelheim grew up in a secular family. After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; (political annexation) of Austria on March 13, 1938, the National Socialist (Nazi) authorities sent Austrian Jews and political opponents to the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps where many were brutally treated, and tortured or killed. Bettelheim was arrested some two months later on May 28, 1938, and was imprisoned in both these camps for ten and half months before being released on April 14, 1939. While at the Buchenwald camp, he met and befriended the social psychologist Ernst Federn. As a result of an amnesty declared for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday (which occurred slightly later on April 20, 1939), Bettelheim and hundreds of other prisoners were released. Bettelheim drew on the experience of the concentration camps for some of his later work.

==Life and career in the United States==
Bettelheim arrived by ship as a refugee in New York City in late 1939 to join his wife Gina, who had already emigrated. They divorced because she had become involved with someone else during their separation. He soon moved to Chicago, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1944, and married an Austrian woman, Gertrude (&#x27;Trudi&#x27;) Weinfeld, also an emigrant from Vienna.

===Psychology===
The Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a wartime project to help resettle European scholars by circulating their resumes to American universities. Through this process, Ralph Tyler hired Bettelheim to be his research assistant at the University of Chicago from 1939 to 1941 with funding from the Progressive Education Association to evaluate how high schools taught art. Once this funding ran out, Bettelheim found a job at Rockford College, Illinois, where he taught from 1942 to 1944.

In 1943, he published the paper &quot;Individual and Mass Behavior in Extreme Situations&quot; about his experiences in the concentration camps, a paper which was highly regarded by Dwight Eisenhower among others. Bettelheim claimed he had interviewed 1,500 fellow prisoners, although this was unlikely. He stated that the Viennese psychoanalyst Richard Sterba had analyzed him, as well as implying in several of his writings that he had written a PhD dissertation in the philosophy of education. His actual PhD was in art history, and he had only taken three introductory courses in psychology.

Through Ralph Tyler&#x27;s recommendation, the University of Chicago appointed Bettelheim as a professor of psychology, as well as director of the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School for emotionally disturbed children. He held both positions from 1944 until his retirement in 1973. He wrote a number of books on psychology and, for a time, had an international reputation for his work on Sigmund Freud, psychoanalysis, and emotionally disturbed children.

At the Orthogenic School, Bettelheim made changes and set up an environment for milieu therapy, in which children could form strong attachments with adults within a structured but caring environment. He claimed considerable success in treating some of the emotionally disturbed children. He wrote books on both normal and abnormal child psychology, and became a major influence in the field, widely respected during his lifetime. He was noted for his study of feral children, who revert to the animal stage without experiencing the benefits of belonging to a community. He discussed this phenomenon in the book &quot;The Informed Heart&quot;. Even critics agree that, in his practice, Bettelheim was dedicated to helping these children using methods and practices that would enable them to lead happy lives. It is based on his position that psychotherapy could change humans and that they can adapt to their environment provided they are given proper care and attention.

Bettelheim was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. After retiring in 1973, he and his wife moved to Portola Valley, California, where he continued to write and taught at Stanford University. His wife died in 1984.

===&quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot;===
Bettelheim analyzed fairy tales in terms of Freudian psychology in &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot; (1976). He discussed the emotional and symbolic importance of fairy tales for children, including traditional tales once considered too dark, such as those collected and published by the Brothers Grimm. Bettelheim suggested that traditional fairy tales, with the darkness of abandonment, death, witches, and injuries, allowed children to grapple with their fears in remote, symbolic terms. If they could read and interpret these fairy tales in their own way, he believed, they would get a greater sense of meaning and purpose. Bettelheim thought that by engaging with these socially evolved stories, children would go through emotional growth that would better prepare them for their own futures. In the United States, Bettelheim won two major awards for &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot;: the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism
and the National Book Award in the category of Contemporary Thought.

However, in 1991, well-supported charges of plagiarism were brought against Bettelheim&#x27;s &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot;, primarily that he had copied from Julian Herscher&#x27;s 1963 &quot;A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales&quot; (revised ed. 1974).

===Death===
At the end of his life, Bettelheim had depression. He appeared to have had difficulties with depression for much of his life. In 1990, widowed, in failing physical health, and experiencing the effects of a stroke which impaired his mental abilities and paralyzed part of his body, he took his own life. He died on March 13, 1990, in Maryland.

==In popular culture==
Bettelheim was a public intellectual, whose writing and many public appearances in popular media paralleled a growing post WWII interest in psychoanalysis. For instance, he appeared multiple times on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in the 70s to discuss theories of autism and psychoanalysis. Richard Pollak&#x27;s biography of Bettelheim argues that such popular appearances shielded his unethical behavior from scrutiny.

Bettelheim appeared as himself in the 1983 Woody Allen mockumentary Zelig.

A BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; documentary about Bettelheim was televised in 1987.
==Controversies and scientific fraud accusations==
Bettelheim&#x27;s life and work have come under increasing scrutiny since his death, notably in a biography by Richard Pollak (1997).

===Misrepresented credentials===
Though he spent most of his life working in psychology and psychiatry, Bettelheim&#x27;s educational background in those fields is murky at best. Sources disagree whether Bettelheim&#x27;s PhD was in art history or in philosophy (aesthetics). When he was hired at the University of Chicago, Ralph W. Tyler assumed that he had two PhDs, one in art history and the other in psychology. He also believed, falsely, that Bettelheim was certified to conduct psychoanalysis though Bettelheim never received such certification. A posthumous review of his transcript showed that Bettelheim had only taken three introductory classes in psychology. Bertram Cohler and Jacquelyn Sanders at the Orthogenic School believed Bettelheim had a PhD in art history. In some of his own writings, Bettelheim implied that he had written a dissertation on the philosophy of education.

Determining Bettelheim&#x27;s education is complicated by the fact that he routinely embellished or inflated aspects of his own biography. As an example, Bettelheim&#x27;s first wife, Gina, took care of a troubled American child, Patsy, who lived in their home in Vienna for seven years. Although Bettelheim later claimed he himself had taken care of the child, there is general agreement that his wife actually provided most of the child care. However sources disagree on whether Patsy was autistic. Bettelheim later claimed that it was Patsy who inspired him to study autism and embellished her into two or even several autistic children in his home.

Additionally, when he applied for a position at Rockford College in Illinois, he claimed in a résumé that he had earned &quot;&quot; doctorates in philosophy, art history, and psychology, and he made claims that he had run the art department at Lower Austria&#x27;s library, that he had published two books on art, that he had excavated Roman antiquities, and that he had engaged in music studies with Arnold Schoenberg. When he applied at the University of Chicago for a professorship and as director of the Orthogenic School, he further claimed that he had training in psychology, experience raising autistic children, and personal encouragement from Sigmund Freud. The University of Chicago biographical sketch of Bettelheim listed a single PhD but no subject area. Posthumous biographies of Bettelheim have investigated these claims and have come to no clear conclusions about his credentials. A review in &quot;The Independent&quot; (UK) of Sutton&#x27;s book stated that Bettelheim &quot;despite claims to the contrary, possessed no psychology qualifications of any sort&quot;. Another review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by a different reviewer stated that Bettelheim &quot;began inventing degrees he never earned&quot;. A review in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated &quot;as Pollak demonstrates, Bettelheim was a snake-oil salesman of the first magnitude.&quot;

In a 1997 &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; article Peter Kramer, clinical professor of psychiatry at Brown University, summarized: &quot;There were snatches of truth in the tall tale, but not many. Bettelheim had earned a non-honors degree in philosophy, he had made acquaintances in the psychoanalytic community, and his first wife had helped raise a troubled child. But, from 1926 to 1938, the bulk of the &#x27;14 years&#x27; at universityBettelheim had worked as a lumber dealer in the family business.&quot;

In his 1997 review of Pollak&#x27;s book in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, Paul R. McHugh, then director of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins, stated &quot;Bettelheimwith boldness, energy and luckexploited American deference to Freudo-Nietzschean mind-sets and interpretation, especially when intoned in accents Viennese.&quot;

==== Richard Pollak&#x27;s 1997 biography of Bettelheim ====
In the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, Robert Gottlieb describes Pollak as a &quot;relentlessly negative biographer&quot;, but Gottlieb still writes: &quot;The accusations against Bettelheim fall into several categories. First, he lied; that is, he both exaggerated his successes at the school and falsified aspects of his background, claiming a more elaborate academic and psychoanalytic history in Vienna than he had actually had. There is conclusive evidence to support both charges.&quot; Gottlieb goes on to say that Bettelheim arrived in the United States as a Holocaust survivor and refugee without a job nor even a profession, and writes: &quot;I suspect he said what he thought it was necessary to say, and was then stuck with these claims later on, when he could neither confirm them (since they were false) nor, given his pride, acknowledge that he had lied.&quot;

Richard Pollak&#x27;s biography begins with a personal account, for his brother died in an accident while home from Bettelheim&#x27;s school on holiday. While playing hide-and-go-seek in a hay loft, the brother fell through a chute covered with hay and hit the concrete floor on the level below. Years later, Pollak hoped to get some information about his brother&#x27;s life and sought out Bettelheim. As Pollak recounts, &quot;Bettelheim immediately launched into an attack. The boys&#x27; father, he said, was a simple-minded &#x27;schlemiel.&#x27; Their mother, he insisted, had rejected Stephen at birth forcing him to develop &#x27;pseudo-feeble-mindedness&#x27; to cope.&quot; He went on to angrily ask: &quot;What is it about these Jewish mothers, Mr. Pollak?&quot; Bettelheim furthermore insisted the brother had committed suicide and made it look like an accident. Pollak did not believe this.

As a review in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; states, &quot;The stance of infallibility over matters Pollak knew to be untrue prompted him to wonder about the foundation of Bettelheim&#x27;s commanding reputation.&quot;

In a 1997 book review in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Sarah Boxer wrote (regarding the plagiarism allegations): &quot;Mr. Pollak gives a damning passage-for-passage comparison of the two [Bettelheim&#x27;s book and Heuscher&#x27;s earlier book].&quot;

Richard Pollak&#x27;s biography, &quot;The Creation of Dr. B&quot;, portrays Bettelheim as an anti-Semite even though he was raised in a secular Jewish household, and asserts that Bettelheim criticized in others the same cowardice he himself had displayed in the concentration camps.

Pollak&#x27;s biography also states that two women reported that Bettelheim had fondled their breasts and those of other female students at the school while he was ostensibly apologizing to each for beating her.

A number of reviewers criticized Pollak&#x27;s writing style, commenting that his book was motivated by &quot;Vengeance, not malice&quot; or that his book was &quot;curiously unnuanced&quot;, but they still largely agreed with his conclusions.

===Plagiarism in Bettelheim&#x27;s &quot;Uses of Enchantment&quot;===
In 1991, Alan Dundes published an article in the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot; in which he claimed Bettelheim had engaged in plagiarism in his 1976 &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot;. He argued that Bettelheim had copied from a variety of sources, including Dundes&#x27; own 1967 paper on Cinderella, but most of all from Julius E. Heuscher&#x27;s 1963 book &quot;A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales&quot; (revised edition 1974).

On the other hand, Jacquelyn Sanders, who worked with Bettelheim and later became director of the Orthogenic School, stated that she had read Dundes&#x27; article but disagreed with its conclusions: &quot;I would not call that plagiarism. I think the article is a reasonable scholarly endeavor, and calling it scholarly etiquette is appropriate. It is appropriate that this man deserved to be acknowledged and Bettelheim didn&#x27;t… But I would not fail a student for doing that, and I don&#x27;t know anybody who would&quot;.

===Abusive treatment of students===
Many students and staff at the school have argued that Bettelheim was abusive, violent, and cruel to them and to others. There are multiple newspaper accounts of abuse, in letters, editorials, articles, and memoirs. A November 1990 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article states: &quot;Of the 19 alumni of the Orthogenic School interviewed for this story, some are still bitterly angry at Bettelheim, 20 or 30 years after leaving the institution due to the trauma they had suffered under him. Others say their stays did them good, and they express gratitude for having had the opportunity to be at the school. All agree that Bettelheim frequently struck his young and vulnerable patients.&quot;

A particularly evocative example came from Alida Jatich, who lived at the school from 1966 to 1972 from ages twelve to eighteen. She wrote an initially anonymous April 1990 letter to the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; in which she stated that she &quot;lived in fear of Bettelheim&#x27;s unpredictable temper tantrums, public beatings, hair pulling, wild accusations and threats and abuse in front of classmates and staff. One minute he could be smiling and joking, the next minute he could be exploding.&quot; She added, &quot;In person, he was an evil man who set up his school as a private empire and himself as a demi-god or cultleader.&quot; Jatich said Bettelheim had &quot;bullied, awed, and terrorized&quot; the children at his school, their parents, school staff members, his graduate students, and anyone else who came into contact with him.

Jacquelyn Sanders, who later became director of the Orthogenic School, said she thought it was a case of Bettelheim getting too much success too quickly. &quot;Dr. B got worse once he started getting acclaim&quot;, she said. &quot;He was less able to have any insight into his effect on these kids.&quot;

Conversely, some staff who worked at the Orthogenic School have stated that they saw Bettelheim&#x27;s behavior as being corporal punishment, in line with the standards of the time, and not abuse. As an example, David Zwerdling, who was a counselor at the school for one year in 1969–70, wrote a Sept. 1990 response to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which he stated, &quot;I witnessed one occasion when an adolescent boy cursed at a female counselor. Incensed upon learning of this, Dr. Bettelheim proceeded to slap the boy two or three times across the face, while telling him sternly never to speak that way to a woman again. This was the only such incident I observed or heard of during my year at the school… until fairly recently, the near-consensus against corporal punishment in schools did not obtain.&quot; However, Zwerdling also noted, &quot;He also was a man who, for whatever reasons, was capable of intense anger on occasion.&quot;

Published books, memoirs, and biographies of Bettelheim have also taken up the question of his treatment of students.

====Institutional and professional non-responses====
Perhaps in part because of Bettelheim&#x27;s professional and public stature, there was little effort during his lifetime to curtail his behavior or intervene on behalf of his victims. His work at the University of Chicago seems to have been given less formal oversight by the university than other research entities under their purview.

A &quot;Newsweek&quot; article reported that Chicago-area psychiatrists had privately given him the nickname &quot;Brutalheim&quot;, but did nothing to intervene effectively on behalf of students at the school.

Professionals in the psychiatric and psychological communities likely knew there were allegations of abuse and maltreatment at the Orthogenic School. Howard Gardner, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote that many professionals knew of Bettelheim&#x27;s behavior but did not confront him for various reasons ranging from &quot;fear about Bettelheim&#x27;s legendary capacity for retribution to the solidarity needed among the guild of healers to a feeling that, on balance, Bettelheim&#x27;s positive attributes predominated and an unmasking would fuel more malevolent forces.&quot;

===Autism controversy===

Behavioral psychology and conditions in children and adolescents was little understood in the mid-twentieth century. The concept of &quot;autism&quot; was first used as a term for schizophrenia. In the 1950s into the 1960s what may be understood as autism in children was regularly also referred to as &quot;childhood psychosis and childhood schizophrenia&quot;. &quot;Psychogenesis&quot;, the theory that childhood disorders had origins in early childhood events or trauma acting on the child from the outside was a prominent theory, and Bettelheim was a prominent proponent of a psychogenic basis for autism. For Bettelheim, the idea that outside forces cause individual behavior issues can be traced back to his earliest prominent article on the psychology of imprisoned persons. Beginning in the 1960s and into the 1970s, &quot;biogenesis&quot;, the idea that such conditions had an inner-organic or biological basis overtook psychogenesis.

Currently, many of Bettelheim&#x27;s theories in which he attributes autism spectrum conditions to parenting style are considered to be discredited, aside from the controversies relating to his academic and professional qualifications.

Autism spectrum conditions are currently regarded as perhaps having multiple forms with a variety of genetic, epigenetic, and brain development causes influenced by such environmental factors as complications during pregnancy, viral infections, and perhaps even air pollution.

The two biographies by Sutton (1995) and Pollak (1997) awakened interest and focus on Bettelheim&#x27;s actual methods as distinct from his public persona. Bettelheim&#x27;s theories on the causes of autism have been largely discredited, and his reporting rates of cure have been questioned, with critics stating that his patients were not actually autistic. In a favorable review of Pollak&#x27;s biography, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;What scanty evidence remains suggests that his patients were not even autistic in the first place.&quot;

In 1997 the psychiatrist Peter Kramer wrote, &quot;The Ford Foundation was willing to underwrite innovative treatments for autistic children, so Bettelheim labeled his children autistic. Few actually met the definition of the newly minted syndrome.&quot;

Bettelheim believed that autism did not have an organic basis, but resulted when mothers withheld appropriate affection from their children and failed to make a good connection with them. Bettelheim also blamed absent or weak fathers. One of his most famous books, &quot;The Empty Fortress&quot; (1967), contains a complex and detailed explanation of this dynamic in psychoanalytical and psychological terms. These views were disputed at the time by mothers of autistic children and by researchers. He derived his thinking from the qualitative investigation of clinical cases. He also related the world of autistic children to conditions in concentration camps.

It appears that Leo Kanner first came up with the term &quot;refrigerator mother&quot;, although Bettelheim did a lot to popularize the term. &quot;Although it now seems beyond comprehension that anyone would believe that autism is caused by deep-seated issues arising in early childhood relationships, virtually every psychiatric condition was attributed to parent-child relationships in the 1940s and 1950s, when Freudian psychoanalytic theory was in its heyday.&quot;

In &quot;A Good Enough Parent&quot;, published in 1987, he had come to the view that children had considerable resilience and that most parents could be &quot;good enough&quot; to help their children make a good start.

Prior to this, Bettelheim subscribed to and became an early prominent proponent of the &quot;refrigerator mother&quot; theory of autism: the theory that autistic behaviors stem from the emotional frigidity of the children&#x27;s mothers. He adapted and transformed the Orthogenic School at the University of Chicago as a residential treatment milieu for such children, who he felt would benefit from a &quot;parentectomy&quot;. This marked the apex of autism viewed as a disorder of parenting.

A 2002 book on autism spectrum stated, &quot;At the time, few people knew that Bettelheim had faked his credentials and was using fictional data to support his research.&quot; Michael Rutter has observed, &quot;Many people made a mistake in going from a statement which is undoubtedly true—that there is no evidence that autism has been caused by poor parenting—to the statement that it has been disproven. It has not actually been disproven. It has faded away simply because, on the one hand, of a lack of convincing evidence and on the other hand, an awareness that autism was a neurodevelopmental disorder of some kind.&quot;

In a 1997 review of two books on Bettelheim, Molly Finn wrote &quot;I am the mother of an autistic daughter, and have considered Bettelheim a charlatan since &quot;The Empty Fortress&quot;, his celebrated study of autism, came out in 1967. I have nothing personal against Bettelheim, if it is not personal to resent being compared to a devouring witch, an infanticidal king, and an SS guard in a concentration camp, or to wonder what could be the basis of Bettelheim&#x27;s statement that &#x27;the precipitating factor in infantile autism is the parent&#x27;s wish that his child should not exist.&#x27;&quot;

Although Bettelheim foreshadowed the modern interest in the causal influence of genetics in the section &quot;Parental Background,&quot; he consistently emphasised nurture over nature. For example: &quot;When at last the once totally frozen affects begin to emerge, and a much richer human personality to evolve, then convictions about the psychogenic nature of the disturbance become stronger still.&quot;; &quot;On Treatability,&quot; p. 412. The rates of recovery claimed for the Orthogenic School are set out in &quot;Follow-up Data,&quot; with a recovery good enough to be considered a &#x27;cure&#x27; of 43%, pp. 414–15.

Subsequently, medical research has provided greater understanding of the biological basis of autism and other illnesses. Scientists such as Bernard Rimland challenged Bettelheim&#x27;s view of autism by arguing that autism is a neurodevelopmental issue. As late as 2009, the &quot;refrigerator mother&quot; theory retained some prominent supporters, including the prominent Irish psychologist Tony Humphreys. His theory still enjoys widespread support in France.

In his book &quot;Unstrange Minds&quot; (2007), Roy Richard Grinker wrote:
Jordynn Jack writes that Bettelheim&#x27;s ideas gained currency and became popular in large part because society already tended to blame a mother first and foremost for her child&#x27;s difficulties.

===Remarks about Jews and the Holocaust===
Bettelheim&#x27;s experiences during the Holocaust shaped his personal and professional life for years after. His first publication was &quot;Individual and Mass Behavior in Extreme Situations&quot; derived from his experiences at Dachau and Buchenwald. His later work frequently compared emotionally disturbed childhood to prison or confinement, and according to Sutton, his professional work attempted to operationalize the lessons about human nature he learned during his confinement.

Bettelheim became one of the most prominent defenders of Hannah Arendt&#x27;s book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;. He wrote a positive review for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. This review prompted a letter from a writer, Harry Golden, who alleged that both Bettelheim and Arendt suffered from &quot;an essentially Jewish phenomenon… self-hatred&quot;.

Bettelheim would later speak critically of Jewish people who were killed during the Holocaust. He has been criticized for promoting the myth that Jews went &quot;like sheep to the slaughter&quot; and for blaming Anne Frank and her family for their own deaths due to not owning firearms, fleeing, or hiding more effectively. In an introduction he wrote to an account by Miklos Nyiszli, Bettelheim stated, discussing Frank, that &quot;Everybody who recognized the obvious knew that the hardest way to go underground was to do it as a family; that to hide as a family made detection by the SS most likely. The Franks, with their excellent connections among gentile Dutch families should have had an easy time hiding out singly, each with a different family. But instead of planning for this, the main principle of their planning was to continue as much as possible with the kind of family life they were accustomed to.&quot;

<text>Elín Ortiz (December 14, 1934 – June 12, 2016) was a Puerto Rican actor, comedian and producer. He died on June 12, 2016, primarily due to Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.

==Early years==
Elín Ortiz graduated from Ponce High School at the age of 16.

==Career==
Ortiz began his career as a radio and stage actor while still studying at the Universidad de Puerto Rico, sharing credits with Luis Antonio Rivera (Yoyo Boing), Walter Mercado, Adela Villamil, Jacobo Morales and many others. Since the beginning of TV in 1954 he participated in local soap operas (telenovelas), comedy programs and televised stage plays, as well as cultural programming on WIPR, the government-operated radio and television stations, where he also worked as writer and director.

On stage, Ortiz was considered among the most versatile actors of his generation, due to his talent for both, drama and comedy. With Morales, Myrna Vázquez, Marcos Betancourt and Alicia Moreda, Ortiz was a founder of El Cemi Theater Company.

In the 1960s Ortiz was a star in many of the programs produced for Telemundo by Paquito Cordero on a weekly basis, especially &#x27;La Taberna India&#x27;, in which he played Reliquia, an ancient (although Ortiz was in his 20s) small-town smart aleck lawyer who victimized the everyday countryman (jibaro) played by Adalberto Rodriguez (Machuchal) through money-making schemes created by Reliquia&#x27;s corrupt mind. The show was a very popular one for more than a decade.

In the early 1970s, Ortiz started the production of his own TV shows at Telemundo, among them the first Astrology-related program starring Walter Mercado and segments designed to showcase the talents of dancing/singing bombshell Iris Chacon, who later became his second wife. Years later, after marrying Charytin Goyco, he produced and co-starred with her in &#x27;Mi Dulce Charytin&#x27; a weekly long running variety show which combined music and comedy, produced at WAPA-TV. Ortiz was always the writer, director and visionary mastermind of his productions.date=July 2020

One of Ortiz&#x27;s works, &quot;Las Rosas Blancas&quot;, a made-for-TV film fantasy/drama musical, starring Charytin, Luis Antonio Cosme, Miguel Angel Alvarez and Ortiz himself, received the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award in 1975, after being selected along with 26 other radio and/or TV productions from more than 1,000 entries.date=July 2020

In 1985, he returned to WAPA-TV as a comedian in a show sponsored by Budweiser, known as &quot;La Taverna Budweiser&quot;, alongside Machuchal, reprising the same type of program they made two decades before in Telemundo. During that time Ortiz developed programs of political satire such as &quot;Qué Pueblito&quot;, &quot;El Pueblito Nius&quot;, &quot;Ay Bendito, que Pueblito !&quot; and &quot;El Pueblito Contra Ataca&quot; in which he played another old man character, Cheito Boogaloo, who denounced corruption while making fun of political matters. He also produced the very popular &quot;Barrio 4 Calles&quot; starring Leopoldo &#x27;Pucho&#x27; Fernandez and Miguel Angel Alvarez, as well as the children&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Que Angelitos&quot;, starring his son Shalim.

==Personal life==
Ortiz&#x27;s first marriage was to Rosalinda Alonso, a lady not related to the artistic world with whom he had two daughters. Unfortunately, while Alonso was pregnant with their second daughter, Ortiz contracted measles which in turn he gave to his wife and unborn child. His second daughter lived to her teens. His first daughter died in her 20s due to complications following treatment for lupus. Following a divorce he was briefly married to dancer/singer Iris Chacón during the early 1970s. In 1978, he married singer/composer Charytín, a Dominican Republic native who had lived in Puerto Rico for many years. In 1979, they had their first son, Shalim. They relocated in Miami, Florida during the late 1980s and in 1990 their twins, Sharinna and Alexander were born. Ortiz withdrew from acting to manage his wife&#x27;s career and later retired completely to spend more time with his family. His son Shalim has gone on to become an international singing star and a spokesman for the American Diabetes Association. Ortiz suffered from Diabetes during his last years.

==Honors==
On December 12, 2013, Ortiz was honored with a ceremony and added to the list of illustrious Ponce citizens at the Park of the Illustrious Ponce Citizens in Ponce&#x27;s Tricentennial Park.
==Health and Death==
It was announced in 2015 that Ortiz was suffering Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. On June 13, 2016, son Shalim announced through the web that his father had died the day before. He was 81.

<text>Computer Modern is the original family of typefaces used by the typesetting program TeX. It was created by Donald Knuth with his Metafont program, and was most recently updated in 1992. Computer Modern and its variants remain very widely used in scientific publishing, especially in disciplines that make frequent use of mathematical notation.

==Design==

Computer Modern is a &quot;Didone&quot;, or modern serif font, a genre that emerged in the late 18th century as a contrast to the more organic designs that preceded them. Didone fonts have high contrast between thick and thin elements, and their axis of &quot;stress&quot; or thickening is perfectly vertical. Computer Modern was specifically based on the 10 point size of the American Lanston Monotype Company&#x27;s Modern Extended 8A, part of a family Monotype originally released in 1896. This was one of many modern faces issued by typefounders and Monotype around this period, and the standard style for body text printing in the late nineteenth century.

In creating the TeX publishing system, Knuth was influenced by the history of mathematics and a desire to achieve the &quot;classic style&quot; of books printed in metal type. Modern faces were used extensively for printing mathematics, especially before Times New Roman became popular for mathematics printing from the 1950s.

The most unusual characteristic of Computer Modern, however, is the fact that it is a complete type family designed with Knuth&#x27;s Metafont system, one of the few typefaces developed in this way. The Computer Modern source files are governed by 62 distinct parameters, controlling the widths and heights of various elements, the presence of serifs or old-style numerals, whether dots such as the dot on the &quot;i&quot; are square or rounded, and the degree of &quot;superness&quot; in the bowls of lowercase letters such as &quot;g&quot; and &quot;o&quot;. This allows Metafont designs to be processed in unusual ways; Knuth has shown effects such as morphing in demonstrations, where one font slowly transitions into another over the course of a text. While it attracted attention for the concept, Metafont has been used by few other font designers; by 1996 Knuth commented &quot;asking an artist to become enough of a mathematician to understand how to write a font with 60 parameters is too much&quot; while digital-period font designer Jonathan Hoefler commented in 2015 that &quot;Knuth&#x27;s idea that letters start with skeletal forms is flawed&quot;.

==Derived versions==

Knuth produced his original Computer Modern fonts using Metafont, a program that reads stroke-based definitions of glyphs and outputs ready-to-use fonts as bitmap image files. He mostly left the font, as with other components of TeX (with the exception of the TeX and Metafont names themselves, a stipulation Knuth made to maintain quality control), in the public domain.

The advance of publishing technology (PostScript, PDF, laser printers) has reduced the need for bitmap fonts. The preferred formats are now outline fonts such as Type 1, TrueType, or OpenType, which can be rendered efficiently at arbitrary resolution and using sophisticated anti-aliasing techniques by printer firmware or on-screen document viewers. Therefore, several other projects have ported the Computer Modern fonts into such formats. Some of these projects have also complemented Computer Modern with

* additional characters (euro, accented characters, Cyrillic and Greek script coverage)
* different font encodings (to overcome problems with Knuth&#x27;s original 8-bit character sets)
* additional font style variants

Several such derivatives are now also widely used and included in TeX Live, a modern TeX distribution.

===CMU===
A current extended release of the Computer Modern family in the general-purpose OpenType format is the CMU distribution (for Computer Modern Unicode):

* CMU Serif, the main Computer Modern font family. This includes the four traditional styles of font (regular, italic, bold, bold italic), and also:
** CMU Serif upright italic, an upright italic style similar to cursive upright handwriting
** CMU Serif bold non-extended, a bold weight duplexed to have the same width as the regular style
** CMU Serif roman and bold slanted, two oblique styles
** CMU Classical Serif, an italic design with slightly simpler serif designs
* Concrete Roman, a slab serif font in the four standard styles
* CMU Typewriter, a typewriter-style slab serif font
* CMU Sans Serif, a complementary sans-serif font, and CMU Bright, a lighter style of the same design
** CMU Sans demi-condensed, a condensed style of the same design

CMU is released under the SIL Open Font License.

===BlueSky===
 Computer Modern was first transformed to a PostScript Type 3 font format by BlueSky, Inc. in 1988, and then to Type 1 in 1992 to include font hinting. The Type 1 version has since then been donated to the American Mathematical Society (AMS) which distributes them freely under the Open Font License. It is found in most standard TeX distributions.

===Latin Modern===
The Latin Modern implementation, maintained by Bogusław Jackowski and Janusz M. Nowacki of TeX User Group Poland (GUST), is now standard in the TeX community and was made through a Metafont/MetaPost derivative called METATYPE1. It was derived from the BlueSky Type 1 fonts, which were converted back into outline-based METATYPE1 programs, from which then the extended Type 1 and OpenType Latin Modern fonts were developed. ConTeXt uses Latin Modern as default font, instead of Computer Modern.

The Type 1 to METATYPE1 to Type 1 round-trip conversion process involved in the production of the Latin Modern fonts tried to preserve the hinting information of the BlueSky fonts; however, it introduced rounding errors that affect the quality of the hinting at low pixel sizes. As a result, on-screen display of the Latin Modern fonts can result in a less even display of kerning and character heights than with the BlueSky fonts.

The same process was later extended to some free PostScript font clones under the umbrella project TeX Gyre.

The Latin Modern font has also gained an OpenType math table. Unlike Computer Modern Math, Latin Modern Math has no pairwise kerning information: OpenType math rendering does not make use of this type of kerning, making such information useless.

===New Computer Modern===
The New Computer Modern font family is a large extension in terms of the number of additional glyphs of the Latin Modern fonts which adds support for several more languages such as Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Cherokee and Coptic. This font family comes in two weights, &quot;Regular&quot; and &quot;Book&quot;. The book weight is supposed to look slightly heavier compared to the &quot;Regular&quot;. Both the weights include support for typesetting mathematics; complete coverage of unicode math blocks is provided, along with some more glyphs needed for mathematics.

===MLModern===
MLModern is based on the Latin Modern font. It avoids the spindliness of most other Type 1 versions of Computer Modern and hence looks thicker in comparison to Latin Modern or Computer Modern.

A visual comparison of Computer Modern, Latin Modern, New Computer Modern Book and MLModern is shown here.

===Others===
* EC fonts – look much like Computer Modern, but have slightly different metrics. These were the first TeX fonts to use the &quot;Cork encoding&quot; (in LaTeX also known as T1 encoding) that provides precomposed glyphs for West-European languages. The original EC fonts were only available as Metafont generated bitmaps.
* TC fonts – the TeX Companion fonts provide a number of additional symbols commonly used in text.
* BaKoMa fonts – another automatically generated Type1 version of Computer Modern by Basil K. Malyshev, dating to 1994. The fonts remain available for download after Malyshev&#x27;s 2019 death.
* CM-super – a very large extension of Computer Modern, available in a variety of encodings. These fonts were automatically vectorized from Computer Modern or EC font bitmaps and therefore lack the hinting information in the BlueSky fonts.
* CM-LGC – a Latin, Greek, Cyrillic extension.

<text>The woolly mouse opossum or long-furred woolly mouse opossum (&quot;Marmosa demerarae&quot;), known locally as the cuíca, is a South American marsupial of the family Didelphidae. Its range includes central Colombia, Venezuela, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, eastern Peru, northern Bolivia, and northern Brazil. It was formerly assigned to the genus &quot;Micoureus&quot;, which was made a subgenus of &quot;Marmosa&quot; in 2009.

It generally lives in tropical, humid forest below 1,200 meter elevation as in the Andes and surrounding lowlands. It is often found on plantations or other disturbed areas as well as evergreen forests.

<text>Ross Jewitt Dowson (September 4, 1917 – February 17, 2002) was a Canadian Trotskyist political figure and perennial candidate.

==Early life==
Dowson was born on September 4, 1917, the third of what was eventually a family of seven children in a working-class family in Weston, Ontario, then a suburb of Toronto. His father was a printer, an atheist and an anarchist sympathizer and his mother was a stenographer.

In the midst of the Great Depression, Dowson&#x27;s older brother, Murray, joined the Workers&#x27; Party of Canada, a Trotskyist organization, while a student at York Memorial Collegiate Institute and brought Ross along to meetings. The pair set up the York Memorial High School Spartacus Club. The younger Dowson joined the party and declared to his mother at the age of 17 that he intended to spend his life as a professional revolutionary. Harry Kopyto, a long-time friend and follower of Dowson, told the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; that Dowson &quot;got his politics from the hungry thirties, seeing working-class people share what they had while the upper class kept what they had to themselves... &quot;He believed in the social ownership and democratic control of the wealth of society.&quot;

As an entryist, Dowson joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Youth Movement (CCYM), the youth wing of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, in 1938 and but was expelled due to his political activities.

The Canadian Trotskyist movement collapsed at the beginning of World War II. Leaders such as Jack MacDonald and Maurice Spector had already left due to factional disputes and disagreements and the leader at the time the war broke out, Earle Birney, dropped out to focus on being a poet and because he disagreed with the Trotskyist position on the war. The movement suffered a further blow when the Socialist Workers League (as the Workers party was now called) was declared illegal under the Defence of Canada Regulations.

Ross and Murray Dowson remained with the group as it went underground. Dowson joined the Canadian Army in 1942 and rose to the rank of second lieutenant. He recruited two other soldiers to the Trotskyist movement and organized a successful strike for better pay by soldiers who had been assigned to lay and tamp train tracks in southern Ontario. Dowson was discharged from the army in December 1944.

Dowson was elected secretary of the Socialist Workers League in October 1944, and reorganized the movement, founding the Revolutionary Workers Party (RWP) with Dowson as national secretary and editor of its newspaper &quot;Labour Challenge&quot;.

Dowson ran for mayor of Toronto nine times in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. He campaigned openly as a Trotskyist under the slogan “Vote Dowson, Vote for a Labor Mayor, Vote for the Trotskyist Candidate” and garnered 11% of the vote in the 1948 mayoral election and over 20% of the vote in 1949.

==Cold War==
The RWP declined however due to the pressures of the Cold War and ended its activities. Its members joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) as an entrist faction known internally as &quot;The Club&quot; but continued to operate the Toronto Labor Bookstore on Yonge Street, run by Dowson, where they would also hold meetings and organize their activities. In order to save money, Dowson lived in the bookstore and lived a spartan lifestyle.

A split in the Fourth International in 1953 had ramifications in the RWP and in Dowson&#x27;s own family. Ross Dowson and the majority of the group sided with the faction led by James P. Cannon and the Socialist Workers Party (United States), this faction formed the International Committee of the Fourth International. His brother Murray and brother-in-law Joe Rosenthal formed a pro-Michel Pablo minority, and split from the RWP in 1954 to form a Trotskyist tendency within the CCF. It disappeared by the end of the decade.

==Federal politics==
Ross Dowson ran for the House of Commons of Canada on two occasions. He was a candidate in a 1957 by-election in the rural riding of Hastings—Frontenac, in which the CCF decided not to run a candidate. After Dowson said that he would be willing to join the CCF caucus should he be elected, CCF leader Major James Coldwell rejected the offer saying, &quot;In the unlikely event of Mr. Dowson winning the by-election he would certainly find no welcome from the CCF and no opportunity of aligning himself with us.&quot; Running under the &quot;Labour&quot; label, Dowson received only 266 votes in a two-way race against External Affairs minister Sidney Earle Smith.

In the 1958 general election, Dowson was again a candidate in the Toronto riding of Broadview. He placed fourth with 477 votes. This time he ran as a &quot;Socialist&quot; candidate, despite the fact that the democratic socialist CCF also stood a candidate.

Dowson also filed his nomination papers as a &quot;Labour&quot; candidate against new Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield in the 1967 Colchester—Hants by-election but withdrew when Elwood Smith entered the race as an independent candidate with informal NDP backing.

===Election results===

==1960s==
By 1961, Dowson and his Trotskyist group had returned to an entrism policy towards social democracy and joined the New Democratic Party (NDP) at its founding. In that year, the Trotskyist movement relaunched itself as the &quot;League for Socialist Action&quot; (LSA), with branches in Toronto and Vancouver and Dowson as national secretary.

Dowson was also editor of the LSA&#x27;s newspaper, which was first called &quot;Vanguard&quot; and later &quot;Labour Challenge&quot;. The LSA grew during the student radicalization of the late 1960s, bringing youth into the movement. He helped shape the national movement in Canada against the Vietnam War, devising the slogan &quot;End Canada&#x27;s Complicity in the War in Vietnam&quot;.

In 1963, Dowson played a role in the reunification of the Fourth International when he was sent to Europe with Joseph Hansen to help negotiate a settlement between the American and Canadian groups on one side and the International Secretariat of the Fourth International led by Ernest Mandel following the ouster of Pablo earlier in the decade.

In 1964, the LSA developed a Quebec counterpart, the &quot;Ligue Socialiste Ouvriere&quot; (Workers&#x27; Socialist League).

In the late 1960s, Canadian Marxist academics, under the influence of the then-predominant dependency theory, tended to view Canada as an economic colony of the United States. Dowson was influenced by this analysis, which also influenced the Waffle movement in the NDP. Dowson moved towards a position that held that Canadian nationalism was progressive against American imperialism, a view that put him in the minority in the LSA.

==Split from the LSA==
Dowson&#x27;s faction was defeated at the LSA&#x27;s 1973 convention and, in early 1974, he and about 20 supporters left the LSA and the United Secretariat of the Fourth International to form the Socialist League. This group came to be known as the &quot;Forward Group&quot; after the name of its newspaper. The group grew initially, but soon declined. By 1989, it had been reduced to a small group of friends around Dowson when he suffered a devastating stroke that left him unable to speak or write for the rest of his life.

==Dowson v RCMP==
Dowson and his organization became a target for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which labelled Dowson a &quot;subversive&quot; and monitored and attempted to interfere with his activities. As part of a 1972 action code named &quot;Operation Checkmate&quot;, the RCMP engaged in an attempt to disrupt and break-up the LSA and destroy the credibility of Dowson and another LSA leader, John Riddell. The LSA split the following year.

An investigation by the Ontario Provincial Police determined that RCMP officers engaged in what the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called a &quot;secret war&quot; against Dowson and the LSA since 1960 and that these actions involved what the OPP described as &quot;at least the apparent commission of crime ... by the RCMP security service.&quot;

Dowson and his followers subsequently spent 13 years attempting to prosecute the RCMP. In 1980, Attorney-General of Ontario Roy McMurtry intervened to quash attempts by Dowson and Riddell to lay charges against the RCMP on the basis that such a prosecution was not in the public interest and had no chance of success. The Supreme Court of Canada overturned McMurtry&#x27;s decision in 1983 allowing Dowson to commence a private prosecution but in 1985, the charges were dismissed by lower courts.

However, Dowson testified and provided evidence before two royal commissions investigating RCMP wrongdoings, including the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP, that were instrumental in the eventual replacement of the RCMP&#x27;s security service with a new agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.

==Personal life==
Professionally, Dowson was a machinist as a youth and later a lithographer and printer by training, but spent almost his entire working life as a full-time paid staffer (at times the only one) for the organization, for many years living in the organization&#x27;s bookstore. For the new generation of recruits in the 1960s and early 1970s, he was the major link to the older generation of class-struggle militants and Marxists who had built the labour and socialist movements in previous decades. He suffered a stroke in 1989 which left him paralyzed and almost unable to communicate for the rest of his life.

Dowson was a closeted gay man at a time when homosexuality was illegal and not accepted socially and concealed his sexual orientation through a celibate lifestyle.

Dowson&#x27;s brothers Hugh, Murray and his sisters Joyce (Dowson) Rosenthal and Lois (Dowson) Bédard were also active in the Trotskyist movement.

Dowson&#x27;s niece, Anne Lagacé Dowson, is a broadcaster and politician who was the New Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate in Westmount—Ville-Marie in the 2008 federal election.

<text>The bare-tailed woolly mouse opossum (&quot;Marmosa regina&quot;) or short-furred woolly mouse opossum is a South American marsupial of the family Didelphidae. Its range includes Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. It is found in tropical rainforest in the westernmost portion of the Amazon Basin and the eastern foothills of the Andes, at elevations up to 1634 m. It was formerly assigned to the genus &quot;Micoureus&quot;, which was made a subgenus of &quot;Marmosa&quot; in 2009. Some sources, such as the American Society of Mammalogists, believe this species is a synonym of the Isthmian mouse opossum.

<text>EMF are an English alternative rock band from Cinderford, Gloucestershire, who came to prominence at the beginning of the 1990s. During their initial eight-year run, from 1989 to 1997, the band released three studio albums before a hiatus. Their first single, &quot;Unbelievable&quot;, reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a number 1 hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Their debut album, &quot;Schubert Dip&quot;, went to number 3 on the UK Albums Chart.
In April 2022, EMF released their first album of new material in 27 years, &quot;Go Go Sapiens&quot;.

== Biography ==
===Formation (1989)===
All the members of the band were relatively well known in the Forest of Dean music scene before forming EMF in Cinderford in October 1989. Keyboard player Derry Brownson had formed a band called Flowerdrum but left to join bass guitarist Zac Foley, drummer Marc Decloedt, DJ Milf, and singer James Atkin as EMF. Ian Dench was the last to join, having already tasted moderate success as a guitarist for Apple Mosaic. The name EMF is an initialism of Epsom Mad Funkers, a name taken from a fan club of the band New Order in 1989.

The band&#x27;s music has been classified as indie rock. They toured the UK in 1990 with Stereo MCs.

===&quot;Schubert Dip&quot; and &quot;Stigma&quot; (1990–1992)===
In 1990, their debut single &quot;Unbelievable&quot; topped the charts in many countries around the world, reaching number 1 in the U.S. in July 1991. The single featured sampled utterances from comedian Andrew Dice Clay. In 1991, EMF released their debut album &quot;Schubert Dip&quot; which went to number 3 in the UK. The name was explained by songwriter Ian Dench, as &quot;If ever I&#x27;m short of a chord sequence, I nick one from Schubert.&quot; Successful singles from the album included &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Children&quot;, and &quot;Lies&quot;. &quot;Lies&quot; included a voice sample of Mark Chapman, John Lennon&#x27;s murderer. Yoko Ono, Lennon&#x27;s wife, achieved an injunction, and a modified version was included in future pressings.

In 1992, EMF returned with the &quot;Unexplained EP&quot; (including a cover version of &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;) and later &quot;Stigma&quot;, their second album. Both of these releases did poorly in the charts. The singles released were &quot;Getting Through&quot;, &quot;They&#x27;re Here&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot;.

Also in 1992, EMF appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s dance compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Dance&quot;, contributing &quot;Unbelievable (The Hovering Feet Mix)&quot;. The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities.

===&quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot; and first hiatus (1995–2000)===
EMF&#x27;s third album, &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot;, was released in 1995 and featured the singles &quot;Perfect Day&quot; and &quot;Bleeding You Dry&quot;. In the same year, EMF teamed with comedians Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer and recorded &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, a cover of The Monkees song. This single reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart.

Following the release of the &quot;Afro King&quot; single (which failed to do well), the band split up for the first time. However, all members of the band continued to play music. Ian Dench formed the indie rock band Whistler, which was active from 1998 to 2000. James Atkin formed the big beat trio Cooler and Derry Brownson formed the alternative rock trio LK. Zac Foley became the bass player for Carrie.

===Reunion and second hiatus (2001–2006)===
In 2001, EMF played a reunion gig in London. They also released a greatest hits album: &quot;Epsom Mad Funkers: The Best of EMF&quot;.

Zac Foley died on 3 January 2002 at the age of 31, due to an overdose of non-prescribed drugs. Following his death, EMF played just four more gigs in late 2002 before splitting again.

===Second reunion and third hiatus (2007–2009)===
In 2007 the band reformed to play a one-off gig at the Scala in King&#x27;s Cross, London, on 18 December. The place of Foley was taken by Richard March, formerly of Pop Will Eat Itself and Bentley Rhythm Ace.

In 2008 EMF played the Portsmouth Festival on 9 October and supported Carter USM at Birmingham Academy and London&#x27;s Brixton Academy in November that year.

In May 2009 EMF announced that due to personal issues, the band would not be doing any more shows in the near future, thus ending their second reunion.

===Third reunion (2012–2019)===
In 2012, they reformed to play at the inaugural festival Lakefest in Tewkesbury, alongside Levellers and Dodgy, on 18 and 19 May. The band welcomed new bassist Stevey Marsh during this show. For the first time, they performed every track from the album &quot;Schubert Dip&quot; in order to coincide with the 21st anniversary re-release. The band headlined at the Westbury Festival on 25 August 2012. In December 2012 the band played &quot;Schubert Dip&quot; and &quot;Stigma&quot; from start to finish at the Gloucester Guildhall. The show was recorded and sold as a live Blu-ray/DVD titled &quot;Videodrome: Long Live the New Flesh&quot;.

On 1 October 2016 the band headlined Indie Daze in London.

===&quot;From Us To You&quot; and &quot;Go Go Sapiens&quot; (2020–present)===
In 2020, the band released a career-spanning vinyl box set titled &quot;From Us to You&quot;. It contained all the full-length albums remastered, and a fourth disc containing unreleased demos and non-album tracks. On 1 April 2022, the band released an all-new material album, titled &quot;Go Go Sapiens&quot;. Its first single, &quot;Sister Sandinista&quot;, was released 1 March 2022. They also embarked on a short UK tour in early April 2022.

<text>The School of General Studies (GS) is a liberal arts college and one of the undergraduate colleges of Columbia University, situated on the university&#x27;s main campus in Morningside Heights, New York City. GS is known primarily for its traditional B.A. program for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of at least one year or are pursuing dual degrees). GS students make up almost 30% of the Columbia undergraduate population.

GS offers dual-degree programs with several leading universities around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://gs.columbia.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It offers dual degrees with List College of the Jewish Theological Seminary, Sciences Po in France, Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, Tel Aviv University in Israel, and City University of Hong Kong. It also offers the BA/MA Option with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Combined Plan and the MS Express program with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and five-year joint degrees with the School of International and Public Affairs. GS offers the Postbaccalaureate Premedical Program, the oldest and largest program of its kind in the United States.

Notable alumni include Nobel Prize winners Simon Kuznets, Baruj Benacerraf, and Louise Glück, as well as Scott Mandel, J.D. Salinger, Amelia Earhart, Leonard Cohen and Princess Firyal of Jordan.

==History==
===Predecessor institutions===
GS&#x27;s evolutionary ancestor is the now-defunct, all-male Seth Low College, named for former Brooklyn mayor and President of Columbia Seth Low. It was established in Downtown Brooklyn in 1928 to help alleviate the flood of Jewish applicants to Columbia College. The entrance requirements for Seth Low Junior College were reportedly the same as those enforced in Columbia College. Following completion of the two-year program, graduates could complete their undergraduate degrees at the university&#x27;s professional schools, such as the School of Law, Business School, or School of Engineering and Applied Science (all of which conferred terminal bachelor&#x27;s degrees at the time) or earn B.S. degrees in the liberal arts as University Undergraduates.

Seth Low Junior College was closed in 1936 due to the adverse economic effects of the Great Depression and concomitant popularity of the tuition-free Brooklyn College in 1930. Henceforth, its remaining students were absorbed into the Morningside Heights campus as students in the University Undergraduate program, which was established by Nicholas Murray Butler in 1904.

University Extension was responsible for the founding of the Columbia Business School, the School of General Studies and the School of Dental and Oral Surgery (now the College of Dental Medicine). The School of Continuing Education (now the School of Professional Studies), a separate school, was later established to reprise University Extension&#x27;s former role.

===The Establishment of the School of General Studies===
With an influx of students attending the university on the GI Bill following the resolution of World War II, in December 1946, the University Undergraduate program was reorganized as an official undergraduate college for &quot;qualified students who, because of employment or for other reasons, are unable to attend other schools of the University.&quot; Columbia University pioneered the use of the term &quot;General Studies&quot; when naming the college, adapting the medieval term for universities, &quot;Studium Generale.&quot; Thus, the School of General Studies bears no semblance to general studies or extension studies programs at other universities in the United States. In December 1968, the University Council permitted GS to grant the B.A. degree instead of the B.S. degree (over the objections of some members of the Columbia College Faculty).

===Merging of Columbia College and School of General Studies Faculties===
In 1991, the Columbia College (CC), School of General Studies (GS), and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) faculties were merged into the Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences, which resulted in the complete academic integration between the School of General Studies and Columbia College. As a result, both GS and CC students receive B.A. degrees conferred by the Trustees of Columbia University through the Faculty of Art &amp; Sciences, and GS is recognized as an official liberal arts college at Columbia University.

== Academics ==

GS students make up almost 30% of the Columbia undergraduate population and in 2013 were reported as consistently collectively earning the highest average GPA among undergraduates at Columbia University. Approximately 20% of GS students are part-time students who have significant, full-time work commitments in addition to their academic responsibilities. Numerous GS students have gone on to win prestigious fellowships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, and the Fulbright Scholarship.

The School of General Studies confers the degree of Bachelor of Arts in more than 70 majors. All GS students are required to complete the Core Curriculum, which includes University Writing, Literature/Humanities, Contemporary Civilization/Social Science, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, Global Core, Quantitative Reasoning, Science, and Foreign Language.

GS offers dual degree programs with Sciences Po, the City University of Hong Kong, Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, Tel Aviv University, and List College of the Jewish Theological Seminary. It also offers dual degree programs with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School of International and Public Affairs, and Columbia Business School. GS has a Post-baccalaureate Premedical Program, the oldest program of its kind.

==Admission==
Admission to Columbia GS requires an online application, official high school (or GED) transcripts, an essay of 1,500-2,000 words, and two recommendation letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://gs.columbia.edu/applying-gs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews are conducted in person and over phone.

==Dual degree programs==
===Joint Program with the Jewish Theological Seminary – Albert A. List College===
Since 1954, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) and the School of General Studies have offered a joint degree program leading to a B.A. from Columbia University and a B.A. from List College. Professor Lisa Rosen-Metsch, Dean of the School of General Studies, is an alumna of the Joint Program.

===Dual BA with Sciences Po Paris===
The Dual BA Program is a unique program in which undergraduate students earn two Bachelor of Arts degrees in four years from both Columbia University and Sciences Po, one of the most prestigious universities in France and Europe. This program is geared towards traditionally-aged applicants in high school, and is one of the most selective undergraduate programs in the nation.

Students spend two years at one of four Sciences Po campuses in France (Le Havre, Menton, Poitiers, or Reims), each of which is devoted to a particular region of the world. At Sciences Po, undergraduates can pursue majors in political science, economics, law, finance, history, among others. After two years at Sciences Po, students matriculate at Columbia University, where they complete the Core Curriculum and one of over 70 majors offered at Columbia. Graduates of the program are guaranteed admission to a Sciences Po graduate program.

===Joint Bachelor&#x27;s Degree with City University of Hong Kong===
This program is open to top-ranked undergraduates enrolled at the City University of Hong Kong and allows graduates to receive two bachelor&#x27;s degrees from the City University and Columbia in four years. Undergraduates spend their first two years at the City University and their final two years at Columbia, where they complete the Core Curriculum and choose one of 70 majors offered at Columbia.

===Dual BA Program with Trinity College Dublin===
The Dual bachelor&#x27;s degree Program with Trinity College Dublin is a unique program in which undergraduate students earn two Bachelor of Arts degrees in four years from both Columbia University and Trinity College Dublin. Trinity College Dublin is the oldest university in Ireland and is widely considered to be its most prestigious institution. This program is geared towards traditionally-aged applicants in high school.

===Tel Aviv University and Columbia University Dual Degree Program===
The Tel Aviv Columbia Dual Degree Program allows undergraduates to earn two bachelor&#x27;s degrees over the course of four years. Students spend the first two years of their undergraduate careers at Tel Aviv and then spend their final two years at Columbia while completing the Core Curriculum and major. Tel Aviv University is considered to be one of Israel&#x27;s leading and most prestigious institutions. This program is geared towards traditionally-aged applicants in high school.
===Combined Plan with the School of Engineering and Applied Science===
GS students are eligible for competitive admission to the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) through the Columbia Combined Plan program, under the condition that they complete the necessary pre-engineering courses with a high GPA and obtain recommendations from 3 instructors. Students in the program receive a B.A. in a liberal arts discipline from GS and a B.S. in an engineering discipline from SEAS. Students may apply for the Combined Plan program in their junior (3-2 program) or senior (4–2) year of undergraduate study.

<text>A log cabin is a small log house, especially a minimally finished or less architecturally sophisticated structure. Log cabins have an ancient history in Europe, and in America are often associated with first-generation home building by settlers.

==History==
===Europe===
Construction with logs was described by Roman architect Vitruvius Pollio in his architectural treatise &quot;De Architectura&quot;. He noted that in Pontus in present-day northeastern Turkey, dwellings were constructed by laying logs horizontally overtop of each other and filling in the gaps with &quot;chips and mud&quot;.

Log cabin construction has its roots in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. Although their precise origin is uncertain, the first log structures were probably being built in Northern Europe by the Bronze Age around 3500 BC. C. A. Weslager describes Europeans as having: 

A medieval log cabin was considered movable property, evidenced by the relocation of Espåby in 1557, where the buildings were disassembled, transported to a new location, and reassembled. It was also common to replace individual logs damaged by dry rot as necessary.

The Wood Museum in Trondheim, Norway, displays fourteen different traditional profiles, but a basic form of log construction was used all over North Europe and Asia and later imported to America.

Log construction was especially suited to Scandinavia, where straight, tall tree trunks (pine and spruce) are readily available. With suitable tools, a log cabin can be erected from scratch in days by a family. As no chemical reaction is involved, such as hardening of mortar, a log cabin can be erected in any weather or season. Many older towns in Northern Scandinavia have been built exclusively out of log houses, which have been decorated by board paneling and wood cuttings. Today, construction of modern log cabins as leisure homes is a fully developed industry in Finland and Sweden. Modern log cabins often feature fiberglass insulation and are sold as prefabricated kits machined in a factory, rather than hand-built in the field like ancient log cabins.

Log cabins are mostly constructed without the use of nails and thus derive their stability from simple stacking, with only a few dowel joints for reinforcement. This is because a log cabin tends to compress slightly as it settles, over a few months or years. Nails would soon be out of alignment and torn out.

Log cabins were largely built from logs laid horizontally and interlocked on the ends with notches. Some log cabins were built without notches and simply nailed together, but this was not as structurally sound. 

The most important aspect of cabin building is the site upon which the cabin was built. Site selection was aimed at providing the cabin inhabitants with both sunlight and drainage to make them better able to cope with the rigors of frontier life. Proper site selection placed the home in a location best suited to manage the farm or ranch. When the first pioneers built cabins, they were able to &quot;cherry pick&quot; the best logs for cabins. These were old-growth trees with few limbs (knots) and straight with little taper. Such logs did not need to be hewn to fit well together. Careful notching minimized the size of the gap between the logs and reduced the amount of chinking (sticks or rocks) or daubing (mud) needed to fill the gap. The length of one log was generally the length of one wall, although this was not a limitation for most good cabin builders.

Decisions had to be made about the type of cabin. Styles varied greatly from one part of North America to another: the size of the cabin, the number of stories, type of roof, the orientation of doors and windows all needed to be taken into account when the cabin was designed. In addition, the source of the logs, the source of stone and available labor, either human or animal, had to be considered. If timber sources were further away from the site, the cabin size might be limited.

Cabin corners were often set on large stones; if the cabin was large, other stones were used at other points along the sill (bottom log). Since they were usually cut into the sill, thresholds were supported with rock as well. These stones are found below the corners of many 18th-century cabins as they are restored. Cabins were set on foundations to keep them out of damp soil but also to allow for storage or basements to be constructed below the cabin. Cabins with earth floors had no need for foundations.

===United States and Canada===




In North America, cabins were constructed using a variety of notches. One method common in the Ohio River Valley in Southwestern Ohio and Southeastern Indiana is the block house end method, which is exemplified in the David Brown House in Rising Sun, Indiana.

Some older buildings in the Midwestern United States and the Canadian Prairies are log structures covered with clapboards or other materials. 19th-century cabins used as dwellings were occasionally plastered on the interior. The O&#x27;Farrell Cabin () in Boise, Idaho, had backed wallpaper used over newspaper. The C.C.A. Christenson Cabin in Ephraim, Utah () was plastered over willow lath. Log cabins reached their peak of complexity and elaboration with the Adirondack-style cabins of the mid-19th century. This style was the inspiration for many United States Park Service lodges built at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century.

Log cabin building never died out or fell out of favor. It was surpassed by the needs of a growing urban United States. During the 1930s and the Great Depression, the Roosevelt administration directed the Civilian Conservation Corps to build log lodges throughout the west for use by the Forest Service and the National Park Service. Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was such a log structure, and it was dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1930, the world&#x27;s largest log cabin was constructed at a private resort in Montebello, Quebec, Canada. Often described as a log château, it serves as the Château Montebello hotel.

The modern version of a log cabin is the log home, which is a house built usually from milled logs. The logs are visible on the exterior and sometimes interior of the house. These cabins are mass manufactured, traditionally in Scandinavian countries and increasingly in Eastern Europe. Squared milled logs are precut for easy assembly. Log homes are popular in rural areas, and even in some suburban locations. In many resort communities in the Western United States, homes of log and stone measuring over are not uncommon. These &quot;kit&quot; log homes are one of the largest consumers of logs in the Western United States.

In the United States, log homes have embodied a traditional approach to home building, one that has resonated throughout American history. Log homes represent a technology that allows a home to be built with a high degree of sustainability. They are frequently considered to be on the leading edge of the green building movement.

Crib barns were a popular type of barn found throughout the American Southern and Southeastern regions. Crib barns were especially ubiquitous in the Appalachian and Ozark Mountain states of North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas. In Europe, modern log cabins are often built in gardens and used as summerhouses, home offices, or as an additional room in the garden. Summer houses and cottages are often built from logs in Northern Europe.

Chinking refers to a broad range of mortar or other infill materials used between the logs in the construction of log cabins and other log-walled structures. Traditionally, dried mosses, such as &quot;Pleurozium schreberi&quot; or &quot;Hylocomium splendens&quot;, were used in the Nordic countries as an insulator between logs. In the United States, &quot;Chinks&quot; were small stones or wood or corn cobs stuffed between the logs.

In the United States, settlers may have first constructed log cabins by 1640. Historians believe that the first log cabins built in North America were in the Swedish colony of New Sweden along the Delaware River and Brandywine River valleys. 

Most of the settlers were actually Forest Finns, a heavily oppressed Finnish ethnic group originally from Savonia and Tavastia, who starting from the 1500s were displaced or persuaded to go inhabit and practice slash and burn agriculture (which they were famous for in eastern Finland) in the deep forests of inland Sweden and Norway, during Sweden&#x27;s 600+ year colonial rule over Finland, who since 1640 were being captured and displaced to the colony. 

After arriving, they would escape the Fort Christina center where the Swedes lived, to go and live in the forest as they did back home. They encountered the Lenape Indian tribe, with whom they found many cultural similarities, including slash and burn agriculture, sweat lodges and saunas, and a love of forests, and they ended up living alongside and even culturally assimilating with them(they are the earlier and lesser-known Findian tribe, being overshadowed by the Ojibwe Findians of Minnesota, Michigan and Ontario, Canada). In those forests, the first log cabins of America were built, using traditional Finnish methods. Even though New Sweden existed only briefly before it was absorbed by the Dutch colony of New Netherland, which was eventually taken over by the English, these quick and easy construction techniques of the Finns not only remained, but spread.

Germans and Ukrainians also used this technique. The contemporaneous British settlers had no tradition of building with logs, but they quickly adopted the method. The first English settlers did not widely use log cabins, building in forms more traditional to them. Few log cabins dating from the 18th century still stand, but they were often not intended as permanent dwellings. Possibly the oldest surviving log house in the United States is the C. A. Nothnagle Log House () in New Jersey. Settlers often built log cabins as temporary homes to live in while constructing larger, permanent houses; then they either demolished the log structures or used them as outbuildings, such as barns or chicken coops.

Log cabins were sometimes hewn on the outside so that siding might be applied; they also might be hewn inside and covered with a variety of materials, ranging from plaster over lath to wallpaper.

Log cabins were constructed with either a purlin roof structure or a rafter roof structure. A purlin roof consists of horizontal logs that are notched into the gable-wall logs. The latter are progressively shortened to form the characteristic triangular gable end. The steepness of the roof was determined by the reduction in size of each gable-wall log as well as the total number of gable-wall logs. Flatter roofed cabins might have had only 2 or 3 gable-wall logs while steeply pitched roofs might have had as many gable-wall logs as a full story. Issues related to eave overhang and a porch also influenced the layout of the cabin.

The decision about roof type often was based on the material for roofing like bark. Milled lumber was usually the most popular choice for rafter roofs in areas where it was available. These roofs typify many log cabins built in the 20th century, having full-cut 2×4 rafters covered with pine and cedar shingles. The purlin roofs found in rural settings and locations, where milled lumber was not available, often were covered with long hand-split shingles.

The log cabin has been a symbol of humble origins in U.S. politics since the early 19th century. At least seven U.S. presidents were born in log cabins, including Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, and James A. Garfield. Although William Henry Harrison was not born in a log cabin, he and the Whigs were among the first to use them during the 1840 presidential election as a symbol to show Americans that he was a man of the people. Other candidates followed Harrison&#x27;s example, making the idea of a log cabin a recurring theme in U.S. presidential campaigns.

More than a century after Harrison, Adlai Stevenson II said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t born in a log cabin. I didn&#x27;t work my way through school nor did I rise from rags to riches, and there&#x27;s no use trying to pretend I did.&quot; Stevenson lost the 1952 presidential election in a landslide to Dwight D. Eisenhower.

A popular children&#x27;s toy in the United States is Lincoln Logs, which are various notched dowel rods that can be fitted together to build scale miniature-sized structures.

<text>Stephen F. Austin State University (SFASU or SFA) is a public university in Nacogdoches, Texas, United States. It was founded as a teachers&#x27; college in 1923 and subsequently renamed after one of Texas&#x27;s founding fathers, Stephen F. Austin. Its campus resides on part of the homestead of Thomas Jefferson Rusk. On May 11, 2023, the university joined the University of Texas System; it was previously one of two public universities in the state not affiliated with one of Texas&#x27;s seven university systems.

It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. Though the university is located in the rural East Texas college town of Nacogdoches, the vast majority of SFA students come from Greater Houston, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, and other cities throughout Texas. SFA has also served students from 46 states outside Texas and 42 countries outside the United States.

The SFA Lumberjacks are members of the Southland Conference and compete in Division I for all varsity sports. The Lumberjacks football team competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision. The Lumberjacks basketball team has made five appearances in the NCAA Division I Tournament, with two upset first-round wins in 2014 and 2016.

==Academics==

Stephen F. Austin offers more than 120 areas of study, including more than 80 undergraduate majors, nearly 60 graduate degrees, and four doctoral programs. Stephen F. Austin offers classes through six colleges and one independent school.

The Arthur Temple College of Forestry and Agriculture is nationally recognized, and houses one of only two schools of forestry in the State of Texas (and the only forestry college in the timber-producing East Texas region). It was responsible for mapping and recovery of debris and remains from Space Shuttle Columbia that fell on its premises in 2003.

During the 2021-2022 academic year, there were 2,792 degrees awarded. Of those degrees, 2,230 (79%) were undergraduate, 552 were post-graduate (20%), and 10 (1%) were doctoral.

Since 2007, Stephen F. Austin has served as the headquarters of the Association for Business Communication. It is also the home of the &quot;National Center for Pharmaceutical Crops&quot;, which in 2011 discovered a potential cancer-fighting agent from the extract of giant salvinia, one of the world&#x27;s most notorious invasive species.

==Campus==

In addition to the main campus which encompasses 430 acres, the university maintains a agricultural research center for beef, poultry, and swine production and an equine center; an observatory for astronomy research, a 2,650-acre experimental forest in southwestern Nacogdoches County and a forestry field station on the Sam Rayburn Reservoir. SFA has purple lights visible on top of the tallest buildings on campus, Steen Hall. A purple light also is illuminated in the Student Center clock tower.

==Athletics==

In tribute to the forestry industry, which is a major component of the area&#x27;s economy, the men&#x27;s athletic teams are called Lumberjacks, and women&#x27;s teams are known as Ladyjacks. &quot;Lumberjacks&quot; name was chosen in 1923, when T. E. Ferguson, a professor of English at SFA, submitted name to the students and faculty assembly. The choice was made given the university&#x27;s location in the Piney Woods, where forestry and timber products are a major part of the area&#x27;s economy. Most of SFA&#x27;s athletic teams participate in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), which hosts teams from the states of Texas, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Utah, and Washington. SFA joined the WAC in July 2021 after 34 years in the Southland Conference (SLC). Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s colors are purple and white. In July 2024, SFA will re-join the Southland Conference

Men&#x27;s NCAA sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor &amp; outdoor track and field. Women&#x27;s NCAA sports include basketball, beach volleyball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor &amp; outdoor track and field, soccer, softball, tennis, and (indoor) volleyball.
SFA&#x27;s football team competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) in the United Athletic Conference (UAC), formed after the 2022 season as a football-only merger of the WAC and ASUN Conference. SFA&#x27;s football team earned a berth into the FCS playoffs in 2009, which was the first for the university since 1995. The team also earned a playoff berth in 2010, marking the first time in the program&#x27;s history that the team had reached the playoffs in consecutive seasons. The 2010 season also marked the first time that the school had won an outright conference championship since 1989. Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s only bowl appearance was the 1973 Poultry Bowl, in which the team defeated Gardner–Webb 31–10.

The men&#x27;s basketball team reached its first NCAA tournament in 2009 after winning the Southland Conference regular season and tournament. They lost 59–44 to Syracuse. In their second appearance in 2014, they upset VCU in overtime, 77–75. In their third appearance in 2016, they upset 3rd seeded West Virginia 70–56. In the second round against 6th seeded Notre Dame they lost 77–76 on a buzzer beater by Notre Dame&#x27;s Rex Pflueger. On November 26, 2019, in arguably the biggest upset in NCAA Division I basketball in 15 years, SFA upset #1-ranked Duke in overtime by a score of 85–83. This was the first home game against a nonconference opponent that Duke had lost in the Blue Devils&#x27; past 150 home games.

In 2020, the athletic department of Stephen F. Austin was found by the NCAA to have had several administrative errors in reporting the grades of the student athletes from 2013 to 2019, which resulted in the university having academically ineligible players to be on rosters. As a result, the SFA&#x27;s football, men and women&#x27;s basketball teams victories from this time span (including the 2016 men&#x27;s basketball team win over WVU and the Southland Conference titles from 2014 to 2018) had to be vacated.

In July 2021, SFA joined the Western Athletic Conference. SFA houses three sports outside the WAC—football in the UAC; beach volleyball (a women-only NCAA sport) in the Sun Belt Conference; and bowling (another women-only sport) in Conference USA, which absorbed SFA&#x27;s former bowling home of the Southland Bowling League after the 2022–23 season.

In July 2024, SFA left the WAC and joined the Southland Conference along with another Texas school, the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley.

<doc id="639826" wikidata="Q7432933" url="?curid=639826" title="Schubert Dip">
<text>Schubert Dip is the debut album by British rock band EMF, released on Parlophone Records on 7 May 1991. It features the worldwide hit single &quot;Unbelievable&quot; which reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The name of the album is a pun on the name of the popular sweet sherbet dip and the 19th-century composer Franz Schubert.

== Critical reception ==
Alex Henderson of AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, feeling that overall it was not as good as the standout single &quot;Unbelievable&quot;: &quot;The only song that comes close to packing the punch of &#x27;Unbelievable&#x27; is the intoxicating &#x27;Long Summer Days&#x27;. For the most part, &quot;Schubert Dip&quot; is a prime example of an album that is simply decent when it should have been excellent.&quot;

== Track listing ==
All songs written and composed by James Atkin, Derry Brownson, Mark Decloedt, Ian Dench &amp; Zac Foley, except where noted.

# &quot;Children&quot; – 5:15
# &quot;Long Summer Days&quot; – 4:00
# &quot;When You&#x27;re Mine&quot; (Dench) – 3:22
# &quot;Travelling Not Running&quot; (Dench) – 4:20
# &quot;I Believe&quot; – 3:43
# &quot;Unbelievable&quot; – 3:29
# &quot;Girl of an Age&quot; – 3:56
# &quot;Admit It&quot; (Dench) – 3:28
# &quot;Lies&quot; (Dench) – 4:27 (4:19 on reissue)
# &quot;Longtime&quot; – 4:25 (original length was 8:10, as it included &quot;EMF&quot; as a hidden track)
# &quot;EMF&quot; (Live at the Bilson) – 3:54 (hidden track on the original, later listed separately on reissue)

Note
*The track &quot;Lies&quot; on the first pressings of &quot;Schubert Dip&quot; originally began with a sample of the voice of John Lennon&#x27;s assassin, Mark David Chapman, reciting the first two lines of the lyrics to Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Watching the Wheels&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s widow, Yoko Ono, objected to this sample and as a result all subsequent pressings of the album have omitted the sample of Chapman&#x27;s voice.
*The Hungarian speech at the beginning of the track &quot;Travelling Not Running&quot;: &quot;&quot; (&quot;It is impossible to harm the oppositionist, the final result will decide it...&quot;) was spoken by János Berecz, a Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party politician at the end of the Iron Curtain era.

Sample credits
*&quot;Unbelievable&quot; includes samples of US comedian Andrew Dice Clay throughout the track.
*The song &quot;Girl of an Age&quot; contains a sample of the character Ernie from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; speaking to his friend Bert.
*The song &quot;Longtime&quot; contains a sample of a reading of &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; by T. S. Eliot.

Ash Ketchum, a young boy from Pallet Town, comes of age and gains the right to be a Pokémon Trainer, hoping to achieve his dream of becoming a Pokémon Master; Trainers receive their first Pokémon from Professor Samuel Oak, the town&#x27;s foremost authority on researching Pokémon. Though Ash oversleeps and arrives late to Professor Oak&#x27;s lab, he receives a Pikachu, who is initially uncooperative. On their way to Viridian City, Ash earns Pikachu&#x27;s friendship by selflessly shielding him from a group of angry Spearow. While Pikachu&#x27;s injuries are treated in Viridian City&#x27;s Pokémon Center, Ash is confronted by Misty, a girl whose bike he desperately stole and wrecked in his attempt to escape the Spearow, so she declares that she will not leave Ash&#x27;s side until she is properly compensated. Suddenly, a trio of criminals from the organization Team Rocket — Jessie, James, and Meowth — appear to steal Pokémon from the center. Pikachu overpowers them, which convinces the trio of his teamwork value and inspires numerous subsequent attempts to steal him. In order to compete in a Pokémon League Tournament, Ash must defeat Gym Leaders and earn badges as evidence of his victories.

Content was also available on the Pokémon TV app and website.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
In a February 2008 review for IGN, Jeffrey Harris gave the &quot;Indigo League&quot; series a score of 2 out of 10, saying: &quot;Ultimately, the show&#x27;s story is boring, repetitive, and formulaic. The show constantly preaches about friendship and helping others. ... Nearly every episode features Ash, Misty, and Brock on a trip. Team Rocket tries the latest scheme to catch Pikachu or whatever else, and fails miserably.&quot; He concluded: &quot;at the end of the day, this franchise feels more like crass marketing trying to preach the importance of friend and companionship.&quot; In an April 2008 review, Common Sense Media gave the series 3 out of 5 stars, saying: &quot;Over the years, the energetic, imagination-filled, Japanese-inspired fantasy series has cut across cultural, gender, and age barriers to captivate a global audience of girls, boys, and even adults&quot;, but added: &quot;Folks may also find the franchise&#x27;s massive commercial appeal disturbing, especially since the show is mainly geared towards kids.&quot;

Carl Kimlinger, in an August 2008 review of the &quot;Diamond and Pearl&quot; series for Anime News Network, gave the dubbed series an overall grade of C. He wrote: &quot;The formula has been set in stone … Ash and buddies wander around, meet a new or trainer, fight, make friends, and then use their newfound Power of Friendship to stave off an attack by the nefarious Team Rocket&quot;, and added: &quot;even the tournaments are a relief, a blessed pause in the cerebrum-liquefying formula as Ash and company square off against destined rivals for an episode or two.&quot; However, he stated that it would be enjoyed by its target audience, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s colorful, silly and lively (if insanely simplistic and cheap)&quot; and added: &quot;Parents will appreciate the absolute lack of objectionable content (aside from the promotion of animism) and the series&#x27; impeccably PC message of friendship, cooperation and acceptance&quot;. He criticized the series&#x27; soundtrack as &quot;tin-eared&quot; and &quot;bad video game music&quot;.

Kevin McFarland, in a 2016 binge-watching guide of the &quot;Indigo League&quot; series for &quot;Wired&quot;, described the series as &quot;a kids program that emphasizes the value of hard work, the importance of family and close friendship, and the ideals of love, trust, and honor. But it&#x27;s also a largely silly show with slapstick comedy and colorful battle sequences, making Ash&#x27;s Sisyphean task to become the world&#x27;s best Pokémon trainer continually entertaining.&quot;

&quot;Paste&quot; ranked the series at 44th place in its October 2018 list of &quot;The 50 Best Anime Series of All Time&quot;, with Sarra Sedghi writing: &quot;To the joy of &#x27;90s kids everywhere, &quot;Pokémon&quot; helped solidify anime (and, hopefully, good punnery) in the West&quot;. She added: &quot;&quot;Pokémon&quot; may not be high artistry (because, you know, it&#x27;s for children), but the show&#x27;s pervasiveness is a testament to the power of nostalgia.&quot; IGN ranked the series at 70th place in its list of &quot;Top 100 Animated Series&quot;, saying that the series &quot;had clever writing and a golden marketing formula designed to spread Nintendo&#x27;s Pokémon videogames into new, lucrative territory.&quot;

===Controversies===

&quot;Pokémon&quot; has had several anime episodes removed from the rotation in Japan or the rest of the world. The most infamous of these episodes was . The episode made headlines worldwide when it caused 685 children to experience seizures and seizure-like symptoms caused by a repetitive flash of light. Although the offending sequence was caused by Pikachu&#x27;s actions, the episode&#x27;s featured Pokémon, Porygon, has rarely been seen in future episodes, with appearances limited to one brief cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Pokémon Heroes&quot; and in one scene-bumper later in season 1. Its evolutions Porygon2 and Porygon-Z have only appeared in a brief part of the opening sequence of &quot;Pokémon the Movie: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice&quot;. Several other episodes have been removed from broadcast in Japan due to contemporary disasters that resemble events in the program; the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the 2014 Sinking of MV &quot;Sewol&quot;, all have caused cancellations or indefinite or temporary postponements of episode broadcasts. In the United States, the September 11 attacks in 2001 as well as 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Katrina led to the temporary removal of two episodes from syndication.

On September 1, 2006, China banned the series from prime time broadcasting (from 17:00 to 20:00), as it did Western animated series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, to protect its struggling animation studios. The ban was later extended by one hour.

On August 18, 2016, the &quot;XYZ&quot; episode (&quot;Down to the Fiery Finish!&quot; in the English dub) faced criticism from fans when Ash lost the Kalos League against Alain. The fans specifically criticized the episode due to the misleading name and trailers that suggested that Ash would win the battle and because Ash had lost all of the Pokémon Leagues in past seasons. Fans also disliked the outcome because they believed Ash&#x27;s Greninja had many advantages over Alain&#x27;s Charizard, including the fact that Water-type Pokémon resist Fire-type Pokémon attacks, and that the rare Bond Phenomenon Ash&#x27;s Greninja was subject to was said to be far more powerful than a conventional Mega Evolution. Several animators of the series also expressed disappointment that Ash had lost. TV Tokyo&#x27;s YouTube upload of the teaser of the next episode received an overwhelming number of dislikes as a result of the outcome.

===Influence===
The series is considered to be one of the first anime series on television to reach this level of mainstream success with Western audiences. It has also been credited with allowing the game series to reach a high degree of popularity, and vice versa.

<text>The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)&#x27;s radio astronomy observatories are collectively known as the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF), with the facility supporting Australia&#x27;s research in radio astronomy. It is part of CSIRO&#x27;s business unit known as CSIRO Space and Astronomy.

CSIRO currently operates four observatories as part of the ATNF. Three are in New South Wales near the towns of Parkes, Coonabarabran and Narrabri.The fourth telescope, the next generation Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western Australia. These telescopes can be used together as a long baseline array for use in very long baseline interferometry.

Radio telescopes included in the ATNF:
* The Australia Telescope Compact Array
* The Parkes Observatory
* The Mopra Observatory
* The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder

<text>The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) is a radio telescope operated by CSIRO at the Paul Wild Observatory, twenty five kilometres (16 mi) west of the town of Narrabri in New South Wales, Australia. Its opening ceremony took place on September 2, 1988.

==Overview==
The telescope is an array of six identical diameter dishes, which commonly operate in aperture synthesis mode to produce radio images. Five of the dishes can be moved along a three-kilometre (2 mi) railway track oriented east-west. The sixth antenna is situated three kilometres west of the end of the main track. Each dish weighs about .

The Compact Array is a part of the Australia Telescope National Facility network of radio telescopes. The array is frequently operated together with other CSIRO telescopes, the dish at the Parkes Observatory and a single dish at Mopra (near Coonabarabran), to form a very long baseline interferometry array.

The Array welcomes visitors from the general public. The facility includes a Visitor&#x27;s Centre where the operations of the array can be observed in comfort and shade, and it has a range of informational displays and audiovisual presentations, while the surrounding grounds have displays and activities for visitors. Open Days are run regularly, and to mark special events such as the anniversary of the first Moon landing, or major anniversaries of the telescope itself.

The children&#x27;s/teen&#x27;s television adventure series &quot;Sky Trackers&quot; was filmed in this facility in 1993, with the radio telescopes being prominently featured.

=== Space tracking ===
Whilst remaining a telescope predominantly dedicated to radio-astronomy, in 2007, the Compact Array was outfitted with receivers enabling it to receive radio waves 7 mm long, allowing it to be used from time to time to help NASA track spacecraft.

==Key results==
Highlights of the scientific work done by the ATCA include:
:1991 the first image of a radio supernova remnant as it formed (SNR 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud)
:1992 observe the longest galactic radio jets to date (galaxy 0319-453).
:1995 create the first 3-D models of Jupiter’s radiation belts, showing properties of its magnetic field closer to the planet than spacecraft could measure.
:1996 create the most detailed maps of hydrogen in the Magellanic Clouds, by a factor of 20.
:1998 first evidence that gamma-ray bursts are linked to supernovae.
:2000 observations suggest that radio beams from the giant radio galaxy B0114-476 may have turned off, then restarted.
:2001 observations suggest that Abell 3667, a cluster of about 500 galaxies, was produced by two smaller clusters merging. This is the first observational evidence for this process.
:2001 (with Parkes telescope) the first three-dimensional structure of a face-on galaxy (the Large Magellanic Cloud).
:2002 (with Chandra X-ray space telescope) for the first time capture the entire life-cycle of jets from a microquasar, XTE J1550-564, seeing jets erupt at relativistic speeds, slow down and fade away.
:2003 show that gamma ray bursts release similar total energy, and so probably have a common origin.
:2004 first observations of a neutron star emit a jet at relativistic speed. This challenged the idea that only black holes can create the conditions needed to accelerate jets to such extreme speeds.

<text>The Colt Python is a double action/single action revolver chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge. It was first introduced in 1955 by the Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company. 

Pythons have a reputation for accuracy, smooth trigger pull, and a tight cylinder lock-up. Pythons, built on Colt&#x27;s large I-frame, are similar in size and function to the Colt Trooper and Colt Lawman revolvers.

The Colt Python is intended for the premium revolver market segment. Produced from 1955 to 2005, and again since 2020, it was described by historian R.L. Wilson as &quot;the Rolls-Royce of Colt revolvers&quot;, and firearms historian Ian V. Hogg referred to it as the &quot;best revolver in the world.&quot; Some firearm collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper and Ian V. Hogg have described the Python as &quot;the finest production revolver ever made&quot;.

==History==

===Development and design===
The Colt Python did not have an intensive development program, it was essentially gunsmiths on the production floor trying to come up with a match revolver using mostly existing pieces and parts, and what they created was one of the &quot;finest-looking handguns ever made&quot; according to Keefe.

Al De John, who started with Colt in 1946 as a gunsmith, worked with factory superintendent Al Gunther. De John started to tinker with the .38 Special Officer&#x27;s Model Match beefing up the cylinder, frame, and top-strap due to problems with blowback and firing pins from the excessive pressure from the .357 Magnum hammering the recoil plate. The recoil plate, a separate piece set into the frame, was eliminated by putting the firing-pin hole directly into the frame and making the top strap and crane more robust. Al Gunther first suggested having the iconic vent rib across the barrel. The Python snake name for the revolver came from Colt sticking to their reptilian revolver naming, following the 1950 .38 Special &quot;Cobra&quot;. Thus the &quot;Python&quot; was the second snake moniker for Colt&#x27;s lineup. The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955 as Colt&#x27;s top-of-the-line model and was originally intended to be a large-frame .38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Colt revolver cylinders rotate clockwise compared to counter-clockwise of other revolvers (like Smith &amp; Wesson or Ruger). When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up for the duration of the hammer strike. As the trigger is pressed, the cylinder moves into lockup by the hand, and it is locked tightly. The Colt is locked up tight when the hammer falls. Colt claims that since the cylinder rotates to the right, this forces the cylinder into the frame, opposite of the Smith &amp; Wesson. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity.

===Production of Generation 1 (1955–2005)===
Colt originally manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. It was initially released with a 6&quot; barrel, then a 4&quot; barrel, and finally a 2.5&quot; barrel which was the shortest barrel that could accommodate the vent on the rib. The Python was the first time Colt used the Royal Blue finish, coming from a very high polish on the gun and then bluing. Initially, only Colt gunsmith Al De John and Don Bedford were the only two gunsmiths allowed to work on the Pythons. This gunsmithing included intricate hand fitting and polishing and each revolver would take Colt gunsmiths a little longer; about 20 minutes of labor, compared to the 15 minutes (4 guns per hour) of other Colt revolvers. The Python was initially priced at $125, the same as the reintroduced Single Action Army. Only one Python was built in 1955, a little over 300 Pythons were built by the end of 1956, and more than 100,000 Pythons were built by 1969. From the 1970s each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser; the first mass-produced revolver for which this was done.

===End of Generation 1 (2005)===
In October 1999, Colt announced that it would cease production of Python revolvers. In a 2000 follow-up letter to distributors, the company cited changing market conditions and the costs of defending lawsuits as the reasons to discontinue the Python line, as well as a number of other models. The Colt Custom Gun Shop continued making a limited number of Pythons on special order until 2005, when this limited production ceased. First generation Colt Pythons had a higher cost due to the &quot;hand fitting&quot; by gunsmith specialists that were required due the variations that came from that era&#x27;s limited capabilities with regards to the mass production and machining of precision steel parts. This required expensive gunsmith specialists to file and hand fit parts together, contributing to high labor costs. The 2020 reintroduction of the Colt Python was partially made possible with the increased precision of machining and improvements of tolerances and strength of metal injection molding, negating the need for &quot;hand fitting&quot; by expensive specialists.

===Generation 2 (2020–present)===

The second generation Colt Python was officially released by Colt in January 2020. The new second generation Pythons were strengthened and made to be more robust by being built out of stronger stainless steel than the first generation, increasing the steel mass of the backstrap, and thirty percent more steel beneath the rear adjustable sight. When Colts were first introduced, they were initially designed to shoot bullseye matches, and during the 1950s and 60&#x27;s most shooters were using light .38 Specials for their matches. But as the Pythons became more widely adopted with law enforcement and shooters who ran their guns with higher powered .357 Magnum rounds, Pythons gained a reputation for being fragile when subjected to hard use with magnum loads. So for the second generation Colts, engineers redesigned the rear sight which allowed them to add 30 percent more steel above the cylinder in the top strap. Furthermore, the steel used in the second generation benefits of stronger modern metallurgy. The 410-series stainless steel Colt has used in Pythons since 1983 has been replaced with a stronger more corrosion resistant alloy. It is available with a , or barrel. The Colt Python is powered by a V-spring versus the Smith &amp; Wesson’s leaf spring. Since the 2020-update, the V-spring has been redesigned into a &quot;U&quot; shape, in addition to simplifying and subtracting parts from the lockwork, to prevent &quot;stacking&quot;, a phenomenon where the weight of pull sharply increases at the end of the trigger&#x27;s travel. All new production Pythons are shipped with Altamont wood grips.

==Usage==
The Python has been extremely popular with both target shooters and law enforcement. 

===Law enforcement===
The Python immediately made inroads into the law enforcement market when introduced, with the 6-inch barrel being popular with uniformed officers and the 4-inch barrel considered optimal for plainclothes use. The Colorado State Patrol issued 4-inch blue Pythons until their switch to the S&amp;W .40 caliber autoloader. Georgia State Patrol issued Pythons in the 1980s until their transition to Glock semiautomatic pistols in the 1990s. Florida Highway Patrol issued Pythons to their officers in the 1980s until their transition to the Beretta 92FS in the late 1980s. Python has since fallen out of common use, along with all revolvers, due to changing law enforcement needs that favor semi-automatic pistols. When law-enforcement agencies realized that the 9mm semi-automatic pistols fire a round with similar characteristics to the .38 Special with higher capacity, they began a migration to these, and other, semi-automatic pistol cartridges. The move away from the Python is also being driven by the increasing number of law enforcement agencies which require officers to carry department-issue weapons (as a way to reduce liability).

===Crime===
A Python, loaded with semiwadcutter bullets, was used to murder Irish crime reporter Veronica Guerin in 1996, an act which resulted in the creation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.

===Media===
The Colt Python was featured prominently on the AMC horror drama, The Walking Dead, being carried by its main protagonist, Rick Grimes, during its 11 seasons from 2010 to 2022, leading to a large increase in market demand which assisted in the reintroduction in 2020. It has been featured in many TV series, movies, comics, and video games including The X Files, Burn Notice, Hawaii Five-O, Starsky and Hutch, City Hunter, John Wick, American Gangster, Fight Club, and King Kong.

===Famous===
According to Colt historian, R. L. Wilson, Colt Pythons have been collected by Elvis Presley and various kings: &quot;H.M. (His Majesty) Hussein I of Jordan ordered a limited number of Pythons with 4-inch and 6-inch barrels, as gifts to friends. Casing and barrel were embossed with His Majesty&#x27;s crest. The Python for King Juan Carlos of Spain bore his name in flush gold on the sideplate. Among other celebrated recipients: King Khalid and Prince Fahd (Saudi Arabia), King Hassan (Morocco), Sheik Zayed (United Arab Emirates), President Anwar Sadat (Egypt) and President Hafez Assad (Syria).&quot;

==Models and variants==

The Colt Python featured a fully adjustable white-outline Accro rear sight and a front ramp with red inset. A wide spur, checkered hammer and grooved, curved trigger. Initially only a blued finish was offered, it was the first time Colt produced the Royal Blue finish. Soon after the introduction, a nickel finish was added, and together with Royal Blue, these were the two factory finishes. Initially made only with a barrel, a compact came afterward. Between 1955 and 1994, a downsized barrel version was introduced which still sported full-sized grips. Colt also produced a few short runs of revolvers with a barrel known to collectors as &quot;Combat Pythons.&quot;

In 1980, an barrel Python was introduced chambered for the .38 Special. The Colt Python Target .38 Special was made in Royal Blue and only 251 Colt Python Targets were given the nickel finish. Also the Colt Python Hunter was unveiled, which was the 8-inch Python with Pachmayr grips, factory-mounted 2X Leupold scope on the barrel with Redfield mounts, and packaged in a Haliburton case that included a Colt-marked plastic ammunition box, wood handle cleaning rod and tool kit. The Colt Python Hunter was the first field-ready handgun hunting package made by a major handgun manufacturer. It was discontinued by 1990 and briefly offered as a Colt Custom Shop model afterward. 

In 1981, Coltguard, a proprietary electroless weather-resistant plating, was also made available. The stainless Python was reintroduced in 1984, followed in 1985 by the super-polished stainless Ultimate Python, which was fitted with an Elliason target front sight. In 1988 only 200 Colt Python Stalker were produced in stainless steel. It has an 8-inch vented ribbed barrel, a smooth non-fluted cylinder, a Leupold M8-2x Extended E.R. scope, and rubber grips with the Colt Medallion. A small number of Pythons were gold and silver plated for various commemoratives and special orders throughout the years.

In 1982, the Colt Python Silhouette came with a rib-mounted Leupold scope and Pachmayr grips, and housed in a black fitted-case with nickel trim. There was also an 8-inch Ten Pointer Series with a 3X Burris scope, wooden grips, an extra set of neoprene composition grips and a carrying case.

Two Colt revolver variants using Python barrels but not Python frames or internals were made in small numbers by Colt. The first was the Colt Boa of 1985, a limited production run of 1,200 .357 Magnum revolvers, made for the Lew Horton Distributing Company in Massachusetts. It uses a Python barrel mated to a Trooper Mk V frame. Six hundred 6-inch revolvers and six hundred 4-inch revolvers were made, of which one hundred were matched sets. Though it resembles a Python visually, it is substantially different internally.

The second was the stainless steel Colt Grizzly of 1994, another limited-production .357 Magnum revolver. It uses a Python barrel mated to a Colt King Cobra frame. Five hundred of these revolvers were manufactured, with six-inch Magna-ported barrels and smooth, unfluted cylinders. The ported barrel includes a bear footprint. Similar to the Grizzly was the Colt Kodiak, which was a Colt Anaconda with a Magna-ported barrel and an unfluted cylinder. Approximately 2,000 Kodiaks were manufactured. All original Colt Pythons use the original Colt E/I frame type mechanics with a leaf hammer spring design in common with earlier Colt models, including the postwar Colt .357 Magnum model and the pre-war Colt Official Police and Army Special models. As described above, the Boa and Grizzly are structurally part of the Mk.III/Mk.V revolver product lines which use the much later J and V designated frames. These various hybrids are very collectible due to low production quantities, but because they are a completely different revolver action based upon the later coil-mainspring Colt products, they may not be considered Pythons.

In 1997 manufacture of the Python was switched from the main assembly line to the Colt Custom Shop, and the gun was offered in both highly polished and matte stainless steel and renamed the Colt Python Elite. It remained in limited production, off and on, until 2004.

In 2020, Colt reintroduced the Python in barrels, followed by a version in 2022. The reintroduced Python has been technically revised and reinforced compared to the original revolver. Of the first issues, the 6-inch is generally the most common, the 8-inch was intended for hunting, the 4-inch was preferred by plain-clothes police, the 2.5-inch and 3-inch were limited and have become rare.

With the production return in January 2020, Colt sanctioned and authenticated the first engraved new production Colt Python. It was made by Tyler Gun Works and sold for $18,026 via auction on GunBroker.com on February 27, 2020. The proceeds were donated to the NRA Whittington Center Adventure Camp.

==Issues==
With the re-introduction of the new 2020-era Colt Python, whenever examining issues of a Colt Python it is necessary to first determine whether the inquiry is in regard to the first generation 1955–2005 Python model or the redesigned second generation 2020-era Python with improved internals and upgraded robustness. 

A downside to the older generation Colt Python&#x27;s precision as a tendency to go &quot;out of time&quot; with continued heavy shooting. Going &quot;out of time&quot; or mis-timing on a revolver is a condition in which the hand does not move each and every cylinder chamber to the exact correct rotation with respect to the forcing cone. Furthermore, any revolver used for many thousands of rounds may eventually require the same timing adjustments. In any case, the first and most common symptom of typical timing issues will be only a slight loss of accuracy, which on a Python may not even be noticeable to many shooters. Colt beefed up the robustness by increasing the quality of the steel, hardness of the parts, and the amount of steel for the 2020 release of the second generation Pythons.

Stacking, a phenomenon where the weight of pull sharply increases at the end of the trigger&#x27;s travel, was an issue for the first generation Pythons. For the 2020 release of the second generation Pythons, Colt redesigned the lockwork, simplifying and subtracting parts, and redesigning the V-spring into a &quot;U&quot; shape where &#x27;stacking&#x27; is no longer an issue.
Author Martin Dougherty notes the weight of the Python as a drawback, as it is quite heavy for a handgun of its caliber, ranging from 2.4 lbs (1.1 kg) to 2.6 lbs (1.2 kg). This makes the Python comparable to Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s premier .357, the M27, which weighs with a barrel. Both revolvers are lighter than Smith and Wesson&#x27;s more powerful M29 .44 Magnum, which weighs in barrel configuration.

<doc id="639896" wikidata="Q194675" url="?curid=639896" title="Linnaeus's mouse opossum">
<text>Linnaeus&#x27;s mouse opossum (Marmosa murina), also known as the common or murine mouse opossum, is a South American marsupial of the family Didelphidae.

==Range and habitat==
Its range includes Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, and eastern Bolivia.

This opossum is most commonly sighted near forest streams and human habitation. A nocturnal creature, it shelters during the day in a mesh of twigs on a tree branch, a tree hole, or an old bird&#x27;s nest.

==Behavior==
It eats insects, spiders, lizards, bird&#x27;s eggs, chicks, and fruits.

Linnaeus&#x27;s mouse opossum has a gestation period of approximately 13 days, and gives birth to 5–10 young.

The mouse opossum will &quot;play dead&quot; if it thinks that it is in danger, it will even smell as if it were dead.

==Description==
It is pale beige to grey on its underparts with short, smooth fur. Its face appears to have a black mask on it, its eyes are prominent, and its ears are very upright. Its tail, which females use to carry leaves, is much longer than the rest of its body.

Linnaeus&#x27;s mouse opossum has a body length of approximately , with a tail of approximately long. It weighs about .

<doc id="639899" wikidata="Q1139110" url="?curid=639899" title="Ellsworth Mountains">
<text>The Ellsworth Mountains are the highest mountain ranges in Antarctica, forming a long and wide chain of mountains in a north to south configuration on the western margin of the Ronne Ice Shelf in Marie Byrd Land. They are bisected by Minnesota Glacier to form the Sentinel Range to the north and the Heritage Range to the south. The former is by far the higher and more spectacular with Mount Vinson () constituting the highest point on the continent. The mountains are located within the Chilean Antarctic territorial claim but outside of the Argentinian and British ones.

==Discovery==
The mountains were discovered on November 23, 1935, by the American explorer Lincoln Ellsworth in the course of a trans-Antarctic flight from Dundee Island to the Ross Ice Shelf. He gave them the descriptive name Sentinel Range.

The mountains were mapped in detail by the U.S. Geological Survey from ground surveys and U.S. Navy aerial photography, 1958–1966. When it became evident that the mountains comprise two distinct ranges, the US-ACAN restricted the application of Sentinel Range to the high northern one and gave the name Heritage Range to the southern one; the Committee recommended the name of the discoverer for this entire group of mountains.

==Geology==

Geologically, the Ellsworth Mountains occupy a discrete block of continental crust known as the Ellsworth-Whitmore Mountain terrane. This terrane was part of the early Paleozoic amalgamation of Gondwana and consists of a thick section of folded Cambrian–Permian strata, which accumulated on Grenville-age continental crust. It was likely once part of the Cape Fold Belt that was detached from southern Africa during the breakup of Gondwana and later incorporated into Antarctica.

The stratigraphy consists of the thick Early Cambrian-Middle Cambrian Heritage Group overlain by the thick Late Cambrian-Devonian Crashsite Group; the thick Permo-Carboniferous Whiteout Conglomerate (black diamictite) from Gondawanaland glaciation; and the thick Permian Polarstar Formation consisting of black argillite, siltstone, sandstone, and coal. Within the Heritage Group is the Union Glacier Formation of ashflow tuff-lahar deposits, the Hyde Glacier Formation of graywacke-argillite-conglomerate, the Drake Icefall Formation of black shales and marble, the Conglomerate Ridge Formation of conglomerate and quartzite, the Liberty Hills-Springer Peak-Frazier Ridge Formations of quartzite-argillite, and the Minaret Formation of marble. Within the Crashsite Group is the Howard Nunataks Formation of quartzites, the Mt. Liptak Formation of quartzites, and the Mount Wyatt Earp Formation of quartzites. Major deformation of the sedimentary rocks occurred during the Gondwanide orogeny, followed by later uplift.

==Climate==
The temperatures in the Ellsworth Mountains average around -30 °C (-20 °F). The best time for expeditions are November through January, mid-summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Arranging an outing here is a difficult task, requiring either official scientific sponsorship or considerable financial resources.

<doc id="639900" wikidata="Q3044693" url="?curid=639900" title="Silent Generation">
<text>The Silent Generation, also known as the Traditionalist Generation, is the Western demographic cohort following the Greatest Generation and preceding the baby boomers. The generation is generally defined as people born from 1928 to 1945. By this definition and U.S. Census data, there were 23 million Silents in the United States as of 2019.

In the United States, the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II in the early-to-mid 1940s caused people to have fewer children and as a result, the generation is comparatively small. It includes most of those who fought during the Korean War. Upon coming of age in the postwar era, Silents were sometimes characterized as trending towards conformity and traditionalism, as well as comprising the &quot;silent majority&quot;. However, they have also been noted as forming the leadership of the civil rights movement and the 1960s counterculture, and creating the rock and roll music of the 1950s and 1960s.

In the United Kingdom, the Silent Generation was also born during a period of relatively low birthrates for similar reasons to the United States and was quite traditional upon coming of age. They lived through times of prosperity as young adults, economic upheaval in middle age, and relative comfort in later life. The Sixtiers is a similar age group in the Soviet Union whose upbringings were also heavily influenced by the troubles of the mid-20th century. The term &quot;the builders&quot; has been used to describe a similar cohort in Australia. Most people of the Silent Generation are the parents of Baby Boomers and older Generation Xers. Their own parents most commonly belonged to either the Greatest Generation or the Lost Generation.

==Terminology==
&quot;Time&quot; magazine first used the term &quot;Silent Generation&quot; in a November 5, 1951, article titled &quot;The Younger Generation&quot;, although the term appears to precede the publication:

The &quot;Time&quot; article used birth dates of 1923 to 1933 for the generation, but the term somehow migrated to the later years currently in use. A reason later proposed for this perceived silence is that as young adults during the McCarthy Era, many members of the Silent Generation felt it was unwise to speak out.

The term &quot;Silent Generation&quot; is also used to describe a similar age group in the UK but has been at times described as a reference to strict childhood discipline which taught children to be &quot;seen but not heard.&quot; In Canada, it has been used with the same meaning as in the United States. The cohort is also known as the &quot;Traditionalist Generation&quot;.

==Dates and age range definitions==
The Pew Research Center uses 1928 to 1945 as birth years for this cohort. According to this definition, people of the Silent Generation are to years old in .

The Intergenerational Centre of the Resolution Foundation has used 1926 to 1945, while the &quot;Encyclopedia of Strategic Leadership and Management&quot; uses the range 1925 to 1945. This generation had reached maturity as early as 1946 and as late as 1963, but the majority of Silents had become of age in the 1950s, in the wake of the Civil rights movement, which was followed by older boomers in the 1960s. Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe use 1925 to 1942. People born in the later years of World War II who were too young to have any direct recollections of the conflict are sometimes considered to be cultural, if not demographically, baby boomers.

==Characteristics==

===Australia===
Australia&#x27;s McCrindle Research uses the name &quot;Builders&quot; to describe the Australian members of this generation, born between 1925 and 1945, and coming of age to become the generation &quot;who literally and metaphorically built [the] nation after the austerity years post-Depression and World War II&quot;.

===Soviet Union===

The Silent Generation in the Soviet Union is similar to Sixtiers. These people were born into Stalinism, raised during collectivization, and were witnesses of the Holodomor. So even though there was no Great Depression in the Soviet Union, they still experienced a lack of resources and food as children. In the 1930s and 1940s many of them lost their parents or close relatives during Stalinist repressions and later during battles and German occupation in WWII. Sometimes this generation is called the &quot;Children of XX-th Congress&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
====Childhood and youth====

There was a slump in birth rates in the UK between the two major baby booms following each world war. This roughly correlated with the economic downturn in the 1930s and World War II. The era of the Great Depression was a time of deprivation for many children, unemployment was high and slum housing was common. However, education was compulsory from the age of five to fourteen years old. Gaining a place at grammar school was a way for young people whose families could not afford them to be privately educated to gain full access to secondary schooling. In a time before widespread car use, children commonly played outside in the street and further afield without adult supervision. Toys of this era were quite simple but examples included dolls, model aeroplanes, and trains. Other popular activities included reading comics, playing board games, going to the cinema, and joining children&#x27;s organizations such as the scouts. It was estimated that more than 85% of British households owned a wireless (radio) by 1939.

The Second World War impacted the lives of children in various ways. Significant numbers of schoolchildren were evacuated without their parents to the countryside to avoid the threat of bombing throughout the war years. The quality of education fell everywhere but particularly in urban areas for various reasons, including a shortage of teachers and supplies, the distress pupils suffered from air raids and the disruption caused by evacuations. The degree of supervision children received also fell as fathers left to fight and mothers joined the workforce. However, rationing during World War II and the years after improved the health of the population overall with one study conducted in the early 2000s suggesting that a typical 1940s child ate a healthier diet than their counterpart at the start of the 21st century. Following the Second World War, the school-leaving age was raised to 15 with every child being allocated to one of three types of school based on a test taken at the age of 11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (selection between two types of school took place at age 12 in Scotland).
The years after the Second World War saw a continuation of difficult social conditions; there was a serious housing shortage and rationing was at times more restrictive than it had been during the war. The late 1940s saw substantial social reforms and changes to the structure of the British economy. Economic conditions and living standards improved significantly during the 1950s and 60s. Unemployment rested at roughly two percent during this period, much lower than it had been during the depression or would be later in the 20th century. Consumer goods such as televisions and household labour saving devices became increasingly common. By the late 1950s, Britain was one of the most affluent societies anywhere in the world. In 1957, 52% of the British population described themselves as &quot;very happy&quot; in comparison to 36% in 2005. That year, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan famously said:

The idea of the &quot;teenager&quot; as a distinctive phase of life associated with rebellion against adult authority and older generations social norms became increasingly prominent in public discourse during the 1940s and 50s. Though in many ways those reaching maturity in the years after the Second World War were quite traditionally conservative in experience and attitudes. National service (military conscription) was reintroduced after the war and continued throughout the 1950s. Young people would often attend ballroom dances to socialise and find potential romantic partners. The average age of first marriage in England and Wales fell reaching its lowest level in more than a hundred years by the late 1960s of 27.2 and 24.7 years for men and women respectively. Cultural norms and government policy encouraged marriage and women to focus on their role as homemaker, wife and mother whilst their husband acted as the household&#x27;s primary breadwinner. The treatment of those who did not meet society&#x27;s expectations in their personal lives was often quite unsympathetic. Abortion and homosexuality were illegal whilst later investigations suggest that many women who gave birth out of wedlock had their babies forcibly removed from them. Laws were liberalised significantly in the late 1960s, but change was slower in certain areas in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

====Mid and later life====
Heavy industry had been troubled in the UK throughout the 1960s, this combined with a global energy crisis and influx of cheap goods from Asia led to rapid deindustrialisation by the mid 1970s. New jobs were either low wage or too high-skilled for those laid off. This situation led to significant political instability and industrial unrest causing a great deal of frustration and inconvenience to the general public. Meanwhile, another set of problems was developing in Northern Ireland where politics had become increasingly tense and divided during the 1960s. This developed into a sectarian conflict with the British Army involved known as The Troubles which continued over several decades. This conflict caused more than 3,500 deaths. In 1979, Margaret Thatcher became prime minister and brought about the end to some aspects of the Post-war consensus on economic policy. For instance, her government created the right-to-buy scheme which allowed renters to buy up their council homes at a reduced prices. Middle aged people were one of the social groups which particularly benefited from this policy. Her policies have been described as giving millions of people direct ownership of capital through share or house ownership but have also been associated with high unemployment, rising poverty and social unrest.
For several decades prior to 2010, women received the State Pension from the age of 60 and men from the age of 65. A 2019 report stated that Pensioner Poverty in the UK had increased rapidly during the 1970s and the 1980s but fell in the 1990s and early 21st century. According to the report 20% of the silent generation, which it described as individuals born from 1926 to 1945, had lived in poverty at the age of 70 in comparison to 45% of the Greatest Generation and 15% of Baby Boomers at similar ages. The report attributed the change to more private pensions, increased home ownership and government policy. Commentators suggested that older people were somewhat insulated from the effects of the austerity programme in the 2010s. Though pensioner poverty was rising slightly by the mid to late 2010s and early 2020s, especially among women. The average life expectancy was around 80 years old, a few years older for women than men, in the late 2000s and 2010s.

====General trends====
An analysis of British Election Study surveys for the 1964 to 2019 general elections suggested that the Silent Generation as a cohort became more likely to vote for the Conservative Party as they grew older. The results suggested that at 35 years old, people born from 1928 to 1945 were about 5 percentage points less likely to vote Conservative than the national average, but that by the time they were 70 years old, they were about ten percentage points more likely to do so than the national average. They were, however, by the end of the time period studied, less likely to vote for the Conservatives than the next youngest age group, baby boomers. An article on the analysis commented that it is conventional wisdom that people become more conservative as they get older but that isn&#x27;t true of all the age groups the analysis covered and environmental factors are also important in influencing the development of voter behavior.

===United States===
====As children and adolescents====

As a cultural narrative, the Silent Generation are described as children of the Great Depression whose parents, having revelled in the highs of the Roaring Twenties, now faced great economic hardship and struggled to provide for their families. Before reaching their teens, they shared with their parents the horrors of World War II but through children&#x27;s eyes. Many lost their fathers or older siblings who were killed in the war. They saw the fall of Nazism and the catastrophic devastation made capable of the nuclear bomb. When the Silent Generation began coming of age after World War II, they were faced with a devastated social order within which they would spend their early adulthood and a new enemy in Communism via the betrayal of post-war agreements and rise of the Soviet Union. Unlike the previous generation who had fought for &quot;changing the system,&quot; the Silent Generation was about &quot;working within the system.&quot; They did this by keeping their heads down and working hard, thus earning themselves the &quot;silent&quot; label. Their attitudes leaned toward not being risk-takers and playing it safe. &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s story on the College Class of &#x27;49 was subtitled &quot;Taking No Chances&quot;. This generation was also heavily influenced by the transformations brought about by the Golden Age of Radio, the rise of trade unions, the development of transatlantic flight and the discovery of penicillin during their formative years.

====In adulthood====

From their childhood experiences during the Depression and the example of frugality set by their parents, Silents tended to be thrifty and even miserly, preferring to maximize a product&#x27;s lifespan, i.e., &quot;get their money&#x27;s worth.&quot; This led some members of the Silent Generation to develop hoarding behaviors in the guise of &quot;not being wasteful.&quot;

As with their own parents, Silents tended to marry and have children young. American Silents are noted as being the youngest of all American generations in the age of marriage and parenthood. As young parents, the older members of this generation primarily produced the later Baby Boomers, while younger members of the generation and older members who held off raising a family until later in life gave birth to Generation X. Whereas divorce in the eyes of the previous generation was considered aberrant behavior, the Silents were the generation that reformed marriage laws to allow for divorce and lessen the stigma. This led to a historically unprecedented wave of divorces among Silent Generation couples in the United States.

Critics of the theory that Silents tend towards conformity and playing it safe note that, at least in the United States, leaders of 1960s-era rebellion/innovation/protest such as Muhammad Ali, Bob Dylan, Noam Chomsky, Martin Luther King Jr., and Jimi Hendrix were members of the Silent Generation, and not Baby Boomers, for whom these figures were heroes, although the majority of their followers were Boomers. While seven Presidents of the United States were members of the Greatest Generation (John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush); four presidents have been Baby Boomers (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump); two presidents were members of the Lost Generation (Harry S. Truman; and Dwight D. Eisenhower), only one President, Joe Biden, has been a member of the Silent Generation.

As a birth cohort, Silents never rose in protest as a unified political entity. Widely seen as &quot;following the rules&quot; and benefiting from stable wealth creation, their Boomer and Gen X children would become estranged from them due to their different views regarding social issues of the day and their relatively decreased economic opportunity, creating a different generational zeitgeist. For example, the Boomer children were instrumental in bringing about the counterculture of the 1960s, and the rise of left wing, liberal views considered anti-establishment, which went directly against the &quot;work within the system&quot; approach that many Silents had practiced. Gen X children grew up in the 1970s and 1980s with the threat of nuclear annihilation hanging over them and a resultant bleak view of the future, contributing to their generational disaffection, in contrast to the optimistic outlook of their Silent Generation parents.

The style of parenting from the Lost Generation or the Interbellum Generation (older members of the Greatest Generation), was known to the Silents and the generations before them originated in the late 1800s, when the Lost Gens were Children or Teenagers. Representative of this was the idea that &quot;children should be seen but not heard&quot;. These ideas were ultimately challenged following the 1946 publication of the book &quot;The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care&quot; by Benjamin Spock, which influenced some Boomers&#x27; views on parenting and family values when they became parents themselves. The book also influenced how Baby Boomers were parented. These less-restrictive behavioral standards, seen as overly permissive by the Silents, further estranged those Boomers from their parents and, among other things, gave rise in the 1970s to the term generation gap. This was to describe the initial conflict of cultural values between the Silents and their Generation Joneser (younger Baby Boomers) and to a lesser extent, their Generation X children in the 1980s, although it wasn&#x27;t quite as extreme as it was between the Greatest Generation and the &quot;Leading Edge Boomers&quot;, (older Baby Boomers) in the 1960s.

<doc id="639902" wikidata="Q5050861" url="?curid=639902" title="Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament">
<text>In the Parliament of Australia, a casual vacancy arises when a member of either the Senate or the House of Representatives:
* dies
* resigns mid-term
* is expelled from Parliament and their seat is declared vacant,
* is absent from (fails to attend) the house, without the permission of the house, for two consecutive months of a session, or
* is disqualified.

==Disqualification==

The &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot; (text) requires candidates for Parliament to be Australian citizens.

A member will be disqualified if they are found to have been ineligible for election, or become ineligible to sit, because they:
*are a subject or citizen of a foreign power or under an acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power
*are attainted (convicted) of treason
*have been convicted and are under sentence or subject to be sentenced for an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer under a Commonwealth or State law
*are an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent
*hold any office of profit (i.e. income) under the Crown or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any Commonwealth revenues, or
*have any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Commonwealth Public Service in any way other than as a member in common with other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than 25 persons.

A member will also be disqualified if they:
*take the benefit, whether by assignment, composition, or otherwise, of any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors
*directly or indirectly take or agree to take any fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth, or for services rendered in the Parliament to any person or State
*have been convicted of bribery, undue influence or interference with political liberty, or have been found by the Court of Disputed Returns to have committed or attempted to commit bribery or undue influence when a candidate (the disqualification is for two years from the date of the conviction or finding), or
*are of unsound mind.

==Resignation==
A member of the House of Representatives may resign by tendering the resignation to the Speaker, as required by section 37 of the Australian Constitution, or in the absence of the Speaker to the Governor-General. Similarly, a senator would tender the resignation to the President of the Senate or in the absence of the President to the Governor-General, as required by section 19 of the Constitution.

==How a casual vacancy is filled==
Casual vacancies are handled in different ways, depending on the house concerned.

===Senate===

====States====
When a Senate seat representing one of the six states becomes vacant, Section 15 of the Australian Constitution requires the parliament of the relevant state to choose a replacement. This is done in a joint sitting of the upper and lower houses (except for Queensland, which has a unicameral parliament). If the state parliament is not in session, then the governor of the state (acting on the advice of the state&#x27;s executive council) may appoint the replacement, but such an appointment lapses if it is not confirmed by a joint sitting within 14 days after the beginning of the next session of the state parliament.

Prior to 29 July 1977, senators were elected for a six-year term, people appointed to a casual vacancy only held office until the earlier of the next election for the House of Representatives or the Senate, at which the vacancy would be filled by the electors of the relevant state. It was also an established convention, but not a constitutional requirement, that the state parliament choose (or the governor appoint) a replacement from the same political party as their predecessor. It had also been the practice for the relevant party to provide a list of suitable names to the state premier, and for the state parliament to make the choice. Before 1946, the conventions were not as firmly established, with ten casual vacancies being filled by someone from a different party. After 1946, however, they were not breached again until 1975 – twice:

* On 9 February 1975, the New South Wales Labor Senator Lionel Murphy resigned from the Senate to take up an appointment as a judge of the High Court of Australia. On 27 February, the NSW Liberal Premier Tom Lewis appointed Cleaver Bunton, a former long-serving Mayor of Albury, who was not affiliated with any political party. Bunton sat as an independent senator.
* On 30 June 1975, the Queensland Labor Senator Bertie Milliner died suddenly. The Labor Party gave only one replacement name to the Country Party Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen - that of Mal Colston. However, on 3 September, at Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s instigation, the Parliament of Queensland appointed Albert Field to the vacancy. Although he had been a member of the Labor Party for 30 years, Field was now openly critical of the Labor government of Gough Whitlam, and he was immediately expelled from the party for accepting the appointment. Field took his seat in the Senate as an independent. However, there were doubts as to his constitutional eligibility to sit at all. Although he had resigned from the Queensland Department of Education the day before he was appointed, the Education Act (Qld) required three weeks&#x27; notice of resignation, and it was arguable that he was therefore still in Crown service (this technicality had been ignored many times in the past). The Labor Party immediately challenged Field&#x27;s appointment in the High Court, and he was on leave from the Senate from 1 October for the remainder of his short-lived term, which ended when the parliament was dissolved on 11 November.

On 21 May 1977, a referendum was held on the question of whether Section 15 of the Constitution should be changed to require future Senate casual vacancies to be filled by a member of the party represented by the former senator at the time of their election, if the state parliament chooses to fill the vacancy, and the new senator&#x27;s term continues until the end of the original senator&#x27;s term. The referendum was passed and came into effect on 29 July 1977. Where a senator had been elected representing a certain party, and changed allegiances to a different party mid-term, and then died or resigned, the replacement senator would be a person representing the first party. This was first implemented when South Australia Senator Steele Hall, who at the time of his election represented the Liberal Movement but had later changed to the Liberal Party of Australia, resigned and was replaced by Janine Haines. She represented the Australian Democrats and was chosen because the Liberal Movement had merged with the Democrats.

Despite the constitutional change, a party&#x27;s nomination to replace the casual vacancy does not guarantee that the nominee will be appointed to the Senate by the state parliament. Even when there is only a single nominee, there must be a vote to approve the appointment. This means that if the state parliament votes against the nominee, the vacancy is not filled. This was demonstrated when Labor&#x27;s Don Grimes resigned from the Senate in April 1987. A vote to appoint Labor&#x27;s nominee John Devereux was undertaken by a joint sitting of the Tasmanian Parliament on 8 May 1987, which resulted in a tied vote. Under Tasmanian Parliament&#x27;s rules adopted for joint sittings, &quot;if the votes are equal, the Question shall be resolved in the Negative&quot;. Therefore the tied vote rejected Devereux&#x27;s nomination to the Senate. Ray Groom, a Tasmanian Liberal minister, argued: &quot;section 15 of the Constitution clearly states that it is for the Parliament to choose the person to fill the vacancy and not the party. we can choose only a person who is a member of the same party ... but we are not bound to accept the nomination of the party concerned&quot;. The move by the Liberal state government was criticised by federal Liberal leader John Howard for &quot;voting against established convention and the intent of the Constitutional change&quot;. The joint sitting to appoint another replacement was adjourned but ultimately did not take place, as the Senate was dissolved on 5 June for a double dissolution election in July and therefore a replacement was no longer required.

When a vacancy exists in the Senate as a result of the ineligibility of a person to be elected, as in the 2017 dual citizenship cases, the seat of the disqualified Senator is filled by a countback of the previous Senate election results in the affected State, as was the method used in &quot;Re Culleton (No 2)&quot; and in the &quot;Re Day (No 2)&quot;.

A vacancy may also exist when a Senator resigns or dies after they were re-elected to the Senate but before the start of the next Senate term. This means a vacancy is created in both the current term and the following term that has not yet commenced, creating a constitutional quirk. This happened for the first time on 24 October 2013, a month after the 2013 federal election, when New South Wales Labor Senator Bob Carr resigned from the Senate. Carr&#x27;s current term was to expire on 30 June 2014, and he was already re-elected to the Senate in the election for the following term starting 1 July 2014. Deborah O&#x27;Neill was selected by Labor to fill the casual vacancy, and was appointed by the NSW Parliament on 13 November 2013. In an unprecedented situation where Carr resigned both his current term and the following term, the NSW Government sought legal advice from the Crown Solicitor of New South Wales regarding the tenure of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s appointment. The Crown Solicitor&#x27;s advice was that the NSW Parliament could only fill the &quot;current&quot; vacancy, and would have to wait until July 2014 (start of the new term) to fill the &quot;future&quot; vacancy. Initially, there were no planned sitting days between July and mid-August 2014, however, a reduced joint sitting of 13 lower house MPs and over 40 Legislative Councillors was held on 2 July 2014 to reappoint O&#x27;Neill to the Senate for the new term.

====Territories====
When a Senate seat representing the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) or the Northern Territory (NT) becomes vacant, the replacement senator is chosen by the ACT Legislative Assembly or the NT Legislative Assembly, under section 44 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Text). This process was used in NT for the first and only time on 16 June 1998, when Trish Crossin was chosen by the NT Legislative Assembly to replace Bob Collins, who had resigned from the Senate on 30 March. In the ACT, the process was used for the first time on 18 February 2003, when Gary Humphries was chosen by the ACT Legislative Assembly to replace Margaret Reid, who had resigned from the Senate on 14 February.

If the Assembly is not in session, then the Administrator of the NT (acting on the advice of the territory&#x27;s executive council) or the Chief Minister of the ACT may appoint the replacement, but such an appointment lapses if it is not confirmed within 14 days after the beginning of the next session of the territory assembly. This procedure is very similar to the procedure for states, albeit under a different legislation or legal document.

Prior to 1989, different processes were used to appoint territory senators to casual vacancies. The original Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973 was passed in the 1974 joint sitting and took effect on 7 August 1974, allowing the election of two senators from NT and ACT each. In section 9 of the original act, for NT or ACT casual vacancies, the President of the Senate, or the Governor-General in absence of the President, may issue a writ for the election of a new Senator (i.e. by-election). If there are two casual vacancies in one territory, a writ may be issued for a single election of two new senators. These provisions were in place until 1980, but they never occurred.

The Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973, including Section 9, was amended by the Senate (Representation of Territories) Amendment Act 1980 in May 1980. In the amended Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973, NT casual vacancy replacements were to be chosen by the NT Legislative Assembly, the same way as it is currently. The ACT had not gained self-government yet, so the replacement senator was elected by a joint sitting of both houses of the Federal Parliament. This had occurred twice:
*when Margaret Reid was elected on 5 May 1981 to replace the deceased ACT Senator John Knight
*when Bob McMullan was elected on 16 February 1988 to replace former ACT Senator Susan Ryan, who had resigned.

In February 1984, these provisions were incorporated into the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, as amended by the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation Amendment Act 1983. The ACT gained self-government in 1989, and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was again amended by the A.C.T. Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988 to allow ACT casual vacancy replacements to be chosen by the ACT Legislative Assembly, the same way as it is currently.

In accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the provision of a joint sitting of both houses of the Federal Parliament would still be used to fill a Senate casual vacancy in the representation of any territory other than NT or the ACT, if such a territory ever gained separate Senate representation.

===House of Representatives===
Casual vacancies in the House of Representatives are filled by a by-election. There is no constitutional requirement for a by-election to be held within any particular time, or at all. When a general election is expected within a relatively short time, it has often been the practice not to hold a by-election. This has been justified on the grounds that: (a) the electors of the seat in question should not be burdened with voting twice within a short period of time, when their views are hardly likely to change significantly in that time; and (b) the cost of holding a by-election is considerable, and it is ultimately the taxpayers who bear the cost. For example, the death of three Cabinet ministers in the 1940 Canberra air disaster on 13 August 1940 meant that three by-elections would have been required. However, a general election was already being planned to be held in the coming weeks and the by-elections were therefore not required.

If it is appropriate to hold a by-election, the Speaker consults with the Australian Electoral Commission as to the suitability of various dates, invites comments from the various party leaders about the proposed dates, makes the final choice, and issues the writ. At least 33 days must elapse between the moment the Speaker issues a writ and the date of a by-election, and the Speaker cannot issue the writ until receipt of a formal letter of resignation. A by-election must take place on a Saturday.

If, since the previous general election, there has been a re-distribution that has altered the boundaries of the division in question, then the boundaries as at the original election still apply, but only those electors enrolled for that division at the time of the by-election are permitted, and required, to vote.

<doc id="639905" wikidata="Q16149853" url="?curid=639905" title="Lyon College">
<text>Lyon College is a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church and located in Batesville, Arkansas. Founded in 1872 as Arkansas College, it is the oldest independent college in Arkansas.

==History==
Located in Batesville, Arkansas, the college was founded in 1872 and is the oldest independent college in Arkansas. It was founded by Isaac J. Long who served as its first president. He was succeeded by his son E. R. Long and then by a Mr. Cleland.

 In 1871, state leaders narrowed down choices for the potential flagship location of a state college to either Fayetteville or Batesville. Fayetteville and Washington County residents collaboratively offered financial backing to establish the college in Fayetteville, and Batesville ultimately lost the bid. However, Rev. Isaac J. Long, along with others involved with the Presbyterian church, decided to open a college soon after. They named Arkansas College at Batesville. The charter was signed by Governor Ozra Amander Hadley on October 24, 1872. Morrow Hall was the college&#x27;s first permanent building, occupied in 1873. The Long family led the college until Dr. Paul M. McCain became president of the college in 1952. 

It was renamed Lyon College in 1994, after the Lyon family of Arkansas. Frank Lyon Sr. served on the board of trustees from 1946 to 1988, including as chairman from 1977 to 1987. Frank Lyon Jr. served on the board for more than 30 years, until his death in 2015. He served as chair of the board for four years. Frank Lyon Jr. and Jane Lyon gave the largest gift in the college&#x27;s history of $10 million.

W. Joseph King became president in July 2017.
King succeeded Donald V. Weatherman, who served as president from 2009 until he retired in 2017. Melissa Taverner was named provost in February 2018. After King&#x27;s resignation in 2021, Taverner succeeded him as president.

== Academics ==
Lyon College is classified among &quot;Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts &amp; Sciences Focus&quot;. In 2019, the college was listed at #50 on the &quot;Top Performers of Social Mobility&quot; published by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. As of 2020, Lyon College was ranked #164-#215 among &quot;National Liberal Arts Colleges&quot; &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Campus==
 The college was originally located in the &quot;downtown&quot; block that the First Presbyterian Church of Batesville now occupies. In the 1920s, the college moved to East End Heights neighborhood, which was later known as the middle campus. The college added more buildings from 1991 and 1994, including the Holloway Theatre, Lyon Business and Economics Building, President&#x27;s Residence, Bradley Manor, Upper Division Residence Hall, and Young House. The Derby Center for Science and Mathematics was completed in December 2003, followed by the Kelley Baseball Complex, in January 2004. The size of the current campus is 136 acres.

In October 2010, a fire damaged the Edwards Commons Dining Hall. The building was named after John W. Edwards and Lucille Welman Edwards, who originally funded the building. Reconstruction of the building began in October 2011. Lyon college added two new residence halls, named Whiteside and Wilson, in October 2015.

The campus includes an 18-hole disc golf course that is open to the public.

==Student life==
Student enrollment was 666, as of fall 2024.

Lyon College has a Scottish Heritage program that provides scholarships and hosts the Arkansas Scottish Festival every October. The program also started a campus pipe band that includes Lyon College students, faculty, and staff, along with volunteer musicians from Batesville and surrounding areas. The pipe band has performed locally in Arkansas as well as in Scotland.

The college adopted a pet-friendly policy in January 2018 that allows students to own pets while living in the on-campus dormitories. It began offering obedience classes for animals and animal-friendly facilities, including a coffee shop and a dog park called the Schram Bark Park.

The college has a student-run honor code and a freshman orientation system that runs from before the start of freshman year until the end of the first year.

Lyon College has a fully endowed two-week study abroad program called the Nichols Program.

In 2019, Lyon College initiated an Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) program and Military Science and Leadership concentration. The program is an affiliate of the Arkansas State University ROTC program.

===Former radio station===
From 1976 through 1981, the then-Arkansas College operated a low power &quot;Class D&quot; educational FM radio station, KGED, transmitting on 88.1 MHz. Its studio was in the lower level of the Mabee-Simpson library building and the transmitter was located on the upper level of Brown Chapel, with the broadcast antenna inside the steeple. Broadcasting was sporadic over the years and an attempt was made to revive operations in the fall semester of 1981 by freshman station manager Kevin Manzer. However, operations ceased permanently later that same year when the transmitter failed and was deemed not repairable by the station engineer, Dick Treat.

Lyon College students currently operate KILT, an online radio station, and publish student newspaper The Highlander.

==Athletics==
The Lyon athletic teams are called the Scots. The college is a member of the Division III ranks of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SLIAC) since the 2023–24 academic year; while its football team competes in the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC), beginning the 2024 fall season. The Scots previously competed as an NCAA D-III Independent and in the American Midwest Conference (AMC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) in dual membership during the 2022–23 school year, although they competed in the latter full-time from 2012–13 to 2021–22; in the TranSouth Athletic Conference (TranSouth or TSAC) from 1997–98 to 2011–12; as an NAIA Independent from 1995–96 to 1996–97; and in the defunct Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference (AIC) from about 1980–81 to 1994–95.

Lyon competes in 21 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field, volleyball and wrestling; and co-ed sports include archery, competitive cheer, competitive dance, eSports and shooting sports. Former sports included men&#x27;s lacrosse.

===Wrestling===
In January 2014, the college added men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wrestling to its athletic offerings.

===Football===
Football was added in 2015, which prompted the construction of new residence halls and a 5,500 sq foot field house. The Lyon College football team competed in the Sooner Athletic Conference of the NAIA from the 2018 to 2022 fall seasons.

As of 2024, the Lyon Scots football team competes in the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC).

===Esports===
The college is the only member of National Association of Collegiate Esports in the state of Arkansas. Kevin Jenkins is the athletic director.

===Intramurals===
The college also fields an intramural sports program.

===Move to NCAA Division III===
On February 8, 2022, the school announced that it planned to transition its athletic programs from the NAIA to NCAA Division III, with any conference home yet to be determined.

On August 22, 2022, Lyon received an invitation to join the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SLIAC), starting in the 2023–24 school year.

<text>is a Japanese food company. Founded by Momofuku Ando in 1948 in Izumiōtsu, Osaka, it owns Nissin Food Products, Nissin Chilled Foods, Nissin Frozen Foods, and Myojo Foods. It is known for development of the world&#x27;s first marketed brand of instant noodles Chicken Ramen and products like Cup Noodles, Yakisoba U.F.O., and Demae Iccho.

==History==
===Founding and early years===

The company was founded in Japan on 1 September 1948, by Taiwanese-Japanese immigrant Go Pek-Hok (1910-2007), Japanese name Momofuku Ando as . Ten years later, the company introduced its first instant ramen noodle product, Chikin Ramen (Chicken Ramen). Soon after, the company name was changed to . The company established a US subsidiary, Nissin Foods, in 1970, and began selling instant ramen noodle products under the Japan Instant Noodle Bureau and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries name Top Ramen in 1972. Nissin Chikin Ramen (1958) and Cup Noodles (1971) were both invented by Momofuku Ando. Nissin Foods is headquartered in Yodogawa-ku, Osaka.

===Recent years and expansion===
The company moved to its current headquarters in 1977, when the construction of the building was completed.

In 2007, Myojo Foods Co., Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissin Foods. On January 5, 2007, Nissin founder Momofuku Ando died at the age of 96.

In May 2011, Nissin announced a capital and business alliance with confectionery producer Frente Co., Ltd. In September 2011, the Cup Noodles museum opens in Yokohama, Japan exhibiting the full spectrum of the founder Momofuku Ando&#x27;s vision.

An agreement with Turkey&#x27;s largest consumer goods manufacturing group was reached in September 2013, resulting in the creation of Nissin Yildiz Gida Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S.

March 2014 saw the opening of &quot;The Wave&quot;, a new Japan-based R&amp;D center, aimed at creating &quot;a wave of the most advanced food technologies&quot;. The building has been honored with the Good Design Award.

Worldwide sales of the Cup Noodles reached 40 billion servings in 2016; 70% of total sales were accumulated outside Japan.

==Name==
According to the company, the name &#x27;Nissin&#x27; originates as an abbreviated form of the expression 「日々清らかに豊かな味をつくる」 (Hibi kiyoraka ni yutakana aji o tsukuru), coined by company founder Momofuku Ando, and representing his desire for the company. The expression can be loosely translated as &quot;Day after day purely create great taste&quot;.

<text>Tyler&#x27;s mouse opossum (&quot;Marmosa tyleriana&quot;) is a South American marsupial of the family Didelphidae. It lives in rainforests of the Guiana Highlands of southern Venezuela at elevations between 1300 and 2200 m. The species has only been found on three isolated tepuis (Auyantepui, Marahuaca and Sarisariñama). All three of these locations are in protected areas (Canaima, Duida-Marahuaca and Jaua-Sarisariñama national parks).

The Latin species name refers to the habitat in which the opossum was first found, a &quot;Tyleria&quot; forest. In turn, both the genus &quot;Tyleria&quot; and the opossum&#x27;s common name refer to Sidney F. Tyler, an American historian and photographer who helped finance the 1928-29 expedition of the American Museum of Natural History to the headwaters of the Orinoco, during which the opossum was discovered.

<doc id="639921" wikidata="Q11884307" url="?curid=639921" title="Nicholls State University">
<text>Nicholls State University is a public university in Thibodaux, Louisiana. Founded in 1948, Nicholls is part of the University of Louisiana System. Originally named Francis T. Nicholls Junior College, the university is named for Francis T. Nicholls, a former governor of Louisiana, member of the Louisiana Supreme Court, and general in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. 

The campus, once part of Acadia Plantation, fronts on Bayou Lafourche, about southwest of New Orleans and southeast of Baton Rouge. Its oldest structure, Elkins Hall, was completed in 1948 and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Nicholls is located in the Acadiana region. It is also within the geographical bounds of the Mississippi River Delta, and close to the Mississippi River, its distributaries, Louisiana&#x27;s wetlands, and the Gulf of Mexico.

==History==

Nicholls State opened on Sept. 23, 1948, as Francis T. Nicholls Junior College of Louisiana State University. In 1956, the Louisiana Legislature separated Nicholls State from LSU and authorized it to develop four-year curricula. In September 1956, the former junior college became Francis T. Nicholls State College and granted its first degrees in May 1958. In 1970, Act 93 of the State Legislature changed the name of the institution to Nicholls State University.

<doc id="639924" wikidata="Q474191" url="?curid=639924" title="Diet (nutrition)">
<text>In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism.
The word diet often implies the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos. This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy.

Complete nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids from protein and essential fatty acids from fat-containing food, also food energy in the form of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in the quality of life, health and longevity.

== Health ==

A healthy diet can improve and maintain health, which can include aspects of mental and physical health. Specific diets, such as the DASH diet, can be used in treatment and management of chronic conditions. A 2024 review highlighted that bioactive compounds found in Mediterranean diet components (such as olive, grape, garlic, rosemary, and saffron) exhibit properties that may contribute to cardiovascular health.

Dietary recommendations exist for many different countries, and they usually emphasise a balanced diet which is culturally appropriate. These recommendation are different from dietary reference values which provide information about the prevention of nutrient deficiencies. 

== Dietary choices ==

Exclusionary diets are diets with certain groups or specific types of food avoided, either due to health considerations or by choice. Many do not eat food from animal sources to varying degrees (e.g. flexitarianism, pescetarianism, vegetarianism, and veganism) for health reasons, issues surrounding morality, or to reduce their personal impact on the environment (e.g. environmental vegetarianism). People on a balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can obtain adequate nutrition, but may need to specifically focus on consuming specific nutrients, such as protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. Raw foodism and intuitive eating are other approaches to dietary choices. Education, income, local availability, and mental health are all major factors for dietary choices.

== Weight management ==
A particular diet may be chosen to promote weight loss or weight gain. Changing a person&#x27;s dietary intake, or &quot;going on a diet&quot;, can change the energy balance, and increase or decrease the amount of fat stored by the body. The terms &quot;healthy diet&quot; and &quot;diet for weight management&quot; (&quot;dieting&quot;) are often related, as the two promote healthy weight management. If a person is overweight or obese, changing to a diet and lifestyle that allows them to burn more calories than they consume may improve their overall health, possibly preventing diseases that are attributed in part to weight, including heart disease and diabetes. Within the past 10 years, obesity rates have increased by almost 10%. Conversely, if a person is underweight due to illness or malnutrition, they may change their diet to promote weight gain. Intentional changes in weight, though often beneficial, can be potentially harmful to the body if they occur too rapidly. Unintentional rapid weight change can be caused by the body&#x27;s reaction to some medications, or may be a sign of major medical problems including thyroid issues and cancer among other diseases.

=== Eating disorders ===

An eating disorder is a mental disorder that interferes with normal food consumption. It is defined by abnormal eating habits, and thoughts about food that may involve eating much more or much less than needed. Common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Eating disorders affect people of every gender, age, socioeconomic status, and body size.

== Environmental dietary choices ==
Agriculture is a driver of environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, climate change, desertification, soil degradation and pollution. The food system as a whole – including refrigeration, food processing, packaging, and transport – accounts for around one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. More sustainable dietary choices can be made to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. These choices may involve reducing consumption of meat and dairy products and instead eating more plant-based foods, and eating foods grown through sustainable farming practices.

== Religious and cultural dietary choices ==
Some cultures and religions have restrictions concerning what foods are acceptable in their diet. For example, only Kosher foods are permitted in Judaism, and Halal foods in Islam. Although Buddhists are generally vegetarians, the practice varies and meat-eating may be permitted depending on the sects. In Hinduism, vegetarianism is the ideal. Jains are strictly vegetarian and in addition to that the consumption of any roots (ex: potatoes, carrots) is not permitted. 

In Christianity there is no restriction on the kinds of animals that can be eaten, though various groups within Christianity have practiced specific dietary restrictions for various reasons. The most common diets used by Christians are Mediterranean and vegetarianism.

<text>In politics, a diet ( ) is a formal deliberative assembly. The term is used historically for deliberative assemblies such as the German Imperial Diet (the general assembly of the Imperial Estates of the Holy Roman Empire), as well as a designation for modern-day legislative bodies of certain countries and states such as the National Diet of Japan, or the German Bundestag, the Federal Diet.

== Etymology ==
The term (also in the nutritional sense) might be derived from Medieval Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning both &quot;parliamentary assembly&quot; and &quot;daily food allowance&quot;, from earlier Latin , possibly from the Greek (&quot;arbitration&quot;), or transcribing Classical Greek (), meaning &quot;way of living&quot;, and hence also &quot;diet&quot; (regular food), &quot;regular (daily) work&quot;.

Through a false etymology, reflected in the spelling change replacing &quot;ae&quot; with &quot;e&quot;, the word &quot;diet&quot; (&quot;diaeta&quot;) came to be associated with Latin , &quot;day&quot;. It came to be used in postclassical Europe in the sense of &quot;an assembly&quot; because of its use for the work of an assembly meeting on a daily basis or a given day of the time period, and hence for the assembly itself.

The association with &quot;dies&quot; is reflected in the German language&#x27;s use of (meeting) and , meaning &quot;day&quot;, as in (Monday) and also &quot;parliament&quot;, &quot;council&quot;, or other legislative chamber, as in or for national parliaments, and &quot;Landtag&quot; for regional assemblies.

== Historic uses ==
In this sense, it commonly refers to the Imperial Diet assemblies of the Holy Roman Empire:
*Diet of Augsburg
*Diet of Nuremberg
*Diet of Regensburg
*Diet of Speyer
*Diet of Worms

After the Second Peace of Thorn of 1466, a German-language Prussian diet Landtag was held in the lands of Royal Prussia, a province of Poland in personal union with the king of Poland.

The Croatian word for a legislative assembly is (from the verb , &quot;to assemble&quot;); in historic contexts it is often translated with &quot;diet&quot; in English, as in &quot;the Diet of Dalmatia&quot; (&#x27;), &quot;the Croatian Diet&quot; (&#x27;), &quot;the Hungarian-Croatian Diet&quot; (&quot;&quot;), or Diet of Bosnia ().

The Diet of Hungary, customarily called together every three years in Székesfehérvár, Buda or Pressburg, was also called &quot;Diéta&quot; in the Habsburg Empire before the 1848 revolution.

The Riksdag of the Estates was the diet of the four estates of Sweden, from the 15th century until 1866. The Diet of Finland was the successor to the Riksdag of the Estates in the Grand Duchy of Finland, from 1809 to 1906.

The Swiss legislature was the () before the Federal Assembly replaced it in the mid-19th century.

The Polish-Lithuanian Sejm was sometimes called a diet.

== Current use ==
* The National Diet of Japan, the country&#x27;s legislative body.
* Some universities in the UK and India refer to the period of formal examination and the conclusion of an academic term as an &quot;examination diet&quot;.
*Scottish legal procedures include diets of proof, debate, appeal or meeting which may be ordered by a court.

<text>Darfield is a village within the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. It is historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The village is situated approximately east from Barnsley town centre. Darfield had a population of 8,066 at the 2001 UK Census, increasing to 10,685 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
Roman coins have been unearthed in Darfield, and there is evidence to suggest that the village contained Roman habitation during its history.

In Saxon, the name &quot;Feld&quot; describes &quot; &#x27;a large area of pasture land&#x27; &quot;, while the term &quot;Dere&quot; refers to the deer which inhabited the forest. When combined, this gives the name &quot;Derefeld&quot; which later became &quot;Darfield&quot;.

There are records of an 8th-century church in Darfield, but when the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; was written in 1086 there was no mention of it.

Darfield remained an insignificant agricultural village for many centuries to come, until 1862. In that year, two mining companies sank shafts in the Barnsley district to exploit the rich seam of coal running through the area. Darfield Main colliery and Mitchell&#x27;s Main were local mines, the population of the village quickly increased and it became a labour pool for the surrounding coal mines. By 1901, over 4,000 people lived there compared to just 600 inhabitants in 1851.

Until June 1963, Darfield had a railway station on the Sheffield - Cudworth - Leeds line. The line itself closed in 1988 due to severe mining subsidence.

==Community==
Darfield shops include a Co-op supermarket, a florist&#x27;s, baker&#x27;s, newsagent&#x27;s, two hairdresser&#x27;s, garage/MOT station, a post office, greetings card shop, and a hardware &amp; homeware shop. Two village chemists are based inside the local doctors&#x27; surgery and on Snape Hill Road. Food outlets include two Indian restaurants (formerly The Bridge Inn and The Station public house) two takeaway cafes, two fish and chip shops, a Chinese takeaway and a pizzeria.
Four pubs survive in the village; Cross Keys, Queen Victoria, the Darfield and the Sportsman Inn.
There are also two clubs; the Village club and the Conservative club. The cricket club also has a bar.
Darfield is the home to the Maurice Dobson museum which is divided into four parts: the main museum, an outlet area where local people can sell their craft items, a cafe/gallery, and a meeting place. There is also an outdoor patio where some larger items are exhibited. The museum&#x27;s property was donated to the village by Maurice Dobson, after whom the museum is named. There is also a small village public library. Religion is served by an Anglican parish church and two Methodist chapels.

Ebenezer Elliott, the Corn Law Rhymer, is buried in Darfield All Saints churchyard.
==Transport==
Stagecoach Yorkshire operate bus services every 15 minutes to Barnsley Interchange using the 218, 219, and X19 services during the daytime as well as two buses per hour to Wombwell. Darfield is also served by the express bus service X19 which operates direct to Doncaster Frenchgate Interchange. Also, both Wombwell and Goldthorpe railway stations are within easy reach of Darfield where connections can be made to Sheffield, Meadowhall, Wakefield and Leeds.

==Education==
Darfield schools include:
* Darfield Upperwood Academy, a 4–11 primary school, opened on 5 November 1973, that educates around 250 pupils. In July 2006 it was reported in the &quot;Barnsley Chronicle&quot; that a special investigation by council auditors into the school accounts raised questions about the way it was using public money. This received national media coverage when it appeared in the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; in March 2007.
* Outwood Primary Academy Darfield (formerly Darfield Valley Primary School), Snape Hill Road, Darfield.
* All Saints&#x27; Academy (formerly Darfield All Saints&#x27; Primary School), a Church of England primary school with academy status. Located on School Street, Darfield.
* Netherwood Academy a secondary school formed in September 2012 from a merger between Darfield Foulstone School and Wombwell High School. Darfield Foulstone School of Creative Arts, Nanny Marr Road, Darfield, no longer exists, because it was demolished at the beginning of 2013 following the opening of the Netherwood Advanced Learning Centre.

==Sport==
Darfield Park Crown Green Bowling Club was established in 1922 by the Miner’s welfare scheme. The distinctive original club house and ground still remain on Church Street opposite Darfield Library. The club celebrated its centenary in 2022 and is always looking for new members to strengthen this local asset. 

Darfield has a cricket club which plays at Darfield Cricket Ground and a junior football team which is Darfield JFC, they have played on the Longbow playing fields former Darfield Foulstone School Fields for the last 21 years.

<text>Darfield is a town in the Selwyn District of the South Island of New Zealand. It is 35 kilometres west of Christchurch and has a population of as of .

Darfield is the main town between Christchurch and the West Coast region. It is often called &quot;The township under the nor&#x27;west arch&quot; in reference to a characteristic weather phenomenon that often creates an arch of cloud in an otherwise clear sky to the west of the township. This is caused by the condensation of water particles channelled upwards over the Southern Alps.

Darfield lies in the Malvern district&#x27;s arable and pastoral farming area. It is a gateway to the scenic Waimakariri and Rakaia rivers and the Southern Alps, and is also a popular lift-off place for hot air ballooning.

Darfield is located around the former junction of the railway lines coming from Christchurch and going to Whitecliffs (where coal was mined) and Springfield and on to the West Coast.

==History==
Darfield was first known as White Cliffs Junction, but was then renamed in 1879 to Horndon Junction. This name was changed again to avoid confusion with Hornby [railway] Junction (close by in Christchurch).

Darfield acquired its name from John Jebson who named it after the village in Yorkshire, England. The name refers to a field frequented by deer.

<doc id="639936" wikidata="Q1114985" url="?curid=639936" title="Comix Zone">
<text>Comix Zone (コミックスゾーン) is a 1995 beat &#x27;em up video game developed and published by Sega for the Genesis. It is set within the panels of a comic book with dialogue rendered within talk bubbles and sprites, and backgrounds possessing the bright colors and dynamic drawing style of superhero comics. This style is in previous video games, for example Ocean Software&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 1988, but &quot;Comix Zone&quot; stretched the idea to such an extent that Sega applied for and was granted a patent for a &quot;videogame system for creating a simulated comic book game&quot;.

The concept for the game originated from a 1992 demo video for the Amiga titled &quot;Joe Pencil Trapped In The Comix Zone&quot;, animated by Peter Morawiec. It explores how the gameplay and the comic book elements would blend in. &quot;Comix Zone&quot; received a mainly positive critical reception, although critique was given to certain elements such as perceived high difficulty.

==Plot==

Sketch Turner, a &quot;starving artist&quot; and freelance rock musician living in New York City, is working on his newest comic book, &quot;Comix Zone&quot;. It is the story of the New World Empire&#x27;s attempt to defend Earth from an invasion of alien renegades, with inspiration coming from Sketch&#x27;s oddly vivid dreams and nightmares. One night, while Sketch is working on &quot;Comix Zone&quot; during a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt strikes a panel of his comic. In this instant, its main villain, a powerful mutant named Mortus, escapes the comic book&#x27;s pages, desiring to kill Sketch so he can become flesh and blood and take over the real world. Because he does not possess any power in reality, Mortus sends Sketch into the world of his own comic, freely drawing in enemies attempting to kill him.

Inside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is &quot;the chosen one&quot; who came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch&#x27;s protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio. It is up to Sketch to stop Mortus&#x27;s evil plans and find a way out of his own comic.

At the end of the game, Sketch and Alissa reach a weapons factory hidden on a derelict ship and Alissa attempts to defuse a nuclear weapon that Mortus and the Mutants plan on using to wipe out the New World Empire and humanity. Before she can finish Mortus suddenly comes back into the comic and throws her into a chamber that starts to fill up with liquid. Mortus then battles Sketch personally and depending on how quickly the players defeat him they can trigger one of two endings. 

If Mortus and the Kreeps he summons are defeated quickly enough the player can trigger a switch and drain the liquid from the chamber Alissa is trapped in. Alissa will then be freed just before the nuke self-destructs. Following this Alissa comes to the real world with Sketch and Roadkill and joins the army, eventually becoming Chief of Security for the United States. Roadkill is given a vast amount of mozzarella cheese and spends a lot of time exploring the city&#x27;s new sewer system when not sleeping under a pile of Sketch&#x27;s dirty socks. &quot;Comix Zone&quot; becomes an instant sensation, selling out on the first day, making Sketch famous as it becomes the best-selling comic book ever and the three live happily together, though a sequel hook in the end credits ominously implies that might change someday...

If the players take too long to defeat Mortus though the chamber will completely fill with liquid and Alissa will drown shortly before the nuke self-destructs. Sketch and Roadkill come out, but Sketch&#x27;s comic is destroyed, leaving him devastated at having saved the New World Empire, but not Alissa. The end credits then imply that he will re-create his comic in an attempt to ensure a happy ending.

== Gameplay==
&quot;Comix Zone&quot; is an action platformer in which players control Sketch as he progresses through panels of his comic book, hoping to reach the end and escape before his own creations finish him off. Each level consists of two pages and secrets are discovered by shredding the paper and revealing items. Along with standard attacks such as punching, kicking, and jump attacks, Sketch can store up to three items in his inventory to help him overcome obstacles. Along with weapons such as bombs and knives which can also be used to destroy obstacles, Sketch can pick up iced tea to restore his health, and a fist that transforms Sketch into Super Sketch, dealing a powerful attack on all on-screen enemies. His pet rat Roadkill can discover hidden items and access areas that are too dangerous for Sketch to reach.

Sketch can also tear off the backdrop into a paper plane to throw at enemies, but this costs health and can also hurt Sketch if he&#x27;s not careful. In order to progress through the pages, Sketch often has to either successfully solve a puzzle, or defeat all the enemies within that panel. Arrows will then appear, allowing Sketch to jump to another panel, with some areas offering multiple routes.

Sketch&#x27;s health is determined by a health bar, which is diminished when Sketch is damaged by enemies or obstacles. It will also diminish as Sketch punches through breakable objects or if he uses his paper plane move. If Sketch loses all his life, or falls down a bottomless pit, the game will end and Mortus will take his place in the real world.

However, the player can gain extra chances by clearing the first and second chapters, which allow Sketch to resume from the beginning of the page should he die. &quot;Comix Zone&quot; is designed to be used with the 6-button gamepad: buttons X, Y and Z correspond to the three inventory slots Sketch has. If used with a 3-button gamepad, button C cycles through the items, and button A activates the item. Button C on a 6-button gamepad is used for a custom action, blocking by default; on a 3-button gamepad, Sketch blocks automatically.

==Development==
===Conception===
&quot;Comix Zone&quot; was conceived by the Sega Technical Institute (STI) programmer Peter Morawiec. Many of Morawiec&#x27;s fellow STI developers were comic book fans and made monthly trips to local comic shops. He devised the &quot;Comix Zone&quot; concept after joining his co-workers on one of their trips to a shop in Palo Alto, California. Morawiec &quot;felt that comics and games could be very complementary&quot; and began working on a technology demonstration for his Amiga. The story was inspired by the 1985 music video for &quot;Take On Me&quot; by A-ha, which depicts a race car driver in a comic book connecting with a woman in the real world. Morawiec added a dystopian setting based on his passion for science fiction films.

Morawiec presented the video, &quot;Joe Pencil Trapped in the Comix Zone&quot;, to STI head Roger Hector in December 1992. Hector was enthralled by the concept, saying: &quot;The minute I saw it, I knew it was going to be great.&quot; He encouraged Morawiec to pitch it directly to Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske, who approved it. Although Kalinske wanted development to begin immediately, &quot;Comix Zone&quot; was placed on hold so STI could work on &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; (1993), as Sega wanted to have a &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game available for the 1993 Christmas shopping season. Following &quot;Spinball&quot; release, STI pitched several concepts, including &quot;Comix Zone&quot;, to Sega management. Kalinske remembered &quot;Comix Zone&quot; and asked STI to begin development.

Morawiec approached programmer Adrian Stephens, who had joined STI as a programmer as &quot;Spinball&quot; was nearing completion, about working on &quot;Comix Zone&quot;. Development began with a three-man team of Morawiec, Stephens, and executive producer Dean Lester. According to Hector, &quot;It took a few months to put together a team capable of delivering the game&quot;. The team grew as large as a dozen people and was given high priority at STI and the full support of the studio. Additional staff included Jonah Hex co-creator Tony DeZuniga, comic book artist Alex Niño, lead animator Bob Steele, artist Chris Senn, programmer Stieg Hedlund, and associate producer Mike Wallis. Hector, who served as the manager, credited Morawiec as the project lead.

===Production===
The initial protagonist was Joe Pencil, a &quot;geeky-looking&quot; character who Morawiec based on &quot;the classic comic book angle of a scrawny kid getting transformed into a powerful superhero.&quot; Sega&#x27;s marketing department objected to the character&#x27;s name and design, so he was renamed Sketch Turner and Morawiec, a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins, redesigned him to resemble a grunge rocker. The marketing department also demanded, against Morawiec&#x27;s wishes, that Sketch have a sidekick, a popular trend in games at the time. Morawiec did not want Sketch to be followed by a human or a large animal, so he conceived Roadkill since a rat &quot;didn&#x27;t take up a lot of screen space, and we could do quite a bit with it in terms of puzzles and such.&quot; The marketing department felt that a pet rat was an awkward choice, but Lester and the other developers supported it.

STI sought to design &quot;Comix Zone&quot; faithfully to its comic book theme, including in its animation style. DeZuniga designed the beginning and ending sequences; he drew the art with ink and pencils before scanning it into a computer and processing it for the Genesis. Senn contributed character animations as well as some background art and bosses. As development progressed, Stephens found it challenging to program the game so it would fit within two megabytes while being able to decompress large pages of graphics during play. He noted that the Genesis was not designed with this process in mind, but was pleased that he managed to make it happen. When STI sent &quot;Comix Zone&quot; to Sega of Japan for review, it received a note claiming the game &quot;embodied everything that was wrong with American culture&quot;. Hedlund said the team took this as &quot;high praise&quot;.

&quot;Comix Zone&quot; became STI&#x27;s top project with the full support of Sega&#x27;s marketing department. The development was relatively smooth, though the game was repeatedly delayed so the team could add more features, leading to a release late in the Genesis&#x27; lifecycle. &quot;Comix Zone&quot; was one of the only two games, the other being &quot;The Ooze&quot;, to bear the STI logo. It was the first game that Wallis worked on during his time at Sega, and the last Genesis game Senn worked on. The soundtrack was composed by Howard Drossin, who used the GEMS sound driver and chose a rock music style. Drossin sought to demonstrate the sound capabilities of the Genesis and that it could produce more than just chiptune. He provided most of the male audio clips, while various administrative assistants provided female audio clips. Morawiec contributed the voice of the villain Gravis.

Late in development, Sega&#x27;s testing department recommended that the difficulty level be increased. Average players found it difficult to complete the game as a result, and Morawiec expressed regret that he followed the test department&#x27;s recommendation. As development concluded, pressure was mounting as the American STI team had not released a game since &quot;Spinball&quot;. Further complicating matters was the forthcoming release of Sega&#x27;s new consoles, the 32X and Sega Saturn, and Stephens expecting a child. Resultingly, &quot;Comix Zone&quot; scope was reduced for a sooner-than-planned release and two levels had to be removed. In retrospect, Morawiec felt the development would have greatly benefited from the contributions of STI&#x27;s more experienced Japanese staff, who had split from the main team following the release of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992).

==Release==
&quot;Comix Zone&quot; was released for the Genesis in North America in July 1995, in Japan on September 1, 1995, and in Europe on September 1995. The game received a small print run in Japan and became an expensive collector&#x27;s item in the years following its release. A port for Windows was released in North America in November 1995 and in Europe in March 1996. The port, released when Microsoft was promoting Windows 95 as a legitimate game platform, is largely identical to the Genesis version, though it features a MIDI rendition of the soundtrack. Sales of &quot;Comix Zone&quot; were hampered by its late release in the Genesis&#x27; lifecycle, after the worldwide launch of next-generation hardware like the Saturn and Sony&#x27;s PlayStation. According to Stephens, Hector said that &quot;Comix Zone&quot; failed to break even, which Morawiec attributed to the popularity of the PlayStation.

To promote &quot;Comix Zone&quot; as &quot;edgy and cool&quot;, Sega bundled &quot;Comix Zone&quot; with a CD featuring rock songs by popular bands such as Love and Rockets, Danzig, and the Jesus and Mary Chain. STI originally planned for the bundled CD to contain several &quot;Comix Zone&quot; tracks performed by a grunge band that Drossin had formed in Los Angeles, but Sega chose a different approach. Morawiec said that the team, particularly Drossin, was upset by the change, though their planned CD was still manufactured and distributed via a magazine, European and Windows copies, and Sega&#x27;s short-lived Sega Tunes label. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; described the rock CD as &quot;a stunt that further drives the nineties-ness of [&quot;Comix Zone&quot;] as a time capsule for an era when game companies often released a lot of crazy promotional crap to sell their products&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;GamePro&quot; considered the game&#x27;s visuals a successful recreation of the look and feel of a comic book, but said that the game quickly sours once the player encounters the repetitive combat and overly simplistic puzzles. They also found problems with the controls: &quot;Sketch can&#x27;t move rapidly around the panel, and button slamming yields unpredictable results.&quot; They concluded, &quot;You really want to love &quot;Comix Zone&quot; for its original elements, but after a few panels, the honeymoon&#x27;s over.&quot; The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; acknowledged the problems with the controls, but also remarked that the graphics are exceptionally colorful for a Genesis game, and argued that the originality of its comic book look makes it a must-have despite its flaws.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Genesis version of the game and stated that while the unique concept, outstanding visuals, and solid soundtrack make the game of interest, the gameplay is derivative and repetitive. They summed up, &quot;A very cool idea for a game that wasn&#x27;t executed properly, &quot;Comix Zone&quot; is better than most.&quot; In 2017, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked Comic Zone 43rd on their &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.&quot; They lauded the animation and sound effects as &quot;magnificent&quot; and beyond the supposed limitation of the console.

==Ports and related releases==
The game was ported to Windows 3.1, with the use of WinG, in 1995 by Sega PC. It was also included in &quot;Sega Smash Pack 2&quot; (2000). The game was ported to the Game Boy Advance only in Europe on September 11, 2002, which was developed by Virtucraft and published by Sega. Its significantly smaller screen size that allows much less on-screen was said to reduce the effect of seeing into the other frames around the player, making it more like a traditional platform game.

The game is hidden within the Japanese version of &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; and can be unlocked in all versions of &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; by having a &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; game save, or by starting all other Genesis games at least 50 times. The game is part of the &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable (also called &quot;Sega Mega Drive Collection&quot; in PAL regions) On January 29, 2007, &quot;Comix Zone&quot; was released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console, and Xbox Live Arcade on June 10, 2009. The game appears in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3) and on June 3, 2010, it was released on Steam. It is also included in the Genesis pack. In August 2011, the game was made available for download on PlayStation Network as part of the &quot;Sega Vintage Collection&quot;, with trophy support.

On June 22, 2017, the game was published on iOS and Android mobile operating systems as part of the &quot;Sega Forever&quot; retro game collection.

The game is in the Genesis Mini retro console which was released on September 19, 2019.

On September 22, 2020, a vinyl record soundtrack of the game&#x27;s music was announced by record label Cartridge Thunder. The record release features the original Sega Genesis soundtrack by Howard Drossin, as well as live recordings from the band Roadkill.

On June 30, 2022, the game was released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

<doc id="639951" wikidata="Q1083409" url="?curid=639951" title="Bougainville Revolutionary Army">
<text>The Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) was a secessionist group formed in 1988 by Bougainvilleans seeking independence from Papua New Guinea (PNG). The leader of the BRA was Francis Ona who led the BRA against the Papua New Guinea Defence Force during the violent 10 year conflict. Not all BRA members agreed to the Peace Treaty and boycotted it, and have held out in an official no-go zone, protected by members of the Meekamui Defence Force, currently commanded by Moses Pepino.

BRA leaders argued that Bougainville is ethnically part of the Solomon Islands and has not profited from the extensive mining that has occurred on the island. In 1989, BRA leaders proclaimed Bougainville independent from PNG and established the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG). As a result, fighting between the BRA and the PNG Defence Force, with support from Australia, escalated.

In January 1991, the Honiara Declaration was signed under which both sides agreed to a ceasefire. This ceasefire was soon broken and fighting continued. In 1997, Bill Skate of the People&#x27;s National Congress Party was elected Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea and promised that peace in Bougainville would be his highest priority. This led to the signing of a ceasefire agreement, the Rotokas Record, and a movement towards peace and the autonomy of Bougainville. As a result, the BRA is no longer actively engaged in fighting, although some of its leaders are involved in the ABG.

<doc id="639954" wikidata="Q634396" url="?curid=639954" title="McNeese State University">
<text>McNeese State University is a public university in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Founded in 1939 as Lake Charles Junior College, it was renamed McNeese Junior College after John McNeese, an early local educator. The present name was adopted in 1970. McNeese is part of the University of Louisiana System and is classified as a Master&#x27;s University. The selective admissions university consists of six colleges and the Doré School of Graduate Studies. McNeese is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and all programs of study are accredited by their respective national boards.

==History==

McNeese State University was founded in 1939 as a division of Louisiana State University and was originally called Lake Charles Junior College. It offered only the first two years of higher education. McNeese opened its doors on an tract donated by the Calcasieu Parish Police Jury, the parish governing board. There were two original buildings: the former Administration Building (Kaufman Hall) and the McNeese Arena (Ralph O. Ward Memorial Gym). The auditorium, now Francis G. Bulber Auditorium, was completed in 1940 as the third building on the campus. These three buildings are still in use today. The name became John McNeese Junior College in 1940 by resolution of the University Board of Supervisors in honor of Imperial Calcasieu Parish&#x27;s first superintendent of schools.

In 1950, the college became an autonomous four-year institution as McNeese State College. The bill was advanced by State Senator Gilbert Franklin Hennigan of DeRidder in neighboring Beauregard Parish. It was separated from Louisiana State University and renamed McNeese State College. Its administration was transferred to the Louisiana State Board of Education. In 1960, legislators authorized McNeese to offer curricula leading to the master&#x27;s degree; in 1966, the degree of Educational Specialist was first offered. In 1970, its name changed to McNeese State University. McNeese was first accredited in 1954 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

McNeese&#x27;s colors are blue and gold. The men&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Cowboys, while the women&#x27;s athletic teams are the Cowgirls. McNeese State sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (Football Championship Subdivision for football) in the Southland Conference.

===Football===
The football team plays at Louis Bonnette Field at Cowboy Stadium, which seats 17,000 fans. It is also known as &quot;The Hole&quot; or lately as &quot;the lil&#x27; House&quot; and is located near campus. The team played in the inaugural Independence Bowl game in 1976, a 20–16 victory over Tulsa. They went on to make two more appearances in 1979 and 1980. The Cowboys football team have more recently played in two Division I-AA Finals, in 1997 and 2002.

===Basketball===
The Cowboys basketball and volleyball teams both moved into the venue now known as The Legacy Center in 2018. This gave the basketball teams their first on-campus facility since leaving the Ralph O. Ward arena. In 1956 the Cowboys won the NAIA Division I Men&#x27;s Tournament. It was the only appearance the Cowboys made in the NAIA tournament. McNeese State defeated Texas Southern 60 to 55. The men&#x27;s basketball team has made three appearances in the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament, most recently in 2024, and the team has qualified for the NIT three times, the most recent invitation being in 2011. The school&#x27;s most famous basketball alumnus is Joe Dumars, who was a first-round draft pick (18th overall) of the Detroit Pistons in 1985 and went on to have a Hall of Fame career with them.

The women&#x27;s basketball team earned its invitation to the &quot;Big Dance&quot; in 2011, by sweeping the Southland Conference Tournament. In 2011, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams claimed the Southland Conference title in their respective divisions, marking the first time in the 25-year history of the Southland Conference that the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams from the same university have won regular-season titles in the same year.

===Baseball===
The baseball team plays games at Cowboy Diamond. The Cowboys&#x27; baseball teams have made several appearances in the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship, most recently in 2000, 2003, and 2019.

===Soccer===
The McNeese Cowgirls soccer team plays their games at Cowgirl Field. The soccer program began in 1996, and has since claimed 1 regular season Southland Conference Championship in 2007 and 1 Southland Conference tournament Championships in 13 tournament appearances. In 2015, the Cowgirl Soccer Team named Drew Fitzgerald just the second Head Coach in program history, following Scooter Savoie who had been at the helm since the founding of the program in 1996. Fitzgerald, who had previously served as the team&#x27;s associate head coach, made an immediate impact in the program, leading the Cowgirls to a 9–10–1 record and taking the sixth place seed in their 13th Southland Conference tournament appearance and their first appearance in the second round of the tournament since the 2008 season. The last and only time the Cowgirl Soccer team was able to capture the Southland Conference tournament title and earn a bid to the NCAA Championship tournament was in 2006, when the team suffered a 2-0 first round loss to Southern Methodist University.

==Student life==

The McNeese State University newspaper is &quot;The Contraband&quot;, a weekly publication which has existed since 1939. The university&#x27;s student yearbook is &quot;The Log&quot;. It was first published in 1941.

<doc id="639963" wikidata="Q5133146" url="?curid=639963" title="Clifton, Staten Island">
<text>Clifton is a neighborhood on the North Shore of Staten Island in New York City, United States. It is an older waterfront neighborhood, facing Upper New York Bay on the east. It is bordered on the north by Stapleton, on the south by Rosebank, on the southwest by Concord, and on the west by Van Duzer Street.

==History==

The name &quot;Clifton&quot; for the area dates to 1817, when a town by the name, larger in area than the present neighborhood, was laid out along the waterfront. In its early history, much of the surrounding land was owned by the Vanderbilt family. As a young man, Cornelius Vanderbilt established ferry service from the waterfront to Manhattan at the foot of present Vanderbilt Avenue. Bayley Seton Hospital, north of Vanderbilt Avenue, was formerly the United States Public Health Service Hospital and housed the original headquarters of the National Institutes of Health (now located in Bethesda, Maryland).

In the 1840s, the Townsend family built a huge home that had turrets so it was called the Townsend Castle. It was located at what is now Townsend Avenue and Tompkins Avenue. In the 1870s, many roads and large homes were built near the water. The area has many Victorian houses left from the late 1800s in the area from Vanderbilt to Norwood Avenues.

In the 1880s, much of Staten Island was still very rural. Adjacent to the &quot;village of Clifton,&quot; for example, was &quot;a low range of grass hills&quot; on which were pastured 438 goats by a Frenchman named Paul Chaulmier who provided goat&#x27;s milk to wealthy New Yorkers.

In 1900, the Fox Hills Golf Club encompassed the entire area of where the Park Hill Apartments are now. There was a big clubhouse on Vanderbilt Avenue. Many tournaments were held there until 1935, when it closed. The land was taken over by the government and used for military barracks during World War II. By the 1950s, it evolved into a middle-class, multi-ethnic community of civil employees including firemen, teachers, and doctors.

The Park Hill Apartments, located on Vanderbilt Avenue and on Park Hill Avenue, were initially developed in the 1960s as a private apartment complex to which many people from the other boroughs of NYC moved after the opening of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. By the late 1960s, however, people realized that it was relatively inexpensive to move to Staten Island and purchase a home or rent an apartment in smaller buildings, which resulted in a loss of the emerging middle-class population it initially attracted. Park Hill remained privately owned but became federally subsidized low-income housing complex, and became the site of steadily increasing crime and drug abuse beginning in the early-1970s.

By the late 1980s, it had gained the nickname of &quot;Crack Hill&quot; due to the many arrests for possession and/or sale of crack cocaine that were taking place in and around the development and the adjacent Fox Hills Apartments to the south. Crime in this area has dramatically decreased since the late 1990s. Community activists are addressing the ongoing conflict between Liberian and African-American youth, primarily between the ages of 10–14. The community organizations run after-school programs to help keep the youth occupied in a productive way. This helps curb gang and street violence. The community tension that occurs in Park Hill is based on poverty and unemployment.

In the 1990s, the neighborhood became the center for an immigrant community from Liberia and West Africa around Targee Street. The residences in the neighborhood are mostly one-family houses, but the last decade has seen the development of many attached homes and duplexes.

==Community==

===Demographics===

Park Hill has been a predominantly black neighborhood for a while. However, there is a growing Asian and Hispanic population in the area. Census tract 4 has seen the second-highest growth rate in the Asian population of any census tract on Staten Island (with the highest growth rate being tract 231 in Mariners&#x27; Harbor). East of Tompkins Avenue, the White population increases noticeably.

Over the years 2000–2003, Clifton&#x27;s unemployment rate increased by 3.2 percentage points, and average wages declined by 8.7 percent, the only Staten Island zip code that experienced a decline. Hundreds of local jobs in the health care and social assistance fields were lost in the downsizing of Bayley Seton Hospital, which had been a major employer of neighborhood residents.

The bulk of the Park Hill neighborhood was built in the 1960s in keeping with New York City&#x27;s plan for urban renewal projects. It consists of of 6-story brick apartment buildings. The individual apartments contained within are quite large, with many having 2 or three bedrooms. As ownership has passed into private hands, upkeep on the apartments has dwindled, leaving many of them in a state of disrepair.

The average price of a private house in Park Hill increased from 2002 ($159,254) to 2007 ($321,426). The Clifton neighborhood consists mostly of one-family houses; however, in the past decade many duplexes and attached houses have been developed on property previously zoned for commercial use.

===Liberian community===
Park Hill/Clifton (along with nearby Stapleton) has the largest Liberian population of any city outside Africa, with an estimated 6,000 – 8,000 strong community of direct immigrants in 2007.

====History and context====
Beginning in the late 1970s, a small number of Liberians, whose nation was founded by freed American slaves in the 1840s, settled in Staten Island. The First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997) led to a flight of Liberian immigrants, fleeing ethnic struggles between the Kru, Gola and Grebo communities, corrupt government, and political strife.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Liberian immigrants in huge numbers fled Liberia, mostly trapped in the limbo of refugee camps on the borders of Guinea and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The United States government, always highly involved in Liberian affairs, began to offer refugee status (Temporary Protected Status-TPS) to displaced Liberians, especially those who had family in the United States.

The Liberian community in Clifton has been involved in a string of government lobbying campaigns since the 1990s to extend the &quot;deferred enforced departure&quot; (DED) status, which since the Presidency of Bill Clinton has had to be deferred on a yearly basis by presidential order for immigrants who fled the Liberian war without immigration visas. Clifton-based community groups like the Staten Island Liberian Community Association (SILCA) have become politically active in defending the estimated 3,600 Liberians across the country who are on DED status.

This new wave of immigration settled near the first small handful of Staten Island Liberians in the Park Hill Projects (now private apartments). As the Liberian civil war intensified, more immigrants followed, creating a vibrant community with African restaurants and businesses, and others working and building businesses across the area, notably in the Nostrand Avenue area of Brooklyn. The wife of soccer star (and former Liberian presidential candidate) George Weah owns a business in Brooklyn and lives in Staten Island. In recent years, Liberian families have been settling in nearby New Jersey, with a large community in the Trenton, New Jersey area. The area has become a regular stop for Liberian politicians and leaders visiting the United States. Local Liberian civic groups organize Liberian-American involvement in their homeland, and promote a variety of charitable missions in West Africa.

====Social issues====
The troubles of the Liberian Civil War period have been carried into the diaspora as well. There are thought to be dozens of former child soldiers living in the Park Hill area. These former child soldiers are often unwilling to talk about past experiences and fear judgment (or prosecution) for wartime deeds. Because of the large population of Liberians in the neighborhood, the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission established after the civil war sent a representative to Clifton to collect testimony from Liberian nationals who experienced the Liberian Civil War and who currently reside in the neighborhood.

While there are successful business leaders in the community, the vast majority of Staten Island&#x27;s Liberian immigrants are employed in low-wage service or medical fields. Many of the current residents of Park Hill are struggling with illiteracy, difficulty in finding employment, and poverty. Liberian immigrants in Park Hill also suffer from the legacy of poverty and violence in the wider community in which they live. While crime in the area has improved over the last 20 years, the reputation of Park Hill for gang and drug violence has afflicted some Liberian youth, already victimized by the Civil War. Liberian youths arrested while being refugee-status visa holders face deportation back to their homeland. Friction between the Liberians and some in the local African-American community, over jobs, housing, and culture, has also been a source of tension for an already troubled community.

===Public health===

Park Hill has environmental issues in regards to pollution and litter. The community&#x27;s public school system plays a large role in environmental protection including park cleanup, lake maintenance, and litter removal. Eibs Pond, part of a wetland adjacent to the Park Hill community, was recently restored by the current students of PS 57.

==Education==
Clifton is served by the intermediate school I.S.49 and the elementary school P.S.57.

==Transportation==
Staten Island Railway&#x27;s Clifton station is three stops from the Staten Island Ferry at St. George. Clifton is also served by the buses along Bay Street, the buses along Tompkins Avenue, the buses along Targee Street/Van Duzer Street, and the buses along Vanderbilt Avenue. Starting in August 2018, express bus service to and from Manhattan is also provided by the route.

Due to increased traffic congestion in Clifton, the Staten Island Transportation Task Force and Co-Chairs New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) Commissioner Iris Weinshall and Department of City Planning (DCP) Director Amanda Burden have acted to relieve the congestion in the area. The placement of more &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Yield&quot; signs in the neighborhood is another pertinent goal.

<doc id="639967" wikidata="Q1422594" url="?curid=639967" title="Sam Houston State University">
<text>Sam Houston State University (Sam Houston, SHSU or Sam) is a public research university in Huntsville, Texas. Founded in 1879, it is the third-oldest public college or university in Texas. It is one of the first normal schools west of the Mississippi River and the first in Texas. The school is named for Sam Houston, who made his home in the city and is buried there.

SHSU is a member of the Texas State University System and has an enrollment of more than 20,000 students across over 80 undergraduate, 59 master&#x27;s, and 10 doctoral degree programs. It also offers more than 20 online bachelor&#x27;s and graduate degrees. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity.&quot;

==History==

===19th and 20th centuries===
The Sam Houston State University campus was originally home to Austin College, the Presbyterian institution that relocated to Sherman, Texas, in 1876. Austin Hall was constructed in 1851 and is the oldest university building west of the Mississippi still in operation. It was renovated in 2012 and is used today for special meetings and events. Notably, Sam Houston himself attended and participated in the original dedication of the building.

Created by legislation signed by Governor Oran M. Roberts on San Jacinto Day, April 21, 1879, Sam Houston Normal Institute&#x27;s dedicated goal was to train teachers for the public schools of Texas. It was the first teacher-training school in the southwestern United States. On October 10 of the same year, the first class of 110 students and four faculty commenced instruction. The first president of the school, Bernard Mallon, died eleven days after the institute opened.

The one-room Peabody Memorial Library was the first free-standing campus library in Texas; it was constructed in 1901 with funds provided by the George Peabody Foundation. According to the Normal Institute&#x27;s catalog, the library was &quot;a very handsome structure, and specially designed for the purpose for which it is to be used. It is said that no school of this kind in the South has a Building equal to it.&quot; Fully restored, it is now used as a venue for special university events.

When the university first opened, students received a certification to teach in the state&#x27;s elementary and secondary schools. After 1919, the university began to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees. In 1936, the school awarded its first postbaccalaureate degree.

===21st century===
On May 30, 2012, SHSU-The Woodlands Center opened on the Lone Star College-Montgomery campus. The facility includes and has a five-story parking garage. The university also operates SHSU-University Park on the property of Lone Star College-University Park in unincorporated Harris County near Tomball.

===Name changes===
Throughout its history, Sam has undergone several name changes:

* 1879 (April 21): founded as Sam Houston Normal Institute
* 1923: Sam Houston State Teachers College
* 1965: Sam Houston State College
* 1969: Sam Houston State University

In April 2007, Texas House Bill 1418 passed without objection in the Texas Legislature, preventing The Texas State University System&#x27;s Board of Regents from changing the university&#x27;s name to Texas State – Huntsville.

Contrary to a popular joke—repeated by alumnus Dan Rather in his 1978 autobiography, &quot;The Camera Never Blinks&quot;—the school was never known as &quot;Sam Houston Institute of Teaching&quot; or &quot;Sam Houston Institute of Technology.&quot; This joke was expanded in 2006 into an entire feature film, &quot;Accepted&quot;, which takes place on the campus of the fictional South Harmon Institute of Technology.

==Main campus==

The oak-studded rural main campus sits on in central Huntsville. Two large agricultural complexes feature a teaching and research farm and a rodeo arena. The campus also has a planetarium, an observatory, a body farm, and an 18-hole golf course, The Bearkat Course. The mall area of the main campus includes Blatchley Bell Tower and Clock and a fountain.

The campus stood in for the fictional Austin University in the motion picture &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot;.

==Academics==
Sam Houston State&#x27;s academic departments and programs are organized into eight colleges:

* College of Business Administration
* College of Criminal Justice
* College of Education
* College of Arts and Media
* College of Humanities and Social Sciences
* College of Science &amp; Engineering Technology
* College of Health Sciences
* College of Osteopathic Medicine

Additionally, the university enrolls more than 350 high-achieving undergraduate students in the selective Elliott T. Bowers Honors College.

Programs within the College of Criminal Justice were recently ranked by the &quot;Journal of Criminal Justice&quot; in the top five nationally. The theater and dance programs were ranked by &quot;Dance Spectrum Magazine&quot; in the top 25 nationally, and according to the National Dance Association, SHSU is home to a quality athletic dance team. The university offers the only Professional Golf Management program in Texas, one of 17 in the country affiliated with the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America. SHSU also has one of the oldest speech and debate programs in the nation.

As of May 2016, the university offers:

*Eighty-eight undergraduate degree programs
*Fifty-nine master&#x27;s programs
*Eight doctoral programs (Clinical Psychology, Counselor Education, Criminal Justice, Developmental Education Administration, Educational Leadership, Forensic Science, Instructional Systems Design &amp; Technology, and Literacy)
*Twenty-one certificates

===College of Criminal Justice===
SHSU&#x27;s College of Criminal Justice is the largest and one of the oldest criminal justice programs in the nation. Huntsville has long been associated with criminal justice, being the co-headquarters of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and the home of several prisons, including the Texas State Penitentiary, nicknamed the &quot;Walls Unit&quot; which houses the state&#x27;s execution chamber, located about two blocks north of the campus.

In 1970, the college became one of the first programs in the U.S. to offer a Ph.D. in criminal justice, and it was the first institution in the State of Texas to offer the Master of Science in Forensic Science. SHSU&#x27;s Ph.D. in Clinical Science with a Forensic emphasis is one of seven such accredited programs in the U.S. The college faculty were recently recognized as the 4th most productive nationally in their field in terms of research, and their areas of expertise range from serial murder, hate crime, and terrorism to policing, law, corrections, and security.

The College of Criminal Justice includes the headquarters of the Texas Forensic Science Commission. It also houses the Bill Blackwood Law Enforcement Management Institute of Texas, which specializes in training for local, state, and federal law enforcement officers in the area of management and supervision. The college also houses a working courtroom where students can observe and analyze real trials.

===Texas Studies===
The university has been commended as of late for offering courses that encourage the study of the lore, the lure, and the history of the Lone Star State. In 2012, digital archivists at the university library worked with officials at a local veterans museum to launch the Texas Military Veterans Oral History collection.

== Athletics ==

Sam Houston State&#x27;s colors are bright orange and white and their nickname is the Bearkats. Sam Houston sports teams participate in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as a member of Conference USA. The Sam Houston Bearkats won the 2020 NCAA Division I (FCS) Football Championship over South Dakota State by a score of 23–21 and finished with a perfect 10–0 season record. The victory was the first Bearkat football national championship since the team won a share of the 1964 NAIA Championship. The 2020 season marked Sam Houston&#x27;s third trip to the championship game in ten seasons.

SHSU&#x27;s athletic teams have been nicknamed &quot;The Bearkats&quot; since 1923 when the university&#x27;s name was changed by the Texas State Legislature from Sam Houston Normal Institute to Sam Houston State Teachers College. Before 1923, the varsity sports teams were nicknamed &quot;The Normals&quot;.

It is doubtful those who coined the &quot;Bearkat&quot; nickname had a particular animal in mind. More likely, the name came from a popular local saying of the time, &quot;tough as a Bearkat!&quot; The late Reed Lindsey, who was a student/athlete in the 1920s and later retired as University registrar, once said that &quot;it was a good fighting name of the time.&quot; Since the animal in the saying was thought more mythical than real, the spelling settled upon was &quot;Bearkat.&quot; However, there are some arguments that the Sam Houston Bearkat is modeled after either a Binturong or a Kinkajou.

In the late 1940s, then SHSU president Harmon Lowman attempted to change the SHSU mascot from Bearkats to &quot;Ravens&quot; (after General Sam Houston&#x27;s Cherokee nickname). Mrs. Vernon Schuder reported that the alumni were polled and she voted for the Raven but that &quot;all those old Bearkats beat us out!&quot;

A Sammy Bearkat mascot character began appearing at SHSU sports events in 1959, with the addition of a Samantha character in 1986. Samantha retired in 2005.

===Rivalries===
SHSU&#x27;s primary rival is Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) and tensions between the two schools can run high before major sporting events that pit one against the other. SHSU and SFA are separated by 90 miles and both schools are located in the Piney Woods. The annual football game between SHSU and SFA named the Battle of the Piney Woods, dates back to 1923. Since 2010, the series has been played at NRG Stadium in Houston. The game was not scheduled for the 2023–24 season after conference changes were announced. SHSU holds a 60-34-2 lead in the series and has won the last 11 meetings. 

SHSU is also rivals with Texas State University (formerly SWT). SHSU and TXST have met 92 times, with the Bobcats leading the series 50-37-5. The game was played every year from 1946-2011. SHSU and TXST are members of the TSUS. Both schools formerly competed in the Southland Conference. The schools are scheduled to meet at NRG Stadium in 2024.

===Mascot===

Sam Houston&#x27;s Bearkat is represented by Sammy Bearkat, a costumed mascot, who has entertained and led crowds in cheers during sporting events since 1959.

===Club sports===
Club sports are very popular at SHSU. Some available to students include powerlifting, ultimate frisbee, lacrosse, rugby, martial arts, trap and skeet, inline hockey, basketball, volleyball, soccer, tennis, and baseball. In 2013, the Sam Houston quidditch team won the IQA World Cup VI Division II Championship.

The Spirit Programs, cheer, dance, and mascots, of Sam Houston hold the most National titles out of all of the sports and recreational activities at Sam Houston.

==Campus media==
The SHSU School of Mass Communication operates KSHU, a student-run radio (90.5 FM) and television (cable channel 7) station, broadcasting news, sports, and entertainment programming for the campus and community. &quot;The Houstonian&quot; is the student-published twice-weekly campus newspaper. Broadcast studios and offices for all three media are located within the Dan Rather Communication Building.

The &quot;Alcalde&quot; was the university&#x27;s annual yearbook, published from 1910 to 1998 and 2003 to 2006; it was named in honor of Texas Governor Oran Roberts, whose nickname was &quot;The Old Alcalde&quot;.

==Affiliated institutions==
The university operates a charter school network: the administrative offices are on the university grounds in Huntsville, but all of the charter schools are in Greater Houston. The network began in 2017 as laboratory schools. The university chose to use space in daycare facilities to host its charter campuses.

* Spring Woods (K–2) – located at Spring Woods United Methodist Church

<text>Darren James (born Darren Keith Edwards; February 25, 1964) is an American former pornographic actor and director. He gained notoriety after he contracted HIV and infected three pornographic actresses in 2004.

==Discovery of infection and aftermath==
In an attempt to prevent a possible outbreak, an urgent search was initiated for potentially infected performers. The search and subsequent testing were conducted by the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation, where James had received his diagnosis. It was concluded that James had possibly been infected while engaging in unprotected anal sex with Brazilian actress Bianca Biaggi during a scene for the video &quot;Split That Booty 2&quot; in Rio de Janeiro.

It was discovered that three actresses who had worked with James shortly after his return to the United States had also become infected: Canadian newcomer Lara Roxx, American Mariesa Arroyo, and Czech-born Jessica Dee. Roxx had entered the adult industry only two months before contracting the virus. Upon learning about the HIV outbreak, she has said, &quot;It totally made me realize how I trusted this system that wasn&#x27;t to be trusted at all, because it obviously doesn&#x27;t work,&quot; and &quot;I thought porn people were the cleanest people in the world.&quot;

Judy Star appeared in several movies Roxx also appeared in and was known to have performed a sex scene with a female actress who had performed a scene with James. Star, however, tested negative for HIV. The ensuing fears of HIV infection (as well as the public scandal and criticism of the industry that followed the outbreak) caused a temporary shutdown of production of adult movies in Southern California.

According to James, his diagnosis and the public disclosure thereof — which was how his family learned of his pornographic career — left him so distraught that he attempted suicide. After his recovery, he sued the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation for publicly disclosing his condition. The lawsuit was settled out of court, with terms remaining confidential. James went on to find employment as a security guard. In 2005, the porn industry shutdown was the subject of the first episode of &quot;The Dark Side of Porn&quot;, a British documentary series produced for Channel 4.

James has remained very vocal about the incident and about adult filmmakers&#x27; continuing their habits &quot;as usual&quot;. He is a staunch advocate of the mandatory use of condoms on porn sets to protect performers from HIV. Canadian documentary filmmaker Mia Donovan made a documentary film &quot;Inside Lara Roxx&quot; (2011), after following Roxx&#x27;s life for five years, with candid interviews and documentation, in addition to footage from Darren James.

==Career==
James appeared in 398 videos in his pornographic career. He also directed 8 pornographic films.

<text>The Motorola MPx200 smartphone was launched in December 2003 as a joint venture between Motorola and Microsoft. The mobile phone&#x27;s Windows Mobile for Smartphone OS allows users to access email and the Internet, use MSN Messenger, and view documents in Microsoft Office formats (with third-party software) much like other Windows smartphones such as the Samsung SGH-i600 or HTC Tanager. The MPx200, along with the Samsung SCH-i600, were the first Windows Mobile smartphone devices to have wide distribution in the United States. Previously, smartphone platform devices could only be purchased in the United States as part of development kits sold by Microsoft. The only U.S. carrier of the phone was AT&amp;T Wireless; however, reports also suggest a somewhat limited number of devices with Cingular branding have appeared following the purchase of AT&amp;T Wireless by Cingular.

A common complaint about this device is that it continued to ship with the WM Smartphone 2002 operating system even after most competing Windows smartphones like the Samsung i600 or HTC Voyager shipped with Windows Mobile 2003 or at least offered an official upgrade path.

The release of the Motorola MPx220, which runs Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition, an upgraded version of the MPx200 that has an integrated camera and bluetooth support, made it an obsolete smartphone, making the release of official OS updates look pointless.

However, this led to the release of leaked unofficial upgrades for the MPx200 over the internet, with the community constantly improving them and eliminating the existing bugs.
So far a Windows Mobile 2003 upgrade, and Windows Mobile 5, 6, 6.1 and 6.5 OS upgrades have been made available. The MPx200 is the only phone that has ROMs available for all existing versions of Windows Mobile Standard. No leaked WM5 or WM6 images exist for the MPx220 as of yet.

As a result of the limited 32 MB ROM memory, the last two need a memory card to install, merging the phone memory with the memory card and thus making the external VGA camera unusable when using these updates, since the camera connects via the SD slot. Because of how the camera connects, there is much debate if the slot supports SDIO. It is generally believed that it has some kind of hardware support for IO devices but the lack of drivers for the MPx200 does not permit the use of this function for other possible addons. 

There are various complaints pointing that certain brands of 512 MB memory cards can cause conflicts and corrupted data in both the phone and the memory card, so it is best to avoid that memory card size.

<doc id="640040" wikidata="Q163904" url="?curid=640040" title="10.5 (miniseries)">
<text>10.5 is a 2004 American disaster film directed by John Lafia which aired as a television miniseries in the United States on May 2, 2004, and May 3, 2004 on NBC. The plot focuses on a series of catastrophic earthquakes along the United States west coast, culminating in one measuring 10.5 on the Richter scale.

&quot;10.5&quot; was widely ridiculed by both reviewers and geologists; nevertheless, it received respectable Nielsen ratings.

The first part of the miniseries aired on May 2, 2004, and the second one aired on May 3. A sequel, &quot;10.5: Apocalypse,&quot; was aired on May 21, 2006, and May 23, 2006.

==Plot==

===Part 1===
The film begins in the Seattle, Washington area with increasingly severe earthquake activity. A quake of magnitude 7.9 is measured at the Earthquake centre, where Dr. Samantha Hill takes command, displacing Dr. Jordan Fisher. U.S. President Paul Hollister and FEMA Director Roy Nolan are informed about the situation.

A magnitude 8.4 earthquake opens a crack which engulfs an entire train east of Redding, California. As a result, Governor Carla Williams, who has just seen her daughter and ex-husband off on a camping trip, agrees to help the Governor of Washington. Amanda Williams and her father Clark Williams arrive at a town named Browning, where everything is covered in a thick red haze. They discover a car with a dead family inside, and are nearly trapped in quicksand.

Roy Nolan constructs a task force of the best geologists and seismologists, including Dr. Fisher and Dr. Hill. Dr. Hill mentions her Hidden Fault theory and is eventually given permission to prove it. She and Dr. Fisher visit a lake, where they see some animals that died from carbon monoxide poisoning and are almost poisoned themselves.

Back at the Task Force Center, Dr. Hill predicts that the next quake will be near San Francisco, California. It is deemed too risky to evacuate the entirety of San Francisco, which is eventually devastated by a 9.2 magnitude earthquake. After that, Dr. Hill predicts the next quake will happen at the San Andreas fault, which would wipe out the West Coast in its present shape killing 50 million people on the way. Dr. Hill hypothesizes that they could &quot;weld&quot; the fault shut by letting it experience immense heat, which could only be created with nuclear bombs.

===Part 2===
The President, after some deliberation, follows Nolan&#x27;s advice to execute Dr. Hill&#x27;s plan and allows the placement of the nuclear warheads. Additionally, he gives the order to evacuate the entire West Coast in case it fails and mobilizes all resources available for it.

Five of the six nuclear bombs have been successfully installed, but during the installation of the sixth, an earthquake occurs, and a warhead is lost. Nolan tries to set it manually, but is pinned by the warhead.

The Williams find a truck carrying survivors, and they are transported to Tent City, which has been set up for the refugees. In a wounded San Francisco, Carla Williams and her assistant Rachel are trapped under a wall. Carla survives, but Rachel is killed.

Deciding that nothing can be done about the lost sixth warhead, Dr. Hill decides to continue with the fault welding plan and detonate the first five. The sixth is activated by Nolan who manages to reach the control panel just in time, but is himself vaporized.

It seems to work, until Dr. Hill, concerned about southern California, observes a river flowing backwards, draining into the open fault. The last warhead was not deep enough when it exploded and Southern California is still in danger. Shortly after, a massive earthquake occurs. Eventually, the crack reaches Tent City and peaks at 10.5. When the earthquake stops, the survivors see that the southwestern coast of California has been cut away, forming a new island.

It was awarded the &quot;Award of Distinction&quot; from the Australian Cinematographers Society in the category of &quot;Telefeatures, TV Drama &amp; Mini Series&quot;.

In response to the airing of &quot;10.5&quot;, the Southern California Earthquake Center added a section to their website about the science depicted in the film. Referring to it as &quot;a miniseries with major errors&quot;, the site lists various events that occur during the film and explains why they are incorrect.
