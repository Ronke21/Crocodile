<doc id="648403" wikidata="Q2495510" url="?curid=648403" title="Battle of Reval">
<text>The naval Battle of Reval took place on during the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790), off the port of Reval in the roadstead (now Tallinn, Estonia). This battle ended in an imposing Imperial Russian Navy&#x27;s victory; it has been compared to the practice of running the gauntlet.

==Origins== 
Undaunted by the Swedish defeats and failures during 1789, the Swedish king, Gustav III, sent the battle fleet under his brother Prince Charles, Duke of Södermanland, to eliminate Admiral Chichagov&#x27;s Russian squadron, which had wintered in the harbor at Reval.

General-Admiral Duke Karl of Södermanland approached Reval with 26 ships of the line and large frigates mounting a combined 1,680 cannon. Chichagov, preparing to meet the enemy in the harbour, formed a battle line made up of 9 ships of the line and the frigate &quot;Venus&quot;.

==Battle==
The Russian fleet (10 ships of the line, 5 frigates) was anchored in a line going from Reval harbour towards the Viimsi (Wims) peninsula. The first line consisted of nine ships of the line and frigates, i.e. the 100-gun battleships &quot;Rostislav&quot; (flagship of admiral Vasili Chichagov, captained by his son Pavel Chichagov) and &quot;Saratov&quot; (flagship of vice admiral Alexey Vasilyevich Musin-Pushkin, captained by Nikolai Barsch), the 74-gun ships of the line &quot;Kir Ioann&quot;, &quot;Mstislav&quot;, &quot;Sv. Elena&quot; (flagship of contre-admiral Pyotr Khanykov, captained by Carl Magnus von Breyer) and &quot;Yaroslav&quot;, the 66-gun ships of the line &quot;Pobedonosets&quot;, &quot;Boleslav&quot; and &quot;Izyaslav&quot; and the 40-gun frigate &quot;Venus&quot; (captained by Robert Crown). In the second line, four frigates - &quot;Podrazhislav&quot; (32 guns), &quot;Slava&quot; (32), &quot;Nadezhda Blagopoluchiya&quot; (32) and &quot;Pryamislav&quot; (36). Two bomb-vessels were deployed on the flanks. The third line was composed of seven cutters.

The Swedish fleet under the command of General-Admiral Duke Karl consisted of 22 ships of the line, four frigates and four smaller vessels. It entered the harbour and started passing by the anchored Russian ships.

Due to strong winds and inaccurate aiming, most Swedish projectiles ricocheted past their targets, while the Russian ships that were anchored within the protected area of the harbour were able to use their guns much more effectively. The ship of the Swedish General-Admiral, which could not be brought into the wind due to a rigging problem, was forced to drift towards &quot;Rostislav&quot; and received major damage from grapeshot. The 64-gun battleship &quot;Prins Karl&quot;, fifteenth the Swedish line, lost her rudder to Russian fire and had to strike her colours.

The Duke of Södermanland directed the battle from the frigate &quot;Ulla Fersen&quot;, beyond the range of Russian fire. After a two-hour artillery duel he ordered his ships to break off the engagement; hence the last ten ships of Swedish line veered off without firing a shot. The Swedish ship &quot;Riksens Ständer&quot; hit the reef north of Aegna (Wolf) island. Swedish attempts to dislodge her failed, and the Swedes were forced to burn her so that the Russians would be unable to take her.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Reval was a resounding Russian victory. The Swedes lost two ships of the line, and were forced to retreat despite their more than twofold numerical superiority in line ships. Russian losses were 8 killed and 27 injured. Contemporary sources reported Russian casualties of 4 killed, 7 seriously and 18 lightly wounded, with almost 400 Swedish sailors, soldiers and officers captured and presumably 130 killed.

After the battle the Swedish fleet partially repaired at the sea, and then sailed away east of Hogland Island.

<doc id="648405" wikidata="Q338199" url="?curid=648405" title="Late Cretaceous">
<text>The Late Cretaceous (100.5–66 Ma) is the more recent of two epochs into which the Cretaceous Period is divided in the geologic time scale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous Series. The Cretaceous is named after , the Latin word for the white limestone known as chalk. The chalk of northern France and the white cliffs of south-eastern England date from the Cretaceous Period.

==Climate==

During the Late Cretaceous, the climate was warmer than present, although throughout the period a cooling trend is evident. The tropics became restricted to equatorial regions and northern latitudes experienced markedly more seasonal climatic conditions.

==Geography==
Due to plate tectonics, the Americas were gradually moving westward, causing the Atlantic Ocean to expand. The Western Interior Seaway divided North America into eastern and western halves; Appalachia and Laramidia. India maintained a northward course towards Asia. In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia and Antarctica seem to have remained connected and began to drift away from Africa and South America. Europe was an island chain. Populating some of these islands were endemic dwarf dinosaur species.

==Vertebrate fauna==

===Non-avian dinosaurs===

In the Late Cretaceous, the hadrosaurs, ankylosaurs, and ceratopsians experienced success in Asiamerica (Western North America and eastern Asia). Tyrannosaurs dominated the large predator niche in North America. They were also present in Asia, although were usually smaller and more primitive than the North American varieties. Pachycephalosaurs were also present in both North America and Asia. Dromaeosaurids shared the same geographical distribution, and are well documented in both Mongolia and Western North America. Additionally therizinosaurs (known previously as segnosaurs) appear to have been in North America and Asia. Gondwana held a very different dinosaurian fauna, with most predators being abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids; and titanosaurs being among the dominant herbivores.
Spinosaurids were also present during this time.

===Birds (avian dinosaurs)===
Birds became increasingly common, diversifying in a variety of enantiornithe and ornithurine forms. Early Neornithes such as &quot;Vegavis&quot; co-existed with forms as bizarre as &quot;Yungavolucris&quot; and &quot;Avisaurus&quot;. Though mostly small, marine Hesperornithes became relatively large and flightless, adapted to life in the open sea.

===Pterosaurs===
Though primarily represented by azhdarchids, other forms like pteranodontids, tapejarids (&quot;Caiuajara&quot; and &quot;Bakonydraco&quot;), nyctosaurids and uncertain forms (&quot;Piksi&quot;, &quot;Navajodactylus&quot;) are also present. Historically, it has been assumed that pterosaurs were in decline due to competition with birds, but it appears that neither group overlapped significantly ecologically, nor is it particularly evident that a true systematic decline was ever in place, especially with the discovery of smaller pterosaur species.

===Mammals===
Several old mammal groups began to disappear, with the last eutriconodonts occurring in the Campanian of North America. In the northern hemisphere, cimolodont, multituberculates, metatherians and eutherians were the dominant mammals, with the former two groups being the most common mammals in North America. In the southern hemisphere there was instead a more complex fauna of dryolestoids, gondwanatheres and other multituberculates and basal eutherians; monotremes were presumably present, as was the last of the haramiyidans, &quot;Avashishta&quot;.

Mammals, though generally small, ranged into a variety of ecological niches, from carnivores (Deltatheroida), to mollusc-eater (Stagodontidae), to herbivores (multituberculates, &quot;Schowalteria&quot;, Zhelestidae and Mesungulatidae) to highly atypical cursorial forms (Zalambdalestidae, Brandoniidae).

True placentals evolved only at the very end of the epoch; the same can be said for true marsupials. Instead, nearly all known eutherian and metatherian fossils belong to other groups.

===Marine life===
In the seas, mosasaurs suddenly appeared and underwent a spectacular evolutionary radiation. Modern sharks also appeared and penguin-like polycotylid plesiosaurs (3 meters long) and huge long-necked elasmosaurs (13 meters long) also diversified. These predators fed on the numerous teleost fishes, which in turn evolved into new advanced and modern forms (Neoteleostei). Ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, on the other hand, became extinct during the Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event.

==Flora==
Near the end of the Cretaceous Period, flowering plants diversified. In temperate regions, familiar plants like magnolias, sassafras, roses, redwoods, and willows could be found in abundance.

==Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction discovery==

The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time, approximately (Ma). It is widely known as the &quot;K–T extinction event&quot; and is associated with a geological signature, usually a thin band dated to that time and found in various parts of the world, known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary). &quot;K&quot; is the traditional abbreviation for the Cretaceous Period derived from the German name &quot;Kreidezeit&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; is the abbreviation for the Tertiary Period (a historical term for the period of time now covered by the Paleogene and Neogene periods). The event marks the end of the Mesozoic Era and the beginning of the Cenozoic Era. &quot;Tertiary&quot; being no longer recognized as a formal time or rock unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the K-T event is now called the Cretaceous—Paleogene (or K-Pg) extinction event by many researchers.

Non-avian dinosaur fossils are found only below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary and became extinct immediately before or during the event. A very small number of dinosaur fossils have been found above the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, but they have been explained as reworked fossils, that is, fossils that have been eroded from their original locations and then preserved in later sedimentary layers. Mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs and many species of plants and invertebrates also became extinct. Mammalian and bird clades passed through the boundary with few extinctions, and evolutionary radiation from those Maastrichtian clades occurred well past the boundary. Rates of extinction and radiation varied across different clades of organisms.

Many scientists hypothesize that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinctions were caused by catastrophic events such as the massive asteroid impact that caused the Chicxulub crater, in combination with increased volcanic activity, such as that recorded in the Deccan Traps, both of which have been firmly dated to the time of the extinction event. In theory, these events reduced sunlight and hindered photosynthesis, leading to a massive disruption in Earth&#x27;s ecology. A much smaller number of researchers believe the extinction was more gradual, resulting from slower changes in sea level or climate.

<text>The glomerulus (: glomeruli) is a network of small blood vessels (capillaries) known as a &quot;tuft&quot;, located at the beginning of a nephron in the kidney. Each of the two kidneys contains about one million nephrons. The tuft is structurally supported by the mesangium (the space between the blood vessels), composed of intraglomerular mesangial cells. The blood is filtered across the capillary walls of this tuft through the glomerular filtration barrier, which yields its filtrate of water and soluble substances to a cup-like sac known as Bowman&#x27;s capsule. The filtrate then enters the renal tubule of the nephron.

The glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal arterial circulation. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration.

The glomerulus and its surrounding Bowman&#x27;s capsule constitute a renal corpuscle, the basic filtration unit of the kidney. The rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli, and thus the measure of the overall kidney function, is the glomerular filtration rate.

==Structure==
The glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries located within Bowman&#x27;s capsule within the kidney. Glomerular mesangial cells structurally support the tufts. Blood enters the capillaries of the glomerulus by a single arteriole called an afferent arteriole and leaves by an efferent arteriole. The capillaries consist of a tube lined by endothelial cells with a central lumen. The gaps between these endothelial cells are called fenestrae. The walls have a unique structure: there are pores between the cells that allow water and soluble substances to exit and after passing through the glomerular basement membrane and between digitating podocyte foot processes, enter the capsule as ultrafiltrate.

===Lining===

Capillaries of the glomerulus are lined by endothelial cells. These contain numerous pores—also called fenestrae—, 50–100 nm in diameter. Unlike those of other capillaries with fenestrations, these fenestrations are not spanned by diaphragms. They allow for the filtration of fluid, blood plasma solutes and protein, while at the same time preventing the filtration of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

The glomerulus has a glomerular basement membrane sandwiched between the glomerular capillaries and the podocytes. It consists mainly of laminins, type IV collagen, agrin, and nidogen, which are synthesized and secreted by both endothelial cells and podocytes. The glomerular basement membrane is 250–400 nm in thickness, which is thicker than basement membranes of other tissue. It is a barrier to blood proteins such as albumin and globulin.

The part of the podocyte in contact with the glomerular basement membrane is called a &quot;podocyte foot process&quot; or &quot;pedicle&quot; (Fig. 3): there are gaps between the foot processes through which the filtrate flows into Bowman&#x27;s capsule. The space between adjacent podocyte foot processes is spanned by slit diaphragms consisting of a mat of proteins, including podocin and nephrin. In addition, foot processes have a negatively charged coat (glycocalyx) that repels negatively charged molecules such as serum albumin.

===Mesangium===
The mesangium is a space which is continuous with the smooth muscles of the arterioles. It is outside the capillary lumen but surrounded by capillaries. It is in the middle (meso) between the capillaries (angis). It is contained by the basement membrane, which surrounds both the capillaries and the mesangium.

The mesangium contains mainly:
* Intraglomerular mesangial cells. They are not part of the filtration barrier but are specialized pericytes that participate in the regulation of the filtration rate by contracting or expanding: they contain actin and myosin filaments to accomplish this. Some mesangial cells are in physical contact with capillaries, whereas others are in physical contact with podocytes. There is two-way chemical cross talk among the mesangial cells, the capillaries, and the podocytes to fine-tune the glomerular filtration rate.
* &quot;Mesangial matrix&quot;, an amorphous basement membrane-like material secreted by the mesangial cells.

===Blood supply===
The glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal arterial circulation. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration.

Blood exits the glomerular capillaries by an efferent arteriole instead of a venule, as is seen in the majority of capillary systems (Fig. 4). This provides tighter control over the blood flow through the glomerulus, since arterioles dilate and constrict more readily than venules, owing to their thick circular smooth muscle layer (tunica media). The blood exiting the efferent arteriole enters a renal venule, which in turn enters a renal interlobular vein and then into the renal vein.

Cortical nephrons near the corticomedullary junction (15% of all nephrons) are called juxtamedullary nephrons. The blood exiting the efferent arterioles of these nephrons enter the vasa recta, which are straight capillary branches that deliver blood to the renal medulla. These vasa recta run adjacent to the descending and ascending loop of Henle and participate in the maintenance of the medullary countercurrent exchange system.

===Filtrate drainage===
The filtrate that has passed through the three-layered filtration unit enters Bowman&#x27;s capsule. From there, it flows into the renal tubule—the nephron—which follows a U-shaped path to the collecting ducts, finally exiting into a renal calyx as urine.

==Function==
===Filtration===

The main function of the glomerulus is to filter plasma to produce glomerular filtrate, which passes down the length of the nephron tubule to form urine. The rate at which the glomerulus produces filtrate from plasma (the glomerular filtration rate) is much higher than in systemic capillaries because of the particular anatomical characteristics of the glomerulus. Unlike systemic capillaries, which receive blood from high-resistance arterioles and drain to low-resistance venules, glomerular capillaries are connected in both ends to high-resistance arterioles: the afferent arteriole, and the efferent arteriole. This arrangement of two arterioles in series determines the high hydrostatic pressure on glomerular capillaries, which is one of the forces that favor filtration to Bowman&#x27;s capsule.

If a substance has passed through the glomerular capillary endothelial cells, glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes, then it enters the lumen of the tubule and is known as glomerular filtrate. Otherwise, it exits the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and continues circulation as discussed below and as shown on the picture.

====Permeability====
The structures of the layers determine their permeability-selectivity (&quot;permselectivity&quot;). The factors that influence permselectivity are the negative charge of the basement membrane and the podocytic epithelium, as well as the effective pore size of the glomerular wall (8 nm). As a result, large and/or negatively charged molecules will pass through far less frequently than small and/or positively charged ones. For instance, small ions such as sodium and potassium pass freely, while larger proteins, such as hemoglobin and albumin have practically no permeability at all.

The oncotic pressure on glomerular capillaries is one of the forces that resist filtration. Because large and negatively charged proteins have a low permeability, they cannot filtrate easily to Bowman&#x27;s capsule. Therefore, the concentration of these proteins tends to increase as the glomerular capillaries filtrate plasma, increasing the oncotic pressure along the glomerular capillary.

====Starling equation====
The rate of filtration from the glomerulus to Bowman&#x27;s capsule is determined (as in systemic capillaries) by the Starling equation:

:formula_1
* is the glomerular filtration rate
* is the filtration coefficient—a proportionality constant
* is the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure
* is the Bowman&#x27;s capsule hydrostatic pressure
* is the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure
* is the Bowman&#x27;s capsule oncotic pressure

===Blood pressure regulation===
The walls of the afferent arteriole contain specialized smooth muscle cells that synthesize renin. These juxtaglomerular cells play a major role in the renin–angiotensin system, which helps regulate blood volume and pressure.

==Clinical significance==

Damage to the glomerulus by disease can allow passage through the glomerular filtration barrier of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and blood proteins such as albumin and globulin. Underlying causes for glomerular injury can be inflammatory, toxic or metabolic. These can be seen in the urine (urinalysis) on microscopic and chemical (dipstick) examination. Glomerular diseases include diabetic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis (inflammation), glomerulosclerosis (hardening of the glomeruli), and IgA nephropathy.

Due to the connection between the glomerulus and the glomerular filtration rate, the glomerular filtration rate is of clinical significance when suspecting a kidney disease, or when following up a case with known kidney disease, or when risking a development of renal damage such as beginning medications with known nephrotoxicity.

==History==
In 1666, Italian biologist and anatomist Marcello Malpighi first described the glomeruli and demonstrated their continuity with the renal vasculature (281,282). About 175 years later, surgeon and anatomist William Bowman elucidated in detail the capillary architecture of the glomerulus and the continuity between its surrounding capsule and the proximal tubule.

<text>Seeed is a German hip hop, reggae and dancehall band based in Berlin. Founded in 1998, they have become well known in Germany and its neighboring countries.

== Musical style and lyrics ==
Seeed consists of eleven band members, including three singers, a horn section and a DJ. Seeed is recognized for their catchy fusional mix of German hip hop, reggae and dancehall styles and their use of horns, which is unusual in contemporary popular music. They have worked with Cee-Lo Green, Anthony B, Tanya Stephens, General Degree as well as other Jamaican artists and producers. Almost all of their music releases feature a popular guest experience. Seeed&#x27;s lyrics are in German, English and Patois. Their biggest hits in the German Sprachraum were &quot;Dickes B&quot;, &quot;Aufstehn&quot;, &quot;Ding&quot; and &quot;Music Monks&quot;. Although their lyrics are in English and German, most of the songs in German were completely translated into English for the international releases of the Albums &quot;Next!&quot; and &quot;Music Monks&quot;.

== History ==
Their first hit was &quot;Dickes B&quot;, an ode to Berlin. They won three ECHO Awards. With the international versions of &quot;Music Monks&quot; and &quot;Next!&quot;, they found broader success in Germany&#x27;s neighboring countries, especially France. After their initial success with &quot;Dickes B&quot;, in the year 2000, they released their first full-length album a few months later, in 2001: &quot;New Dubby Conquerors&quot;.

In September 2012, Seeed released their fourth studio album, &quot;Seeed&quot;, their first release in six years. In the meantime, members Peter Fox, Dellé and Demba Nabé (Boundzound) each released solo albums. The album &quot;Seeed&quot; went straight to number 1 in the German Albums Chart. It was the first time an album of Seeed achieved the top of the albums chart.

On 31 May 2018, Demba Nabé (Boundzound) died at the age of 46.

On 18 April 2019, Seeed released their first Single &quot;Ticket&quot; after Nabé&#x27;s death. The band dedicated this song to their former member.

The fifth album &quot;Bam Bam&quot; was released 4 October 2019.

<doc id="648440" wikidata="Q1246324" url="?curid=648440" title="John Evans (archaeologist)">
<text>Sir John Evans (17 November 1823 – 31 May 1908) was an English antiquarian, geologist and founder of prehistoric archaeology.

Between 1884 and 1908 he was curator of Oxford&#x27;s Ashmolean Museum, becoming the founding member of the British Academy in 1902 and professor of prehistoric archaeology at Oxford in 1909.

The John Evans collection, housed at Oxford&#x27;s Ashmolean Museum, comprises more than 12,000 objects, including a large proportion of British Palaeolithic stone tools.

==Biography==
John Evans, son of the Rev. A. B. Evans, was born at Britwell Court, Buckinghamshire. At the age of seventeen he started to work for the paper-manufacturing business of John Dickinson &amp; Co. Ltd at Nash Mills (Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire). The company had been founded by his uncle and later father-in-law John Dickinson (1782–1869), who was also its senior partner. In 1850 Evans was admitted as a partner in the company and did not retire from active management until 1885.

Apart from his managerial work John Evans was also a distinguished antiquary, archaeologist and numismatist. He was president of the following societies and institutions:

* The Society of Antiquaries, from 1885 to 1892.
* The Royal Numismatic Society, from 1874 to the time of his death.
* The Geological Society of London, from 1874 to 1876.
* The Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, from 1877 to 1879.
* The Society of Chemical Industry, from 1892 to 1893.
* The British Association for the Advancement of Science, from 1897 to 1898.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1864 and for twenty years (1878–1898) he was treasurer of the Royal Society. He was appointed High Sheriff of Hertfordshire for 1881. Also in 1881, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

As President of the Society of Antiquaries he was an &quot;ex officio&quot; trustee of the British Museum and subsequently he became a permanent trustee. His academic honors included honorary degrees from several universities and he was a corresponding member of the Institut de France. He was created a KCB (Knight of the Order of the Bath) in 1892. Most of his very large personal archaeological collection was given to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford by his son Arthur. The Anglo-Saxon jewelled &quot;Ixworth Cross&quot; and &quot;Tostock Buckle&quot; are two of the outstanding objects. His library was left to the Bodleian Library. A collection of Iron Age antiquities Evans and Sir John Lubbock excavated at the site of Hallstatt in Austria is now in the British Museum&#x27;s collection.

He lived at Britwell on Castle Hill in Berkhamsted where he died in 1908.

==Works==
He was the author of three books, in their day standards in their field:

*&quot;The Coins of the Ancient Britons&quot; (1864); 
*&quot;The Ancient Stone Implements, Weapons and Ornaments of Great Britain&quot; (1872); and 
*&quot;The Ancient Bronze Implements, Weapons and Ornaments of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (1881).

He also wrote papers on archaeological and geological subjects, notably the papers on &quot;Flint Implements in the Drift&quot; communicated in 1860 and 1862 to &quot;Archæologia&quot;.

==Family==

Evans was married three times, widowed twice, and had six children. His first wife was Harriet Ann Dickinson, daughter of John Dickinson, owner of the paper business, and Ann Dickinson, née Grover. They had five children:

* Sir Arthur John Evans (1851–1941), curator of the Ashmolean Museum and excavator of Minoan Crete.
* Lewis Evans (1853–1930), who continued the family business and collected scientific instruments that formed the core of the collection for the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. 
* (Philip) Norman Evans (1854–1893), became a chemist after working for the firm
* Alice Evans (1856–1882), married William Minet, died relatively young 
* Harriet Ann Evans (1857–1938), married a Longman of the publishing family

Harriet died on 1 January 1858 twelve days after giving birth to Harriet Ann Evans from complications of childbirth, and he married a cousin, Frances Phelps (1826–1890), the fourth daughter of Joseph Phelps and Elizabeth Phelps (née Dickinson). She died on 22 September 1890.

Then, on 9 July 1892, John married Maria Millington Lathbury (1856–1944) and they had a daughter Dame Joan Evans, a distinguished art historian of French and English medieval art. Her partly autobiographical book &quot;Time and Chance: The Story of Arthur Evans and His Forebears&quot; (1943) is an important source on her father.

<doc id="648449" wikidata="Q191754" url="?curid=648449" title="Hendaye">
<text>Hendaye (; Basque: &quot;Hendaia&quot;, ; ) is a commune in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department and Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of southwestern France. Hendaia (&quot;endai-a&quot;) apparently means ‘the baker’s peel (an oven shovel)’.
The town, Metropolitan France&#x27;s most southwesterly and a popular seaside tourist resort, stands on the right bank of the River Bidasoa – which marks the Franco-Spanish border – at the point where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean in the French Basque Country.

Hendaye has three distinguishable parts: &quot;la ville&quot; (the town), which stretches from Saint Vincent&#x27;s church to the area around the SNCF railway station and the industrial zone; &quot;la plage&quot; (the beach), the seaside quarter; and &quot;les hauteurs&quot; (the heights), the villas and camping sites on the hills between and behind the other two areas.

==History==
Hendaye acquired its independence from the Urrugne parish in 1598, when Saint Vincent&#x27;s church was built. In the Franco-Spanish War, the town was briefly occupied by the Spanish, in September 1636.

On the fortified Île des Faisans (Pheasant Island) in the river, the Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed in 1659, ending decades of intermittent war between France and Spain. Authority over the island alternates between France and Spain every six months.

All the same, the village kept being subject to destruction due to cross-border military activity. In the War of the Pyrenees (1793–1795), the village was levelled to the ground, as described in 1799 by Wilhelm von Humboldt: &quot;The settlement spreads over a rather wide area, and seems to have looked clean and pleasant time ago. Currently all the houses, but for a handful of them, lie destroyed. The empty walls can barely stand, while the ground before inhabited is covered with overgrown bush and hawthorn. Ivy creeps up the walls, out of crumbling windows the desolate ocean can be seen through the room. Shells can still be come across the street here and there, but hardly ever can one bump into a person. Most of the inhabitants either perished in the danger and helplessness of the runaway, or they scattered away to other places.&quot;

The abolition of the French provinces, the War of the Pyrenees and the end of Basque home rule in the Spanish Basque districts—customs on the Ebro river moved to the Pyrenees (1841)—broke definitely the fluent cross-border trade and natural coexistence of the Basque speaking communities around the lower Bidasoa and the Bay of Txingudi, divided as of then by a restricted Spanish-French border.

On 22 October 1863, the railway arrived in Hendaye, as the track on the Spanish side also approached the Bidasoa borderline. On 15 August 1864, the first Madrid-Paris train arrived in Hendaye, forever re-shaping the human and urban landscape of the village and prompting rapid development. Hendaye started to stand out as an international hub and a seaside resort for the elites after the model of Biarritz (1854), halfway between Donostia (San Sebastián) and Biarritz. In 1913, the Spanish Basque railway serving the coastline all the way to Donostia (later known as &quot;topo&quot;, the &#x27;mole&#x27;) arrived at Hendaye Gare.

On 23 October 1940, Ramón Serrano Súñer, Francisco Franco, Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop met in the Hendaye railway station (then in German-occupied France) to discuss Spain&#x27;s participation in World War II as part of the Axis. Franco declined Hitler&#x27;s entreaties and outlived the other fascists by avoiding war with the United Kingdom.

Hendaye was the birthplace of Martin Guerre, a French peasant of the 16th century who was at the centre of a famous case of imposture.

==Population==
==Sights==

The town square, where there is a weekly open-air market on Wednesdays, is the location of the famous seventeenth century &quot;Great Cross of Hendaye&quot;, a stone cross carved with alchemical symbols that occultists find to contain encrypted information on a future global catastrophe. The church of Saint-Vincent was built in 1598, and largely reconstructed over the centuries following fires and bombardments. Its most recent transformation was finished in 1968. The 13th-century crucifix is the principal treasure.

The ruins of the early seventeenth century fortifications, which were reinforced by Vauban in 1685, and the old cannons facing Hondarribia, are one of the features of the promenade along the Bay of Txingudi waterfront.

The seafront Château of Antoine d&#x27;Abbadie, built by the architect and theorist Eugène Viollet-le-Duc is a monument of the Gothic Revival.

The &quot;Casino&quot; building, of Neo-Moorish style, was built in 1885. It used to be occupied by a casino (hence the name), until it was moved to the quartier de Sokoburu. During the First World War, it served as a military hospital for French soldiers and then as the Portuguese Military Hospital of Hendaia, from 15 June 1918 to 23 February 1919.

The picturesque old fishing port of Caneta has views over the Bay of Txingudi to Hondarribia and the Jaizkibel, and is also the site of Pierre Loti&#x27;s house and the old customs building.

The &quot; Jumeaux&quot; rocks (&quot;Dunbarriak&quot; in Basque, literally &#x27;the bell stones&#x27;) have become somewhat emblematic to Hendaye. These two high rock stacks, which have been carved out of the cliffs by wave action, are visible from the beach or from the domaine d&#x27;Abbadia, a nature park on the edge of the commune related to the Conservatoire du littoral project.
==Culture==

===Music===
Hendaye has no specific music venues, but there are many places where bands can play. The covered pelota fronton at Belcenia has a high capacity and the basque folk band Oskorri have played here on more than one occasion. In summer, bigger bands can play in open air at the Hendaye Plage Rugby pitch. Toure Kunda, among others, have played here.
Concerts can be organised in the &quot;Cinéma les Variétés&quot;, which also has a high capacity.

===Theatre and performance===
The &quot;Cinéma les Variétés&quot; is a large classic theatre and cinema, which is a regular venue for theatre, dancing, and performance arts. There is also a cinema at Sokoburu, near the quartier de la Plage, called the &quot;Salle Antoine d&#x27;Abbadie&quot;, but it is only used on special occasions.

The &quot;Théâtre des Chimères&quot;, from Biarritz, regularly perform at Hendaye.

===Art and literature===
The &quot;Médiathèque municipale François Mitterrand&quot; is a public library offering books, magazines, films, and CDs. There is also an art gallery, which is the main one for Hendaye.

===Events===
These a few of the regular festivals in Hendaye:

;January
*Bixintxo (St Vincent)
;May
*Mai du théâtre (theatre festival throughout the month)
;June
*Fête du cidre (cider festival)
*Fête de la musique (music festival)
;July
*Fête de la Mer (festival of the Sea)
;August
*Fête Basque (basque festival)

===Gastronomy===
Most of the town&#x27;s restaurants are found in the quartier de la Plage and along the Bay of Txingudi waterfront.

Hendaye is locally well known for the quality of its txurros.

The town is an important railway junction, as Spain&#x27;s mainline trains use a broader gauge than continental Europe, with the French railway network finishing here on the banks of the Bidasoa. As well as the Gare d&#x27;Hendaye, there is also a station serving the beach quarter (&quot;Hendaye Plage&quot;) prior to the terminus, called the &quot;Gare des Deux-Jumeaux&quot;. Basque rapid transit system San Sebastián Metro linking the town to Donostia-San Sebastián gets right to Hendaye, by the SNCF station.

There has been recent controversy concerning the new LGV Sud Europe Atlantique (TGV line), which is planned to pass inland of Hendaye without stopping in or anywhere near the town itself. Most of the local population, along with that of the rest of the Côte Basque, are in favour of the TGV, but against the new line, which would destroy the surrounding countryside, bypassing the town completely. It has therefore been suggested to upgrade the present line to make it suitable for the TGV, with a stop at Hendaye station. It is argued that this would also be much less expensive, and would stimulate the local economy.

==Agglomeration==
Hendaye is part of the urban unit of Bayonne and of the communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Pays Basque. The functional area of Hendaye includes two more communes: Biriatou to the south and Urrugne to the east.

<doc id="648450" wikidata="Q2424300" url="?curid=648450" title="Rachel's Tomb">
<text>Rachel&#x27;s Tomb ( &quot;Qǝbūrat Rāḥēl&quot;; Modern &quot;Qever Raḥel;&quot; &quot;Qabr Rāḥīl&quot;) is a site revered as the burial place of the Biblical matriarch Rachel. The site is also referred to as the Bilal bin Rabah mosque (). The tomb is held in esteem by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The tomb, located at the northern entrance to the West Bank city of Bethlehem, next to the Rachel&#x27;s Tomb checkpoint, is built in the style of a traditional maqam, Arabic for shrine.

The burial place of the matriarch Rachel had a matzevah erected at the site according to ; the site was also mentioned in Muslim literature. Although the site is considered by some scholars as unlikely to be the actual site of the grave – several other sites to the north have been proposed – it is by far the most recognized candidate. The earliest extra-biblical records describing this tomb as Rachel&#x27;s burial place date to the first decades of the 4th century CE. The structure in its current form dates from the Ottoman period, and is situated in a Christian and Muslim cemetery dating from at least the Mamluk period. 

The first historically recorded pilgrimages to the site were by early Christians. Throughout history, the site was rarely considered a shrine exclusive to one religion and is described as being &quot;held in esteem equally by Jews, Muslims, and Christians&quot;. Rachel&#x27;s Tomb has been a site of Jewish pilgrimage since at least the eleventh century—possibly since ancient times—and remains a holy pilgrimage site for modern Jews. Meron Benvenisti described it as &quot;one of the cornerstones of Jewish-Israeli identity&quot;.

British Jewish financier Sir Moses Montefiore significantly expanded the building in 1841, obtaining the keys for the Jewish community while building an antechamber, including a &quot;mihrab&quot; for Muslim prayer. Following a 1929 British memorandum, in 1949 the UN ruled that the &quot;Status Quo—&quot;an arrangement approved by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin concerning rights, privileges and practices in certain Holy Places—applies to the site. According to the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the tomb was to be part of the internationally administered zone of Jerusalem, but the area was ruled by Jordan, which prohibited Jews from entering the area. Following the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the site&#x27;s position was formalized in 1995 under the Oslo II Accord in a Palestinian enclave (Area A), with a special arrangement making it subject to the security responsibility of Israel. In 2005, following Israeli approval on 11 September 2002, the Israeli West Bank barrier was built around the tomb, effectively annexing it to Jerusalem; Checkpoint 300 – also known as Rachel&#x27;s Tomb Checkpoint – was built adjacent to the site. A 2005 report from OHCHR Special Rapporteur John Dugard noted that: &quot;Although Rachel&#x27;s Tomb is a site holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, it has effectively been closed to Muslims and Christians.&quot; On October 21, 2015, UNESCO adopted a resolution reaffirming a 2010 statement that Rachel&#x27;s Tomb was &quot;an integral part of Palestine.&quot; On 22 October 2015, the tomb was separated from Bethlehem with a series of concrete barriers.

== Biblical accounts and disputed location ==
=== Northern vis-à-vis southern version ===
Biblical scholarship identifies two different traditions in the Hebrew Bible concerning the site of Rachel&#x27;s burial, respectively a northern version, locating it north of Jerusalem near Ramah, modern Al-Ram, and a southern narrative locating it close to Bethlehem. In rabbinical tradition the duality is resolved by using two different terms in Hebrew to designate these different localities. In the Hebrew version given in Genesis, Rachel and Jacob journey from Shechem to Hebron, a short distance from Ephrath, which is glossed as Bethlehem (35:16–21, 48:7). She dies on the way giving birth to Benjamin:
&quot;And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel&#x27;s grave unto this day.&quot; — Genesis 35:19–20
Tom Selwyn notes that R. A. S. Macalister, the most authoritative voice on the topography of Rachel&#x27;s tomb, advanced the view in 1912 that the identification with Bethlehem was based on a copyist&#x27;s mistake.
The Judean scribal gloss &quot;(Ephrath, ) which is Bethlehem&quot; was added to distinguish it from a similar toponym Ephrathah in the Bethlehem region. Some consider as certain, however, that Rachel&#x27;s tomb lay to the north, in Benjamite, not in Judean territory, and that the Bethlehem gloss represents a Judean appropriation of the grave, originally in the north, to enhance Judah&#x27;s prestige. At 1 Samuel 10:2, Rachel&#x27;s tomb is located in the &#x27;territory of Benjamin at Zelzah.&#x27; In the monarchic period down to the Babylonian captivity, it would follow, Rachel&#x27;s tomb was thought to lie in Ramah. The indications for this are based on 1 Sam 10:2 and Jer. 31:15, which give an alternative location north of Jerusalem, in the vicinity of ar-Ram, biblical Ramah, five miles south of Bethel. One conjecture is that before David&#x27;s conquest of Jerusalem, the ridge road from Bethel might have been called &quot;the Ephrath road&quot; (&quot;derek ’eprātāh&quot;. ; &quot;derek’eprāt,&quot; ), hence the passage in Genesis meant &#x27;the road &quot;to&quot; Ephrath or Bethlehem,&#x27; on which Ramah, if that word refers to a toponym, lay. A possible location in Ramah could be the five stone monuments north of Hizma. Known as &quot;Qubur Bene Isra&#x27;in&quot;, the largest so-called tomb of the group, the function of which is obscure, has the name &quot;Qabr Umm beni Isra&#x27;in&quot;, that is, &quot;tomb of the mother of the descendants of Israel&quot;.
=== Bethlehem structure ===
As to the structure outside Bethlehem being placed exactly over an ancient tomb, it was revealed during excavations in around 1825 that it was not built over a cavern; however, a deep cavern was discovered a small distance from the site.

== History ==
=== Byzantine period ===
Traditions regarding the tomb at this location date back to the beginning of the 4th century AD. Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Onomasticon&quot; (written before 324), the Bordeaux Pilgrim (333–334), and Jerome (404) mention the tomb as being located 4 miles from Jerusalem.

The anonymous pilgrim of Piacenza () also mentions the tomb, writing that a church had recently been erected on the site.

=== Early Muslim period ===
In the late 7th century Arculf reported a tomb &quot;of crude workmanship, without any adornment, surrounded by a stone coping&quot; marked with the name &quot;Rachel.&quot; Bede similarly describes &quot;an unopened tomb marked with the name Rachel&quot;.

During the 10th century, Muqaddasi and other geographers fail to mention the tomb, which indicates that it may have lost importance until the Crusaders revived its veneration.

=== Crusader period ===
Muhammad al-Idrisi (1154) writes, &quot;Half-way down the road [between Bethlehem and Jerusalem] is the tomb of Rachel (&quot;Rahil&quot;), the mother of Joseph and of Benjamin, the two sons of Jacob peace upon them all! The tomb is covered by twelve stones, and above it is a dome vaulted.&quot; Pseudo-Beda (12th century) similarly writes &quot;Over her tomb Jacob piled up twelve great stones for a memorial of his twelve sons. Her tomb, together with these stones, remains to this day.&quot;

Benjamin of Tudela (1169–71) and () were the first Jewish pilgrims to describe visits to the tomb. Benjamin mentioned a monument made of 11 stones and a cupola resting on four columns &quot;and all the Jews that pass by carve their names upon the stones of the monument.&quot; Benjamin and Jacob explain that the 11 stones represent the tribes of Israel, excluding the baby Benjamin, while Petachiah of Regensburg () and the &quot;student of Nachmanides&quot; (14th century) argue that Joseph did not contribute a stone either, with the 11th stone representing Jacob: &quot;The monument is of 12 (!) stones. Each stone is as wide as the grave and half as long, so that five layers of two stones each make ten. A final stone rests on top, which is as wide and as long as the grave.&quot; Already in the 11th century Tobiah ben Eliezer had written, &quot;Each son contributed one of the 11 stones.&quot; Petachiah says the stones were &quot;marble&quot; (others describe them as &quot;hewn&quot;) and that &quot;Jacob&#x27;s stone is very large, the burden of many men. The local priests tried several times to take it for use in a church, but each time they awoke to find it had returned to its place. It is engraved with &#x27;Jacob&#x27;&quot;.

=== Mamluk period ===

In 1327, Antony of Cremona referred to the cenotaph as &quot;the most wonderful tomb that I shall ever see. I do not think that with 20 pairs of oxen it would be possible to extract or move one of its stones.&quot; A Jewish pilgrimage guide (before 1341) describes a large dome, open on all four sides, with ten stones &quot;ten fingers long&quot; topped by one &quot;sixteen fingers long&quot; (diagram left). Nicolas of Poggibonsi (1346–50) describes the grave, including the &quot;twelve stones&quot;, as 7 feet high and enclosed by a rounded tomb with three gates.

In the 15th century, if not earlier, the tomb was &quot;appropriated by the Muslims&quot; and rebuilt. 

The Russian deacon Zosimus describes a &quot;Saracen mosque&quot; in 1421, and John Poloner describes a &quot;Saracen building&quot; in 1422. A guide published in 1467 credits Shahin al-Dhahiri (1410-1470) with the building of a cupola, cistern and drinking fountain at the site. The Muslim rebuilding of the &quot;dome on four columns&quot; was also mentioned by Francesco Suriano in 1485. Felix Fabri (1480–83) described it as being &quot;a lofty pyramid, built of square and polished white stone&quot;; He also noted a drinking water trough at its side and reported that &quot;this place is venerated alike by Muslims, Jews, and Christians&quot;. Bernhard von Breidenbach of Mainz (1483) described women praying at the tomb and collecting stones to take home, believing that they would ease their labour. Pietro Casola (1494) described it as being &quot;beautiful and much honoured by the Moors&quot;. Obadiah of Bertinoro (1488) writes that &quot;There is a round dome built upon it but it does not look old to me.&quot; Mujir al-Din al-&#x27;Ulaymi (1495), the Jerusalemite &quot;qadi&quot; and Arab historian, writes under the heading of &quot;Qoubbeh Râhîl&quot; (&quot;Dome of Rachel&quot;) that Rachel&#x27;s tomb lies under this dome on the road between Bethlehem and Bayt Jala and that the edifice is turned towards the &quot;Sakhrah&quot; (the rock inside the Dome of the Rock) and widely visited by pilgrims. 

Noe Bianco (1527) describes &quot;three beautiful domes, each with four columns&quot;.

=== Ottoman period ===
==== Seventeenth century ====
According to legend, Mehmet Pasha of Jerusalem repaired the structure in 1625 and granted exclusive access to Jews. A 1636 book says that Mehmet favored Jewish settlement in Jerusalem in 1625, and Samuel ben David, a Karaite from Crimea, reported in 1642 that &quot;Mehmet Pasha built a beautiful &quot;qubba&quot; building over her tomb, as graceful as a dove in flight.&quot; In 1626, Franciscus Quaresmius visited the site and &quot;heard from the elders that the tomb had sometime collapsed, but that it was continually restored in her memory and thus retained its dignity . . . on the front of the tomb, facing the road, is an inscription, but I could not determine the language&quot;.

George Sandys wrote in 1632 that “The sepulchre of Rachel... is mounted on a square... within which another sepulchre is used for a place of prayer by the Mohometans&quot;.

Moses Poryat of Prague (1650) described a high dome, one side opening to a walled courtyard, and Jewish ritual observance:

According to Giovanni Mariti, Mehmed IV &quot;entertained a peculiar veneration for this sepulchre, and in the year 1679 sent orders for its being repaired . . . it was perhaps entirely rebuilt by Mehmed IV in 1679&quot;.

==== Eighteenth century ====
Gedaliah of Siemiatycze, who lived in Jerusalem from 1700 to 1706, writes that &quot;Wayfarers rest at the tomb to avoid the sun in summer and the rain in winter. And every year in Elul, the prince of the Sephardim goes there with other eminences and sleeps there and learns all night, taking with him Arabs for protection.&quot; According to Richard Pococke, the arches had &quot;lately been filled up to hinder the Jews from going into it&quot; as of 4 April, 1738. In March 1756, the Istanbul Jewish Committee for the Jews of Palestine instructed that 500 kuruş used by the Jews of Jerusalem to fix a wall at the tomb were to be repaid and used instead for more deserving causes. On 25 April, 1767 Giovanni Mariti visited, finding the site &quot;almost ruined&quot; but the arches &quot;open from top to bottom&quot;. Mariti apparently penetrated the sarcophagus and writes that it is completely empty. Moses of Jerusalem wrote (Amsterdam, 1769) that &quot;The tomb is closed. The building has three windows and to enter one must pay an Arab attendant,&quot; but this author may have relied on old reports. Eugene Hoade says that the arches were re-walled in 1788. Nachmu ben Solomon, a Karaite from Kale, reported in 1795 &quot;we entered the &quot;qubba&quot; and said the appropriate prayers . . . the &quot;qubba&quot; is extremely large and tall.&quot;

Pococke reports that the site was highly regarded by Turks as a place of burial, and that the ground had been raised by the number of graves. According to Mariti, the early-modern outbuildings were locals&#x27; tombs. 

==== Nineteenth century ====

In 1806 François-René Chateaubriand described it as &quot;a square edifice, surmounted with a small dome: it enjoys the privileges of a mosque, for the Turks as well as the Arabs, honour the families of the patriarchs. [..] it is evidently a Turkish edifice, erected in memory of a santon.

An 1824 report described &quot;a stone building, evidently of Turkish construction, which terminates at the top in a dome. Within this edifice is the tomb. It is a pile of stones covered with white plaster, about 10 feet long and nearly as high. The inner wall of the building and the sides of the tomb are covered with Hebrew names, inscribed by Jews.&quot;

When the structure was undergoing repairs in around 1825, excavations at the foot of the monument revealed that it was not built directly over an underground cavity. However, a small distance from the site, an unusually deep cavern was discovered.

Proto-Zionist banker Sir Moses Montefiore visited Rachel&#x27;s Tomb together with his wife on their first visit to the Holy Land in 1828. The couple were childless, and Lady Montefiore was deeply moved by the tomb, which was in good condition at that time. Before the couple&#x27;s next visit, in 1839, the Galilee earthquake of 1837 had heavily damaged the tomb. In 1838 the tomb was described as &quot;merely an ordinary Muslim Wely, or tomb of a holy person; a small square building of stone with a dome, and within it a tomb in the ordinary Muhammedan form; the whole plastered over with mortar. It is neglected and falling to decay; though pilgrimages are still made to it by the Jews. The naked walls are covered with names in several languages; many of them Hebrew.&quot;


In 1841, Montefiore renovated the site and obtained for the Jews the key of the tomb. He renovated the entire structure, reconstructing and re-plastering its white dome, and added an antechamber, including a mihrab for Muslim prayer, to ease Muslim fears. Professor Glenn Bowman notes that some writers have described this as a “purchase” of the tomb by Montefiore, asserting that this was not the case.

In 1843, Ridley Haim Herschell described the building as an ordinary Muslim tomb. He reported that Jews, including Montefiore, were obliged to remain outside the tomb, and prayed at a hole in the wall, so that their voices enter into the tomb. In 1844, William Henry Bartlett referred to the tomb as a &quot;Turkish Mosque&quot;, following a visit to the area in 1842.

In 1845, Montefiore made further architectural improvements at the tomb. He extended the building by constructing an adjacent vaulted ante-chamber on the east for Muslim prayer use and burial preparation, possibly as an act of conciliation. The room included a &quot;mihrab&quot; facing Mecca.

In the mid-1850s, the marauding Arab et-Ta&#x27;amreh tribe forced the Jews to furnish them with an annual £30 payment to prevent them from damaging the tomb.

According to Elizabeth Anne Finn, wife of the British consul, James Finn, the only time the Sephardic Jewish community left the Old City of Jerusalem was for monthly prayers at &quot;Rachel&#x27;s Sepulchre&quot; or Hebron.

In 1864, the Jews of Bombay donated money to dig a well. Although Rachel&#x27;s Tomb was only an hour and a half walk from the Old City of Jerusalem, many pilgrims found themselves very thirsty and unable to obtain fresh water. Every &quot;Rosh Chodesh&quot; (beginning of the Jewish month), the Maiden of Ludmir would lead her followers to Rachel&#x27;s tomb and lead a prayer service with various rituals, which included spreading out requests of the past four weeks over the tomb. On the traditional anniversary of Rachel&#x27;s death, she would lead a solemn procession to the tomb where she chanted psalms in a night-long vigil.

In 1868 a publication by the Catholic missionary society the Paulist Fathers noted that &quot;[Rachel&#x27;s] memory has always been held in respect by the Jews and Christians, and even now the former go there every Thursday, to pray and read the old, old history of this mother of their race. When leaving Bethlehem for the fourth and last time, after we had passed the tomb of Rachel, on our way to Jerusalem, Father Luigi and I met a hundred or more Jews on their weekly visit to the venerated spot.&quot;

The Hebrew monthly &quot;ha-Levanon&quot; of August 19, 1869, rumored that a group of Christians had purchased land around the tomb and were in the process of demolishing Montefiore&#x27;s vestibule in order to erect a church there. During the following years, land in the vicinity of the tomb was acquired by Nathan Straus. In October 1875, Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer purchased three dunams of land near the tomb intending to establish a Jewish farming colony there. Custody of the land was transferred to the Perushim community in Jerusalem. In the 1883 volume of the PEF Survey of Palestine, Conder and Kitchener noted: &quot;A modern Moslem building stands over the site, and there are Jewish graves near it... The court... is used as a praying-place by Moslems... The inner chambers... are visited by Jewish men and women on Fridays.&quot;

==== Twentieth century ====
In 1912 the Ottoman Government permitted the Jews to repair the shrine itself, but not the antechamber. In 1915 the structure had four walls, each about 7 m (23 ft.) long and 6 m (20 ft.) high. The dome, rising about 3 m (10 ft.), &quot;is used by the Moslems for prayer; its holy character has hindered them from removing the Hebrew letters from its walls.&quot;

=== British Mandate period ===

Three months after the British occupation of Palestine the whole place was cleaned and whitewashed by the Jews without protest from the Muslims. However, in 1921 when the Chief Rabbinate applied to the Municipality of Bethlehem for permission to perform repairs at the site, local Muslims objected. In view of this, the High Commissioner ruled that, pending appointment of the Holy Places Commission provided for under the Mandate, all repairs should be undertaken by the Government. However, so much indignation was caused in Jewish circles by this decision that the matter was dropped, the repairs not being considered urgent. In 1925 the Sephardic Jewish community requested permission to repair the tomb. The building was then made structurally sound and exterior repairs were effected by the Government, but permission was refused by the Jews (who had the keys) for the Government to repair the interior of the shrine. As the interior repairs were unimportant, the Government dropped the matter, in order to avoid controversy. In 1926 Max Bodenheimer blamed the Jews for letting one of their holy sites appear so neglected and uncared for.

During this period, both Jews and Muslims visited the site. From the 1940s, it came to be viewed as a symbol of the Jewish people&#x27;s return to Zion, to its ancient homeland, For Jewish women, the tomb was associated with fertility and became a place of pilgrimage to pray for successful childbirth. Depictions of the Tomb of Rachel have appeared in Jewish religious books and works of art. Muslims prayed inside the mosque there and the cemetery at the tomb was the main Muslim cemetery in the Bethlehem area. The building was also used for Islamic funeral rituals. It is reported that Jews and Muslims respected each other and accommodated each other&#x27;s rituals.
During the riots of 1929, violence hampered regular visits by Jews to the tomb. Both Jews and Muslims demanded control of the site, with the Muslims claiming it was an integral part of the Muslim cemetery within which it is situated. It also demanded a renewal of the old Muslim custom of purifying corpses in the tomb&#x27;s antechamber.

=== Jordanian period ===
Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War till 1967, the site was occupied then annexed by Jordan. the site was overseen by the Islamic waqf. On December 11, 1948, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 194 which called for free access to all the holy places in Israel and the remainder of the territory of the former Palestine Mandate of Great Britain. In April 1949, the Jerusalem Committee prepared a document for the UN Secretariat in order to establish the status of the different holy places in the area of the former British Mandate for Palestine. It noted that ownership of Rachel&#x27;s Tomb was claimed by both Jews and Muslims. The Jews claimed possession by virtue of a 1615 firman granted by the Pasha of Jerusalem which gave them exclusive use of the site and that the building, which had fallen into decay, was entirely restored by Moses Montefiore in 1845; the keys were obtained by the Jews from the last Muslim guardian at this time. The Muslims claimed the site was a place of Muslim prayer and an integral part of the Muslim cemetery within which it was situated. They stated that the Ottoman Government had recognised it as such and that it is included among the Tombs of the Prophets for which identity signboards were issued by the Ministry of Waqfs in 1898. They also asserted that the antechamber built by Montefiore was specially built as a place of prayer for Muslims. The UN ruled that the &quot;status quo&quot;, an arrangement approved by the Ottoman Decree of 1757 concerning rights, privileges and practices in certain Holy Places, apply to the site.

In theory, free access was to be granted as stipulated in the 1949 Armistice Agreements, though Israelis, unable to enter Jordan, were prevented from visiting. Non-Israeli Jews, however, continued to visit the site. During this period the Muslim cemetery was expanded.

=== Israeli control ===

Following the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied of the West Bank, which included the tomb. The tomb was placed under Israeli military administration. Prime minister Levi Eshkol instructed that the tomb be included within the new expanded municipal borders of Jerusalem, but citing security concerns, Moshe Dayan decided not to include it within the territory that was annexed to Jerusalem.

Islamic crescents, inscribed into the rooms of the structure, were subsequently erased. Muslims were prevented from using the mosque, although they were allowed to use the cemetery for a while. Starting in 1993, Muslims were barred from using the cemetery. According to Bethlehem University, &quot;[a]ccess to Rachel&#x27;s Tomb is now restricted to tourists entering from Israel.&quot;

==== Oslo negotiations: Area A and Special Security Arrangement ====

The Oslo II Accord of September 28, 1995 placed Rachel&#x27;s Tomb in a Palestinian enclave (Area A), with a special arrangement making it – together with the main Jerusalem-Bethlehem access road – subject to the security responsibility of Israel.

Initially the arrangement was intended to be the same as that for Joseph&#x27;s Tomb near Nablus; however this was reconsidered following a significant reaction from Israel’s right-wing religious parties. With the explicit intention of creating facts on the ground, in July 1995 MK Hanan Porat established a yeshiva at the tomb, and right-wing activists began trying to acquire land around the tomb to create contiguity with Israeli-annexed areas of Jerusalem. On 17 July 1995, following a meeting of Rabin’s cabinet and security forces, the Israeli position was changed to demand that an Israeli force provide security at the tomb and control the access road to it. When this demand was put to Yasser Arafat during the negotiations, he is said to have responded:

The Palestinians were also strongly against conceding control of the road linking Bethlehem to Jerusalem, but ultimately conceded in order not to threaten the overall accords.

On December 1, 1995, the rest of Bethlehem, with the sole exception of the tomb enclave, passed under the full control of the Palestinian Authority.

==== Fortification ====

In 1996, Israel began an 18-month fortification of the site at a cost of $2m. It included a wall and adjacent military post.

After an attack on Joseph&#x27;s Tomb and its subsequent takeover and desecration by Arabs, hundreds of residents of Bethlehem and the Aida refugee camp, led by the Palestinian Authority-appointed governor of Bethlehem, Muhammad Rashad al-Jabari, attacked Rachel&#x27;s Tomb. They set the scaffolding that had been erected around it on fire and tried to break in. The IDF dispersed the mob with gunfire and stun grenades, and dozens were wounded. In the following years, the Israeli-controlled site became a flashpoint between young Palestinians who hurled stones, bottles and firebombs and IDF troops, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
At the end of 2000, when the Second Intifada broke out, the tomb came under attack for 41 days. In May 2001, fifty Jews found themselves trapped inside by a firefight between the IDF and Palestinian Authority gunmen. In March 2002 the IDF returned to Bethlehem as part of Operation Defensive Shield and remained there for an extended period of time.

On 11 September 2002, the Israeli security cabinet approved incorporating the tomb on the Israeli side of the West Bank barrier and surrounded by a concrete wall and watchtowers. This has been described as &quot;de facto annexing it to Jerusalem&quot;. In February 2005, the Israel Supreme Court rejected a Palestinian appeal to change the route of the barrier in the region of the tomb. Israeli construction destroyed the Palestinian neighbourhood of &quot;Qubbet Rahil&quot; (Tomb of Rachel), which comprised 11% of metropolitan Bethlehem. Israel also declared the area to be a part of Jerusalem. From 2011, a &quot;Wall Museum&quot; was created by Palestinians on the North wall of the Israeli separation barrier surrounding Rachel&#x27;s tomb.

In February 2010, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that the tomb would become a part of the national Jewish heritage sites rehabilitation plan. The decision was opposed by the Palestinian Authority, who saw it as a political decision associated with Israel&#x27;s settlement project. The UN&#x27;s special coordinator for the Middle East, Robert Serry, issued a statement of concern over the move, saying that the site is in Palestinian territory and has significance in both Judaism and Islam. The Jordanian government said that the move would derail peace efforts in the Middle East and condemned &quot;unilateral Israeli measures which affect holy places and offend sentiments of Muslims throughout the world&quot;. UNESCO urged Israel to remove the site from its heritage list, stating that it was &quot;an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territories&quot;. A resolution was passed at UNESCO that acknowledged both the Jewish and Islamic significance of the site, describing the site as both Bilal ibn Rabah Mosque and as Rachel&#x27;s Tomb. The resolution passed with 44 countries supporting it, twelve countries abstaining, and only the United States voting to oppose. Also writing in the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, Larry Derfner defended the UNESCO position. He pointed out that UNESCO had explicitly recognized the Jewish connection to the site, having only denounced Israeli claims of sovereignty, while also acknowledging the Islamic and Christian significance of the site. The Israeli Prime Minister&#x27;s Office criticised the resolution, claiming that: &quot;the attempt to detach the Nation of Israel from its heritage is absurd. ... If the nearly 4,000-year-old burial sites of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish Nation – Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah – are not part of its culture and tradition, then what is a national cultural site?&quot;

== Jewish religious significance ==

=== Rabbinic traditions ===
In Jewish lore, Rachel died on 11 Cheshvan 1553 BCE.
* According to the Midrash, the first person to pray at Rachel&#x27;s tomb was her eldest son, Joseph. While he was being carried away to Egypt after his brothers had sold him into slavery, he broke away from his captors and ran to his mother&#x27;s grave. He threw himself upon the ground, wept aloud and cried &quot;Mother! mother! Wake up. Arise and see my suffering.&quot; He heard his mother respond: &quot;Do not fear. Go with them, and God will be with you.&quot;
* A number of reasons are given why Rachel was buried by the road side and not in the Cave of Machpela with the other Patriarchs and Matriarchs:
** Jacob foresaw that following the destruction of the First Temple the Jews would be exiled to Babylon. They would cry out as they passed her grave, and be comforted by her. She would intercede on their behalf, asking for mercy from God who would hear her prayer.
** Although Rachel was buried within the boundaries of the Holy Land, she was not buried in the Cave of Machpelah due to her sudden and unexpected death. Jacob, looking after his children and herds of cattle, simply did not have the opportunity to embalm her body to allow for the slow journey to Hebron.
** Jacob was intent on not burying Rachel at Hebron, as he wished to prevent himself feeling ashamed before his forefathers, lest it appear he still regarded both sisters as his wives – a biblically forbidden union.
* According to the mystical work, Zohar, when the Messiah appears, he will lead the dispersed Jews back to the Land of Israel, along the road which passes Rachel&#x27;s grave.

=== Location ===
Early Jewish scholars noticed an apparent contradiction in the Bible with regards to the location of Rachel&#x27;s grave. In Genesis, the Bible states that Rachel was buried &quot;on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem&quot;. Yet a reference to her tomb in Samuel states: &quot;When you go from me today, you will find two men by Rachel&#x27;s tomb, in the border of Benjamin, in Zelzah&quot; (1 Sam 10:2). Rashi asks: &quot;Now, isn&#x27;t Rachel&#x27;s tomb in the border of Judah, in Bethlehem?&quot; He explains that the verse rather means: &quot;Now they are by Rachel&#x27;s tomb, and when you will meet them, you will find them in the border of Benjamin, in Zelzah.&quot; Similarly, Ramban assumes that the site shown today near Bethlehem reflects an authentic tradition. After he had arrived in Jerusalem and seen &quot;with his own eyes&quot; that Rachel&#x27;s tomb was on the outskirts of Bethlehem, he retracted his original understanding of her tomb being located north of Jerusalem and concluded that the reference in Jeremiah (Jer 31:15) which seemed to place her burial place in Ramah, is to be understood allegorically. There remains however, a dispute as to whether her tomb near Bethlehem was in the tribal territory of Judah, or of her son Benjamin.

=== Customs ===
A Jewish tradition teaches that Rachel weeps for her children and that when the Jews were taken into exile, she wept as they passed by her grave on the way to Babylonia. Jews have made pilgrimage to the tomb since ancient times.

There is a tradition regarding the key that unlocked the door to the tomb. The key was about long and made of brass. The beadle kept it with him at all times, and it was not uncommon that someone would knock at his door in the middle of the night requesting it to ease the labor pains of an expectant mother. The key was placed under her pillow and almost immediately, the pains would subside and the delivery would take place peacefully.

Till this day there is an ancient tradition regarding a &quot;segulah&quot; or charm which is the most famous women&#x27;s ritual at the tomb. A red string is wound around the tomb seven times, then worn as a charm for fertility. This use of the string is comparatively recent, though there is a report of its use to ward off diseases in the 1880s.

The Torah Ark in Rachel&#x27;s Tomb is covered with a curtain (Hebrew: &quot;parokhet&quot;) made from the wedding gown of Nava Applebaum, a young Israeli woman who was killed by a Palestinian terrorist in a suicide bombing at Café Hillel in Jerusalem in 2003, on the eve of her wedding.

== Replicas ==

The tomb of Sir Moses Montefiore, adjacent to the Montefiore synagogue in Ramsgate, England, is a replica of Rachel&#x27;s Tomb.

In 1934, the Michigan Memorial Park planned to reproduce the tomb. When built, it was used to house the sound system and pipe organ used during funerals, but it has since been demolished.

<text>Stephen Meredith Potter (1 February 1900 – 2 December 1969) was a British writer best known for his parodies of self-help books, and their film and television derivatives.

After leaving school in the last months of the First World War he was commissioned as a junior officer in the British Army, but by the time he had completed his training the war was over and he was demobilised. He then studied English at Oxford, and after some false starts he spent his early working life as an academic, lecturing in English literature at Birkbeck College, part of the University of London, during which time he published several works on Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Finding his income inadequate to support himself and his family, he left the university and took up a post producing and writing for the BBC. He stayed with the BBC until after the Second World War, when he became a freelance writer, and remained one for the rest of his life.

His series of humorous books on how to secure an unfair advantage began in 1947 with &quot;Gamesmanship&quot;, purporting to show how poor players can beat better ones by subtle psychological ploys. This sold prodigiously and led to a series of sequels covering other aspects of life. The books were adapted for the cinema in the 1960s and for television in the 1970s.

===Early years===
Potter was born in Battersea, London, the only son of Frank Collard Potter (1858–1939), a chartered accountant, and his wife Elizabeth Mary Jubilee &quot;née&quot; Reynolds (1863–1950). He attended Westminster School from age 13 to 18, during the First World War. As he reached school-leaving age he wrote in his diary, &quot;If this war doesn&#x27;t end soon I shall have to join the beastly army and lay down my blooming life for my blinking country.&quot; He volunteered for the army, was trained as an officer and &quot;passed out&quot; (graduated) as top of his company. He was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards as a second lieutenant just as the war was ending, and did not see active service.

Potter was demobilised in 1919, and spent a few months in his father&#x27;s office learning book-keeping, before going to Merton College, Oxford, to study English. His family paid for his university education, a fact that put him in the shadow of his elder sister Muriel (later a form mistress at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, then headmistress of South Hampstead High School), who had won a scholarship to St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, and had taken a first-class degree. Potter achieved only a second-class degree in English language and literature. On the strength of this he was offered the post of talks producer at the BBC, but turned it down as it was based in the provincial city of Birmingham, where he had no wish to reside. Potter instead tried to earn a living as an elocution teacher in London, advertising &quot;Cockney accents cured&quot;, but attracted only one pupil. He then tried his luck as a tutor and schoolmaster before becoming private secretary to a well-known playwright, Henry Arthur Jones.

==Lecturer in English literature==
In 1926 Potter began teaching English literature at Birkbeck College, University of London. On 7 July 1927 he married Marian Anderson Attenborough (1900–1981), a painter professionally known as Mary Potter. There were two sons of the marriage Andrew (1928–2008) and Julian (1931–2013). The family at first lived in Chiswick, London, before moving to a flat in Harley Street.

Potter&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Young Man&quot; (1929), was an autobiographical novel, which was well-reviewed. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;a brilliant performance ... a distinguished contribution to intellectual fiction.&quot; In 1930 he wrote &quot;D. H. Lawrence: A First Study&quot;, the first book-length work on Lawrence, which appeared in print within a few days of the death of its subject; unfortunate timing, because it seemed like an inadequate memorial rather than what it was intended to be, a critical reappraisal. It also suffered from a regrettable misprint, rendering the heading &quot;Sea and Sardinia&quot;, as &quot;Sex and Sardinia&quot;. This was soon amplified by rumour into &quot;Sex and Sardines&quot;, none of which helped Potter&#x27;s reputation as a serious writer. Potter&#x27;s most comprehensive critic was the friend from whom he had inherited the Cape commission, G.B. Edwards, in Middleton Murry&#x27;s &quot;Adelphi&quot;. After this he concentrated in his next four works on Coleridge. He edited the Nonesuch Press &quot;Coleridge&quot; (1933), praised in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the best anthology that has ever shown Coleridge as poet, philosopher and critic. This was followed by an edition of Sara Coleridge&#x27;s letters to Thomas Poole, &quot;Minnow among Tritons&quot; (1934), which Potter edited from the original manuscripts in the British Museum. In 1941 he wrote a play, &quot;Married to a Genius&quot;, based on the Coleridge marriage. In 1935 he published his most important contribution to the subject, &quot;Coleridge and S.T.C.&quot;, a discussion of the duality in the poet&#x27;s nature, &quot;not merely the earlier and the later, but the true and the false, and the exciting and the nauseating,&quot; as John Middleton Murry put it in a review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. Reviews were good, but with reservations that Potter oversimplified the dichotomy in Coleridge&#x27;s nature (&quot;The Observer&quot;) or else did not explore the underlying reasons for it (&quot;TLS&quot;).

In 1937 Potter published &quot;The Muse in Chains: a Study in Education&quot;, a humorous satire on the academic teaching of English literature. G. M. Young wrote of it: &quot;if I were suddenly commissioned by some Golden Dustman to organize a new University, I think I should send for Mr. Potter and offer him the Chair of English literature forthwith.&quot; Other reviewers thought Potter&#x27;s suggestions more entertaining than practical. Potter&#x27;s humorous insights into academic life were widely praised. He wrote of George Saintsbury: &quot;It is recorded that for eighteen years he started the day by reading a French novel (in preparation for his history of them) – an act so unnatural to man as almost in itself to amount to genius.&quot;

===BBC writer and producer===
Potter first wrote for BBC radio in 1936. Finding that his academic career, although promising, was insufficiently well paid to support his family, he resigned from Birkbeck in 1937 and the following year joined the BBC as a writer-producer in its features department, originally concentrating on literary features and documentaries. In the same year he joined the Savile Club, known for its artistic and especially literary members, who have included Hardy, Kipling, and Yeats. He was a leading player of the club&#x27;s idiosyncratic version of snooker, and some of his later &quot;gamesmanship&quot; ploys are thought to have originated in the Savile&#x27;s games room.

At the outbreak of the Second World War Potter was sent by the BBC to work in Manchester. Later in the war years he and his wife moved south, living in a farmhouse in Essex where she found more scope to pursue her career as a painter. In 1943 Potter collaborated with Joyce Grenfell on a gently satirical comedy feature &quot;How to Talk to Children&quot;. It was well received and they made twenty-eight more &quot;How to ...&quot; programmes, including &quot;How to Woo&quot; and &quot;How to Give a Party&quot;. In 1946 &quot;How to Listen&quot; was the first broadcast heard on the newly created Third Programme. At the end of the war, Potter took on a number of concurrent literary tasks. These included drama critic for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and book reviewer for the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;.

===&quot;Gamesmanship&quot; and freelance writing===
A ten-day power-cut at the beginning of 1947 prevented any broadcasting and gave Potter the opportunity to dash off a book. To the despair of his publisher he was a far from methodical author: every Potter manuscript was &quot;a mass of dirty bits of paper, vilely typed, corrected in illegible biro, episodic and half-revised.&quot; This book, &quot;The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship: Or the Art of Winning Games Without Actually Cheating&quot;, illustrated by Frank Wilson, was published in 1947, and sold prodigiously.

It was the first of his series of books purporting to teach ploys for manipulating one&#x27;s associates, making them feel inferior and thus gaining the status of being one-up on them. From this book, the term &quot;Gamesmanship&quot; entered the English language. Potter said that he was introduced to the technique by C. E. M. Joad during a game of tennis in which Joad and Potter were struggling against two fit young students. Joad politely requested the students to state clearly whether a ball had landed in or out (when in truth it was so obviously out that they had not thought it necessary to say so). This nonplussed the students, who wondered if their sportsmanship was in question; they became so edgy that they lost the match. With the success of &quot;Gamesmanship&quot;, Potter left the BBC in 1949, ended his existing journalistic commitments, and briefly became editor of a weekly, &quot;Leader Magazine&quot;. The magazine closed in 1950, and thereafter he was a freelance writer for the rest of his life.

Potter followed up the success of Gamesmanship, extending the basic idea to many other aspects of life, in &quot;Some Notes on Lifemanship&quot; (1950), which was another big seller. In &quot;Lifemanship&quot; Potter extended the principles of gamesmanship to courtship (&quot;Woomanship&quot;), literature (&quot;Writermanship&quot;) and pastimes (&quot;Conversationship&quot;). Thus for example the reader is enjoined, &quot;never forget the uses of Lowbrowmanship in conversation ... LOWBROWMAN: Oh, I don&#x27;t know, I rather like a good bit of old-fashioned vulgarity. And I&#x27;m awfully sorry but I like leg shows. If the Lowbrowman happens to be a Professor of Aesthetics ... his remark is all the more irritating&quot;. A related gambit for the journalist was &#x27; &quot;Daily Mirrorship&quot; ... an unaffected love of tremendously ordinary and homely things like Danny Kaye, mild and bitter, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, the Bertram Mills circus and Rita Hayworth&quot;. Potter mentions in passing how &quot;in the last of my Bude lectures I spoke of Gamesmanship and Shakespeare, where most of my remarks referred to Footnote Play&quot;. His notes on Donmanship refer to the &quot;art of Criticising without Actually Listening&quot;.

In his notes on Woomanship, Potter expresses surprise that &quot;twelve times as many workers volunteered to send in reports on Woomanship as on any other subject&quot;. In mixed gamesmanship, for a man &quot;a good working knowledge of the Chivalry Gambit is essential&quot;; a woman&#x27;s counter to &quot;the least signs of trying the &#x27;I have long adored you from afar&#x27; move&quot;, is to &quot;treat it immediately as a formal proposal of marriage &quot;which you shyly accept&quot;. This is one of the most devastating, the most match-winning, counters in the whole realm of gamesmanship&quot;.

In 1951 Potter and his wife moved to Suffolk, to the Red House in Aldeburgh. The most famous local residents were Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears, with whom the Potters quickly became friendly. They got involved with the running of Britten&#x27;s Aldeburgh Festival, and &quot;every summer Britten, Peter Pears, and the Potters formed the nucleus of countless tennis parties on the grass court at the Red House.&quot; In 1954, Potter asked his wife for a divorce. She consented, and he moved away from Aldeburgh. Finding the Red House too large and expensive for one person, Mary Potter agreed to exchange houses with Britten and Pears, who moved into the Red House, with which they were associated for the rest of their lives and beyond. In 1955, after nearly 30 years of marriage, the Potters&#x27; divorce was finalised, and he remarried, to Heather Jenner, the founder of The Marriage Bureau. Their only child, Luke, was born the following year.

A second successor to &quot;Gamesmanship&quot; was published as &quot;One-Upmanship&quot; (1952). Potter had become well enough known overseas to be invited to give a literary lecture tour of America. He described his experiences in &quot;Potter on America&quot; (1956), which received a long and complimentary review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;: &quot;Mr. Potter&#x27;s private army of Lifemen will need no recommendation to this latest frolic ... It is a pleasure to discover or rediscover the United States in this company, for the author is the most literate of humorists.&quot;

A third sequel to &quot;Gamesmanship&quot;, was published in 1958 under the title of &quot;Supermanship&quot;. Its publisher, Rupert Hart-Davis, privately wrote of the book, &quot;&quot;Gamesmanship&quot; made me laugh a lot, and its two successors were just good enough (all three still sell prodigiously), but the world has moved (deathwards, you may say) in the last ten years, and Potter hasn&#x27;t budged an inch. In truth the joke is played out, but he won&#x27;t face the fact. This manuscript consists of a bunch of marginal articles, written during the past six years and slung together with the minimum of care.&quot; Some critics agreed. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commented, &quot;his methods and the point of view behind them don&#x27;t seem as funny or as sharp as they once did, possibly because they are no longer surprising, or possibly because he is getting a little tired of his own joke.&quot; But Edmund Wilson remained a fan of Potter, praising &quot;the brevity and compactness of the presentation. As in any practical manual, the principles are stated and concisely illustrated. Nothing goes on too long.&quot;

===Later years===
By the late 1950s the concept and the suffix &quot;-manship&quot; had entered the English language. The foreign policy of the American secretary of state John Foster Dulles was universally known as &quot;brinkmanship&quot;, and in England Prince Philip borrowed from Potter in 1957, accusing accountants of &quot;taxmanship – the art of scoring off the Inland Revenue without actually cheating&quot;. According to Joyce Grenfell, Potter had become bored with the joke by this time, &quot;but for the rest of his life he found it difficult to speak or write naturally, so accustomed had he grown to the jocose gambits and ploys of his own invention.&quot; Potter himself was aware of the pigeonhole in which he had put himself. He described himself in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1967 as &quot;one whose sole contribution to world thought has been the naming and description of the form of behaviour now known as gamesmanship&quot;. Another friend said of him, &quot;This kind of fame was not what he had hoped for. He wanted to be a great serious writer. Yet that was totally beyond him.&quot;

Potter&#x27;s last works went in new directions. In 1959 he wrote a corporate history of H.J. Heinz under the title &quot;The Magic Number&quot;, and his autobiography of his first 20 years, &quot;Steps to Immaturity&quot;. His publisher was doubtful about the latter, but it was well received. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, called it &quot;this sympathetic, beguiling book&quot; and looked forward to a sequel, and other papers from &quot;The Daily Express&quot; to &quot;The New Statesman&quot; praised it in their reviews. In 1965 when his youngest son was about 9 years old, Potter wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Squawky&quot;, illustrated by George Him, with whom he had earlier created the mythical County of Schweppshire as part of an advertising campaign for a soft-drink manufacturer. At the time of his death he was making notes on word origins from the natural world; they were posthumously edited and published in 1973 as &quot;Pedigree: Essays on the Etymology of Words from Nature&quot;.

Potter died of pneumonia in London at the age of 69.

==Adaptations and commemorations==
The 1960 film &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot; recapitulates many of the &quot;one-up&quot; ideas, and extends them to &quot;Woo-manship&quot;, meaning the art of manipulative seduction of women. The script was adapted by Peter Ustinov from Potter&#x27;s books. The film starred Ian Carmichael as the innocent in need of Professor Potter&#x27;s teaching, Alastair Sim as Potter, Terry-Thomas, Dennis Price and Peter Jones as exemplars of one-upmanship.

&quot;One-Upmanship&quot; is a British television series based on Potter&#x27;s work. It was written and adapted by Barry Took for the BBC for a Christmas special, initially in 1974. Starring Richard Briers, Peter Jones (who also played a supporting role in &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot;), and Frederick Jaeger, it was subsequently broadened into three series that were broadcast between 1976 and 1978. Details of the broadcasts can be found on this BBC comedy Web site.

Potter&#x27;s diaries, acquired by the University of Texas after his death, were a primary source for &quot;Stephen Potter at the BBC&quot; (2004) by his second son, Julian Potter, a chronicle of Potter&#x27;s time in the features department of the BBC in the 1940s.

&quot;Raffles and the Match-Fixing Syndicate&quot;, by Adam Corres, is an extension of Potter&#x27;s theories, explaining the principles of cricket gamesmanship and the psychology of &quot;thinking the batsman out&quot;. In a 1959 article Edmund Wilson wondered why Potter, as an academic himself, did not &quot;exploit the fertile field of one-upmanship among professors, whereupon Wilson proceeded to fill the gap&quot;.

In 2007, devotees of Potter created an annual winter golf tournament based on the tactics espoused in the author&#x27;s book Gamesmanship. &quot;The Potter Cup&quot; is held annually at Fenwick Golf Course in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. The Potter Cup is the Oldest Cold Weather Golf Tournament in Continuous Existence in Connecticut.

==Wider influence==
Eric Berne in his best-selling &quot;Games People Play&quot; readily acknowledges Potter&#x27;s &quot;Gamemanship&quot; as a precursor: &#x27;Due credit should be given to Stephen Potter for his perceptive, humorous discussions of manoeuvres, or &quot;ploys&quot;, in everyday social situations&#x27;. Elsewhere he calls Potter &#x27;the chief representative of the humorous exposition of ulterior transactions&#x27;.

What has been termed Potter&#x27;s &quot;blend of flat and serious tone (reminiscent of a gentlemanly sports handbook) united with a sceptical judgement of the values of the English middle-class social scene&quot; would thus seem to have fed into Berne&#x27;s own &quot;sardonically humorous &quot;Games People Play&quot; ... con-games of daily life that Dr Berne describes with desperately penetrating gallows-wit&quot;.

Potter&#x27;s &#x27; &quot;Game Leg&quot;...&quot;Limpmanship&quot;, as it used to be called, or the exact use of minor injury&#x27; precedes Berne&#x27;s &quot;Wooden Leg&quot;; Potter&#x27;s &#x27;Nice Chapmanship ... Being a Nice Chap &quot;in certain circumstances&quot; is valuable&#x27; precedes Berne&#x27;s &quot;Good Joe&quot;; Potter&#x27;s &quot;Advicemanship&quot;, whereby &#x27;if properly managed, the mere giving of advice is sufficient&#x27; to win, precedes Berne&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Only Trying to Help You&quot;, where &#x27;the damage is done while being helpful&#x27;. And &#x27;Just as there are O.K.-words in conversationship&#x27;, so too in transactional analysis there are &quot;&quot;O. K. Words&quot;: Words rewarded by parental approval ... those approved by the Parental part of the patient&#x27;s father, mother, therapist, or other parental person&quot;.

Where Potter noted that &quot;each gambit has its answer or &#x27;counterlife, Berne would note how everyone has positive forces in them &quot;counter to the plot of [their] script – a counterscript&quot;; where Potter offered &#x27;Counter Psychiatry, which is, of course, a huge subject&#x27;, Berne explored how &quot;Psychiatry as a procedure must be distinguished from &#x27;Psychiatry&#x27; as a game&quot;.

The sociologist Erving Goffman also profited from Potter&#x27;s work, in the sense that it &quot;disclose[s] an elaborate code of conventions which operated in everyday social intercourse, which was nevertheless tacit&quot;, and could be exploited by the sociologist: &quot;what Potter&#x27;s articles perhaps did, by their oblique but recognisable affinity with Goffman&#x27;s own ideas, was to provide the kind of licence or mandate&quot; Goffman needed to find his own creative approach.

<text>Koose Munusamy Veerappan (18 January 1952 – 18 October 2004) was an Indian poacher, smuggler, domestic terrorist and bandit who was active for 36 years, and kidnapped major politicians for ransom. He was charged with sandalwood smuggling and poaching of elephants in the scrub lands and forests in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. He was wanted for killing approximately 184 people, about half of whom were police officers and forest officials. He was also responsible for poaching approximately 500 of the 2000 elephants killed in the peninsular region where he was active and for smuggling ivory worth US$2.6 million (₹16 crore) and about 65 tons of sandalwood worth approximately US$22 million (₹143 crore).

The battle to capture Veerappan cost the governments of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over ₹100 crore.

==Personal life==
Veerappan was born into a Tamil family in Gopinatham, Kollegala, Coimbatore District (Madras State) now in Karnataka in 1952. In 1990, he was married to Muthulakshmi, who reportedly married him because of his &quot;notoriety and moustache&quot;. As of 2004, his two daughters, Vidya Rani (born in 1990) and Prabha (born in 1993), were studying in Tamil Nadu.
He had support from the Pattali Makkal Katchi party which openly sought for clemency on behalf of Veerappan.

== Criminal history==
Veerappan began his criminal career by assisting his uncle Saalvai Gounder, a notorious poacher and sandalwood smuggler. Veerappan initially worked as a sandalwood and ivory smuggler, killing elephants for their tusks. He later broke away from his uncle. Over the next 25 years, Veerappan and other poachers together killed 2,000 to 3,000 elephants, with Veerappan and his gang responsible for approximately 500 of them. He was first arrested in 1972.

After committing his first murder, at the age of 17, he began killing those who resisted his illegal activities. His victims tended to be police officers, forest officials, and informants.

In 1987, Veerappan kidnapped and murdered a Sathyamangalam Taluka forest officer named Chidambaram from Tamil Nadu. This brought his activities to the attention of the Indian Government.
He drew further attention by murdering a senior IFS officer, Pandillapalli Srinivas, in November 1991. Next, there was the August 1992 ambush of a police party, which included a senior IPS officer, Harikrishna.

Veerappan was not averse to killing civilians, and killed a man from his native village for traveling in a police jeep. He regularly killed anyone suspected of being a police informer. Because of political instability, Veerappan could easily escape from one state to another. State jurisdiction problems also prevented police officers from entering other states to apprehend Veerappan.

=== Palar blast ===

In Govindapadi, Mettur, Veerappan killed a Bandari person whom he suspected of being a police informer. As a result, a 41-member team of police officers and forestry officials were called in to investigate. On 9 April 1993, landmines were detonated underneath the two vehicles in which the team was traveling. The blast occurred at Palar, near Malai Mahadeswara Hills (present-day Chamarajanagar District, Karnataka) and killed 22 members of the team. Known as the Palar blast, this was Veerappan&#x27;s single largest mass killing.

=== Special Task Force ===

In 1992, the Karnataka and the Tamil Nadu Governments formed a Special Task Force to catch Veerappan. It was headed in Tamil Nadu by Sanjay Arora and in Karnataka by Shankar Bidri with Walter Devaram as the joint chief. In February 1992, his lieutenant Gurunathan was killed by the Karnataka task force, with SI Shakeel Ahmed single-handedly responsible for the capture. Three months later, Veerappan attacked the Ramapura police station in Kollegal, killing several policemen and capturing arms and ammunition. In August 1992, Veerappan laid a trap for SI Shakeel Ahmed, killing him along with five others. The Karnataka and Tamil Nadu Special Task Forces then began intensified combing operations along the two states&#x27; border areas and also around Gopinatham village, Veerappan&#x27;s birthplace.

Through these operations, under charge of Sanjay Arora and Shankar Bidari, the gang was reduced to 5 members.
Meetings with Gopinatham villagers were held, and the 5-crore bounty was announced. In 1993, the task force arrested Veerappan&#x27;s wife, Muthulakshmi, and charged her with aiding, but she was acquitted of all charges.

=== Kidnapping of Rajkumar ===

On 30 June 2000, Veerappan abducted Kannada cinema actor Rajkumar and three others from Dodda Gajanur, a village in Sathyamangalam taluk Erode district near the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border, where the film star was attending his housewarming ceremony.
Public outcry and violence ensued in Bangalore as well as other parts of Karnataka. A bandh, or strike, also occurred on 22 September in Bangalore. Karnataka&#x27;s Chief Minister and police personnel sought the help of Tamil Nadu Government and visited Chennai seeking help. Negotiations were conducted and R. Gopal, an editor of the Tamil magazine &quot;Nakkeeran&quot;, was involved in several rounds of talks with Veerappan. Gopal had earlier visited Veerappan for similar negotiations,
and visited the forest several times for videotaped discussions. Veerappan demanded justice for Tamil Nadu in the Cauvery Water dispute, as well as making Tamil the second official language of Karnataka and the release of certain Tamil political prisoners jailed in Tamil Nadu. Rajkumar was held for 108 days and finally released without harm in November 2000. A police official later revealed that 20 crore rupees had been paid by Karnataka government for his release.

=== Kidnapping of Nagappa ===

On 25 August 2002, Veerappan abducted H. Nagappa, a former minister of Karnataka, from his village in Kamagere, Chamarajanagar district. Nagappa had been a minister for Agricultural Marketing from 1996 to 1999. The Joint Special task forces of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu worked with the Kerala police to help release Nagappa.
Encounter to release him failed, and Nagappa was found dead three months later in a Karnataka forest. The reward offered by the Karnataka state government was then increased to 15 crore rupees.

=== Ransom demands ===

For several years during the 1990s, Veerappan kidnapped police officials and other personalities and demanded ransom money. It is believed that ransoms were often unofficially paid. In July 1997, he kidnapped nine forest officials in the Burude forests in Chamarajanagar district. In that case, the hostages were released unharmed a few years later even though his ransom demand was not met. It is also believed that Veerappan buried large amounts of money in various parts of the forest; in 2002 police recovered 3.3 million rupees from his gang members.

Banned organisations like the Tamil National Retrieval Troops (TNRT) and Tamil Nadu Liberation Army helped Veerappan to secure a Robin Hood image and to draft terms of negotiations when he kidnapped prominent people. Kolathur Mani, president of Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam, formerly the Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (PDK) party, was arrested and brought to trial as an accomplice in several of Veerappan&#x27;s crimes, although later acquitted due to lack of evidence.

== Death ==
On 18 October 2004, Veerappan and three of his associates were killed by the Tamil Nadu Special Task Force and N. K. Senthamarai Kannan under the leadership of K. Vijay Kumar. 
The encounter happened near the village of Papparapatti
in Dharmapuri district, Tamil Nadu. Veerappan and his men were lured into an ambulance by an undercover policeman under the pretext of taking them to Dharmapuri for medical treatment. The Tamil Nadu Special Task Force, which had been observing his movements for several months, surrounded the ambulance, and the gangsters were killed in the ensuing gunfight.

The entire operation was named Operation Cocoon. Veerappan&#x27;s associates Sethukuli Govindan, Chandre Gowdar and Sethumani were also killed in the operation.

His death was described as the &quot;death of a demon&quot;. The villagers of Gopinatham celebrated with firecrackers on hearing the news.

Several human rights activists, who rallied under the banner of the Centre for Protection of Civil Liberties (CPCL), claimed that circumstantial evidence indicated that Veerappan was murdered by police after being tortured.

Veerappan was buried at Moolakkadu near Mettur in Tamil Nadu, as his family members were more attached to it and most of his relatives in Gopinatham had left. The police had planned a cremation but decided on a burial after objections from Veerappan&#x27;s relatives. Thousands of people turned out for the burial, while others were kept away by heavy security.

== Timeline ==
==Legacy==
On April 25, 2013, the Pattali Makkal Katchi and the Vanniyar Sangam called Veerappan a youth icon at the Vanniyar Youth Cultural Festival at Mamallapuram. The incident was condemned by Jayalalithaa, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.

<text>Oppression is malicious or unjust treatment of, or exercise of power over, a group of individuals, often in the form of governmental authority. Oppression may be overt or covert, depending on how it is practiced.

No universally accepted model or terminology has yet emerged to describe oppression in its entirety, although some scholars cite evidence of different types of oppression, such as social oppression, cultural, political, religious/belief, institutional oppression, and economic oppression.

==Authoritarian oppression==
The word &quot;oppress &quot;comes from the Latin &quot;oppressus&quot;, past participle of &quot;opprimere&quot;, (&quot;to press against&quot;, &quot;to squeeze&quot;, &quot;to suffocate&quot;). Thus, when authoritarian governments use oppression to subjugate the people, they want their citizenry to feel that &quot;pressing down&quot;, and to live in fear that if they displease the authorities they will, in a metaphorical sense, be &quot;squeezed&quot; and &quot;suffocated&quot;. Such governments oppress the people using restriction, control, terror, hopelessness, and despair. The tyrant&#x27;s tools of oppression include, for example, extremely harsh punishments for &quot;unpatriotic&quot; statements; developing a secret police force; prohibiting freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press; controlling the monetary system and economy; and imprisoning or killing activists or other leaders who might pose a threat to their power.

==Socioeconomic, political, legal, cultural, and institutional oppression==
Oppression also refers to the subjugation and marginalization of specific groups of people within a country or society, such as women, people of color, religious communities, citizens in poverty, LGBT people, youth and children, and more. This socioeconomic, cultural, political, legal, and social oppression can occur in every country, culture, and society, including advanced democracies.

There is no single, widely accepted definition of social oppression. Philosopher Elanor Taylor defines social oppression in this way:

Oppression is a form of injustice that occurs when one social group is subordinated while another is privileged, and oppression is maintained by a variety of different mechanisms including social norms, stereotypes and institutional rules. A key feature of oppression is that it is perpetrated by and affects social groups. ... [Oppression] occurs when a particular social group is unjustly subordinated, and where that subordination is not necessarily deliberate but instead results from a complex network of social restrictions, ranging from laws and institutions to implicit biases and stereotypes. In such cases, there may be no deliberate attempt to subordinate the relevant group, but the group is nonetheless unjustly subordinated by this network of social constraints. 

Philosopher Jean Harvey, suggests the term &quot;civilized oppression&quot;, which she introduces as follows:

It is harder still to become aware of what I call &#x27;civilized Oppression,&#x27; that involves neither physical violence nor the use of law. Yet these subtle forms are by far the most prevalent in Western industrialized societies. This work will focus on issues that are common to such subtle oppression in several different contexts (such as racism, classism, and sexism) ... Analyzing what is involved in civilized oppression includes analyzing the kinds of mechanisms used, the power relations at work, the systems controlling perceptions and information, the kinds of harms inflicted on the victims, and the reasons why this oppression is so hard to see even by contributing agents.

Research and theory development on social oppression has advanced apace since the 1980s with the publication of seminal books and articles, and the cross-pollination of ideas and discussion among diverse disciplines, such as feminism, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and political science. Nonetheless, more fully understanding the problem remains an extremely complicated challenge for scholars. Improved understanding will require, for example, comprehending more completely the historical antecedents of current social oppression; the commonalities and lack thereofamong the various social groups damaged by social oppression and the individual human beings who make up those groups; and the complex interplay between and amongst sociocultural, political, economic, psychological, and legal forces that cause and support oppression.

==Social oppression==

A common conception of social oppression is seen as when a single group in society unjustly takes advantage of, and exercises power over, another group using dominance and subordination. This then results in the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group of individuals by those with relative power. In a social group setting, oppression may be based on many ideas, such as poverty, gender, class, race, caste, or other categories.

According to Iris Marion Young, due to its pluralistic character, it is difficult to construct a definition that applies to all forms of oppression. Therefore, she argues one should focus on the characteristics different forms of oppression might exhibit or have in common. In order to do so, Young develops five characteristics or &#x27;faces&#x27; of oppression. Each form of oppression possesses at least one of these characteristics which are: exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and violence. Young&#x27;s conception of oppression does not involve an &quot;active oppressor&quot;. This means that oppression can occur without people actively oppressing others. Specifically, Young argues thatoppression is the inhibition of a group through a vast network of everyday practices, attitudes, assumptions, behaviors, and institutional rules. Oppression is structural or systemic. The systemic character of oppression implies that an oppressed group need not have a correlate oppressing group. Structural or systemic refers to &quot;the rules that constitute and regulate the major sectors of life such as family relations, property ownership and exchange, political powers and responsibilities, and so on&quot;. Young&#x27;s conception of oppression is therefore in contrast with other common notions of oppression, where an identifiable oppressing group is assumed. Another example of social oppression given by Young is when a specific social group is denied access to education that may hinder their lives in later life. Economic oppression is the divide between two classes of society. These were once determined by factors such slavery, property rights, disenfranchisement, and forced displacement of livelihood. Each divide yielded various treatments and attitudes towards each group.

According to Marilyn Frye, one of the most common characteristics of social oppression is the &quot;double-bind&quot;, a situation where the oppressed are exposed to limited options, all of which incurring social penalty. An example of said situation exists for young women in the 21st century regarding sexual activity. Both sexual inactivity and sexual activity might incur a penalty. If a woman is sexually inactive, her parents might worry that she is abnormal, and men will complain that she is &quot;frigid&quot; and &quot;uptight&quot;, while in the latter situation she may be condemned for being a whore. This scenario reveals how oppression may not necessarily be caused by individual oppressors, following Young&#x27;s conclusions.

Social oppression derives from power dynamics and imbalances related to the social location of a group or individual. Social location, as defined by Lynn Weber, is &quot;an individual&#x27;s or a group&#x27;s social &#x27;place&#x27; in the race, class, gender and sexuality hierarchies, as well as in other critical social hierarchies such as age, ethnicity, and nation&quot;. An individual&#x27;s social location often determines how they will be perceived and treated by others in society. Three elements shape whether a group or individual can exercise power: the power to design or manipulate the rules and regulations, the capacity to win competitions through the exercise of political or economic force, and the ability to write and document social and political history.

Jim Sidanius suggests that there are four predominant social hierarchies, race, class, gender and sexuality, that contribute to social oppression. Audre Lorde, on the other hand, believes that there cannot be any hierarchy of oppression due to her experiences as both a Black and lesbian woman. In &quot;There is no Hierarchy of Oppressions,&quot; she suggests that all oppressed groups share the same issue. She writes that &quot;any attack against black people is a lesbian and gay issue&quot;, promoting the idea that due to intersectionality within a given group, all of its members and their respective groups are under threat, viewing the concept of oppression as originating from a root source which seeks to alienate all groups not in power.

One aspect of social oppression&#x27;s effectiveness is the stigmatization of &quot;resistance&quot;: Resistance to oppression has been linked to a moral obligation, an act deemed necessary for the preservation of self and society. Resistance is sometimes labeled as &quot;lawlessness, belligerence, envy, or laziness&quot;.

===Privilege===

Lynn Weber, among some other political theorists, argues that oppression persists because most individuals fail to recognize it; that is, discrimination is often not visible to those who are not in the midst of it. &quot;Privilege&quot; refers to a sociopolitical immunity one group has over others derived from particular societal benefits. Many of the groups who have privilege over gender, race, or sexuality, for example, can be unaware of the power their privilege holds. These inequalities further perpetuate themselves because those who are oppressed rarely have access to resources that would allow them to escape their maltreatment. This can lead to internalized oppression, where subordinate groups essentially give up the fight to get access to equality, and accept their fate as a non-dominant group.

Scholar L. Ayu Saraswati highlights the potency of privilege hidden within groups generally considered oppressed. Such can occur within women, as second-wave feminism disproportionately focused on white women and their respective issues rather than women as a whole. This led to Black women and the higher level of economic challenges they were faced with being unaddressed, and often uplifted women only in a racially privileged position. According to Saraswati, by not fighting the presuppositions of racism, these actors in the women&#x27;s movement failed to address their oppression at its root, simultaneously fighting for the issues of white women and accepting the societal structures which held Black women down. Even when Black feminists bring up issues of both gender and class, they often fail to account for heterosexual privilege amidst Black women, still supporting homophobic assumptions about sexuality and leaving many members of the movement behind.

===Racial oppression===

Race or racial oppression is defined as &quot;burdening a specific race with unjust or cruel restraints or impositions. Racial oppression may be social, systematic, institutionalized, or internalized. Social forms of racial oppression include exploitation and mistreatment that is socially supported.&quot; In his 1972 work, &quot;Racial Oppression in America&quot;, sociologist Bob Blauner proposes five primary forms of racial oppression in United States history: genocide and geographical displacement, slavery, second-class citizenship, non-citizen labor, and diffuse racial discrimination. Blauner states that even after civil rights legislation abolished legally-sanctioned segregation, racial oppression remained a reality in the United States and &quot;racial groups and racial oppression are central features of the American social dynamic&quot;.

===Class discrimination===

Class oppression, sometimes referred to as classism, can be defined as prejudice and discrimination based on social class. Class is a social ranking system which is based on income, wealth, education, status, and power. A class is a large group of people who share similar economic or social positions based on their income, wealth, property ownership, job status, education, skills, or power in the economic and political sphere. The most commonly used class categories include upper class, middle class, working class, and poor class. Class is also experienced differently depending on race, gender, ethnicity, global location, disability, and more. Class oppression of the poor and working class can lead to deprivation of basic needs and a feeling of inferiority to higher-class people, as well as shame towards one&#x27;s traditional class, race, gender, or ethnic heritage. In the United States, class has become racialized leaving the greater percentage of people of color living in poverty.

===Gender oppression===

Gender oppression is a form of social oppression, which occurs due to belonging or seeming to belong to a specific gender. Historically, gender oppression occurred through actual legal domination and subordination of men over women. Even key aspects of social life traditionally seen as &quot;neutral&quot;, such as language, can sustain gender oppression according to Gertrude Postl. This is due to sexist language and the lack of terms that relate to experiences specific to women. For example, the term &quot;sexual harassment&quot; was only coined in 1975.

Young argues that women in particular suffer from gender-based exploitation, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and violence. To illustrate, gender exploitation relates to how the common labor division between men and women can be exploitative. She argues that &quot;gender exploitation has two aspects, transfer of the fruits of material labor to men and transfer of nurturing and sexual energies to men&quot;. Specifically, in a heterosexual relationship, women often take care of unpaid households chores and child care labor, which benefits both the man as the woman. In this sense, women are performing labor from which the man benefits and thus at least part of the value of this labor is transferred to the man. This exploitation need not be done consciously or even intentionally. As Young argues, oppression can occur without an active &quot;oppressor&quot;. This definition of oppression attempts to address the concern that feminist theories unjustly blame men for the oppression of women. Men can sympathize with feminism, but still be complicit in the oppression of women.

In her article on oppression, Marilyn Frye suggests a myopic approach is necessary to understand how in society at large, women are sequestered to a second class role. Though individual barriers, such as small actions resulting of social roles and expectations, may not provide too much of a barrier for any one woman, the interweaving of many of said actions through each day and each year eventually builds a net which very well might hold a woman in place, and keep her in the role she is ordered to maintain. One simple example is the custom of men holding the door for a woman, which may be well-intentioned, but implies that women are uncapable of doing simple tasks themselves.

===Religious persecution===
Religious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of individuals because of their religious beliefs. According to Iris Young oppression can be divided into different categories such as powerlessness, exploitation, and violence.

An example of religious powerlessness existed during the 17th century when the Pilgrims, who wanted to escape the rule of the Church of England came to what is now called the United States. The Pilgrims created their own religion, which was another form of Protestantism, and after doing so they eventually passed laws in order to prevent other religions from prospering in their colony. The Pilgrims and the leaders of other communities where Protestants were in the majority used their power over legislatures to oppress followers of other religions in the United States.

The second category of oppression, exploitation, has been seen in many different forms around the world when it comes to religion. The definition of exploitation is the action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work. For example, during, and particularly after, the American Civil War, white Americans used Chinese immigrants to build the transcontinental railroads. During this time it was common for the Chinese immigrants to follow the religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, because of this the Chinese were considered different and therefore not equal to white Americans. Due to this view Chinese workers were denied equal pay, and they also suffered many hardships during the time which they spent working on the railroad.

The third and most extreme category of oppression is violence. According to the Merriam-Webster&#x27;s dictionary, violence is &quot;the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy&quot;. Acts of religious violence which are committed against people who practice a particular religion are classified as hate crimes. Since September 11th, 2001, the number of hate crimes which have been committed against Muslims in the United States has greatly increased. One such incident occurred on August 5, 2017, when three men bombed a mosque in Minnesota because they felt that Muslims &quot;&#x27;push their beliefs on everyone else&#x27;&quot;. Acts of religious violence are also committed against practitioners of other religions in addition to Islam.
===Institutionalized oppression===
Institutional oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systemically reflect and produce inequities based on one&#x27;s membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions.&quot;
Institutionalized oppression allows for government, religious, and business organizations and their employees to systematically favor specific groups of people based upon group identity. Dating back to colonization, the United States implemented the annihilation of Native Americans from lands that Euro-Americans wanted, and condoned the institution of slavery where Africans were brought to the New World to be a source of free labor to expand the cotton and tobacco industry.

Although the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments freed African Americans, gave them citizenship, and provided them the right to vote, institutions such as some police departments continue to use oppressive systems against minorities. They train their officers to profile individuals based upon their racial heritage, and to exert excessive force to restrain them. Racial profiling and police brutality are &quot;employed to control a population thought to be undesirable, undeserving, and under punished by established law&quot;. In both situations, police officers &quot;rely on legal authority to exonerate their extralegal use of force; both respond to perceived threats and fears aroused by out-groups, especially— but not exclusively— racial minorities&quot;. For example, &quot;blacks are: approximately four times more likely to be targeted for police use of force than their white counterparts; arrested and convicted for drug-related criminal activities at higher rates than their overall representation in the U.S. population; and are more likely to fear unlawful and harsh treatment by law enforcement officials&quot;. The International Association of Chiefs of Police collected data from police departments between the years 1995 and 2000 and found that 83% of incidents involving use-of-force against subjects of different races than the officer executing it involved a white officer and a Black subject.

Institutionalized oppression is not only experienced by people of racial minorities, but can also affect those in the LGBT community. In April 1953, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued Executive Order 10450, which permitted non-binary sexual behaviors to be investigated by federal agencies. In addition, states such as Arizona and Kansas passed laws in 2014 giving religious-based businesses &quot;the right to refuse service to LGBT customers&quot;. In 2018 and 2023, the US Supreme Court ruled against Colorado&#x27;s anti-discrimination laws in &quot;Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission&quot; and &quot;303 Creative LLC v. Elenis&quot; respectively.

School segregation in the United States is observed by some educators as oppression or closure because students are denied access to resources and the privileged class is signaled that its denial of goods is justified.

===Economic oppression===
Economic oppression can take many forms, including, but not limited to, serfdom, forced labour, low wages, denial of equal opportunity, bonded labor, employment discrimination, and economic discrimination based on sex, nationality, race, or religion.

Ann Cudd describes the main forces of economic oppression as oppressive economic systems and direct and indirect forces. Even though capitalism and socialism are not inherently oppressive, they &quot;lend themselves to oppression in characteristic ways&quot;. She defines direct forces of economic oppression as &quot;restrictions on opportunities that are applied from the outside on the oppressed, including enslavement, segregation, employment discrimination, group-based harassment, opportunity inequality, neocolonialism, and governmental corruption&quot;. This allows for a dominant social group to maintain and maximize its wealth through the intentional exploitation of economically inferior subordinates. With indirect forces (also known as oppression by choice), &quot;the oppressed are co-opted into making individual choices that add to their own oppression&quot;. The oppressed are faced with having to decide to go against their social good, and even against their own good. If they choose otherwise, they have to choose against their interests, which may lead to resentment by their group.

An example of direct forces of economic oppression is employment discrimination in the form of the gender pay gap. Restrictions on women&#x27;s access to and participation in the workforce like the wage gap is an &quot;inequality most identified with industrialized nations with nominal equal opportunity laws; legal and cultural restrictions on access to education and jobs, inequities most identified with developing nations; and unequal access to capital, variable but identified as a difficulty in both industrialized and developing nations&quot;. In the United States, the median weekly earnings for women were 82 percent of the median weekly earnings for men in 2016. Some argue women are prevented from achieving complete gender equality in the workplace because of the &quot;ideal-worker norm,&quot; which &quot;defines the committed worker as someone who works full-time and full force for forty years straight,&quot; a situation designed for the male sex.

Women, in contrast, are still expected to fulfill the caretaker role and take time off for domestic needs such as pregnancy and ill family members, preventing them from conforming to the &quot;ideal-worker norm&quot;. With the current norm in place, women are forced to juggle full-time jobs and family care at home. Others believe that this difference in wage earnings is likely due to the supply and demand for women in the market because of family obligations. Eber and Weichselbaumer argue that &quot;over time, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially. Most of this decrease is due to better labor market endowments of females&quot;.

Indirect economic oppression is exemplified when individuals work abroad to support their families. Outsourced employees, working abroad generally little to no bargaining power not only with their employers, but with immigration authorities as well. They could be forced to accept low wages and work in poor living conditions. And by working abroad, an outsourced employee contributes to the economy of a foreign country instead of their own. Veltman and Piper describe the effects of outsourcing on female laborers abroad:
Her work may be oppressive first in respects of being heteronomous: she may enter work under conditions of constraint; her work may bear no part of reflectively held life goals; and she may not even have the: freedom of bodily movement at work. Her work may also fail to permit a meaningful measure of economic independence or to help her support herself or her family, which she identifies as the very purpose of her working.

By deciding to work abroad, laborers are &quot;reinforcing the forces of economic oppression that presented them with such poor options&quot;.

== Oppression and intersectionality ==

A different approach on oppression, called the intersectional approach was introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw to refer to the various ways in which race and gender interact to shape the multiple dimensions of Black women&#x27;s employment experiences. Elena Ruiz defines intersectionality as a form of oppression containing multiple social vectors and overlapping identity categories such as sex, race, and class that are not ready visible in single identities, but have to be taken into account as an integral, robust human experience.

An intersectional approach to oppression requires attending to the differential ways different grounds for oppression such as gender, race, sexuality, class, religion, and so forth work together to create a unique situation for certain oppressed people. Crenshaw argues that viewing feminism as categorizing all women as one cohesive category of oppressed people obscures differences of experiences of oppression within such groups. A Black woman is not just the sum of the two categories.

This intersectional approach has been influential in academic fields studying different forms of social oppression. However, although Crenshaw argues her intersectional approach captures important differences within certain oppressed groups, Patricia Hill Collins objects that her approach is unable to capture the macro-level systemic nature of intersectional oppression. In other words, Crenshaw&#x27;s concept of intersectionality captures the individual experiences of oppressed persons that do not solely fall under one header of sexism, racism, or something else. However, it is not suited to capture the way, for example, sexism and racism work together at a (macro) societal level. Both conjoin to influence the unique experience of oppression as felt by, for example, Black women.

Authors such as Jennifer Nash explore what the limits of intersectionality. For instance, does this approach only concern marginalized groups, or is everyone intersectional in some way. Guiding questions in this regard concern in what way an intersectional approach might bring to the surface certain previously obscured experiences of oppression.
Jennifer Nash also argues that so far, intersectional approaches have focused either on intersections between forms or grounds for oppression or privilege, whereas the two can also work together. The value of an intersectional approach on oppression is to see how different forms of oppression intersect with each other and with the privileges held by others. Racial, economic, class-based, religious, gender-based, authoritarian, and social oppression in general often intersect in many different ways and co-exist with opposited forms of privilege to create novel and unique forms of oppression.

===Feminism and equal rights===

In her article &quot;Feminist Politics,&quot; bell hooks discusses the intersectional challenges of the early feminist movements in the 20th century. She divides female activists into groups labeled the &quot;reformist&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot; feminists. Reformist feminists were often at the forefront of the media, primarily as a result of their unspoken support of other forms of oppression, and more easily met requests. The reformists represented the white female population, and as a result of existing within a world of white supremacy, which their platform inherently supported, they were often considered the primary feminist movement. Revolutionary feminists, on the other hand, included Black and LGBTQ issues in their platform, wanting not to work within the current system simply to improve the rights of already privileged women, but to rework the system to be more supportive of all women from other marginalized groups. The American feminist movement was polarized by these two groups. Many women, and often privileged white women, forgot about the promise of revolutionary feminism when they began to gain economic power as a result of the reformist movements partial success. This further set back those who wished to fight sexism and other kinds of oppression at the same time. Revolutionary feminist thinking was further pushed aside as even academic circles would not discuss it easily. Furthermore, reformist feminists, upon finding a route to class mobility, refused to acknowledge the now niche revolutionary feminist movement, as they had found a way to live in an economically powerful way in the current social system.

=== Domination theory ===
Addressing social oppression on both a macro and micro level, feminist Patricia Hill Collins discusses what she calls the &quot;matrix of domination&quot;. The matrix maps the interrelated nature of four domains of power: the structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal domains. Each of these domains works to sustain current inequalities faced by marginalized, excluded, or oppressed groups. The structural, disciplinary, and hegemonic domains all operate on a macro level, creating social oppression through macro structures such as education, or the criminal justice system, which play out in the interpersonal sphere of everyday life through micro-oppressions.

<text>August Robert Ludwig Macke (3 January 1887 – 26 September 1914) was a German Expressionist painter. He was one of the leading members of the German Expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider). He lived during a particularly active time for German art: he saw the development of the main German Expressionist movements as well as the arrival of the successive avant-garde movements which were forming in the rest of Europe. As an artist of his time, Macke knew how to integrate into his painting the elements of the avant-garde which most interested him. Like his friend Franz Marc and Otto Soltau, he was one of the young German artists who died in the First World War.

==Early life==

August Robert Ludwig Macke was born in Germany on 3 January 1887, in Meschede, Westphalia. He was the only son of August Friedrich Hermann Macke (1845–1904), a building contractor and amateur artist, and his wife, Maria Florentine, née Adolph, (1848–1922), who came from a farming family in Westphalia&#x27;s Sauerland region. Shortly after August&#x27;s birth the family settled at Cologne, where Macke was educated at the Kreuzgymnasium (1897–1900) and became a friend of Hans Thuar, who also became an artist. In 1900, when he was thirteen, the family moved to Bonn, where Macke studied at the Realgymnasium and became a friend of Walter Gerhardt and Gerhardt&#x27;s sister, Elisabeth, whom he married a few years later.

The first artistic works to make an impression on the boy were his father&#x27;s drawings, the Japanese prints collected by his friend Thuar&#x27;s father and the works of Arnold Böcklin which he saw on a visit to Basel in 1900. In 1904 Macke&#x27;s father died, and in that year Macke enrolled at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, under Adolf Maennchen (1904–1906). During this period he also took evening classes under Fritz Helmut Ehmke (1905), did some work as a stage and costume designer at the Schauspielhaus Düsseldorf, and visited northern Italy (1905) and Netherlands, Belgium and Britain (1906).

==Artistic career 1907–1914==
Thereafter Macke lived most of his creative life in Bonn, with the exception of a few periods spent at Lake Thun in Switzerland and various trips to Paris, Italy, the Netherlands and Tunisia. In Paris, where he traveled for the first time in 1907, Macke saw the work of the Impressionists, and shortly after he went to Berlin and spent a few months in Lovis Corinth&#x27;s studio. His style was formed within the mode of French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism and later went through a Fauve period. In 1909 he married Elisabeth Gerhardt. In 1910, through his friendship with Franz Marc, Macke met Kandinsky and for a while shared the non-objective aesthetic and the mystical and symbolic interests of Der Blaue Reiter.

Macke&#x27;s meeting with Robert Delaunay in Paris in 1912 was to be a sort of revelation for him. Delaunay&#x27;s chromatic Cubism, which Apollinaire had called Orphism, influenced Macke&#x27;s art from that point onwards. His &quot;Shops Windows&quot; can be considered a personal interpretation of Delaunay&#x27;s &quot;Windows,&quot; combined with the simultaneity of images found in Italian Futurism.
The exotic atmosphere of Tunisia, where Macke traveled in April 1914 with Paul Klee and Louis Moilliet was fundamental for the creation of the luminist approach of his final period, during which he produced a series of works now considered masterpieces, like his famous painting &quot;Türkisches Café&quot;. August Macke&#x27;s oeuvre can be considered as Expressionism (in its original German flourishing between 1905 and 1925), and also as part of Fauvism. The paintings concentrate primarily on expressing feelings and moods rather than reproducing objective reality, usually distorting colour and form.

Macke&#x27;s career was cut short by his early death in the second month of the First World War at the front in Champagne, France, on 26 September 1914. He was buried in the German Military Cemetery in Souain-Perthes-lès-Hurlus. His final painting, &quot;Farewell&quot;, depicts the mood of gloom that settled after the outbreak of war.

==Selected paintings==

==August Macke Prize==

The August Macke Prize, was given the first time in 1959 by the districts Arnsberg, Brilon, Olpe and Meschede, town of birth of August Macke in Germany.

==August-Macke-Haus==

The August-Macke-Haus is a museum dedicated to August Macke founded in 1991. It is located in Macke&#x27;s former home in Bonn, where he lived from 1911 to 1914.

==Art market==
At a 1997 Christie&#x27;s auction, Macke&#x27;s &quot;The Couple at a Garden Table&quot; (1914) was sold for £2 million. &quot;Market in Tunis&quot; (1914) sold for £2.86 million ($4.1 million) in 2000. Consigned by the estate of Ernst Beyeler, the artist&#x27;s &quot;In the Bazar&quot; (1914) was auctioned for £3.96 million – then four and a half times the high estimate – at Christie&#x27;s in 2011.

In 2007, the Berlin auction house Villa Grisebach sold Macke’s &quot;Woman with a Parrot in a Landscape&quot; for €2.4 million, setting a record price for the artist. The painting&#x27;s provenance mentioned it was confiscated in 1937 as &#x27;degenerate&#x27;. In the 2008 catalogue of Macke’s works, Hildebrand Gurlitt, Hitler&#x27;s art dealer was mentioned in the provenance.

<text>Brienz ( , , ) is a village and municipality on the northern shore of Lake Brienz, at the foot of the Brienzer Rothorn mountain, and in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. Besides the village of Brienz, the municipality includes the settlements of Kienholz and Axalp.

Politically, the municipality is located in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district of the canton of Bern.

==History==
The first settlements date from the neolithic and Bronze Ages. In the 5th century BC, the Celts settled in the alpine valleys among the sources of the Rhone, the Rhine and the Danube, eventually stretching from the headwaters down to Vienna and Belgrade. At the end of 1st century BC the Romans conquered this area. The Roman settlements were destroyed by the Alamanni in 259/60. They eventually settled in the area around 450. In any case, evidence has been found for a settlement by the Alamanni in the 7th century. Brienz is first mentioned in 1146 as &quot;Briens&quot;. In 1528, after an eventful history, Brienz became part of the Canton of Bern.

Lake Brienz has probably been in use as a transport route since pre-history, but the first steamship was introduced in 1839, operating a route between Interlaken and Brienz. In 1888, the metre gauge Brünig railway opened between Brienz and Alpnachstad, on Lake Lucerne. Brienz therefore became, for a while, a transfer point on a hybrid ship and rail route from Interlaken to Lucerne. By 1916 the Brünig railway had been extended to Interlaken along the north shore of the lake, and Brienz found itself simply an intermediate stop on a through rail route.

==Geography==

The municipality of Brienz includes a number of communities along the upper end of Lake Brienz, and stretches into the neighboring mountains. It includes the village of Brienz on the right shore, the mouth of the Aare and the village of Kienholz to the north and the settlements of Engi and Schwendi on the left bank. Heading away from the right shore the land rises to the Rotschalp, Planalp and Giebelegg before reaching the Brienzer Rothorn (). Heading away from the left shore it rises over the Brienzerberg and Giessbach Falls, Tschingelfeld, Hinterburg and Axalp until it reaches the Schwarzhorn ().

The parish of Brienz includes Oberried am Brienzersee, Schwanden bei Brienz, Hofstetten bei Brienz and Brienzwiler.

Brienz has an area of . Of this area, or 38.6% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 33.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 4.5% is settled (buildings or roads), or 1.1% is either rivers or lakes and or 22.2% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 2.2% and transportation infrastructure made up 1.6%. Out of the forested land, 29.9% of the total land area is heavily forested and 2.7% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 7.2% is pastures and 30.5% is used for alpine pastures. Of the water in the municipality, 0.3% is in lakes and 0.8% is in rivers and streams. Of the unproductive areas, 8.6% is unproductive vegetation and 13.3% is too rocky for vegetation.

On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Interlaken, the municipality&#x27;s former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Interlaken-Oberhasli.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Per bend sinister wavy Azure and Argent overall a Lion rampant counterchanged langued and vilene Gules.&quot;

==History==
&quot;Saipan&quot; was laid down on 21 July 1972 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division, Litton Industries of Pascagoula, Mississippi; launched on 20 July 1974 and sponsored by the wife of Secretary of the Navy J. William Middendorf.

&quot;Saipan&quot;&#x27;s operational career began in July 1979 when she was diverted from Fleet Refresher Training to Special Contingency Operations, for possible non-combatant evacuation of American personnel from the Nicaraguan Revolution.

===1980s===
From February to April 1980, &quot;Saipan&quot; was involved in &quot;Anorak Express 80&quot;. The Navy crew of around 800 and an entire Marine battalion of over 2,000 sailed from Norfolk to Norway. In May, &quot;Saipan&quot; was underway to augment U.S. Coast Guard efforts to assist Cuban refugees crossing the Straits of Florida to the United States during the Mariel boatlift. On 25 August, &quot;Saipan&quot; departed Norfolk for the first Mediterranean deployment by an LHA.

On 3 September 1981, &quot;Saipan&quot; deployed for her second tour in the Mediterranean Sea. During that deployment, &quot;Saipan&quot; visited or operated in seven countries on three continents.

From August 1982 through July 1983, &quot;Saipan&quot; was in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her first scheduled complex overhaul. In September 1983, while undergoing Refresher Training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;Saipan&quot; was diverted to participate in Operation Urgent Fury off Grenada.

Following a four-month restricted availability in Norfolk Naval Shipyard, &quot;Saipan&quot; sailed to Guantanamo Bay to complete various training evolutions.

On 17 August 1986, &quot;Saipan&quot; departed on its fourth Mediterranean deployment. Extended briefly in the Eastern Mediterranean for contingency operations, &quot;Saipan&quot; returned to Norfolk on 24 February 1987.

Starting at the end of October 1987, &quot;Saipan&quot; was in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for major refitting. In January 1989, &quot;Saipan&quot; returned to Norfolk, Virginia.

===1990s===
From March 1990 through September 1990, &quot;Saipan&quot; was deployed for the fifth time to the Mediterranean. However, in late May 1990 it was diverted into the Eastern Atlantic, to what would become known as &quot;Mamba Station&quot;. While there, &quot;Saipan&quot; conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO), evacuating 1,600 civilians from war-torn Liberia in support of Operation Sharp Edge.

From September 1991 to March 1992, &quot;Saipan&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Storm.

&quot;Saipan&quot; again deployed to the Mediterranean in March 1993, in support of Operation Deny Flight and Operation Provide Promise. The ship returned in September 1993 and began her third scheduled complex overhaul in April 1994.

In June 1996, &quot;Saipan&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean and participated in &quot;Operation Decisive Endeavor&quot; and various multi-national training exercises. She returned to Norfolk in December 1996.

&quot;Saipan&quot; departed on her seventh deployment to the Mediterranean in July 1998. &quot;Saipan&quot; spent substantial operating time in the Adriatic Sea due to turmoil in Albania. On 28 July 1998 &quot;Saipan&quot; went to the rescue of the motor yacht MY &quot;Huntress&quot; which was burning approximately southwest of Corfu and east of Nisos Island (&quot;sic&quot;). The crew and guests were saved, but &quot;Huntress &quot; burned and sank despite damage control efforts of &quot;Saipan&quot;.

During her 1998 deployment to the Mediterranean &quot;Saipan&quot; with an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (22nd MEU) (SOC) were split up to support several missions including &quot;Operation Balkan Calm&quot; in support of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM) from 15 July 1998 to 19 November 1998, &quot;Operation Autumn Shelter&quot;, the Non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO) of the U.S. embassy in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo from 10 August 1998 to 16 August 1998 and &quot;Operation Resolve Resolute&quot; in support of the &quot;Albania Security Mission&quot; at the U.S. embassy in Tirane, Albania from 17 August 1998 to 15 November 1998.

In 1999, &quot;Saipan&quot; became the developmental and operational test platform for the V-22 Osprey aircraft.

===2000s===

In July 2000, &quot;Saipan&quot; began her eighth Mediterranean deployment. The ship commenced Adriatic presence operations during the Fall of 2000 federal elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

On 12 February 2001, &quot;Saipan&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for its fourth scheduled complex overhaul.

On 10 January 2003, &quot;Saipan&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the War on Terrorism.

From late January 2005 until early March 2005, &quot;Saipan&quot; was on a scheduled deployment to the U.S. Southern Command (USNAVSO) area of responsibility in support of New Horizons, the humanitarian civic assistance efforts in Haiti. In early June, she made an official visit to Oslo on the occasion of Norway&#x27;s independence centennial. During the week of 26 June 2005, &quot;Saipan&quot; was one of two American military vessels (the other being ) to participate in the Royal Navy International Fleet Review in the waters off Portsmouth, England. This review, conducted by Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the Royal Family, consisted of a parade of more than 166 ships from around the world. This event also coincided with the 2005 International Festival of the Sea and Trafalgar 200 celebration.

In May 2006, &quot;Saipan&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean to take part in multi-national training exercises during &quot;Operation Phoenix Express&quot; which involved the countries of Spain, Morocco, and Algeria. She returned to Norfolk in July. From 16 August, &quot;Saipan&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf region in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for her final operational deployment. She returned to Norfolk on 22 December.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Saipan&quot; was decommissioned on 20 April 2007 at her home port in Naval Station Norfolk. She was used for weapons effect testing, providing vital information on structural integrity and survivability which will assist in the designing and planning of future ships. She was transferred to the inactive fleet, and was tied up at Pier 4 of the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, where she was joined by ex- on 22 March 2008.

On 30 September 2009, a contract to dismantle ex-&quot;Saipan&quot; was issued to International Shipbreaking Ltd, Brownsville, Texas and on 28 October 2009 the ship departed Philadelphia under tow.

International Shipbreaking completed scrapping ex-&quot;Saipan&quot; on 23 February 2011.

==USS &quot;Saipan&quot; awards ==
&quot;Saipan&quot;s awards include the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Navy Expeditionary Medal (two awards), Humanitarian Service Medal, Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; (four awards), the Admiral Flatley Safety Award (two awards), the Sledge Award, the Atlantic Fleet Surface Force &quot;Admiral’s Cup&quot; in 1985, COMPHIBRON Twelve&#x27;s &quot;Bronze Anchor&quot; for retention excellence, and the 1993 COMNAVSURFLANT Command Excellence Award for Command and Control, Maritime Warfare and Logistics Management.

<text>Charles Homer Haskins (December 21, 1870 – May 14, 1937) was an American medievalist at Harvard University. He was an advisor to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. He is widely recognized as the first academic medieval historian in the United States, and the Haskins Medal was named in his honor.

==Biography==
Haskins was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania.

He was a prodigy, fluent in both Latin and Greek while still a young boy, taught by his father. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University at the age of 16, and then studied in Paris and Berlin. He received a Ph.D. in history from Johns Hopkins University and began teaching there before the age of 20. In 1890, he was appointed instructor at the University of Wisconsin, became a full professor in two years, and from 1892 to 1902 held the European history chair there. In 1902 he moved to Harvard University, where he taught until 1931.

Haskins became politically involved enough to become a close advisor of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, whom he had met at Johns Hopkins. When Wilson attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 where the Treaty of Versailles was drawn up, he brought only three advisors including Haskins, who served as chief of the Western European division of the American commission.

Haskins was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1913 and the American Philosophical Society in 1921.

He died on May 14, 1937, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His widow died in 1970.

==Legacy==
He was primarily a historian of institutions, like medieval universities and governments. His works reflect the mostly twentieth-century optimistic, liberal view that progressive government by &quot;the best and brightest&quot; is the way to go. His histories of medieval Europe&#x27;s institutions stress the efficiency and successes of their governing bureaucracies, implicitly analogous to those of modern nation states.

Haskins&#x27;s most well known pupil was medieval historian Joseph Strayer, who went on to teach many American medievalists of the next generation(s) at Princeton University, some still active today. Other eminent medievalists trained by Haskins included Lynn White, Jr. (UCLA), Gaines Post (Wisconsin and Princeton), Carl Stephenson (Cornell), Edgar B. Graves (Hamilton College), and John R. Williams (Dartmouth).

The Haskins Society, named in his honor was organized in 1982, a &quot;Founding Father&quot; being the late C. Warren Hollister. It publishes an annual &quot;Journal&quot; whose volume 11 (2003) reconsidered Haskins&#x27; magnum opus seventy years after its publication. From 1920 to 1926, he was also the first chairman of the American Council of Learned Societies, which still offers a distinguished lecture series named after him.

His son George Haskins was a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor.

==&quot;The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century&quot;==
Haskins&#x27; most famous work is &quot;The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century&quot; (1927). The word &quot;Renaissance,&quot; even to historians in the early 20th century, meant the 15th-century Italian Renaissance, as defined by 19th-century Swiss historian Jakob Burckhardt in his &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot;. Haskins opened a broader view when he asserted, &quot;The continuity of history rejects violent contrasts between successive periods, and modern research shows the Middle Ages less dark and less static, the Renaissance less bright and less sudden, than was once supposed. The Italian Renaissance was preceded by similar, if less wide-reaching, movements.&quot;

Haskins&#x27; fresh assessment of a sort of pre-renaissance, ushering in the High Middle Ages around 1070, was resisted by some scholars at first. His approach was broader than a mere literary revival: he stated in his preface that he found that 12th-century Europe
Haskins focused on high culture to prove that the 12th century was indeed a period of dynamic growth. He looked at the history of art and science, the universities, philosophy, architecture and literature, and provided a celebratory view of the period. More recent views of the renewal have expanded the focus. Once the ice had been broken, other scholars concentrated on an earlier, more constrained revival of learning in some circles under the patronage of Charlemagne, and began talking and thinking of a &quot;Carolingian Renaissance&quot; of the ninth century. By 1960, Erwin Panofsky could write of &quot;Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art&quot;.

Less wide-ranging was Haskins&#x27; earlier study of the Normans, &quot;Norman Institutions&quot; (1918), which still forms the basis of current scholarly understanding of how medieval Normandy functioned. He also wrote the more popular book &quot;The Normans in European History&quot; (1915).

<text>Juxtapoz Art &amp; Culture Magazine (pronounced &quot;JUX-tah-pose&quot;) is a magazine created in 1994 by a group of artists and art collectors including Robert Williams, Fausto Vitello, C.R. Stecyk III (a.k.a. Craig Stecyk), Greg Escalante, and Eric Swenson to both help define and celebrate urban alternative and underground contemporary art. &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; is published by High Speed Productions, the same company that publishes &quot;Thrasher&quot; skateboard magazine in San Francisco, California.

==Scope==
&quot;Juxtapoz&quot; launched with the mission of connecting modern genres like psychedelic and hot rod art, graffiti, street art, and illustration, to the context of broader more historically recognized genres of art like Pop, assemblage, old master painting, and conceptual art. Although based in San Francisco, &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; was founded upon the belief in the virtues of Southern California pop culture and freedom from the conventions of the &quot;established&quot; New York City art world. Ferus Gallery, run by Walter Hopps and Irving Blum in the 1950s and 1960s, was the ultimate cultural touchstone for the magazine.

&quot;Juxtapoz&quot; originally reflected Williams&#x27; own Kustom Kulture sensibility – a combination of California &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Ed Roth–style pop surrealism (identified by some as synonymous with lowbrow art and others as its own genre) and the serious figurative craftsmanship that is more likely to be found among illustrators than fine artists today.

==Growth==
&quot;Juxtapoz&quot; expanded its range in the early 2000s to cover other nascent styles and subgenres of underground art. Artists who have received coverage in &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; include KAWS, Mark Ryden, Barry McGee, Todd Schorr, Tara McPherson, Camille Rose Garcia, Tim Biskup, Anthony Ausgang, Michael Pearce and Tom Sachs.

As of 2009, &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; had the largest circulation of any art magazine in the United States, more than established counterparts like &quot;Art News&quot;, &quot;Art in America&quot;, and &quot;Artforum&quot;. In addition to printed subscriptions which offer alternative cover images to the newsstand version, &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; is also available as an online digital subscription.

Evan Pricco is the editor-in-chief.

<text>Mahabaleshwar () is a small town and a municipal council in Satara district, Maharashtra, India. It is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus because the Krishna River has its origin here. The British colonial rulers developed the town as a hill station, and it served as the summer capital of the Bombay Presidency during the British Raj.

==Geography==
Mahabaleshwar is located on the mountainous Sahyadri range of the Western Ghats that run North to south along the western coast of India.
The coordinates of the town are . Mahabaleshwar is a vast plateau measuring , bound by valleys on all sides. It reaches a height of at its highest peak above sea level, known as Wilson/Sunrise Point.
The town is about southwest of Pune and from Mumbai.

Mahabaleshwar comprises three villages: Malcolm Peth, Old &quot;Kshetra&quot; Mahabaleshwar, and part of the Shindola village. The Mahabaleshwar region is the source of the Krishna River that flows east across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh towards the Bay of Bengal. Three tributaries of Krishna, namely Koyna, Venna (Veni) and Gayatri, also have their source in Mahabaleshwar region. A fourth river, the Savitri, also has its source in the region, but flows Westward via Mahad to the Arabian Sea.

The area&#x27;s climate is suitable for cultivation of strawberries; Mahabaleshwar strawberry contributes to about 85 percent of the total strawberry production in the country. It also received the geographical indication (GI) tag in 2010.
===Climate===
Mahabaleshwar has a borderline tropical monsoon/humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;/&quot;Cwa&quot;). Very heavy rainfall is a normal occurrence during monsoons. During July, 10–12 days of continuous rains with each day occur each year. There were reports of ice and ground frost formation around Venna Lake in 2018. On August 7, 2019, Mahabaleshwar recorded of rain in 24 hours causing landslides. Mahabaleshwar has been described as the &quot;New Candidate for the wettest place in the world&quot;, the title currently held by Cherrapunji. 

==History==

Legend says that a Yadava ruler from 13th century built a small temple and water tank at the source of the river Krishna. The Valley of Jawali, the area around Mahabaleshwar, was ruled by the More (clan) who were vassals of the Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur.
In 1656, the founder of Maratha empire, Chhatrapati Shivaji, killed the then ruler of Valley of Javali, Chandrarao More, and seized the area. Around that time Shivaji also built a hill fort near Mahabaleshwar called Pratapgad fort.

===British colonial era===
In 1819, after the demise of the Maratha empire, the British ceded the hills around Mahabaleshwar to the vassal state of Satara. Colonel Lodwick (Later General Sir Lodwick) after climbing the mountains near Mahabaleshwar, recommended the place as a sanatorium for the British forces to governor Sir John Malcolm of Bombay presidency. The Raja of Satara was granted other villages in exchange for the British getting Mahabaleshwar in 1828. In old records Mahabaleshwar was even called Malcolm Peth after the governor. 

Mahabaleshwar started gaining prominence when British officials of the Bombay presidency such as Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone, Arthur Malet (for whom the seat at &quot;Point Arthur&quot; is named), Carnac, and many others became regular visitors.
Venna Lake was constructed in 1842 to collect water from perennial springs; the Venna River flows from this lake. Bartley Frere, the commissioner of Satara in the 1850s, built the road from Satara to Mahabaleshwar. In the mid 1800s, Mahabaleshwar was made into the summer capital of the Bombay presidency. Government spending led to rapid development of the area. 

Colonial officials spent part of their year in the area. Their wives spent a longer period of the year in the area to be with their children in local boarding schools in Mahabaleshwar and nearby Panchgani. The British rulers wanted to recreate the English landscape in the hill stations and to that end, European flora such as strawberries were introduced in Mahabaleshwar, and amenities such as libraries, theatres, boating lakes, and sports grounds were constructed.

Added to the scores of magnificent scenic &quot;points&quot;, the perennial springs, streams, and waterfalls of Mahabaleshwar plateau, with its year round superb climate, drew the English and others to Mahabaleshwar. By the end of the 19th century it had become an attractive popular hill station of world renown. Raj Bhavan, the summer residence of the Governor of Maharashtra, is also located here. An older building named &quot;The Terraces&quot; was purchased in 1884 and rechristened as &quot;Giri Darshan&quot; in 1886.

&quot;Babington House&quot;, is a colonial-style bungalow built in the shape of a cross with a deep veranda, elaborate metal work railing and extensive outhouses. It was formerly one of the country seats of the Dubash family, a Parsi ship chandler dynasty from Bombay, before they sold it to the Rahejas in the early 1970s. It contains a central dining room with a 24-seater table and a library pavilion with 1st edition books collected by the Dubash family, notably Jamsetjee &quot;Jimmy&quot; Kavasjee Dubash, a bibliophile and art collector.

<doc id="648504" wikidata="Q5547251" url="?curid=648504" title="Brienz Rothorn Railway">
<text>The Brienz Rothorn Railway (, BRB) is a tourist rack railway in Switzerland, which climbs from Brienz, at the eastern end of Lake Brienz, to the summit of the Brienzer Rothorn. The railway is 7.6 kilometres (4.7 mi) long, is built to 800 mm gauge ( gauge), and uses the Abt double lamella rack system. Unusually for Switzerland, the line is not electrified, and most trains are operated by steam locomotives.

The Brienz Rothorn Railway reaches a height of 2,244 metres above sea level and is the fourth-highest railway in Switzerland.

== History ==

The railway was opened on 17 June 1892, after a two years construction period. The two designers, engineer Alexander Lindner and contractor Theo Bertschinger were supported by the mountain railway pioneer Roman Abt, who had responsibility for equipping the line with his newly developed Abt double lamella rack system.

The line connected at Brienz with the Brünig railway line, which had been opened in 1888 from Brienz eastwards towards Lucerne. However, the Brünig railway was not extended westward to Interlaken until 1916, so many early travelers to the Rothorn had to arrive by boat service on Lake Brienz.

The line was quickly in financial difficulties. The line was designed to carry 25,000 passengers per year, but only managed 5,000 passengers in the first year. Tourist traffic was further affected by the opening of Schynige Platte Railway in 1895 and the Jungfraubahn in 1898. Train service was suspended on 1 August 1914 as a result of the First World War, but did not resume when the war ended.

Essential maintenance was carried out and a small amount of timber traffic was carried from Planalp in 1918. Carriages were hired to the Schynige Platte Railway in 1924 and 1925, providing funds for the maintenance work. The line was finally re-opened on 13 June 1931, the first train to reach the summit in 17 years having run four days earlier. The railway was in good condition because of the continued maintenance.

Unlike other Swiss mountain lines, the BRB was not electrified and this made the railway a special attraction as from 1953 to 1990 it was the only steam-operated line in Switzerland. Although other Swiss mountain railways offer special &quot;steam&quot; trips, this is the only line to offer a full steam service, the Diesel locomotive only being used for additional trains and for light traffic periods.

== Route ==
The BRB is long with a maximum gradient of 1 in 4 (25%) and includes five tunnels. It begins in Brienz at above sea level, from a terminus opposite the Brienz station of the Zentralbahn company&#x27;s Brünig line. Also nearby is the quay used by the BLS AG shipping services on Lake Brienz.

The railway is single track with three passing loops. The first passing loop is at Geldried, above sea level. The halfway passing loop of the line is at Planalp station at above sea level (the only stop on the line). The older steam locomotives stop to take water. The third passing loop is at Oberstafel, above sea level.

The upper terminus of the line is at Rothorn Kulm station at above sea level, a little below the summit of the mountain.

A popular hiking trail runs between the summit station, and the Brünig-Hasliberg station at the point where the Brünig line crosses the Brünig Pass.

== Locomotives and rolling stock ==
All steam locomotives are Class H2/3, indicating that two of the three axles are driven, giving a wheel arrangement (Whyte System) of 0-4-2. The older locomotives are a side tank, &quot;kneeling cow&quot; design of a standard SLM product. The modern steam locomotives use an efficient &quot;light oil&quot; fired steam technology and were built by SLM (former Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works) of Winterthur.

A prototype Diesel locomotive, class Hm2/2, number 8, was delivered in 1973, but sold to the Chemin de fer Montreux-Glion-Rochers-de-Naye in 1995 as their Number 4. New Diesel locomotives were constructed by Ferdinand Steck Maschinenfabrik and are of (Whyte System) 0-4-0 wheel arrangement to a &quot;kneeling cow&quot; design.


== Timetable ==

The Brienz Rothorn Railway operated 7 days per week from June 4 to October 23, 2016, all the way up to the Rothorn. They tried to ensure that all their services are steam-powered.

<doc id="648505" wikidata="Q5571242" url="?curid=648505" title="Glomerulus (olfaction)">
<text>The glomerulus (: glomeruli) is a spherical structure located in the olfactory bulb of the brain where synapses form between the terminals of the olfactory nerve and the dendrites of mitral, periglomerular and tufted cells. Each glomerulus is surrounded by a heterogeneous population of juxtaglomerular neurons (that include periglomerular, short axon, and external tufted cells) and glial cells.

All glomeruli are located near the surface of the olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulb also includes a portion of the anterior olfactory nucleus, the cells of which contribute fibers to the olfactory tract. They are the initial sites for synaptic processing of odor information coming from the nose. A glomerulus is made up of a globular tangle of axons from the olfactory receptor neurons, and dendrites from the mitral and tufted cells, as well as, from cells that surround the glomerulus such as the external tufted cells, periglomerular cells, short axon cells, and astrocytes. In mammals, glomeruli typically range between 50-120 μm in diameter and number between 1100 and 2400 depending on the species, with roughly between 1100 and 1200 in humans. The number of glomeruli in a human decreases with age; in humans that are over 80 they are nearly absent. Each glomerulus is composed of two compartments, the olfactory nerve zone and the non-olfactory nerve zone. The olfactory nerve zone is composed of preterminals and terminals of the olfactory nerve and is where the olfactory receptor cells make synapses on their targets. The non-olfactory nerve zone is composed of the dendritic processes of intrinsic neurons and is where dendrodendritic interactions between intrinsic neurons occur.

==Structure==
Glomeruli are important waystations in the pathway from the nose to the olfactory cortex and have been found to be critical for odorant signal transduction. The olfactory receptor neurons (ORN), which originate in the nasal epithelium express only one type of olfactory receptor (OR). These ORNs then project their axons to the olfactory bulb. In the olfactory bulb, the ORNs synapse with termination in the glomeruli. Each glomerulus receives input from olfactory receptor neurons expressing only one type of olfactory receptor. The glomerular activation patterns within the olfactory bulb are thought to represent the quality of the odor being detected. These activation patterns of glomeruli can change due to changes in airflow rate and odor concentration in the mucus layer of the nasal cavity. A certain odorant can activate a glomeruli strongly whilst affecting others with less efficiency to very little at all. Linda Buck and Richard Axel were awarded a Nobel prize in 2004 for heavily influencing the working out of the genetic basis for this Olfactory coding.

The current dogma is that axons from all ORNs expressing the same receptor converge onto one or two glomeruli of a possible 1800 glomeruli in each olfactory bulb. As the axons of the ORNs migrate towards their specific glomeruli they often overshoot into neighboring glomeruli. Thus, a glomerulus representing a specific OR develops slowly and involves considerable axonal reorganization in order to achieve the highly topographical projection observed in adult mice.

==Function==
The glomerulus is the basic unit in the odor map of the olfactory bulb. Each odor activates a different pattern of glomeruli, such that, simply by analyzing the different sets of activated glomeruli, one could, in theory, decode the identity of the odor. This odor map, however, is modified by the circuitry within the olfactory bulb so that the spiking pattern of the second-order mitral cells is usually different from that of the olfactory sensory neurons.

==Other species==
===Glomerulus in dogs===
The glomerulus process in dogs is divided in 3 parts: signal acquisition, signal transduction, and signal processing. Some dogs have as many as 100 times more ORNs than humans do, producing a correspondingly sharpened ability to detect and discriminate among millions of odors. Characteristics of these stages include: the role of olfactory plume and sniffing, the continuous renewal of Glomerulus receptors throughout the life cycle, and the relationship between the olfactory neuron and the glomerulus, and finally, the synthetic nature of glomerulus coding.

===Glomerulus in fish===
One of the most distinctive features of fish olfaction is that it takes place entirely in the aquatic environment. The carrier of stimulant is water and therefore the chemicals must be soluble in water. The olfactory epithelium of fish consists of three cell types, like other vertebrates. These three cell types are the receptor cells, supporting cells and basal cells.

Fish glomerulus differs from the mammalian glomerulus in terms of the number of dendrites that it receives from the mitral cells. In a mammalian olfactory system, a single dendrite from a mitral cell enters a single glomerulus. However, in fish, one or more dendrites from mitral cells enter one or more glomerulus.

<doc id="648512" wikidata="Q6953753" url="?curid=648512" title="NFL Street">
<text>NFL Street is an American football video game developed by EA Tiburon and published by Electronic Arts under the EA Sports BIG label. It was released for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox on January 13, 2004. Barry Sanders of the Detroit Lions, Shannon Sharpe of the Denver Broncos, and Ricky Williams of the Miami Dolphins appear on the cover. The game was followed by &quot;NFL Street 2&quot; and &quot;NFL Street 3&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Similar to the &quot;Blitz series&quot;, &quot;NFL Street&quot; is seven-on-seven American football, modeled after street football. NFL players wear street clothing instead of helmets and uniforms, though players can wear football jerseys. Like other American football games, it utilizes basic football rules, but without fouls, penalties, or injuries, naturally leading to more aggressive gameplay than its real-life model.

One important feature in the game is &quot;style points&quot;, which the player can earn by successfully completing style moves (which includes making a huge play or taunting the other team during the game). Gaining enough style points will earn the player a &quot;Gamebreaker&quot;, which lasts for the entire drive. The Gamebreaker concept was adopted from &quot;NBA Street&quot;.

An offensive Gamebreaker allows the player to plow through defenders and easily score a touchdown. On defense, it allows the player to easily get through their opponents blockers, cause fumbles, and possibly create a turnover. While difficult, it is possible to cancel a Gamebreaker by stopping your opponent from scoring. Additionally a Gamebreaker may be canceled if the player activates his while his opponent&#x27;s is already activated. In this situation, both Gamebreakers are canceled. It is also possible to stop a defensive Gamebreaker by running out of bounds.

===Game modes===
Quick Game — In this mode you select a team and play a quick game against either the computer or a friend. The scoring system can be in touchdowns or style points, depending on the choice of the player.&lt;br&gt;
Pickup Game — A Pickup Game is the same as a Quick Game, but instead of choosing a team, you and your opponent create teams from a pool of around 40 NFL players, some of which are Legends. In game, the teams are referred as &quot;Team One&quot; and &quot;Team Two&quot;. Regulation Pickup Games of NFL Street allow each team one redraft (also called a &quot;Re&quot;) if one team believes the random assortment of players available in the draft are not up to par. However, if both teams have used their redraft, another redraft can be done if both teams dislike the draft. This is known in the NFL Street community as &quot;Mutual Garb.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
NFL Challenge — This is the main mode in the game. You create a team, from logo to players height, and go through a series of challenges against other teams, unlocking new football stadiums, teams, equipment, and development points for improving your team by completing several challenges that vary in their difficulty&lt;br&gt;
All NFL Pickup — To unlock this mode, you must first beat the NFL Challenge mode. The same features apply as in Pickup Game, but instead of a 40 player pool, you can select from any of the players in the game, including Legends. You can choose 1-2 players from any team except from the cheat code teams.

===Rosters===
The rosters are based on the 2003 NFL roster, with some earlier players as NFL Legends.

==Soundtrack==
The original score was done by turntablist group The X-Ecutioners, along with several songs that were part of pre-album releases for other artists on the soundtrack. 
#Baby D - &quot;It&#x27;s Goin Down&quot; (Pre-album release)

==Reception==
By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;NFL Street&quot; had sold 950,000 copies and earned $37 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 58th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined console sales of &quot;NFL Street&quot; games released in the 2000s reached 2 million units in the United States by July 2006.

&quot;NFL Street&quot; received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. It received a runner-up position in &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2004 &quot;Best Alternative Sports Game&quot; award category across all platforms, losing to &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot;.

&quot;Maxim&quot; gave the game all five stars and said the player can &quot;dispense with kicking and doodle-heavy playbooks, and deploy between-the-leg laterals and double reverses, plus a mess of excellent unsportsmanlike, showboating taunts.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the Xbox version a score of nine out of ten and said, &quot;In the surprisingly good single-player &quot;NFL Challenge&quot; mode, you earn points to build a franchise, choosing everything from the players&#x27; mutated genes (10 attributes, plus size) to their speed-enhancing sneakers. &#x27;Cause it ain&#x27;t all about the steroids.&quot; However, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game a B and said, &quot;This pigskin sim fumbles by forcing players to run their amateur team against the pros in order to unlock better fields and additional players - a clear case of unnecessary roughness.&quot; &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it &quot;a fun, simplistic diversion, especially with a group of friends. However, once you&#x27;ve seen all the style moves it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of much deeper football games like EA&#x27;s own &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;.&quot;

David Leonard of PopMatters critiqued the game&#x27;s depiction of African-American men, comparing the &quot;emphasis on savagery, violence and animalistic features&quot; to those used in the controversial first-person shooter &quot;Ethnic Cleansing&quot;.

<doc id="648513" wikidata="Q5968150" url="?curid=648513" title="I/O bound">
<text>In computer science, I/O bound refers to a condition in which the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed, which can be juxtaposed with being CPU bound. This circumstance arises when the rate at which data is requested is slower than the rate it is consumed or, in other words, more time is spent requesting data than processing it.

==I/O bound as an inherent problem in computing==
The I/O bound state has been identified as a problem in computing almost since its inception. The Von Neumann architecture, which is employed by many computing devices, this involves multiple possible solutions such as implementing a logically separate central processor unit which along with storing the instructions of the program also retrieves actual data usually from main memory and makes use of this more accessible data for working. When the process is terminated it writes back the results to the original storage (usually the main memory).

Since data must be moved between the CPU and memory along a bus which has a limited data transfer rate, there exists a condition that is known as the Von Neumann bottleneck. Put simply, this means that the data bandwidth between the CPU and memory tends to limit the overall speed of computation. In terms of the actual technology that makes up a computer, the Von Neumann Bottleneck predicts that it is easier to make the CPU perform calculations faster than it is to supply it with data at the necessary rate for this to be possible.

In recent history, the Von Neumann bottleneck has become more apparent. The design philosophy of modern computers is based upon a physically separate CPU and main memory. It is possible to make the CPU run at a high data transfer rate because data is moved between locations inside them across tiny distances. The physical separation between CPU and main memory, however, requires a data bus to move data across
comparatively long distances of centimetres or more. The problem of making this part of the system operate sufficiently fast to keep up with the CPU has been a great challenge to designers.

==I/O bound as a practical problem==
The I/O bound state is considered undesirable because it means that the CPU must stall its operation while waiting for data to be loaded or unloaded from main memory or secondary storage. With faster computation speed being the primary goal of new computer designs and components such as the CPU and memory being expensive, there is a strong imperative to avoid I/O bound states and eliminating them can yield a more economic improvement in performance than upgrading the CPU or memory.

&quot;As CPU gets faster, processes tend to get more I/O-bound&quot;

Or in simpler terms:

&quot;As CPU gets faster, processes tend to not increase in speed in proportion to CPU speed because they get more I/O-bound.&quot;

This means that I/O bound processes are slower than non-I/O bound processes, not faster. This is due to increases in the rate of data processing in the core, while the rate at which data is transferred from storage to the processor does not increase with it. As CPU clock speed increases, allowing more instructions to be executed in a given time window, the limiting factor of effective execution is the rate at which instructions can be delivered to the processor from storage, and sent from the processor to their destination. In short, programs naturally shift to being more and more I/O bound.

==Comparison with CPU-bound==
Assume we have one CPU-bound process and many I/O-bound processes. As the processes flow around the system, the following scenario may result. The CPU-bound process will get and hold the CPU. During this time, all the other processes will finish their I/O and will move into the ready queue, waiting for the CPU. While the processes wait in the ready queue, the I/O devices are idle. Eventually, the CPU-bound process finishes its CPU burst and moves to an I/O device. All the I/O-bound processes, which have short CPU bursts, execute quickly and move back to the I/O queues. At this point, the CPU sits idle. The CPU-bound process will then move back to the ready queue and be allocated the CPU. Again, all the I/O processes end up waiting in the ready queue until the CPU-bound process is done. There is a convoy effect as all the other processes wait for the one big process to get off the CPU. This effect results in lower CPU and device utilization than might be possible if the shorter processes were allowed to go first.

<text>The Schynige Platte Railway (, SPB) is a mountain railway in the Bernese Highlands area of Switzerland, which connects the town of Wilderswil, near Interlaken, with the famous wildflower gardens of the Schynige Platte.

An impressively and varied natural landscape unfolds on the journey, including forests, Alpine pastures and views of the Bernese Oberland. Towards the top of the line, there are also views of the imposing peaks of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. The line opened, using steam traction, in May 1893, and was electrified in 1914.

The line is owned by the &quot;Berner Oberland-Bahnen AG&quot;, a company that also owns the Berner Oberland-Bahn. Through that company it is part of the &quot;Allianz - Jungfrau Top of Europe&quot; marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Wengernalpbahn, Jungfraubahn, Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen–Mürren, Harderbahn, and Firstbahn.

==History==

The key milestones in the history of the line are:

*1890 The concession for the line was given and the company is founded on 16 September.
*1891 Construction starts.
*1893 A train with special guests reaches the top on 5 May and the line opens to the public on 14 June.
*1896 The Berner Oberland-Bahn become the new owners.
*1913 The first electric trial run operates on 15 October.
*1914 Public electric services start on 9 May.
*1928 The Schynige Platte Alpine Garden opens on the Schynige Platte.
*1964 The Schynige Platte Railway receives 4 locomotives from the Wengernalpbahn.
*1970 The Schynige Platte Railway receives 2 more locomotives from the Wengernalpbahn.
*1978 The Schynige Platte Railway receives another locomotive from the Wengernalpbahn.
*2001 Teddyland opens on the Schynige Platte on 7 June.

==Route==


The Schynige Platte Railway commences from Wilderswil station at an altitude of , where it connects with the line of the Berner Oberland-Bahn (BOB), which operates to Interlaken Ost, Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald. Wilderswil is within the built-up area around Interlaken, and buses also provide a connection from the station to the town centre and Interlaken West station.

The line initially runs alongside the BOB for just over before crossing the Lütschine river and starting its climb up the valley side. Initially it passes through forest, with a passing loop at Rotenegg at an altitude of . The forest is followed by alpine pastures which offer views of the Bernese Oberland including the town of Interlaken bracketed by Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. Another passing loop is located at Breitlauenen station, the line&#x27;s only intermediate station at an altitude of .

In the final stretch of the ascent, views open up of the glistening giants of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau mountains to the south. The line terminates at Schynige Platte station at an altitude of , after a journey of and a height gain of . The Schynige Platte alpine botanical garden, a hotel and a mountain restaurant are all located near the summit station.

==Operation==
The Schynige Platte Railway is built to 800 mm gauge ( gauge) and is electrified using a 1500 V DC overhead supply. It is a rack railway, using the Riggenbach rack with a maximum gradient of 25% (1 in 4). The line&#x27;s depot and workshops are located adjacent to Wilderswil station.

The line is timetabled to only operate in summer months, from the beginning of June to the middle of October. As the upper section of the route, between Breitlauenen and the summit, is subject to heavy winter snowfall and occasional avalanches, the overhead catenary on this section is dismantled after the last train of the year, and reinstated before the first train of the next year can run. The process of removal or replacement normally takes a team of six employees a day to complete, and employs the line&#x27;s one remaining steam locomotive.

The line provides some 15 return services per day, with services every 40 minutes and a journey time of 52 minutes. Any given service may be operated by a convoy of more than one train, with each train usually comprising an electric rack locomotive and two coaches. The locomotive always operates at the lower end of the train, pushing the train up the mountain and leading it down.

==Rolling stock==
The line still operates one of its original steam locomotives, together with the four electric locomotives built for the line&#x27;s electrification. A number of additional similar locomotives, together with matching coaches, were bought from the Wengernalpbahn but had (until the recent delivery of additional train sets) often returned to this line to help in winter sports traffic.

The line uses, or has used, the following locomotives:


In 1992, the company started a rebuilding program for 12 coaches. On old underframes, brought to a unified length of over buffers, Ramseyer+Jenzer built a new steel body in the old compartment style. These coaches carry the numbers 41–52 (41–42 sit on the original underframes number 2 and 4, the others on underframes ex-WAB). Of the original stock numbers 6–8 (1894, 1924, 1929) with open compartments and 21–22 (1929, 1931) fully closed compartment coaches were kept and complemented with numbers 3 (open, 1893), 23 and 24 (closed, 1898, 1901) ex-WAB (last WAB numbers 3, 22, 24). This allows to build 10 consists of a locomotive with 2 coaches (see above, Operations). Original coaches 1 and 5 were scrapped in 1970 and 68, number 3 rebuilt as flat car (new number 91).

<doc id="648521" wikidata="Q7808975" url="?curid=648521" title="Tipstaff">
<text>A tipstaff is an officer of a court or, in some countries, a law clerk to a judge. The duties of the position vary from country to country. It is also the name of a symbolic rod, which represents the authority of the tipstaff or other officials such as senior police officers.

==History==
The office of Tipstaff was originally military in nature. The Ordinances for Calais Act 1535 (27 Hen. 8. c. 63) stipulating the personnel required to man the English castle at Calais said that there should be:

The same act also gave instructions for selecting a replacement should a Tippstaff die in service.

This appointment to be confirmed by the Comptroller and Treasurer of the Castle.

The office then seems to have transferred to early forms of law enforcement. In 1555 when Reverend Rowland Taylor was burned at the stake during the reign of Queen Mary I for his religious views that were contrary to those of Lord Chancellor Gardiner. &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot; states that Taylor would have spoken to the people but as soon as he opened his mouth the yeoman of the guard thrust a tipstaff into his mouth, and would in no way permit him to speak. This is also quoted in &quot;Five English Reformers&quot; by J. C. Ryle.

And by 1570 it has also attained some ceremonial functions, &quot;The Knight Marshall with all hys tippe staves&quot;.

By the middle of the nineteenth century the term has transferred to a baton wielded by members of the embryonic police authorities, officers would arrest people by beating them with a tipped staff or stave. The staff was made of wood or metal or both, topped with a crown. The crown, which unscrewed, could be removed to reveal inside the hollow staff a warrant appointing the holder to their position of authority. Some staves were definitely a means of protection and this is where the present day policeman&#x27;s baton, or truncheon, originates.

Examples remain at the Royal Courts of Justice and the Metropolitan Police Heritage Centre in London and vary depending on the type and rank of officer. These tipstaves were first carried in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. When detectives (in plain clothes) were first authorised, the tipstaves issued to plainclothes officers from 1867 were re-issued in 1870 and engraved &quot;Metropolitan Police officer in plain clothes&quot;.

The staff kept at the Royal Courts of Justice is now only used on ceremonial occasions. It is 12 inches in length and made of ebony decorated with a silver crown and three bands of silver engraved with the Royal Arms at the top. Around the middle is inscribed &quot;Amos Hawkins, Tipstaff Courts of Chancery&quot; and around the bottom is inscribed &quot;Appointed 14th January, 1884, by the Rt. Hon. The Earl of Selborne, L.C.&quot; with another coat of Royal Arms. The date was that on which this staff was first used, soon after the law courts were opened. Prior to 1884, each tipstaff had his own staff, which he retained when he retired.
==As a symbol==
The emblem of two crossed tipstaves within a wreath appears on the rank insignia of senior police officers in several Commonwealth countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia. In Canada, the emblem is used for the most senior officers of the Ontario Provincial Police and Royal Newfoundland Constabulary.

==Current usage==
===Australia===

In Australia, a tipstaff is roughly equivalent to a law clerk in the United States. The term is used principally in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and in the County Court of Victoria.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, a tipstaff is a personal aide to a judge. The role of tipstaff has been replaced by that of judicial assistant for judges appointed after 2011. No new tipstaves have been recruited since 2011 and only a small number remain.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
There are currently two tipstaves in England and Wales: one is an officer of the Royal Borough of Kingston and the other an officer of the High Court of England and Wales, appointed under section 27 of the Courts Act 1971. It is the latter to which this section refers.

The High Court tipstaff may appoint three assistants and can call on any constable, bailiff or member of the public to assist in carrying out their duties. Their jurisdiction extends throughout England and Wales. They are authorised to force entry if necessary, and will have a police officer present to prevent breach of the peace. The relevant territorial police force is informed of arrests.

Sometimes a local bailiff or police will detain a person in custody until the tipstaff arrives to collect them and take them to court or prison. Pentonville Prison (for civil offenders) is obliged to take into custody‚ no matter what the circumstances‚ anybody taken there by the tipstaff. A tipstaff may make the same demands of the custody suite within the Royal Courts of Justice itself, and they are obliged to take into custody any individual he brings there.

The tipstaff heads a procession of the lord chancellor and judges at the start of the legal year‚ preceding them with their staff as a symbol of authority and law enforcement. They also lead the lord mayor from their golden coach to the lord chief justice&#x27;s court for the &quot;swearing in&quot; of the lord mayor‚ afterwards attending the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Banquet, having led the lord chancellor into the guildhall. The black uniform‚ only worn on ceremonial occasions‚ is based on that of a Victorian police inspector. They wear a black hat with gold braid trimmings and jacket with silver buttons‚ a wing collar with a white bow tie and white gloves. The tipstaff is the only person authorised to make an arrest within the precincts of the Royal Courts of Justice.

Every applicable order made in the High Court is addressed to the tipstaff: &quot;I hereby command you the Tipstaff and your assistants in His Majesty&#x27;s name to take and safely convey and deliver the said ... to the Governor of His Majesty&#x27;s Prison ...&quot;(as in the case of making an arrest). The majority of their work involves taking children into custody (i.e. a place of safety)‚ including cases of child abduction abroad.

In child abduction cases, there may be a &quot;seek and locate&quot; order backed by a bench warrant ordering any person with knowledge of the child to give that information to the tipstaff or to their deputy or assistants. Related orders may require the alleged abductor to hand their passport and other travel documents to the tipstaff, and order the tipstaff to take the child and deliver them to a designated place. There may also be a &quot;port alert&quot; executed by the tipstaff, to help prevent the child being taken abroad.

In the case of children who have been declared a ward of court i.e. where the court is acting &quot;in loco parentis&quot;, a tipstaff has a role in ensuring that those children are delivered to the locations specified by the court.

====Northern Ireland====
Tipstaves and court criers in Northern Ireland have no enforcement role, but act as personal assistants to high court and county court judges.

===United States===
In some states of the United States, a tipstaff is called a tipstave and is responsible for courtroom decorum. Their position is similar to that of a bailiff. The Civil Division of the Municipal Court of Philadelphia employs tipstaves as clerks to the court. The Criminal Trial Division employs tipstaves in positions commonly referred to as court officers.

<text>Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky (; ; – ) was a Russian mathematician and geometer, known primarily for his work on hyperbolic geometry, otherwise known as Lobachevskian geometry, and also for his fundamental study on Dirichlet integrals, known as the Lobachevsky integral formula.

William Kingdon Clifford called Lobachevsky the &quot;Copernicus of Geometry&quot; due to the revolutionary character of his work.

== Biography ==
Nikolai Lobachevsky was born either in or near the city of Nizhny Novgorod in the Russian Empire (now in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia) in 1792 to parents of Russian and Polish origin – Ivan Maksimovich Lobachevsky and Praskovia Alexandrovna Lobachevskaya. He was one of three children. When he was seven, his father, a clerk in a land-surveying office, died, and Nikolai moved with his mother to Kazan. Nikolai Lobachevsky attended Kazan Gymnasium from 1802, graduating in 1807, and then received a scholarship to Kazan University, which had been founded just three years earlier in 1804.

At Kazan University, Lobachevsky was influenced by professor Johann Christian Martin Bartels, a former teacher and friend of the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). Lobachevsky received a Master of Science in physics and mathematics in 1811. In 1814 he became a lecturer at Kazan University, in 1816 he was promoted to associate professor. In 1822, at the age of 30, he became a full professor, teaching mathematics, physics, and astronomy. He served in many administrative positions and became the rector of Kazan University in 1827. In 1832, he married Varvara Alexeyevna Moiseyeva. They had a large number of children (eighteen according to his son&#x27;s memoirs, though only seven apparently survived into adulthood). He was dismissed from the university in 1846, ostensibly due to his deteriorating health: by the early 1850s, he was nearly blind and unable to walk. He died in poverty in 1856 and was buried in Arskoe Cemetery, Kazan.

In 1811, in his student days, Lobachevsky was accused by a vengeful supervisor of atheism

==Career==
Lobachevsky&#x27;s main achievement is the development (independently from János Bolyai) of a non-Euclidean geometry, also referred to as Lobachevskian geometry. Before him, mathematicians were trying to deduce Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate from other axioms. Euclid&#x27;s fifth is a rule in Euclidean geometry which states (in John Playfair&#x27;s reformulation) that for any given line and point not on the line, there is only one line through the point not intersecting the given line. Lobachevsky would instead develop a geometry in which the fifth postulate was not true. This idea was first reported on February 23 (Feb. 11, O.S.), 1826 to the session of the department of physics and mathematics, and this research was printed in the periodical &#x27;Kazan University Course Notes&#x27; as &quot;On the Origin of Geometry&quot; (&quot;О началах геометрии&quot;) between 1829 and 1830. In 1829 Lobachevsky wrote a paper about his ideas called &quot;A Concise Outline of the Foundations of Geometry&quot; that was published by the &quot;Kazan Messenger&quot; but was rejected when it was submitted to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences for publication.

The non-Euclidean geometry that Lobachevsky developed is referred to as hyperbolic geometry. Lobachevsky replaced Playfair&#x27;s axiom with the statement that for any given point there exists &quot;more than&quot; one line that can be extended through that point and run parallel to another line of which that point is not part. He developed the angle of parallelism which depends on the distance the point is off the given line. In hyperbolic geometry the sum of angles in a hyperbolic triangle must be less than 180 degrees. Non-Euclidean geometry stimulated the development of differential geometry which has many applications. Hyperbolic geometry is frequently referred to as &quot;Lobachevskian geometry&quot; or &quot;Bolyai–Lobachevskian geometry&quot;.

Some mathematicians and historians have wrongly claimed that Lobachevsky in his studies in non-Euclidean geometry was influenced by Gauss, which is untrue. Gauss himself appreciated Lobachevsky&#x27;s published works highly, but they never had personal correspondence between them prior to the publication. Although three people—Gauss, Lobachevsky and Bolyai—can be credited with discovery of hyperbolic geometry, Gauss never published his ideas, and Lobachevsky was the first to present his views to the world mathematical community.

Lobachevsky&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Geometriya&quot; was completed in 1823, but was not published in its exact original form until 1909, long after he had died. Lobachevsky was also the author of &quot;New Foundations of Geometry&quot; (1835–1838). He also wrote &quot;Geometrical Investigations on the Theory of Parallels&quot; (1840) and &quot;Pangeometry&quot; (1855).

Another of Lobachevsky&#x27;s achievements was developing a method for the approximation of the roots of algebraic equations. This method is now known as the Dandelin–Gräffe method, named after two other mathematicians who discovered it independently. In Russia, it is called the Lobachevsky method. Lobachevsky gave the definition of a function as a correspondence between two sets of real numbers (Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet gave the same definition independently soon after Lobachevsky).

==Impact==
E. T. Bell wrote about Lobachevsky&#x27;s influence on the following development of mathematics in his 1937 book &quot;Men of Mathematics&quot;:

The boldness of his challenge and its successful outcome have inspired mathematicians and scientists in general to challenge other &quot;axioms&quot; or accepted &quot;truths&quot;, for example the &quot;law&quot; of causality which, for centuries, have seemed as necessary to straight thinking as Euclid&#x27;s postulate appeared until Lobachevsky discarded it. The full impact of the Lobachevskian method of challenging axioms has probably yet to be felt. It is no exaggeration to call Lobachevsky the Copernicus of Geometry, for geometry is only a part of the vaster domain which he renovated; it might even be just to designate him as a Copernicus of all thought.

==Honors==
* 1858 Lobachevskij, an asteroid discovered in 1972, was named in his honour.
* The lunar crater Lobachevsky was named in his honor.
* Lobachevsky Prize, a mathematics award by the Kazan State University.
* The Lobachevsky University was named in his honor.
* A street in Ploiesti, Romania was named in his honor.

==In popular culture==

A fictional mathematician named &quot;Lobachevsky&quot; is the subject of songwriter/mathematician Tom Lehrer&#x27;s humorous song &quot;Lobachevsky&quot; from his 1953 &quot;Songs by Tom Lehrer&quot; album. In the song, Lehrer portrays a Russian mathematician who sings about how Lobachevsky influenced him: &quot;And who made me a big success / and brought me wealth and fame? / Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name.&quot; Lobachevsky&#x27;s secret to mathematical success is given as &quot;Plagiarize!&quot;, as long as one is always careful to &quot;call it, please, research&quot;. According to Lehrer, the song is &quot;not intended as a slur on [Lobachevsky&#x27;s] character&quot; and the name was chosen &quot;solely for prosodic reasons&quot;.

In Poul Anderson&#x27;s 1969 fantasy novella &quot;Operation Changeling&quot; – which was later expanded into the novel &quot;Operation Chaos&quot; (1971) – a group of sorcerers navigate a non-Euclidean universe with the assistance of the ghosts of Lobachevsky and Bolyai.

Roger Zelazny&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Doorways in the Sand&quot; contains a poem dedicated to Lobachevsky.

In the sitcom &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, &quot;Dick and the Single Girl&quot; (season 2 episode 24) originally aired on May 11 1997, Sonja Umdahl (Christine Baranski), a forgotten colleague who is transferring to teach at another university, gives as the reason behind her departure that Columbia is the only holder of Nikolai Lobachevsky&#x27;s manuscripts.

<doc id="648529" wikidata="Q130483754" url="?curid=648529" title="Killing of Nick Berg">
<text>Nicholas Evan Berg (April 2, 1978 – May 7, 2004) was an American freelance radio-tower repairman who went to Iraq after the United States&#x27; invasion of Iraq. He was abducted and beheaded according to a video released in May 2004 by Islamist militants in response to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse involving the United States Army and Iraqi prisoners. The CIA claimed Berg was murdered by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The decapitation video was released on the internet, reportedly from London to a Malaysian-hosted homepage by the Islamist organization Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad.

== Early life and education ==
Berg was born in Charlotte, North Carolina and grew up in West Whiteland Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. He was referred to as a &quot;religious Jew.&quot;

Berg graduated from Henderson High School in West Chester in 1996. In 1996, he was a student at Cornell University but later dropped out. He took classes at Drexel University in 1998, and, in 1999, attended summer sessions on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. At some point, Berg took a class at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. He never earned a college degree.

In 2002, with family members, Berg created Prometheus Methods Tower Service. He inspected and rebuilt communication antennas, and had previously visited Kenya and Uganda on similar projects. Berg set up a subsidiary of his company, Prometheus Tower Services, Inc., in Kenya.

== Travels and detention ==
Berg first arrived in Iraq on December 21, 2003, and made arrangements to secure contract work for his company. He also went to the northern city of Mosul, visiting an Iraqi man whose brother had been married to Berg&#x27;s late aunt. Leaving on February 1, 2004, he returned to Iraq on March 14, 2004, only to find that the work he was promised was unavailable. Throughout his time in Iraq, he maintained frequent contact with his family in the United States by telephone and email.

Berg had intended to return to the United States on March 30, 2004, but he was detained in Mosul on March 24. His family claims that he was turned over to U.S. officials and held for 13 days without access to legal counsel. FBI agents visited his parents to confirm his identity on March 31, 2004, but he was not immediately released. After his parents filed suit in federal court in Philadelphia on April 5, 2004, claiming that he was being held illegally, he was released from custody. He said that he had not been mistreated during his confinement. The U.S. maintains that at no time was Berg in coalition custody, but rather that he was held by Iraqi forces. The Mosul police deny they ever arrested Berg, and Berg&#x27;s family has turned over an email from the U.S. consul stating &quot;I have confirmed that your son, Nick, is being detained by the U.S. military in Mosul.&quot; According to the Associated Press, Berg was released from custody on April 6, 2004 and advised by U.S. officials to take a flight out of Iraq, with their assistance. Berg is said to have refused this offer and traveled to Baghdad, where he stayed at the Al-Fanar Hotel. His family last heard from him on April 9, 2004. Berg had his last contact with U.S. officials on April 10, 2004 and did not return again to his hotel after that date. He was interviewed for filmmaker Michael Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. Moore chose not to use the footage of his interview with Berg, but instead shared it with Berg&#x27;s family following his death.

== Disappearance ==
Berg&#x27;s family became concerned after not hearing from him for several days. Although a U.S. State Department investigator looked into Berg&#x27;s disappearance, official government inquiries produced no leads. His family, frustrated with what they say was a lack of action by the U.S. government, also hired a private investigator and contacted both their Congressional delegation and the Red Cross in search of information. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; it is unclear how Berg came to be kidnapped.

== Death ==

Berg&#x27;s body was found decapitated on May 8, 2004, on a Baghdad overpass by a U.S. military patrol. Berg&#x27;s family was informed of his death two days later. Military sources stated publicly at the time that Berg&#x27;s body showed &quot;signs of trauma&quot;, but did not disclose that he had been decapitated.

On May 11, 2004, the website of the militant jihadist forum Muntada al-Ansar posted a video with the opening title of &quot;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi slaughters an American&quot;, which shows Berg being decapitated. The video is about five and a half minutes long. The video shows Nick Berg, seated, facing the camera and his captors standing behind him also facing the camera. Berg is wearing an orange jumpsuit, similar to ones worn by prisoners in U.S. custody. His captors are all masked, their identities concealed. He identifies himself: &quot;My name is Nick Berg, my father&#x27;s name is Michael, my mother&#x27;s name is Suzanne. I have a brother and sister, David and Sarah. I live in West Chester, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia.&quot; A lengthy statement is read aloud by a masked man. The masked men then converge on Berg. Two of them hold him down, while one decapitates him with a knife.

=== Perpetrators ===
The video title claims the decapitator was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, but this can not be determined as all the men are masked. Berg screams as the masked men shout &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;. After the head is severed, one of the men displays the head to the camera, then lays it down on the decapitated body. During the video, the masked man reading the statement said the killing was in revenge for the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. The man says Muslims should seek vengeance for Abu Ghraib, and that the Muslim clergy had been complacent. The man also threatens further deaths, and makes specific threats to U.S. President George W. Bush and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.

Media in the United States and around the world grappled with the question of how much graphics to print. The &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; showed an image in which the killer holds Berg&#x27;s severed head, while &quot;Seattle Times&quot; only displayed the image of the killer. British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; urged restraint, arguing the video was propaganda and publishing images from it &quot;plays into the hands&quot; of terrorists.

===Reactions===
Berg&#x27;s killing was condemned by the Arab League, and United Nations, as well as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and UAE. Many others in the Muslim world also condemned the killing, and BBC journalist Paul Wood found that the &quot;Arab street&quot; condemned the killing of Berg, saw it as contrary to Islam, and saw it as a reaction to US prison abuses.

== Encounter with Zacarias Moussaoui ==
On May 14, 2004, it was revealed that Nick Berg had come up during the U.S. government&#x27;s investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui, a 9/11 conspirator. Berg&#x27;s email address had been used by Moussaoui prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks. According to Berg&#x27;s father, Nick Berg had a chance encounter with an acquaintance of Moussaoui on a bus in Norman, Oklahoma. This person had asked to borrow Berg&#x27;s laptop computer to send an email. Berg gave the details of his own email account and password, which were later used by Moussaoui. The FBI found that Berg had no direct terrorism connections or direct link with Moussaoui.

== Arrests and confessions ==
On May 14, 2004, citing &quot;Iraq sources&quot;, &quot;Sky News&quot; reported that four people had been arrested for the murder. Two were later released. Alternatively, on July 5, 2004, &quot;Sky News&quot; reported that four men were arrested in connection with the Nick Berg decapitation. Suspects arrested for Berg&#x27;s killing were former members of Fedayeen Saddam paramilitary group.

On August 5, 2004, &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; published a feature story by Sara Daniel detailing her meeting with Abu Rashid, a leader of the Mujahideen Council in Fallujah. He claims that he killed Nick Berg, Kim Sun-il and Iraqis who collaborated with US forces. He also states that they attempted a prisoner exchange with Berg but were rebuffed by American officials.

<text>The Mönch (, German: &quot;monk&quot;) at is a mountain in the Bernese Alps, in Switzerland. Together with the Eiger and the Jungfrau, it forms a highly recognisable group of mountains, visible from far away.

The Mönch lies on the border between the cantons of Valais and Bern, and forms part of a mountain ridge between the Jungfrau and Jungfraujoch to the west, and the Eiger to the east. It is west of Mönchsjoch, a pass at , Mönchsjoch Hut, and north of the Jungfraufirn and Ewigschneefäld, two affluents of the Great Aletsch Glacier. The north side of the Mönch forms a step wall above the Lauterbrunnen valley.

The Jungfrau railway tunnel runs right under the summit, at an elevation of approximately .

The summit was first climbed on record on 15 August 1857 by Christian Almer, Christian Kaufmann (1831-1861), Ulrich Kaufmann and Sigismund Porges.

<text>The University of Mount Union is a private liberal arts university in Alliance, Ohio, United States. Founded in 1846, the university was affiliated with the Methodist Church until 2019. It had an enrollment of 2,100 students as of 2023.

==History==
Mount Union was founded in 1846 by Orville Nelson Hartshorn as the Select School as &quot;a place where men and women could be educated with equal opportunity, science would parallel the humanities, and there would be no distinction due to race, color, or sex.&quot; Only three years after opening, in 1849, it was renamed as the Mount Union Seminary. 

The school would not be chartered under Ohio state law until June 9, 1856, after which it adopted the name Mount Union College.

In approximately 1911, Scio College of Scio, Ohio, merged with Mount Union, moving faculty to the Mount Union campus and abandoning the Scio campus. Mount Union College was renamed University of Mount Union effective August 1, 2010.

==Campus==
The University of Mount Union is located on a campus in Alliance, Ohio, from Cleveland, Ohio, and from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The university&#x27;s Huston-Brumbaugh Nature Center is approximately six miles away from the campus. Two buildings, Chapman Hall and Miller Hall, are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Kehres Stadium is the oldest college stadium in the state of Ohio.

==Academics==
Mount Union offers 46 majors and 47 minors as undergraduate programs. The university also offers Pre-Health/Pre-Medicine and Pre-Law programs. Mount Union offers 13 master&#x27;s degree programs, most of which are online. The university also has a Doctor of Physical Therapy program and an Emergency Nurse Practitioner certificate program.

Eighty-five percent of the faculty at Mount Union have earned a doctoral degree or other terminal degree with graduate training at universities in the United States and Europe.

===Rankings===
In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Mount Union tied for No. 24 out of 167 in Regional Universities Midwest, No. 9 in Regional Universities Midwest Best Value Schools, tied for No. 59 in Top Performers on Social Mobility in Regional Universities Midwest, tied for No. 223 in Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs at schools where a doctorate is not offered, and tied for No. 345 in Nursing.

===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, Mount Union accepted 75.7% of undergraduate applicants, with those admitted having an average 3.33 high school GPA. The university does not require submission of standardized test scores, Mount Union being a test optional school where scores will only be considered if scores increase the scholarship level for which the applicant is eligible although applicants who choose not to submit test scores are still eligible for academic scholarships. Those accepted that submitted test scores had an average 1070 SAT score (17% submitting scores) or average 22 ACT score (64% submitting scores). An application essay is required.

==Student life==
Mount Union&#x27;s radio station is 91.1 WRMU, and the campus paper is &quot;The Dynamo&quot;.

The university&#x27;s music program offers participation in numerous bands and choirs, including Concert Choir, Mount Union Alliance Chorale, Opera Workshop, Alliance Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Strings, Marching Band, The Raider Steel Band, Jazz Band, Percussion Ensemble, and more.

The Theatre Department puts on two productions every fall, and varying productions in the spring. Every spring semester alternates between a musical and a straight play every year for the main stage show, and every spring there are also student-directed one-acts. Theatre productions are open to all students, regardless of major or class rank.

In the spring of 2019, the University of Mount Union started its Esports program by fielding its first &quot;Overwatch&quot; roster. Later, the team began competing in &quot;Overwatch&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, and &quot;Rocket League&quot;.

There are four major social fraternities and four major social sororities with chapters at the institution.

Mount Union previously held the all divisions mark at 54 consecutive games until losing in the semifinals on December 12, 1999, to Rowan University (Glassboro, NJ). During both the 55 and 54 game streaks Mount Union won 3 consecutive National Championships. Since both streaks were connected—from 1997 to 2003 Mount Union won 109 of 110 games played. The Purple Raiders won 110 consecutive regular-season games between 1994 and 2005 (which was ended by conference foe Ohio Northern University on Oct 22, 2005), posted 14 undefeated regular seasons, won 16 Ohio Athletic Conference Championships, and had the best overall record in the 1990s (120–7–1, an overall winning percentage of 0.941).

<doc id="648543" wikidata="Q845712" url="?curid=648543" title="Logotherapy">
<text>Logotherapy is a form of existential therapy developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl. It is founded on the premise that the primary motivational force of individuals is to find meaning in life. Frankl describes it as &quot;the Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy&quot; along with Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis and Alfred Adler&#x27;s individual psychology.

Logotherapy is based on an existential analysis focusing on Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;will to meaning&quot; as opposed to Adler&#x27;s Nietzschean doctrine of &quot;will to power&quot; or Freud&#x27;s &quot;will to pleasure&quot;. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to this system is given in Frankl&#x27;s most famous book, &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; (1946), in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and reinforced his theories. Presently, there are a number of [[List of logotherapy institutes|

==Basic principles==
The notion of &quot;logotherapy&quot; was created with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word &quot;[[logos]]&quot; (&quot;meaning&quot;). Frankl&#x27;s concept is based on the premise that the primary motivational force of an individual is to find meaning in life. The following list of tenets represents basic principles of logotherapy:
* Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.
* Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.
* We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.

The human spirit is referred to in several of the assumptions of logotherapy, but the use of the term spirit is not &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;religious.&quot; In Frankl&#x27;s view, the spirit is the will of the human being. The emphasis, therefore, is on the search for meaning, which is not necessarily the search for [[God]] or any other supernatural being. Frankl also noted the barriers to humanity&#x27;s quest for meaning in life. He warns against &quot;...affluence, [[hedonism]], [and] [[materialism]]...&quot; in the search for meaning.

[[Telos|Purpose in life]] and [[Meaning of life|meaning in life]] constructs appeared in Frankl&#x27;s logotherapy writings with relation to [[existential vacuum]] and will to meaning, as well as others who have theorized about and defined [[Positive psychology|positive psychological]] functioning. Frankl observed that it may be psychologically damaging when a person&#x27;s search for meaning is blocked. Positive life purpose and meaning were associated with strong religious beliefs, membership in groups, dedication to a cause, life values, and clear goals. Adult development and [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] theories include the purpose in life concept. Maturity emphasizes a clear comprehension of life&#x27;s purpose, directedness, and intentionality which contributes to the feeling that life is meaningful.

Frankl&#x27;s ideas were operationalized by Crumbaugh and Maholick&#x27;s Purpose in Life (PIL) test, which measures an individual&#x27;s meaning and purpose in life. With the test, investigators found that meaning in life mediated the relationships between religiosity and well-being; uncontrollable stress and substance use; depression and self-derogation. Crumbaugh found that the Seeking of [[Nous|Noetic]] Goals Test (SONG) is a complementary measure of the PIL. While the PIL measures the presence of meaning, the SONG measures orientation towards meaning. A low score in the PIL but a high score in the SONG, would predict a better outcome in the application of Logotherapy.

===Discovering meaning===
According to Frankl, &quot;We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering&quot; and that &quot;everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one&#x27;s attitude in any given set of circumstances&quot;. On the meaning of suffering, Frankl gives the following example:

Frankl emphasized that realizing the value of suffering is meaningful only when the first two creative possibilities are not available (for example, in a concentration camp) and only when such suffering is inevitablehe was not proposing that people suffer unnecessarily.

==Philosophical basis of logotherapy==
Frankl described the meta-clinical implications of logotherapy in his book &quot;The Will to Meaning: Foundations and Applications of Logotherapy&quot;. He believed that there is no psychotherapy apart from the theory of the individual. As an existential psychologist, he inherently disagreed with the &quot;machine model&quot; or &quot;rat model&quot;, as it undermines the human quality of humans. As a neurologist and psychiatrist, Frankl developed a unique view of [[determinism]] to coexist with the three basic pillars of logotherapy (the freedom of will). Though Frankl admitted that a person can never be free from every condition, such as, biological, sociological, or psychological determinants; based on his experience during his life in the [[Nazi concentration camps]], he believed that a person is &quot;capable of resisting and braving even the worst conditions&quot;. In doing such, a person can detach from situations and themselves, choose an attitude about themselves, and determine their own determinants, thus shaping their own character and becoming responsible for themselves.

==Logotherapeutic views and treatment==

===Overcoming anxiety===
By recognizing the purpose of our circumstances, one can master [[anxiety]]. Anecdotes about this use of logotherapy are given by &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Tim Sanders, who explained how he uses its concept to relieve the stress of fellow airline travelers by asking them the purpose of their journey. When he does this, no matter how miserable they are, their whole demeanor changes, and they remain happy throughout the flight. Overall, Frankl believed that the anxious individual does not understand that their anxiety is the result of dealing with a sense of &quot;unfulfilled responsibility&quot; and ultimately a lack of meaning.

===Treatment of neurosis===
Frankl cites two neurotic pathogens: hyper-intention, a forced intention toward some end which makes that end unattainable; and hyper-reflection, an excessive attention to oneself which stifles attempts to avoid the [[neurosis]] to which one thinks oneself predisposed. Frankl identified [[anticipatory anxiety]], a fear of a given outcome which makes that outcome more likely. To relieve the anticipatory anxiety and treat the resulting neuroses, logotherapy offers [[paradoxical intention]], wherein the patient intends to do the opposite of their hyper-intended goal.

A person, then, who fears (i.e. experiences anticipatory anxiety over) not getting a good night&#x27;s sleep may try too hard (that is, hyper-intend) to fall asleep, and this would hinder their ability to do so. A logotherapist would recommend, then, that the person go to bed and intentionally try not to fall asleep. This would relieve the anticipatory anxiety which kept the person awake in the first place, thus allowing them to fall asleep in an acceptable amount of time.

===Depression===
Viktor Frankl believed depression occurred at the psychological, physiological, and spiritual levels. At the psychological level, he believed that feelings of inadequacy stem from undertaking tasks beyond our abilities. At the physiological level, he recognized a &quot;vital low&quot;, which he defined as a &quot;diminishment of physical energy&quot;. Finally, Frankl believed that at the spiritual level, the depressed individual faces tension between who they actually are in relation to what they should be. Frankl refers to this as the gaping abyss. Finally Frankl suggests that if goals seem unreachable, an individual loses a sense of future and thus meaning, resulting in depression. Thus logotherapy aims &quot;to change the patient&#x27;s attitude toward their disease as well as toward their life as a task&quot;.

In order to overcome depressed feelings and thoughts, Frankl challenges individuals who suffer from depression to find meaning in their suffering. Frankl frequently cites [[Nietzsche]]&#x27;s words, &quot;If we have our own why in life, we shall get along with almost any how&quot;. Suffering and all the [[negative emotion]]s that come with it are a normal part of the human experience and should even be expected. Edith Weisskopf-Joelson, a psychologist and follower of logotherapy, argues that &quot;our current mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy&quot;.

=== Obsessive–compulsive disorder ===
Frankl believed that those with obsessive–compulsive disorder lack the sense of completion that most other individuals possess. Instead of fighting the tendencies to repeat thoughts or actions, or focusing on changing the individual symptoms of the disease, the therapist should focus on &quot;transform[ing] the neurotic&#x27;s attitude toward their neurosis&quot;. Therefore, it is important to recognize that the patient is &quot;not responsible for his obsessional ideas&quot;, but that &quot;he is certainly responsible for his attitude toward these ideas&quot;. Frankl suggested that it is important for the patient to recognize their inclinations toward perfection as fate, and therefore, must learn to accept some degrees of uncertainty. Ultimately, following the premise of logotherapy, the patient must eventually ignore their obsessional thoughts and find meaning in their life despite such thoughts.

===Schizophrenia===
Though logotherapy was not intended to deal with severe disorders, Frankl believed that logotherapy could benefit even those with [[schizophrenia]]. He recognized the roots of schizophrenia in physiological dysfunction. In this dysfunction, the person with schizophrenia &quot;experiences himself as an object&quot; rather than as a subject. Frankl suggested that a person with schizophrenia could be helped by logotherapy by first being taught to ignore voices and to end persistent self-observation. Then, during this same period, the person with schizophrenia must be led toward meaningful activity, as &quot;even for the schizophrenic there remains that residue of freedom toward fate and toward the disease which man always possesses, no matter how ill he may be, in all situations and at every moment of life, to the very last&quot;.

===Terminally ill patients===
In 1977, Terry Zuehlke and John Watkins conducted a study analyzing the effectiveness of logotherapy in treating terminally ill patients. The study&#x27;s design used 20 male Veterans Administration volunteers who were randomly assigned to one of two possible treatments – (1) group that received eight 45-minute sessions over a 2-week period and (2) group used as control that received delayed treatment. Each group was tested on five scales – the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI K Scale]], MMPI L Scale, Death Anxiety Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Purpose of Life Test. The results showed an overall significant difference between the control and treatment groups. While the univariate analyses showed that there were significant group differences in 3/5 of the dependent measures. These results confirm the idea that terminally ill patients can benefit from logotherapy in coping with death.

===Forms of treatment===
&quot;Ecce Homo&quot; is a method used in logotherapy. It requires of the therapist to note the innate strengths that people have and how they have dealt with adversity and suffering in life; to ask the patient to consider how, despite everything a person may have gone through, they made the best of their suffering. The method is called &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;Behold the Man&quot;, because the method involves beholding how other people have made the best of their adversity.

==Critiques==
===Authoritarianism===
In 1961 [[Rollo May]] argued that logotherapy is, in essence, [[authoritarian]]. He suggested that Frankl&#x27;s therapy presents a plain solution to all of life&#x27;s problems, an assertion that would seem to undermine the complexity of human life itself. May contended that if a patient could not find their own meaning, Frankl would provide a goal for his patient. In effect, this would negate the patient&#x27;s personal responsibility, thus &quot;diminish[ing] the patient as a person&quot;. Frankl explicitly replied to May&#x27;s arguments through a written dialogue, sparked by Rabbi [[Reuven Bulka]]&#x27;s article &quot;Is Logotherapy Authoritarian?&quot;. Frankl responded that he combined the prescription of medication, if necessary, with logotherapy, to deal with the person&#x27;s psychological and emotional reaction to the illness, and highlighted areas of freedom and responsibility, where the person is free to search and to find meaning.

===Religiousness===
Critical views of the life and word of logotherapy&#x27;s founder and his work assume that Frankl&#x27;s religious background and experience of suffering guided his conception of meaning within the boundaries of the person and therefore that logotherapy is founded on Viktor Frankl&#x27;s worldview. Some researchers argue that logotherapy is not a &quot;scientific&quot; psychotherapeutic school in the traditional sense but a philosophy of life, a system of values, or a secular religion that is not fully coherent and based on questionable metaphysical premises.

Frankl openly spoke and wrote on religion and psychiatry, throughout his life, and specifically in his last book, &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Ultimate Meaning&quot; (1997). He asserted that every person has a spiritual unconscious, independently of religious views or beliefs, yet Frankl&#x27;s conception of the spiritual unconscious does not necessarily entail religiosity. In Frankl&#x27;s words: &quot;It is true, Logotherapy, deals with the Logos; it deals with Meaning. Specifically, I see Logotherapy in helping others to see meaning in life. But we cannot &quot;give&quot; meaning to the life of others. And if this is true of meaning per se, how much does it hold for Ultimate Meaning?&quot; The [[American Psychiatric Association]] awarded Viktor Frankl the 1985 [[Oskar Pfister Award]] (for important contributions to religion and psychiatry).

== Recent developments ==
Since the 1990s, the number of institutes providing education and training in logotherapy continues to increase worldwide.VFI / Institutes worldwide (E) Numerous logotherapeutic concepts have been integrated and applied in different fields, such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), and [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] prevention. The logotherapeutic concepts of [[noogenic neurosis]] and existential crisis were added to the ICD 11 under the name demoralisation crisis, i.e. a construct that features hopelessness, meaninglessness, and existential distress as first described by Frankl in the 1950s. Logotherapy has also been associated with psychosomatic and physiological health benefits. Besides Logotherapy, other meaning-centered psychotherapeutic approaches such as [[positive psychology]] and meaning therapy have emerged. [[Paul T. P. Wong|Paul Wong]]&#x27;s meaning therapy attempts to translate logotherapy into psychological mechanisms, integrating cognitive behavioral therapy, [[positive psychotherapy]] and the positive psychology research on meaning. Logotherapy is also being applied in the field of oncology and palliative care ([[William Breitbart]]). These recent developments introduce Viktor Frankl&#x27;s logotherapy to a new generation and extend its impact to new areas of research.

<doc id="648545" wikidata="Q16947752" url="?curid=648545" title="Manuport">
<text>A manuport is a natural object that has been deliberately taken from its original environment and relocated without further modification. Typically moved by human hand, some manuports are the result of other hominins. Common manuports include stones, seashells and fossils, which has led archaeologists and anthropologists to conclude they must have been chosen for their beauty. This recognition of an object’s aesthetic character suggests that certain manuports represent some of the earliest examples of art.

== Etymology ==
The earliest attestation of the word &quot;manuport&quot; is from English in 1966. The term is derived from the Latin words &quot;manus&quot; &#x27;hand&#x27; and &quot;portare&quot; &#x27;carry&#x27;.

== Notable manuports ==
=== Makapansgat cobble ===

The Makapansgat cobble was first discovered in the 1920s during excavations at an archaeological site in the Makapan Valley, South Africa. Although noted for its striking resemblance to a human face and its likely association with australopithecines, the cobble drew little attention at the time. (Only several years prior had the first description of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; been published and, as such, the cobble received no further study). As the field of evolutionary biology developed through the 20th century, aided by the discovery of further hominin species, it led to a renewed interest in the Makapansgat cobble.

Sedimentary analysis of the cave where the Makapansgat cobble was discovered, including the unearthing of a nearby &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; skeleton, dates the manuport to 2,000,000-3,000,000 BP. Jasperite, the principal mineral found in the cobble, is not found elsewhere in the cave, and the nearest deposit of jasperite is reportedly 32 km away. Robert G. Bednarik argues that the cobble must have, sometime around 2.95 million years ago, been picked up and “carried for a considerable distance” by an early hominin. The Makapansgat cobble is the oldest known manuport and is possibly the earliest example of symbolic thinking.

The Makapansgat cobble’s distinct ‘face’, with its pair of ‘eyes’ and a ‘mouth’, has led some researchers to conclude that the profile must have, at least partially, been carved by hand. However, current research suggests that the cobble’s ‘features’ are entirely the result of natural forces. During the Pliocene, the jasperite deposit that would become the Makapansgat cobble experienced serious geological stress that produced fractures, which were then later filled with silica. Typical forces of erosion then later wore the silica away, leaving the cobble’s ‘face’ mostly formed by the end of the Pliocene epoch.

=== Erfoud cuttlefish ===
The Erfoud manuport was discovered in 1984 by Lutz Fiedler during an archaeological excavation near the town of Erfoud, Morocco. The manuport was found alongside other stone tools estimated to have been deposited 200,000-300,000 BP during the Lower Palaeolithic. Measuring approximately 68mm long, 35mm wide and 33mm thick, the Erfoud manuport is noteworthy for resembling a “perfectly naturalistic and life-size, non-erect human penis”.

The manuport is composed from a fragment of a cuttlefish fossil (&quot;Orthoceras&quot; sp.) that was silicified during the Devonian or Carboniferous period. The fossil had to have been carried a substantial distance to its eventual site, as cuttlefish fossils are not found in this part of Eastern Morocco and they are known to be found commonly elsewhere. Microscopic analysis of the object’s surface has found no trace of human modification but does show signs of minor wear.

=== Barrow Island chert ===
In 2014, a chert manuport was discovered embedded in an ancient reef on Barrow Island, Western Australia. The island has no natural chert deposits and so the stone must have been carried from mainland Australia. Chert is a traditional toolstone and other chert artifacts found on Barrow Island have been modified to be used as a blade. The closest sources of chert are several kilometers away by boat in the Pilbara and Carnarvon Basin. The stone is believed to have been transported during the last Ice Age when the coastlines of Barrow Island and Australia would have been much closer and more easily traversable. The manuport notably displays no signs of fracture, despite being carried for the intended later use as a tool. This implies that the chert stone must have been lost at some point during transport.

The manuport was found lodged in calcrete, a kind of sedimentary rock typical of sand dunes and reefs that have dried out. The exposed portion of the chert measures 40mm wide by 35mm high. Chemical analysis has determined the calcrete’s age to be 41,000 years old, indicating the earliest possible date that the manuport was deposited. This supports other archeological discoveries on the island suggesting humans occupied Barrow Island as early as 53,000 years ago. Collectively these artifacts present one of the oldest examples of maritime resource exploitation outside of Africa.

Australian archeologists have noted that calcrete is an ideal medium for preservation and the finding of the Barrow Island manuport is a strong indication further artifacts are likely to be located along Western Australia’s limestone shelf.

=== Orange County galena ===
Sometime around 2006, a galena manuport was discovered in a cave in the San Joaquin Hills, California. Galena, or lead sulfide, has long been used as a mineral pigment by the local indigenous communities of what is now Southern California. The mineral has a naturally metallic sheen and can appear as lead-colored or dark silver when applied as paint. The cave the manuport was discovered in contains prehistoric rock art, for which galena was commonly used. The only nearby source of galena is between 26–32 km away and archeologists believe that the manuport was brought to the site through trade sometime during prehistory.

== Ambiguous manuports ==
It is not uncommon for ‘alien’ lithics to be found alongside other artifacts during archaeological excavations. Discerning whether certain stones are, indeed, manuports is difficult. There is no set criteria for determining a manuport and this designation is often provided at the researcher’s discretion.

=== Spirit Eye Cave pebbles ===
In a 2019 excavation in West Texas, archeologists uncovered 799 possible manuports from inside Spirit Eye Cave. Hundreds of unmodified, polished pebbles were uncovered, organized alongside other ‘cultural material’ that indicates human presence during prehistory. Sedimentary analysis indicates that these pebbles were deposited possibly 4,200 years BP. Researchers have suggested that this collection represents a portable form of ‘pebble art’, although their meaning is difficult to conclusively discern.

The pebbles demonstrate a striking uniformity. The leading theory proposed by archeologists is that these stones are gastroliths. Whether they were deposited after birds had died &quot;in situ&quot; or later collected by humans is still up for debate, though cultural significance of the stones should not be ruled out. Given the technological prominence of stones in prehistory, there is a myriad of possible ‘cultural meanings’ these gastroliths represent. One explanation offered is that these stones, given their smaller size, could have made for effective projectiles. Another explanation suggests that, like other contemporary prehistoric cultures, the Spirit Eye Cave manuports may have been spiritually ‘eaten’ (or placed in the mouth) as part of a lithophagic ritual.

=== Manuport size and hominids ===
Manuports can reveal to archeologists what some of the cultural practices of early hominids were. A collection of 176 manuports found in Olduvai, Tanzania are believed to have been deposited sometime around 1.8mya. Measuring the collection reveals two clear groups of manuports in a ‘deliberate selection and hoarding by a hominid species’. One group demonstrates an average weight of approximately 400g, and the other with an average weight of 220g. A manuport, like a footprint, may indicate the locomotion and mass of the hominid who threw it. It is possible that the collection of manuports found in Olduvai represent selection for sexual dimorphism: 400g is an ideal mass to be thrown by a male, and 220g is an ideal mass for a female. Alternatively, these two groups represent two separate group of hominids, the larger presumably being &quot;homo erectus&quot;.

<doc id="648553" wikidata="Q2964782" url="?curid=648553" title="Belmont, Harrow">
<text>Belmont is a residential area of the London Borough of Harrow, located between Stanmore, Kenton, Wealdstone and Queensbury.

==Etymology==
The area is named after the mound constructed in the early 18th century by Henry James Brydges, Earl of Carnarvon and first Duke of Chandos. He had a summer house built atop the mound for the wonderful view. The mound, or mount, is now the Stanmore Golf Course.

==Locale==
Belmont is a suburban residential district and was formerly served by Belmont station, on a railway single-line branch running from Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station to Stanmore Village railway station. The line was known locally as The Rattler, a term first coined by Pete Knobbler. The site of the station is now a car park. What may remain of the platform and track lies beneath tons of earth and rubble used to bring the car park up to street level. The Belmont Trail is a nature trail between Wealdstone and Stanmore running along much of the original track route. The circle was originally made for a tram line that would go across London. Its 4 exits were made due to this.

Belmont Circle provides the main focus of the area, being a large, circular parade of that intersects Kenton Lane. Many of the outlets are now food-related, with a few bars and a club completing the lineup. What was formerly the Belmont (and later The Spanish Arch) pub is now &#x27;The Cardamom Lounge&#x27;, a bar/restaurant serving authentic Indian food. Just off the Circle, Belmont Community Hall hosts local activities, events and a regular jumble sale.

==Demography==

In the 2011 census, the largest ethnic group in Belmont ward was Indian (34%), followed by White British (30%). Religion wise, 34% of residents adhered to Christianity, 30% to Hinduism, 11% to Islam, 8% to Judaism, 4% to Jainism, and 6% were not religious.

==Transport==
There are no train stations in Belmont today but both Harrow &amp; Wealdstone and Canons Park tube station are accessible nearby. Bus routes 186, H18 and H19 serve the area.

<text>Sectarian violence or sectarian strife is a form of communal violence which is inspired by sectarianism, that is, discrimination, hatred or prejudice between different sects of a particular mode of an ideology or different sects of a religion within a nation or community. Religious segregation often plays a role in sectarian violence.

== Concept ==
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute:
Sectarian violence differs from the concept of race riot. It may involve the dynamics of social polarization, the balkanization of a geographic area along the lines of self-identifying groups, and protracted social conflict.

Some of the possible enabling environments for sectarian violence include power struggles, political climate, social climate, cultural climate, and economic landscape.
*Economic conflict: capitalist versus socialist
*Political conflict: internationalist versus nationalist
*Interreligious conflict:
** Buddhist
** Christian
** Jewish
** Muslim
*Christian conflict: Catholic versus Protestant
*Islamic conflict: Shia versus Sunni

==Among Buddhists==
===In Japan===
In the Japanese Middle Ages, different Buddhist sects had warrior monks and private armies that frequently clashed. See Buddhism and violence.

==Among Christians==
===Catholic-Eastern Orthodox===

Although the First Crusade was initially launched in response to an appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos for help in repelling the invading Seljuq Turks from Anatolia, one of the lasting legacies of the Crusades was to &quot;further separate the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity from each other.&quot;

===European wars of religion===

Following the onset of the Protestant Reformation, a series of wars were waged in Europe starting 1524 and continuing intermittently until 1648. Although sometimes unconnected, all of these wars were strongly influenced by the religious change of the period, and the conflict and rivalry that it produced. According to Miroslav Volf, the European wars of religion were a major factor behind the &quot;emergence of secularizing modernity&quot;.

In the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre followers of the Roman Catholic Church killed up to 30,000 Huguenots (French Protestants) in mob violence. The massacres were carried out on the national day celebrating Bartholomew the Apostle. Pope Gregory XIII sent the leader of the massacres a Golden Rose, and said that the massacres &quot;gave him more pleasure than fifty Battles of Lepanto, and he commissioned Giorgio Vasari to paint frescoes of it in the Vatican&quot;. The killings have been called &quot;the worst of the century&#x27;s religious massacres&quot;, and led to the start of the &quot;fourth war&quot; of the French Wars of Religion.

===Northern Ireland===

Since the 16th century there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. This religious sectarianism is connected to a degree with nationalism. Northern Ireland has seen inter-communal conflict for more than four centuries and there are records of religious ministers or clerics, the agents for absentee landlords, aspiring politicians, and members of the landed gentry stirring up and capitalizing on sectarian hatred and violence as far back as the late 18th century.

William E.H. Lecky, an Irish historian, wrote in 1892 that, &quot;If the characteristic mark of a healthy Christianity be to unite its members by a bond of fraternity and love, then there is no country where Christianity has more completely failed than Ireland&quot;.

Steve Bruce, a sociologist, wrote;

John Hickey wrote;

The period from 1969 to 1998 is known as &quot;The Troubles&quot;, a period of frequent violence and tense relations between Northern Ireland&#x27;s communities. About one in eight females and one in five males in Northern Ireland identified themselves as belonging to no religion. However, people of no religion and are still generally attributed a Catholic or Protestant identity based on their ancestry and upbringing, both by the community in general and the state. Government advice recommends that in situations where an individual chooses not to identify as a member of the Catholic or Protestant community, individuals responsible for Equal Opportunities monitoring should determine communal affiliation on the basis of information such as name, address, schools attended or hobbies. People of no religion are less likely to support the main, constitution-oriented main political parties, or more likely to support a more neutral political party such as the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.

About two-thirds of people with no religion tend to think of themselves as neither unionist or nationalist, although a much higher percentage of those with no religion tend to think of themselves as unionist than nationalist.

For people who describe themselves as Protestant or Roman Catholic, a small majority of them appear to favour one of the two main political parties on either side: the Democratic Unionist Party or the Ulster Unionist Party for Protestants; and Sinn Féin or the Social Democratic and Labour Party for Roman Catholics. In each case, the percentage in the &quot;Northern Irish Life &amp; Times Survey&quot; in 2015 was 57%. Roman Catholics are more likely to reject the label British (59%) than Protestants are to reject the label Irish (48%).

Protestants are more likely to consider the British identity as the &#x27;best&#x27; single way to describe themselves, at 67%, with Roman Catholics close behind at 63% who consider the best single way to describe themselves as Irish. There is an equal level of support for the more neutral Northern Irish identity, with 25% of people from each religion likely to choose that label as the best description. Over a third of people with no religion prefer to be described as Northern Irish.

There are organizations dedicated to the reduction of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. The Corrymeela Community (in Ballycastle, County Antrim), operates a retreat centre on the northern coast of Northern Ireland to bring Catholics and Protestants together to discuss their differences and similarities. The Ulster Project works with teenagers from Northern Ireland and the United States to provide safe, non-denominational environments to discuss sectarianism in Northern Ireland. These organizations are attempting to bridge the gap of historical prejudice between the two religious communities.

Although state schools in Northern Ireland are non-denominational, most Catholic parents still send their children to specifically Catholic schools or Irish-language medium schools, thus ensuring that state school students are almost wholly Protestant. There are some integrated schools and the Society of Friends (Quakers) have long been an advocate of co-education in terms of religion, operating the Friends&#x27; School in Lisburn (first established in 1774).

===Yugoslav wars===

Howard Goeringer criticizes both the &quot;Catholic Pope and the Orthodox Patriarch&quot; for failing to condemn the &quot;deliberate massacre of men, women and children in the name of &#x27;ethnic cleansing&#x27; as incompatible with Jesus&#x27; life and teaching.&quot;

===Rwandan genocide===

The majority of Rwandans, and Tutsis in particular, are Catholic, so shared religion did not prevent genocide. Miroslav Volf cites a Roman Catholic bishop from Rwanda as saying, &quot;The best cathechists, those who filled our churches on Sundays, were the first to go with machetes in their hands&quot;. Ian Linden asserts that &quot;there is absolutely no doubt that significant numbers of prominent Christians were involved in sometimes slaughtering their own church leaders.&quot; According to Volf, &quot;what is particularly disturbing about the complicity of the church is that Rwanda is without doubt one of Africa’s most evangelized nations. Eight out of ten of its people claimed to be Christians.&quot;

When the Roman Catholic missionaries came to Rwanda in the late 1880s, they contributed to the &quot;Hamitic&quot; theory of race origins, which taught that the Tutsi were a superior race. The Church has been considered to have played a significant role in fomenting racial divisions between Hutu and Tutsi, in part because they found more willing converts among the majority Hutu. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) report on the genocide states,

In the colonial era, under German and then Belgian rule, Roman Catholic missionaries, inspired by the overtly racist theories of 19th century Europe, concocted a destructive ideology of ethnic cleavage and racial ranking that attributed superior qualities to the country&#x27;s Tutsi minority, since the missionaries ran the colonial-era schools, these pernicious values were systematically transmitted to several generations of Rwandans...

The Roman Catholic Church argues that those who took part in the genocide did so without the sanction of the Church. Although the genocide was ethnically motivated and religious factors were not prominent, Human Rights Watch reported that a number of religious authorities in Rwanda, particularly Roman Catholic, failed to condemn the genocide publicly at the time.

Some Christian leaders have been convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for their roles in the genocide. These include Rwandan Roman Catholic priests and nuns as well as a Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor.

===Scotland===

Scotland suffers from a spill-over of sectarianism, largely owing to the Troubles in neighbouring Northern Ireland as many people, particularly in the West of Scotland, have links to Northern Ireland by genealogy or immigration.

Scotland&#x27;s two largest and best supported football clubs—Glasgow Rangers, which, for many generations, has largely been identified with Protestants and unionism, and Glasgow Celtic, which, since its founding in the late 19th century, has been identified with Roman Catholics and Irish nationalism or republicanism—both subscribe, with varying degrees of success, to government initiatives and charities like the Nil by Mouth campaign are working in this area.

Celtic previously sent letters to every season ticket holder reminding supporters that no form of sectarianism is welcome at Celtic Park. Rangers&#x27; anti-sectarian policy is called &quot;Follow With Pride&quot;.

==Among Muslims==

Sectarian violence between the two major sects of Islam, Shia and Sunni, has occurred arising out of differences over the succession to Muhammad. Abu Bakr, a companion of Muhammad, was nominated by Umar and elected as the first Sunni Rightly Guided Caliph. However another group felt that Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, had been designated by Muhammad and is considered by Shia as the first Imam.

According to Sunnis, Abu Bakr was followed by Umar as caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, then by Uthman ibn Affan and finally by Ali. Ali&#x27;s right to rule was challenged by Muawiyah bin Abu Sufian, governor of Syria.

===In Iraq===

In February 2006, a full-scale civil war erupted in Iraq, when violence between the two Muslim rival sects erupted. It has left tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people dead and dozens of mosques and homes destroyed.

===In Pakistan===

In Pakistan sectarianism exhibited its first organized nature in early 1980 when two rival organizations were established: Tehrik-e-Jafaria (TFJ) (Organization of the Jafri (Shia) Law) represented Shia communities, and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) (Guardian of the Companions of the Prophet) representing Sunnis. The first major incident of this sectarian violence was killing of the Arif Hussain Hussaini, founding leader of TFJ in 1986.

In retaliation Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, founder of the (SSP) was murdered. Since then internecine bloody vendetta has ensued. The focus of this violence has been Kurram, Hangu, Dera Ismail Khan, Bahawalpur, Jhang, Quetta,Gigit- Baltistan and Karachi.

The transformation of the sectarian conflict to a violent civil war in Pakistan coincided with the establishment of the Islamic republic in Iran and promotion of the Sunni religion and its incorporation in the state institutions by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, regime in Pakistan.

The Iranian Revolution was led by Shia clerics, and it influenced Shia communities all over the world. In Pakistan Tehrik-e-Jafaria was established with the demands of enforcing the Sharia Law. This demand was viewed as detrimental by the Sunni religious leaders. In response SSP was established by the Sunni extremist clerics. Many of these clerics had a background in the sectarian strife against the Ahmadis (a heterodox sect considered non-Muslim by majority of the Muslims)

===In Somalia===
Ahlu Sunna Waljama&#x27;a is a Somali paramilitary group consisting of Sufis and moderates opposed to the radical Islamist group Al-Shabaab. They are fighting in order to prevent Wahhabism from being imposed on Somalia and to protect the country&#x27;s Sunni-Sufi traditions and generally moderate religious views.

===In Syria===

The Syrian civil war gradually shifted towards a more sectarian nature. Pro-Assad militant groups are largely Shia, while anti-Assad militant groups are Sunni.

===In Yemen===

In Yemen, there have been many clashes between Sunnis and Shia Houthis. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;In today’s Middle East, activated sectarianism affects the political cost of alliances, making them easier between co-religionists. That helps explain why Sunni-majority states are lining up against Iran, Iraq and Hezbollah over Yemen.&quot;

==Among Sikhs==
In 1978, Khalsa Sikhs consisting of Damdami Taksal, Akhand Kirtani Jatha and Akali-Nihangs led by Fauja Singh and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale clashed with members of the Sant Nirankari Mission, a heretical Sikh sect in Amritsar, Punjab after the Sant Nirankari Guru, Gurbachan Singh committed blasphemy by calling himself the reincarnation of Guru Nanak, made blasphemous statements on Guru Gobind Singh, Guru Granth Sahib, and created sacrilegious versions of Sikh rituals. The clashes ended with 3 Sant Nirankaris and 13 Khalsa Sikhs dead.

Piara Singh Bhaniara started his own heretical Sikh sect and &quot;dera&quot; with about 600,000 followers in the 1980s resulting in him being ex-communicated by the Akal Takht. In the summer of 2000, a local gurudwara disallowed one of Bhaniara&#x27;s followers from carrying the Sikh religious holy book Guru Granth Sahib. This prompted Bhaniara&#x27;s followers to write their own holy book (granth), resulting in the creation of the Bhavsagar Samudra Amrit Vani Granth. Orthodox Sikhs alleged that Bhavsagar Granth copied several portions from the Guru Granth Sahib, and that Bhaniara insultingly imitated the Sikh Guru Gobind Singh in several photos in the book. In September 2001, during a religious ceremony organized by Bhaniara&#x27;s followers, a newly-formed organization called Khalsa Action Force attacked the function, seized the Bhavsagar Granth and burned it. This was followed by several instances of Guru Granth Sahib being burnt in the rural gurudwaras of Punjab. The Punjab Police arrested and presented before media some young men, who stated that they had burned Guru Granth Sahib at the insistence of Bhaniara. The arrests sparked off violence against Bhaniara&#x27;s followers. In October 2001, Bhaniara was arrested under the National Security Act, and charged with several crimes. His followers were put in jail, where they were attacked with acid and knives by Sikhs. Some of Bhaniara&#x27;s &quot;dera&quot;s were converted into SGPC-administered gurudwaras. No action was taken against the Sikhs who attacked Bhaniara&#x27;s followers. In 2001, the Parkash Singh Badal-led Government of Punjab banned &quot;Bhavsagar Granth&quot; and confiscated all its copies, arresting those who were found in possession of these copies. The print copy was probably destroyed by the Punjab Police. In 2003, a Sikh man named Gopal Singh attempted to stab Bhaniara, when he was in Ambala to appear in the court in connection with his alleged involvement with the burning of the copies of Guru Granth Sahib. A member of Babbar Khalsa, Gurdeep Singh Rana was arrested for trying to assassinate Bhaniara using a bomb in January 2005.

<doc id="648563" wikidata="Q1187969" url="?curid=648563" title="START II">
<text>START II (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was a bilateral treaty between the United States and Russia on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. It was signed by US President George H. W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 3 January 1993, banning the use of multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Hence, it is often cited as the De-MIRV-ing Agreement.

It was ratified by the US Senate on 26 January 1996 with a vote of 87–4. Russia ratified START II on 14 April 2000, making it conditional on preserving the ABM Treaty. When the US withdrew from the ABM Treaty on 13 June 2002, Russia withdrew from START II one day later. Thus, START II never entered into effect.

Instead, SORT came into effect, which reduced the strategic warheads count per country to 1,700–2,200.

==Impact of MIRV==
ICBMs using MIRVs are considered destabilizing because they put a premium on a first strike. These missiles can carry from two warheads to as many as 50 in some Soviet super-heavy missile designs. They can also carry a large number of decoys. Significant numbers of highly accurate warheads and decoys could annihilate an entire nation in a first strike, including a substantial amount of an opponent&#x27;s missile silos and air force bomber fleet.

Hypothetically, if each side had 100 missiles, with five warheads each, and each side had a 95% chance of neutralizing its opponent&#x27;s missiles in their silos by firing two warheads at each silo, the side that strikes first can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about five by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads and keeping the remaining 60 missiles in reserve. Thus, the destruction capability is greatly multiplied by MIRVs since the number of enemy silos does not significantly increase.

Both Soviet R-36M and US LGM-118 Peacekeeper missiles could carry up to 10 MIRVs though the latter are no longer operational.

==Negotiations==
The historic agreement started on 17 June 1992 with the signing of a joint understanding by both presidents. The official signing of the treaty by the presidents took place on 3 January 1993. It was ratified by the US Senate on 26 January 1996 with a vote of 87–4. However, Russian ratification was stalled in the State Duma for many years. It was postponed many times to protest American military actions in Iraq and in Kosovo and to oppose the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe. The treaty became less relevant as the years passed, and both sides started to lose interest in it.

On 14 April 2000, the Russian Duma finally ratified the treaty with some conditions. Specifically, these conditions were that the US would continue to uphold the ABM Treaty, and that the US Senate would ratify a September 1997 addendum to START II that included agreed statements on the demarcation of strategic and tactical missile defenses. The US Senate never ratified the addendum, as a faction of Republicans led by Jesse Helms opposed any limits on American anti-ballistic missile systems. As a result, START II never entered into force.

==Replaced by SORT==
However, in 2001, US President George W. Bush set a plan in motion to reduce the country&#x27;s missile forces from 6,000 to between 1,700 and 2,200.

Thus, the START II treaty was officially bypassed by the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT), which was agreed to by Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin at their summit meeting in November 2001 and signed at Moscow Summit on 24 May 2002. Both sides agreed to reduce operationally-deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,700 from 2,200 by 2012.

On 13 June 2002, the US withdrew from the ABM Treaty, and the following day, Russia announced that it would no longer consider itself to be bound by START II provisions. Both countries continued to pursue their objectives. Russia still retains 54 MIRV-capable RS-20/R-36M (SS-18 Satan) with 10 warheads each, 40 MIRV-capable RS-18/UR-100N (SS-19 Stiletto) with 6 warheads each and 24 MIRV-capable RS-24 Yars with 3 warheads each. The US developed the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system to protect itself from small-scale ICBM attacks.

In October 2002, the US began its unilateral withdrawal of MIRV (including complete deactivation of Peacekeeper missiles) and completed it by 19 September 2005. The Minuteman III is, as of 2011, the only American land-based operational ICBM. It can potentially carry only three RVs.

<text>QNX4FS is an extent-based file system used by the QNX4 and QNX6 operating systems.

As the file system uses soft updates, it remains consistent even after a power failure, without using journaling. Instead, the writes are carefully ordered and flushed to disk at appropriate intervals so that the on-disk structure always remains consistent, no matter if the operation is interrupted. However, unflushed changes to the file system are nevertheless lost, as the disk cache is typically stored in volatile memory.

Another notable property of this file system is that its actual metadata, like inode information and disk bitmaps, are accessible in the same way as any other file on the file system (as /.inodes and /.bitmap, respectively). This is consistent with QNX&#x27;s (in fact, Plan 9 from Bell Labs&#x27;s, or historically Unix&#x27;s) philosophy that &quot;everything is a file&quot;.

<doc id="648567" wikidata="Q214287" url="?curid=648567" title="Hooded seal">
<text>The hooded seal or bladdernose seal (Cystophora cristata) is a large phocid found only in the central and western North Atlantic, ranging from Svalbard in the east to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the west. The seals are typically silver-grey or white in color, with black spots that vary in size covering most of the body. Hooded seal pups are known as &quot;blue-backs&quot; because their coats are blue-grey on the back with whitish bellies. This coat is shed after 14 months of age when the pups molt. It is the only species in the genus Cystophora.

==Naming==
The generic name &quot;Cystophora&quot; means &quot;bladder-bearer&quot; in Greek, from the species&#x27; unusual sexual ornament – a peculiar inflatable bladder septum on the head of the adult male. This bladder hangs between the eyes and down over the upper lip in the deflated state. In addition, the hooded seal can inflate a large balloon-like sac from one of its nostrils. This is done by shutting one nostril valve and inflating a membrane, which then protrudes from the other nostril.

==Size==

Adult males are long on average, can grow to 3.5 m, and weigh . Sexual dimorphism is obvious from birth and females are much smaller: long and weighing . The color is silvery; the body is scattered with dark, irregular marks. The head is darker than the rest of the body, and without marks.

==Distribution and habitat==
Hooded seals live primarily on drifting pack ice and in deep water in the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic. Although some drift away to warmer regions during the year, their best survival rate is in colder climates. They can be found on four distinct areas with pack ice: near Jan Mayen Island (northeast of Iceland); off Labrador and northeastern Newfoundland; the Gulf of St. Lawrence; and the Davis Strait (off midwestern Greenland). Males appear to be localized around areas of complex seabed, such as Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, and the Flemish cap, while females concentrate their habitat efforts primarily on shelf areas, such as the Labrador Shelf. Hooded seals are known to be a highly migratory species that often wander long distances, as far west as Alaska and as far south as the Canary Islands and Guadeloupe. Prior to the mid 1990s, hooded seal sightings in Maine and the east Atlantic were rare, but began increasing in the mid 1990s. From January 1997 to December 1999, a total of 84 recorded sightings of hooded seals occurred in the Gulf of Maine, one in France and one in Portugal. From 1996 to 2006, five strandings and sightings were noted near the Spanish coasts in the Mediterranean Sea. There is no scientific explanation for the increase in sightings and range of the hooded seal.

==Diet==
The diet of the hooded seal is composed primarily of various amphipods (crustaceans), euphausiids (krill), and fish, including Atlantic argentine, capelin, Greenland halibut, cod, herring, and redfish. They also are known to eat squid, sea stars, and mussels. Relative to the other species, hooded seals consume 3 times the proportion of redfish; percentages of capelin were similar in relation to closely related species. Capelin is considered a more common choice of sustenance during the winter season. Their diet is considered to be rich in lipids and fatty acids.

==Behavior==
Hooded seals tend to feed in relatively deep waters ranging from , and dive from 5 to 25 minute durations. However, some dives can go deeper than and as long, or longer, than 52 minutes. Diving is rather continuous, with approximately 90% of their time spent submerged during the day and night, although dives during the day are generally deeper and longer. Dives during the winter are also deeper and longer than those in the summer. It is known that the hooded seal is generally a solitary species, except during breeding and molting seasons. During these two periods, they tend to fast as well. The seals mass annually near the Denmark strait around July, at the time of their molting periods, to mate. Hooded seals are a relatively unsocial species compared to other seals, and they are typically more aggressive and territorial. They demonstrate aggression by inflating the &quot;hood&quot; (which is explained in the &quot;Nasal Cavity&quot; section below). They frequently migrate and remain alone for most of the year, except during mating season.

==Nasal cavity==
The hooded seal is known for its uniquely elastic nasal cavity located at the top of its head, also known as the hood. Only males possess this nasal sac, which they begin to develop around the age of four. The hood begins to inflate as the seal makes its initial breath prior to going underwater. It then begins to repetitively deflate and inflate as the seal is swimming. The purpose of this happening is for acoustic signaling, meaning that it occurs when the seal feels threatened and attempts to ward off hostile species when competing for resources such as food and shelter. It also serves to communicate their health and superior status to both other males and females they are attempting to attract. In sexually mature males, a pinkish balloon-like nasal membrane comes out of the left nostril to further aid it in attracting a mate. This membrane, when shaken, is able to produce various sounds and calls depending on whether the seal is underwater or on land. Most of these acoustic signals are used in acoustic situation (about 79%), while about 12% of the signals are used for sexual purposes.

==Breeding and life cycle==
There are four major breeding areas for the hooded seal: the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the &quot;Front&quot; east of Newfoundland; Davis Strait (between Greenland and northern Canada); and the West Ice near Jan Mayen. Male hooded seals are known to have several mates in a single mating season, following the hypothesis that they are polygynous. While some males will defend and mate with just one female for long periods of time, others will be more mobile and tend to mate with multiple females for shorter periods of time, generating maximum offspring within the population. Most males reach sexual maturity by 5 years of age.

Throughout all areas, the hooded seals whelp in late March and early April and molt from June to August. The four recognized herds are generally sorted into two distinct populations: a Northeast (NE) Atlantic population and a Northwest (NW) Atlantic population. It is estimated that 90% of the total NW population give birth on the &quot;Front&quot;. The NE herd whelping (giving birth) around Jan Mayen generally disperse into the sea after they breed in March. From April through June, after the breeding season, this species travels long distances to feed and then eventually gather together once again. Although some individuals return to the same area of ice in July to undergo moulting, the majority of the herd molt further North. After molting, the species disperses widely again to feed in the late summer and autumn before returning to the breeding areas again in late winter.

==Offspring==

Pups are about long at birth and weigh about . They are born on the ice from mid-March to early April with a well-developed blubber layer and having shed their pre-natal coat. They are born with a slate blue-grey coat (giving them the name &quot;blueback&quot;), with a pale cream color on the belly, which they will molt after about 14 months. Nursing of the pup lasts for an average of only 4 days, the shortest lactation period of any mammal, during which the pup doubles in size, gaining around /day. This is possible because the milk that they drink has a fat content of 60%. The female pup will mature between ages 3 and 6, whereas the male pup will mature between ages 5 and 7.

==Early development==
Researchers find that due to a pup&#x27;s differing needs in regards to sustaining work and foraging while under water compared to adults, the skeletal and cardiac muscles develop differently. Studies show that cardiac blood flow provides sufficient oxygen to sustain lipolytic pathways during dives, remedying their hypoxic challenge. Cardiac tissue is more developed than skeletal muscles at birth and during the weaning period, although neither tissue is fully developed by the end of the weaning period. Pups are born with fully developed hemoglobin stores (found in blood), but their myoglobin levels (found in skeletal tissue) are only 25–30% of adult levels. These observations demonstrate that pup muscles are less able to sustain either aerobic or anaerobic ATP production during dives than adults. This is due to the large stores of oxygen, either bound to hemoglobin or myoglobin, which the seals rely on to dive for extended periods of time. This could be a potential explanation for pups’ short weaning period as diving is essential to their living and survival.

Hooded seals shed their lanugo fur in the womb and are born with a thin non lanugo fur coat, which is a less efficient thermoregulating fur coat compared to some to other seal species (e.g., leopard seals). Studies have shown that newborn hooded seals undergo a stage after birth where the thickness of their blubber grows rapidly, which maximizes their ability to thermoregulate and compensate for their thin fur coat. This process of fur removal in the womb and alternatively using blubber may be advantageous because water cannot penetrate blubber like it does with fur, therefore blubber can insulate the seals in both water and air fairly uniformly.

==Lifespan==
The hooded seal can live to about age 30 to 35.

==Threats and conservation practices==
Prior to the 1940s, adult hooded seals were primarily hunted for their leather and oil deposits. More recently, the main threats are hunting, including subsistence hunting, and bycatch. Seal strandings are not considered a large threat to hooded seal populations but are highly researched. Seal pups are hunted for their blue and black pelts and many mothers are killed in the process, attempting to protect their young. Hunting primarily occurs in areas of Greenland, Canada, Russia, and Norway. Overall, northwest Atlantic hooded seal populations are stable or increasing whereas the northeast Atlantic populations have declined by 85–90% within the last 60 years.

It was believed by the scientific community that sonar was leading to mass stranding of hooded seals. After multiple sonar tests on captive seals, ranging from 1 to 7 kHz, it became evident that it had little effect on the subjects. The first test on each subject yielded differing results, ranging from reduced diving activity and rapid exploratory swimming. A difference was only noted for all subjects on their initial exposure.

Conservation practices, brought about by international cooperation and the formation of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) led to hooded seal population increases. It is now required to hold a license to hunt hooded seals in international waters and each license is set a quota. Total allowable catch of hooded seals are set at 10,000 annually.

The hooded seal is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.

<text>Burgdorf (; High Alemannic: &quot;Bùùrdlef&quot;) is the largest city in the Emmental in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It was the capital of the district of the same name until 2010, when it became part of the new Emmental district.

== Name ==
Burgdorf it is called in the German language, Berthoud in French which is not a literal translation of Burgdorf. Berthoud is in memory of Berchthold V. Duke of Zähringen who added a plaque to the city entrance for his victory against the Burgundese. As a Latinized form of Burgdorf, Castrovilla is known, but a Villa Berchtoldi or similar has not been found to date.

==History==

Scattered archeological finds indicate that the area around Burgdorf was inhabited during the Neolithic era, the Late Bronze Age and the Hallstatt.

During the High Middle Ages the land that would become Burgdorf was owned by the Kingdom of Burgundy and then after 1080 by the Dukes of Zähringen. Either the kings or the dukes built a castle on the left bank of the Emme river. Burgdorf is first mentioned in 1236 as &quot;in oppido Burchtorff&quot;, while Burgdorf Castle is mentioned in 1080 as &quot;castellum Bertoldi ducis&quot;. The Zähringen dukes built a city (upper-west city section) around the castle in the last quarter of the 12th century. After the extinction of the Zähringen line, Burgdorf passed to the Counts of Kyburg. They expanded the city in 1278 with the upper-east section and between 1278 and 1300 absorbed the Holzbrunnen settlement which became the lower town. By 1300 the city had expanded to fill the town walls. Starting in 1323 there was a ban on construction within the walls, which marked the border of the city until 1800. Under the Kyburg or Neu-Kyburg Counts, Burgdorf Castle was the capital of the county, and the Counts were the mayors of Burgdorf town. 
In the 14th century, the Neu-Kyburgs became increasingly indebted. On 11 November 1382, Count Rudolf II of Neu-Kyburg, launched a raid against the city of Solothurn to try and force the city to forgive his debts. For the city of Bern, this attack on an allied city represented an excellent opportunity for the city to break its ties with the Neu-Kyburgs. In March 1383 the Bernese-Solothurn army marched on Burgdorf. This army was supported with troops from the Forest Cantons, Lucerne, Zürich, Neuchâtel and Savoy and were armed with catapults and primitive guns. Because Count Rudolf II had died before the war began, Burgdorf was defended by Rudolf&#x27;s uncle, Berchtold I. Under Berchtold, Burgdorf withstood a 45-day siege. An attempt to negotiate a cease-fire on 21 April 1383, between Bern and the citizens of Burgdorf against the Neu-Kyburgs was also unsuccessful. Beset by the enormous burdens of war and civil unrest at home, the Bernese Council sought Confederation mediation to end the war. On 5 April 1384, the Neu-Kyburgs agreed to sell the towns and castles of Burgdorf and Thun to Bern for 37,800 guilders.

As part of the peace treaty, Bern acknowledged the rights and privileges that the Kyburgs had granted to Burgdorf. Burgdorf enjoyed a unique amount of autonomy compared to the other cities in the Bernese city-state. The town had its own mayor, council and high and low courts. Starting in 1394 the town began to buy courts, land and forests from the impoverished nobility. It began to acquire the surrounding villages and towns as well. In 1394 Rütschelen came under Burgdorf&#x27;s authority. This was followed in 1395 by Grasswil, 1400 by Wil (now part of Rütschelen), 1402 by Inkwil (until 1720), 1423 by Niederösch, 1429 by Bettenhausen, 1429 and 1509/10 Thörigen, 1431 by Gutenburg and Lotzwil, 1435 by Kleindietwil and at the start of the 16th century Oberösch. The city created the bailiwicks of Grasswil (Grasswil, Ösch, Heimiswil) and Lotzwil (Thörigen, Lotzwil) under the administration of an alderman.

The city government consisted of a small council (12 members) and a large council (32 members) Starting in 1384 the &quot;Schultheiss&quot; was chosen by Bern. The small council was proposed by Burgdorf and approved by Bern, while the large council was appointed by the small council. By the 15th century, Burgdorf had about 900 residents which made it larger than most of the surrounding towns. The main industry remained agriculture until about 1798. Trade remained mostly regional and the products of the local industry (tannery, wool and linen weaving) only sold in the nearby region. Until the late 15th century, the town had a few guilds which remained without political or social power. They were mostly responsible for a few city obligations including supervising the fire and security watches. There were five guild houses in the upper city (blacksmiths-carpenters, butchers-shoemakers, bakers, weavers and tailors), one in the lower town (tanners). Each guild consisted of several trades, for example the blacksmiths-carpenters, allowed craftsmen working in 22 different jobs involving iron, stone and wood processing to join.

The economic growth in the 15th century enabled the city to build municipal buildings and maintain the fortifications and public areas. The city hall, church and market were all built or expanded during this time. However, starting in the 1460s and 1470s the economy began to stagnate. The guilds gradually became more powerful and began to choke the economy. In the 16th century, the economies of the surrounding villages began to grow unfettered by guild rules. The guild controlled markets of Burgdorf attempted to compete with these small markets by banning the import of goods from the surrounding countryside. These bans (in 1619 and again in 1666–74) only served to undermined Burgdorf&#x27;s position as a regional market and service center. Burgdorf remained hostile to new businesses and in some cases drove them to settle in neighboring towns.

With the construction of the road on Kirchberg (1756–64) Burgdorf was no longer on any regional trade routes. The devastating fires (1706 upper town and in 1715 in the lower town) forced the city council to rebuild much of the city. Overall, the population stagnated and after 1655 it became increasingly hard to gain citizenship in Burgdorf. The percentage of non-citizen residents who could become citizens was less than 40% in 1764. As the number of artisans had declined, there were fewer and fewer families for that could serve on the town councils. At times, the large council only had 27 members instead of 32, due to a lack of candidates. During the Swiss peasant war of 1653 the city remained loyal to Bern. While they feared an attack by the peasant armies, Burgdorf was bypassed. The invasion of the French in 1798 and the forced reforms of the Helvetic Republic demolished much of the traditional, conservative power structure and privilege in Burgdorf.

<doc id="648570" wikidata="Q1128268" url="?curid=648570" title="Constitutional Union Party (United States)">
<text>The Constitutional Union Party was a political party which stood in the 1860 United States elections. It mostly consisted of conservative former Whigs from the Southern United States who wanted to avoid secession over slavery and refused to join either the Republican Party or Democratic Party. The Constitutional Union Party campaigned on a simple platform &quot;to recognize no political principle other than the Constitution of the country, the Union of the states, and the Enforcement of the Laws&quot;.

The Whig Party collapsed in the 1850s due to a series of crises over slavery. Many former Whigs joined the new, anti-slavery Republican Party, but others joined the nativist American Party. The American Party declined after the 1856 elections, and for the 1860 elections John J. Crittenden and other former Whigs formed the Constitutional Union Party. The 1860 Constitutional Union Convention nominated John Bell of Tennessee for president and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for vice president. Party leaders hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives by denying any one candidate a majority in the Electoral College.

The 1860 election essentially consisted of two campaigns, as Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln competed with Northern Democratic candidate Stephen A. Douglas in the North, and Bell competed with Southern Democratic candidate John C. Breckinridge in the South. Ultimately, Lincoln won the election by winning nearly every Northern electoral vote. Bell took 12.6% of the nationwide popular vote, carried Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia, and finished with the second highest vote total in each remaining slave state that held a popular vote. After the election, Crittenden and other Constitutional Unionists unsuccessfully sought to prevent a civil war with the Crittenden Compromise and the Peace Conference of 1861. Bell declared his support for the Confederacy following the Battle of Fort Sumter, but many other Constitutional Unionists remained loyal to the Union throughout the American Civil War.

== Background ==

The Constitutional Union Party had its roots in the Whig Party and the sectional crises of the 1850s. The Compromise of 1850 shook up partisan alignments in the South, with elections in the Lower South being contested by Unionists and extremist &quot;Fire-Eaters&quot; rather than Whigs and Democrats. The victory of pro-compromise Southern politicians in these elections, along with President Millard Fillmore&#x27;s attempts at diligently enforcing the Fugitive Slave Clause, temporarily quieted Southern calls for secession. The debate over the Kansas–Nebraska Act again polarized legislators sectional lines, with Southern Whigs providing critical votes in the House as a narrow majority of Northern Democrats voted against it.

A new, anti-slavery party known as the Republican Party was formed in May 1854. Republican leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, generally did not call for the abolition of slavery, but instead called for Congress to prevent the extension of slavery into the territories. By 1855, Republicans had replaced the Whigs as the main opposition to the Democrats in most Northern states. The nativist American Party displaced the Whigs in the remaining states; though some Democrats joined the American Party, in many Southern states the American Party consisted almost entirely of former Whigs.

The 1856 American National Convention nominated former President Fillmore for president in the 1856 presidential election; Fillmore also received the presidential nomination at the sparsely attended 1856 Whig National Convention. Many supporters of the American Party continued to identify primarily as Whigs, and Fillmore minimized the issue of nativism, instead attempting to use his campaign as a platform for unionism and a revival of the Whig Party. He finished in second in several states in the South and carried just a single state in the 1856 election, confirming that the Republican Party, rather than the American Party, would replace the Whigs as the main opposition to the Democrats. The American Party collapsed after the 1856 elections, and many Southern officeholders who refused to join the Democratic Party organized themselves into the Opposition Party.

== Formation ==
Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, Henry Clay&#x27;s successor in border-state Whiggery, led a group of conservative, unionist congressmen in forming the Constitutional Union Party. At Crittenden&#x27;s behest, fifty former and current members of Congress met in Washington, D.C. in December 1859, where they agreed to form a new party dedicated to preserving the union and avoiding debates over slavery. The new party received the blessing of the respective national committees of the Whig Party and the American Party, and was officially formed on February 12, 1860.

Among the members of the new party&#x27;s executive committee were Crittenden, former Democratic Senator William Cabell Rives of Virginia, 1852 Whig vice presidential nominee William Alexander Graham of North Carolina, former Congressman John P. Kennedy of Maryland, and newspaper editor William Gannaway Brownlow of Tennessee. In the North, the party drew support from conservative former Whigs such as Edward Everett and Robert Charles Winthrop. Many of these Northerners, including Everett, were followers of Daniel Webster, a Whig senator from Massachusetts who had died in 1852.

Party leaders did not expect to win the election outright, but instead sought to win states in the Upper South and the Lower North. They were particularly focused on Maryland, the lone state won by Fillmore in 1856, as well as Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Constitutional Unionists hoped to deny an electoral vote majority to any one candidate, thereby forcing a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Party leaders hoped that, in such a contingent election, the House would reject the other eligible candidates as too extreme and instead elect the Constitutional Union nominee.

== 1860 national convention ==


The Constitutional Union national convention convened in Baltimore on May 9, 1860. Delegates came from 23 of the 33 states, though the vast majority of delegates came from the Upper South. As a large proportion of the delegates were over the age of sixty, some political opponents derided the Constitutional Unionists as the &quot;Old Gentleman&#x27;s Party&quot;. The party adopted a simple platform, stating that they would &quot;recognize no political principle other than the Constitution...the Union...and the Enforcement of the Laws.&quot; The party also established the National Central Executive Union Committee to wage the party&#x27;s election campaign; Congressman Alexander Boteler of Virginia was selected to head the committee.

Though the septuagenarian Crittenden was the acknowledged party leader, he declined to seek the presidential nomination due to his age. The two major contenders for the presidential nomination were former Senator John Bell of Tennessee and Governor Sam Houston of Texas. During his long career in the Whig Party, Bell had established a reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, opposing both the Mexican–American War and the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Houston had served in two wars and had compiled a long political record as a leading member of the Democratic Party, and like Bell he had opposed the Kansas–Nebraska Act. However, his status as a former protege of Andrew Jackson alienated many of the delegates, and Bell&#x27;s backers argued that Houston would have little appeal in the North. Aside from Bell and Houston, other potential candidates for the Constitutional Union presidential nomination included Everett, 1852 Whig nominee Winfield Scott, and Edward Bates of Missouri, who ultimately chose to support the Republican Party.

On the first presidential ballot, Bell won 68 1/2 votes compared to Houston&#x27;s 57, with the remainder of the delegates voting for Crittenden, Everett, and various favorite son candidates. Bell picked up support from dozens of delegates on the second ballot, thereby clinching the nomination. Houston refused to endorse Bell and ultimately declined to back any candidate in the 1860 election. Seeking to provide sectional balance to the ticket, the convention selected Everett as the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee by acclamation. Everett reluctantly accepted the vice presidential nomination, as he felt that he had had a more accomplished career than Bell. With the nomination of two former Whigs, many regarded the Constitutional Union Party as a continuation of the Whig Party; one Southern newspaper called the new party the &quot;ghost of the old Whig Party.&quot;

== 1860 presidential election ==

A split in the Democratic Party led to the nomination of two separate Democratic presidential candidates; Senator Stephen A. Douglas had the support of most Northern Democrats, while Vice President John C. Breckinridge garnered the backing of most Southern Democrats. Meanwhile, seeking to rally support in the Deep South, a group of Constitutional Unionists meeting in Alabama issued a platform holding that Congress and territorial legislatures could not prevent individuals from bringing slaves into the territories. This platform, though not adopted by the national party, badly damaged the standing of Constitutional Unionists in the North. Bell&#x27;s ownership of slaves further alienated Northerners, and his and Everett&#x27;s status as former Whigs limited the party&#x27;s ability to compete for the support of Northern Democrats. Thus, the 1860 presidential election essentially consisted of two separate campaigns. In the North, Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln faced Douglas, and in the South, the Constitutional Union ticket competed against Breckinridge.

Adhering to precedent, Bell remained at his home during the campaign, but Breckinridge and other party leaders gave numerous speeches. The party campaigned on the slogan, &quot;the Union as it is, the Constitution as it is.&quot; The party&#x27;s official lack of a stance on slavery positioned it between the Lincoln&#x27;s Republican Party, who campaigned on a platform against extending slavery to any new states or territories, and Breckinridge&#x27;s Southern Democrats, who favored allowing slavery in all territories. Historian Frank A. Towers writes that, &quot;notwithstanding the nuances of local issues in selecting a president, voters could either endorse the compromise vision of the Union by choosing Douglas or Bell, or reject it by opting for Lincoln or Breckinridge.&quot; Southern Democrats attacked the Constitutional Union platform, arguing that the issue of slavery could not be ignored in the campaign. Constitutional Unionists responded by attacking Breckinridge (who publicly disavowed disunion) as a secessionist who had fallen under the influence of Fire-Eaters like William Lowndes Yancey. The party also attacked Lincoln as an inexperienced, sectional candidate whose election threatened to provoke the secession of the South.

Recognizing Lincoln&#x27;s likelihood of winning the election, some opponents of the Republican Party discussed the possibility of Bell, Breckinridge, and Douglas dropping out in favor of a new candidate, but Douglas and possibly Bell objected to this scheme. In August, August Belmont, the chairman of Douglas&#x27;s campaign, proposed an &quot;entente cordiale&quot; with the intent of denying Lincoln an electoral vote majority. After much negotiation, Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge agreed to form a single fusion ticket in the state of New York. In the event of a fusion victory in the state, Douglas would receive eighteen electoral votes, Bell would receive ten electoral votes, and Breckinridge would receive seven electoral votes. Similar fusion tickets were established in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.

Nationwide, Lincoln took 39.8% of the popular vote, while Douglas won 29.5% of the popular vote, Breckenridge won 18.1%, and Bell won 12.6%. Lincoln carried all but one Northern state, winning a majority of the electoral vote with 180 votes to 72 for Breckinridge, 39 for Bell, and 12 for Douglas. Lincoln won every county in New England and most of the remaining counties in the North, but he won just two of the 996 Southern counties. Lincoln won New York by a margin of 7.4 points; had he lost the state to the Fusion ticket, he would not have won a majority of the electoral vote and a contingent election would have been held in the House of Representatives. The vast majority of Bell&#x27;s support came from Southern voters, though he did win three percent of the vote in the North. Bell won a plurality of the vote in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia, and finished within five points of Breckinridge or Douglas in North Carolina, Maryland, Missouri, and Louisiana. Bell finished a distant second to Breckinridge in all of the remaining slave states except South Carolina, which did not hold a popular vote for president.

In addition to winning the presidency, the Republican Party made moderate gains in both the U.S. Senate and House in the 1860 elections, though Republicans failed to win a majority of seats in either. However, after southern Democrats withdrew to join the Confederacy, the party gained control of both chambers prior to the start of the 37th Congress. Democrats would have the second-largest number of members in both chambers, although many members identified as Unionists rather than Democrats or Republicans.

== Secession ==
Following Lincoln&#x27;s victory, several states in the Deep South seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, but the Upper South initially remained in the Union. Although some supporters of Breckinridge opposed secession and some supporters of Bell supported it, the secession movement was generally led by those who had voted for Breckindrige in the 1860 election, and efforts to avert secession in the South were generally led by those had voted for Bell. The Senate created the Committee of Thirteen, consisting of prominent senators such as Crittenden, Douglas, Democrat Robert Toombs of Georgia, and Republican Benjamin Wade of Ohio. Working closely with Douglas, Crittenden assumed leadership of the Committee of Thirteen even though he was not officially selected as the committee&#x27;s leader.

Crittenden proposed a package of six constitutional amendments, known as the Crittenden Compromise, that would forbid Congress from abolishing slavery in any state, protect slavery in federal territories south of the 36°30′ parallel, and prohibit it in territories north of that latitude. Crittenden&#x27;s compromise proved unacceptable to both Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats, and it failed to win approval from the Committee of Thirteen. In another attempt to avert secession, leading politicians in the Lower North and Upper South organized the Peace Conference of 1861. The convention proposed a package of seven constitutional amendments that were largely similar to the Crittenden Compromise. On the last day of the 36th United States Congress, both the Crittenden Compromise and the separate plan proposed at the Peace Convention were rejected in the House and the Senate.

The Civil War began with the Confederate attack of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. After Lincoln called up volunteers in response to the Battle of Fort Sumter, Bell declared his support for the Confederacy. Bell&#x27;s decision helped convince many other Constitutional Unionists and Southern moderates to support the Confederacy during the Civil War. Other party leaders, including Crittenden and Everett, remained loyal to the Union.

==Aftermath==
Constitutional Unionists were influential in the Wheeling Convention, which led to the creation of the Union loyalist state of West Virginia, as well as in the declaration of the Kentucky General Assembly for the Union and winning Congressional elections in Kentucky and Maryland in June. Many border state Constitutional Unionists, including John Marshall Harlan, joined Union parties that sprung up during the war. In Missouri, many of the party supported the Unconditional Union ticket organized by Francis P. Blair Jr. and remained active in that state&#x27;s efforts to remain in the Union by overthrowing the elected government of Claiborne Jackson. Everett supported the Union and in 1863 gave a speech at Gettysburg before Lincoln&#x27;s famous Gettysburg Address.

During Reconstruction, former Whigs and Constitutional Unionists constituted a majority of the scalawags (white members of the Republican Party) in almost every state in the South, joining the Republican Party at a higher rate than pre-war Democrats. Some of these scalawags continued to identify primarily as Whigs as late as the 1890s.

<text>Paul Blackburn (November 24, 1926 – September 13, 1971) was an American poet. He influenced contemporary literature through his poetry, translations and the encouragement and support he offered to fellow poets.

==Biography==
Blackburn was born in St. Albans, Vermont. His parents, William Gordon Blackburn and Frances Frost (also a poet, novelist and author of children&#x27;s books), separated when Blackburn was three and a half. Thereafter, he was cared for primarily by his maternal grandparents on their farm in St. Albans until he was fourteen, when his mother took him to New York City to live with her in Greenwich Village. He began writing poetry in his late teens under her encouragement.

Shortly after enrolling in New York University in 1945, Blackburn joined the army hoping to be sent overseas. The war ended soon after however, and he spent the rest of his service as a laboratory technician in Colorado. In 1947 he returned to NYU, transferring in 1949 to the University of Wisconsin, and graduating in 1950.

It was during these college years that Blackburn first became influenced by Ezra Pound, and began corresponding with him while at the University of Wisconsin. He hitchhiked to Washington, D.C. several times to visit him at St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital. Through Pound, he came into contact with Robert Creeley, which led to links with Cid Corman, Denise Levertov, Charles Olson, Joel Oppenheimer and Jonathan Williams. Through Creeley came an ancillary involvement with the first two issues of Creeley&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Black Mountain Review,&quot; which resulted in the occasional inclusion of Blackburn in the Black Mountain school of poets. The introduction to the &quot;Collected Poems&quot; states, &quot;Blackburn always opposed the division of poets into schools and did not like the role of Black Mountain poet into which he was cast by Donald Allen&#x27;s anthology &quot;The New American Poetry&quot; (1960). He embraced all types of poetry, citing the value of &#x27;all work, if you work &#x27;em right.&#x27;&quot; (E. Jarolim in &quot;The Collected Poems Of Paul Blackburn&quot;, 1985).

It was also Pound who pointed Blackburn in the direction of Provençal poetry, and he studied the languages of Provence while at the University of Wisconsin. His work on Provençal translations intensified following the 1953 publication of a slim selection of the poems from Divers Press, and the awarding the following year of a Fulbright Fellowship to study Provençal language and literature in France. He continued translating Provençal poetry for the rest of his life. It wasn&#x27;t until after his death that the work was fully published.

Blackburn was also well known for his translations from Spanish of the medieval epic Poema del Mio Cid, of poetry by Federico García Lorca, Octavio Paz, and Pablo Picasso, and of the short stories of Julio Cortázar. He was for a time Cortázar&#x27;s literary agent in the United States.

Blackburn played an important part in the poetry community, particularly in New York, where he helped fledgling poets develop. He provided logistical and emotional support for writers coming to the city and opportunities to read for both unknown and established writers in the various reading series with which he was involved. He organized readings that offered work from the Beats, the New York School, the Deep Image Poets, and the Black Mountain Poets. Clayton Eshleman has written, &quot;Many, not just a few, but many poets alive today are beholden to him for a basic artistic kindness, for readings, yes, and for advice, but more humanly for a kind of comradeship that very few poets are willing to give.&quot; The readings Blackburn organized were the direct progenitors to the St. Mark&#x27;s Poetry Project on Bowery. Additionally, Blackburn&#x27;s commitment to recording readings that he organized and attended produced the most comprehensive oral history of the New York poetry scene between the late 1950s and 1970.

Until the mid-1960s Blackburn supported himself through various print-shop, editorial and translating jobs, including a short stint as poetry editor of &quot;The Nation.&quot; Some of his early jobs included working in-house on encyclopedias and writing free-lance reviews. In the mid-60s he had a show on WBAI with interviews of, and readings by, poets. He began receiving offers of teaching positions, and in 1965, 1966 and 1967 he directed workshops at the Aspen Writers&#x27; Conference. He was Poet-In-Residence at City College of New York in 1966–67. A Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 enabled him to return to Europe to work on his translations and poetry. Upon returning to the U.S. he supported himself through reading tours and teaching at the New School and the State University of New York at Cortland.

Blackburn was married three times: to Winifred Grey McCarthy from 1954 to 1958; Sara Golden from 1963 to 1967; and Joan Diane Miller in 1968, with whom he had a son, Carlos T., in 1969.

Paul Blackburn died of esophageal cancer in Cortland, New York, September 1971.

Though Blackburn never set out to fully articulate his poetics, a good summation is the 1954 piece Statement.

<doc id="648574" wikidata="Q2085995" url="?curid=648574" title="St Clears">
<text>St Clears ( ; ) is a town on the River Taf and a community in Carmarthenshire, Wales. At the 2011 census, the population was 2,995. The community includes the small settlements of Bancyfelin and Pwlltrap. It is bordered by the Carmarthenshire towns and villages of Meidrim, Newchurch and Merthyr, Llangynog, Laugharne Township, Llanddowror, Eglwyscummin, Llanboidy and Llangynin.

==The name==
St Clare was either a church founder in the 5th/6th century (Clara), or an assembly of the Welsh bards (Clair – in Welsh).

==History==
The Priory Church of St Mary Magdalene (Church in Wales) is a grade II* listed building and was founded ; a Cluniac priory of St Martin-des-Champs. It is considered to have the best surviving Norman stone carving in Carmarthenshire. The church was restored in 1853-55 and again in 1883–84. The stained glass is from .

The Norman castle was constructed in the 12th century. St Clears, a Marcher Borough, grew around it. The castle surrendered to Owain Glyndŵr in 1405.

Nearby, Trefenty House became the home of a branch of the Perrot family in the 16th century, and it was here that the amateur astronomer Sir William Lower and a neighbour, John Protheroe, set up one of Britain&#x27;s first telescopes in 1609, which they used to study the craters of the Moon and Halley&#x27;s Comet.

Thomas Charles (1755–1814) was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist clergyman of considerable importance in the history of modern Wales. He was born of humble parentage at Longmoor, in the parish of Llanfihangel Abercywyn, near St Clears.

In 1842, St Clears was an epicentre of the &quot;Rebecca Riots&quot;. At least one local toll gate was destroyed there.

The building of the South Wales Railway in the 1850s was responsible for the decline of many of the small ports along the Bristol Channel coast, and St Clears was no exception. The railway passed about two miles north of the castle, and the new building at the north end of the High Street spread eastwards along Pentre Road, and then northwards to the station. Pentre Road is now the main commercial centre of St Clears and was formerly part of the A40 road until the bypass opened.

The town&#x27;s cattle market was important until its closure, but the town still has a large agricultural cooperative store. The town has also hosted an oil distribution centre and milk processing plant. Now, smaller industrial units provide the main local employment.

Photographer and film-maker Stanley Phillips lived in St Clears and documented life in the town and the surrounding area (active 1910–1961). His work appeared in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, as well as local newspapers. His films include &quot;The Last March of Mr. Jonah Rees at St Clears&quot; (1930), which is in the collection of the National Library of Wales. He worked closely with Colonel William Buckley (whose work is also in the National Library of Wales) and E.V. Williams, both keen filmmakers. The permanent exhibition of Phillips&#x27; photographs and film at the Mezzanine Gallery in St. Clears includes photographs of the aviator Amy Johnson, World War I flying ace Wing Commander Ira Jones, and racing drivers Sir Malcolm Campbell and J. G. Parry-Thomas, who both attempted world land speed records at nearby Pendine Sands.

Neville Hughes (1945–2015) was born in St. Clears. He was a British actor and later a successful businessman in the motor manufacturer sales and marketing sector.

==Governance==
St Clears is also an electoral ward, electing councillors to Carmarthenshire County Council and St Clears Town Council. St Clears Town Hall, which is no longer used for civic purposes, is a grade II listed building.

==Railway==

The original railway was constructed by the South Wales Railway. Although trains travel on the West Wales line through St Clears, they have not stopped since 1964. After a local campaign to persuade the Welsh Government and Network Rail to reopen St Clears railway station, funding was secured to do so by 2024.

==Amenities==
The town has a large bilingual primary school, Ysgol Griffith Jones.

There are a variety of local shops including two prize-winning traditional butchers and two craft centres. There are several pubs.

The surrounding countryside is mainly rolling grassland consisting of moderate-sized fields with well-kept hedges. The main agricultural enterprise is dairying, but sheep and beef are very important as well. The soils are deep and productive and will grow good crops of potatoes and cereals, and the climate allows fruit growing as well. Although most of the land is farmed commercially the area is a haven for wildlife.

The highlight of the farming year is the St Clears YFC annual show which is held in May.

==Sport==
St Clears AFC association football club play in the Pembrokeshire League.

<doc id="648575" wikidata="Q986359" url="?curid=648575" title="Santa María de Guía de Gran Canaria">
<text>Santa María de Guía de Gran Canaria is a town and a municipality in Las Palmas province of the Canary Islands. It is located on the north side of Gran Canaria island. Its population is (2013), and the area is .

The town Santa María de Guía is situated in a valley from the coast, west of Las Palmas. The municipality stretches from the coast into the mountainous interior of the island. The GC-2 motorway passes north of the town.

== Toponymy ==
Currently the municipality takes its name from its municipal capital, combining the invocation of its primitive hermitage founded in honor of Santa María de Guía at the end of the fifteenth century.

During the aboriginal stage of the island, which ends in the year 1483, the population nucleus received the denomination of &quot;Aguía&quot;, corresponding to the existing population in the same location of the historical center and its surroundings, and also near the aboriginal from &quot;Agaldar&quot;, capital of a guanarteme chiefdom. This denomination was maintained until 1555, as indicated in the land and water distribution documents of Gran Canaria, granted after the European conquest of the island.

After the European conquest, the historical nucleus was named as &quot;Villa de Guía&quot;, in short &quot;Guía&quot;, and it remained that way throughout the colonial period, until the 19th century. Already in the 19th century it begins to predominate the denomination of &quot;Guia de Gran Canaria&quot;, within a stream of administrative modernization, and especially to differentiate it from other homonymous populations such as Guía de Isora, on the island of Tenerife.

Already in the twentieth century and within the period of the Franco dictatorship, on December 28, 1962, the mayor of that time, Rafael Velázquez García, proposed to change the official name to that of &quot;Santa María de Guía&quot;, incorporating the invocation of the Catholic religious temple existing in the municipality since the 16th century. The change was approved in full by the local corporation on April 26, 1963, subsequently obtaining the approval of the Island Council de Gran Canaria, which had been denied in the first instance, the change being to &quot;Santa María de Guía de Gran Canaria&quot; by agreement of the Council of Ministers of the Franco government on July 23, 1963. 

In 2008, the City Council promoted a debate from the municipal website for neighbors to express their opinion on whether or not to officially retake the name of &quot;Guía de Gran Canaria&quot;. 

== Geography ==

Located in the north of Gran Canaria, the municipality has a triangular shape, which places its vertex towards the south, near the caldera of the Pinos de  Gáldar. To the east it borders the municipality of Moya defined by Barranco de Moya until its mouth. To the west, the division follows some channels, surrounds the Pico de La Atalaya or Gáldar mountain, and continues to the coast, dividing the Pico de la Atalaya in two.

The coastline is defined between Caleta de Arriba until the mouth of the Barranco de Moya. The coasts are rocky due to erosion, cliffs predominating, with exceptions such as San Felipe beach, which in summer is covered with sand.

=== Climatology ===
The climatic conditions of Santa María de Guía derive from its northern position. Thus, there are three altitudinal steps, which are:

* The coastal zone, which reaches up to 300 meters;
* The medians between 300 and 600 meters;
* The high zone, from 600 meters.

As it enters the interior of the island the number of sunny days per year is less; It rains more and temperatures are generally lower.

==Population==
==Heritage sites==

The caves of Valerón, also called &quot;cenobio de Valerón&quot;, is a property of cultural interest in the &quot;archaeological site&quot; category. It is the largest pre-Hispanic collective granary. Its size is representative of Gran Canaria agriculture, unique among the Canaries islands in that it was traditionally dominated by plantations, much of these being grains, rather than by stock-breeding.

The Quintana House is a sample of the ancient architecture of the municipality of Guia de Gran Canaria in the Canarian island of Gran Canaria, located in the Plaza Mayor de Guía and its buildings date from the 16th century.

<text>A toolchain is a set of software development tools used to build and otherwise develop software. Often, the tools are executed sequentially and form a pipeline such that the output of one tool is the input for the next. Sometimes the term is used for a set of related tools that are not necessarily executed sequentially.

A relatively common and simple toolchain consists of the tools to build for a particular operating system (OS) and CPU architecture; consisting of a compiler, a linker, and a debugger. With a cross-compiler, a toolchain can support cross-platform development.

For building more complex software systems, many other tools may be in the toolchain. For example, for a video game, the toolchain may include tools for preparing sound effects, music, textures, 3-dimensional models and animations, and for combining these resources into the finished product.

<doc id="648581" wikidata="Q657377" url="?curid=648581" title="Scottish Colourists">
<text>The Scottish Colourists were a group of four painters, three from Edinburgh, whose Post-Impressionist work, though not universally recognised initially, came to have a formative influence on contemporary Scottish art and culture. The four artists, Francis Cadell, John Duncan Fergusson, Leslie Hunter and Samuel Peploe, were prolific painters spanning the turn of the twentieth century until the beginnings of World War II. While now banded as one group with a collective achievement and a common sense of British identity, it is a misnomer to believe their artwork or their painterly careers were heterogeneous.

Generally however, the group shared a common interest in the artistic developments occurring in France and are shown to dabble with different styles such as Cubism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Futurism. The movement seemed to fall out of favour by the end of World War II, and did not experience a revival until the 1980s.

Their works are currently held in a number of Scottish art galleries, including the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.

== History ==
The Scottish Colourists combined their training in France and the work of French Impressionists and Fauvists, such as Monet, Matisse and Cézanne, with the painting traditions of Scotland. A forerunner of this movement was William McTaggart (1835–1910), a Scottish landscape painter who was influenced by Post-Impressionism. He is regarded as one of the great interpreters of the Scottish landscape and is often labelled the &quot;Scottish Impressionist&quot;.

Largely recognised as the leading figure of the group was Samuel Peploe. The other Scottish Colourists were Francis Cadell, John Duncan Fergusson and Leslie Hunter.

The expression ‘Scottish Colourists’ according to Macmillan may have first been used as early as 1915 in the &quot;Studio&quot; magazine. Its specific association in print, again according to Macmillan, seems to have been first used by T J Honeyman, the art critic and director of Glasgow Art Gallery, in his book &quot;Three Scottish Colourists&quot; published in 1950.

The four artists did in fact exhibit together, for the first time in 1924 in Paris at an exhibition at the Galerie Barbazanges entitled ‘Les Peintres de l’Ecosse Moderne’ (Bilcliffe) . The following year, they showed together at an exhibition in London at the Leicester Gallery. In total, the four artists exhibited three times over the course of their lives.

The Scottish Colourists were internationally known during their lifetimes but their work fell out of favour by World War II, until they were rediscovered in the 1980s and subsequently played an influential role in the development of Scottish art.

== Artistic style ==
While each of the four artists had a unique style, their work shared common interests in experimentation with light and shade, planar brushstrokes, bold use of colour, and a vibrant and confident tone. Their subject matter is often considered conservative compared to their French counterparts, since much of it consisted of island landscapes, Edinburgh interiors and fashionable models.

Much of their early work was influenced by the likes of Édouard Manet and the French Impressionists. Manet’s influence can be seen in both the Colourists’ early colour scheme, which used soft, muted tones, and in their thick brushstrokes. Peploe&#x27;s &#x27;White Period&#x27; shows such influence with the subtle balance of tone and colour, and a rich creaminess in the paint&#x27;s texture.

However, as French visual culture developed in the early 20th century, so did the Colourists&#x27; artistic style. J.D. Fergusson was the first in the group to feel the influence of the Cubists and Futurists, who experimented with rhythm as a way to connect the foreground and background of works. Rhythm became a continuous trend in his work, with critics later commenting on his outstanding ability to translate the joy and musicality of his subjects through his use of colour. Alongside Cubism, later experiments with the styles of Post-Impressionism can be seen in the Matisse-like use of green paint to convey shadows, and the structural and tonal landscape compositions influenced by Cézanne.

This is not to say that the movement only copied the styles and themes of French art. They &quot;absorbed and reworked the strong and vibrant colours of contemporary French painting into a distinctive Scottish idiom during the 1920s and 1930s&quot;. Peploe stated that his style was an attempt to simultaneously find truth through light, form and colour, while also remain faithful to one’s own emotions and understandings of the art he is creating. The impact of the Scottish Celticism movement can be seen in the works of J.D. Fergusson. Celticism focused on abstract forms and detailed surface pattern, rearranging space, and composition in an almost Cubist capacity.

== Major collections ==
Their work is featured in the Aberdeen Art Gallery in Aberdeen, Scotland; the J. D. Fergusson Gallery in Perth, Scotland; the University of Stirling, The Hunterian, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh, and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. The Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery is said to house the largest collection of works by Peploe and McTaggart. From 18 October 2019 - 1 February 2020 Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal, hosted an exhibition of the Scottish Colourists largely based on works from the Fleming Collection.

<doc id="648582" wikidata="Q422037" url="?curid=648582" title="Phenanthrene">
<text>Phenanthrene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with formula C14H10, consisting of three fused benzene rings. It is a colorless, crystal-like solid, but can also appear yellow. Phenanthrene is used to make dyes, plastics, pesticides, explosives, and drugs. It has also been used to make bile acids, cholesterol and steroids.

Phenanthrene occurs naturally and also is a man-made chemical. Commonly, humans are exposed to phenanthrene through inhalation of cigarette smoke, but there are many routes of exposure. Animal studies have shown that phenanthrene is a potential carcinogen. However, according to IARC, it is not identified as a probable, possible or confirmed human carcinogen.

Phenanthrene&#x27;s three fused rings are angled as in the phenacenes, rather than straight as in the acenes. The compounds with a phenanthrene skeleton but with nitrogen atoms in place of CH sites are known as phenanthrolines.

== History and etymology ==
Phenanthrene was discovered in coal tar in 1872 independently by Carl Graebe (article manuscript received on November 1st) as well as by Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig and his doctoral student (manuscript received on November 19th but Ostermayer&#x27;s dissertation defended in August). Fittig and Ostermayer were able to determine the structure of the compound by oxidizing it first to a corresponding quinone and then to diphenic acid, and soon Graebe confirmed it by a synthesis from stilbene.

Prior to February 1873 Fittig sent a letter to Graebe where he proposed to name the hydrocarbon phenanthrene () in order to account for its similarity to biphenyl and anthracene, which was swiftly adopted.

==Physical properties==

Phenanthrene is nearly insoluble in water but is soluble in most low-polarity organic solvents such as toluene, carbon tetrachloride, ether, chloroform, acetic acid and benzene.

Phenanthrene is fluorescent under ultraviolet light, exhibiting a large Stoke shift. It can be used in scintillators.

==Chemistry==

Reactions of phenanthrene typically occur at the 9 and 10 positions, including:
* Oxidation with chromic acid gives gives phenanthrenequinone.
* Organic reduction to 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene with hydrogen gas and raney nickel
* Electrophilic halogenation to 9-bromophenanthrene with bromine
* Aromatic sulfonation to 2 and 3-phenanthrenesulfonic acids with sulfuric acid
* Ozonolysis to diphenylaldehyde

==Productions==
Phenanthrene is extracted from coal tar, where it comprises 5% by weight.

In principle it could be obtained by chemical synthesis. The Bardhan–Sengupta phenanthrene synthesis is a classic way to make phenanthrenes.

This process involves electrophilic aromatic substitution using a tethered cyclohexanol group using diphosphorus pentoxide, which closes the central ring onto an existing aromatic ring. Dehydrogenation using selenium aromatizes the other rings into aromatic ones as well. The aromatization of six-membered rings produces H2Se.

Phenanthrene can also be obtained photochemically from certain diarylethenes (Mallory reaction):

Other synthesis routes include the Haworth reaction and the Wagner-Meerwein-type ring-expansion, as depicted below: Commercially phenanthrene is not synthesized but extracted from the byproducts of coal coking, since it makes around 4–6% of coke oven coal tar.

== Natural occurrences of the phenanthrene derivatives==

Morphinan is the chemical structure found in several psychoactive drugs, consisting of opiate analgesics, cough suppressants, and dissociative hallucinogens, among others. Examples morphine, codeine, and dextromethorphan (DXM).

Ravatite is a natural mineral consisting of phenanthrene. It is found in small amounts among a few coal burning sites. Ravatite represents a small group of organic minerals.

=== In plants ===
Phenanthrene derivatives occur in plants as phenanthrenoids. They have been reported from flowering plants, mainly in the family Orchidaceae, and a few in the families Dioscoreaceae, Combretaceae and Betulaceae, as well as in the lower plant class Marchantiophyta (liverworts).

<text>Courtelary is a municipality of the French-speaking Bernese Jura, in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. The town is the capital of the Jura bernois administrative district.

==History==

Courtelary is first mentioned in 968 as &quot;Curtis Alerici&quot; in a list of the properties of Moutier-Grandval Abbey. In 1179, Pope Alexander III elevated the Abbot to a Canon and confirmed the Abbots title to Courtelary.

In addition to Moutier-Granval Abbey, the Cathedral chapter of Saint-Imier owned properties in the village which were managed for them by the Lords of Fenis-Neuchâtel. However, while under the control of the Lords of Fenis-Neuchâtel, the valley became a bailiwick of the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The Prince-Bishop placed the valley under the Seigniory of Erguel. By the late 13th century, Seigniory was controlled by the town of Biel.

Due to the rising popularity of the cult of St. Imerius, in the 10th or 11th century a small Church of St. Imerius was built in the village. The original building was expanded in 1372, 1642 and finally in 1773. During a restoration in 1933–36, several 11th century murals were discovered in the building. The Courtelary parish was first mentioned in the 13th century. In 1530, Biel began forcing the entire Erguel region to accept the Protestant Reformation. This interference in local affairs pushed the residents of the valley to create an alliance with the town of Solothurn. In 1604 with Solothurn&#x27;s support, the appeals court moved from Biel to Courtelary which brought limited self-rule back to the valley. Two years later the seat of the Erguel Bailiwick moved to Courtelary&#x27;s New Castle (which later became the town hall). During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in 1639, the village was plundered and partially burned by the troops of Bernard of Saxe-Weimar.

In 1726, the Prince-Bishop of Basel, Johann Konrad von Reinach-Hirzbach, attempted to modernize and consolidate his extensive land holdings. He tried to sweep away the numerous local laws, customs and rights and replace them with a central government ruled according to the principles of enlightened absolutism. Riots and revolts against the new government broke out almost immediately in the Erguel valley and the region remained a center of anti-government activity. In 1733 a meeting at the Courtelary Castle exploded into a riot and the Prince-Bishop&#x27;s bailiff, Benoît-Aimé Mestrezat, was forced to flee the city. In 1792 and 1793, heavily influenced by the French Revolution, the revolutionary National Assembly of Erguel was established in Courtelary. Revolutionaries flocked to the town and established a short-lived Republic of Erguel. In 1797 the French invaded the lands of the Bishop of Basel and established the Canton of Courtelary with Courtelary as the capital. The Canton was initially part of the Department of Mont-Terrible followed by the Department of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, in 1815, the Erguel region became part of the Canton of Bern. Courtelary was the capital of the District of Erguel until 1831 when it became the capital of the District of Courtelary.
Courtelary remained a rural and agricultural town until the early 20th Century. The farms on the valley floor produced grain for local use. In contrast, the surrounding mountain pastures were used by Anabaptist sharecroppers to raise dairy cattle and other livestock. They then produced butter and cheese which they exported. In 1874 the Biel-Les Convers-La Chaux-de-Fonds railroad was built through the town. The lower transportation costs from the railroad allowed a wood pulp factory to be built in Courtelary. In 1935, the Camille Bloch chocolate factory moved into the old wood pulp building. Other than the chocolate factory, manufacturing developed very slowly in Courtelary. A few precision machine and watch parts factories were built during the early 20th century, but during the 1970s these industries declined. In the following decades the industrial sector rebounded and in 2000 about 47% of the working population worked in industry.

<text>Ystradgynlais (; ) is a town in southwest Powys, Wales. It is located on the River Tawe, and was within the boundaries of the former county of Brecknockshire. The town has a high proportion of Welsh language-speakers. The community includes Cwmtwrch, Abercraf and Cwmgiedd, with a population of 8,092 in the 2011 census; it is the second-largest town in Powys. It forms part of the Swansea Urban Area where the Ystradgynlais subdivision has a population of 10,248.

==History==
The place-name Ystradgynlais, meaning &#x27;vale of the river Cynlais&#x27; – Cynlais may be a personal name, or derive from &quot;cyn&quot; (&#x27;chisel&#x27;) and &quot;glais&quot; (&#x27;stream&#x27;) – is first recorded in 1372. In the 1600s there were only a couple of houses by the church and a pub (now the rectory). In 1801 there were only 993 residents in the town living in only 196 houses. The first documented written evidence of iron working in the area was at Ynyscedwyn and is of a deed of release dated 1729. By 1750 there were seven furnaces in south Wales, one of which was at Ynyscedwyn.

Tynycoed Chapel, located between Ynyswen and Penycae, near Ystradgynlais, was first constructed in 1774, and was rebuilt in 1829.

The first written evidence of coal mining was at Wauclawdd in 1780. Most of the coal dug up was used in the blast furnaces of the ironworks. By 1790, the full extent of the mineral resources in the valley was better known and it was realised that to exploit these to the full, improved transport would be essential.

The greatest increase in the population was between 1821 and 1841. This coincides with the coming of George Crane and the development of the Ynyscedwyn Ironworks. By 1870, the town&#x27;s industrial development was in decline due to various economic factors, although coal mining carried on in the area with a few light industries.

==Culture==

Ystradgynlais hosted the 1954 National Eisteddfod, an annual Welsh festival of literature, dance, and music. The century-old award-winning Ystradgynlais Public Band competed in the 2005 National Eisteddfod.

Ystradgynlais&#x27;s Parc-yr-Orsedd has a monument to the fallen heroes of both World Wars from Ystradgynlais, Abercrave, Cwmtwrch, Cwmgiedd, Glyntawe and Coelbren.

Dan yr Ogof caves are a short journey from the town centre, passing Craig-y-Nos Castle and country park. The caves are reputed to have once been the hideout of folk figure Twm Siôn Cati. Henrhyd Falls are also nearby.

Ystradgynlais is also home to the Miners Welfare Hall, known and promoted as &#x27;The Welfare&#x27;, which contains a cinema. In 2020 a Purple Plaque was installed at the building to mark Eunice Stallard&#x27;s life and activity as a peace campaigner.

It also has a number of public houses. For 11 years, from 1944m the town was the home of Polish artist Josef Herman, who stayed for the first four years in rooms at the Pen-y-Bont Inn. He became part of the community, where he was fondly nicknamed &quot;Joe Bach&quot; (Little Joe). Herman is quoted as saying: &quot;I stayed here because I found ALL I required. I arrived a stranger for a fortnight. The fortnight became eleven years.&quot;

In 2016 The Stephen Lewis Tristars Aquathlon in Ystradgynlais won the Welsh triathlon event of the Year 2016.

==Transport==
National Cycle Route 43 passes by the southern edge of the town on the line of the former Swansea Vale Railway which linked Swansea via the Neath and Brecon Railway at Coelbren with Brecon. Ystradgynlais railway station was operational from 1869 to 1923.

The A4067 road linking West Cross, Swansea, with Sennybridge ran through the town until the 1970s, when it was diverted onto the bypass that follows the line of the former Swansea Canal.

Ystradgynlais has a bus station, served hourly by the First Cymru-operated X6 to and from Swansea, as well as the long-distance TrawsCymru T6 between Swansea and Brecon.

==Sport==
The town is the home of Ystradgynlais F.C. and Ystradgynlais RFC. Ystradgynlais RFC was established in 1890 and has a fierce rivalry with Ystalyfera RFC and Abercrave RFC.

==Watchmaking==
In 1946, Smiths Industries Ltd, Ingersoll Ltd and Vickers Armstrong founded the Anglo-Celtic Watch Co. Ltd. producing watches on the Ynyscedwyn estate on the outskirts of Ystradgynlais. The factory was officially opened by Hugh Dalton on 15 March 1947. Vickers Armstrong sold their shares to the other two companies in 1948. The company became one of the largest producers of watches in Europe, producing up to 1.25 million watches a year until 1980 when it closed.

<text>Abersoch () is a village in the community of Llanengan in Gwynedd, Wales. It is a popular coastal seaside resort, with around 2,600 residents, on the east-facing south coast of the Llŷn Peninsula at the southern terminus of the A499. It is about south-west of Pwllheli and south-west of the county town of Caernarfon.

==Etymology==
The village takes its name from the river Soch, which reaches the sea in the village. &#x27;Aber&#x27; meaning &#x27;estuary&#x27;, gives us a literal translation of the &#x27;Soch Estuary&#x27;. The name of the village is often rendered &quot;Rabar&quot; in the local Welsh dialect.
==Archaeology==
In the dry summer of 2018, aerial photography at Fach Farm, some 1100 metres north of the bridge over the Afon Soch, identified crop marks that were reported as a possible Roman fortlet. High-resolution geophysics in 2019 revealed evidence of a complex defended enclosure, unlike Roman military structures but suggesting a pre-Roman date.

==Tourism==
Built upon the fishing trade, Abersoch was once a small village which grew exponentially after the 1950s with the rise of tourism. The fishing port which was guided by the &quot;Abersoch Fishermen&#x27;s Society&quot; (which was replaced with the active &quot;Pysgotwyr Llŷn Fishermen&#x27;s Association&quot;) is still being used for fishing, however it is no longer the village&#x27;s major source of income.

It is now a tourist centre specialising in dinghy sailing and other watersports such as windsurfing and jet-skiing. Nearby Porth Neigwl is also popular for surfing; it can hold large swells in the winter which can reach ; however, the prevailing south-westerly winds can affect quality.

The village had a lifeboat station from 1869 until 1931. A new inshore lifeboat station was opened in 1965.

Central Abersoch has a variety of small shops as well as bars, restaurants, cafes and hotels. Boat trips around St Tudwal&#x27;s Islands (one of which is owned by the famous survival instructor, Bear Grylls) to see the seals and other wildlife are available from the village. Abersoch is also popular for its close proximity to Snowdonia National Park, with Snowdon being visible from Abersoch Bay on clear days. There is an 18-hole golf course.
Abersoch was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.
Because of Abersoch&#x27;s popularity with tourists, particularly from northwest England and the western Midlands, there has been an increase in the sale of holiday homes in the area, and of the conversion of old properties into holiday lets. This has led locals, through the YesCymru campaign, to protest against rising house prices which push families away from the coastal towns where they were raised, as a result of high numbers of holiday lets compared with low numbers of families, Abersoch primary school was forced to close. Gwynedd Council has called for the Welsh government to step in to limit the number of homes allotted to each area.

== Demographics ==

=== Country of birth ===
According to the 2011 UK Census, 97.2% of the population was born in the United Kingdom. Although situated in Wales, the majority of the village&#x27;s population (51.1%) was born in England, with only 44.7% having been born in Wales.

=== Identity ===
The 2011 Census demonstrated that 60.4% of the population had no Welsh identity. 34.0% of the population identified themselves as Welsh only. The surrounding community of Llanengan is considerably less Anglicised.

=== Welsh language ===

43.5% of the population aged 3 and over noted that they could speak Welsh. 52.1% noted that they had one or more skills in the Welsh language. Of those who were born in Wales, 85% of the population aged three and over noted that they could speak Welsh.

In June 2021, a Welsh language primary school &#x27;Ysgol Abersoch&#x27; was threatened with closure, where the current school-children would be transferred to the closest school at &#x27;Ysgol Sarn bach&#x27; which is located 1.4 miles away. In September 2021, despite over 200 objections from the public, the council unanimously voted to shut the school down. It closed at Christmas, 2021.

The neighbouring village of Sarn Bach has a Welsh-medium primary school for 3 to 11 year olds. As of 2017, the two schools between them educated 72 pupils. According to the latest Estyn reports conducted in 2017, 39% of pupils in Ysgol Abersoch primary school came from Welsh-speaking homes, with 47% of pupils of Sarn Bach pupils coming from homes where Welsh was spoken.

The closest specialist school to Abersoch is Ysgol Hafod Lon in Penrhyndeudraeth.

&quot;Ysgol Botwnnog,&quot; situated inland from Abersoch, provides Welsh-medium secondary education to pupils from the village.

<text>Grossaffoltern is a municipality in the Seeland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is known for its stork colony.

==History==

Grossaffoltern is first mentioned in 1216 as &quot;Affoltron&quot;.

The oldest evidence of humans in the Grossaffoltern area are neolithic objects at Vorimholz, an Early Bronze Age ax blade depot at Munimatte and Bronze Age items at Kosthofen. There are at least 38 Hallstatt era grave mounds scattered around the municipality. The area was also inhabited during the Roman era and the Early Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages it was owned by the House of Zähringen until that family died out, when it was inherited by the Kyburgs. Under the Zähringens and the Kyburgs, during the 13th and 14th centuries, it was part of the district of Oltigen. In 1412, Grossaffoltern and the surrounding villages came under Bernese control. It was originally part of the bailiwick of Oltigen until that was dissolved in 1483, when it became part of the bailiwick of Aarberg allocated. Under the Helvetic Republic, in 1798, Grossaffoltern was in the Zollikofen district before switching back to the Aarberg district in 1803.

The village church of St. Stephen was first mentioned in 1275. The current church building is from 1510 to 1524, though it was built on top of the foundations of two 12th or 13th century churches. The church tower is from the 14th century. In 1383 it was given by Anna of Kyburg-Nidau to the monastery of Klingental near Basel. The monastery sold the church in 1416 to the Abbey of Frienisberg. Under Frienisberg it became the parish church of the local parish in 1451. The parish came under Bernese control in 1528.

This was followed in 1864 by a railroad and in 1983 by a highway, all of which boosted the local economy. Due to the good transportation connections, starting the 1960s, the number of commuters living in Grossaffoltern rose sharply. In 1967, Grossaffoltern and six surrounding villages merged into a single municipality to streamline government and centralize services.

<text>Ardudwy () is an area of Gwynedd in north-west Wales, lying between Tremadog Bay and the Rhinogydd. Administratively, under the old Kingdom of Gwynedd, it was first a division of the sub kingdom (cantref) of Dunoding and later a commote in its own right. The fertile swathe of land stretching from Barmouth to Harlech was historically used as pasture. The name exists in the modern community and village of Dyffryn Ardudwy.

==History and mythology==
Ardudwy features prominently in Welsh mythology, &quot;the Triads of the Island of Britain&quot; heavily associates Ardudwy with the flooding of Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod, stating that survivors of the flooding moved into the area in the time of Ambrosius Aurelianus, as well as surrounding areas that were previously uninhabited. In the Second Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi,&quot; Bendigeidfran holds court at Harlech, and his severed head returns there for seven years before it is taken on to Gwales. In the Fourth Branch, Lleu Llaw Gyffes is given Eifionydd and Ardudwy as his fief by Math fab Mathonwy. Lleu built his palace at &quot;Mur y Castell&quot; in Ardudwy. He reigned there before and after the usurpation of Gronw Pebr, whom he killed on the banks of the River Cynfael. A holed stone in Ardudwy is still known as &quot;Llech Ronw&quot; (Gronw&#x27;s Stone).

Ardudwy is later associated with the ninth-century chieftain Collwyn ap Tango, the progenitor of the fifth of the Fifteen Noble Tribes of Gwynedd. He was Lord of Ardudwy and is a maternal ancestor of the Anwyl of Tywyn Family. Ardudwy was a core part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd above the River Conwy throughout the early Middle Ages. After the conquest and subjugation of Gwynedd in 1283, the cantref was merged with Meirionydd to form the new county of Merionethshire. This situation was retained until 1974, when Welsh Local Government was reorganised and it became part of the reformed Gwynedd, where it remains .

<text>Llanbedr () is a village and community south of Harlech. Administratively, it lies in the Ardudwy area, formerly Meirionnydd, of the county of Gwynedd, Wales. In 2011 the community had a population of 645.

==History==
Ancient monuments at Llanbedr include Neolithic standing stones; the Stones of Llanbedr and Bronze Age hut circles. 
The village originally grew around the slate quarrying industry.
Glyn Pedr is a Victorian Grade II listed residence on Maes Ffynnon.

During the First World War, Marian Antonia Gamwell, a widow, created a British Red Cross auxiliary hospital at her new home, the country house called Aber Artro, at Llanbedr.

==Climate==
==Church and chapel==
The church of St Peter, after whom the village is named (Pedr being the Welsh for Peter), is a Grade II* listed building.

In 2019 approval was given to convert Capel Moriah in Llanbedr, which had gone out of use, into a Mosque.

About east of the village centre is the hamlet of Pentre Gwynfryn whose chapel, Capel Salem, was the subject of a painting by the artist Sydney Curnow Vosper. The painting, entitled &quot;Salem&quot;, showed a member of the congregation, Siân Owen, in traditional Welsh costume and became famous throughout Britain in the mid-20th century.

==Airport==
The village is home to Llanbedr Airport, a general aviation aerodrome. Until 2004, the site was operated as a military airfield by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and QinetiQ as a launch site for remotely piloted drone &#x27;aircraft&#x27; for use as aerial targets by the RAF and other UK forces. The airfield was included in the Snowdonia Enterprise Zone by the Welsh Government in January 2013.

In 2018, the airport became home to a flying school offering pleasure flights and flying lessons.

After the UK passed 2021 enabling legislation, in 2022, the Welsh Government announced plans to develop space launch capability at the site, to be named Spaceport Snowdonia.

==Amenities==

The Morfa Dyffryn sand dunes and Mochras (Shell Island) lie nearby. It has two public houses.

To the north of the village is the smaller village of Pensarn, situated at the estuary of the River Artro. This is the location of Llanbedr &amp; Pensarn Yacht Club and the Christian Mountain Centre, a residential adventure activity centre.

==Railways==
Llanbedr railway station, formerly known as Talwrn Bach Halt, is a little out of the village itself and is served by the Cambrian Line.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name existed. This ward also covered the Community of Llanfair. The total ward population at the 2011 Census was 1,098. From the 2022 Gwynedd Council election the ward was merged with Harlech, renamed &quot;Harlech a Llanbedr&quot; and the representation increased to 2 county councillors.

==Twinning==
In 2008 Llanbedr was twinned with Huchenfeld, Germany, following many years of exchanges between schools, churches, musicians and community leaders, in remembrance of the occurrences at Pforzheim and Huchenfeld during the Second World War.

== Notable people ==
* Henry Lloyd (ca.1718 – 1783), a Welsh army officer and military writer.
* Katherine Mudge (1881–1975), a British archer; she competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. 
* Sir Philip Pullman CBE FRSL (born 1946), an English writer; his formative years were spent in Llanbedr.

<text>Hendon Football Club is a semi-professional football club representing Hendon in the London Borough of Barnet, but playing their home matches in Kingsbury in the London Borough of Brent. They are currently members of the and play at Silver Jubilee Park in Kingsbury.

==History==
The club was established as Christchurch Hampstead in 1908. They joined the Third Division of the Finchley &amp; District League, which they won at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division Two. At the start of the 1909–10 season the club were renamed Hampstead Town and they went on to win Division Two at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One. For the 1911–12 season the club entered teams into both Division One of the Finchley &amp; District League and Division Two of the London League. They won the Finchley &amp; District League title, and a fourth-place finish in Division Two of the London League saw the club promoted to Division One. They subsequently entered a team into the Middlesex League alongside the London League team.

In 1912–13 Hampstead Town were runners-up in Division One of the London League, earning promotion to the Premier Division (Amateur); they also won the Middlesex League. The following season saw them win both the Middlesex League and the Premier Division (Amateur) of the London League. This success saw the club admitted to the Athenian League for the 1914–15 season. However, the league was abandoned after two games due to World War I. After the war they played in the United Senior League in the 1918–19 season and won the league, before returning to the Athenian League when it restarted in 1919. The club was renamed Hampstead in 1926. They were Athenian League runners-up in 1928–29 and again in 1932–33, before being renamed Golders Green in 1933. They reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in 1934–35, losing 10–1 at Third Division South Southend United. In 1946 the club was renamed again, adopting its current name, that of a club that existed in the 19th century.

Hendon were Athenian League runners-up in 1947–48, 1948–49 and 1951–52 before winning their first Athenian League title in 1952–53, a season which also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 2–0 at Northampton Town in a replay. In 1954–55 they reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup, losing 2–0 to Bishop Auckland at Wembley. They went on to win the Athenian League title again in 1955–56, also reaching the second round of the FA Cup, beating Halesowen Town 4–2 in the first round before losing 6–2 at Exeter City in the second. The club won their first Amateur Cup in 1959–60, defeating Kingstonian 2–1 in the final. A third Athenian League title was won in 1960–61. In 1963 the club switched to the Isthmian League. They were runners-up in their first season in the league. In their second season, 1964–65, the club won the Isthmian League and Amateur Cup double, defeating Whitby Town 3–1 in the final.

Hendon reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup again the following season, but lost 3–1 to Wealdstone. After winning their third Amateur Cup with a 2–0 win against Enfield in 1971–72, a second Isthmian League title was won in 1972–73. The following season they reached the third round of the FA Cup, where they drew Newcastle United; after holding them to a 1–1 draw at St James&#x27; Park, Hendon lost 4–0 in a replay played at Watford&#x27;s Vicarage Road. In 1975–76 the club defeated a Football League club for the first time, beating Reading 1–0 in the first round, before losing to Swindon Town in the second round.

In 2003–04 Hendon finished fourth in the Isthmian League Premier Division but declined to join the new Conference South. Having remained in the top division of the Isthmian League since joining it in 1963, Hendon finished in the relegation zone at the end of the 2005–06 season, but were reprieved after Canvey Island&#x27;s resignation from the Football Conference. During the summer of 2010, the club was bought out by the Hendon FC Supporters Trust, an Industrial and Provident Society. In 2014–15 they were Premier Division runners-up, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; after beating Metropolitan Police 2–1 in the semi-finals, they lost the final 1–0 to Margate. The 2017–18 season saw the club finish third in the Premier Division. In the subsequent play-offs, they defeated Folkestone Invicta 4–0 in the semi-finals before losing the final 4–3 on penalties to Dulwich Hamlet. The club were placed in the Premier Division South of the Southern League for the 2018–19 season as part of the restructuring of the non-League pyramid.

At the end of the 2023–24 season Hendon were transferred back to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League.

==Ground==

The club moved to Claremont Road in Cricklewood in 1926. The first match was played on 18 September, an FA Cup game against Berkhamsted that Hendon won 4–3. The ground was also briefly used by rugby league club London Broncos. In the mid-2000s the ground was sold to property developers and it was initially planned that the club would move to Barnet Copthall. However, the proposed move fell through following the passing of Club Chairman Ivor Arbiter and although Hendon had initially expected to leave in 2006, they were still at the ground in 2008; the final match at Claremont Road on 20 September 2008 saw local rivals Wealdstone win 4–1.

After leaving Claremont Road Hendon played at Northwood&#x27;s Chestnut Avenue, Staines Town&#x27;s Wheatsheaf Road for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. They then moved to Wembley&#x27;s Vale Farm before relocating to Harrow Borough&#x27;s Earlsmead ground in 2013. In 2016 they moved to Silver Jubilee Park in Kingsbury on a groundshare with Edgware Town.

The anglicised spelling for the village and community is Aberdovey. The Welsh &quot;Aberdyfi&quot; is now widely used locally and by the Gwynedd Council and the Welsh Government.

The body responsible for providing advice on the standard forms of Welsh place-names, the Welsh Language Commissioner, recommends &quot;Aberdyfi&quot; to be the standard form for use in both English and Welsh. Some entities continue to use the anglicisation e.g. some local businesses in their name and/or address and some use the two spellings interchangeably e.g. the BBC or under different circumstances e.g. the Aberdyfi Community Council.

==History==

Local tradition suggests that the Romans established a track into the area as part of the military occupation of Wales around AD78.

The strategic location in mid-Wales was the site of several conferences between north and south Wales princes in 540, 1140, and for the Council of Aberdyfi in 1216. The hill in the centre of the village, Pen-y-Bryn, has been claimed to be the site of fortifications in the 1150s, which were soon destroyed. The site of Aberdyfi Castle however is usually said to be at the motte earthworks further up the opposite side of the river near Glandyfi.

During the Spanish Armada of 1597, a Spanish ship, the &quot;Bear of Amsterdam&quot; missed her objective at Milford Haven and ended up having entered the Dyfi estuary. She was unable to leave for 10 days because of the wind and could not be boarded as no suitable boats were available. An attempt to burn her was frustrated by winds and when she did leave she ended up being captured by a waiting English fleet off the Cornish coast.

In the 1700s, the village grew with the appearance of several of the inns still in current use (The Dovey Hotel, Britannia and Penhelig Arms). Copper was mined in the present Copperhill Street, and lead in Penhelig ().
===Port and railway===
In the 1800s, Aberdyfi was at its peak as a port. Major exports were slate and oak bark. Ship building was based in seven shipyards in Penhelig where 45 sailing ships were built between 1840 and 1880.

The railway came to the village in 1863 built by the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway. The first train was ferried across the river, as the line to Dovey Junction and then Machynlleth was not completed until 1867. Due to public demand, this section had to use a long tunnel behind the village centre, and further major earthworks and tunnels were needed along the bank of the river. This line, which became part of the Cambrian Railways, and later the Great Western Railway, is particularly scenic.

A jetty was built in 1887, with railway lines connecting it with the wharf and the main line. The Aberdyfi &amp; Waterford Steamship Company imported livestock from Ireland which were then taken further by the railway. Coal, limestone and timber were also imported.

Local coastal shipping links with Liverpool were strong, with many Aberdyfi men sailing on international voyages from Liverpool. The was one of the last ships trading between Aberdyfi and Liverpool and was scuttled, with no loss of life, by a German submarine in 1917.

The jetty and wharf continued in commercial use for coal until 1959. After prolonged negotiations, redevelopments from 1968 to 1971, including rebuilding the jetty, led to their present use mainly for recreational purposes. Some local fishing still occurs.

The first ever Outward Bound centre was opened in the village in 1941. Many of their activities involve the river, boats and jetty.

===Lifeboat===

The village&#x27;s first lifeboat was bought in 1837. Run by the RNLI since 1853, it has taken part in many rescues, sometimes with loss of life of crew members. The current lifeboat, an Atlantic 75, is housed in the boathouse by the jetty and is launched using a lifeboat tractor. Currently it is averaging about 25 emergency launches each year.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name stretches inland along the A494 road and includes Pennal community. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 1,282.

==Worship==
Chapels in Aberdyfi include the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel, the English Presbyterian chapel, the Wesleyan Methodist chapel, and the Welsh Independent congregational chapel. The Anglican (Church in Wales) is St Peter&#x27;s.

==Transport==
Road access to Aberdyfi is by the A493, with Tywyn four miles to the north and Machynlleth 11 miles to the east. The village is on the Cambrian Coast railway line and has two railway stations, and . Trains on the Cambrian Line are operated by Transport for Wales. The local bus service is operated by Lloyds Coaches with services to Tywyn, where a connection can be made for Dolgellau, and to Machynlleth, where connections are available to Aberystwyth.

A ferry used to operate across the River Dyfi to Ynyslas. The last ferryman was Ellis Williams.

==Recreation==
Popular recreational activities focus on the beach and watersports, such as windsurfing, kitesurfing, fishing, crabbing, sailing, and canoeing on the estuary.
The Dovey Yacht Club has a prominent position on the river front of the village. It was founded in 1949 and helped develop the popularity of the GP14 dinghy class. It organises races for dinghies throughout the season on the estuary of the River Dyfi.

The Aberdovey Golf Club, founded in 1892, is a famous 18 hole links course located near the railway station. It is world-renowned, having been described frequently and lyrically in the press by Bernard Darwin, the famed golf writer, who was a notable member of the club. In 1895, it was the location of the first Welsh Golfing Union Championship. Current members include Ian Woosnam and Peter Baker.

Located by the Aberdovey Golf Club is Aberdyfi Football club boasting one of the best football pitches in Mid-Wales. The football team won the Welsh Amateur Cup Competition in 1934.

The Aberdyfi Rowing Club rows in the Dyfi Estuary and Cardigan Bay and takes part in races all round the coast of Wales and internationally. They row 24’ long Celtic longboats, with four rowers (each with one oar) and a cox. They have three of these traditional Welsh boats with fixed seats and use these for races in Wales.

The Aberdovey Literary Institute, founded in 1882, is situated on the river front. The deeds of 1923 state it was established in perpetuity as &quot;a non-sectarian, non-political place of recreation, education and social intercourse including ... reading rooms, writing rooms, library, billiard rooms, concert rooms ...&quot;

Neuadd Dyfi is a community hall, conference centre and theatre owned by the village for village activities. It caters for a range of local organisations and events.

==Cultural references==

===The Bells of Aberdovey===

Aberdyfi is closely linked to the legend of the submerged lost kingdom of Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod () beneath Cardigan Bay, and bells which, it is said, can be heard ringing beneath the water at the beach. &quot;The Bells of Aberdovey&quot; () is a well-known song referring to this legend. This song first appeared in the English opera &quot;Liberty Hall&quot; in 1785, written by Charles Dibdin, and is not thought to be a traditional folk-song as Welsh words were written by John Ceiriog Hughes, during the 19th century.

The legend and the song have inspired local cultural projects involving bells.

A new chime of bells was installed in September 1936 in the tower of St Peter&#x27;s Church, which overlooks the harbour. The ten bells, tuned in the key of A flat, were specifically designed to allow the playing of &quot;The Bells of Aberdovey&quot; and are played from a mechanical carillon inside the church.
In 2010 an art installation was commissioned from sculptor Marcus Vergette as a homage to &quot;The Bells of Aberdovey&quot;. The work is a bronze Time and Tide Bell suspended beneath the pier which is rung by the action of water at high tide. It was installed in July 2011 and is one of several such bells around the United Kingdom.

===Other===
To the east of Aberdyfi is a path from Penhelig to Picnic Island () known as the Old Roman Road (). In reality, the path is known to have existed as early as the 19th century and the nearest known Roman structure on this side of the estuary was the fort Cefn Caer at Pennal.

&quot;Bugail Aberdyfi&quot; (the Shepherd of Aberdovey) is a poem written by John Ceiriog Hughes which has been set to music and recorded by several singers including Bryn Terfel.

The children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, by Susan Cooper, the final book of &quot;The Dark is Rising&quot;, is largely set around Aberdyfi, with many references to local landmarks.

The novel, &quot;Megan&#x27;s Game&quot; by Tony Drury, published in 2012, contains many references to Aberdyfi, surrounding areas and the legend of &quot;The Bells of Aberdovey&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the exponential integral Ei is a special function on the complex plane.
It is defined as one particular definite integral of the ratio between an exponential function and its argument.

==Definitions==
For real non-zero values of &quot;x&quot;, the exponential integral Ei(&quot;x&quot;) is defined as

:formula_1

The Risch algorithm shows that Ei is not an elementary function. The definition above can be used for positive values of &quot;x&quot;, but the integral has to be understood in terms of the Cauchy principal value due to the singularity of the integrand at zero.

For complex values of the argument, the definition becomes ambiguous due to branch points at 0 and Instead of Ei, the following notation is used,

:formula_2

For positive values of &quot;x&quot;, we have 

In general, a branch cut is taken on the negative real axis and &quot;E&quot;1 can be defined by analytic continuation elsewhere on the complex plane.

For positive values of the real part of formula_3, this can be written
:formula_4

The behaviour of &quot;E&quot;1 near the branch cut can be seen by the following relation:

:formula_5

==Properties==
Several properties of the exponential integral below, in certain cases, allow one to avoid its explicit evaluation through the definition above.

===Convergent series===
For real or complex arguments off the negative real axis, formula_6 can be expressed as

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The sum converges for all complex formula_3, and we take the usual value of the complex logarithm having a branch cut along the negative real axis.

This formula can be used to compute formula_10 with floating point operations for real formula_11 between 0 and 2.5. For formula_12, the result is inaccurate due to cancellation.

A faster converging series was found by Ramanujan:

:formula_13

===Asymptotic (divergent) series===
Unfortunately, the convergence of the series above is slow for arguments of larger modulus. For example, more than 40 terms are required to get an answer correct to three significant figures for formula_14. However, for positive values of x, there is a divergent series approximation that can be obtained by integrating formula_15 by parts:
: formula_16
The relative error of the approximation above is plotted on the figure to the right for various values of formula_17, the number of terms in the truncated sum (formula_18 in red, formula_19 in pink).

==== Asymptotics beyond all orders ====
Using integration by parts, we can obtain an explicit formulaformula_20For any fixed formula_3, the absolute value of the error term formula_22 decreases, then increases. The minimum occurs at formula_23, at which point formula_24. This bound is said to be &quot;asymptotics beyond all orders&quot;.

===Exponential and logarithmic behavior: bracketing===
From the two series suggested in previous subsections, it follows that formula_25 behaves like a negative exponential for large values of the argument and like a logarithm for small values. For positive real values of the argument, formula_25 can be bracketed by elementary functions as follows:
:formula_27

The left-hand side of this inequality is shown in the graph to the left in blue; the central part formula_10 is shown in black and the right-hand side is shown in red.

===Definition by Ein===

Both formula_29 and formula_25 can be written more simply using the entire function formula_31 defined as
:formula_32
(note that this is just the alternating series in the above definition of formula_25). Then we have
:formula_34
:formula_35
The function formula_31 is related to the exponential generating function of the harmonic numbers:
:formula_37

:formula_38
is usually solved by the confluent hypergeometric functions formula_39 and formula_40 But when formula_41 and formula_42 that is,
:formula_43
we have
:formula_44
for all &quot;z&quot;. A second solution is then given by E1(−&quot;z&quot;). In fact,
:formula_45
with the derivative evaluated at formula_46 Another connexion with the confluent hypergeometric functions is that &quot;E1&quot; is an exponential times the function &quot;U&quot;(1,1,&quot;z&quot;):
:formula_47

The exponential integral is closely related to the logarithmic integral function li(&quot;x&quot;) by the formula
:formula_48
for non-zero real values of formula_49.

===Generalization===
The exponential integral may also be generalized to

:formula_50

which can be written as a special case of the upper incomplete gamma function:

: formula_51

The generalized form is sometimes called the Misra function formula_52, defined as

:formula_53

Many properties of this generalized form can be found in the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.

Including a logarithm defines the generalized integro-exponential function
:formula_54

===Derivatives===

The derivatives of the generalised functions formula_55 can be calculated by means of the formula 
:formula_56
Note that the function formula_57 is easy to evaluate (making this recursion useful), since it is just formula_58.

===Exponential integral of imaginary argument===

If formula_3 is imaginary, it has a nonnegative real part, so we can use the formula
:formula_60
to get a relation with the trigonometric integrals formula_61 and formula_62:
:formula_63
The real and imaginary parts of formula_64 are plotted in the figure to the right with black and red curves.

=== Approximations ===
There have been a number of approximations for the exponential integral function. These include:

* The Swamee and Ohija approximation formula_65 where formula_66 
* The Allen and Hastings approximation formula_67 where formula_68
* The continued fraction expansion formula_69
* The approximation of Barry &quot;et al.&quot; formula_70 where: formula_71 with formula_8 being the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

== Inverse function of the Exponential Integral ==
We can express the Inverse function of the exponential integral in power series form:

: formula_73

where formula_74 is the Ramanujan–Soldner constant and formula_75 is polynomial sequence defined by the following recurrence relation:

: formula_76

For formula_77, formula_78 and we have the formula :

: formula_79

<text>Beovoz (, stylized as – BEOVOZ) was a commuter rail that provided mass-transit service within the Belgrade metropolitan area. The main usage of system was to connect the suburbs with downtown Belgrade. Beovoz was operated by Serbian Railways.

The Belgrade suburban railway system connects the suburbs and nearby cities to the west, north and south of the city.

==History==

The reconstruction of the Belgrade railway junction began in 1971, since 1977 the construction of a central section about 10 km long, with several tunnels on it, began. Since 1984, traffic began along the route Batajnica - Beograd Main Station, and the official opening took place in 1992, when tunneling under the city center was completed and electric trains were launched in three directions: Batajnica in the west, Pančevo in the north and Resnik in the south of Belgrade. The operational control center is located at the Belgrade Center station, also known as Prokop. The construction of this station, which should have received not only suburban, but also intercity and international passenger trains, has not yet been completed.

On July 7, 1995, 2 underground stations were opened in the longest tunnel leading to the Pančevo Bridge.

The lines operate electric trains of the machine-building plant Rīgas Vagonbūves Rūpnīca ER31 and ER35, with three-door cars and 1435 mm gauge bogies. Since 2010, modern trains have been purchased to replace worn-out Riga trains.

For a long time Beovoz intervals were significant, from half an hour on the main line Pančevo bridge - Batajnica, to just a few trains per day on peripheral sections. The system was not popular with residents of the city, but was in demand by residents of the suburbs for trips to Belgrade. In 2007, Beovoz carried about 4.5 million passengers.

In 2010, the section Pančevo bridge - New Belgrade was reconstructed and included in the new system of urban electric trains, called the BG Voz. An important difference of the new system is the tact timetable for the movement of electric trains: at rush hour, the intervals are exactly 15 minutes, the rest of the time - half an hour. In 2011, the tracks were reconstructed to Batajnica station and this section was also included in the new system.

==Ridership==

Beovoz handled 6,182,000 passengers in 2006.

==Service area==
There were four lines in the Belgrade underground railway network:

* Inđija - Novi Beograd - Vukov Spomenik - Pančevo Vojlovica
* Velika Plana - Rakovica - Novi Beograd - Zemun - Inđija
* Mladenovac - Ripanj - Rakovica - Vukov Spomenik - Pančevo Vojlovica
* Valjevo - Rakovica - Vukov Spomenik - Pančevo Vojlovica

Most stations were above ground. Vukov Spomenik and Karađorđev Park—the two underground stations of the Beovoz system—are located in downtown Belgrade.

==Closure==

Following introduction of BG Voz back in 2010, many vehicles used in Beovoz were rerouted towards new system. After the beginning of reconstruction of Pančevo bridge in 2013, some of the main lines (Belgrade-Pančevo and Valjevo-Pančevo) were abolished, while others were included in Serbian railways regional system. After this, Beovoz became officially defunct.

== The rolling stock ==
The line operates nine ER31 4-car electric trains manufactured by the Rīgas Vagonbūves Rūpnīca with an upper current collection and three doors on the sides of the cars, repaired at the expense of the city specifically for intracity transportation.

<doc id="648619" wikidata="Q7618124" url="?curid=648619" title="Stockline Plastics factory explosion">
<text>On 11 May 2004, the ICL Plastics factory (commonly referred to as Stockline Plastics factory), in the Woodside district of Maryhill, Glasgow in western Scotland, exploded. Nine people were killed, including two company directors, and 33 injured, 15 seriously. The four-storey building was largely destroyed.

==Response==
Approximately 100 people worked in the four-storey building. At midday BST (11:00 UTC), an explosion occurred and the building collapsed instantly.

The first service to attend were a Patient Transport Ambulance crew who took the decision to divert straight to the scene because they were so close at the time of the explosion. This initial crew saved dozens of lives by taking control of the evacuation and pulling the injured to safety. Around a dozen were trapped in the rubble. Fire crews used specialist search-and-rescue equipment, including sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors (which detect the respired carbon dioxide of trapped persons), thermal-imaging equipment, and fibre-optic cameras to search for people trapped in the collapsed building. Some trapped workers were able to make themselves heard by shouting, or by using their mobile phones. Fire and Ambulance crews pulled seven people alive from the rubble on 11 May. The search through the factory&#x27;s ruins continued for the following three days.

Up to 300 firefighters and paramedics were present at the scene and were supported by, the crew of a Sea King rescue helicopter from RAF Leconfield, North Yorkshire, and a sniffer dog team from RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. The volunteer group International Rescue Corps, who specialise in travelling to the site of earthquakes and helping locate survivors, sent eleven of its Scottish members to the scene.

The injured were taken for treatment to five hospitals in Glasgow; the most patients were taken to Stobhill Hospital, Western Infirmary and Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and the remaining were treated at Southern General and Victoria Infirmary. Seven people were declared dead at the scene, and two died in Western Infirmary. One firefighter was taken to hospital after being overcome by fumes, and several were stricken by heat exhaustion while labouring in the hot and humid conditions. 

By the end of the second day, seven deaths had been declared. After the fourth day, Strathclyde Police had named the deceased as Annette Doyle (32), Peter Ferguson (52), Thomas McAulay (41), Tracey McErlane (27), Ann Trench (34), company directors Stewart McColl (60) and Margaret Brownlie (49), Kenneth Ronald Murray, (45), and Timothy Smith (31). With the recovery of Mr. Smith&#x27;s body from the site on 14 May, Strathclyde Fire Brigade announced that they believed no hope of recovering live victims remained.

==Cause==
Ten weeks after the explosion, the site was returned to the owners, after tonnes of debris were removed from the site for detailed examination.

The cause of the explosion was initially unknown. Some press coverage reported eyewitness accounts of gas industrial ovens in the coating department exploding. This has since been shown as unlikely as the gas ovens used on site have been found intact.

Another theory investigated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) was that there was no explosion. An article in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper of 5 October 2004 stated that the HSE was investigating the possibility that heavy machinery and pallets kept on the upper floors caused the floor to collapse, bringing the rest of the building down with it.

Other theories included a dust explosion and a build-up of methane beneath the building.

However the final report of the HSE indicated that the explosion was due to an ignition of gas released by a leak in a pressurised petroleum gas pipe.

The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tank and pipes that had been installed beneath the factory in the late 1960s had corroded, allowing the gas to escape.

==Confusion over name==

Although regularly referred to as the &quot;Stockline Plastics factory&quot;, largely due to the signage around the building (the &quot;name over the door&quot;), the factory was owned by ICL Plastics and much of the work that took place there was for ICL Tech (part of the same group of companies). The offices on the floors above were used by ICL Plastics, ICL Tech (formerly ICL Technical Plastics), and Stockline Plastics.

Stockline Plastics is a distribution company that is part of the same group of companies, and did not operate the factory.

==Aftermath==

The Grovepark Fund, established to help the families of those killed and injured in the blast, received a boost when the departing Celtic F.C. star, Henrik Larsson, announced that the shirt he wore in his farewell match against Seville on Tuesday would be auctioned in aid of the appeal. It was expected to attract bids of up to £10,000. It eventually sold for £1400. 

A memorial service took place in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 4 July 2004. Another was held at Community Central Hall on 11 May 2005, one year on from the tragic event.

==Prosecution==

The Crown Office decided on 17 February to prosecute ICL Plastics Limited and ICL Tech Limited under the Health &amp; Safety at Work Act following a report conducted by the Glasgow Procurator Fiscal and HSE.

The company was accused of:
* Failing to maintain pipes carrying hazardous gas;
* Failure to ensure the safety of staff and visitors; and
* Failing to carry out suitable and sufficient risk assessments.

The original hearing date of 12 December 2006 was postponed as &quot;The timescale that the defence solicitors have been afforded for their preparation of the case has been significantly less [than the Procurator Fiscal&#x27;s]&quot;.

The trial, which began on 13 August 2007, concluded on 17 August 2007, with the operators ICL Tech Ltd and ICL Plastics admitting to four charges in court. 

On 28 August 2007 a fine of £200,000 was imposed on each of the two companies responsible (ICL Plastics Limited and ICL Tech Limited).

==Public Inquiry==

The ICL Inquiry took place in Maryhill Community Central Hall. It occurred after the criminal proceedings were concluded.

In December 2007, Lord Gill, Lord Justice Clerk was announced as Chair of the inquiry.
 The inquiry started on 2 July 2008, after extensive refurbishment work was carried out on behalf of the Scottish Courts Service to make the venue suitable for the public inquiry. The Crown, the victims&#x27; families, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and ICL are all represented. The inquiry examined over 20,000 pages of evidence and took place in two phases. The first was a factual enquiry into what occurred. The second stage, to look at causes and reasons, began in October 2008. The inquiry was chaired by Lord Gill. Roy Martin Q.C., a former Dean of the faculty of Advocates, was lead counsel for the inquiry.

In July 2009, Lord Gill&#x27;s Report was published. His inquiry cost £1.9 million and was published 13 months after his appointment. It was described favourably in 2024 by the &quot;Times&quot; as &quot;short, sharp and hard-hitting&quot; in contrast to many subsequent inquiries. In Appendix 4 of the Report Lord Gill set out the chronological process operated by him. In the Preface he stated he did this to assist other inquiries in the future.

As well as being critical of the companies involved, it noted failings by the Health &amp; Safety Executive&#x27;s supervision and inspection regime. The Report contained various recommendations relating to proper safety protocols concerning the storage and use of liquid petroleum gas.

==Memorial==
In May 2007, a memorial garden was unveiled.

<text>Swatara Creek (nicknamed the Swatty) is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in east-central Pennsylvania in the United States. It rises in the Appalachian Mountains in central Schuylkill County and passes through northwest Lebanon County before draining into the Susquehanna at Middletown in Dauphin County.

The name &quot;Swatara&quot; is said to derive from a Susquehannock word, &quot;Swahadowry&quot; or &quot;Schaha-dawa&quot;, which means &quot;where we feed on eels&quot;. Ancient Native Americans built dozens of eel-weirs, V-shaped rock barriers designed to funnel eels to facilitate capture, on the Susquehanna and its tributaries.

== Geography ==
Swatara Creek rises in the Appalachian Mountains in central Schuylkill County, on Broad Mountain north of the Sharp Mountain ridge, approximately west of Minersville. It flows southwest in a winding course, passing south of Tremont, then cutting south through the ridges of Sharp Mountain and Second Mountain. It passes through Swatara State Park then turns south to pass through Swatara Gap in the Blue Mountain ridge northwest of Lebanon. After emerging from the ridge the creek flows southwest, north of Hershey, past Hummelstown, and joins the Susquehanna at Royalton, in Middletown. It receives Quittapahilla Creek from the east north of Palmyra.

== History ==

The creek was a significant transportation route in the colonial period of North America up through the late 19th century. A canal linking the Susquehanna and Delaware valleys in southeastern Pennsylvania was first proposed in 1690 by William Penn, the founder of the Pennsylvania Colony. Nearly a century passed before a route for the canal was surveyed by David Rittenhouse and William Smith between 1762 and 1770, the first canal ever surveyed in the United States. Spurred by the 1791 discovery of anthracite in the upper Susquehanna Valley, the Pennsylvania General Assembly chartered two companies to undertake the project: the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company and the Delaware and Schuylkill Navigation Company. At the time of the initial construction in 1792, Philadelphia was involved in an intense rivalry with Baltimore, Maryland, for supremacy as a shipping port. The canal was backed by Philadelphia businessmen as a means to divert commercial traffic from following the Susquehanna downriver to the Chesapeake Bay, its more natural destination. Although the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company project failed for lack of funds, the project was restarted and ultimately completed by its successor company, the Union Canal in 1828.

From west to east, the route of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company canal in 1792 was to follow Swatara Creek upstream from Middletown to Quittapahilla Creek, which it then followed upstream past Lebanon and Myerstown to its headwaters. It then crossed overland to Clarks Run at the headwaters of Tulpehocken Creek, following Tulpehocken Creek downstream to Reading on the Schuylkill River. It was to follow the Schuylkill downriver to the Delaware River at Philadelphia. The route of the Union Canal followed the same route up Swatara Creek and continued up the creek to Union Water Works. The canal then went up Clarks Run to the summit and thence by a tunnel over to Lebanon. The upper course above Union Water Works into the mountains provided the route of a feeder to the main canal, as well as providing a route to ship anthracite from the mountains to Philadelphia.

On September 8, 2011, the creek reached a record height of near Hershey, following devastating rains from Tropical Storm Lee and remnants of Hurricane Irene, the highest since measurements began in 1975. Farther upstream at the Harpers Tavern gauge, was recorded, making it the worst flooding since 1889. The flooding caused thousands of people to be evacuated from their homes throughout central Pennsylvania, and at least one death.

Several covered bridges once crossed Swatara Creek, including the Fiddler&#x27;s Elbow Covered Bridge, built 1862, near Hummelstown and Clifton Covered Bridge, built 1870, near Middletown, both destroyed by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The Sand Beach Covered Bridge burned down in 1966 by arson.

== Recreation ==

Today, Swatara Creek is part of a national and statewide water trail system, providing outdoor recreation for families canoeing and kayaking a segment that connects to the Susquehanna River and Captain John Smith water trails.

== Drinking water ==
Three water companies — Suez Water Pennsylvania, American Water, and the Lebanon Water Authority — draw drinking water for hundreds of thousands of residents of the Swatara watershed.

== Tributaries ==
* Iron Run
* Beaver Creek
* Spring Creek
* Manada Creek
* Quittapahilla Creek
* Brandywine Creek
* Bow Creek
* Indiantown Run
* Little Swatara Creek
* Lower Little Swatara Creek
* Upper Little Swatara Creek

== Ships ==
Two ships in the United States Navy have been named USS &quot;Swatara&quot; after the creek:
* The first USS &quot;Swatara&quot; (1865) was a wooden, screw sloop, launched in 1865 and dismantled in 1872 to become the second ship of this name.
* The second USS &quot;Swatara&quot; (1873) was a screw sloop, launched in 1873 and decommissioned in 1891.

<text>Seychellois Creole (), also known as Kreol, Seselwa Creole French, and Seselwa Creole is the French-based creole language spoken by the Seychelles Creole people of the Seychelles. It is one of the national languages of the Seychelles.

== History ==
The Seychelles were first settled in 1770, by French settlers from the island of Mauritius. The islands population was mostly made up of slaves with a few whites and free blacks. Over time the Mauritian creole that was spoken by the slave population diverged enough from Mauritian Creole to be considered its own creole separate from Mauritian Creole. It further diverged after the freeing of Seychelles slaves in 1835 and the subsequent influx of Bantu peoples from East Africa to the islands.

49 fables of La Fontaine were adapted to the dialect around 1900 by Rodolphine Young (1860–1932) but these remained unpublished until 1983.

== Status ==
The Seychelles gained independence in 1976 and since 1978 Seychellois Creole has been one of the country&#x27;s three official languages. It is currently the native language of over 99% of the country&#x27;s population. Seychellois Creole is the primary language of music, literature, politics, public usage, and mass media in the Seychelles. Though Seychellois literature has been increasingly replaced by English literature.

While Seychellois laws are written in English, the working language of the National Assembly is Creole and the verbatim record of its meetings provides an extensive corpus for its contemporary use in a formal setting.

On June 27th 2024 Google announced it would be adding Seychellois Creole to Google Translate. Later Seychellois Creole was added under the name Seselwa Creole French.

== Morphology and syntax ==
Seychellois Creole follows in subject verb object word order.

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns in Seychellois Creole fall into three categories: dependent subject, independent subject, and adnominal possessive, with there being no gender distinctions. dependent pronouns can only be subjects not objects but independent pronouns can be both.
=== Verbs ===
Verbs in Seychellois Creole take one of two forms, long and short. Short verbs are used when the verb is directly followed by a noun or when an adverb is present and the long verbs being used otherwise.

Causative voice are marked by the word &quot;fer&quot; (make) while Reflexive voice is marked with either the express lack of a marking; or the words &quot;li, mekor,&quot; and &quot;limenm&quot;.

== Dialects ==
There is some variation in the language spoken in the Seychelles based on geography with limited differences in morphosyntax and lexicon, but not enough to speak of separate dialects. The only distinct non-standard dialect of Seychellois Creole is Chagossian Creole spoken by Chagossians in the United Kingdom, Mauritius, and the Seychelles.

== Lexicon ==
In several Seychellois Creole words derived from French, the French definite article (&quot;le&quot;, &quot;la&quot; and &quot;les&quot;) has become part of the word; for example, &#x27;future&#x27; is &quot;lavenir&quot; (French &quot;l&#x27;avenir&quot;). The possessive is the same as the pronoun, so that &#x27;our future&#x27; is &quot;nou lavenir&quot;. Similarly in the plural, &quot;les Îles Éloignées Seychelles&quot; in French (&#x27;the Outer Seychelles Islands&#x27;) has become &quot;Zil Elwanyen Sesel&quot; in Creole. Note the &quot;z&quot; in &quot;Zil&quot;, as, in French, &quot;les Îles&quot; is pronounced .
=== Loanwords ===

Among loanwords in Seychellois Creole they have different frequencies words for the modern world, warfare/hunting, food and drink, animals, and the home show loanword rates over 10 percent. while words relating to cognition, emotions, social and political relationships, and the physical world show no loanwords.

== Samples ==
(Lord&#x27;s Prayer)

<doc id="648640" wikidata="Q1243018" url="?curid=648640" title="Coinfection">
<text>Coinfection is the simultaneous infection of a host by multiple pathogen species. In virology, coinfection includes simultaneous infection of a single cell by two or more virus particles. An example is the coinfection of liver cells with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus, which can arise incrementally by initial infection followed by superinfection.

Global prevalence or incidence of coinfection among humans is unknown, but it is thought to be commonplace, sometimes more common than single infection. Coinfection with helminths affects around 800 million people worldwide.

Coinfection is of particular human health importance because pathogen species can interact within the host. The net effect of coinfection on human health is thought to be negative. Interactions can have either positive or negative effects on other parasites. Under positive parasite interactions, disease transmission and progression are enhanced and this is also known as syndemism. Negative parasite interactions include microbial interference when one bacterial species suppresses the virulence or colonisation of other bacteria, such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; suppressing pathogenic &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; colony formation. The general patterns of ecological interactions between parasite species are unknown, even among common coinfections such as those between sexually transmitted infections. However, network analysis of a food web of coinfection in humans suggests that there is greater potential for interactions via shared food sources than via the immune system.

A globally common coinfection involves tuberculosis and HIV. In some countries, up to 80% of tuberculosis patients are also HIV-positive. The potential for dynamics of these two infectious diseases to be linked has been known for decades. Other common examples of coinfections are AIDS, which involves coinfection of end-stage HIV with opportunistic parasites and polymicrobial infections like Lyme disease with other diseases. Coinfections sometimes can epitomize a zero sum game of bodily resources, and precise viral quantitation demonstrates children co-infected with rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus or parainfluenza virus have lower nasal viral loads than those with rhinovirus alone.

==Poliovirus==

Poliovirus is a positive single-stranded RNA virus in the family &quot;Picornaviridae&quot;. Coinfections appear to be common and several pathways have been identified for transmitting multiple virions to a single host cell. These include transmission by virion aggregates, transmission of viral genomes within membrane vesicles, and transmission by bacteria bound by several viral particles. 

Drake demonstrated that poliovirus is able to undergo multiplicity reactivation. That is, when polioviruses were irradiated with UV light and allowed to undergo multiple infections of host cells, viable progeny could be formed even at UV doses that inactivated the virus in single infections. Poliovirus can undergo genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell. Kirkegaard and Baltimore presented evidence that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) catalyzes recombination by a copy choice mechanism in which the RdRP switches between (+)ssRNA templates during negative strand synthesis. Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptive mechanism for transmitting an undamaged genome to virus progeny.

==Examples==
* Anaplasmosis
* Bacteriophage coinfection
* GB virus C
* HIV-HCV coinfection
* HIV-TB coinfection (enhances TB transmission and lethality)
* Hepatitis D
* Hookworm-malaria coinfection
* &quot;Mansonella perstans&quot;
* Trichuriasis
* Chikungunya and Dengue coinfection
* Dengue and HIV coinfection (suppresses HIV)
* Chagas and HIV coinfection
* Most sexually transmitted diseases and HIV (enhance HIV transmission)
* Some COVID-19 patients, or those who were ill with other coronaviruses, can be co-infected with seasonal influenza (flu) viral strains, certain viral strains that cause the common cold, or can be co-infected with bronchitis or pneumonia from another bacterial or viral micro-organism. Even more dangerous, some of them could already have conditions like tuberculosis or active AIDS that make patients very vulnerable.

<text>Patricia Lynn Wetterling (born November 2, 1949) is an American advocate of children&#x27;s safety and chair of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Her advocacy particularly focuses on protecting children from abduction and abuse. She has become one of the most vocal critics of current sex offender registry laws, painting them as overly broad and unnecessarily causing tremendous harm to many. Her advocacy began after her son Jacob was abducted in 1989 and culminated in passage of the federal Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act. She was a candidate for the Minnesota Sixth District seat in the United States House of Representatives as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party candidate in 2004 and 2006, losing to Republicans Mark Kennedy and Michele Bachmann respectively. In September 2016, the remains of her son Jacob were discovered and positively identified.

==Biography==
Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Wetterling grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota and later moved to St. Joseph, where she raised four children (Amy, Jacob, Trevor and Carmen) with her husband Jerry. On October 22, 1989, their son Jacob, then 11 years old, was abducted at gunpoint by a masked man. An extensive search was carried out, but Jacob and the abductor were not found. Jacob&#x27;s remains were found on September 1, 2016, 27 years after the abduction. Four months after the abduction, the Wetterlings founded the Jacob Wetterling Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to child safety education. Wetterling sent a scathing letter to then Attorney General Alberto Gonzales decrying the dilution of sex offender registration laws and demanding that Congress and the Justice Department fix the flaws that their overzealousness caused. On June 18, 2007, Wetterling was interviewed on air by Minnesota Public Radio and discussed &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; offenders (cases where both parties are teenagers and were dating or were willing participants in the sex). Wetterling has found common ground with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and joined them in declaring the Adam Walsh Act unconstitutional and contrary to public safety. On September 14, 2007, Wetterling reiterated her perception of the harm that current sex offender laws are causing.

==Political career==
In the 2004 race for U.S. Representative from Minnesota&#x27;s 6th District she challenged incumbent Republican Mark Kennedy. Wetterling decided to enter the race after Stillwater lawyer Janet Robert withdrew. Wetterling received a $1,000 campaign contribution donation from U.S. Senate candidate Barack Obama, one of only 3 political contributions listed for Obama that year. Kennedy won the election with 54% of the vote to Wetterling&#x27;s 46%.

Wetterling then entered the race for Mark Dayton&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat in 2006 when Dayton announced he would not seek reelection. Wetterling withdrew from the race on January 20, 2006, and endorsed Hennepin County Attorney Amy Klobuchar of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, who won the election.

After leaving the Senate race, Wetterling was publicly asked by Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Mike Hatch to run with him as Lieutenant Governor. Wetterling declined Hatch&#x27;s offer. On February 3, 2006, Wetterling announced that she would once again run for Congress in Minnesota&#x27;s Sixth Congressional District. Wetterling&#x27;s opponent for the DFL nomination was Elwyn Tinklenberg, former mayor of Blaine, Minnesota. A third DFL candidate, Scott Mortensen, dropped out early on.

On May 13, 2006, Wetterling won the DFL endorsement to face Republican state senator Michele Bachmann for the U.S. House seat. Wetterling lost the general election to Bachmann, 50% to 42%.
==Son&#x27;s abduction==
In 1999, for the 10th anniversary of Jacob&#x27;s abduction, Patty Wetterling decided to write an open letter to the abductor. Minnesota newspapers agreed to print it for her. Wetterling consulted the FBI for advice on how to word the letter. In the letter, Wetterling asks the abductor if Jacob is still with him. She offers compassion for the abductor, and says that all little boys, including the abductor when he was one, deserve a happy childhood. She tells him she&#x27;s sorry if he did not have one, that she does not see him as an ugly, dirty old man, and that she hopes that if he ever goes fishing and catches something he cooks it for Jacob. She writes that she and her family are looking for answers, that only he can answer them, and that she wants to know what became of Jacob after the kidnapping. The letter generated some tips, but nothing substantial.

Also in early 2004, news reports circulated that new evidence was being considered in the abduction of her son. News outlets in the Twin Cities indicated that another boy had been assaulted not long before Jacob disappeared. Police were also ruling out the long-held belief that the abductor had gotten away in a car.

On September 1, 2016, a person of interest named in the investigation reportedly decided to cooperate with authorities and led investigators to human remains. On September 3, Wetterling told television station KARE, a local NBC affiliate, that the remains found were indeed those of Jacob&#x27;s. She said, &quot;All I can confirm is that Jacob has been found and our hearts are broken. I am not responding to any media yet as I have no words.&quot;

==Philanthropy==

Wetterling is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), a global nonprofit organization that combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction.

<doc id="648642" wikidata="Q1563808" url="?curid=648642" title="Superinfection">
<text>A superinfection is a second infection superimposed on an earlier one, especially by a different microbial agent of exogenous or endogenous origin, that is resistant to the treatment being used against the first infection. Examples of this in bacteriology are the overgrowth of endogenous &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; that occurs following treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and pneumonia or sepsis from &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; in some immunocompromised patients.

In virology, the definition is slightly different. Superinfection is the process by which a cell that has previously been infected by one virus gets co-infected with a different strain of the virus, or another virus, at a later point in time. In some cases viral superinfections may be resistant to the antiviral drug or drugs that were being used to treat the original infection. Viral superinfections may also be less susceptible to the host&#x27;s immune response. In Zika virus infection, there is some evidence that primary infection of another &quot;Flavivirus&quot;, Binjari virus, results in the direct inhibition of a secondary infection of Zika virus in mosquito cells. Recent metagenomic analyses have demonstrated that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be associated with superinfection and colonization of other pathogens, such as rhinovirus species and &quot;Moraxella spp.&quot;

In parasitology, superinfection is reinfection of the same genus of parasite, as a person infected by &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot; again infected by &quot;Fasciola gigantica&quot;.

<text>Livarot is a French cheese of the Normandy region, originating in the commune of Livarot, and protected by an &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) since 1975.

It is a soft, pungent, washed rind cheese made from Normande cow&#x27;s milk. The normal weight for a round of Livarot is 450 grams, though it also comes in other weights. It is sold in cylindrical form with the orangish rind wrapped in three to five rings of dried reedmace (&quot;Typha latifolia&quot;). For this reason, it has been referred to as &quot;colonel&quot;, as the rings of dried bullrush resemble the stripes on a colonel&#x27;s uniform. Sometimes green paper is also used. Its orange colour comes from different sources depending on the manufacturer, but is often annatto. The bacterium &quot;Brevibacterium linens&quot; is employed in fermentation. Production in 1998 was 1,101 tonnes, down 12.2% since 1996. Only 12% of Livarot are made from raw, unpasteurised milk. Its period of optimal tasting is spread out from May to September after a refining from six to eight weeks, but it is also excellent from March to December.

<text>Livarot () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Livarot-Pays-d&#x27;Auge.

The population is 2,045 inhabitants (in 2022) and the name of its inhabitants is &quot;Livarotais&quot;.

The town is home to many companies of renown such as the Georges Leroy factory, Graindorge cheese manufacturing which produces Livarot, among others. The commune gave its name to its cheese; Livarot cheese. The La Fermière (CCLF) calvados cider is also produced in the commune.

==Geography==
Livarot is situated at the junction of the D4 and D579 roads. The nearest city is Caen, approximately to the north-west.

==Toponymy==
The place is attested late in the form &quot;Livarrot&quot; in 1155, and &quot;Livar(r)ou&quot; in 1156 or 1157.

The etymological explanation of this place name has no unanimity among toponymists:

*Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, based on a false attestation of &quot;Livaron&quot; from 1137 (form and date wrong), described it as &quot;obscure&quot;, while evoking a derivision of &quot;ivos&quot;, an assumed Gallic word designating if, and declaring it unlikely. They perhaps resume in these previous assumptions. In reality, the term &quot;*ivos&quot; or &quot;*īvos&quot; is not attested and should include an asterisk.
*Ernest Nègre, reasoning from this same erroneous form, considered that it might be from the Germanic name &quot;Liubwar&quot;, which is followed by the suffix &quot;-o /-onem&quot; and that the final would be modified by attraction of names in &quot;-ot&quot;. However, François de Beaurepaire notes that a Germanic name is never used with this suffix. 
*Dominique Fournier refuted &quot;Livaron&quot; (cacography attributed to Albert Dauzat, and badly dated) and based it on the actual form &quot;Livar(r)ou&quot;, stemming from the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Robert of Torigni, to advance the hypothesis of a Gallo-Roman person named &quot;Libarius&quot; followed by the suffix of Gallic origin &quot;-avo&quot; which explains most of the words ending in &quot;-ou&quot; of Normandy.

==History==
===Battle of Normandy===
On 17 July 1944, the pharmacist and Mayor of Livarot brought first aid to Rommel following the strafing of his car by an Allied aircraft, not far away, between the villages of Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery and Vimoutiers. He was then evacuated, the same day, to the German military hospital in Bernay.

Livarot was liberated on 19 August. Following Operation Paddle, the British 7th Armoured Division was on the banks of the . The division then faced a strong resistance by the 272nd Division of the German infantry, but also suffered losses to friendly fire from Allied aircraft. On 19 August, British artillery heavily bombed the area. The British arrived to seize a bridge, which hadn&#x27;t been destroyed, across the river to Saint-Michel-de-Livet, north of Livarot. The French Resistance then learned that the Germans had abandoned Livarot and that the first British soldiers had entered the same day.

==Heraldry==
==Politics and administration==
The municipal council is composed of 23 members, including the mayor and six assistants.

==Demographics==
In 2012, the municipality had 2,183 inhabitants. Since 2004, censuses in municipalities of less than 10,000 inhabitants are held every five years (in 2008, 2013, 2018, etc. for Livarot) and legal municipal population are estimations in other years. Livarot counted 2,654 inhabitants in 1975.

<text>Marilyn Mazur (born January 18, 1955) is an American-born Danish percussionist. Since 1975, she has worked as a percussionist with various groups, among them Six Winds with Alex Riel. Mazur is primarily an autodidact, but she has a degree in percussion from the Royal Danish Academy of Music.

==Musical life==
Mazur was born in New York City in 1955, from Polish and African-American parents, who moved with her to Denmark at age 6. She learned to play the piano, but when she was 19, she took up drumming, inspired by Al Foster, Airto Moreira, and Alex Riel. She started her first band in 1973, &quot;Zirenes&quot;. In 1978, she formed &quot;Primi&quot;, an all-woman theatre band. In 1985, she was asked to participate in the Palle Mikkelborg project that would become the Miles Davis album &quot;Aura&quot;, and soon after she went on the road with Miles Davis. Afterward, she played with Gil Evans, Wayne Shorter, Jan Garbarek, and Makiko Hirabayashi.

Her all-Scandinavian band Shamania consists of avant-garde female musicians.

The U.S. magazine &quot;Down Beat&quot;, in 1989, 1990, 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2002 selected Mazur as a &quot;percussion-talent deserving wider recognition&quot;. In 2001, she was awarded the Jazzpar Prize, the world&#x27;s largest international jazz prize.

<text>Nieuwpoort is a tiny city in the Netherlands in the municipality of Molenlanden. The place was given city rights in 1283.

In 2001, the city of Nieuwpoort had 619 inhabitants. The built-up area of the city was 0.092 km², and contained 230 residences.
The statistical area &quot;Nieuwpoort&quot;, which also can include the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 1370 (2006).

== History ==

In the 13th century, the current location of the Nieuwpoort fortress was created by Lord Van Liesveld and Lord Van Langerack. The two lords wanted a settlement and in 1270, they both gave some of their property to make this happen. In 1283, the fortress was given town privileges.

After a turbulent beginning, with many sieges and devastation, more peaceful times eventually arrived in the 17th century. The city ramparts saved the city from floods in 1809 and 1820. Due to an economical crisis in the 1930s and World War II, the town decayed. In 1970, the Provincial States of South Holland initiated a reconstruction and restoration of the fortress and the town. This work was finished in 1998.

Nieuwpoort was a separate municipality until 1986, when it became part of Liesveld, and then became part of Molenwaard in 2013.

<doc id="648679" wikidata="Q168431" url="?curid=648679" title="Ignazio Silone">
<text>Secondino Tranquilli (1 May 1900 – 22 August 1978), best known by the pseudonym Ignazio Silone (, ), was an Italian politician, novelist, essayist, playwright, and short-story writer, world-famous during World War II for his powerful anti-fascist novels. Considered among the most well-known and read Italian intellectuals in Europe and in the world, his most famous novel, &quot;Fontamara&quot;, became emblematic for its denunciation of the condition of poverty, injustice, and social oppression of the lower classes, has been translated into numerous languages. From 1946 to 1963, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

For many years an anti-fascist exile abroad, Silone participated actively and in various phases of Italian politics, animating the cultural life of the country in the post-war period. He was among the founders of the Italy&#x27;s Communist party in 1921; he was later expelled for his dissidence with the Stalinist party line, and moved to democratic socialist positions. The break with the Italian Communist Party in the years after World War II led him to be often opposed by Italian critics and rehabilitated belatedly despite a controversy about his relations with the Italian fascist secret police, while for all his career he was particularly appreciated abroad.

== Early life and education ==
Silone was born in a rural family, in the town of Pescina, near L&#x27;Aquila, in the Abruzzo region. His father, Paolo Tranquilli, died in 1911, and he lost many of his family members, including his mother, Marianna Delli Quadri, in the 1915 Avezzano earthquake. He left his hometown and finished high school.

== Career ==
=== From the PSI to the PCd&#x27;I ===
In 1917, Silone joined the Young Socialists group of the Italian Socialist Party (&quot;Partito Socialista Italiano&quot;, PSI), rising to be their leader. In October 1920, while in Rome, he met Alfonso Leonetti, another socialist Meridionalist, with whom Silone would share, among other things, his opposition to Stalinism. Silone was a founding member of the breakaway Communist Party of Italy (&quot;Partito Comunista d&#x27;Italia&quot;, PCd&#x27;I) in 1921 and became one of its covert leaders during the Italian fascist regime. His brother, Romolo Tranquilli, was arrested in 1928 for being a member of the PCd&#x27;I and died in prison in 1931 as a result of the severe beatings he received.

=== Opposition to Stalinism, return to the PSI, and breakaway socialist activity ===

Silone left Italy in 1927 on a mission to the Soviet Union and settled in Switzerland in 1930. While there, he declared his opposition to Joseph Stalin and the leadership of Comintern; consequently, he was expelled from the PCd&#x27;I, and returned to the PSI. He suffered from tuberculosis and severe clinical depression and spent nearly a year in Swiss clinics; in Switzerland, Aline Valangin helped and played host to him and other migrants. As he recovered, Silone began writing his first novel, &quot;Fontamara&quot;, published in German translation in 1933. The English edition, first published by Penguin Books in September 1934, went through frequent reprintings during the 1930s, with the events of the Spanish Civil War and the escalation towards the outbreak of World War II increasing attention for its subject material.

In the course of World War II, Silone became the leader of a clandestine socialist organization operating from Switzerland to support Italian resistance groups in Nazi Germany-occupied Northern Italy (Italian Social Republic). He also became an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) agent under the pseudonym of &quot;Len&quot;. The United States Army printed unauthorized versions of &quot;Fontamara&quot; and &quot;Bread and Wine&quot; and distributed them to the Italians during the liberation of Italy after 1943. These two books together with &quot;The Seed Beneath the Snow&quot; form the &quot;Abruzzo Trilogy&quot;. Silone returned to Italy only in 1944, and two years later he was elected as a PSI deputy. In 1946, he became a contributor to &quot;Rosso e Nero&quot;, a magazine started and edited by Alberto Giovannini.

In 1948, Silone was a founder of the breakaway Union of Socialists (&quot;Unione dei Socialisti&quot;, UdS), succeeding Ivan Matteo Lombardo as the party&#x27;s leader in June 1949. In December 1949, the UdS was dissolved, and its members (including Silone) joined the Unitary Socialist Party (&quot;Partito Socialista Unitario&quot;, PSU). In 1951, the PSU merged with Giuseppe Saragat&#x27;s Italian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Partito Socialista dei Lavoratori Italiani&quot;, PSLI) to form the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (&quot;Partito Socialista Democratico Italiano&quot;, PSDI). Saragat encouraged Silone to stand for the Senate on the PSDI list in the 1953 Italian general election. As the experience was a failure, he spurned any active participation in Italian politics from then on.

=== Later writing and awards ===
Following his contribution to the anti-communist anthology &quot;The God That Failed&quot; (1949), Silone joined the Congress for Cultural Freedom and edited &quot;Tempo Presente&quot; together with Nicola Chiaromonte. In its first issue, Silone criticized political ideologies for being reduced &quot;to the prerogative of reason of state or of party reason&quot;. In 1967, with the discovery that the journal received secret funds from the United States Central Intelligence Agency, Silone resigned and devoted all his energies to writing novels and autobiographical essays. In 1969, Silone was awarded the Jerusalem Prize, which goes to writers who deal with the theme of individual freedom and society. In 1971, he was awarded the prestigious Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.

== Legacy ==

In Italy, Silone was often opposed by its critics, particularly after his break with the PCI and the post-war years, but was more appreciated abroad; for example, Silone was enjoyed by the likes of Heinrich Böll, Albert Camus, and Thomas Mann while critics, such as Carlo Salinari in &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot;, defined him as a &quot;renegade&quot; and a &quot;failure&quot;. His reputation in Italy improved mainly after his death. In the words of Marco Malvestuto, Silone was &quot;opposed by his former party colleagues, often misunderstood, and never well enough known&quot;. Outside of Italy, he became world-famous for his powerful anti-fascist novels. According to Malvestuto, &quot;Ignazio Silone is best known for his literary production and his narrative novels epics of the Marsican &#x27;bosses&#x27;. Less known is the political thinker Silone, whose contribution, perhaps underestimated by official historiography, brings us into contact with an intellectual who is in some ways original, capable of combining political commitment and critical ability; faith towards humanity and scepticism towards institutions and ideologies; trust in social justice and openness to forms of social coexistence inspired by liberal-federalist models.&quot; Politically, Salone, one of the founders of Italy&#x27;s Communist party, wanted to go beyond orthodox communism through federalism and liberal socialism, had a diatribe with the long-time PCI leader Palmiro Togliatti, spoke of the weakness of democratic institutions, and his meetings with Carlo Rosselli and Giustizia e Libertà members led him to rethink socialism away from Marxism–Leninism. Silone defined himself as a &quot;Christian without church and socialist without party&quot;, and is considered the archetypical Italian anti-fascist.

In the 1990s, Italian historians Dario Biocca and Mauro Canali found documents that implied that Silone had acted as an informant for the Fascist police from 1919 until 1930. It is believed that the reason he broke from the Italian fascist secret police OVRA is that they tortured his brother. The two historians published the results of their research in a work titled &quot;L&#x27;informatore. Silone, i comunisti e la polizia&quot;, which attracted significant attention, as well as controversy and criticism. In 2003, Elizabeth Leake put forward the thesis, based on the work of Biocca and Canali, that Silone would have invented his own image, his identity, and life, accusing him of having been a false-socialist spy for the police and then a false-communist spy for the fascists. In her work, Leake does not accept the thesis according to which Silone, who repented after having acted as a fascist spy within the Communist party, redeemed himself through anti-fascist literary works, and goes further; according to Leake, Silone had always been a traitor after the breakdown of the relationship with the fascist police commissioner Ernesto Belloni, an event that according to Leake &quot;represented, for Silone, the event more significant and dramatic than his expulsion from the Italian Communist Party in 1931 or the death of his brother in 1932&quot;. According to Leake, he decided to reinvent his identity by creating a fictitious Silone through literary works, with which to sanctify and exalt himself, and &quot;with Romolo dead, there was no one left to corroborate or to contradict Silone&#x27;s stories.&quot; Critics of her thesis, such as Maria Moscardelli, negatively summarized Leake&#x27;s thesis as arguing that Silone would be the 20th-century political equivalent of Alessandro Cagliostro. A 2005 biography by Biocca also included documents showing Silone&#x27;s involvement with American intelligence (the OSS) during and after World War II, suggesting that Silone&#x27;s political stands and extensive literary work should be reconsidered in light of a more complex personality and political engagements.

Abroad, Silone remained appreciated, and was defended by the likes of Christopher Hitchens. The original book by Biocca and Canali was strongly criticized by Mimmo Franzinelli, a historian who is considered an expert on the OVRA, as well as by the Nenni Foundation president Giuseppe Tamburrano, who saw him as &quot;a consistently indefatigable enemy of Mussolini&#x27;s regime&quot; in contrast to Biocca and Canali&#x27;s Silone as &quot;the cleverest and most effective informer for the Fascist police&quot;. Biocca and Canali&#x27;s work was also criticized by Indro Montanelli, and in articles and essays that appeared in &quot;La Stampa&quot; and in &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, as well as interviews with the likes of Norberto Bobbio, among others, who argued that the accuses first put forward by Biocca and Canali against Silone were done either in bad faith or in good faith but with mediocre scholarship. Conversely, in the words of Antonio Fadda in 2015, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is much uncertainty anymore about the relationships that Secondino Tranquilli (better known as Ignazio Silone) had with the Italian state police in the early years of the fascist regime. ... It has often been explained that Silone&#x27;s collaboration with Bellomo had a humanitarian purpose. It served to obtain better conditions for his brother Romolo, a member of the party, accused of complicity in a bloody attack in Milan, arrested, and treated harshly during police interrogations. The concern for his brother&#x27;s fate was real and justified. But there were probably other reasons that belong to the domain of psychology rather than that of political analysis. Silone was a complicated man, troubled by doubts, examinations of conscience, introspective analyses, feelings of guilt: qualities and virtues that would have made him a great writer, rather than a political leader.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Silone was married to Darina Laracy (1917–2003), an Irish student of Italian literature and journalist. He died in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1978.

<doc id="648690" wikidata="Q205891" url="?curid=648690" title="'O sole mio">
<text>&quot;&quot; () is a well-known Neapolitan song written in 1898. Its Neapolitan-language lyrics were written by Giovanni Capurro and the music was composed by Eduardo di Capua (1865–1917) and Alfredo Mazzucchi (1878–1972). The title translates literally as &quot;my sun&quot; or &quot;my sunshine&quot;. The lyrics have been translated to other languages.

== Lyrics ==
== Recordings ==

O sole mio&quot; has been performed and covered by many artists, including Luciano Pavarotti, Enrico Caruso, Rosa Ponselle and her sister Carmella, Andrea Bocelli, Beniamino Gigli, Richard Tucker and Mario Lanza. Sergio Franchi recorded this song on his 1962 RCA Victor Red Seal debut album &quot;Romantic Italian Songs.&quot; Luciano Pavarotti won the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance for his rendition of O sole mio&quot;.

== Authorship and copyright ==
For nearly 75 years after its publication, the music of &quot;″O sole mio&quot; had generally been attributed to Eduardo di Capua alone. According to the traditional account, di Capua had composed it in April 1898 in Odessa, while touring with his father&#x27;s band. It has turned out, however, that the melody was an elaboration of one of 23 which di Capua had bought from another musician, Alfredo Mazzucchi, in the preceding year.

In November 1972, shortly after her father&#x27;s death, Mazzucchi&#x27;s daughter lodged a declaration with Italy&#x27;s Office of Literary, Artistic and Scientific Property, which sought to have her father recognised as a co-composer of 18 of di Capua&#x27;s songs, including &quot;″O sole mio&quot;. In October 2002, Maria Alvau, a judge in Turin, upheld the declaration, ruling that Mazzucchi had indeed been a legitimate co-composer of the 18 songs, because they included melodies he had composed and then sold to di Capua in June 1897, with a written authorisation for the latter to make free use of them. At the time of the decision, therefore, the melody of &quot;″O sole mio&quot; had not yet—as had been widely supposed—entered into the public domain in any country that was a party to the Berne Convention during the relevant period. In most countries where copyright in a work lasts for 70 years after any of its authors&#x27; deaths, the melody will remain under copyright until 2042.

== English versions ==

In 1915, Charles W. Harrison recorded the first English translation of O sole mio&quot;. In 1921, William E. Booth-Clibborn wrote lyrics for a hymn using the music, entitled &quot;Down from His Glory.&quot;

In 1949 U.S. singer Tony Martin recorded &quot;There&#x27;s No Tomorrow&quot; with lyrics by Al Hoffman, Leo Corday, and Leon Carr, which used the melody of O sole mio&quot;. About ten years later, while stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army, Elvis Presley heard the recording and put to tape a private version of the song. Upon his discharge, he requested that new lyrics be written especially for him, a job that was undertaken by the songwriting duo of Aaron Schroeder and Wally Gold, with a demo by David Hill. The rewritten version was entitled &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot; and was a worldwide hit for Presley. When performing it in concert in the mid-1970s, Elvis would explain the origin of &quot;It&#x27;s Now Or Never&quot; and have singer Sherrill Nielsen perform a few lines of the original Neapolitan version before commencing with his version.

Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album &quot;101 Gang Songs&quot; (1961). Actor John Schneider also had a hit with it in 1981. It was on the Billboard Pop charts at number 14 and the Country charts at number 4.

== Legacy ==
At the opening ceremony of the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, O sole mio&quot; was played in place of the Italian national anthem, whose sheet music had not been delivered to the band.

A series of television commercials for Cornetto ice cream, broadcast regularly in Britain during the 1980s, used a jingle (&quot;Just One Cornetto ...&quot;) set to the melody of O sole mio&quot;. The jingle was widely reported as having been performed by Renato Pagliari, but after Pagliari&#x27;s death in 2009, his son denied this.

In January 2025 Mark Steyn profiled the song, including its origins, in his Song of the Week series.

The first episode was broadcast on 22 July 2006, and was notable for featuring a live marriage proposal. The second episode was eventually broadcast on 30 December 2006, which focused on a woman called Louise Holliday, desperate to prove to her closest friend, who has been fighting a serious illness – how much she cares about her.

==Cancellation==
The series was cancelled after airing only one episode, as a result of poor ratings – 1.7 million saw the programme in its Saturday night prime time slot.

With low ratings, ITV decided to replace the following week&#x27;s episode, 29 July 2006, with a repeat of outtakes show &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot;.

<doc id="648697" wikidata="Q3648879" url="?curid=648697" title="CPU-bound">
<text>In computer science, a task, job or process is said to be CPU-bound (or compute-bound) when the time it takes for it to complete is determined principally by the speed of the central processor. The term can also refer to the condition a computer running such a workload is in, in which its processor utilization is high, perhaps at 100% usage for many seconds or minutes, and interrupts generated by peripherals may be processed slowly or be indefinitely delayed.

==As applied to jobs==
CPU-bound jobs will spend most of their execution time on actual computation (&quot;number crunching&quot;) as opposed to e.g. communicating with and waiting for peripherals such as network or storage devices (which would make them I/O bound instead). Such jobs can often benefit from parallelization techniques such as multithreading if the underlying algorithm is amenable to it, allowing them to distribute their workload among multiple CPU cores and be limited by its multi-core rather than single-core performance.

==As applied to computers==

The concept of CPU-bounding was developed during early computers, when data paths between computer components were simpler, and it was possible to visually see one component working while another was idle. Example components were CPU, tape drives, hard disks, card-readers, and printers. Computers that predominantly used peripherals were characterized as I/O bound. Establishing that a computer is frequently CPU-bound implies that upgrading the CPU or optimizing code will improve the overall computer performance.

With the advent of multiple buses, parallel processing, multiprogramming, preemptive scheduling, advanced graphics cards, advanced sound cards and generally, more decentralized loads, it became less likely to identify one particular component as always being a bottleneck. It is likely that a computer&#x27;s bottleneck shifts rapidly between components. Furthermore, in modern computers it is possible to have 100% CPU utilization with minimal impact to another component. Finally, tasks required of modern computers often emphasize quite different components, so that resolving a bottleneck for one task may not affect the performance of another. For these reasons, upgrading a CPU does not always have a dramatic effect. The concept of being CPU-bound is now one of many factors considered in modern computing performance.

<text>JHOVE (JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment) - pronounced &quot;jove&quot; - is a format-specific digital object validation API written in Java. JHOVE was a joint project of JSTOR and the Harvard University Library to develop an extensible framework for format validation. The Open Preservation Foundation took over stewardship of JHOVE in February 2015.

JHOVE is currently available for downloading as version 1.22. It is licensed under the LGPLv2. The download includes both a command line and a GUI version. It is designed so that third parties can attach different &quot;heads&quot; to the software, and so can be integrated with other applications that need to validate files. It can be run on any Unix, Windows, or Macintosh OS X platform which supports Java 1.6.

Currently supported formats are AIFF, ASCII, Bytestream, GIF, HTML, JPEG, JPEG 2000, PDF, TIFF, UTF-8, WAV, and XML. Documents are analyzed and checked for being well-formed (consistent with the basic requirements of the format) and valid (generally signifying internal consistency). JHOVE notes when a file satisfies specific profiles within formats (e.g., PDF/X, HTML 4.0).

A successor called JHOVE2 is currently available; however, it has a completely separate code base, and was last updated in 2014.

<doc id="648714" wikidata="Q133018" url="?curid=648714" title="Coat of arms of Germany">
<text>The coat of arms of Germany, also known as Bundeswappen displays a black eagle with a red beak, a red tongue and red feet on a golden field, which is blazoned: &quot;Or, an eagle displayed sable beaked langued and membered gules&quot;. This is the  (German for ), formerly known as (, German for ). It is one of the oldest coats of arms in the world, and today the oldest national symbol used in Europe.

It is a re-introduction of the coat of arms of the Weimar Republic (in use 1919–1935), which was adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1950. The current official design is due to (1887–1967) and was originally introduced in 1928.

The German Empire of 1871–1918 had re-introduced the medieval coat of arms of the Holy Roman Emperors, in use during the 13th and 14th centuries (a black single-headed eagle on a golden background), before the emperors adopted the double-headed eagle, beginning with Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1433. The single-headed Prussian Eagle (on a white background; blazoned: &quot;Argent, an eagle displayed sable&quot;) was used as an escutcheon to represent the Prussian kings as dynasts of the German Empire. The Weimar Republic introduced a version in which the escutcheon and other monarchical symbols were removed.

The Federal Republic of Germany adopted the Weimar eagle as its symbol in 1950. Since then, it has been known as the &quot;Bundesadler&quot; (&quot;federal eagle&quot;). The legal basis of the use of this coat of arms is the announcement by President Theodor Heuss, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Interior Minister Gustav Heinemann of 20 January 1950, which is word for word identical to the announcement by President Friedrich Ebert and Interior Minister Erich Koch-Weser by 11 November 1919:

Since the accession (1990) of the states that used to form the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Eagle has been the symbol of the reunified Germany.

Official depictions of the eagle can be found not only in the federal coat of arms but also on the federal institutions flag, the standard of the president of Germany and official seals. These are designs by various artists of the Weimar period and differ primarily in the shape and position of the wings. A large and rather plump version of the eagle decorates the chamber of the Bundestag, the German parliament; it is sometimes called &quot;Fette Henne&quot; (&quot;Fat Hen&quot;), with a similar representation found on the German euro coins.
In addition to the official depictions, artistic renderings of the federal eagle are permitted and have found their way onto coins, stamps and the letterhead of federal authorities. In 1997 the Federal Press Office implemented a slightly simplified version of the original von Weech seal design which has since been used as a corporate design of the Federal government especially for publications and media appearances. It has no official status though as it is not mentioned in any ordinance or shown in the binding patterns of 1952 still in effect.

==Previous versions==
===Holy Roman Empire===
The German Imperial Eagle () originates from a proto-heraldic emblem believed to have been used by Charlemagne, the first Frankish ruler crowned Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in 800, and derived ultimately from the &quot;Aquila&quot; or eagle standard, of the Roman army.

By the 13th century the imperial coat of arms was generally recognized as: &quot;Or, an eagle displayed sable beaked and membered gules&quot; (a black eagle with wings expanded with red beak and legs on a gold field). During the medieval period the imperial eagle was usually single-headed. A double-headed eagle is attributed as the arms of Frederick II in the (). In 1433 the double-headed eagle was adopted by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. Thereafter the double-headed eagle was used as the arms of the German emperor, and hence as the symbol of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. From the 12th century the Emperors also used a personal coat of arms separate from the imperial arms. From the reign of Albert II (reigned 1438–39), the Emperors bore the old Imperial arms with an inescutcheon of pretence of his personal family arms, which appears as the black eagle with an escutcheon on his breast.


===German Confederation===

In 1815, a German Confederation (&quot;Bund&quot;) of 39 loosely united German states was founded on the territory of the former Holy Roman Empire. Until 1848, the confederation did not have a coat of arms of its own. The Federal Diet (&quot;Bundestag&quot;) meeting at Frankfurt am Main used a seal which carried the emblem of the Austrian Empire, since Austria had taken over the union&#x27;s leadership. It showed a black, double-headed eagle, which Austria had adopted just before the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.

During the 1848 revolution, a new &quot;Reich&quot; coat of arms was adopted by the National Assembly that convened in St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Frankfurt. The black double-headed eagle was retained, but without the four symbols of the emperor: the sword, the imperial orb, the sceptre and the crown. The eagle rested on a golden shield; above was a five-pointed golden star. On both sides the shield was flanked by three flags with the colors black-red-gold. The emblem, however, never gained general acceptance.

The coat of arms itself was the result of a decision of the federal assembly:


===North German Confederation===
In 1867, the North German Confederation was established without Austria and the four southern German states (Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt with only its southern half) and under the leadership of the Kingdom of Prussia (see Coat of arms of Prussia). A new coat of arms was adopted, which consisted of a shield with the colors black-white-red, flanked by two wild men holding cudgels and standing on a pedestal.

===German Empire===

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
The had already been introduced at the Proclamation of Versailles, although the first version had been only a provisional one. The design of the eagle was altered at least twice during the German Empire (1871–1918). It shows the imperial eagle, a comparatively realistic black eagle, with the heraldic crown of the German Empire. The eagle has a red beak, tongue and claws, with open wings and feathers. In contrast to its predecessor, the eagle of the German Confederation, it has only one head, looking to the right, symbolising that important parts of the old empire, Austria and Bohemia, were not part of this new empire. Its legal basis was an imperial rescript: 


===Weimar Republic===
After the introduction of the republic the coat of arms of Germany was also altered accounting for the political changes. The Weimar Republic (1918–1933), retained the without the symbols of the former Monarchy (Crown, Collar, Breast shield with the Prussian Arms). This left the black eagle with one head, facing to the right, with open wings but closed feathers, with a red beak, tongue and claws and white highlighting.

The republican is based on the introduced by the Paulskirche Constitution of 1849, which was decided by the Germany National Assembly in Frankfurt upon Main, at the peak of the German civic movement demanding parliamentary participation and the unification of the German states. The achievements and signs of this movement had been mostly done away after its downfall and the political reaction in the 1850s. Only the tiny German Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont upheld the tradition and continued to use the German colours called Schwarz-Rot-Gold in German ().

These signs had remained symbols of the Paulskirche movement and Weimar Germany wanted to express its view of being also originated in that political movement between 1848 and 1852. The republican coat of arms took up the idea of the German crest established by the Paulskirche movement, using the same charge animal, an eagle, in the same colors (black, red and or), but modernising its form, including a reduction of the heads from two to one. The artistic rendition of the eagle was very realistic. This eagle is mounted on a yellow (golden) shield. The coat of arms was announced in 1919 by the President Friedrich Ebert and Interior Minister Erich Koch-Weser:
However, in 1928 the Reichswappen (Reich&#x27;s coat of arms) designed by Tobias Schwab (1887–1967) in 1926 (or 1924) for the German Olympic team became the official emblem. The Reichswehr adopted the new Reichswappen already in 1927. Emil Doepler&#x27;s earlier design then became the &quot;Reichsschild&quot; (Reich&#x27;s escutcheon) with restricted use such as pennant for government vehicles. In 1920, designed a &quot;Staatssiegel&quot; (State seal), of which the smaller version was used since 1921 by all Reich ministries and authorities on official documents as a consistent sign. It also appeared on the German passports. In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany adopted all signs of Weimar Republic, Reichswappen, Reichsschild, Staatssiegel, Reichsflagge as Bundeswappen, Bundesschild. Bundessiegel and Bundesflagge in the 1950s.

===Nazi Germany===
Nazi Germany used the Weimar coat of arms until 1935. The Nazi Party used a stylised black eagle above an oak wreath, with a swastika at its centre. With the eagle looking over its left shoulder, that is, looking to the right from the viewer&#x27;s point of view, it symbolises the Nazi Party, and was therefore called the &quot;Parteiadler&quot;. After 1935 the Nazis introduced their party symbol as the national insignia (&quot;Hoheitszeichen&quot;) as well. This version symbolises the country (&quot;Reich&quot;) and was therefore called the . It can be distinguished from the &quot;Parteiadler&quot; because the eagle of the latter is looking over its right shoulder, that is, looking to the left from the viewer&#x27;s point of view. The emblem was established by a regulation made by the Fuhrer and Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler, 5 November 1935:
Hitler added on 7 March 1936 that:

===German Democratic Republic===
East Germany (German Democratic Republic) used a socialist insignia from 1950 until its reunification with West Germany in 1990. In 1959 the insignia was also added to the flag of East Germany.
