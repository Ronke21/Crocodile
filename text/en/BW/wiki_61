<text>Sharron Elizabeth Davies, (born 1 November 1962) is an English former competitive swimmer who represented Great Britain in the Olympics and European championships and competed for England in the Commonwealth Games. Davies has attended 12 consecutive Olympic Games, competing in three games and then working in the media for the BBC Sport.

She competed in three Olympic Games over three decades, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. She also competed in the international community spanning over 20 years.

Since retiring from the sport, she has worked for various media organisations and programmes. In 2005, Davies supported the British Olympic bid by profile-raising and appearing as spokesperson on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; where she made a strong case for bringing the games to London for 2012. Davies is a current patron of the Disabled Sport England and SportsAid. She was also the face of the &quot;Swim for Life&quot; charity event which raised total over £10m for many charities. She has publicly expressed her opinions on transgender people in sports.

==Early life==

Davies was born in Plymouth, Devon, and grew up in Plymouth and Plymstock. She has twin brothers. She attended Plymstock Comprehensive School and the private school Kelly College, which is now known as Mount Kelly, in Tavistock.

She originally learnt to swim with Devonport Royal Swimming Association. She moved to Port of Plymouth Swimming Association when she was eight and was coached for the first year first by Ray Bickley then by her father Terry Davies who became a coach. Her father was added in 2021 to the Coaches Association Hall of Fame.

==Swimming==

She set a record by swimming for the British national team at the age of 11. In 1976, at age 13, Davies was selected to represent Great Britain at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. The next year she won two bronze medals in the 1977 European Championships. The following year, at age 15, she won gold medals at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in the 200 and 400-metre individual medleys and also a silver and a bronze medal.

In the 1980 Olympics, Davies took the silver medal in the 400 m individual medley behind Petra Schneider from East Germany, who later admitted that the victory was drug enhanced.

At 18, Davies called time on the first stage of her swimming career to build her television profile and a career in modelling. In 1989, and training at Bracknell &amp; Wokingham Swimming Club, she returned to the pool, where she picked up two more medals at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.

== Medals and awards ==
Davies has broken or re broken many British records whilst competing and winning For medals table, see Medal record.

* silver medal in the 400-metre individual medley at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow
* two gold, two silver and two bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games in 1978 and 1990.
* two bronze medals at European Championships

Davies held the Commonwealth Record for 400-metre individual medley for 18 years. She has broken five World Masters records.

In the latest development in the story of the East German state-run doping programme, &quot;The Times&quot; broke the news in 2021 of a possibility that the bronze and silver medals won may be upgraded to gold.

At the ASA National British Championships she won 22 titles – the 100 metres freestyle title in 1978, 200 metres freestyle title in 1977 and 1978, 400 metres freestyle title in 1977, 1978 and 1979, 800 metres freestyle title in 1978, 200 metres backstroke title in 1976, 1977 and 1978, 200 metres medley title in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1989 and 1992, 400 metres medley title in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980 and the 50 metres butterfly title in 1992.

In the 1993 New Year Honours, Davies was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire &quot;for services to swimming&quot;.

== Politics and activism ==
Davies is a supporter of the Conservative Party and endorsed Kemi Badenoch in the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election.

Davies is known for her views on gender identity and trans rights, and has been associated with the gender-critical movement. She has expressed concerns about the impact of self-identification on women&#x27;s sport and spaces, arguing that it may disadvantage cisgender women. These views have generated significant debate and controversy.

In 2019, Davies made comments about participation by trans women in women&#x27;s sport, opposing such participation and saying that trans women hold a biological advantage in sports. She became involved in the question of trans women in sport because at the 1980 Olympics she lost out on gold to Petra Schneider who, along with other East German athletes, had been put on testosterone to enhance their performances through doping.

In a tweet posted on 21 December 2019, Davies expressed her disapproval of drag shows, comparing them to blackface. The statement drew criticism with some commentators finding her comparison to blackface inappropriate and disrespectful of the fight against racism. In response to the criticism, Davies clarified that her comment was not intended to be understood as racist.

In 2022, Davies said that trans women hold a potential biological male performance advantage at the elite level of 10–20% over cisgender women and called for women&#x27;s sport to exclude XY chromosome athletes. In March, she wrote a column for &quot;The Times&quot; arguing that trans women&#x27;s advantage is the result of going through male puberty, resulting in a narrower angle between the hips and knees which testosterone reduction does not eliminate, and called for trans women to compete in an open category rather than being excluded from competition entirely. In the same article, she stated: &quot;This month we saw an athlete, Lia Thomas, who was an average club swimmer as a man claim an NCAA title as the US No 1 woman with 20 years of male development in the tank.&quot;

In her 2023 book, &quot;Unfair Play: The Battle for Women’s Sport&quot;, Davies argues against the inclusion of trans women in women&#x27;s sport. Davies compares trans women competing in women&#x27;s sport to the drug-enhanced performances of GDR women that competed against her and other women, like Ann Osgerby. In September 2023, Davies was reported to be leading a campaign aiming to question Members of Parliament (MPs) on camera about their understanding of the term &quot;woman&quot; and publishing their responses online. The &quot;What Is A Woman?&quot; campaign claims that its volunteers are trained to approach MPs, seeking clarification of their positions on camera.

In 2023, Davies criticised and called for a boycott of sportswear brand Nike after Dylan Mulvaney, a trans woman, promoted a Nike sports bra on social media.

In 2024, Davies suggested that Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwanese Lin Yu-ting, who have both competed as women throughout their career, were competing unfairly and that they are male. She suggested that those who lost to the two boxers in the 2024 Summer Olympics should challenge their defeats and pursue legal action. The International Olympic Committee rejected these claims, stating that the two boxers were both women.

== Personal life ==
In the 1980s, Davies lived with and was engaged to Neil Adams an Olympic and World Championship medallist in judo.

Davies then married gym manager John Crisp in West Sussex in 1987. They were divorced in 1991.

In 1992, she met athlete Derek Redmond at the Barcelona Olympics. In 1994 they were married in Northampton, and had two children. They divorced in 2000.

Davies&#x27;s third marriage was to British Airways pilot Tony Kingston. They were married in 2002 in Gloucestershire. In autumn 2006, she announced that she was three months pregnant after 8 rounds of IVF treatment, having been trying for a baby for four years and suffering two miscarriages. During a Sport Relief event in Devon, she said: &quot;We&#x27;re very optimistic and happy but we&#x27;re cautious, too, because of what we have been through. Giving birth at 44 doesn&#x27;t worry me. So many women go through this as they leave it later to have babies.&quot; Davies gave birth to her third child on 30 January 2007. She separated from Kingston in 2009 after seven years of marriage.

<text>Roger Long (1680 – 16 December 1770) was an English astronomer, and Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge between 1733 and 1770.

Roger Long was the son of Thomas Long of Croxton, Norfolk. He was educated at Norwich School and later admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1696/7. Graduating BA in 1700/1, he became a fellow of Pembroke. He was ordained in 1716, and became Rector of Orton Waterville. He became a Doctor of Divinity in 1728, and Master of Pembroke in 1733. From 1750 until 1770 he was the first holder of the Lowndean Professorship of Astronomy.

One of the great characters of eighteenth-century Cambridge, he built a &quot;water-work&quot; in his garden and paddled round it on a water-cycle. He also constructed a &quot;zodiack&quot;, now considered to be the first planetarium, a hollow sphere that could hold thirty people showing the movements of the planets and constellations which remained in the grounds of Pembroke until 1871.

<text>The Colorado Plateau is a physiographic and desert region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the Southwestern United States. This plateau covers an area of 336,700 km2 (130,000 mi2) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, northern Arizona, and a tiny fraction in the extreme southeast of Nevada. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries.

The Colorado Plateau is largely made up of high desert, with scattered areas of forests. In the south-west corner of the Colorado Plateau lies the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. Much of the Plateau&#x27;s landscape is related to the Grand Canyon in both appearance and geologic history. The nickname &quot;Red Rock Country&quot; suggests the brightly colored rock left bare to the view by dryness and erosion. Domes, hoodoos, fins, reefs, river narrows, natural bridges, and slot canyons are only some of the additional features typical of the Plateau.

The Colorado Plateau has the greatest concentration of U.S. National Park Service (NPS) units in the country outside the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Among its nine national parks are Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands, Arches, Black Canyon, Mesa Verde, and Petrified Forest. Among its 18 national monuments and other protected areas managed by the NPS, the United States Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management are Bears Ears, Rainbow Bridge, Dinosaur, Hovenweep, Wupatki, Sunset Crater Volcano, Grand Staircase–Escalante, El Malpais, Natural Bridges, Canyons of the Ancients, Chaco Culture National Historical Park and the Colorado National Monument.

==Geography==

This province is bounded by the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and by the Uinta Mountains and Wasatch Mountains branches of the Rockies in northern and central Utah. It is also bounded by the Rio Grande rift, Mogollon Rim, and the Basin and Range Province (at the Hurricane Fault). Isolated ranges of the Southern Rocky Mountains, such as the San Juan Mountains in Colorado and the La Sal Mountains in Utah, intermix into the central and southern parts of the Colorado Plateau.
It is composed of six sections:
* Uinta Basin Section
* High Plateaus Section
* Grand Canyon Section
* Canyon Lands Section
* Navajo Section
* Datil Section

As the name implies, the High Plateaus Section is, on average, the highest section. North-south trending normal faults that include the Hurricane, Sevier, Grand Wash, and Paunsaugunt separate the section&#x27;s component plateaus. This fault pattern is caused by the tensional forces pulling apart the adjacent Basin and Range Province to the west, making this section transitional. Occupying the southeast corner of the Colorado Plateau is the Datil Section. Thick sequences of mid-Tertiary to late-Cenozoic-aged lava covers this section. The development of the province has, in large part, been influenced by structural features in its oldest rocks. Part of the Wasatch Line and its various faults form the province&#x27;s western edge. Faults that run parallel to the Wasatch Fault that lies along the Wasatch Range form the boundaries between the plateaus in the High Plateaus Section. The Uinta Basin, Uncompahgre Uplift, and the Paradox Basin were also formed by movement along structural weaknesses in the region&#x27;s oldest rock.

In Utah, the province includes several higher fault-separated plateaus:
* Awapa Plateau
* Aquarius Plateau
* Kaiparowits Plateau
* Markagunt Plateau
* Paunsaugunt Plateau
* Sevier Plateau
* Fishlake Plateau
* Pavant Plateau
* Gunnison Plateau and the
* Tavaputs Plateau.

Some sources also include the Tushar Mountain Plateau as part of the Colorado Plateau, but others do not. The mostly flat-lying sedimentary rock units that make up these plateaus are found in component plateaus that are between above sea level. A supersequence of these rocks is exposed in the various cliffs and canyons (including the Grand Canyon) that make up the Grand Staircase. Increasingly younger east–west trending escarpments of the Grand Staircase extend north of the Grand Canyon and are named for their color:
* Chocolate Cliffs,
* Vermillion Cliffs,
* White Cliffs,
* Gray Cliffs, and the
* Pink Cliffs.

Within these rocks are abundant mineral resources, including uranium, coal, petroleum, and natural gas. A study of the area&#x27;s unusually clear geologic history (laid bare due to the arid and semiarid conditions) has greatly advanced that science. A rain shadow from the Sierra Nevada far to the west and the many ranges of the Basin and Range means that the Colorado Plateau receives of annual precipitation. Higher areas receive more precipitation and are covered in forests of pine, fir, and spruce. Though it can be said that the Plateau roughly centers on the Four Corners, Black Mesa in northern Arizona is much closer to the east–west, north–south midpoint of the Plateau Province. Lying southeast of Glen Canyon and southwest of Monument Valley at the north end of the Hopi Reservation, this remote coal-laden highland has about half of the Colorado Plateau&#x27;s acreage north of it, half south of it, half west of it, and half east of it.
The American Association of Petroleum Geologists divides the Colorado Plateau into four geologic provinces. These are:
* Plateau Sedimentary Province in northern Arizona and southern Utah
* Black Mesa Basin in northeastern Arizona
* San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico 
* Paradox Basin in southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah

==Human history==
The Ancestral Puebloan People lived in the region from roughly 2000 to 700 years ago. A party from Santa Fe led by Fathers Dominguez and Escalante, unsuccessfully seeking an overland route to California, made a five-month out-and-back trip through much of the Plateau in 1776–1777. Despite having lost one arm in the American Civil War, U.S. Army Major and geologist John Wesley Powell explored the area in 1869 and 1872. Using wooden oak boats and small groups of men, the Powell Geographic Expedition charted this largely unknown region of the United States for the federal government.

Construction of the Hoover Dam in the 1930s and the Glen Canyon Dam in the 1960s changed the character of the Colorado River. Dramatically reduced sediment load changed its color from reddish brown (&quot;Colorado&quot; is Spanish for &quot;red-colored&quot;) to mostly clear. The apparent green color is from algae on the riverbed&#x27;s rocks, not from any significant amount of suspended material. The lack of sediment has also starved sand bars and beaches, but an experimental 12-day-long controlled flood from Glen Canyon Dam in 1996 showed substantial restoration. Similar floods are planned for every 5 to 10 years.

==Geology==

One of the most geologically intriguing features of the Colorado Plateau is its remarkable stability. Relatively little rock deformation such as faulting and folding has affected this high, thick crustal block within the last 600 million years or so, although there are some newer features such as the Waterpocket Fold of Capitol Reef (estimated 50–70 million years old). In contrast, provinces that have suffered severe deformation surround the plateau. Mountain building thrust up the Rocky Mountains to the north and east and tremendous, earth-stretching tension produced the Basin and Range Province to the west and south. Sub ranges of the Southern Rocky Mountains are scattered throughout the Colorado Plateau.

The Precambrian and Paleozoic history of the Colorado Plateau is best revealed near its southern end, where the Grand Canyon has exposed rocks with ages that span almost 2 billion years. The oldest rocks at river level are igneous and metamorphic and have been lumped together as Vishnu Basement Rocks; the oldest ages recorded by these rocks fall from 1950 to 1680 million years. An erosion surface on the Vishnu Basement Rocks is covered by sedimentary rocks and basalt flows, and these rocks formed in the interval from about 1250 to 750 million years ago: in turn, they were uplifted and split into a range of fault-block mountains. Erosion greatly reduced this mountain range before the encroachment of a seaway along the passive western edge of the continent in the early Paleozoic. At the canyon rim is the Kaibab Formation, limestone deposited in the late Paleozoic (Permian) about 270 million years ago.

A extension of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains called the Uncompahgre Mountains were uplifted and the adjacent Paradox Basin subsided. Almost 4 mi. (6.4 km) of sediment from the mountains and evaporites from the sea were deposited (see geology of the Canyonlands area for detail).
Most of the formations were deposited in warm shallow seas and near-shore environments (such as beaches and swamps) as the seashore repeatedly advanced and retreated over the edge of a proto-North America (for detail, see geology of the Grand Canyon area). The province was probably on a continental margin throughout the late Precambrian and most of the Paleozoic era. Igneous rocks injected millions of years later form a marbled network through parts of the Colorado Plateau&#x27;s darker metamorphic basement. By 600 million years ago North America had been leveled off to a remarkably smooth surface.

Throughout the Paleozoic Era, tropical seas periodically inundated the Colorado Plateau region. Thick layers of limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale were laid down in the shallow marine waters. During times when the seas retreated, stream deposits and dune sands were deposited or older layers were removed by erosion. Over 300 million years passed as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated.

It was not until the upheavals that coincided with the formation of the supercontinent Pangea began about 250 million years ago that deposits of marine sediment waned and terrestrial deposits dominate. In late Paleozoic and much of the Mesozoic era the region was affected by a series of orogenies (mountain-building events) that deformed western North America and caused a great deal of uplift. Eruptions from volcanic mountain ranges to the west buried vast regions beneath ashy debris. Short-lived rivers, lakes, and inland seas left sedimentary records of their passage. Streams, ponds and lakes produced formations such as the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta in the Mesozoic era. Later a vast desert formed the Navajo and Temple Cap formations and dry near-shore environment formed the Carmel (see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area for details).

The area was again covered by a warm shallow sea when the Cretaceous Seaway opened in late Mesozoic time. The Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm shallow waters of this advancing and retreating seaway. Several other formations were also produced but were mostly eroded following two major periods of uplift.

The Laramide orogeny closed the seaway and uplifted a large belt of crust from Montana to Mexico, with the Colorado Plateau region being the largest block. Thrust faults in Colorado are thought to have formed from a slight clockwise movement of the region, which acted as a rigid crustal block. The Colorado Plateau Province was uplifted largely as a single block, possibly due to its relative thickness. This relative thickness may be why compressional forces from the orogeny were mostly transmitted through the province instead of deforming it. Pre-existing weaknesses in Precambrian rocks were exploited and reactivated by the compression. It was along these ancient faults and other deeply buried structures that much of the province&#x27;s relatively small and gently inclined flexures (such as anticlines, synclines, and monoclines) formed. Some of the prominent isolated mountain ranges of the Plateau, such as Ute Mountain and the Carrizo Mountains, both near the Four Corners, are cored by igneous rocks that were emplaced about 70 million years ago.

Minor uplift events continued through the start of the Cenozoic era and were accompanied by some basaltic lava eruptions and mild deformation. The colorful Claron Formation that forms the delicate hoodoos of Bryce Amphitheater and Cedar Breaks was then laid down as sediments in cool streams and lakes (see geology of the Bryce Canyon area for details). The flat-lying Chuska Sandstone was deposited about 34 million years ago; the sandstone is predominantly of eolian origin and locally more than 500 meters thick. The Chuska Sandstone caps the Chuska Mountains, and it lies unconformably on Mesozoic rocks deformed during the Laramide orogeny.

Younger igneous rocks form spectacular topographic features. The Henry Mountains, La Sal Range, and Abajo Mountains, ranges that dominate many views in southeastern Utah, are formed about igneous rocks that were intruded in the interval from 20 to 31 million years: some igneous intrusions in these mountains form laccoliths, a form of intrusion recognized by Grove Karl Gilbert during his studies of the Henry Mountains. Ship Rock (also called Shiprock), in northwestern New Mexico, and Church Rock and Agathla, near Monument Valley, are erosional remnants of potassium-rich igneous rocks and associated breccias of the Navajo Volcanic Field, produced about 25 million years ago. The Hopi Buttes in northeastern Arizona are held up by resistant sheets of sodic volcanic rocks, extruded about 7 million years ago. More recent igneous rocks are concentrated nearer the margins of the Colorado Plateau. The San Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff, south of the Grand Canyon, are volcanic landforms produced by igneous activity that began in that area about 6 million years ago and continued until 1064 CE, when basalt erupted in Sunset Crater National Monument. Mount Taylor, near Grants, New Mexico, is a volcanic structure with a history similar to that of the San Francisco Peaks: a basalt flow closer to Grants was extruded only about 3000 years ago (see El Malpais National Monument). These young igneous rocks may record processes in the Earth&#x27;s mantle that are eating away at deep margins of the relatively stable block of the Plateau.

Tectonic activity resumed in Mid Cenozoic time and started to unevenly uplift and slightly tilt the Colorado Plateau region and the region to the west some 20 million years ago (as much as 3 kilometers of uplift occurred). Streams had their gradient increased and they responded by downcutting faster. Headward erosion and mass wasting helped to erode cliffs back into their fault-bounded plateaus, widening the basins in-between. Some plateaus have been so severely reduced in size this way that they become mesas or even buttes. Monoclines form as a result of uplift bending the rock units. Eroded monoclines leave steeply tilted resistant rock called a hogback and the less steep version is a cuesta.

Great tension developed in the crust, probably related to changing plate motions far to the west. As the crust stretched, the Basin and Range Province broke up into a multitude of down-dropped valleys and elongate mountains. Major faults, such as the Hurricane Fault, developed that separate the two regions. The dry climate was in large part a rainshadow effect resulting from the rise of the Sierra Nevada further west. Yet for some reason not fully understood, the neighboring Colorado Plateau was able to preserve its structural integrity and remained a single tectonic block.

A second mystery was that while the lower layers of the Plateau appeared to be sinking, overall the Plateau was rising. The reason for this was discovered upon analyzing data from the USARRAY project. It was found that the asthenosphere had invaded the overlying lithosphere, as a result of an area of mantle upwelling stemming from either the disintegration of the descending Farallon Plate, or the survival of the subducted spreading center connected to the East Pacific Rise and Gorda Ridge beneath western North America, or possibly both. The asthenosphere erodes the lower levels of the Plateau. At the same time, as it cools, it expands and lifts the upper layers of the Plateau. Eventually, the great block of Colorado Plateau crust rose a kilometer higher than the Basin and Range. As the land rose, the streams responded by cutting ever deeper stream channels. The most well-known of these streams, the Colorado River, began to carve the Grand Canyon less than 6 million years ago.

The Pleistocene epoch brought periodic ice ages and a cooler, wetter climate. This increased erosion at higher elevations with the introduction of alpine glaciers while mid-elevations were attacked by frost wedging and lower areas by more vigorous stream scouring. Pluvial lakes also formed during this time. Glaciers and pluvial lakes disappeared and the climate warmed and became drier with the start of Holocene epoch.

==Ecology==
The Colorado Plateau is covered with dry grasslands and shrublands, open pinyon-juniper woodland, and mountain woodlands and forests.

==Energy resources==
Electrical power generation is one of the major industries that takes place in the Colorado Plateau region. Most electrical generation comes from coal fired power plants. The rocks of the Colorado Plateau are a source of oil and a major source of natural gas. Major petroleum deposits are present in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado, the Uinta Basin of Utah, the Piceance Basin of Colorado, and the Paradox Basin of Utah, Colorado, and Arizona. The Colorado Plateau holds major uranium deposits, and there was a uranium boom in the 1950s. The Atlas Uranium Mill near Moab has left a problematic tailings pile for cleanup. , 10 million tons of tailings had been relocated out of an estimated 16 million tons. Major coal deposits are being mined in the Colorado Plateau in Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, though large coal mining projects, such as on the Kaiparowits Plateau, have been proposed and defeated politically. The ITT Power Project, eventually located in Lynndyl, Utah, near Delta, was originally suggested for Salt Wash near Capitol Reef National Park. After a firestorm of opposition, it was moved to a less controversial site. In Utah the largest deposits are in aptly named Carbon County. In Arizona the biggest operation is on Black Mesa, supplying coal to Navajo Power Plant. Perhaps the only one of its kind, a gilsonite plant near Bonanza, southeast of Vernal, Utah, mines this unique, lustrous, brittle form of asphalt, for use in &quot;varnishes, paints...ink, waterproofing compounds, electrical insulation...roofing materials.&quot;

==Protected lands==
This relatively high, semi-arid to arid province produces many distinctive erosional features such as arches, arroyos, canyons, cliffs, fins, natural bridges, pinnacles, hoodoos, and monoliths that, in various places and extents, have been protected. Also protected are areas of historic or cultural significance, such as the pueblos of the Ancestral Puebloan culture. There are nine U.S. National Parks, a National Historical Park, nineteen U.S. national monuments and dozens of wilderness areas in the province along with millions of acres in U.S. National Forests, many state parks, and other protected lands. In fact, this region has the highest concentration of parklands in North America. Lake Powell, in foreground, is not a natural lake but a reservoir impounded by Glen Canyon Dam.

<text>Robert William Latimer (born March 13, 1953) is a Canadian canola and wheat farmer who was convicted of second degree murder in the death of his daughter Tracy Lynn Latimer (born November 23, 1980 – October 24, 1993). This case caused a national controversy concerning the definition and ethics of euthanasia as well as the rights of people with disabilities, and resulted in two Supreme Court decisions, &quot;R. v. Latimer&quot; (1997), on section 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and later &quot;R. v. Latimer&quot; (2001), concerning cruel and unusual punishments with reference to section 12 of the Charter. Latimer was released on day parole in March 2008 and was granted full parole in December 2010.

==Farm and family==
Before his imprisonment, Latimer lived near Wilkie, Saskatchewan, on a 1280 acre (520 ha) wheat and canola farm with his wife, Laura, and their four children.

===Tracy Latimer===

Tracy Lynn Latimer was born November 23, 1980. An interruption in Tracy&#x27;s supply of oxygen during the childbirth caused severe cerebral palsy, resulting in severe intellectual and physical disabilities, including violent seizures which were controlled with seizure medication. She had little or no voluntary control of her muscles, wore incontinence pants,
and could not walk or talk. Her doctors described the care given by her family as excellent.

The Supreme Court judgment of 1997 noted, &quot;It is undisputed that Tracy was in constant pain&quot;. In her medical testimony Dr. Dzus, Tracy&#x27;s orthopaedic surgeon, noted &quot;the biggest thing I remember from that visit is how painful Tracy was. Her mother was holding her right leg in a fixed, flexed position with her knee in the air and any time you tried to move that leg Tracy expressed pain and cried out&quot;. She also noted that despite having a hip that had been dislocated for many months Tracy could not take painkillers because she was on anti-seizure medication which, in combination with painkillers, could lead to renewed seizures, stomach bleeding, constipation, aspiration and aspiration pneumonia. Robert Latimer reported that the family was not aware of any medication other than Tylenol that could be safely administered to Tracy.

Considering it too intrusive, the Latimers did not wish a feeding tube to be inserted, though according to the 2001 Supreme Court judgment, it might have allowed more effective pain medication to be administered and it might have improved her nutrition and health. During her life, Tracy had several surgeries, including surgery to lengthen tendons and release muscles, and surgery to correct scoliosis in which rods were inserted into her back.

Tracy attended school regularly in Wilkie. People who worked with Tracy in group homes and schools described her smile, love of music and reaction to horses at the circus. According to the Crown prosecutors&#x27; brief presented at the second trial, &quot;She also responded to visits by her family, smiling and looking happy to see them. There is no dispute that through her life, Tracy at times suffered considerable pain. As well, the quality of her life was limited by her severe disability. But the pain she suffered was not unremitting, and her life had value and quality.&quot;

In October 1993, Dr. Dzus recommended and scheduled further surgery on November 19, 1993, in the hope that it would lessen the constant pain in Tracy&#x27;s dislocated hip. Depending on the state of her hip joint, the procedure might have been a hip reconstruction or it might have involved removing the upper part of her thigh bone, leaving the leg connected to her body by only muscles and nerves. The anticipated recovery period for this surgery was one year. The Latimers were told that this procedure would cause pain, and the doctors involved suggested that further surgery would be required in the future to relieve the pain emanating from various joints in Tracy&#x27;s body.&quot; Dr. Dzus reported that &quot;the post operative pain can be incredible&quot;, and described the only useful short-term solution being the use of an epidural to anesthetize the lower part of the body and help alleviate pain while Tracy was still in the hospital.

==Tracy&#x27;s murder==
On October 24, 1993, Laura Latimer found Tracy dead. She had died under the care of her father while the rest of the family was at church. At first, Latimer stated that Tracy had died in her sleep. When confronted by police with autopsy evidence that high levels of carbon monoxide were found in Tracy&#x27;s blood, Latimer confessed that he had killed her by placing her in his truck and connecting a hose from the truck&#x27;s exhaust pipe to the cab. He said he had also considered other methods of killing Tracy, including Valium overdose and &quot;shooting her in the head&quot;.

Latimer said his actions were motivated by love for Tracy and a desire to end her pain. He described the medical treatments Tracy had had and was scheduled to have as &quot;mutilation and torture&quot;. &quot;With the combination of a feeding tube, rods in her back, the leg cut and flopping around and bedsores, how can people say she was a happy little girl?&quot; Latimer asked.

==Murder trials and appeals==
Latimer was charged with first degree murder, convicted of second degree murder by a jury, and sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 10 years. He subsequently lost an appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. In February 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear a further appeal; and in June 1996, the original Crown prosecutor was charged with attempting to obstruct justice by jury tampering. In February 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a new trial for Latimer because of the allegations of jury tampering; it began on 22 October 1997. Latimer was convicted of second degree murder. The second trial judge had found that a 10-year sentence granted Latimer a constitutional exemption from the mandatory minimum sentence, sentencing Latimer to one year in prison followed by a year of probation, but the original conviction was sustained by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada.

In 2001, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Latimer&#x27;s crime could not be justified by the defence of necessity, and found that, despite the particular circumstances of the case, the lengthy prison sentence given to Latimer was not cruel and unusual, and therefore not a breach of section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court also ruled that Latimer was not denied rights to jury nullification, as no such rights exist, and his prison sentence was thus upheld.

==Imprisonment and parole==
Latimer began serving his sentence on January 18, 2001, and was incarcerated at William Head Institution, a minimum-security facility located 30 kilometres west of Victoria, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island. While in prison, he completed the first year of carpentry and electrician apprenticeships. He continued to operate his family&#x27;s farm with the help of a manager.

On December 5, 2007, Latimer requested day parole from the National Parole Board in Victoria. He told the parole board that he believed killing his daughter was the right thing to do. The board denied his request, saying that Latimer had not developed sufficient insight into his actions, despite psychological and parole reports that said he was a low risk to reoffend unless he was in the same situation again. In January 2008, lawyer Jason Gratl filed the appeal on Latimer&#x27;s behalf, arguing that in denying parole, the board had violated its own rules by requiring admission of wrongdoing and by ignoring the low risk for reoffending. In February 2008, a review board overturned the earlier parole board decision, and granted Latimer day parole stating that there was low risk that Latimer would re-offend. Latimer was released from William Head Prison and began his day parole in Ottawa in March. On his release he stated that he planned to work for a new trial and for identification of the pain medication that the 2001 Supreme Court ruling suggested he could have used instead of killing his daughter.

He later relocated to Victoria, where he was required to live in a half-way house five days a week and could live in his own apartment two days a week. He had been seeking looser parole conditions since August 2009. In July 2010, the National Parole Board denied his request to be allowed to leave the halfway house for five days a week. In August 2010, an appeal was made to the Federal Court of Canada. Justice Mactavish ordered the board to reassess Latimer&#x27;s application. The National Parole Board was also directed by the Judge to apply the least restrictive conditions consistent with society&#x27;s protection. Latimer was assessed to have a low risk of re-offending. In September 2010, the parole board ruled he could be away from his Victoria halfway house for five days a week, but had to check in on the other two days. On November 29, 2010, Latimer was granted full parole and this decision took effect on December 6, 2010.

==Public debate==

===Support for Latimer===
A 1999 poll found that 73% of Canadians believed that Latimer acted out of compassion and should receive a more lenient sentence. The same poll found that 41% believe that mercy killing should be legal. Ethicist Arthur Schafer argued that Latimer was &quot;the only person in Canadian history to spend even a single day in prison for a mercy killing&quot; and that compassion and common sense dictated a reduced sentence and the granting of parole. In the introductory college coursebook, &quot;The Elements of Moral Philosophy&quot;, James Rachels and Stuart Rachels present Latimer&#x27;s actions sympathetically.

===Support for Latimer&#x27;s conviction and sentence===
Numerous disability rights groups obtained intervenor status in the Latimer&#x27;s appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that killing a disabled child like Tracy is no different from killing a non-disabled child and should carry the same penalty. To do otherwise, they argued, would devalue the lives of disabled people and increase the risk of more such killings by their caregivers.
Religious groups representing the Roman Catholic church and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada also appeared as intervenors in Latimer&#x27;s Supreme Court appeal.

Latimer&#x27;s 2007 application for day-parole was rejected primarily because he still denied any wrongdoing. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; columnist Andrew Coyne argued that the National Parole Board was right to expect remorse on Latimer&#x27;s part, because to do otherwise might inspire others to similar actions.

==In popular culture==
In the song &quot;Latimer&#x27;s Mercy&quot; from his album &quot;Scream&quot;, Ozzy Osbourne references the Latimer case.
First presented as a radio play on CBC in 1996, and then adapted and produced on stage by the Great Canadian Theatre Company in 2005, &quot;Mourning Dove&quot; by playwright Emil Sher explores the quandary that Robert Latimer faced as a father. Premiering at Stage Left&#x27;s Balancing Acts Disability Arts Festival in 2003, &quot;Mercy Killing or Murder: The Tracy Latimer Story&quot;, a community collaboration by Michele Decottignies and company, presents a multimedia, Epic Theatre approach to the subject that centres the experiences of Tracy Latimer and people with disabilities.

<doc id="649032" wikidata="Q781129" url="?curid=649032" title="Austin Montego">
<text>The Austin Montego is a British family car that was produced by British Leyland from 1984 until 1988, and then by Rover Group from 1988 until 1995. The Montego was the replacement for both the rear-wheel drive Morris Ital and the front-wheel drive Austin Ambassador ranges to give British Leyland an all-new competitor for the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier.

On its launch, it was sold as both an Austin and an MG. It was the last car to be launched under the Austin marque, and from 1988 it was sold without a marque, following the phasing out of the Austin name.

==Design and development==
The Montego started life as a four-door notchback variant of project LC10. Development on the new model, intended to succeed both the Morris Marina and the Princess ranges by the turn of the 1980s, had begun in 1977 but ultimately the new car was not launched until seven years after development had started; in the meantime, the Marina had been updated and rebadged as the Morris Ital from 1980, whilst the Princess had been updated as the Austin Ambassador in 1982. The Honda based Triumph Acclaim had also been introduced in 1981 largely as a stop-gap to keep potential buyers interested in BL products until both the Montego and the Rover 200 series were launched in 1984.

The Austin Maestro emerged as the five-door hatchback variant. When the designs diverged, the &quot;Montego&quot; became project LM11 (the Maestro being LM10), and remained based on a lengthened version of the LC10s Volkswagen Golf style front MacPherson strut / rear twist beam chassis. The Montego received different front and rear styling following the replacement of designer David Bache with Roy Axe. It also featured body-coloured bumpers (as did the &quot;Maestro&quot;), and front wipers which hid themselves under the bonnet when parked.

The Montego offered many improvements over the Maestro, many of which were later incorporated into the latter, such as a new SOHC engine (the S-series), and a more robust dashboard. As with the Maestro, there was a high-performance MG version which again used the solid-state instrument cluster, trip computer, and synthesised voice for the information and warning systems. The dashboard fitted to the Montego was superior to that originally designed for the Maestro and featured a rally-style tachometer, a service indicator and a representation of the car showing open doors, lights left on, etc.
An estate variant, with larger luggage capacity than its competitors, two additional rear-facing child seats and self-levelling suspension, also styled by Roy Axe, followed shortly and received instant acclaim, winning the company a Design Council award.

There were originally plans to name it the &quot;Rover 400 series&quot;, and pre–production cars in Warwickshire were seen bearing &quot;ROVER&quot; badges, and badged as 413i, 416i, 420 and 420i.
The unrelated 400 series launched in April 1990 while from 1995, a decade &quot;after&quot; the Montego was introduced, the 416i and 420i names would be used, but on the unrelated second-generation Rover 400 series, by that time, the Montego was already out of production.

==To market==


The Montego was launched on 25 April 1984. It was initially available as a four-door saloon only, filling the gap in the range left by the discontinuation of the Morris Ital saloon two months earlier. However, it would be produced alongside the Ital estate until that model was discontinued in August 1984.

The estate variant was launched at the British International Motor Show in October of that year. The MG turbocharged variant was released in early 1985, producing at 5100 rpm and of torque at 3500 rpm. It was as the fastest production MG ever with a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) time of 7.3 seconds, and a top speed of . The Vanden Plas version featured leather seats, walnut veneer and features such as electric windows, central locking and power door mirrors.

Like the Maestro, the Montego suffered from its overly long development phase, which had been begun in 1975 and which was hampered throughout by the industrial turmoil that plagued both British Leyland and Austin Rover Group during this period. The Ryder Report had recommended the costly modernization of both the Longbridge and Cowley factories, and since Longbridge was to come on stream first - the Austin Metro was put in production first, even though its design had been started after the Maestro/Montego. As a direct result of this delay, the two cars were now stylistically out of step, having been styled by several different designers - Ian Beech, David Bache and Roger Tucker had all contributed to the Montego&#x27;s styling. Ultimately, both the Maestro and Montego had been compromised by the use of a single platform (using common doors) to create two vehicles that served in different size classes - a mistake that BMC/BL had made before with the Austin 1800 and the Austin Maxi in the 1960s. When Roy Axe, installed to replace David Bache as Austin Rover&#x27;s director of design in 1982, viewed both cars in prototype form he recommended that they be scrapped and the whole styling exercise restarted; but the development cycle had progressed too far for this to be economically viable. Instead, Axe was forced to make last minute changes - so to make the Maestro-derived centre section blend with the Montego&#x27;s longer wheelbase, the rear wheel arches were accentuated and plastic trim pieces were added to the tops of the doors to disguise the drooping belt line. The trims however were made from a plastic that faded quickly with age, and were poorly fitting.

Like many BL cars before it, early Montegos suffered from build quality and reliability problems which badly damaged the car&#x27;s reputation amongst the public. In some ways, the technology was ahead of its time, notably the solid-state instrumentation and engine management systems, but the &quot;talking&quot; dashboard fitted to high-end models (and initially used to promote the Montego as an advanced high-tech offering) was prone to irritating faults and came to be regarded as something of an embarrassment by BL and the British press. This feature was discontinued after a short period. There were also problems with the early sets of body-coloured bumpers which tended to crack in cold weather at the slightest impact. The S-Series engine (although far superior to the R-Series it replaced), was also prone to top end oil leakage. Like the Maestro, the gear linkage on the VW-sourced transmissions was also a source of problems.

The Montego was heavily dependent on its home British market for sales, and in particular the lucrative fleet sector where it competed directly with both the Ford Sierra and General Motors&#x27; Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Ascona C). By virtue of their wealthy American parent companies, and their much deeper market penetration into continental Europe compared to BL, both Ford and Vauxhall could afford to offer deep discounts to fleets to increase sales and market share. Also, thanks to Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Economic Community, both Ford and General Motors could import cars tariff-free from their continental plants to take advantage of exchange rate fluctuations and further undercut BL. This practice greatly damaged sales of the Montego, and its smaller Maestro sister, and only compounded the early issues with build quality and reliability.

==Later developments==
Development on the Montego continued. A replacement was proposed by Roy Axe in 1986, which would have been the existing Montego core structure clothed with new outer panels to mimic the design language set by the recently launched Rover 800-series, and would have been designated the Rover 400-series. This concept, designated AR16 and planned to go into production around 1989, would have also spawned a five-door hatchback version (designated AR17) to increase Rover&#x27;s options in its rivalry with the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier.

The AR16/17 concepts were however abandoned in November 1988 due to lack of funds, and a facelift to the existing car (designated AR9) released in 1988 enhanced its appeal, which was buoyed up by both the Perkins-engineered diesel model, and the seven-seater version of the &quot;Countryman&quot; estate. The 2-litre turbodiesel (often known by its Perkins designation &#x27;Prima&#x27;) was a development of the O-series petrol engine already used in the range. The diesel saloon won a &quot;Car&quot; magazine &#x27;giant test&#x27; against the Citroën BX (1.8 XUDT), the new Peugeot 405 (1.8 XUDT) and Audi 80 (1.6) turbo diesels. They rated the 405 the best car, followed by the BX and then the Montego, with the Audi coming in last. &quot;But if people buy diesels, and turbodiesels, for their economy, the winner has to be the Montego. ...its engine is - even when roundly thrashed - more than 10% more economical than the rest. For those isolated moments when cost control is not of the essence, the Montego is a car you can enjoy too. The steering and driving position are quite excellent. ...the suspension as &#x27;impressively refined&#x27;. It is silent over rough bumps, poised and well damped.&quot;

The turbo diesel became a favourite of the Royal Air Force (RAF) for officer transport. &quot;Car Mechanics&quot; ran a de-mobbed RAF officer transport Montego bought from a Ministry of Defence auction in 1996.

The facelift also saw the phasing out of the Austin name. These late-1980s models had a badge resembling the Rover Viking longship, but it was not identical, nor did the word &quot;Rover&quot; ever appear on the cars.

Though the car failed to match its rivals, such as the Volkswagen Passat, the car sold well to the likes of the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier.

By the early 1990s, the Montego was terminally aged and its popularity was dwindling, although this was offset by the popularity of new cars like the second generation Rover 200 series, and its saloon equivalent, the Rover 400 Series. Saloon production finished in early 1993 on the launch of the Rover 600 Series. The estate continued until December 1994, almost a year after Rover&#x27;s takeover by BMW. The second generation Rover 400 Series was launched shortly afterwards as a hatchback and a saloon, further filling the gaps in the Rover range left by the phasing-out of the Montego.

In its final year, &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine said &quot;Austin Rover&#x27;s once &#x27;great white hope&#x27;, Montego matured into a very decent car — but nobody noticed&quot;. The chassis development for the Montego and Maestro&#x27;s rear suspension was used as a basis for later Rover cars, and was well regarded.
Montegos continued to be built in small numbers in CKD form at the Cowley plant in Oxford until 1994, when production finally ended. The last car was signed by all those that worked on it, and is now on display at the British Heritage Motor Centre in Gaydon, Warwickshire. A total of 546,000 Austin/Rover Montegos and 23,000 MG Montegos were produced, with Britain by far being the biggest market for the car.

In all, 436,000 Montegos were sold in the UK between 1984 and 1995. In August 2006, a survey by &quot;Auto Express&quot; revealed that the Montego was Britain&#x27;s eighth-most scrapped car of the last 30 years, with just 8,988 still in working order. Contributing to this, areas of the bodywork that were to be covered by plastic trim (such as the front and rear bumpers) were left unpainted and thus unprotected. In addition, pre-1989 models fitted with the A and S-series engines cannot run on unleaded petrol without the cylinder head being converted or needing fuel additives. This led to many owners simply scrapping the cars, as leaded petrol was removed from sale in Britain after 1999, and by 2003 most petrol stations had stopped selling LRP (lead replacement petrol) due to falling demand as the number of cars requiring it declined.

The Austin Montego, like many other Austin Rover cars at the time, offered a high luxury model. Sold opposite the MG, the Montego Vanden Plas was the luxury alternative. The Vanden Plas featured leather seats and door cards (velour in the estate version), powered windows, mirrors, door locks and sunroof. Alloy wheels were offered and later became standard on all cars. An automatic gearbox was also offered. It was available in both saloon and estate bodystyles. All Vanden Plas Montegos were 2.0 litres, either EFi (electronic fuel injection) or standard carburettor engines.

==International markets==

===Europe===
The Montego was sold in several continental European markets. In France, the Estate was particularly popular.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, the Austin Montego was launched in 1984. The only models available were the manual 2.0-litre HLS or Mayfair versions, and only in estate form. The sedan version was not offered in New Zealand due to concerns that it would compete directly with the Honda Accord, locally assembled by the New Zealand Motor Corporation, which had changed from assembling BL to Honda models. Also available from 1987 the Montego sedan was sold in the Vanden Plas range with the 2.0-litre fuel-injected motor.

From about 1989 onwards, a wider range of models were imported by a new company, Rover New Zealand; this included sedan versions for the first time. Also new were the MG 2.0 range (identical to the MG Montego sold in the UK), and all wore the MG badge. The main Auckland dealer developed an air conditioning system as an option for these models in conjunction with local specialists.

===China===
A version of the Austin Maestro with a Montego front end was briefly built in China by FAW, as the Lubao CA 6410 and as the Jiefang CA 6440 UA Van. This was after the rights to the Montego and Maestro had been sold by Etsong in 2003, who had been manufacturing Maestro variants earlier.

===India===
The Montego Estate was sold in India as the Rover Montego in collaboration with Sipani Automobiles - (the company that tried and failed to market the Reliant Kitten in India - a version of the Robin with four wheels and Triumph-inspired front suspension - as the Sipani Dolphin). The car was not a success, selling only 287 examples before being discontinued.

===Taiwan===
From the mid 1980s until the early 1990s, a local importer sold the Montego along with the Mini and Maestro under Austin, then Rover badge.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
From 1997 to 2000, a private importer sold the Montego in this Caribbean nation under the Rover badge. Build quality was poor and the company soon folded.

<doc id="649042" wikidata="Q129827" url="?curid=649042" title="Free energy suppression conspiracy theory">
<text>Free energy suppression (or new energy suppression) is a conspiracy theory that technologically viable, pollution-free, no-cost energy sources are being suppressed by governments, corporations, or advocacy groups. Devices allegedly suppressed include perpetual motion machines, cold fusion generators, torus-based generators, reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology, anti-gravity propulsion systems, and other generally unproven or physically impossible, low-cost energy sources.

==Claims==
The alleged suppression (or weakening) is claimed to have occurred since the mid-19th century and allegedly perpetrated by various government agencies, corporate powers, special interest groups, and fraudulent inventors. The special interest groups are usually claimed to be associated with the fossil fuel or nuclear industry, whose business model would be threatened.

Claims of suppression include:
* The claim that the scientific community has controlled and suppressed research into alternative avenues of energy generation via the institutions of peer review and academic pressure.
* The claim that devices exist which are capable of extracting significant and usable power from pre-existing unconventional energy reservoirs, such as the quantum vacuum zero point energy, for little or no cost, but are being suppressed.
* The claim that related patents have been bought up, such as those for 100 mpg carburetors.

Some people who have been claimed to be suppressed, harassed, or killed for their research are Stanley Meyer, 
Eugene Mallove, 
and Nikola Tesla. Free energy proponents claim that Tesla developed a system (the Wardenclyffe Tower) that could generate unlimited energy for free. His system was only intended to transmit energy for free; the system&#x27;s energy would still need to be generated through conventional means.

Proponents of the conspiracy theory include Gary McKinnon, a Scottish computer hacker who unlawfully accessed computer systems to look for evidence of a secret free energy device.

Followers of the Tartaria conspiracy theory believe an advanced civilization called Tartaria destroyed by a &quot;mud flood&quot; now covered up by the world&#x27;s governments once had free wireless energy.

<doc id="649047" wikidata="Q290794" url="?curid=649047" title="Fli4l">
<text>fli4l (flexible internet router for linux; previously: floppy isdn for linux) is a Linux distribution, actively developed by German developers since 2000. The projects main task is to provide a small Linux system that turns almost every machine into a router. The distribution can run from a floppy disk and was created with the aim of simple configuration and support for older hardware.

fli4l can route between Ethernet and ISDN, DSL or UMTS, or just between Ethernet networks.

==Characteristics and requirements==
fli4l is based on the Linux kernel. As the documentation is very extensive no knowledge of Linux is required, however a basic knowledge of network technology is needed.

The hardware requirements for fli4l are low, an Intel Pentium with MMX support and 64 MiB RAM and (depending upon the configuration) one or two network interface controllers is quite adequate. A hard disk drive is not required, but can be used by fli4l too.

Newer versions of fli4l provide also the possibility to create a working installation on a CF card in a card reader, which card then in turn can operate from a CF adapter in an IDE slot. Also the generation of an ISO image is supported to run from a CD-ROM as well as from DOC/DOM for Embedded systems.

fli4l can be configured on Linux, Unix and Windows systems using just text files.

In addition, fli4l has the possibility to encrypt connections over the Internet or via Wireless LAN using OpenVPN or PPTP (Poptop).

==Versions==
There are two development branches for fli4l, a stable and a development version.

The present stable release is based on a Linux 3.16 kernel and supports virtualization by means of Xen and KVM. USB and Wireless LAN are supported to a great extent as well as current embedded hardware as APU, ALIX, Soekris, and EPIA series.

The 4.0 development version also provides a Linux 4.1 kernel. Furthermore, it implements a new management and configuration layer for connections (so-called circuits) which has been designed from the ground up. It allows to use multiple WAN links (e.g. via DSL, ISDN, or UMTS) in parallel.

==Optional packages==
fli4l is a modular system using so-called OPT-packages. To create an individual configuration, only software packages for those options, that are needed, are downloaded and unzipped into the directory tree. To extend the basic functionality, a wide range of applications is available in the so-called OPT-database; for example, optional packages can be used for monitoring traffic or an fli4l can function as a printserver. This process easily allows own developments, that can be made available to other users via the OPT-database.

==Device control==
An fli4l router can be controlled and monitored with a browser-based interface. Besides, the program imonc (isdn monitor client) is available for Windows and Linux (GTK). imonc allows extensive control as well as remote-controlled update of the router&#x27;s software.

<doc id="649056" wikidata="Q5055024" url="?curid=649056" title="Cavendish Professor of Physics">
<text>The Cavendish Professorship is one of the senior faculty positions in physics at the University of Cambridge. It was founded on 9 February 1871 alongside the famous Cavendish Laboratory, which was completed three years later. William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire endowed both the professorship and laboratory in honour of his relative, chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish.

==History==

===Creation of the Cavendish Laboratory===

Before the middle of the nineteenth century, science was largely pursued by individuals, either wealthy amateurs or academics working in their college accommodation. In 1869, a committee formed by the Senate reported that creating a dedicated Laboratory and Professorship would cost £6,300. The then chancellor of the university, William Cavendish met that cost privately 18months later, and named the department in honour of his relative, the 18th century natural philosopher Henry Cavendish.

===James Clerk Maxwell===
The first Cavendish Professor was the then relatively obscure James Clerk Maxwell, who had yet to complete the work that would make him the most renowned physicist of the nineteenth century. His appointment was announced on 8 March 1871, and despite initial disappointment at his being offered the place, his inaugural lecture was looked forward to by his likely students as well as his future colleagues. However, it was poorly advertised, so it was only to his students that he laid out his plans for physics at Cambridge. When Maxwell began the actual course a few days later with a lecture on heat, it was attended by academics in formal dress, in the belief that it was the first lecture. Maxwell spent the next three years supervising the construction of the dedicated Cavendish Laboratory, and published in 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. Maxwell&#x27;s health deteriorated a short time into his tenure, and he died in 1879, aged 48.

===Lord Rayleigh===
Lord Rayleigh replaced Maxwell immediately upon his death, being universally agreed upon as the only successor. Raleigh spent £1,500 updating the laboratory, and created a new practical course, revolutionising practical instruction, and in 1882 he allowed women to take the course as well. In his five years as Cavendish Professor, he published 50 papers and expanded the number of students to 48.

===J. J. Thomson===
J. J. Thomson was made Cavendish Professor in 1884 at the age of 28, leading one senior member of the University to comment that &quot;Matters have come to a pretty pass when they elect mere boys professors.&quot; In 1895, a change was made to the university regulations which allowed students who had not studied at Cambridge to receive a B.A. by submitting a thesis which was judged &quot;of distinction as a record of original research.&quot; Among the students attracted by this change was future Cavendish Professor Ernest Rutherford. Whilst Thomson was Cavendish Professor, he discovered the electron and the existence of isotopes, and also fostered an atmosphere of friendliness and mutual helpfulness.

===Ernest Rutherford===
Rutherford returned to Cambridge in 1918, and spent the last 19 years of his life there. This was around the time of the change from classical to modern physics, and Rutherford was something of a contradiction, dressing as a Victorian gentleman but working on the cutting edge of physics. Rutherford died suddenly in 1937, marking the end of an era for the Cavendish.

===William Lawrence Bragg===
Sir Lawrence Bragg became Cavendish Professor just before the outbreak of the Second World War, which resulted in many staff joining various defence research establishments, notably to develop radar. Work on neutron physics performed at this time was translated into the Manhattan Project to build an atom bomb.

===Nevill Francis Mott===
Nevill Mott was appointed Cavendish Professor in 1954, bringing with him from Bristol, his expertise in the rapidly developing area of Solid State Physics. 
In 1971 the &quot;Cavendish Professorship of Experimental Physics&quot; was renamed the &quot;Cavendish Professorship of Physics&quot;, implicitly acknowledging the broader role
of both theory and experiment in Physics. 

===Alfred Brian Pippard===
Brian Pippard became the first elected appointee to the newly retitled position in 1971. During his tenure as
Cavendish Professor, Pippard strengthened the Teaching Committee and was proactive in the reform of undergraduate teaching in Cambridge, compiling the 1971 edition of the &quot;Cavendish Problems in Classical Physics&quot;, since studied by generations of Cavendish students. 

Until 1979, the holder of the Cavendish Professorship implicitly held the role of head of the Physics Department at the Cavendish Laboratory. The two positions were separated in 1979, when Alan Cook became the first explicitly appointed Head of Department.

==List of Cavendish Professors==
There have been nine Cavendish Professors since its inception:

* James Clerk Maxwell (1871–1879)
* Lord Rayleigh (1879–1884)
* J. J. Thomson (1884–1919)
* Ernest Rutherford (1919–1937)

* Nevill Francis Mott (1954–1971)
* Brian Pippard (1971–1984)
* Sam Edwards (1984–1995)
* Richard Friend (1995–2020)
* Vacant (2020–present)

<doc id="649059" wikidata="Q336896" url="?curid=649059" title="Lydia Dunn, Baroness Dunn">
<text>Lydia Selina Dunn, Baroness Dunn, (; born 29 February 1940) is a Hong Kong-born retired British businesswoman and politician. She became the second person of Hong Kong origin (the first was Lawrence Kadoorie, Baron Kadoorie) and the first female ethnic Chinese Hongkonger to be elevated to the peerage as a life peeress with the title and style of Baroness in 1990.

Launching her career in British firms Swire Group and HSBC Group, she was an Unofficial Member and then the Senior Member of the Executive Council and Legislative Council of Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, witnessing the major events of Hong Kong including the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. She is best known in Hong Kong for her part in (unsuccessfully) lobbying for the people of Hong Kong to have the right of abode in the United Kingdom after the Handover of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, and she remained influential until her retirement from Hong Kong politics in 1995.

From 1990 to 2010, she also served as a member of the House of Lords, the first person ethnic Chinese to assume such position. She resigned from the House of Lords in 2010 following the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 which effectively disallows &quot;Non-Doms&quot; from sitting in either House of the British Parliament.

==Early life, business and public career==
Dunn was born in Hong Kong to refugee parents from China. She was educated at the St. Paul&#x27;s Convent School in Hong Kong, and at the College of the Holy Names and at the University of California, Berkeley. Upon her return to Hong Kong, she was hired by the Swire Group where she kept rising to the directorships of the John Swire and Sons (HK) Ltd., Swire Pacific Ltd., and Cathay Pacific Airways. In 1981, she became the first woman to sit on the director board of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. From 1992 to 2008, she was the bank&#x27;s deputy chairman.

Dunn also served on many public positions, including the chairmanship of the Trade Development Council from 1983 to 1991. In that capacity, she led missions abroad to promote Hong Kong textile and clothing products as well as stood firm against protectionism in her report for the Trade Policy Research Centre in 1983 on &#x27;Protectionism and the Asian-Pacific Region&#x27;. She was also the director of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation from 1979 to 1985 and served as the chairman of the Prince Philip Dental Hospital from 1981 to 1987, during the formative years of the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Dentistry.

==Political career==
Dunn first entered Hong Kong politics when she was made an &quot;Unofficial Member&quot; of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in 1976 by Governor Murray MacLehose. In 1982, she was made an Unofficial Member of the Executive Council by Governor Edward Youde.

During the Sino-British negotiations over the transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty to China in the early 1980s, Dunn participated as a member of the delegations of Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils, led by Senior Unofficial Member of the Executive Council Sir Sze-yuen Chung, who travelled to London and Beijing to meet with Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping. The aims of the members were to raise the concerns of the Hong Kong people and to negotiate for a better deal for Hong Kong. However, Beijing authorities rejected their suggestion that Hong Kong people had an independent role to play in the negotiations. From 1985 to 1988, Dunn was the Senior Member of the Legislative Council. In 1988, she succeeded Chung to become the Senior Member of the Executive Council.

After the signing of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which ensured Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997, Dunn urged the British government to grant Hong Kong residents the right of abode in Britain. She is best remembered in Hong Kong for breaking down in tears while giving testimony before a British parliamentary committee that was examining the Hong Kong question in May 1989 amidst the tumultuous Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China. Dunn said the British government would be &quot;morally indefensible&quot; for surrendering &quot;British citizens to a regime that did not hesitate to use its tanks and forces on its own people&quot;. Britain refused to change its restrictive nationality policy, but eventually allowed about 50,000 Hong Kong families to become British citizens through the British Nationality Selection Scheme in 1990 in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre. That year, Dunn was appointed to the House of Lords in 1989.

In May 1989, Dunn and several other Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils presented the Basic Law Drafting Committee with a proposal for an &quot;OMELCO Consensus&quot; model for the post-1997 process of electing the Chief Executive, providing a moderate alternative to those put forth by the pro-democracy camp and the conservative hardliners from the business and professional community. However, following Beijing&#x27;s disapproval of the &quot;OMELCO Consensus&quot;, Dunn softened her tone. In a House of Lords debate in 1992, Dunn described having more directly elected seats as &quot;unwise&quot; and talked of it as &quot;reviving uncertainty, tension and discord in our community.&quot; She also said that &quot;for the British Government to put a request to the Chinese Government, asking for democracy -- that, too, will be improper.&quot;

Following Chris Patten&#x27;s arrival in Hong Kong as the colony&#x27;s last governor in 1992, Dunn supported his proposal of separating the Executive Council from the Legislative Council so as to allow for more checks and balances. After a reshuffling of the Executive Council, Dunn became its sole remaining member. Subsequently, she became more outwardly discreet during the Patten governorship. It was widely speculated that she had lost her political influence due to her disagreement with the governor over his more confrontational approach in dealing with the Chinese as compared to her consensual approach. In 1995, Dunn announced that she was retiring from Hong Kong politics, fueling speculation in the media over whether she still believed in the territory&#x27;s future after 1997.

While former British-appointed politicians found new favour with Beijing authorities in the run-up to 1997, Dunn bucked the trend by reinforcing her ties to Britain, retaining her seat in the House of Lords and maintaining high-profile positions in British companies, including HSBC Holdings. In 1996, she relocated to Britain with her British husband Michael Thomas, the former Attorney General of Hong Kong.

Dunn rarely sat or spoke in the House of Lords during her years as a peer. After the passage of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, she resigned from the British upper house in 2010 to preserve her &quot;Non-Dom&quot; status.

==Personal life==
Dunn is married to Michael David Thomas, former Attorney General of Hong Kong in 1988. She has four stepchildren from Thomas&#x27;s previous marriage. She has reportedly been living in London since 1996. In 2010, Dunn auctioned 160 items from her private art collection at Christie&#x27;s, with lots reportedly valued at up to GBP30,000 (HK$354,000) each.

==Honours==
For her services to Hong Kong, Dunn was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1978, and then a CBE (Commander) in 1983. In 1989, she was appointed DBE (Dame Commander), reportedly the first from Hong Kong to have such an honour. One year later, she became the first ethnic Chinese and the first woman Hongkonger to be elevated to the British peerage in the Queen Elizabeth II’s 1990 Birthday Honours.

<text>David Bicknell Truman (June 1, 1913 – August 28, 2003) was an American academic who served as the 14th president of Mount Holyoke College from 1969–1978. He is also known for his role as a Columbia University administrator during the Columbia University protests of 1968. Truman was an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Background and family==

==Political science==
Truman was a prominent political scientist and is known for his contributions to the theory of political pluralism.

==Administrative roles==
He taught at a number of institutions before joining Columbia University in 1950. There, in addition to teaching political science, he undertook a number of administrative roles, serving successively as head of the department of public law and government (1959–61), Dean of Columbia College (1962–67), and Vice-President and Provost (1967–69).

At both campuses he faced student protests and takeovers regarding such difficult issues as race and the Vietnam War. Despite these challenges, which were common on college campuses during the Vietnam Era, Truman left a lasting legacy as a warm and caring leader.&quot;

<text>Lubaczów ( &quot;Liubachiv&quot;) is a town in southeastern Poland, close to the border with Ukraine, with 12,567 inhabitants
Situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship, it is the capital of Lubaczów County and is located northeast of Przemyśl.

==Other names==
Lubaczów is also called (or misspelled as): Libatchov, Libechuyv, Liubachev, Lubachov, Lubatchov, Lubichuv, Lubachow, Lubatchow.

== History ==
Lubaczow was first mentioned in written documents in 1214, when, following the Spis Treaty between Duke Leszek I the White and Andrew II of Hungary, the gord was placed under authority of Voivode of Sandomierz, Pakosław Lasocic. Until 1376, Lubaczow was spelled &quot;Lubacew&quot; or &quot;Ljubacew&quot;. Upon receiving its town charter (1376), the spelling of the name was changed into Lubaczow. Until 1462, Lubaczow was governed by the Dukes of Mazovia, a Polish fief. In that year, it was directly annexed into the Kingdom of Poland, as part of the newly created Bełz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province, in which it remained until 1772. During the Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76), the Battle of Niemirow took place near Lubaczow (October 7–8, 1672).

From 1772 until 1918 Lubaczow belonged to Austrian Galicia, as the town was annexed by the Habsburg Empire after the First Partition of Poland. In 1868, the Austrian authorities moved the seat of the county to nearby Cieszanów, while in 1880, Lubaczow received a rail connection with Jarosław. in 1896 a hospital was built, but three years later, most of the town burned down in a large fire.
In 1918, Poland was declared an independent state: Lubaczów became part of Second Polish Republic’s Lwow Voivodeship. The Lubaczów Company of the Polish Army took part in the Polish–Ukrainian War (1918–1919). In mid-September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, heavy fighting between the advancing Wehrmacht and retreating Polish 21st Mountain Infantry Division commanded by General Jozef Kustron. On September 16, the Battle of Oleszyce took place near Lubaczow, in which General Kustron was killed.

On September 7, 1939: Lubaczów was bombed by German planes, and five days later, the town was occupied by the Germans. On September 26, however, the Red Army seized Lubaczow (see Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact). The town remained under Soviet occupation until June 22, 1941, while German occupation lasted until July 1944, when Lubaczow was recaptured by the Soviets.

After World War II, Lubaczów was one of few locations of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lwów to remain within Poland, when the national boundaries were redrawn in 1945. As a result, former parish church in Lubaczow was named a cathedral, and the part of Lwów Archiodiocese, which remained in Poland, was named the Lubaczow Archdiocese, as Communist government banned all traces of Polish presence of the city of Lwów. In 1984, an inventory of the parish records from the archdiocese of the church archive established there was drawn up. In 1992, the position of the Lubaczów area within the Polish diocesan structure was regularized and it became part of the Diocese of Zamość-Lubaczów. There was still a church archive in Lubaczów. In 1999 Lubaczów became part of the Subcarpathian Voivodeship.

Following World War II and the change of borders, several relics from Eastern Borderlands were transported to Lubaczów. Among them was the miraculous picture of Our Lady of Bełz, relics of Blessed Jakub Strzemie, and the urn with heart of Archbishop Jozef Bilczewski. Furthermore, from 1946 until 1980, the miraculous painting of Our Blessed Lady from Latin Cathedral, Lviv was kept at Lubaczów. It was brought here by Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak.

===Jewish history===

* 1498: The Jews of Lubaczów are mentioned for the first time, when they were granted a lease to collect Lubaczów customs duties that year.
* 1532: The Polish King forbade the Jews of Lubaczów to do any business with the population in the surrounding villages.
* 1538: Tax records show that there were eighteen Jewish families living in Lubaczów who paid taxes to the King.
* 1565: The lustration of this year mentions only three Jewish families living in the town.
* 1621, 1633 &amp; 1639: Lubaczów Jews were involved in trade and crafts, and also had the right to brew beer. They still held the lease for the collection of municipal fees, as well as the royal taxes from the entire starostwo (local administrative unit) in these years.
* 1648–1649: The Cossacks and Ruthenian farmers led by Bohdan Chmielnicki opposed the Polish government. In their eyes the Jews were agents of the Polish rulers, and with barbaric methods they attacked the Jews. In Lubaczów the shops at the Rynek (town square) and in the surrounding streets were completely burnt down.
* 1662: The lustration of that year does not mention any Jewish households, though by the early eighteenth century a relatively large community did exist there, as evidenced by the amount of taxes paid to the royal treasury.
* 1670: There were only five Jewish families in Lubaczów.
* 1765: According to the census of that year, there were 687 Jews obliged to pay taxes who were living in the town and surrounding villages.
* 1787: Around thirty Jewish families in Lubaczów asked the Austrian government to give them land so that they could be farmers, but there was no response to their plea.
* 19th century: The Jewish community in Lubaczów grew stronger and the Jews worked as traders in agricultural products, and peddling in the nearby villages.
* 1880: The eastern and western railway lines in Poland were connected after a new railway was built from Jarosław, and Lubaczów became important after getting its own railway station. That year, the Jewish Community was about 1,300 people (approximately 30% of the total population).
* 1891: A Business directory for Galicia is published, containing about 25000 names of people in the professions. It includes several people from Lubaczów.
* 1899: There was a big fire in Lubaczów in 1899 and the town was largely damaged. Among those who lost their homes were 220 Jewish families comprising almost 1,000 people.
* 1906: The Address Directory for Galicia was published. It had 550 pages.
* 1914–1918: During World War I, around 500 Jews left Lubaczów and many did not come back till the middle of the twenties.
* 1931: According to most sources, there were 6,291 citizens in the town, out of whom 1,794 were Jews (Jews were the second largest group in the town after Poles). 
* 1933: The Jewish Cemetery in Lubaczów was closed by the Polish authorities, and was reopened only after a long public struggle.

* 1939: According to &quot;Where Once We Walked&quot; there were 1,715 Jews in Lubaczów before the Holocaust. According to other sources, there were 2,300.
* September 1 and September 17, 1939: Germany and Soviet Union invade Poland. Lubaczow is occupied by the Soviet Union, until June 1941,
* April 1942: There were 2270 Jews in Lubaczów.
* May 1942: 2000 Jews were brought by the Germans to Lubaczów from the surrounding villages.
* October 1942: The Nazis gave the order that a Jewish ghetto should be established in Lubaczów. Within 48 hours the Jews were overcrowded within the ghetto. Shortly after that the first transport of Jews was sent from Lubaczów to Belzec. Jews from Niemirów and Potilitz were brought to Lubaczów. At its peak, the ghetto became home for 7,000 Jews, who were kept in apartments located in the center of the town. About 5–6 families lived in each apartment.
* November 1942: Most of the Jews from Oleszyce, about 2,000, were brought to Lubaczów.
* December 1942: The Germans promised there would be no further killing of Jews in Lubaczów because most of those who were still there were working for the Germans as slave laborers. The Nazis had already shipped 2500 Jews to the extermination camp at Belzec.
* January 5, 1943: There was a great snowstorm that brought great cold. The Germans collected all finished and unfinished items from the Jewish tailors and shoemakers. A rumor spread that the Germans would kill all the Jews. Whoever had the possibility fled that night from the ghetto.
* January 6, 1943: Around 8 a.m., the final mass execution of the Jews in Lubaczów started. The Germans and their Ukrainian auxiliaries murdered hundreds. The killings continued until January 14. Some were killed when found in their underground secret bunkers. Others were brought to the Jewish cemetery where an estimated 1200 Jews were killed and buried in a mass grave. Some were sent to Belzec extermination camp. The very few Jews who survived did so by fleeing into the forests and by joining the partisans. Only around 20 Lubaczow Jews survived the war.
* July 21, 1944: The Germans finally withdrew and the Soviet Red Army re-occupied Lubaczów. Poland became a communist country aligned with the Soviet Union.

<text>Sulejman Pasha Bargjini (also known in , ) was an ethnic Albanian general, nobleman and Governor of the Ottoman Empire. He was originally from Bargjin, but he settled in the village of Mullet (present-day Albania) and probably served as a Janissary, he was given the title Pasha. He had fought for the Ottomans against the Safavids in Persia. After that he had built a mosque (the Sylejman Pasha Mosque), a bakery and a hammam (Islamic sauna). He founded the settlement of Tirana, now the capital of Albania, in 1614 as an oriental-style town of those times. According to some local legends, he named the town he founded after Tehran, the capital of Persia (nowadays Iran). This, however, is a folk etymology without basis in fact, as Tirana was already mentioned in Venetian documents as early as 1418.

With Sulejman&#x27;s foundations, Tirana soon became the center of Albanian art, culture and religion (especially with the Spread of Islam and the Bektashi Sufism), it became famous because of its strategic position at the heart of Albania.

His resting place, the Suleyman Pasha Tomb, got destroyed by the Communist government. A statue of Sulejman Pasha stands in the square named after him in downtown Tirana. A small street in another part of Tirana also bears his name.

<text>Przeworsk (; ; ) is a town in south-eastern Poland with 15,675 inhabitants, as of 2 June 2009. Since 1999 it has been in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship, and is the capital of Przeworsk County. The ancient Przeworsk culture was named after the town.

Przeworsk was a settlement since the 10th century, though evidence of human settlement in the general area is even older. It is first mentioned in historical records from the 13th century, and was granted its town charter in 1394. From 1772 the town was part of the Habsburg monarchy where it remained until 1918 when an independent Poland returned. Przeworsk is located on European route E40. It also is an important railway junction, with trains going in three directions – east (towards Przemyśl), west (towards Rzeszów) and north (towards Stalowa Wola).

Przeworsk has some 60 historic buildings, including two fortified Gothic abbeys, a town hall, the Lubomirski Palace in classical style, a baroque monastery, and an open-air museum (skansen). The town covers an area of .

== History ==
=== Name variations ===
In 13th century Ruthenian documents, Przeworsk was spelt &quot;Pereworesk&quot;. In the 14th and 15th centuries, its name was subject to variation. It was called &quot;Preworsko&quot;, &quot;Przeworsko&quot;, &quot;Przeworszko&quot;, &quot;Przeworscho&quot;, &quot;Przeiworsko&quot;, &quot;Przyworsko&quot; and &quot;Prziborsko&quot;. Since the 15th century, the name &quot;Przeworsko&quot; was most often used.

=== Recorded history ===
In the early Middle Ages, a defensive gord existed there. The area was included in the emerging Polish state by its first historic ruler Mieszko I in the 10th century. In 981 it was annexed from Poland by the Kievan Rus&#x27;, and afterwards, in the High Middle Ages, it changed owners several times between Poland and the Rus&#x27;, and even fell to the Mongol Empire in the mid-13th century. It was first mentioned in documents from 1280, when, after the Battle of Gozlice (23 February 1280) between Lesser Polish and Ruthenian-Tatar forces, Duke Leszek II the Black raided the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, then vassal of the Golden Horde, capturing and setting alight the city of &quot;Perevoresk&quot;

&quot;Въ лѣт̑ 6789 (1281) Иде Льстько на Лва и взѧ оу него городъ Переворескъ и исъсѣче и люди в нем̑ вси ѿ мала и до велика и город̑ зажьже и поиде назадъ во своӕси&quot;

&quot;In the year 6789, (1281) Leszek attacked Leo I of Galicia, and took his city of Perevoresk and killed all in it, sparing neither young or old and having burnt the town to the ground he left.&quot;
After the Galicia–Volhynia Wars in mid-14th century, this territory of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, was reincorporated to the Kingdom of Poland by King Casimir III the Great and afterwards transformed into the Ruthenian Voivodeship within the larger Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Soon Polish settlers came to the deserted border areas, and in November 1387, King Władysław II Jagiełło ceded Przeworsk to the Voivode of Sandomierz, Jan of Tarnow, Leliwa coat of arms. Przeworsk grew fast, and on 25 February 1393, Jagiełło granted it a town charter.

Until the 18th century, Przeworsk was a private town of several Polish noble families, as it passed through Tarnowski, Ostrogski and Lubomirski ownership. Since 1470, it was the seat of the Land court for the western territory of Przemyśl Land in the Ruthenian Voivodeship. Przeworsk became the second largest town in the area after Przemyśl, prospering in the period known as, the Polish Golden Age. It was situated on a round hill, above sea level. Its center was protected by a rampart with a moat. The town hall was built in the 15th century.

Since Crimean Tatars often raided the southeastern Poland, and sometimes even reached its south-central parts, in 1510 the construction of ramparts was started. The defences of Przeworsk consisted of three main elements: a fortified Bernardine monastery in the east, a fortified Order of the Holy Sepulchre monastery in the west, and the town with its three gates in the middle. These fortifications turned out to be inadequate, as both in 1612 and 1624, Przeworsk was captured by the Tatars. Later, the town was captured by the Cossacks (1672, 1677), Swedes (1702) and Russians during the Great Northern War. On 22/23 March 1656, Charles X Gustav of Sweden spent one night here, during his failed raid on south-central Poland. Przeworsk suffered in several successive fires (1712, 1717, 1739, 1740, 1759). All these events contributed to the town&#x27;s steep decline.

In the mid-18th century, the town&#x27;s population consisted of 76% Roman Catholics (Poles) and 24% Jews. 
In First Partition of Poland, in 1772, Przeworsk was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, remaining in Austrian Galicia until November 1918. In the late 18th century, the Austrian authorities pulled down the obsolete late-medieval ramparts and gates. The town remained in decline until the late 19th century, when it became a railway junction, and a center of sugar production, with the Przeworsk Sugar Refinery (1895). In 1859, Przeworsk was connected by rail with Kraków by the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis. In 1902 it had a new railroad to Rozwadów, and in 1904, a narrow gauge line to Dynów was completed. The population began to grow, new housing was built, together with a monument dedicated to King Władysław II Jagiełło (1910), but World War I brought destruction to the town.

In 1918 Poland regained independence, and in the Second Polish Republic Przeworsk was part of Lwów Voivodeship. In 1929, it became of a county seat and in 1930, several buildings burned down in a fire.

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Germany conducted air raids on 3, 5 and 6 September 1939, in which several people were killed and many were wounded. Przeworsk was captured by the Wehrmacht on 9 September 1939, and then the &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town to commit various atrocities against Poles. The German occupation lasted until 27 July 1944. During the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, on November 3, 1939, the Germans deceitfully gathered the local Polish intelligentsia for a formal meeting, then arrested 58 people and imprisoned them in Rzeszów. The Jewish community was decimated in German extermination camps.

The Pshevorsk Hasidic dynasty, which originated in Przeworsk, is now mainly located in Antwerp, Belgium.

<text>Samuel Delucenna Ingham (September 16, 1779 – June 5, 1860) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative and the U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Andrew Jackson.

==Early life and education==
Ingham was born in New Hope, Pennsylvania, on September 16, 1779. His parents were Dr. Jonathan Ingham, &quot;a famous physician from Philadelphia&quot;, and his wife, the former Ann Welding.

After a pursuit of classical studies, he was an apprentice to a paper maker along Pennypack Creek, not far from Philadelphia.

==Manufacturer==
After completing his apprenticeship, Ingham became the manager of a paper mill at Bloomfield, New Jersey. It was while here he met Rebecca Dodd, whom he married in 1800. They had five children.

Also in 1800, Ingham returned to Pennsylvania and established a paper mill on his mother&#x27;s farm (his father having died in 1793) that would be his main source of employment in the coming years.

==Political career==

He was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1806 to 1808. Then, Ingham was appointed Justice of the Peace by the Governor of Pennsylvania.

He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1813 to July 6, 1818. He easily trounced his Federalist opponents in the first two elections and had no opposition at all in 1816. He resigned from Congress in 1818 because of his wife&#x27;s ill health. He was appointed the Prothonotary (Chief Clerk, Notary and Registrar of the Court) of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, after leaving Congress. In 1819 Rebecca Dodd Ingham died.

Ingham served as Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from 1819 to 1820.

In 1822, Ingham married Deborah Hall of Salem, New Jersey. They would become the parents of three children.

Also in 1822, Ingham was elected to Congress where he would serve until 1829.

During the 13th Congress he was chair of the United States House Committee on Pensions and Revolutionary War Claims. During the 14th, 15th, 19th and 20th Congresses, he was chair of the House Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, and he was chair of the House Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department during the 15th Congress.

===Secretary of the Treasury===
Ingham served as the ninth Secretary of the US Treasury from March 6, 1829, to June 21, 1831.

The Second Bank of the United States, viewed by Jackson and much of the nation as an unconstitutional and dangerous monopoly, was Ingham&#x27;s primary concern as Secretary of the Treasury. Jackson mistrusted the Second Bank of the United States and all other banks.

Jackson thought that there should be no paper currency in circulation but only coins and that the US Constitution was designed to expel paper currency from the monetary system. Ingham believed in the Second Bank and attempted to resolve conflicts between Jackson, who wanted it destroyed, and the Bank&#x27;s president, Nicholas Biddle.

Despite being unable to reach any resolution between Jackson and Biddle, Ingham left office over an unrelated incident, which stemmed from his involvement in the social ostracism of Peggy Eaton, the wife of Secretary of War John H. Eaton, by a group of Cabinet members and their wives. It was led by Floride Calhoun, the wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun and became known as the Petticoat affair. Eaton challenged Ingham to a duel, which Ingham did not accept. On June 20, 1831, Eaton recruited a posse to search for Ingham, and Ingham responded by arming himself and requesting Jackson&#x27;s help. With no help forthcoming from the president, Ingham fled to Baltimore the following morning and then to Bucks County, thus likely saving his life.

==Societies==
During the 1820s, Ingham was a member of the prestigious Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which counted among its members two eventual presidents, Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, and many other prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical, and other professions. In 1840, Ingham was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

==Later life==
After resigning as Secretary of the Treasury, Ingham resumed the manufacture of paper, and engaged in the development of anthracite coal fields. He was involved with the organization of the Beaver Meadow Railroad Company (e. 1830), of which he was then made president for a time. He was connected with the organization of the Hazleton Coal Company. He worked to promote canals such at the Lehigh Navigation and the Delaware Canal. He moved to Trenton, New Jersey, in 1849, where he worked with that city&#x27;s Mechanics Bank.

Ingham died on June 5, 1860, in Trenton, New Jersey, at the age of 80, and is interred in the Solebury Presbyterian Churchyard, Solebury, Pennsylvania. Ingham County, Michigan, one of several Cabinet counties named for members of Jackson&#x27;s administration, is named in Ingham&#x27;s honor; the city of Lansing, mostly situated in Ingham County, would later become Michigan&#x27;s capital and center of its third-largest metropolitan area. Ingham Avenue in Trenton, NJ is also named in his honor.

<text>Brzozów ( &quot;Brezhov&quot;; lat. &quot;Brozovia&quot;, or &quot;Prozzow&quot;) is a town in south-eastern Poland, with 7,336 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is situated in Subcarpathian Voivodeship and is the seat of both Brzozów County and the smaller administrative district of Gmina Brzozów. It lies south of the city of Rzeszów.

== History ==

Brzozów was founded in 1359, Brzozów took on the name of an earlier, adjacent settlement of the 14th century, which gradually over time came to be known as Stara Wieś (Old Village). A large Jesuit Basilica and Monastery, built in 1760, is found in Stara Wieś. Queen Mary donated Brzozów and four other villages to the Bishops of Przemyśl in 1384. From the middle 14th to the early 19th centuries, the Bishops of Przemyśl resided principally at Brzozów.

Tatar attacks took place in 1525, 1623–25, 1629 and with heavy losses in 1674. Afterwards, Brzozów declined commercially until the 19th century.

From the First Partition of Poland in 1772 until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district with the same name, one of the 78 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Austrian Galicia province (Crownland).

In the interwar period, the town was a county seat in the Lwów Voivodeship of Poland. According to the 1921 census, it had a population of 4,160, 72.9% Polish and 26.5% Jewish.

Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany until 1944. A large part of the Jewish minority was massacred on 10 August 1942 by the German SS. The remainder were sent to death camps or murdered by the Nazis during the war. Since then, there has been no Jewish presence in the town.

== Economy ==
In 1550–1650, nineteen trades were practiced here including cloth-making, food processing, and leather-making as well as wood, metal, and ceramic trades. The first hospital of record is mentioned in 1518. A parish school was in existence in the early 16th century, and annual elections of mayors and judges, subject to approval of the bishop, commenced in 1410. The town for hundreds of years had been known for the manufacture of combs, but the industry disappeared by the 1960s. Manufacture of oils was another industry in Brzozów; walnut oil was a famous product reportedly supplied to the royal table in Kraków in the 16th century. Oils were also produced from plum core.

A post-office was opened in 1851.

<doc id="649078" wikidata="Q885809" url="?curid=649078" title="Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)">
<text>The Blue Mountains are a mountain range in the northwestern United States, located largely in northeastern Oregon and stretching into extreme southeastern Washington. The range has an area of about , stretching east and southeast of Pendleton, Oregon, to the Snake River along the Oregon–Idaho border.

The Blue Mountains cover ten counties across two states; they are Union, Umatilla, Grant, Baker, Wallowa and Harney counties in Oregon, and Walla Walla, Columbia, Garfield and Asotin counties in Washington. The Blue Mountains were named after the color of the mountains when seen from a distance and the blue hue imparted by the smoke of forest and range fires set by Indigenous people as management tools in the fall.

The Blue Mountains are unique as the home of the world&#x27;s largest living organism, a subterranean colonial mycelial mat of the fungus &quot;Armillaria ostoyae&quot;.

==Geology==
The Blues are uplift mountains and contain some of the oldest rocks in Oregon. Rocks as old as 400 million years protrude through surrounding Columbia River Basalt flows and related volcanics of 16.7 million to about 6 million years ago.
Geologically, the oldest rocks of the Blue Mountains (400+ to about 150 million years in age) were created as island arcs in the Pacific Ocean and accreted onto the North American plate. Today, this suture zone runs through Western Idaho (Riggins and McCall). Within these terranes are igneous intrusions, some of which have intruded after accretion. The Blue Mountains include several mountain ranges, from the Ochoco Mountains and Maury Mountains in the west near Prineville, Oregon, through the Greenhorn Mountains, the Aldrich Mountains, and the Strawberry Range, to the Elkhorn Mountains. The tallest peaks are Rock Creek Butte at in the Elkhorn Mountains, and Strawberry Mountain at in the Strawberry Range.

The ranges of the Blue Mountains were uplifted by folding upward into the &quot;Blue Mountain Anticline&quot; by tectonic rotation that began about 14 million years ago. More limited faulting and extension in places that include Baker valley and the Grande Ronde valley also contributed to today&#x27;s topography. The Wallowa Mountains are considered to be part of the Blues by many geologists because their geology includes the same accreted terranes as the Elkhorns, Greenhorns, and Strawberries, although their mechanism of uplift differs somewhat. Similarly, the geology of Hells Canyon and the Seven Devils Mountains is also composed of accreted terranes of a similar nature.

==History==

===Habitation by Native Americans===

The river valleys and lower levels of the range were occupied by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Historic tribes of the region included the Walla Walla, Cayuse people and Umatilla, now acting together as the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, located mostly in Umatilla County, Oregon. The southern portion of the Blue Mountains were inhabited by several different bands of the Northern Paiute, a Great Basin culture. Native American tribes originally migrated to the Blue Mountains for hunting and salmon runs. The Natives used to purposefully burn small parts of the forest in order to create pastures to attract game for hunting.

===During westward expansion of the United States===
In the mid-1800s, the Blue Mountains were a formidable obstacle to settlers traveling on the Oregon Trail and were often the last mountain range American pioneers had to cross before either reaching southeast Washington near Walla Walla or passing down the Columbia River Gorge to the end of the Oregon Trail in the Willamette Valley near Oregon City.

===Modern travel===

The range is currently traversed by Interstate 84, which crosses the crest of the range at a summit, from south-southeast to north-northwest between La Grande and Pendleton. The community of Baker City is located along the south-eastern flank of the range. U.S. Route 26 crosses the southern portion of the range, traversing the Blue Mountain Summit and reaching an elevation of .

It is also crossed by the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s mainline between Portland, Oregon, and Pocatello, Idaho, which crests the summit at Kamela, Oregon. The summit lies on Union Pacific&#x27;s La Grande Subdivision, which runs between La Grande and Hinkle, the latter of which is the site of a major UP yard.

== Wildlife ==
Birds of the area include bald eagle, Lewis&#x27;s woodpecker, Williamson&#x27;s sapsucker, red-breasted nuthatch, golden-crowned kinglet and many migratory species, with the riverbanks important habitat for this birdlife. Mammals that move through the mountain grasslands include Rocky Mountain elk, Bighorn sheep and Mule deer. Native fish include Chinook Salmon, Steelhead, Redband Trout, Bull Trout, and Pacific Lamprey.

The Blue Mountains in Washington are home to one of 10 identified elk herds in the state, with a population of approximately 4,500 Rocky Mountain elk as of 2018 across the region. In 1989, in response to a decline in the elk population and a heavy female-biased population, the Washington Fish &amp; Wildlife Department regulated elk hunting in the Washington Blue Mountains with a &quot;spike-only&quot; general hunting season, permitting hunting of only male elk with at least one visible non-branched antler. By the mid 1990s the area then became known for its mature males and trophy hunting. In 2018, Washington State proposed an updated elk management plan intended to improve the health of elk populations and habitats, reduce human conflict and agricultural damage, and managing elk populations for recreational, educational, scientific, and ceremonial purposes.

== Land management ==
The lands in the Blue Mountains are managed not only by the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management public agencies, but also by private land owners and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.

==Location==

Much of the range is included in the Malheur National Forest, Umatilla National Forest, and Wallowa–Whitman National Forest. Several wilderness areas encompass remote parts of the range, including the North Fork Umatilla Wilderness, the North Fork John Day Wilderness, the Strawberry Mountain Wilderness, and the Monument Rock Wilderness, all of which are in Oregon. The Wenaha–Tucannon Wilderness sits astride the Oregon–Washington border.

==Drainage==

The range is drained by several rivers, including the Grande Ronde and Tucannon, tributaries of the Snake, as well as the forks of the John Day, Umatilla and Walla Walla rivers, tributaries of the Columbia. The southernmost portion of the Blue Mountains is drained by the Silvies River, in the endorheic Harney Basin.

<text>The Rouse Ball Professorship of Mathematics is one of the senior chairs in the Mathematics Departments at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. The two positions were founded in 1927 by a bequest from the mathematician W. W. Rouse Ball. At Cambridge, this bequest was made with the &quot;hope (but not making it in any way a condition) that it might be found practicable for such Professor or Reader to include in his or her lectures and treatment historical and philosophical aspects of the subject.&quot;

==List of Rouse Ball Professors at Cambridge==

<text>Samuel Ingham (September 5, 1793 – November 10, 1881) was a two-term Congressman from Connecticut.

==Early life==
Samuel Ingham was born on September 5, 1793, in Hebron, Connecticut. He attended the common schools in Vermont, studied law with John Mattocks and Sylvester Gilbert, was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Canaan, Vermont. He moved to Jewett City, Connecticut, and in 1819, to Essex (then part of Saybrook), Connecticut, and continued the practice of his profession.

==Career==
He served as state&#x27;s attorney for Middlesex County, and was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1828, 1834, 1851 and 1852 (serving as speaker in 1833, 1835 and 1851). He served as judge of probate judge of the Middlesex County Court. He was elected as a Jacksonian to the Twenty-fourth Congress and reelected as a Democrat to the Twenty-fifth Congress (March 4, 1835 – March 3, 1839). He was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs (Twenty-fifth Congress). He was defeated for re-election in 1839 to the Twenty-sixth Congress.

He served in the Connecticut Senate in 1842, 1846, and 1850. He served as President pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate and was four times the Democratic nominee for governor of Connecticut (1854–57). Although he finished in first place twice, winning a plurality of more than 10% both times (1854 &amp; 1856), lacking a popular majority, the legislature chose a different candidate. He was also an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in 1854. He served as United States commissioner of customs from December 5, 1857, to May 14, 1861. He then resumed the practice of law.

==Personal life==
He lived in Saybrook and Essex. Ingham died in Essex on November 10, 1881. He was interred in River View Cemetery.

His daughter Lydia Ann Ingham was the wife of James Phelps, who also served in Congress. His daughter Mary Wilson Ingham married Edward Champlin Williams, a merchant sea captain.

<text>The Drifters is a novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author James A. Michener, published in 1971 by Random House. The novel follows six young characters from diverse backgrounds and various countries as their paths meet and they travel together through parts of Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Mozambique. The story is told from the perspective of the narrator, George Fairbanks, who is an investment analyst for the fictional company World Mutual Bank in Switzerland. Mr. Fairbanks is connected with nearly every character in some way, and they all seem to open up to him throughout the novel in one way or another.

==Plot summary==

===Chapter I: Joe===
In the first chapter, Joe is introduced as a disenfranchised twenty-year-old youth who is enrolled at the University of California during the Vietnam War. After Joe realizes that with his grades he is going to get drafted, he hitchhikes to Yale University, where he gets the name of a professor who may be able to get him across the border into Canada. After being referred to a woman in Boston named Gretchen, she helps him get into Canada, and he eventually goes to Torremolinos, Spain. While looking for a job and a place to stay, he takes over the ownership of a bar called The Alamo, and a man named Jean-Victor finds him a place to stay in Torremolinos.

===Chapter II: Britta===
In keeping with the theme throughout the book, the second chapter is about the character Britta, an 18-year-old girl from Tromsø, Norway. After finishing school, she finds a job in an office at the docks, but eventually becomes curious about the world beyond Tromsø, and goes to vacation in Torremolinos, Spain for fifteen days. Once in Torremolinos, she loves it and finds a job as a waitress in a bar called The Alamo. Here, a man named Jean-Victor finds her a place to stay, where another newcomer to Torremolinos, Joe, is already staying.

===Chapter III: Monica===
Of the main characters in the book, Monica goes through trials and tribulations as she transitions from living as royalty in a foreign country to being forced out and finally finding her way to Torremolinos to join the rest of the cast in the book. She is introduced as living with her father in the Republic of Vwarda, where Monica becomes rebellious and begins to cause a stir in Vwarda&#x27;s Royal Family. She is forced out of the country and runs away with an airline pilot to Torremolinos, where she can live on her monthly allowance from her grandmother. She meets a man named Jean-Victor, who finds her a place to live with a woman from Norway and a man from the United States.

===Chapter IV: Cato===
The fourth character of the book is Cato; he is introduced as the son of the Reverend Claypool Jackson, a local minister in the area trying to salvage his community through his church. Cato Jackson is a sophomore at University of Pennsylvania, whom the narrator meets at a drugstore where he stumbles upon a shooting of a local drugstore owner. After meeting Mr. Fairbanks, he and Cato talk all night and the next day, after Cato&#x27;s girlfriend is stabbed and killed. Cato then runs off to Torremolinos, where he finds shelter in an apartment with a few other runaways of his own age.

===Chapter V: Yigal===
In the fifth chapter of the book, the character Yigal is introduced as the son of a dean at a college in Haifa, Israel. He is struggling to identify with either his parents and their life in Israel, or with his grandfather and his American life in Detroit, Michigan in the United States, and his other grandfather in England. He is shuffled between Israel and America throughout his youth, and even fights and becomes a hero in the Six-Day War, before finally enrolling in Technion University in Haifa. After a few months he moves back to England with his other grandfather and begins to engage in a lot of reading and in conversations with his grandfather. Eventually his grandfather suggests that he needs to spend some time away, and he suggests the south of Spain, and Torremolinos, as a place to go.

===Chapter VI: Gretchen===
Gretchen is introduced as a very intelligent girl from Boston who, at the age of 19, has already completed her bachelor&#x27;s degree, and is working for senator Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s presidential campaign. After campaigning across the United States for McCarthy&#x27;s nomination in Chicago at the Democratic Convention, during the riots she and the people she is with are falsely arrested. During the process she is sexually assaulted, but the policemen who did it deny it, and nothing is ever done about it. After fighting with her parents and the police over the issue of what happened, she decides to go to school in Besançon, France, where one of her professors tells her about an excellent language school. Upon enrolling at the University of Besançon and living with her peers for a little while, she decides to travel. Someone suggests Torremolinos, so she buys a yellow pop-top van and begins to live out of it in Torremolinos.

===Chapter VII: Torremolinos===
At the beginning of chapter seven, the whole set of characters are all in Torremolinos, and everyone is getting settled in with their various living conditions. Cato and Monica begin a relationship, and some of the characters begin to experiment with drugs such as LSD; they continue to smoke large amounts of marijuana and drink regularly. During this time, they go to Paxton Fell&#x27;s house, a man whom a few of the characters were referenced to see in case of an emergency. Everyone, including Mr. Fairbanks, who is in Torremolinos to supervise a real estate deal, end up partying with Mr. Fell and a few of his guests throughout the night. Eventually, during their stay, the characters are approached by a woman, Susan Elgerton, who tries to convince Cato and Gretchen to join her in the name of starting a violent revolution back in America. As time goes on, Torremolinos begins to lose its luster; Monica is partying too much for her own good and Gretchen starts to look for something else to entertain her, and the characters leave Torremolinos in Gretchen&#x27;s yellow pop-top and head towards Portugal.

===Chapter VIII: Algarve===
As they drive towards the Algarve, the characters begin to notice that not everywhere in Europe is so nice as Torremolinos. They eventually find a small town by the name of Alte. Here, Yigal meets a local girl whom he kisses, upsetting the rest of the village, and Monica and Cato keep on going to the nearby town of Albufeira to take doses of LSD with a local bar owner, where Gretchen also tries it for the first time and unfortunately has a really bad trip. Eventually the group moves on to the seaside town of Algarve. After living in Algarve for a while, Monica tries to run away to Nepal, but Joe, Yigal and Cato end up getting into a fight with the people with whom she was going to run away. She returns, and the crew heads off to Pamplona, Spain with Mr. Fairbanks.

===Chapter IX: The Tech Rep===
In the ninth chapter, a new character is introduced by the name of Harvey Holt. He works as a technical representative on radars in remote locations. He is an old friend of Mr. Fairbanks, and has been everywhere; from Afghanistan to Sumatra to Thailand. He is a fan of old music and movies. He is very old-fashioned, and in a break from the rest of the characters in the book, he isn&#x27;t vehemently anti-war, as he had served in World War II. He very much disapproves of how Joe dodged the draft to travel the world. Harvey&#x27;s old music tapes include the vocalist Bea Wain; her recording of &quot;My Reverie&quot;, discussed in two separate chapters, serves as a symbol of the generation gap.

===Chapter X: Pamplona===
Pamplona is known for its Running of the Bulls, an event characters come to see. They stay in the same hotel as Mr. Fairbanks and Harvey Holt, and there are many conversations between Mr. Holt and Joe about commitment to one&#x27;s country. Here, Gretchen starts to show her feelings for Clive, a recurring character throughout the book who brings news from the outside world as well as new music from his homeland in England. For a week, everybody enjoys themselves, and Joe begins to think that he also wants to run with the bulls with Harvey at some point. During the week, Yigal&#x27;s American grandfather tracks him down and tries to bring him back to Detroit with him, although he is torn because he doesn&#x27;t like America, although something in it still has him interested. In the end, he leaves to go to school at Case Western Reserve in Ohio. During the run, Harvey gets gored by a bull but survives. Joe and even Mr. Fairbanks run, and the gang decides next to leave Europe and head to Mozambique for the next leg of their journey.

===Chapter XI: Mozambique===
In Mozambique things begin to go downhill for Monica: she has moved beyond LSD, begins to use heroin regularly, starts to bring Cato down with her, and gets Joe to try heroin on occasion. Cato hangs around the local historians in the area, and begins to learn about the history of Africa, and the effect slavery has had on the continent. As quick as Cato is to point out how badly the Christians have treated the Arabs, Mr. Fairbanks and Gretchen are quick to point out how much the Arabs used slavery against their own people in the past. The group also explores some of the natural beauty of Mozambique, and starts to reconnect with that side of the world, which is something they have not explored thus far on their journey. The group then decides to head to Marrakesh, Morocco, where there is a man who could help out Joe with some papers, so he could re-enter the United States at some point, and not be considered a criminal.

===Chapter XII: Marrakesh===
In the final destination of the journey, the remainder of the group ends up in Marrakesh, Morocco, where the marijuana trade is booming, a town where young people could get lost very easily. The group finds a place to stay at a hotel, where on the top floor there is a man who can help out Joe with his papers, and helps out people who become addicted to heroin, which makes it a good fit for Monica. Monica is becoming more addicted to heroin, and things are starting to look bad for her. Her father has all but given up hope for her, and the rest of the group is beginning to split up; Britta and Harvey fly off to Ratmalana, and Monica runs away more often than before. Eventually, Monica dies from an infection caused by her heroin use, Britta leaves with Harvey, Cato begins his trip to Mecca hoping to return to Philadelphia, Joe goes off to Tokyo and Gretchen returns home to Boston.

== Reception ==
The book was a commercial success, ranking as one of the ten best-selling novels of 1971.

The New York Times&#x27; book critic Thomas Lask found the novel superficial and lacking in character insight, stating that Michener &quot;...is not investigating the states of mind of those suffering from existential anxiety, of those fundamentally alienated from the world. He is setting down the log of a number of people who think they may be able to solve some problems by postponing consideration of them...those interested in knowing how a sympathetic member of the older generation views some of the shenanigans of the younger will find “The Drifters” a tolerable interlude, especially as it is spiced with travelogue evocations of foreign climes.&quot;

A review in The Hartford Courant stated that &quot;Overall, Michener has produced a fine work, a lively and entertaining examination of the New Society&#x27;s would-be solutions to old society problems&quot;, while noting that &quot;the drifters never launch into meaningless diatribes against society, as expatriates are wont to do...instead, they fly into carefully controlled rages, which at times seem highly unrealistic.&quot;

<text>Bamfield is a community that is surrounded by Crown Land, First Nation Lands belonging to the Huu-ay-aht Nations, and portions of the Pacific Rim National Park, located on Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. The community, with a population of 179 as of 2016, is divided by Bamfield Inlet.

== History ==

Bamfield was populated by Huu-ay-aht of the Nuu-chah-nulth, the local Indigenous people. Europeans founded a small fishing community sometime in the late 1800s. Most of the Indigenous people now live in the neighbouring village of Anacla about 5 kilometres from Bamfield.

Bamfield was named after the first government agent of the area, William Eddy Banfield. The name &quot;Bamfield&quot; with an &quot;m&quot; is said to have occurred either because of how the Huu-ay-aht had pronounced the agent&#x27;s name, or it was a mistake made by the postal organization. In 1902, the Bamfield cable station was constructed as the western terminus of a worldwide undersea telegraph cable called the All Red Line by some, as it passed only through countries and territories controlled by the British Empire, which were coloured red on maps of the time. The cable initially went to Fanning Island, a tiny coral atoll in the mid-Pacific, and from there continued to Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia. On May 16, 1915, American newspapers reported that an enemy Demo team had tried to land at Bamfield but was scared off by the military guards.

A second building, made of concrete, was built on the site in 1926 to replace the old wood structure. This building, designated a historic site in 1930, is now used by the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. During the early years of World War II, Cable &amp; Wireless&#x27; cable station was shelled by an Imperial Japanese Navy submarine from nearby Barkley Sound without any major damage being inflicted, however the Canadian Government arranged for a company of troops to be based there until the end of that conflict.

A Marine and Fisheries lifesaving station on the Pacific coast was established at Bamfield in 1907.
It was the first lifesaving station on Canada&#x27;s Pacific Coast.

In 1953 the cable was extended up the Alberni Inlet to Port Alberni and the local station was closed on June 20, 1959. Following the closure, only the large concrete building, two cable storage tanks and an adjacent building survived, as all the rest were demolished.


In 1968, the National Research Council asked five western Canadian universities (University of British Columbia, University of Victoria, University of Calgary, University of Alberta and Simon Fraser University) to propose the best location for a marine biology station on the Pacific Coast. Although Victoria was the earlier winner, a feasibility study tendered in 1969 recommended Bamfield as the better location. The former cable station property was purchased in 1969 and a formal structure for the management and development of the station was created in 1970 when the five universities ratified a Constitution and joined the Western Canadian Universities Marine Biological Society. In 1971, development began to convert the site into a research station. With most of the physical facilities completed, the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre began operations by the end of 1972. It became the largest employer in the community since. Commercial fishing was based in Bamfield up to the mid-1980s. Bamfield is now home to several sport fishing lodges, which pursue primarily salmon and halibut. Bamfield is also the northern terminus of the West Coast Trail, a hiking trail built in 1907 along the west coast of Vancouver Island to help survivors of the area&#x27;s many shipwrecks find their way back to civilization. The trail runs along extremely rugged terrain.

Today Bamfield is primarily a tourist destination, either for the West Coast Trail, ocean kayaking or sport fishing. The research activities at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre attracts hundreds of researchers every year. The Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre also offers credited university courses through its five associated universities. An out reach program, which provides multi-day immersion field trips for school, college and adult learners, also bring thousands of visitors to the community every year.

The town is featured in the first episode of CBC Television&#x27;s 2015 comedy/reality series &quot;Still Standing&quot;.

<text>Kolbuszowa () is a small town in south-eastern Poland, with 9,190 inhabitants 
Situated in the Sandomierz Forest in the Subcarpathian Voivodship, it is the capital of Kolbuszowa County. Kolbuszowa belongs to historic Lesser Poland, near its border with another historic region, Czerwień Cities/Red Ruthenia.

==History==

The name of the town comes from the land owner Kolbusz. It appeared for the first time in 1503 in place where Poręby Wielkie used to exist. The town, which administratively belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province, was probably founded before 1683, when it was mentioned in a trade regulating document of Józef Karol Lubomirski. Kolbuszowa was located on an important trade route from Sandomierz to Przemyśl. As the owners of the area were the Leliwa Tarnowski, Kolbuszowa belonged to Sandomierz County. With regard to the Roman Catholic Church, Kolbuszowa was within the diocese of Kraków, but in 1786 it was moved under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Tarnów.

Following the late-18th-century partitions of Poland the town was in the Rzeszów district of the Austrian Galicia and in 1867 it became the seat of its own county (powiat). Before World War II, half of Kolbuszowa&#x27;s population was Jewish. The coat of arms of the city features a Christian cross and a Star of David with hands shaking between them to symbolize the friendship between Jewish and Christian Poles in Kolbuszowa.

During the German invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, on September 9, 1939, a 2-day battle between the Polish Army (121st light tank company) and the German 2nd Panzer Division took place here.

During the war, German troops burned down part of the town and about half of the Jewish population perished. In September 1941 Germans established a ghetto and interned 2,500 people. In September 1942 the ghetto was emptied and its entire population was moved to a ghetto in Rzeszów.

During the war units of Polish Armia Krajowa (AK) and BCh (Polish Peasants&#x27; Battalions) operating in this area discovered testing sites for the German V-1 and V-2 rockets in the nearby towns of Blizna/Pustkow. The Red Army entered Kolubuszowa in July 1944 and local Polish AK units (as part of Operation Tempest) attacked retreating German units; several dozen partisans died in the operation.

After World War II, Kolbuszowa was rebuilt. New school districts were created, as well as a library and Museum of Culture. In 1964, a new rail link was established: Rzeszów – Głogów Małopolski – Kolbuszowa. In 1971, it was extended to Nowa Dęba and Tarnobrzeg. This connected Kolbuszowa to all the major cities in Poland including the capital, Warsaw. It was a culmination of decades of preparations which started when this part of Poland was under the control of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

==In popular culture==
The 2023 Netflix series &quot;1670&quot; was filmed in the open-air in Kolbuszowa.

==Notable people==

* Agnieszka Machówna (1648–1681), Polish fraudster and bigamist.

* Jan Bytnar (1921–1943), Polish Scoutmaster and Scouting resistance activist and Second Lieutenant of Armia Krajowa.
* Marian Krzaklewski (born 1950), Polish politician and former presidential candidate, was born in Kolbuszowa.
* Hadassah (née Bluth) and Eliezer Birnbaum (parents of American comedian/actor George Burns).

<text>Adderall and Mydayis are trade names for a combination drug containing four salts of amphetamine. The mixture is composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which produces a (3:1) ratio between dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, the two enantiomers of amphetamine. Both enantiomers are stimulants, but differ enough to give Adderall an effects profile distinct from those of racemic amphetamine or dextroamphetamine, which are marketed as Evekeo and Dexedrine/Zenzedi, respectively. Adderall is indicated in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is also used illicitly as an athletic performance enhancer, cognitive enhancer, appetite suppressant, and recreationally as a euphoriant. It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine class.

At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in sex drive, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, provoke panic attacks, or induce psychosis (e.g., paranoia, delusions, hallucinations). The side effects vary widely among individuals but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, loss of appetite and weight loss. The risk of developing an addiction or dependence is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed and at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD. However, the routine use of Adderall in larger and daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction or dependence due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and also carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.

The two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall, such as Adderall tablets/capsules (levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine), alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, which results in part from their interactions with human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (hTAAR1) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in neurons. Dextroamphetamine is a more potent central nervous system () stimulant than levoamphetamine, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects and a longer elimination half-life than dextroamphetamine. The levoamphetamine component of Adderall has been reported to improve the treatment response in some individuals relative to dextroamphetamine alone. The active ingredient in Adderall, amphetamine, shares many chemical and pharmacological properties with the human trace amines, particularly phenethylamine and , the latter of which is a positional isomer of amphetamine. In 2022, Adderall was the fourteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 34million prescriptions.
==Uses==
===Medical===
Adderall is commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy (a sleep disorder).

====ADHD====

====Narcolepsy====

====Available forms====
Adderall is available as immediate-release (IR) tablets and extended-release (XR) capsules. Mydayis is only available as an extended-release formulation. Adderall XR is approved to treat ADHD for up to 12 hours in individuals 6 years and older and uses a double-bead formulation. The capsule can be swallowed like a tablet, or it can be opened and the beads sprinkled over applesauce for comparable absorption. Upon ingestion, half of the beads provide immediate administration of medication, while the other half are enveloped in a coating that must dissolve, delaying absorption of its contents. It is designed to provide a therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations identical to taking two doses of Adderall IR four hours apart. Mydayis uses a longer-lasting triple-bead formulation and is approved to treat ADHD for up to 16 hours in individuals 13 years and older. In the United States, the immediate and extended-release formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs. Generic formulations of Mydayis became available in the US in October 2023.

===Enhancing performance===

Adderall has been banned in the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). In leagues such as the NFL, there is a very rigorous process required to obtain an exemption to this rule even when the athlete has been medically prescribed the drug by their physician.

===Recreational===
Adderall has a high potential for misuse as a recreational drug. Adderall tablets can either be swallowed, crushed and snorted, or dissolved in water and injected. Injection into the bloodstream can be dangerous because insoluble fillers within the tablets can block small blood vessels.

Many postsecondary students have reported using Adderall for study purposes in different parts of the developed world. Among these students, some of the risk factors for misusing ADHD stimulants recreationally include: possessing deviant personality characteristics (i.e., exhibiting delinquent or deviant behavior), inadequate accommodation of disability, basing one&#x27;s self-worth on external validation, low self-efficacy, earning poor grades, and having an untreated mental health disorder.

==Contraindications==
==Adverse effects==

The adverse side effects of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of substance consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of serious adverse drug effects than dosages used for therapeutic purposes.
==Overdose==
==Interactions==
* Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) taken with amphetamine may result in a hypertensive crisis if taken within two weeks after last use of an MAOI type drug.
* Inhibitors of enzymes that directly metabolize amphetamine (particularly CYP2D6 and FMO3) will prolong the elimination of amphetamine and increase drug effects.
* Serotonergic drugs (such as most antidepressants) co-administered with amphetamine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.
* Stimulants and antidepressants (sedatives and depressants) may increase (decrease) the drug effects of amphetamine, and vice versa.
* Gastrointestinal and urinary pH affect the absorption and elimination of amphetamine, respectively. Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents increase the absorption of amphetamine. Urinary alkalinizing agents increase the concentration of non-ionized species, decreasing urinary excretion.
* Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) modify the absorption of Adderall XR and Mydayis.
* Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of ADHD.
* Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) like atomoxetine prevent norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and have been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===

Amphetamine, the active ingredient of Adderall, works primarily by increasing the activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It also triggers the release of several other hormones (e.g., epinephrine) and neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin and histamine) as well as the synthesis of certain neuropeptides (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptides). Both active ingredients of Adderall, dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, bind to the same biological targets, but their binding affinities (that is, potency) differ somewhat. Dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are both potent full agonists (activating compounds) of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and interact with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), with dextroamphetamine being the more potent agonist of TAAR1. Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces more stimulation than levoamphetamine; however, levoamphetamine has slightly greater cardiovascular and peripheral effects. It has been reported that certain children have a better clinical response to levoamphetamine.

In the absence of amphetamine, will normally move monoamines (e.g., dopamine, histamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, etc.) from the intracellular fluid of a monoamine neuron into its synaptic vesicles, which store neurotransmitters for later release (via exocytosis) into the synaptic cleft. When amphetamine enters a neuron and interacts with VMAT2, the transporter reverses its direction of transport, thereby releasing stored monoamines inside synaptic vesicles back into the neuron&#x27;s intracellular fluid. Meanwhile, when amphetamine activates , the receptor causes the neuron&#x27;s cell membrane-bound monoamine transporters (i.e., the dopamine transporter, norepinephrine transporter, or serotonin transporter) to either stop transporting monoamines altogether (via transporter internalization) or transport monoamines out of the neuron; in other words, the reversed membrane transporter will push dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin out of the neuron&#x27;s intracellular fluid and into the synaptic cleft. In summary, by interacting with both VMAT2 and TAAR1, amphetamine releases neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles (the effect from VMAT2) into the intracellular fluid where they subsequently exit the neuron through the membrane-bound, reversed monoamine transporters (the effect from TAAR1).

== History ==
The pharmaceutical company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug Obetrol following its mandatory withdrawal from the market in 1973 under the Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act due to the results of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program (which indicated a lack of efficacy). The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components of the same weight (the other two original dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it lacking FDA approval, it still made it onto the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for many years.

In 1994, Richwood Pharmaceuticals acquired Rexar and began promoting Obetrol as a treatment for ADHD (and later narcolepsy as well), now marketed under the new brand name of Adderall, a contraction of the phrase &quot;A.D.D. for All&quot; intended to convey that &quot;it was meant to be kind of an inclusive thing&quot; for marketing purposes. The FDA cited the company for numerous significant CGMP violations related to Obetrol discovered during routine inspections following the acquisition (including issuing a formal warning letter for the violations), then later issued a second formal warning letter to Richwood Pharmaceuticals specifically due to violations of &quot;the new drug and misbranding provisions of the FD&amp;C Act&quot;. Following extended discussions with Richwood Pharmaceuticals regarding the resolution of a large number of issues related to the company&#x27;s numerous violations of FDA regulations, the FDA formally approved the first Obetrol labeling/sNDA revisions in 1996, including a name change to Adderall and a restoration of its status as an approved drug product. In 1997 Richwood Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals in a $186 million transaction.

Richwood Pharmaceuticals, which later merged with Shire plc, introduced the current Adderall brand in 1996 as an instant-release tablet. In 2006, Shire agreed to sell rights to the Adderall name for the instant-release form of the medication to Duramed Pharmaceuticals. DuraMed Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2008 during their acquisition of Barr Pharmaceuticals, including Barr&#x27;s Duramed division.

The first generic version of Adderall IR was introduced to the market in 2002. Later on, Barr and Shire reached a settlement agreement permitting Barr to offer a generic form of the extended-release drug beginning in April 2009.

===Commercial formulation===
Chemically, Adderall is a mixture of four amphetamine salts; specifically, it is composed of equal parts (by mass) of amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and dextroamphetamine saccharate. This drug mixture has slightly stronger effects than racemic amphetamine due to the higher proportion of dextroamphetamine. Adderall is produced as both an immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (XR) formulation. , ten different companies produced generic Adderall IR, while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Actavis, and Barr Pharmaceuticals manufactured generic Adderall XR. , Shire plc, the company that held the original patent for Adderall and Adderall XR, still manufactured brand name Adderall XR, but not Adderall IR.

===Comparison to other formulations===
Adderall is one of several formulations of pharmaceutical amphetamine, including singular or mixed enantiomers and as an enantiomer prodrug. The table below compares these medications (based on U.S.-approved forms):
== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
* In Canada, amphetamines are in Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and can only be obtained by prescription.
* In Japan, the use, production, and import of any medicine containing amphetamines is prohibited.
* In South Korea, amphetamines are prohibited.
* In Taiwan, amphetamines including Adderall are Schedule 2 drugs with a minimum five-year prison term for possession. On the contrary, Ritalin can be legally prescribed as a form of treatment of ADHD.
* In Thailand, amphetamines are classified as Type 1 Narcotics.
* In the United Kingdom, amphetamines are regarded as Class B drugs. The maximum penalty for unauthorized possession is five years in prison and an unlimited fine. The maximum penalty for illegal supply is 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine.
* In the United States, amphetamine is a Schedule II prescription drug, classified as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.
* Internationally, amphetamine is in Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

=== Shortages ===
In February 2023, news organizations began reporting on shortages of Adderall in the United States that have lasted for over five months. The Food and Drug Administration first reported the shortage in October 2022. In May 2023, seven months into the shortage, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner Robert Califf stated that &quot;a number of generic drugs are in shortage at any given time because there&#x27;s not enough profit&quot;. He points out that Adderall is a special case because it is a controlled substance and the amount available for prescription is controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration. He also faults a &quot;tremendous increase in prescribing&quot; due to virtual prescribing and general overprescribing and overdiagnosing, adding that &quot;if only the people that needed these drugs got them, there probably wouldn&#x27;t be a [stimulant medication] shortage&quot;. The shortage has continued into 2024. It has led to the creation and expansion of businesses that outsource the search for Adderall. One company charges $50 per U.S. customer to hire workers in the Philippines or another country to make phone calls to all the pharmacies located near the customer and check whether they have any Adderall. Celebrity endorsements have contributed to the increased demand for Adderall.

<text>Vonda Shepard (born July 7, 1963) is an American singer, songwriter, music director, and actress. She is perhaps best known for her starring role as a fictionalized version of herself on the television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (1997–2002), for which she recorded five soundtrack albums as well as the series&#x27; theme song &quot;Searchin&#x27; My Soul&quot;, which saw international commercial success. Shepard has otherwise released nine studio albums and three live albums. She received a Screen Actors Guild Award as a cast member of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; in 1999 among two additional nominations, and received a &quot;Billboard&quot; award for selling the most television soundtrack albums in history.

==Life and career==
Vonda Shepard was born in New York City in 1963. Her family relocated to California when she was a child, and she played piano from an early age. Her father was Richmond Shepard, a mime and improvisational actor. She has three sisters. After performing as a backup singer, Shepard received her own recording contract and made her first chart appearance in 1987 with her duet with Dan Hill, &quot;Can&#x27;t We Try.&quot; Her self-titled debut studio album followed in 1989. It saw the moderate commercial success of the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Ilene&quot;, which peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary chart and remained there for 12 weeks.

While promoting her third studio album &quot;It&#x27;s Good, Eve&quot; (1996), Shepard performed at the Key Club in Hollywood, California, and at one point she invited Michelle Pfeiffer and her husband David E. Kelley to come watch her perform. Kelley decided during the performance that he wanted Shepard to record the soundtrack for his forthcoming television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, having been looking for a singer to be the voice and inner thoughts of the character. Her biggest commercial success while starring on the series was the theme song &quot;Searchin&#x27; My Soul&quot;, an original selection that originally appeared on her second studio album &quot;The Radical Light&quot; (1992), jointly written and composed by Shepard and Paul Howard Gordon. Her version of Kay Starr&#x27;s Christmas classic &quot;(Everybody&#x27;s Waitin&#x27; for) The Man with the Bag&quot;, after it was featured on a season 4 episode of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, became a popular holiday song. 

Shepard went on to record four soundtrack albums and one compilation album for &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Additionally, she released nine solo studio albums and three live albums to date. She married music producer Mitchell Froom in 2004; they had their first child in 2006. In 2010, she provided vocals for &quot;I Need You,&quot; whose music had been composed by James Newton Howard, for the film &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot;.

<text>Strzyżów is a town in Strzyżów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, Poland, along the Wisłok river valley. Strzyżów is one of the towns within the Strzyżowsko-Dynowskie Foothill, located south-east of Kraków and 30 km from Rzeszów. According to statistics from 30 June 2010 from GUS (the Central Statistical Office in Poland), there are 8,782 inhabitants.

==History==
The history of Strzyżów dates back to the 9th century, to the times of the Wiślanie tribe (Vistulans) when a legendary pagan Vistulan prince is said to have built a watchtower by Stobnica and Wisłok river called &quot;Strzeżno&quot;, for the defence of eastern borders of his land. In 1279, in Buda (Hungary), the Pope&#x27;s legate named Bishop Philip confirmed the abbot&#x27;s right to take a special tax (a tithe) from Czudec and Strzyżów.

Strzyżów obtained city rights between 1373 and 1397. The town was surrounded by a soil defence embankment (Zawale Street still exists and it relates to that embankment). These were the times of town splendour and its development, craft, farming and trade contracts with other towns in what is now Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. In 1373, Strzyżów came into the hands of a knight, Wojtko, and later Pakosz and his sons Jan and Mikołaj. With time the town changed its owners. On 15 August 1769 the Bar Confederates made an oath in front of the painting of Immaculate Mary in Strzyżów, in the presence of Casimir Pulaski and Franciszek Trzecielski. After this event, that image appeared on the Confederates’ Banner. In 1796 the foundation of secular school strengthened town development as well as royal permission for organisation of four fairs a year from 1684. Following the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, the town became part of Austrian Galicia.

Throughout its history Strzyżów suffered from as many as nine fires, the last one in 1895 caused the populace to build buildings solely from brick. By 1880 Strzyżów was inhabited mostly by Poles, but there were also significant minorities such as the Jews and the Germans. In 1918, the town returned to Poland (Second Polish Republic), within which it was a county seat in the Lwów Voivodeship. In 1925, town limits were expanded by including Przedmieście Strzyżowskie (former suburb). Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany until 1944. The 1960s and 1970s gave beginning to industrialisation; many factories, companies, schools and cultural centres were founded in the town&#x27;s vicinity.

<doc id="649115" wikidata="Q3045793" url="?curid=649115" title="E7 (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, E7 is the name of several closely related Lie groups, linear algebraic groups or their Lie algebras e7, all of which have dimension 133; the same notation E7 is used for the corresponding root lattice, which has rank 7. The designation E7 comes from the Cartan–Killing classification of the complex simple Lie algebras, which fall into four infinite series labeled A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot;, D&quot;n&quot;, and five exceptional cases labeled E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2. The E7 algebra is thus one of the five exceptional cases.

The fundamental group of the (adjoint) complex form, compact real form, or any algebraic version of E7 is the cyclic group Z/2Z, and its outer automorphism group is the trivial group. The dimension of its fundamental representation is 56.

==Real and complex forms==
There is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E7, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 133. The complex adjoint Lie group E7 of complex dimension 133 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 266. This has fundamental group Z/2Z, has maximal compact subgroup the compact form (see below) of E7, and has an outer automorphism group of order 2 generated by complex conjugation.

As well as the complex Lie group of type E7, there are four real forms of the Lie algebra, and correspondingly four real forms of the group with trivial center (all of which have an algebraic double cover, and three of which have further non-algebraic covers, giving further real forms), all of real dimension 133, as follows:
* The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which has fundamental group Z/2Z and has trivial outer automorphism group.
* The split form, EV (or E7(7)), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(8)/{±1}, fundamental group cyclic of order 4 and outer automorphism group of order 2.
* EVI (or E7(-5)), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(2)·SO(12)/(center), fundamental group non-cyclic of order 4 and trivial outer automorphism group.
* EVII (or E7(-25)), which has maximal compact subgroup SO(2)·E6/(center), infinite cyclic fundamental group and outer automorphism group of order 2.

For a complete list of real forms of simple Lie algebras, see the list of simple Lie groups.

The compact real form of E7 is the isometry group of the 64-dimensional exceptional compact Riemannian symmetric space EVI (in Cartan&#x27;s classification). It is known informally as the &quot;&quot; because it can be built using an algebra that is the tensor product of the quaternions and the octonions, and is also known as a Rosenfeld projective plane, though it does not obey the usual axioms of a projective plane. This can be seen systematically using a construction known as the &quot;magic square&quot;, due to Hans Freudenthal and Jacques Tits.

The algebraic double cover of the complex form, or of the split real form, or of EVII can be described as the automorphism group of a Freudenthal triple system, which is a special kind of triple system defined on a 56-dimensional vector space.

The Tits–Koecher construction produces forms of the E7 Lie algebra from Albert algebras, 27-dimensional exceptional Jordan algebras.

==E7 as an algebraic group==
By means of a Chevalley basis for the Lie algebra, one can define E7 as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as &quot;untwisted&quot;) adjoint form of E7. Over an algebraically closed field, this and its double cover are the only forms; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or &quot;twists&quot; of E7, which are classified in the general framework of Galois cohomology (over a perfect field &quot;k&quot;) by the set &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;, Aut(E7)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E7 (see below) has no automorphisms, coincides with &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;, E7, ad).

Over the field of real numbers, the real component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E7 coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned above, but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all adjoint forms of E7 have fundamental group Z/2Z in the sense of algebraic geometry, meaning that they admit exactly one double cover; the further non-compact real Lie group forms of E7 are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations.

Over finite fields, the Lang–Steinberg theorem implies that &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;, E7) = 0, meaning that E7 has no twisted forms: see below.

==Algebra==

===Dynkin diagram===
The Dynkin diagram for E7 is given by .

===Root system===


Even though the roots span a 7-dimensional space, it is more symmetric and convenient to represent them as vectors lying in a 7-dimensional subspace of an 8-dimensional vector space.

The roots are all the 8×7 permutations of (1,−1,0,0,0,0,0,0) and all the formula_1 permutations of (,,−,−,−,−)

Note that the 7-dimensional subspace is the subspace where the sum of all the eight coordinates is zero. There are 126 roots.

The simple roots are
:(0,−1,1,0,0,0,0,0)
:(0,0,−1,1,0,0,0,0)
:(0,0,0,−1,1,0,0,0)
:(0,0,0,0,−1,1,0,0)
:(0,0,0,0,0,−1,1,0)
:(0,0,0,0,0,0,−1,1)

They are listed so that their corresponding nodes in the Dynkin diagram are ordered from left to right (in the diagram depicted above) with the side node last.

====An alternative description====
An alternative (7-dimensional) description of the root system, which is useful in considering as a subgroup of E8, is the following:

All formula_2 permutations of (±1,±1,0,0,0,0,0) preserving the zero at the last entry, all of the following roots with an even number of +

:formula_3

and the two following roots

:formula_4

Thus the generators consist of a 66-dimensional so(12) subalgebra as well as 64 generators that transform as two self-conjugate Weyl spinors of spin(12) of opposite chirality, and their chirality generator, and two other generators of chiralities formula_5.

Given the E7 Cartan matrix (below) and a Dynkin diagram node ordering of: 

:one choice of simple roots is given by the rows of the following matrix:
:formula_6
===Weyl group===
The Weyl group of E7 is of order 2903040: it is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the unique simple group of order 1451520 (which can be described as PSp6(2) or PSΩ7(2)).

===Cartan matrix===
:formula_7

==Important subalgebras and representations==

E7 has an SU(8) subalgebra, as is evident by noting that in the 8-dimensional description of the root system, the first group of roots are identical to the roots of SU(8) (with the same Cartan subalgebra as in the E7).

In addition to the 133-dimensional adjoint representation, there is a 56-dimensional &quot;vector&quot; representation, to be found in the E8 adjoint representation.

The characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the Weyl character formula. The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are :

:1, 56, 133, 912, 1463, 1539, 6480, 7371, 8645, 24320, 27664, 40755, 51072, 86184, 150822, 152152, 238602, 253935, 293930, 320112, 362880, 365750, 573440, 617253, 861840, 885248, 915705, 980343, 2273920, 2282280, 2785552, 3424256, 3635840...

The underlined terms in the sequence above are the dimensions of those irreducible representations possessed by the adjoint form of E7 (equivalently, those whose weights belong to the root lattice of E7), whereas the full sequence gives the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the simply connected form of E7. There exist non-isomorphic irreducible representation of dimensions 1903725824, 16349520330, etc.

The fundamental representations are those with dimensions 133, 8645, 365750, 27664, 1539, 56 and 912 (corresponding to the seven nodes in the Dynkin diagram in the order chosen for the Cartan matrix above, i.e., the nodes are read in the six-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the third).

The embeddings of the maximal subgroups of E7 up to dimension 133 are shown to the right.

===E7 Polynomial Invariants===
E7 is the automorphism group of the following pair of polynomials in 56 non-commutative variables. We divide the variables into two groups of 28, (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) and (&quot;q&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are real variables and &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are 3×3 octonion hermitian matrices. Then the first invariant is the symplectic invariant of Sp(56, R):

:formula_8

The second more complicated invariant is a symmetric quartic polynomial:

:formula_9

Where formula_10 and the binary circle operator is defined by formula_11.

An alternative quartic polynomial invariant constructed by Cartan uses two anti-symmetric 8x8 matrices each with 28 components.

:formula_12

==Chevalley groups of type E7==
The points over a finite field with &quot;q&quot; elements of the (split) algebraic group E7 (see above), whether of the adjoint (centerless) or simply connected form (its algebraic universal cover), give a finite Chevalley group. This is closely connected to the group written E7(&quot;q&quot;), however there is ambiguity in this notation, which can stand for several things:

* the finite group consisting of the points over F&quot;q&quot; of the simply connected form of E7 (for clarity, this can be written E7,sc(&quot;q&quot;) and is known as the &quot;universal&quot; Chevalley group of type E7 over F&quot;q&quot;),
* (rarely) the finite group consisting of the points over F&quot;q&quot; of the adjoint form of E7 (for clarity, this can be written E7,ad(&quot;q&quot;), and is known as the &quot;adjoint&quot; Chevalley group of type E7 over F&quot;q&quot;), or
* the finite group which is the image of the natural map from the former to the latter: this is what will be denoted by E7(&quot;q&quot;) in the following, as is most common in texts dealing with finite groups.

From the finite group perspective, the relation between these three groups, which is quite analogous to that between SL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), PGL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) and PSL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), can be summarized as follows: E7(&quot;q&quot;) is simple for any &quot;q&quot;, E7,sc(&quot;q&quot;) is its Schur cover, and the E7,ad(&quot;q&quot;) lies in its automorphism group; furthermore, when &quot;q&quot; is a power of 2, all three coincide, and otherwise (when &quot;q&quot; is odd), the Schur multiplier of E7(&quot;q&quot;) is 2 and E7(&quot;q&quot;) is of index 2 in E7,ad(&quot;q&quot;), which explains why E7,sc(&quot;q&quot;) and E7,ad(&quot;q&quot;) are often written as 2·E7(&quot;q&quot;) and E7(&quot;q&quot;)·2. From the algebraic group perspective, it is less common for E7(&quot;q&quot;) to refer to the finite simple group, because the latter is not in a natural way the set of points of an algebraic group over F&quot;q&quot; unlike E7,sc(&quot;q&quot;) and E7,ad(&quot;q&quot;).

As mentioned above, E7(&quot;q&quot;) is simple for any &quot;q&quot;, and it constitutes one of the infinite families addressed by the classification of finite simple groups. Its number of elements is given by the formula :

:formula_13

The order of E7,sc(&quot;q&quot;) or E7,ad(&quot;q&quot;) (both are equal) can be obtained by removing the dividing factor gcd(2, &quot;q&quot;−1) . The Schur multiplier of E7(&quot;q&quot;) is gcd(2, &quot;q&quot;−1), and its outer automorphism group is the product of the diagonal automorphism group Z/gcd(2, &quot;q&quot;−1)Z (given by the action of E7,ad(&quot;q&quot;)) and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order &quot;f&quot; if &quot;q&quot; = &quot;pf&quot; where &quot;p&quot; is prime).

==Importance in physics==
&quot;N&quot; = 8 supergravity in four dimensions, which is a dimensional reduction from eleven-dimensional supergravity, admit an E7 bosonic global symmetry and an SU(8) bosonic local symmetry. The fermions are in representations of SU(8), the gauge fields are in a representation of E7, and the scalars are in a representation of both (Gravitons are singlets with respect to both). Physical states are in representations of the coset .

In string theory, E7 appears as a part of the gauge group of one of the (unstable and non-supersymmetric) versions of the heterotic string. It can also appear in the unbroken gauge group in six-dimensional compactifications of heterotic string theory, for instance on the four-dimensional surface K3.

<doc id="649120" wikidata="Q1051496" url="?curid=649120" title="Cutthroat Island">
<text>Cutthroat Island is a 1995 adventure swashbuckler film directed by Renny Harlin and written by Robert King and Marc Norman from a story by Michael Frost Beckner, James Gorman, Bruce A. Evans, and Raynold Gideon. It stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, and Frank Langella. It is a co-production among the United States, France, Germany, and Italy.

The film had a notoriously troubled and chaotic production involving multiple rewrites and recasts. Critical reactions were generally negative, and the film was one of the biggest box-office bombs in history, with losses of $147 million when adjusted for inflation. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the biggest box-office bomb of all time, and significantly reduced the bankability and Hollywood production of pirate-themed films until 2003&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. Its failure caused Carolco Pictures to cease operations.

==Plot==

In 1668 Jamaica, having escaped a trap set by authorities, Morgan Adams hunts down her paternal uncle and fellow pirate Dawg Brown after he kidnaps her father, Black Harry. Harry has one of three pieces of a map to a huge stash of gold on the remote Cutthroat Island. Dawg has another piece, having stolen it after betraying and murdering their younger brother Richard, while a fourth brother, Mordechai, has the last piece. Refusing to give his piece to Dawg, Harry escapes with his daughter&#x27;s help. Harry is fatally wounded and tells Morgan the map piece is located on his scalp before he dies.

After scalping her father for the piece, Morgan, now captain of her father&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, sets out to find the treasure. Unable to translate the map, they go to nearby Port Royal for a translator. There, they learn that a criminal being sold into slavery, a con man and thief named William Shaw, is fluent in Latin. After threatening a man determined to outbid her, Morgan wins the auction. When she is recognized from her wanted poster and barely escapes with her crew and Shaw, corrupt Governor Ainslee vows to find her after learning of the treasure&#x27;s existence. He enlists the help of John Reed, an infamous chronicler of pirates and crew member of the &quot;Morning Star&quot;.

The crew finds Mordechai in Spittlefield Harbor. Before they can learn where the second piece is, Dawg and his crew raid the harbor. A fight ensues, during which Mordechai is killed and Morgan is shot, while Shaw secretly finds the piece and keeps it to himself. After they escape on the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, Morgan collapses from her wound, but Shaw uses his limited medical knowledge to save her. The two start a romance. Morgan figures out that the words on the two map pieces, when read backwards, spell out half the coordinates to the island.

Dawg pursues the &quot;Morning Star&quot; in his own ship, the &quot;Reaper&quot;. Morgan directs hers toward a coral reef and a gale to shake her pursuers off. Shaw manages to piece together the location of Cutthroat Island with his and Morgan&#x27;s piece but is caught and thrown in the brig. During the storm, Reed secretly sends a carrier pigeon revealing their location to Ainslee. Meanwhile, most of the crew, led by the treacherous boatswain Scully, mutinies and maroons Morgan and those loyal to her in a boat. The tide takes them straight to Cutthroat Island.

As Morgan goes after the treasure, Shaw steals the last map piece from Dawg. Shaw falls into quicksand and Morgan, realizing he has the piece, frees him. Together they find the treasure, only for it to be stolen by Dawg, forcing them to jump off a cliff into the tide. After regaining consciousness, Shaw finds Reed, who leads him into a trap set by Dawg, Ainslee, and Scully, who have joined forces and intend to split the treasure. As Shaw is captured and they make their way out to sea with the gold, Morgan sneaks aboard the &quot;Morning Star&quot; and retakes it from Scully and the mutineers.

The crew then tries to sneak attack the &quot;Reaper&quot;, but Dawg counterattacks. A sea fight ensues, during which Shaw escapes and Ainslee, his men, and Reed are killed by cannon fire. Morgan boards the &quot;Reaper&quot; and blows out the ship&#x27;s bottom. She then duels Dawg while Shaw gets trapped below in rapidly rising water with the treasure. Morgan kills Dawg with a cannon and saves Shaw, forced to abandon the treasure to escape the sinking ship.

Morgan had attached a marker barrel to the treasure beforehand, allowing them to retrieve it, and the newly rich crew sets sail for Madagascar.

==Cast==

In addition, Angus Wright plays Captain Trotter (lieutenant in the film&#x27;s dialogue), while the film&#x27;s director, Renny Harlin, has an uncredited cameo as a pirate with a musket.

==Production==
===Development===

In a 2023 interview, original writers James Gorman and Michael Frost Beckner explained they had a development deal with Disney, after their Western spec script &quot;Texas Lead and Gold&quot; had created buzz in the early 1990s. Any material they created, they let Disney see first: one of them was a pirate script. Inspired by researching archives of pirate material at the Huntington Library, as well as the success of buddy action films, the pair sought to modernize the pirate genre. Among the differences from the later versions were the island being volcanic and more secret, and a backstory involving four men (including Spanish and British officers) sacking a gold shipment and hiding the treasure before being betrayed. The script would jump ahead in time, with the men now in different social positions (like the Spaniard being the Governor of Portobello) and Shaw, a more ruthless character in this version, learning of the existence of the treasure. The villain was the mysterious &quot;The Scar&quot;, hunting the men down for the map pieces. Morgan was also different, being the innocent daughter of the village doctor (the British privateer of the four men) who becomes embroiled in the adventure. Instead of being tattooed on his scalp, Morgan&#x27;s father would hide his map piece in a lullaby that he sang to her as a child.

Gorman and Frost Beckner&#x27;s version, while still an adventure with comic elements, was also much darker than the finished film. Disney development staff backed the project. At one point it was even pitched to Michael Eisner as a potential &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film, who turned it down. Gorman and Frost Beckner then presented it to Carolco Pictures, who bought it for $1.7 million.

When the film was produced, Geena Davis and director Renny Harlin were married. Harlin convinced producer Mario Kassar to cast Davis, who was until then known for light comedies, hoping it would turn her into an action-adventure star. Carolco, already deeply in debt when the film entered preproduction, initially budgeted $60 million for the project and pinned its hopes for survival on its success. To fund it, the cash-starved Carolco cancelled its only other project in production, &quot;Crusade&quot; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, costing it $13 million. Carolco also sold a $20 million interest in Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Showgirls&quot;, &quot;Last of the Dogmen&quot;, and &quot;Stargate&quot;, and aggressively marketed &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; to overseas distributors, promising them it would be a sure hit.

===Casting===
Michael Douglas originally agreed to play Shaw under two conditions: filming had to start immediately because he was available only for a limited time, and his character had to have the same amount of screen time as Davis.
Douglas eventually pulled out, claiming that Davis&#x27;s role was expanded at his character&#x27;s expense, while Davis wanted to quit when Douglas did, but was contractually obligated to finish the film.

After Douglas quit, Harlin was so preoccupied with trying to find a male lead that set construction and script work were done without his input. Consequently, Harlin did not like what he saw when shooting was set to begin, leading to expensive rebuilding and rewriting.

Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson, Jeff Bridges, Ralph Fiennes, Charlie Sheen, Michael Keaton, Tim Robbins, Daniel Day-Lewis and Gabriel Byrne all turned down the role of Shaw before Matthew Modine agreed to do the role, partly due to his experience as a fencer.

Oliver Reed was originally cast for a cameo as Mordechai Fingers, but was fired after getting in a bar fight and attempting to expose himself to Davis while intoxicated. George Murcell eventually took his place.

===Filming===

Shooting was delayed for various reasons, causing the budget to spiral out of control. When Harlin fired chief camera operator Nicola Pecorini following a dispute, more than two dozen crew members quit. In addition, broken pipes caused raw sewage to pour into the water tank where the actors were supposed to swim. Harlin spent $1 million of his own money to rewrite the script, as Carolco Pictures was in so much debt that they could not afford to pay further.

The first week into production, the film&#x27;s original cinematographer, Oliver Wood, fell off a crane and into one of the water tanks, breaking his leg; he had to be replaced by cinematographer Peter Levy. Wood&#x27;s contributions to the film would be acknowledged in the closing credits.

The film was shot on location in Malta and Thailand. Indoor scenes were shot at Mediterranean Film Studios in Kalkara, Malta, and models were shot at the Paddock Tank at Pinewood Studios, in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England. Harlin required actors to do their own stunts whenever possible. While promoting the film, Davis appeared on talk shows with clips of her doing stunts over and over (including one take where she fell out of a window too soon, rolled down the roof and under a carriage) and described the bruises and injuries she sustained while filming.

===Music===

The film&#x27;s orchestral score was composed by John Debney. It is one of the film&#x27;s aspects that has been critically acclaimed, compared with the classic works of Erich Wolfgang Korngold.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; had a total production budget of $92 million to $98 million (though some put the figure as high as $115 million). It debuted at number 13 at the US box office, and the total gross in the United States and Canada was only $10 million. Internationally, it did not fare any better and grossed $6 million, for a worldwide total of $16 million. In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time, while the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; listed it as the biggest box-office bomb of all-time. The list of biggest box-office bombs shows it is still no better (ranges vary) than the fifth worst money loser of all time, allowing for inflation, as of 2023.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; has a 40% rating based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 4.90/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; may aspire towards the earnest thrills of classic swashbucklers, but a distinct lack of charm and stilted script make this adventure a joyless hodgepodge of the pirate genre&#x27;s flotsam and jetsam.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 37% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Todd McCarthy from &quot;Variety&quot; said: &quot;What seemed like a dubious proposition on paper plays even more dubiously onscreen, as &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; strenuously but vainly attempts to revive the thrills of old-fashioned pirate pictures. Giving most of the swashbuckling opportunities to star Geena Davis, pic does little with its reversal of gender expectations and features a seriously mismatched romantic duo in Davis and Matthew Modine.&quot; &quot;Time Out London&quot; commented that &quot;we get Geena Davis doing the all-action honours, and a hotchpotch script that seems to think pirate movies are so funny in themselves the need for more humour is superfluous. The plot&#x27;s well worn&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;It&#x27;s not possible to believe that Ms. Davis is the highly respected captain of a pirate ship, and it&#x27;s not even fun to try.&quot; Empire gave the film two stars out of five, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s mindless entertainment, but its critical and commercial failure doomed the pirate genre to a watery grave,&quot; while complimenting the locations and the set pieces: &quot;The film is at its best in the gorgeous locations and the huge (we&#x27;re talking Harlin - Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger - huge) set-pieces, concluding in a wild sea battle that is more John Woo on water&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a three-out-of-four-star rating, commenting: &quot;This is, in short, a satisfactory movie – but it doesn&#x27;t transcend its genre, and it&#x27;s not surprising or astonishing. I saw it because that was my job and, having seen it, I grant its skill, and award it three stars on that basis. But unless you&#x27;re really into pirate movies, it&#x27;s not a necessary film.&quot; Susan Wloszczyna from &quot;USA Today&quot; stated: &quot;If the sight of half-naked, tattooed sailors firing cannons at each other shivers your timbers, climb aboard. Even passable pirate movies don&#x27;t sail by every day,&quot; awarding the film 2.5 stars out of 4.

Harlin was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director for his work on the film, but &quot;lost&quot; to Paul Verhoeven for &quot;Showgirls&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In a radio interview in 2011, Renny Harlin discussed the film&#x27;s box office failure. He pointed out that Carolco Pictures was in ruin before shooting even began, but had to make the film since financing from foreign investors was already in place. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), the film&#x27;s distributor, was in the process of being sold and thus could not devote itself into financing a marketing campaign for the film. Carolco Pictures filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a month before &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;″s release.

In another interview, Matthew Modine said that other factors contributing to the production costs running out of control included Harlin&#x27;s cost-prohibitive habit of always having three cameras rolling at the same time; and Harlin and Davis spending large sums to have cases of V8 Vegetable Juice shipped out to the set in Malta for themselves. Towards the end of shooting, an entire room was found to be full of unopened juice and everyone present was obliged to drink it.

The failure of &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; is also credited with significantly reducing the bankability of pirate-themed films, which recovered only with the production of Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; in 2003.

Scott Mendelson of Forbes stated on the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary that the film, along with the similar box office disappointment of &quot;Aeon Flux&quot; nearly ten years later, contributed to the industry&#x27;s move away from producing films with female leads before and during the 21st century, under the assumption that mainstream audiences were not interested in such films.

==Video game==

A video game was published by Acclaim Entertainment and released for the major platforms of the time (such as the Super NES, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy) to tie in with the film. It loosely follows the events of the film.

<doc id="649122" wikidata="Q7591575" url="?curid=649122" title="St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque, Iowa)">
<text>St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral is a Catholic cathedral and a parish church in the Archdiocese of Dubuque located in Dubuque, Iowa. The parish is the oldest congregation of any Christian denomination in the state of Iowa. The cathedral church, rectory, former convent, and former parochial school building are contributing properties in the Cathedral Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
===Origins===
St. Raphael&#x27;s Parish traces its origin to July 1833 when the first group of settlers gathered for Mass in the home of Patrick Quigley. Father Charles Felix Van Quickenborne, a Belgian Jesuit, organized them into a parish. The parish did not have a regular church building yet, so the members met at various homes for mass. Father Quickenborne began planning for a church building, but left before the materials were assembled.
Father Charles Francis Fitzmaurice arrived in the area in 1834 and began working with the parish. He gathered materials and money to build the church, but he died during a cholera outbreak in the spring of 1835. He did not have a chance to begin work on the church building. For a time, the parishioners met in a log cabin that was set aside for worship.

The next pastor, Father Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP came to Dubuque later in 1835. He reorganized the parish and dedicated it to the Archangel Raphael. Under his guidance, a stone church building was constructed. Father Mazzuchelli personally drew the plans for this building, which served for the next 25 years. It was located just south of the current cathedral.

In 1837 Pope Gregory XVI created the Diocese of Dubuque. In 1839 Bishop Mathias Loras, the first Bishop of Dubuque, arrived after first going to France to recruit priests and raise funds to operate the new diocese. St. Raphael&#x27;s became the cathedral church for the diocese.


===Growth and expansion===
The next 20 years were a period of growth and expansion for the parish, and of the Church in general in Iowa. Bishop Loras encouraged both Irish and German immigrants to come to Iowa from the crowded conditions in the eastern United States. As a result, the parish began to grow in size.

By 1845 St. Raphael&#x27;s was usually quite crowded on Sundays. In 1849 there was a number of German families in the parish. Because of the crowded conditions, and because of the challenges of ministering to them, Bishop Loras granted permission for the Germans to form Holy Trinity parish in Dubuque. The parish eventually became known as St. Mary&#x27;s. In 1853 St. Patrick&#x27;s Church was built 12 blocks north to serve as a second parish for Irish families. Loras, however, made it a mission of St. Raphael&#x27;s so he would not lose the income he needed to build a new cathedral. This created problems between him and the local Irish community.

After St. Patrick&#x27;s was founded, Bishop Loras soon came to realize that the founding of those additional parishes would only be a temporary solution. He realized that St. Raphael&#x27;s parish needed a larger building.

===The present building===
The new cathedral was originally planned to be built on a &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Block&quot; on Main Street. As the city&#x27;s business district began to encroach on that location, Bishop Loras terminated the plan. In 1857, construction began on land just north of the old cathedral building. On July 5, 1857, a large crowd watched as the cornerstone was laid. The cathedral was based on Magdalen College in Oxford, England. The architect was John Mullany, a local architect who designed New Melleray Abbey, and St. Mary&#x27;s Church. He originally designed the cathedral in the Romanesque Revival style, however, the Panic of 1857 forced a change in plans and it was constructed in the Gothic Revival style instead. Despite his failing health, construction had advanced far enough that Bishop Loras was able to offer the first mass in the new cathedral on Christmas Day, 1857. He died two months later.

Construction on the cathedral, without its complete tower, was finished in 1861. The formal blessing and dedication were done by Bishop Clement Smyth, OCSO, on July 7 of that year. Father Mazzuchelli assisted with the dedication. St. Raphael&#x27;s is a brick structure built on a raised basement and a stone foundation. The lower part of its central tower is limestone. The three naves on the interior are divided by fourteen clustered wooden columns. The side elevations are seven bays in length. They are divided by buttresses and each has a lancet window in the center. Smaller windows are located over the side altars and there are three windows on either side of the chancel. Above the main entrance is a large lancet window. It was part of the original plan for the building. Even though the design of the cathedral was changed several times, the window was left as originally designed in each plan. The upper part of the window is visible from inside the church, while the lower part is hidden behind the organ.
The cathedral&#x27;s tower was finally finished in November 1876. The original plans called for a tall tower and spire, however after construction began to complete it, cracks started to form on the front wall. Instead of stone, the bell-chamber at the top of the tower is a wood structure that is encased in galvanized iron painted to resemble stone. Four tall pointed pinacles (no longer extant) were placed at the corners. New entrances were cut into the sides of the tower and the main facade of the church building was covered with Portland cement and made to look like stone.

Dubuque architect Fridolin Heer designed the chapel built in the back the cathedral in 1882. The new building obscured the three stained glass windows above the altar, so they were removed and placed above the altar of the new chapel. It served for nearly a century as the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, and its interior was briefly seen in the movie F.I.S.T. (1978). A number of other renovations were begun in 1886 according to the designs of Chicago architect J.J. Egan. They included new vaulting made of iron and lowering the column&#x27;s capitals down by . The interior was replastered, new Stations of the Cross were imported from Germany, a new gallery was installed in the rear of the church, and a large arch was cut into the tower to allow light from the lancet window to brighten what once was a dark nave. The frescos in the church were completed at this time by Luigi Gregori, artist in residence and professor at the University of Notre Dame who had previously worked at the Vatican, and his son Constantine. Bishop John Hennessy rededicated the cathedral on November 21, 1886. New stained glass windows, whose openings in the nave had been lowered , were imported from London and installed in 1889.

In 1902, a mortuary chapel was built in the lower level of the cathedral. Contained within this chapel are vaults buried underneath the floor in front of the altar. These vaults contain the bodies of former Bishops and Archbishops of Dubuque. Four of Dubuque&#x27;s Archbishops are buried elsewhere. Also buried in the chapel is Archbishop Raymond Ettledorf - a local priest who became Nuncio to New Zealand and parts of Africa. The altar and communion rail are made of Italian marble.

Two more renovations were done in the first part of the 20th century. The first was done in 1914, and the second in 1936. A new expanded main entrance was built in 1966. The addition contained new staircases that replaced the old outdoor stairs that originally led to the side entrances. Three new sets of doors were placed at street level. Also, an elevator was added to make the building more handicapped accessible. The chancel was also altered in the wake of liturgical reforms from the Second Vatican Council. Archbishop James Byrne celebrated the first Mass in English at St. Raphael&#x27;s.

===1986 renovations===

In 1986, the most extensive renovation in years was done to the church. At the time, it had been more than 50 years since the renovation. Also, the parish wanted to make some updates to the design which coincided with certain architectural and liturgical trends that were emerging in the Church at the time.

Work began in the late summer and fall of 1986. The Eucharistic Chapel was deconsecrated and remodeled into a gathering space for the parish and renamed the Cathedral Center. A new Eucharistic Chapel was created by placing a wooden screen between the original high altar, and the new &quot;ad populum&quot;-oriented altar. Portions of the original communion rail were used in construction. The original &quot;ad absidem&quot; altar was left intact because of its historical significance, and a new tabernacle was placed on the altar.

Because they were a fire hazard, the dividers between the pews were removed. The layers of varnish applied over the years to the woodwork were also removed, which was refinished to allow the light oak to show. The walls were painted a lighter color, and a new indirect lighting system was installed. A light green carpet was added and used throughout the building. Part of the Pietà altar was refurbished and installed in the sanctuary as the new main altar, replacing an early 1970s altar.

The sanctuary platform was extended so that more of the liturgical functions associated with the Mass took place closer to the congregation. The archbishop&#x27;s throne was replaced with a smaller, movable, less elaborate cathedra that allows him to directly face the congregation during Mass.

By November 1986 the renovations were complete. The remains of St. Cessianus were installed in the main altar during the first Mass held in the renovated Cathedral on November 23, 1986, celebrated by Archbishop Daniel Kucera, OSB. This is in reference to the tradition in the early years of the Church when Mass was often celebrated over the tombs of saints and martyrs. The bones of St. Cessianus, a second-century Roman martyr, constitute the Patronal Relic of the State of Iowa. Pope Gregory XVI presented them to Bishop Loras in 1838.

A pool was added to the baptismal font in 2005 for immersion baptism of older children and adults. It was completed in time for the Easter Vigil that year.

===Linked parishes===
St. Raphael and St. Patrick parishes were linked in 2010 by Archbishop Jerome Hanus, OSB. The two parishes share the same pastor and they work closely together on various programs.

==Pipe organ==

The cathedral&#x27;s pipe organ was originally built in 1890 by a builder now unknown, and was rebuilt by the Tellers-Kent Organ Company in 1937. It has 46 ranks, with three manuals. The organ is composed of a number of chambers in what was the choir loft, plus another chamber along the southern wall near the front of the church. There is also a set of chimes attached to the organ.

Like a number of other organs, the pipework is largely left out in the open rather than being contained with the case. The pipework was artistically arranged to make a stunning visual display.

The organ console is situated in the choir area on the main level near the front of the church. It can be moved for various functions, such as Mass and recitals. In 1991, the organ was refurbished after several years of fundraising. The organ is one of the larger ones in Dubuque, and is considered one of the finest in the city.

==Rectory, convent and school==

The cathedral shares its historic designation with the parish rectory and its former convent and school building. The rectory, which is adjacent to the cathedral on the north, was built around 1870. The three-story brick dwelling is considered the finest example of the Italianate style in the Cathedral District. The house features a low hipped roof, paired brackets on the eaves, simple window hoods, and an entrance canopy. The main entrance is flanked by side lights and it has a fan light above. The ironwork detailing and the doors were originally on the mansion of A.A. Cooper, which was named Greystone and was torn down in the late 1950s.

The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary arrived in Dubuque and started teaching in the parish school in 1843. The building that became their parish convent was built as a girls&#x27; school sometime in the 1880s. It is a three-story, brick, Second Empire style structure built on a limestone foundation. It features a mansard roof, eaves, a simple cornice and stone trim. The five-bay main facade has a small porch over the main entrance. The windows on the first two floors are flattened arch windows, and the third floor round arch windows are placed in dormers. The building was converted into living space for the sisters after a new school building was constructed in 1904. The building has subsequently been sold by the parish and converted into senior housing.

The former St. Raphael&#x27;s School building, which stands next to the cathedral on the south, was built in 1904 in the Neoclassical style. It replaced the boys&#x27; school and the girls&#x27; school buildings that were located in the rear of the cathedral property. The boys had been taught by a community of religious brothers. The boys&#x27; school building was located behind the girls&#x27; school and the cathedral itself and has subsequently been torn down. St. Raphael&#x27;s School closed in 1976 because of low enrollment. The building was sold by the parish in the mid-1980s.

<text>Sebastian Krüger (born 30 June 1963 in Hamelin, Germany) is a German artist.

After studying free painting with Prof. Dörfler at the Braunschweig University of Fine Arts he made a stunning reputation as the designer of a number of cover spreads for the press in Germany and abroad and as an illustrator and creative designer of various LP covers. He then stepped away from commercial work and became a painter. During the ‘90s he also collaborated with the italian political magazine L’Espresso. In recent years, his work has moved away from the &quot;star caricatures&quot; to New Pop Realism.

The artist lives and works near Hanover and in California. His primary medium is acrylic paint, and his paintings are hyper-realistic in detail, yet also extremely grotesque in their distortion. He is well known for his lifelike depictions of The Rolling Stones, in particular, Keith Richards.

<text>The spaces described in this article are pitch class spaces which model the relationships between pitch classes in some musical system. These models are often graphs, groups or lattices. Closely related to pitch class space is pitch space, which represents pitches rather than pitch classes, and chordal space, which models relationships between chords.

==Circular pitch class space==
The simplest pitch space model is the real line. In the MIDI Tuning Standard, for example, fundamental frequencies &quot;f&quot; are mapped to numbers &quot;p&quot; according to the equation

:formula_1

This creates a linear space in which octaves have size 12, semitones (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and A440 is assigned the number 69 (meaning middle C is assigned the number 60). To create circular pitch class space we identify or &quot;glue together&quot; pitches &quot;p&quot; and &quot;p&quot; + 12. The result is a continuous, circular pitch class space that mathematicians call Z/12Z.

== Circles of generators ==

Other models of pitch class space, such as the circle of fifths, attempt to describe the special relationship between pitch classes related by perfect fifth. In equal temperament, twelve successive fifths equate to seven octaves exactly, and hence in terms of pitch classes closes back to itself, forming a circle. We say that the pitch class of the fifth generates – or is a generator of – the space of twelve pitch classes.

By dividing the octave into n equal parts, and choosing an integer m&lt;n such that m and n are relatively prime – that is, have no common divisor – we obtain similar circles, which all have the structure of finite cyclic groups. By drawing a line between two pitch classes when they differ by a generator, we can depict the circle of generators as a cycle graph, in the shape of a regular polygon.

== Toroidal modulatory spaces ==

If we divide the octave into n parts, where n = rs is the product of two relatively prime integers r and s, we may represent every element of the tone space as the product of a certain number of &quot;r&quot; generators times a certain number of &quot;s&quot; generators; in other words, as the direct sum of two cyclic groups of orders r and s. We may now define a graph with n vertices on which the group acts, by adding an edge between two pitch classes whenever they differ by either an
&quot;r&quot; generator or an &quot;s&quot; generator (the so-called Cayley graph of formula_2 with generators &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;). The result is a graph of genus one, which is to say, a graph with a donut or torus shape. Such a graph is called a toroidal graph.

An example is equal temperament; twelve is the product of 3 and 4, and we may represent any pitch class as a combination of thirds of an octave, or major thirds, and fourths of an octave, or minor thirds, and then draw a toroidal graph by drawing an edge whenever two pitch classes differ by a major or minor third.

We may generalize immediately to any number of relatively prime factors, producing 
graphs can be drawn in a regular manner on an n-torus.

== Chains of generators ==

A linear temperament is a regular temperament of rank two generated by the octave and another interval, commonly called &quot;the&quot; generator. The most familiar example by far is meantone temperament, whose generator is a flattened, meantone fifth. The pitch classes of any linear temperament can be represented as lying along an infinite chain of generators; in meantone for instance this would be -F-C-G-D-A- 
etc. This defines a linear modulatory space.

== Cylindrical modulatory spaces ==

A temperament of rank two which is not linear has one generator which is a fraction of an octave, called the period. We may represent the modulatory space of such a temperament as n chains of generators in a circle, forming a cylinder. Here n is the number of periods in an octave.

For example, diaschismic temperament is the temperament which tempers out the diaschisma, or 2048/2025. It can be represented as two chains of slightly (3.25 to 3.55 cents) sharp fifths a half-octave apart, which can be depicted as two chains perpendicular to a circle and at opposite side of it. The cylindrical appearance of this sort of modulatory space becomes more apparent when the period is a smaller fraction of an octave; for example, ennealimmal temperament has a modulatory space consisting of nine chains of minor thirds in a circle (where the thirds may be only 0.02 to 0.03 cents sharp.)

== Five-limit modulatory space ==

Five limit just intonation has a modulatory space based on the fact that its pitch classes can be represented by 3a 5b, where a and b are integers. It is therefore a free abelian group with the two generators 3 and 5, and can be represented in terms of a square lattice with fifths along the horizontal axis, and major thirds along the vertical axis.

In many ways a more enlightening picture emerges if we represent it in terms of a hexagonal lattice instead; this is the Tonnetz of Hugo Riemann, discovered independently around the same time by Shohé Tanaka. The fifths are along the horizontal axis, and the major thirds point off to the right at an angle of sixty degrees. Another sixty degrees gives us the axis of major sixths, pointing off to the left. The non-unison elements of the 5-limit tonality diamond, 3/2, 5/4, 5/3, 4/3, 8/5, 6/5 are now arranged in a regular hexagon around 1. The triads are the equilateral triangles of this lattice, with the upwards-pointing triangles being major triads, and downward-pointing triangles being minor triads.

This picture of five-limit modulatory space is generally preferable since it treats the consonances in a uniform way, and does not suggest that, for instance, a major third is more of a consonance than a major sixth. When two lattice points are as close as possible, a unit distance apart, then and only then are they separated by a consonant interval. Hence the hexagonal lattice provides a superior picture of the structure of the five-limit modulatory space.

In more abstract mathematical terms, we can describe this lattice as the integer
pairs (a, b), where instead of the usual Euclidean distance we have a Euclidean distance defined in terms of the vector space norm
:formula_3

== Seven-limit modulatory space ==

In similar fashion, we can define a modulatory space for seven-limit just intonation, by representing 3a 5b 7c in terms of a corresponding cubic lattice. Once again, however, a more enlightening picture emerges if we represent it instead in terms of the three-dimensional analog of the hexagonal lattice, a lattice called A3, which is equivalent to the face centered cubic lattice, or D3. Abstractly, it can be defined as the integer triples (a, b, c), associated to 3a 5b 7c, where the distance measure is not the usual Euclidean distance but rather the Euclidean distance deriving from the vector space norm
:formula_4

In this picture, the twelve non-unison elements of the seven-limit tonality diamond are arranged around 1 in the shape of a cuboctahedron.

<doc id="649129" wikidata="Q2091538" url="?curid=649129" title="The Lady of Shalott">
<text>&quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; () is a lyrical ballad by the 19th-century English poet Alfred Tennyson and one of his best-known works. Inspired by the 13th-century Italian short prose text &quot;Donna di Scalotta&quot;, the poem tells the tragic story of Elaine of Astolat, a young noblewoman stranded in a tower up the river from Camelot. Tennyson wrote two versions of the poem, (in &quot;Poems&quot;, incorrectly dated 1833), of 20 stanzas, , of 19 stanzas (also in a book named &quot;Poems&quot;), and returned to the story in &quot;Lancelot and Elaine&quot;. The vivid medieval romanticism and enigmatic symbolism of &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; inspired many painters, especially the Pre-Raphaelites and their followers, as well as other authors and artists.

==Background==
Like Tennyson&#x27;s other early works, such as &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;, the poem recasts Arthurian subject matter loosely based on medieval sources. It is inspired by the legend of Elaine of Astolat, as recounted in a 13th-century Italian &quot;novellina&quot; titled &quot;La Damigella di Scalot&quot;, or &quot;Donna di Scalotta&quot; (No. LXXXII in the collection &quot;Il Novellino: Le ciento novelle antike&quot;); the earlier version is closer to the source material than the latter. Tennyson focused on the Lady&#x27;s &quot;isolation in the tower and her decision to participate in the living world, two subjects not even mentioned in &quot;Donna di Scalotta&quot;.&quot; Tennyson also wrote &quot;Lancelot and Elaine&quot;, a poem based on Thomas Malory&#x27;s version of the story from &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, which he included in his &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;.

==Story==
The first four stanzas of the 1842 second version of the poem describe a pastoral setting. The Lady of Shalott lives in an island castle in a river which flows to Camelot, but the local farmers know little about her.

Stanzas five to eight describe the lady&#x27;s life. She suffers from a mysterious curse and must continually weave images on her loom without ever looking directly out at the world. Instead, she looks into a mirror, which reflects the busy road and the people of Camelot who pass by her island.

The reflected images are described as &quot;shadows of the world&quot;, a metaphor that makes it clear they are a poor substitute for seeing directly (&quot;I am half-sick of shadows&quot;).

Stanzas nine to twelve describe &quot;bold Sir Lancelot&quot; as he rides by and is seen by the lady.

The remaining seven stanzas describe the effect on the lady of seeing Lancelot; she stops weaving and looks out of her window toward Camelot, bringing about the curse.

She leaves her tower, finds a boat upon which she writes her name, and floats down the river to Camelot. She dies before arriving at the palace. Among the knights and ladies who see her is Lancelot, who thinks she is lovely.

==Themes==
One of Tennyson&#x27;s biographers found the Arthurian material is &quot;introduced as a valid setting for the study of the artist and the dangers of personal isolation&quot;.

Feminist critics see the poem as concerned with issues of women&#x27;s sexuality and their place in the Victorian world, arguing that &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; centres on the temptation of sexuality and her innocence preserved by death. Christine Poulson discusses a feminist viewpoint and suggests &quot;the Lady of Shalott&#x27;s escape from her tower as an act of defiance, a symbol of female empowerment.&quot; Based on Poulson&#x27;s view, escaping from the tower allows the Lady of Shalott to emotionally break free and come to terms with female sexuality.

The depiction of death has also been interpreted as sleep. Poulson says that sleep has a connotation of physical abandonment and vulnerability, which can either suggest sexual fulfillment or be a metaphor for virginity. Fairy tales, such as &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; or &quot;Snow White&quot;, have traditionally depended upon this association. So, as related to the Lady of Shalott, Poulson says: &quot;for in death [she] has become a Sleeping Beauty who can never be wakened, symbols of perfect feminine passivity.&quot;

==Cultural influence==
===Art===
Tennyson&#x27;s early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (PRB). According to scholar Anne Zanzucchi, &quot;in a more general sense, it is fair to say that the Pre-Raphaelite fascination with Arthuriana is traceable to Tennyson&#x27;s work&quot;. In 1848, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt made a list of &quot;Immortals&quot;, artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including John Keats and Tennyson. &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; was particularly popular with the Brotherhood, which shared Tennyson&#x27;s interest in Arthuriana; several of the Brotherhood made paintings based on episodes from the poem. Two aspects, in particular, of &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; intrigued these artists: the idea of the lady trapped in her tower and the dying girl floating down the river towards Camelot.

In Edward Moxon&#x27;s 1857 edition of Tennyson&#x27;s works, illustrated by Hunt and Rossetti, Hunt depicted the moment when the Lady turns to see Lancelot. In the background of the illustration, Hunt juxtaposes the window facing Lancelot with a painting of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. According to Christine Poulson, the Crucifixion is the archetype of self-sacrifice and further emphasises the ideal that the Lady of Shalott fails to represent. Poulson also considers this representation of the subject in the context of changing women&#x27;s roles in the 1880s and 1890s, suggesting that it served as a warning of imminent death to women who stepped from their restricted roles and explored their desires. Rossetti depicted Lancelot&#x27;s contemplation of the Lady&#x27;s &quot;lovely face&quot;. Neither illustration pleased Tennyson, who took Hunt to task for depicting the Lady caught in the threads of her tapestry, something which is not described in the poem. Hunt explained that he wanted to sum up the whole poem in a single image, and that the entrapment by the threads suggested her &quot;weird fate&quot;. The scene fascinated Hunt, who returned to the composition at points throughout his life and finally painted a large scale version shortly before his death. He required assistants, as he was too frail to complete it himself. This deeply conceived evocation of the Lady, ensnared within the perfect rounds of her woven reality, is an apt illustration of the mythology of the weaving arts. This work is now in the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Connecticut.


John William Waterhouse painted three episodes from the poem. In 1888, he painted the Lady setting out for Camelot in her boat; this work is now in Tate Britain. In 1894, Waterhouse painted the Lady at the climactic moment when she turns to look at Lancelot in the window in &quot;The Lady of Shalott Looking at Lancelot&quot;; this work is now in Leeds Art Gallery. Poulson argues that Waterhouse&#x27;s impressionistic painting style in his 1894 rendering of &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; evokes a &quot;sense of vitality and urgency&quot;. In 1915, Waterhouse painted &quot;I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott&quot;, as she sits wistfully before her loom; this work is now in the Art Gallery of Ontario.

===Literature===
&quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; has been adapted in various ways in later works of literature. Agatha Christie used the line &quot;The mirror crack&#x27;d from side to side&quot; as the title of her 1962 novel in which the poem itself plays a large part in the plot. In Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1908), Anne Shirley reads various stanzas of the poem and acts out the Lady of Shalott&#x27;s tragic end as she floats down the river. Patricia A. McKillip used an adaptation of the poem as a primary theme of her novel &quot;The Tower at Stony Wood&quot; (2000). Lisa Ann Sandell&#x27;s novel &quot;Song of the Sparrow&quot; (2007) is a retelling of the story. Tennyson&#x27;s poem is also used for narration and as a narrative device in Kaori Yuki&#x27;s &quot;Camelot Garden&quot; (2008). In Jasper Fforde&#x27;s novel &quot;One of our Thursdays Is Missing&quot; (2011), the Lady of Shalott appears as a character, possessing a mirror that allows characters in the Book World to see into the real world (&quot;the Outland&quot;). In &quot;Half Sick of Shadows&quot; (2021) by Laura Sebastian, Elaine of Shalott is the main character and a close friend and advisor to King Arthur; the story primarily deals with the crowning of Arthur, but Elaine also has the ability to see future events through scrying at her loom. 

Quotes from the poem have been included in many novels, including Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1890), Eric Frank Russell&#x27;s &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1959), Muriel Spark&#x27;s &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1961), Connie Willis&#x27; &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; (1997), and Meg Cabot&#x27;s &quot;Avalon High&quot; (2005). In some novels, the poem is also referenced within the plot by characters, as in Nancy Mitford&#x27;s &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; (1949), Bel Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; (1965), David Benedictus&#x27;s &quot;Floating Down to Camelot&quot; (1985), Diana Wynne Jones&#x27; &quot;Hexwood&quot; (1993), Libba Bray&#x27;s &quot;A Great and Terrible Beauty&quot; (2003), and Jilly Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Wicked!&quot; (2006).

Its various lines have been turned into book titles by authors such as Jessica Anderson (&quot;Tirra Lirra by the River&quot;, 1978), Sharyn McCrumb (&quot;Sick of Shadows&quot;, 1984), Robin Klein (&quot;All in the Blue Unclouded Weather&quot;, 1991), and Alan Bradley (&quot;I Am Half-Sick of Shadows&quot;, 2011). It also inspired the title of Elizabeth Bishop&#x27;s poem &quot;The Gentleman of Shalott&quot; (1946).

===Music===
One of the first settings of the poem to music was by English composer Amy Horrocks who appeared at the 1898 Ballad Concert accompanying Ellen Bowick, for which Amy had composed a &quot;graceful and picturesque&quot; accompaniment of violin, cello and piano. Another early musical setting of the poem was probably a work for mezzo-soprano soloist, chorus and orchestra by the English composer Cyril Rootham, composed in 1909–1910. The only known performance of Rootham&#x27;s op 33 &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; was given in the School Hall at Eton College on 18 September 1999, with the Broadheath Singers and the Windsor Sinfonia conducted by Robert Tucker. In 1957–1958, Arthur Bliss (once a pupil of Cyril Rootham) composed a 40-minute ballet suite titled &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;.

Olivier Messiaen composed a piece for solo piano &quot;La dame de Shalott&quot; in 1917 based on Tennyson&#x27;s poem as his first composition; however, this piece is unpublished. It has been recorded at least twice. Maurice Jacobson composed a cantata setting the poem for tenor, choir and orchestra in 1942. In 1946, Phyllis Tate&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; was written for the 10th anniversary of the BBC Third Programme. Danish composer Bent Sørensen created a piece for viola solo, based on Waterhouse&#x27;s painting &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;.

Canadian singer Loreena McKennitt adapted the poem to music, and featured it on her 1991 album &quot;The Visit&quot;, though some poem lines were removed. Dutch gothic metal band Autumn referred to &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; in their songs &quot;Who Has Seen Her Wave Her Hand&quot;, &quot;Mirrors Magic Sights&quot;, &quot;When Lust Evokes the Curse&quot;, and &quot;Floating Towards Distress&quot; from their 2002 album &quot;When Lust Evokes the Curse&quot;, each song retelling parts of the story from the poem. The song titled &quot;Shalott&quot; on Emilie Autumn&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Opheliac&quot; tells the poem from her own perspective. The Band Perry&#x27;s country music video &quot;If I Die Young&quot; makes clear visual references to &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;: lead vocalist Kimberly Perry holds a book of poems by Tennyson as she lies in a boat, floating down a river like the Lady of Shalott (the boat in the Perry video is similar to some illustrations of the poem, such as the image by W. E. F. Britten).

The poem has been furthermore referred to or quoted in various ways in modern music. For instance, folk duo the Indigo Girls refer to the Lady of Shalott in &quot;Left Me a Fool&quot; from their 1987 album &quot;Strange Fire&quot; and Swedish pop band The Cardigans quotes it &quot;Give Me Your Eyes&quot;, a bonus track on &quot;Super Extra Gravity&quot;. British musician and singer Richard Thompson took the title for his 1994 album &quot;Mirror Blue&quot; from the poem.

===Television===
The poem forms the backbone of voice-over for the episode &quot;Tracie&#x27;s Story&quot; (2012) of &quot;Accused&quot;. In &quot;My Mother and Other Strangers&quot; (2016), Tennyson&#x27;s poem plays an important role.

The poem has been also often quoted in whole or in part within other television films and series. Examples of that include the &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; episode &quot;The Understudy&quot; (1975), &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1985), &quot;The Buccaneers&quot; episode &quot;Invasion&quot; (1995), the &quot;Endeavour&quot; episode &quot;Girl&quot; (2013), and the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; episode &quot;She Messy&quot; (2019), as well as the BBC film &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; (1983). The poem is also referenced in &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; season 4, episode 3, and in the movie &quot;Red Rooms&quot; (2023). Most recently in season 3, episode 4 of &quot;The Way Home&quot; (2025).

<text>The Barghawatas (also Barghwata or Berghouata) were a Berber tribal confederation on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, belonging to the Masmuda confederacy. After allying with the Sufri Kharijite rebellion in Morocco against the Umayyad Caliphate, they established an independent state (AD744-1058) in the area of Tamesna on the Atlantic coast between Safi and Salé under the leadership of Tarif al-Matghari.

==Etymology==
Some historians believe that the term &quot;Barghawata&quot; is a phonetic deformation of the term &quot;Barbati&quot;, a nickname which Tarif carried. It is thought that he was born in the area of Barbate, near Cádiz in Spain. However, Jérôme Carcopino and other historians think the name is much older and the tribe is the same as that which the Romans called &quot;Baquates&quot;, who up until the 7th century lived near Volubilis.

==History==

Few details are known about Barghawata. Most of the historical sources are largely posterior to their rule and often present a contradictory and confused historical context. However, one tradition appears more interesting. It comes from Córdoba in Spain and its author is the Large Prior of Barghawata and the Barghawata ambassador to Córdoba Abu Salih Zammur, around the middle of the 10th century. This tradition is regarded as most detailed concerning Barghwata. It was reported by Al Bakri, Ibn Hazm and Ibn Khaldun, although their interpretations comprise some divergent points of view.

The Barghawatas, along with the Ghomara and the Miknasa, launched the Berber Revolt of 739 or 740. They were fired up by Sufri Kharijite preachers, a Muslim sect that embraced a doctrine representing total egalitarianism in opposition to the aristocracy of the Quraysh which had grown more pronounced under the Umayyad Caliphate. The rebels elected Maysara al-Matghari to lead their revolt, and successfully seized control of nearly all of what is now Morocco, inspiring further rebellions in the Maghreb and al-Andalus. At the Battle of Bagdoura, the rebels annihilated a particularly strong army dispatched by the Umayyad caliph from Syria. But the rebels army itself was eventually defeated in the outskirts Kairouan, Ifriqiya in 741. In the aftermath, the rebel alliance dissolved. Even before this denouement, the Barghawatas, as founders of the revolt, had grown resentful of the attempt by later adherents, notably the Zenata chieftains, in alliance with the increasingly authoritarian Sufri commissars, to take control of the leadership of the rebellion. As their primary objective – the liberation of their people from Umayyad rule – had already been achieved, and there was little prospect of it ever being re-imposed, the Barghwata saw little point in continued military campaigns. In 742 or 743, the Barghwata removed themselves from the rebel alliance, and retreated to the Tamesna region, on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, where they founded their new independent state and abandoned their Sufri Kharijitism.

The Barghawatas ruled in the Tamesna region for more than three centuries (744–1058). Under the successors of Salih ibn Tarif, Ilyas ibn Salih (792-842); Yunus (842-888) and Abu Ghufail (888–913) the tribal kingdom was consolidated, and missions sent to neighbouring tribes. After initially good relations with the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba there was a break at the end of the 10th century. Two Umayyad incursions, as well as attacks by the Fatimids were fought off by the Barghawata. From the 11th century there was an intensive guerrilla war with the Banu Ifran. Even though the Barghawata were subsequently much weakened, they were still able to fend off Almoravid attacks—the spiritual leader of the Almoravids, Abdallah ibn Yasin, fell in battle against them on 7 July 1058. Only in 1149 were the Barghawata eliminated by the Almohads as a political and religious group.

==Religion==
It is possible that the Barghawata had a Judeo-Berber background, though accounts of entire Berber tribes practicing Judaism appear later and are unreliable.

After the conversion to Islam at the beginning of the 8th century and the Maysara uprising (739-742), the Barghawata Berbers formed their own state on the Atlantic coast between Safi and Salé.

The Barghawata kingdom practiced a distinctive form of Islam that blended elements from Sunni, Shi&#x27;a, and Kharijite traditions, combined with aspects of traditional Berber beliefs and customs. This syncretic religion included practices such as specific taboos, like abstaining from consuming eggs and chickens, and the belief in the baraka (blessing or spiritual power) of Ṣāliḥ ibn Ṭarīf and his family, whose saliva was regarded as sacred. 

== Tribes ==
The Barghawata confederacy was made of 29 tribes. 12 of these tribes adopted the Barghawata religion while 17 adhered to Islam.

*Tarif ibn Malik
*Ṣāliḥ ibn Tarīf (744-?), who declared himself prophet in 744 and went away at the age of 47, promising to return.

*Yunus ibn Ilyas (?842-888), who made Ṣāliḥ&#x27;s religion official and fought those who would not convert (killing 7770 people, according to Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s sources, some at a place called Tamlukeft). Curiously enough, he is also said to have performed the Hajj. He died in the 44th year of his reign.
*Abu-Ghufayl Muhammad (?888-917), who may also have been called a prophet (according to a poem Ibn-Khaldun cites) and who had 44 wives and more sons. He died in the 29th year of his reign.

<text>New York State Route 28 (NY 28) is a state highway extending for in the shape of a &quot;C&quot; between the Hudson Valley city of Kingston and southern Warren County in the U.S. state of New York. Along the way, it intersects several major routes, including Interstate 88 (I-88), U.S. Route 20 (US 20), and the New York State Thruway twice. The southern terminus of NY 28 is at NY 32 in Kingston and the northern terminus is at US 9 in Warrensburg. In Kingston, NY 28 is co-designated as Interstate 587 from its southern terminus at NY 32 to the roundabout linking it to the Thruway (I-87).

NY 28 was originally assigned in 1924, to an alignment extending from Colliersville in the south to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY 28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY 28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, Herkimer, and Oneida County, NY 28 has remained the same to this day.

==Route description==

===Ulster County===
NY 28&#x27;s southern terminus is with NY 32 (Albany Avenue) in the city of Kingston. The route heads north, then northwest on Colonel Chandler Drive, a four-lane freeway. The roadway is also designated and signed as I-587, which begins at NY 32 as well. Although Colonel Chandler Drive is built to Interstate Highway standards, it has no intermediary interchanges. After crossing over the Esopus Creek into Ulster, I-587 terminates at a roundabout that links I-587 and NY 28 to the New York State Thruway (I-87) at exit 19.

West of I-87, the route becomes a four-lane undivided road and crosses the Blue Line of Catskill Park and becomes the Onteora Trail. Not long afterward, the highway meets US 209 by way of a cloverleaf interchange. Past US 209, the highway becomes a four-lane divided highway and enters a rural area as it heads northwest into the center of the state park.

Near the eastern tip of the Ashokan Reservoir, in the town of Kingston, NY 28 intersects the eastern terminus of NY 28A. West of NY 28A, NY 28 continues towards the north and west along the northern edge of the reservoir. In West Hurley, the route intersects the southern terminus of NY 375. It proceeds along the reservoir to its western end in the town of Olive community of Boiceville, where NY 28A reconnects to the route. Here the mountains begin to loom over the road, with Mount Tremper dominating the view to the north as the route continues along Esopus Creek into the town of Shandaken after passing the southern terminus of NY 212 at Mount Pleasant. At Phoenicia, the largest settlement since Kingston, NY 214 reaches its southern terminus at the highway.

Past Phoenicia, the surrounding slopes become steeper as the road and creek curve around Panther Mountain, one of the Catskill High Peaks, to the south. At Allaben, the Shandaken Tunnel crosses under the road, bringing water from Schoharie Reservoir into the creek. The road and creek start bending to the south to the hamlet of Shandaken, where the town hall on the south side of the road is followed by the southern terminus of NY 42&#x27;s northern segment. As NY 28 continues trending southwest, the valley becomes less developed. Balsam Mountain, another High Peak, looms ahead.

The northern terminus of NY 42&#x27;s southern segment marks the small hamlet of Big Indian, after which Esopus Creek crosses for the last time, turning south to its source at Winnisook Lake. The road begins a sustained climb over the next two miles paralleling an Esopus tributary, Birch Creek, up to Pine Hill. At the road to Belleayre Ski Center, in Highmount, the last junction before it leaves the Catskill Park and enters Delaware County, it is for the first time signed as a north–south route.

===Delaware and Otsego counties===

Across the county line in Middletown, the highway shifts towards the west. NY 28 begins a concurrency with NY 30 in Margaretville, with the routes paralleling the East Branch of the Delaware River. After crossing the Delaware River, the route ends its concurrency with NY 30, and NY 28 continues northwest through Andes as Main Street and Delaware Avenue. In the village of Delhi, the highway becomes known as Andes Road and has a short concurrency with NY 10 in the village center. North of Delhi, it continues north towards the hamlet of Meredith, proceeding west past the hamlet. In Franklin, NY 28 makes a 90-degree turn to the north at the roundabout intersection with the eastern end of NY 357.

Once in Otsego County, it traverses an s-curve before veering to the east to follow the southern bank of the Susquehanna River through the town of Oneonta. The route initially connects to the city of Oneonta, which is located across the river from NY 28, via Main Street. Shortly afterward, NY 28 meets NY 23. The route turns north, overlapping NY 23 along the four-lane James F. Lettis Highway. The two routes cross the River and enter the Oneonta city limits before separating at I-88 exit 15. NY 23 continues north on the arterial, while NY 28 joins I-88 eastward out of the city.

Back in the town of Oneonta, the overlap between NY 28 and I-88 continues along the northern bank of the Susquehanna toward the hamlet of Emmons, where the expressway meets County Route 47 (CR 47) at exit 16. The overlap ends at exit 17 in Milford; however, NY 28 remains in close proximity to the Susquehanna River, which turns northward at the interchange. Roughly north of I-88, the highway passes over NY 7 with no access between the two. After another , the route meets D.K. Lifgren Drive (unsigned NY 992G), a connector providing access between Routes 7 and 28. North of Goodyear Lake, a body of water situated north of Lifgren Drive, the highway parallels the Susquehanna to the village of Milford, where it intersects the southern terminus of NY 166.

The highway continues northward along the banks of the Susquehanna to the village of Cooperstown, home to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Inside the village, the route is initially known as Chestnut Street. Two blocks from the business district of the village, it intersects NY 80, which occupies Chestnut Street north of this point. Both routes turn west, overlapping each other as the routes leave the village. The portion of the highway between the southern border of the village of Cooperstown and the northern intersection with Grove Street is maintained by the village, and is the only section of the route not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Routes 28 and 80 head towards the northwest, passing by the now-abandoned Cooperstown Airport. In Otsego, the NY 28/80 concurrency ends at the intersection of NY 205. NY 28 continues northward as it passes Canadarago Lake. In Richfield Springs, the highway has a concurrency with US 20 for . North of US 20, the highway exits Otsego County.

===Herkimer and Oneida counties===

In German Flatts, NY 28 becomes Columbia Street and intersects the western terminus of NY 168. In Mohawk, NY 28 intersects and has a brief overlap with NY 5S. After crossing the Mohawk River, NY 28 becomes Mohawk Street and meets I-90 (New York State Thruway) at exit 30. In the village of Herkimer, NY 28 has a concurrency with NY 5. North of NY 5, NY 28 begins to parallel the West Canada Creek. In Middleville, it intersects the western terminus of NY 29 and the northern terminus of NY 169. The highway executes a 90-degree turn at the three-route junction. NY 28 continues towards the north paralleling the West Canada Creek. In Poland, NY 28 begins a wrong-way concurrency with NY 8.

In Deerfield, Oneida County, NY 28 splits from NY 8. NY 28 crosses the West Canada Creek and leaves Oneida County for about , then re-crosses the creek and enters Oneida County again. In Trenton, NY 28 joins NY 12 northward toward Barneveld. In Barneveld, NY 12 and NY 28 intersect NY 365. NY 28 splits from NY 12 in Remsen and heads toward the northeast, passing through numerous lakes and reservoirs. In Forestport, it enters Adirondack Park as it parallels the Adirondack Mountains.

NY 28 briefly reenters Herkimer County, but does not have any major junctions. NY 28 passes the Fulton Chain Lakes, among several other large lakes, as it winds through the Adirondack Park.

===Hamilton and Warren counties===

The Fulton Chain Lakes which NY 28 has been following extend into Hamilton County. The highway soon reaches the settlement of Long Lake as it passes south of Raquette Lake. In the hamlet of Blue Mountain Lake, the route begins a wrong-way concurrency with NY 30; the concurrency ends in the hamlet of Indian Lake. East of NY 30, NY 28 begins to shift towards the south.

NY 28 enters Warren County paralleling the Hudson River. In North Creek, it intersects the eastern terminus of NY 28N. The highway continues towards the south opposite to its original course. In Wevertown, it intersects NY 8. It continues towards the southeast paralleling the Hudson River and in Warrensburg, NY 28 comes to an end at a &quot;Y&quot; intersection with US 9.

==History==

===Ulster and Delaware Turnpike===
In 1802, the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike was chartered by the New York State Legislature &quot;for improving and making a road from the west line of the Town of Salisbury in the State of Connecticut to the Susquehanna River at or near the Town of Jericho (now Bainbridge)&quot;. The portion of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike east of the Hudson River was also commonly known as the Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike or the Salisbury Turnpike. West of the river, the turnpike connected Kingston to modern-day Bainbridge. At that time it followed modern NY 28 west from Kingston up to the Delaware County hamlet of Andes. From Andes, the turnpike alignment left NY 28 to follow modern CR 2 to De Lancey, NY 10 to Walton, and NY 206 to the Village of Bainbridge. The turnpike crossed the river via the Kingston-Rhinecliff Ferry and used modern Rhinecliff Road and West Market Street to the village center of Rhinecliff, then roughly followed modern-day NY 308 to the hamlet of Eighmyville. It continued east from there using part of present-day CR 52 to eventually connect with and follow the route of current NY 199. The turnpike corporation operated through the late 19th century.

===Designation===
NY 28 was designated in 1924, by the New York State Department of Transportation from Colliersville (near Oneonta) north to Utica. At the time, NY 28 began at then-NY 9 in Colliersville and headed north on its current alignment to Cooperstown. NY 28 separated from its modern routing and continued to Springfield north of Cooperstown on what is now NY 80. Between Springfield and Richfield Springs, the highway utilized what is now US 20. At Richfield Springs, the highway turned north onto modern NY 167 and followed the current alignments of NY 167 and NY 168 to the village of Mohawk. Here, the highway turned westward, using a small portion of its current alignment and the present-day NY 5S corridor to connect to Utica by way of Ilion.

In 1924, what is now NY 28 was part of NY 19 from Kingston to Margaretville (where NY 19 turned north to follow modern NY 30 to Grand Gorge), NY 9 from Oneonta to Colliersville, NY 28 from Colliersville to Cooperstown, NY 2 from Trenton to Forestport, and NY 10 from North Creek to Wevertown. The remaining portions of modern NY 28 were unnumbered. By 1926, the portion of current NY 28 from Margaretville to Meredith was designated as part of NY 64. Past Meredith, NY 64 continued north to NY 23 on Palmerville Road, McDougal Road, Rathbun Road, and Prosser Hollow Road. Additionally, the segment of modern NY 28 from Middleville to Trenton was designated as part of NY 29. Between 1926 and 1930, what is now NY 28 between Blue Mountain Lake and North Creek became part of NY 10A, a highway extending from Long Lake to North Creek via Blue Mountain Lake.
In the 1930 renumbering, NY 28 was extended south from Colliersville to Kingston largely by way of its current alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. North of Cooperstown, the route was realigned to follow its modern routing between Cooperstown and Mohawk, then extended into the North Country through Wevertown to Warrensburg along its present alignment. Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The small portion of NY 10A that did not become part of NY 28 in the renumbering was incorporated into NY 10.

===Realignments===
In Oneida County, NY 28 originally broke from its modern alignment southeast of Barneveld to follow modern CR 56 into the village. At Mappa Avenue, then carrying NY 12, NY 28 turned north, overlapping NY 12 north along Mappa Avenue through the village. Outside of Barneveld, NY 12 and NY 28 were routed on Plank Road and what is now CR 82 before rejoining their modern alignment near the Remsen community of East Steuben. NY 28 was rerouted slightly to enter Barneveld via an extension of Trenton Falls Road and Mappa Avenue. Both NY 12 and NY 28 were realigned onto a new four-lane roadway from Barneveld to East Steuben in the 1950s.

Within Kingston, NY 28 initially began at the intersection of Broadway and East Chester Street, which was part of US 9W at the time. From there, NY 28 followed Broadway, Albany and Clinton avenues, North Front Street, and Washington Avenue through the city to Ulster, where it joined its modern routing at what is now the roundabout leading to New York State Thruway exit 19. When the initial plans for the Interstate Highway System were outlined by the Bureau of Public Roads in the 1955 &quot;Yellow Book&quot;, a highway was planned for the NY 28 corridor. This highway was included as part of the expansion to the system in 1957. Construction began on the roadway, which became Colonel Chandler Drive, in December 1958. It was designated as I-587 and became part of a rerouted NY 28 upon its completion in July 1960. NY 28 continued to extend eastward from Colonel Chandler Drive along Broadway to US 9W until its truncation to NY 32 in the early 1980s. Washington Avenue, bypassed by the new freeway, is now designated as NY 981K, an unsigned reference route in length, from Hurley Avenue to NY 28.

In the vicinity of Oneonta, NY 28 originally crossed the Susquehanna River by way of Main Street. The route followed Main Street through the city to Colliersville, where it turned north onto D.K. Lifgren Drive to rejoin its modern alignment. From downtown Oneonta to Colliersville, NY 28 overlapped NY 7. NY 28 was rerouted to follow its current alignment between Main Street south of Oneonta and D.K. Lifgren Drive near Colliersville in the early 1980s, following the completion of what is now NY 28 from I-88 exit 17 to D.K. Lifgren Drive. The portion of Main Street between NY 28 and NY 7 ( long) is now designated as NY 992D while D.K. Lifgren Drive ( in length) is now NY 992G.

In Herkimer, NY 28 originally continued on Mohawk Street past South Caroline Street. The route then turned north onto Prospect Street and continued across modern NY 5 to West German Street where it met NY 5. NY 28 then turned west and began to overlap NY 5. Two blocks later, NY 5 turned south onto North Washington Street, and NY 28 continued along German Street for before meeting its modern alignment. By 1978, a new alignment of NY 5 was built through Herkimer, and NY 28 had been placed on its modern alignment. Farther north at Kast Bridge, NY 28 crossed West Canada Creek via modern CR 7 (West End Road) then crossed the creek once again and met its modern alignment. Between 1967 and 1978, the creek was straightened and NY 28 was realigned along the west bank, which eliminated the two crossings.

===Memorial designation===

On June 14, 2004, Governor George E. Pataki announced that a portion of the highway in the Town of Hurley in Ulster County was to be designated as the &quot;New York State Troopers T. Michael Kelly and Kenneth A. Poorman Memorial Highway&quot;. During May 2000, troopers Kelly and Poorman were killed on this stretch of NY 28, when their police cruiser was struck by a tractor-trailer.

<doc id="649139" wikidata="Q109701697" url="?curid=649139" title="Prejudice (legal term)">
<text>Prejudice is a legal term with different meanings, which depend on whether it is used in criminal, civil, or common law. In legal context, &quot;prejudice&quot; differs from the more common use of the word and so the term has specific technical meanings.

Two of the most common applications of the word are as part of the terms &quot;with prejudice&quot; and &quot;without prejudice&quot;. In general, an action taken &quot;with prejudice&quot; is final. For example, &quot;dismissal with prejudice&quot; forbids a party to refile the case and might occur because the court finds the alleged facts can&#x27;t state a valid claim, or due of misconduct on the part of the party that filed the claim or criminal complaint, or as the result of an out-of-court agreement or settlement. Dismissal &quot;without prejudice&quot; (Latin: , ) allows the party the option to refile and is often a response to procedural or technical problems with the filing that the party may be able to correct by filing a new or amended filing.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word in its legal sense is , &#x27;a preceding judgement or decision&#x27;.

==With prejudice and without prejudice==
===Criminal law===
Depending on the country, a criminal proceeding which ends prematurely due to error, mistake, or misconduct may end as being dismissed with prejudice or without prejudice.

If the case ends without prejudice, the accused in the case (the defendant) may be retried. If the case ends with prejudice, the effect on the defendant (for the purpose of punishment) is the equivalent of a finding of not guilty, and they cannot be retried.

Some countries, however, allow the prosecution to appeal any acquittal.

====United States====
In the United States, if there is a mistrial, or the case is overturned on appeal, generally this is without prejudice and (in the case of a decision overturned on appeal) either all of the case is retried, or, if not all of the case is overturned, the parts that were overturned, such as a sentencing hearing, are retried. If the case is dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct, it will typically be dismissed with prejudice, which means that the defendant cannot be retried.

The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits that &quot;any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb&quot;. Outside of mistrial or appeal, the rule for whether or not a case is dismissed with or without prejudice thus depends on what condition the case is in and whether &quot;jeopardy&quot; has attached to the case. If jeopardy is attached to a case, a dismissal or a resolution is &quot;with prejudice&quot; and the case can never be litigated again. In the case of a trial by jury, jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled, and a dismissal (for prosecutorial misconduct or harmful error) at that point must be with prejudice. In the case of a bench trial (trial by the judge only), jeopardy attaches when the first witness in the case is sworn.

If a criminal case is brought to trial and the defendant is acquitted, jeopardy is attached to the case, and it can never be retried. If the defendant was convicted and his conviction is overturned, jeopardy is not attached because the defendant is considered to simply be in the same state they were before the case was tried.

If a person is brought to trial where they are charged with a particular crime and is convicted of a lesser offense, the conviction for a lesser offense is an acquittal of any higher-level offense (for example, a conviction for second-degree murder is an acquittal of first-degree murder). If the conviction is later overturned, the maximum the defendant can be retried for is the crime to which they were convicted; any higher charge is acquitted and thus is with prejudice.

===Civil law===
Within legal civil procedure, prejudice is a loss or injury, and refers specifically to a formal determination against a claimed legal right or cause of action. Thus, in a civil case, dismissal &quot;without prejudice&quot; is a dismissal that allows for re-filing of the case in the future. The present action is dismissed, but the possibility remains open that the plaintiff may file another suit on the same claim. The inverse phrase is dismissal &quot;with prejudice&quot;, in which the plaintiff is &quot;barred&quot; from filing another case on the same claim. Dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment and the case becomes &quot;res judicata&quot; on the claims that were or could have been brought in it; dismissal without prejudice is not.

===Common law===
In many common law jurisdictions, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore, the phrase has several usages.

====Dismissal====
A civil matter which is &quot;dismissed with prejudice&quot; is over forever, because the claim cannot be refiled. This is a final judgment, not subject to further action, other than appeal to a higher court. Absent a successful appeal, the plaintiff is prohibited from bringing any other lawsuit based on the claim.

If it is an involuntary dismissal, the judge has determined that the plaintiff has brought the case in bad faith, has failed to bring the case in a reasonable time, has failed to comply with court procedures, or on the merits after hearing the arguments in court. The dismissal itself may be appealed.

If it is a &quot;voluntary dismissal with prejudice&quot;, it is the result of an out-of-court agreement or settlement between parties that they agree is final.

If the case is dismissed &quot;without prejudice&quot;, the lawsuit can be filed again by the plaintiff. Typically, before a defendant has answered the suit or made a motion in the case, a plaintiff may file for &quot;dismissal without prejudice&quot; more easily and may do so for tactical reasons such as filing in a different jurisdiction.

====Settlement negotiations====
The term &quot;without prejudice&quot; is used in the course of negotiations to settle a lawsuit. It indicates that a particular conversation or letter cannot be tendered as evidence in court. It can be considered a form of privilege. This usage flows from the primary meaning: concessions and representations made for the purpose of settlement are simply being mooted for that purpose, and are not meant to actually concede those points in litigation.

Such correspondences must both be made in the course of negotiation, and represent a genuine attempt to settle a dispute between the parties. A prohibition exists on documents marked &quot;without prejudice&quot; being used as a façade to conceal facts or evidence from the court. As a result, documents marked &quot;without prejudice&quot; that do not actually contain any offer of settlement may be used as evidence, should the matter proceed to court. Courts may also decide to exclude from evidence communications not marked &quot;without prejudice&quot; that do contain offers of settlement.

The House of Lords&#x27; 2009 ruling in the case of &quot;Ofulue v Bossert&quot; UKHL 16 confirmed that the public policy intention behind the without prejudice rule, which serves to encourage the parties in dispute to speak freely in order to settle the issues between them, should enjoy &quot;wide protection&quot;, and therefore only in exceptional cases could statements issued &quot;without prejudice&quot; be used in evidence.

The term &quot;without prejudice save as to costs&quot; is a change to the above and refers to a communication that cannot be exhibited in court until the end of the trial, when the court awards legal costs to the successful party unless some other order is made because an offer was unreasonably rejected. This is also called the Calderbank formula, from &quot;Calderbank v Calderbank&quot; (2 All E.R. 333, 1976), and exists because English courts have held that &quot;without prejudice&quot; includes for the purposes of costs, as in Court of Appeal, in &quot;Walker v. Wilshire&quot; (23 QBD 335, 1889):

==Statutory provision==
UK freedom of information law renders certain information exempt from disclosure obligations where its publication &quot;would, or would be likely to&quot;, prejudice any of the interests protected by statutory provision. Freedom of information jurisprudence on the test for &quot;prejudice&quot; was developed in the tribunal case of &quot;Hogan v Oxford City Council&quot; (2005), which ruled that the applicable interests to be protected need to be identified, along with the nature of the prejudice being contemplated, and the likelihood of the prejudice occurring. The term &quot;likely&quot; indicates &quot;a high degree of probability&quot;: it does not need to reach a level of &quot;more probable than not&quot;, but in some circumstances that level may be reached. Ultimately the word &quot;likely&quot; has &quot;neither a single nor even a meaning&quot;.

==Prejudicial actions==

An action (such as an error made by the court) is prejudicial if it substantially affects a litigant&#x27;s legal rights. Thus, a harmless error would not be prejudicial, while plain error is sometimes defined as a highly prejudicial error. An error that is determined not to have been prejudicial will typically not be considered a reversible error.

A court may sometimes explicitly reassure a litigant that an action will not prejudice them. For example, if a defendant left an important document at home that was needed for the court hearing, the court may assure them that continuing the proceedings to a future date will not prejudice them in any way—that is, that it will not affect the court&#x27;s judgment in a way that disfavors them. Or a court may assure a litigant that agreeing to a temporary arrangement, e.g. concerning custody of an asset whose ownership is disputed, will not prejudice their rights with regard to the eventual judgment of the court in the case. In other words, the litigant will not be waiving any rights other than those they&#x27;re specifically agreeing to temporarily waive.

In English criminal law, from the moment a suspect is charged until judgment is given, it is not permitted to report on matters that may be given in evidence – or that might otherwise influence the jury – before this evidence is presented. Unless the court directs otherwise, media may report the evidence given in court but may not speculate on its significance. These restrictions are normally removed after judgment is given, unless to do so might prejudice another prosecution in progress.

<text>The Petticoat affair (also known as the Eaton affair) was a political scandal involving members of President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Cabinet and their wives, from 1829 to 1831. Led by Floride Calhoun, wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun, these women, dubbed the &quot;Petticoats&quot;, socially ostracized Secretary of War John Eaton and his wife, Peggy Eaton, over disapproval of the circumstances surrounding the Eatons&#x27; marriage and what they deemed her failure to meet the &quot;moral standards of a &quot;Cabinet Wife&quot;&quot;.

The Petticoat affair rattled the entire Jackson administration and eventually led to the resignations of Vice President Calhoun (the first such departure in U.S. history) and all but one Cabinet member. The ordeal facilitated Martin Van Buren&#x27;s rise to the presidency and was in part responsible for reducing Calhoun&#x27;s stature from that of a nationwide political figure with presidential aspirations into a major sectional leader of the Southern United States.

==Background==
Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Eaton was the eldest daughter of William O&#x27;Neill, owner of the Franklin House, a boarding house and tavern located in Washington, D.C., a short distance from the White House, that was a well-known social hub popular with politicians and military officials. Peggy was well-educated for a woman of that era – she studied French and was known for her ability to play the piano. William T. Barry, who later served as Postmaster General, wrote &quot;of a charming little girl ... who very frequently plays the piano, and entertains us with agreeable songs&quot;.

As a young girl, her reputation had already begun to come under scrutiny because of her employment in a bar frequented by men, as well as her casual bantering with the boarding house&#x27;s clientele. In her later years, Peggy reminisced, &quot;While I was still in pantalettes and rolling hoops with other girls, I had the attention of men, young and old; enough to turn a girl&#x27;s head.&quot;

When Peggy was 15 years old, her father intervened to prevent her attempt to elope with an Army officer. In 1816, the 17-year-old Peggy married John B. Timberlake, a purser in the United States Navy. Timberlake, aged 39, had a reputation as a drunkard and was heavily in debt. The Timberlakes became acquainted with John Eaton in 1818. At the time, Eaton was a wealthy 28-year-old widower and newly elected U.S. Senator from Tennessee, despite not yet having reached the constitutionally-mandated minimum age of 30. He was also a long-time friend of Andrew Jackson.

Once Timberlake told Eaton of his financial troubles, Eaton unsuccessfully attempted to have the Senate pass legislation that would authorize payment of the debts Timberlake had accrued during his Naval service. Eventually, Eaton paid Timberlake&#x27;s debts and procured him a lucrative posting to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Mediterranean Squadron; many rumormongers asserted that Eaton aided Timberlake as a means to remove him from Washington, in order for Eaton to socialize with Peggy. 

While with the Mediterranean Squadron, Timberlake died on April 2, 1828. This served to fuel new rumors throughout Washington, suggesting he had taken his own life as the result of Eaton&#x27;s supposed affair with Peggy. Medical examiners concluded Timberlake had died of pneumonia, brought on by pulmonary disease.

==Controversy==
Jackson was elected president in 1828, with his term set to begin on March 4, 1829. He was reportedly fond of Peggy Timberlake and encouraged Eaton to marry her. They were wed on January 1, 1829, only nine months after her husband&#x27;s death. Customarily, it would have been considered proper for their marriage to have followed a longer mourning period.

Historian John F. Marszalek explains his opinion on the &quot;real reasons Washington society found Peggy unacceptable&quot;: 
She did not know her place; she forthrightly spoke up about anything that came to her mind, even topics of which women were supposed to be ignorant. She thrust herself into the world in a manner inappropriate for a woman. ... Accept her, and society was in danger of disruption. Accept this uncouth, impure, forward, worldly woman, and the wall of virtue and morality would be breached and society would have no further defenses against the forces of frightening change. Margaret Eaton was not that important in herself; it was what she represented that constituted the threat. Proper women had no choice; they had to prevent her acceptance into society as part of their defense of that society&#x27;s morality.

When Jackson assumed the presidency, he appointed Eaton as Secretary of War. Floride Calhoun, Second Lady of the United States, led the wives of other Washington political figures, mostly those of Jackson&#x27;s cabinet members, in an &quot;anti-Peggy&quot; coalition, which served to shun the Eatons socially and publicly. The women refused to pay courtesy calls to the Eatons at their home and to receive them as visitors, and denied them invitations to parties and other social events.

Emily Donelson, niece of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s late wife Rachel Donelson Robards and the wife of Jackson&#x27;s adopted son and confidant Andrew Jackson Donelson, served as Jackson&#x27;s &quot;surrogate First Lady&quot;. Emily Donelson chose to side with the Calhoun faction, which led Jackson to replace her with his daughter-in-law Sarah Yorke Jackson as his official hostess. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren was a widower and the only unmarried member of the Cabinet; he raised himself in Jackson&#x27;s esteem by aligning himself with the Eatons.

Jackson&#x27;s sympathy for the Eatons stemmed in part from his late wife Rachel being the subject of innuendo during the presidential campaign, when questions arose as to whether her first marriage had been legally ended before she married Jackson. Jackson believed these attacks were the cause of Rachel&#x27;s death on December 22, 1828, several weeks after his election to the presidency.

Eaton&#x27;s entry into a high-profile Cabinet post helped intensify the opposition of Mrs. Calhoun&#x27;s group. In addition, Calhoun was becoming the focal point of opposition to Jackson; Calhoun&#x27;s supporters opposed a second term for Jackson because they wanted Calhoun elected president. In addition, Jackson favored and Calhoun opposed the protective tariff that came to be known as the Tariff of Abominations. U.S. tariffs on imported goods generally favored Northern industries by limiting competition, but Southerners opposed them because the tariffs raised the price of finished goods but not the raw materials produced in the South. 

The dispute over the tariff led to the nullification crisis of 1832, with Southernersincluding Calhounarguing that states could refuse to obey federal laws to which they objected, even to the point of secession from the Union, while Jackson vowed to prevent secession and preserve the Union at any cost. Because Calhoun was the most visible opponent of the Jackson administration, Jackson felt that Calhoun and other anti-Jackson officials were fanning the flames of the Peggy Eaton controversy in an attempt to gain political leverage. Duff Green, a Calhoun protégé and editor of the &quot;United States Telegraph,&quot; accused Eaton of secretly working to have pro-Calhoun Cabinet members Samuel D. Ingham and John Branch removed from their positions.

Eaton took his revenge on Calhoun. In 1830, reports had emerged which accurately stated that while Calhoun was Secretary of War and Jackson was a major general in the U.S. Army, Calhoun had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These reports infuriated Jackson. Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson about the possibility of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson at the time of the Seminole War. Eaton did nothing. This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the &quot;Telegraph.&quot; Their publication gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy, which further enraged the president.

==Resolution==
The dispute was finally resolved when Van Buren offered to resign, giving Jackson the opportunity to reorganize his Cabinet by asking for the resignations of the anti-Eaton Cabinet members. Postmaster General William T. Barry was the lone Cabinet member to stay, and Eaton eventually received appointments that took him away from Washington, first as governor of Florida Territory, and then as minister to Spain.

On June 17, the day before Eaton formally resigned, a story appeared in the &quot;Telegraph&quot; stating that it had been &quot;proved&quot; that the families of Ingham, Branch, and Attorney General John M. Berrien had refused to associate with Mr. Eaton. Eaton wrote to all three men demanding that they answer for the article. Ingham sent back a contemptuous letter stating that, while he was not the source for the article, the information was still true. On June 18, Eaton challenged Ingham to a duel through Eaton&#x27;s brother in law, Dr. Philip G. Randolph, who visited Ingham twice and the second time threatened him with personal harm if he did not comply with Eaton&#x27;s demands. Randolph was dismissed, and the next morning Ingham sent a note to Eaton discourteously declining the invitation and describing his situation as one of &quot;pity and contempt&quot;. Eaton wrote a letter back to Ingham accusing him of cowardice. Ingham was then informed that Eaton, Randolph, and others were looking to assault him. He gathered together his own bodyguard and was not immediately molested. However, he reported that for the next two nights Eaton and his men continued to lurk about his dwelling and threaten him. He then left the city and returned safely to his home. Ingham communicated to Jackson his version of what took place, and Jackson asked Eaton to explain himself. Eaton admitted that he &quot;passed by&quot; the place where Ingham had been staying, &quot;but at no point attempted to enter ... or besiege it&quot;.

==Aftermath==

In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren as minister to Great Britain. Calhoun killed the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming his act would &quot;...kill him, sir, kill him dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick.&quot; However, Calhoun only made Van Buren seem the victim of petty politics, which were rooted largely in the Eaton controversy. This raised Van Buren even further in Jackson&#x27;s esteem. Van Buren succeeded Calhoun as vice president when Jackson won a second term in 1832. Van Buren thus became the &quot;de facto&quot; heir to the presidency and succeeded Jackson in 1837.

Although Emily Donelson had supported Floride Calhoun, after the controversy ended Jackson asked her to return as his official hostess; she resumed these duties in conjunction with Sarah Yorke Jackson until returning to Tennessee after contracting tuberculosis, leaving Sarah Yorke Jackson to serve alone as Jackson&#x27;s hostess.

John Calhoun resigned as vice president shortly before the end of his term and returned with his wife to South Carolina. Quickly elected to the U.S. Senate, he returned to Washington not as a national leader with presidential prospects but as a regional leader who argued in favor of states&#x27; rights and the expansion of slavery.

In regard to the Petticoat affair, Jackson later remarked, &quot;I [would] rather have live vermin on my back than the tongue of one of these Washington women on my reputation.&quot; To Jackson, Peggy Eaton was just another of many wronged women whom over his lifetime he had known and defended. He believed that every woman he had defended in his life, including her, had been the victim of ulterior motives, so that political enemies could bring him down.

==Legacy==
Historian Robert V. Remini said that &quot;the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And it was all so needless.&quot; Historian Kirsten E. Wood argues that it &quot;was a national political issue, raising questions of manhood, womanhood, presidential power, politics, and morality.&quot;

The 1936 film &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; is a fictionalized account of the Petticoat affair. It features Joan Crawford as Peggy O&#x27;Neill, Robert Taylor as John Timberlake, Lionel Barrymore as Andrew Jackson, and Franchot Tone as John Eaton.

<text>Gna! was a centralized location where software developers could develop, distribute and maintain free software. The service was shut down in 2017 after 13 years in service for dozens of software projects and millions of downloads served.

In August 2022, Gna! was relaunched by Loïc Dachary as a paid service for hosting Forgejo instances.

== History ==
In the beginning, GNA (recursively acronymed &quot;Gna&#x27;s Not Axis&quot;), was an association formed by Loïc Dachary for the distribution of free software.

On the 12 April 2001, GNA turned into the French chapter of Free Software Foundation (FSF).

At the end of 2003, the GNU Savannah server was replaced by FSF after a security compromise. A dispute broke out between FSF, who owned Savannah, and Savannah&#x27;s maintainers, including developers of the Savannah software over the levels of administration the FSF should be given. FSF announced that it was going to switch to GForge, leaving frayed tempers among the developers, as result of a conflict about Savannah maintainers&#x27; role.

In January 2004, Loïc Dachary (who also started GNU Savannah) and several former GNU Savannah maintainers set up &quot;Gna!&quot; as a continuation of the Savannah project, but hosted on servers owned by the Free Software Foundation France. &quot;Gna!&quot; is paradoxically recursively acronymed &quot;Gna&#x27;s Not an Acronym!&quot;. It is managed by a self-organized team, supported by Free Software Foundation France.

For the hosted projects, Gna! provides source code version control (CVS, and SVN), a download space, project monitoring facilities, etc.

A notable exception to other free software community portals is Gna&#x27;s strict licensing restrictions: only GNU General Public License compatible projects may be developed on the server. This is one of the reasons why it is significantly smaller than other portals. Its small userbase is advertised as a positive because it generally aids in the quick resolution of problems; a process which can take weeks on the larger sites.

In November 2016, the Gna! project announced it would soon be closing down, and explained &quot;soon&quot; to mean &quot;within 3 months [of February 2017], or when the hardware dies.&quot;

On 24 May 2017, Gna! servers were shut down.

In April 2022, Loïc Dachary and Aravinth Manivannan launched a paid service for hosting Gitea (later Forgejo) instances, called Hostea. In August 2022 Hostea was renamed to Gna!.

<doc id="649168" wikidata="Q460978" url="?curid=649168" title="List of presidents of the Royal Society">
<text>The president of the Royal Society (PRS), also known as the Royal Society of London, is the elected Head of the Royal Society of London who presides over meetings of the society&#x27;s council.

After an informal meeting (a lecture) by Christopher Wren at Gresham College, the Royal Society was officially founded on 28 November 1660 when a group of academics decided to found &quot;a College for the Promoting of Mathematical Experimental Learning&quot;, acquiring a Royal Charter on 15 July 1662. King Charles II granted the society a royal charter in 1662, formally establishing it as the &quot;Royal Society of London.&quot; The Royal Charter nominated William Brouncker as president and stipulated that future presidents should be elected by the Council and Fellows of the Society at anniversary meetings each year on St. Andrew&#x27;s Day (30 November).

The details of the presidency were described by the second Royal Charter, which did not set any limit on how long a president could serve. There were considerable fluctuations in the president&#x27;s term of office until well into the 19th century. By then, sentiment had turned against electing wealthy amateurs solely because they might become patrons of the society, and in 1847 the society decided that Fellows would be elected solely on scientific merit. Since the 1870s, it has been usual (with a few exceptions) for each President to serve for exactly five years. Under the current statutes, a president cannot serve for more than five years. The current President is Sir Adrian Smith who began his 5-year tenure on 30 November 2020.

Historically, the duties of the president have been both formal and social. Under the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, the President was one of only a few people authorized to certify that a particular experiment on an animal was justified, and in addition he acted as the government&#x27;s chief (albeit informal) advisor for scientific matters. At the same time, the President was tasked with entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.

The changeover of presidents occurs on the Royal Society Anniversary Day, the weekday on or nearest to 30 November, after the departing President&#x27;s Anniversary Address. Of the 26 presidents since 1901, 18 have been Nobel laureates (seven in Physiology or Medicine, four in Physics and seven in Chemistry). Many past presidents, including all those in the 20th century, have been appointed to the Order of Merit.

Sir Joseph Banks was the longest serving president of Royal Society.

<doc id="649170" wikidata="Q2905235" url="?curid=649170" title="Starsailor (album)">
<text>Starsailor is the sixth studio album by Tim Buckley, released on Herb Cohen&#x27;s Straight Records label in November 1970. &quot;Starsailor&quot; marks Buckley&#x27;s full embrace of avant-garde and jazz-rock styles into his music. Although it alienated elements of his fanbase upon release, it also contains his best known song, &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, which was written much earlier than the rest of the material. Bunk Gardner, a former member of the Mothers of Invention, joined Buckley&#x27;s backing band to record the album. Also, Buckley began working again with lyricist Larry Beckett, after a three-album hiatus.

Leontyne Price attended a concert in New York City during the supporting tour and told Buckley, &quot;Boy, I wish they were writing things like that for us opera singers,&quot; to which Buckley responded, &quot;Well, do what I did; get your own band.&quot;

==Renewed interest==
&quot;Song to the Siren&quot; has been covered by a variety of artists, most notably by This Mortal Coil, which featured on their 1984 album &quot;It&#x27;ll End in Tears&quot;. John Frusciante, in 2009, covered this song on his album &quot;The Empyrean&quot;. Amen Dunes covered the song on their 2015 EP release &quot;Cowboy Worship&quot;. The British trance act Lost Witness also released a remix single, entitled &quot;Did I Dream (Song to the Siren)&quot;.

While the revival of &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; renewed interest in Buckley amongst independent artists in the 1980s, the success of his estranged son, Jeff Buckley, in the 1990s, inspired indie rock artists to look at the career of his father. The British band Starsailor took their name from this album.

The album had a brief reissue on CD by the Enigma Retro label, but like the other Tim Buckley release on the Straight Records label (1969&#x27;s &quot;Blue Afternoon&quot;), it drifted out of print due to legal battles over who owned the rights to the music. This stems back to a 1976 separation and lawsuit between Herb Cohen and Frank Zappa, the co-owners of Straight Records. As a result, many of the albums released on Straight (including Captain Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot;) are very difficult to find on CD. In 2006, the album was released on the iTunes Music Store, making it available to the general public once more. In 2007, 4 Men With Beards reissued the album on vinyl, as well as the rest of Tim Buckley&#x27;s nine-album catalogue. However, CD copies of this and &quot;Blue Afternoon&quot; remained out of print and difficult to find on the market until the release in 2017 of &quot;The Complete Album Collection&quot; box set.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Starsailor&quot; was featured at #50 in Pitchfork&#x27;s 2004 list of &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the 1970s&quot;. Reviewer Dominique Leone said of the album, &quot;&quot;Starsailor&quot; is a masterpiece in every sense. It captured its maker at his freest and most willing to throw caution and sales to the wind, while simultaneously at his most creative and most capable of pulling off songs and moods that, from practically anyone else, would sound cartoonish, clumsy and confused.&quot;

In addition, &quot;Starsailor&quot; was selected as the 47th best rock record of all time in the 1987 book &quot;The Top 100 Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Albums of All Time&quot;.

In 2000 it was voted number 507 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<doc id="649171" wikidata="Q954599" url="?curid=649171" title="Kadesh (biblical)">
<text>Kadesh or Qadesh or Cades (, from the root &quot;holy&quot;) is a place-name that occurs several times in the Hebrew Bible, describing a site or sites located south of, or at the southern border of, Canaan and the Kingdom of Judah in the kingdom of Israel. Many modern academics hold that it was a single site, located at the modern Tel el-Qudeirat, while some academics and rabbinical authorities hold that there were two locations named Kadesh. A related term, either synonymous with Kadesh or referring to one of the two sites, is Kadesh (or Qadesh) Barnea. Various etymologies for &quot;Barnea&quot; have been proposed, including &#x27;desert of wanderings,&#x27; but none have produced widespread agreement.

The Bible mentions Kadesh and/or Kadesh Barnea in a number of episodes, making it an important site (or sites) in narratives concerning Israelite origins. Kadesh was the chief site of encampment for the Israelites during their wandering in the Zin Desert (Deuteronomy 1:46), as well as the place from which the Israelite spies were sent to Canaan (Numbers 13:1–26). The first failed attempt to capture Canaan was made from Kadesh (). Moses struck a rock (rather than speaking to it as the Lord commanded) that brought forth water at Kadesh (). Miriam () and Aaron () both died and were buried near a place named Kadesh. Moses sent envoys to the King of Edom from Kadesh (), asking for permission to let the Israelites use the King&#x27;s Highway passing through his territory, which the Edomite king denied.

Kadesh Barnea is a key feature in the common biblical formula delineating the southern border of the Land of Israel (cf. , , etc.) and thus its identification is key to understanding both the ideal and geopolitically realised borders of ancient Israel.
==Biblical references==
* &quot;And they turned back, and came to En-mishpat--the same is Kadesh--and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.&quot;
* &quot;Wherefore the well was called &#x27;Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.&quot;
* &quot;And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.&quot;
* &quot;And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.&quot;
* &quot;And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.&quot;
* &quot;And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom: &#x27;Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us; how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers; and when we cried unto the LORD, He heard our voice, and sent a messenger, and brought us forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.&quot;
* &quot;And they journeyed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.&quot;
* &quot;And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered; because ye rebelled against My commandment in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes.&#x27;--These are the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.&quot;
* &quot;And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin--the same is Kadesh. And they journeyed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.&quot;
* &quot;So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.&quot;
* &quot;Because ye trespassed against Me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel.&quot;
* &quot;But when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh; then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying: Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh.&quot;
* &quot;The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.&quot;
* &quot;And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the Brook, unto the Great Sea. This is the south side southward.&quot;
* &quot;And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook, unto the Great Sea.&quot;

==Location==
The most common identification of Kadesh or Kadesh Barnea in modern scholarship is with the present-day Tell el-Qudeirat, with most contemporary scholars seeing the biblical references to Kadesh as referring to a single site.

The Bible locates Kadesh, or Kadesh Barnea, as an oasis south of Canaan, west of the Aravah and east of the Brook of Egypt. It is 11 days&#x27; march by way of Mount Seir from Horeb (Deuteronomy 1:2).

By the late nineteenth century, as many as eighteen sites had been proposed for biblical Kadesh. One source of confusion has been the fact that Kadesh is sometimes mentioned in connection with the Desert of Paran () and at other times with the Zin Desert (). This discrepancy has been noted by commentators as early as the Middle Ages. Some (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Hezekiah ben Manoah) sought a reconciliatory model, while others (Abraham ibn Ezra and Nahmanides) proposed two separate sites named Kadesh.

A minority of recent scholars have maintained a two-site theory, with a western Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin and an eastern one in the wilderness of Paran, the latter often associated with Petra in Jordan. The two-site theory also appears to have been held by Josephus and Eusebius of Caesarea. Josephus identifies Miriam&#x27;s burial site (which the Bible identifies as Kadesh) with Petra, which he called &quot;Rekem&quot; (Nabataean Aramaic , *&quot;Raqēmō&quot;).

After a period in which researchers identified Kadesh with the similarly named Ein Qedeis, since 1905, Ain el-Qudeirat in the North Sinai Governorate of Egypt has been widely accepted as the location of Kadesh Barnea. Several Iron Age fortresses have been excavated there. The oldest, a small elliptical structure, dates to the 10th century BCE, and was abandoned for some time after its first destruction. A second fort, constructed during the eighth century BCE (probably during the reign of Uzziah) was destroyed during the seventh century BCE, most likely during Manasseh of Judah&#x27;s reign. Two ostraca engraved in Hebrew, dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, have been recovered there, suggesting Israelite occupation.

==Archaeological exploration==
The Ain el-Qudeirat oasis in Wadi el-Ain of northern Sinai was first archaeologically investigated in 1914, by two British researchers, Leonard Woolley and T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) as part of their regional survey on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund. At the top of the Ain el-Qudeirat site they identified a fortress—built in the last decades of the 8th century BCE and destroyed around 600 BCE—and they cut a sounding into one of its rooms. During Israel&#x27;s short occupation of the Sinai in 1956, Moshe Dothan of the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (IDAM), dug additional soundings in the fortress.

During the Israeli occupation of the Sinai following the 1967 Six-Day War, Rudolph Cohen of the IDAM directed the first large-scale excavations, which took place in 1976–1982 and were fully published after Cohen&#x27;s death. Among the earliest finds were local pottery sherds dated, as of 2015, to the end of the Late Bronze Age (early 12th century BCE) and the Early Iron I period (end of the 12th and the 11th century BCE), as well as four Egyptian-style items—two seals and two seal impressions—from later strata, probably also older than the 10th-century BCE fortress.

According to a 2010 article, the excavations uncovered copious remains of the Middle Bronze Age I period (MBA I or MBI, sometimes known as the Intermediate Bronze Age, IBA), which were also found at numerous other sites in the Negev. On the other hand, Late Bronze Age, the conventional time of the Exodus, was unattested in the Negev and at the Ain el-Qudeirat site, although more recent reevaluations of Cohen&#x27;s findings at Ain el-Qudeirat indicate that the site was probably occupied from at least the 12th century BCE.

In 1983, Cohen suggested that the MBI people should be identified as &quot;proto-Israelites&quot; based on migratory patterns and cultural discontinuity although there is evidence that they retained the earlier cultural customs of the southern Levant. Others archaeologists suggest they were Amorites and Kurgans, who arrived from the north and east.

Cohen wrapped up his excavation campaign in 1982, soon before Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from the Sinai as part of the peace agreement with Egypt. All field research at the ancient tell (mound) ceased at that point and as of 2015, it hasn&#x27;t been renewed since.

<doc id="649174" wikidata="Q2420224" url="?curid=649174" title="Salih ibn Tarif">
<text>Salih ibn Tarif () was the second king of the Berghouata kingdom, the prophet of a new Abrahamic religion, and the eponymous ancestor of the Oulad Salah tribe of Morocco. He appeared during the caliphate of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 744 AD. 

The eleventh century Andalusian scholars Al-Bakri reports that Salih was a Judean (Yahūd) and claimed descent from Simeon son of Jacob, son of Isaac.

He is also said to have claimed to be the final Mahdi, and that Isa (Jesus) would be his companion and pray behind him. He proclaimed that his name in Arabic was Ṣāliḥ, in Syriac Mālik, in &quot;Persian&quot; &quot;ālim&quot;, in Hebrew &quot;Rūbyā&quot;, and in Berber &quot;Werba&quot;, and that after him would be no other prophet.

After reaching the age of 47 years, he headed east out of the kingdom, and promised to return in the reign of their seventh king. He told his son Ilyās to support the Umayyads of Andalus and publicly profess Islam, but to reveal his religion when he became powerful enough; the latter was done by his grandson Yūnus.

According to some sources, Ṣāliḥ ibn Ṭarīf regarded himself as a successor to Muhammad, had 10 Ṣahāba (disciples) and many wives, and claimed to be able to speak with the dead and heal the sick.

Other tenets that contrast with Islam include capital punishment for theft, unlimited number of wives a man allowed to have, fasting of the month of Rajab (7th month in lunar calendar) instead of Ramadan (9th month), ten obligatory daily prayers instead of five, differences in how to perform ablution, prayers, and the banning of marriage between cousins. The details of the tenets of Ṣāliḥ&#x27;s religion are mentioned in many Arabic sources, such as Ibn Hazm, Ibn Khaldun and others.

In Islamic literature, his belief is considered heretical; politically, its motivation was presumably to establish their independence from the Umayyads (in a manner analogous to Kharijism, and earlier Donatism), establishing an independent ideology lending legitimacy to the state. Some modern Berber activists consider him to be Berber and regard him as a hero for his resistance to Umayyad-Arab conquest and his foundation of the Berghouata state.

The religion promoted by Ṣāliḥ was destroyed in the 11th century by the Almoravids.

<text>The Last Married Couple in America is a 1980 comedy film released in the US.

It was directed by Gilbert Cates, whose most successful film &quot;Oh, God! Book II&quot;, was released in the same year. The film starred George Segal and Natalie Wood as a California couple in the late 1970s struggling to maintain their &quot;happily married&quot; status as all their friends begin to get divorces and seem to be caught up in the decadence of the sexual revolution and the &quot;ME&quot; era. This is the last completed theatrical release Natalie Wood made before her death in 1981.

==Plot==

Life is going along smoothly for Jeff and Mari Thompson but not for any other couple they know, or so it seems. Everyone they know is getting divorced.

Their life is disrupted when Mari&#x27;s old college friend, Barbara, comes into it and begins a fling with Jeff, which causes Mari to contemplate an affair of her own.

==Music==
The theme song to this film is &quot;We Could Have It All,&quot; sung by Maureen McGovern. The song became a hit on the adult contemporary charts of Canada (#6) and the U.S. (#16). It was written by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel. Also featured on the soundtrack is Denise LaSalle&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Trippin&#x27; on You&quot;, which was released as a single in 1981.

<text>Cainan (from &quot;Qēnān&quot;) is mentioned in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Book of Genesis, the Book of Jubilees and the genealogy of Jesus given in Luke 3:36 in the New Testament. He is described as a son of Arpachshad and father of Salah, who lived in the time between Noah and Abraham. 

The postdiluvian Cainan does not appear in the Masoretic Text, the most common Hebrew version of Genesis, where Arpachshad is noted as the father of Salah. He is also omitted from the Samaritan Pentateuch and the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus. Helen Jacobus has argued that the omission from the Masoretic text is deliberate.

Despite his name being omitted from the Masoretic text, a substantial number of traditions about this other Cainan exist in the history of literature:

According to the &quot;Book of Jubilees&quot;, Cainan was taught to read by his father, and he found, carved on the rocks by former generations, an inscription preserving the science of astrology as taught by the Watchers, who had rebelled from God before the deluge. He is also stated to have married a daughter of Madai named Melka. 

In &quot;The Patriarchal Age: or, the History and Religion of Mankind&quot; (1854), George Smith writes:The Alexandrian World Chronicle states:And Arphaxad begat Cainan, from whom the Samaritans from the east come from. And Cainan begat Salathee, whence the Salathees are made. 
(Latin: Et arfaxad genuit cainan, unde fiunt qui ab oriente samaritae. Cainan autem genuit Salathee, unde fiunt Salathii.)

<text>World of Wonders is the third novel in Robertson Davies&#x27;s Deptford Trilogy.

First published by Macmillan of Canada in 1975, this novel focuses on the life-story of the fictional conjuror Magnus Eisengrim.

== Plot ==
Magnus Eisengrim (also known by at least four other names throughout the trilogy) tells the story of his life to a group of filmmakers who are producing a biographical film about the great magician Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin for the BBC. They are headed by the world-famous Swedish director Jurgen Lind (evidently modeled on Ingmar Bergman). Also present during the story are Eisengrim&#x27;s friends Dunstan Ramsay and Liesl, who both appear in the earlier installments of the Deptford Trilogy. Ramsay reprises the role of narrator which he played in the first novel, &quot;Fifth Business&quot;, but in this case it is only to add context and continuity to the internal narration of Eisengrim. The life story of Eisengrim pulls together many events found throughout the previous two novels, showing them from a different perspective.

== Section summary ==

=== A Bottle in the Smoke ===
This section deals with Paul&#x27;s life travelling with Wanless World of Wonders carnival as well as playing in vaudeville theatres during the winters. The section title derives from the biblical reference to a bottle as a goatskin that has been cured and hardened by smoke from a fire. Paul has similarly been hardened by his experiences at the hands of Willard, the magician who abducts Paul and subjects him to sexual abuse.

=== Merlin&#x27;s Laugh ===
In this section, Paul has arrived in London and is recruited as a stunt double to Sir John Tresize, actor-manager of a stage company. After playing stages in London and elsewhere in Britain, the troop does a long tour in Canada. Paul, who is called Mungo Fetch within the company, is strongly influenced by both Tresize and his wife, &quot;Milady&quot;. In the telling, Magnus reveals that Ingestree as a young man had also joined Tresize&#x27;s troop and had embarrassed himself in several ways. Magnus also shows how Ingestree later revenged himself on Tresize by a spiteful act.

=== Le Lit de Justice ===
In this epilogue section, Liesl, Magnus, and Dunstan share a large bed (&quot;lit&quot;) in the Savoy hotel in London after the completion of the film. Dunstan and Liesl question Magnus based on his earlier revelations, and the mystery of the death of Boy Staunton is finally resolved.

== Primary characters ==
* Magnus Eisengrim – As the main focus of the novel, much of the story revolves around Eisengrim telling his life story in order to explain his context for playing the character of Robert Houdin.
* Dunstan Ramsay – The narrator and good friend of both Eisengrim and Liesl.
* Liesl
* Jurgen Lind
* Roland Ingestree – Executive producer of the film for the BBC
* Kinghovn – Lind&#x27;s cameraman

== Themes ==
The book contains an extended treatment of the paedophilic abuse inflicted on the young Eisengrim by his abductor who repeatedly sodomizes him and uses him to obtain morphine, but in turn teaches him hand magic.

In light of its recurring focus on theatre and performance, scholars such as Katrina Dunn have discussed World of Wonders as theatre-fiction.

== References ==
Canadian magician David Ben in collaboration with former CBC Television director Patrick Watson produced in the 1990s a stage magic show inspired by many of the elements in World of Wonders.

<text>Joan Garcia Oliver (1901–1980) was a Catalan anarcho-syndicalist revolutionary and Minister of Justice of the Second Spanish Republic. He was a leading figure of anarchism in Spain.

== Career ==
===Childhood and family===
Joan Garcia Oliver was born on 20 January 1901, in Reus, Baix Camp, into a working class family. He was the son of Antònia Oliver Figueras, a native of Reus, and José Garcia Alba, a native of Xàtiva. At that time, the family lived at 32 Carrer Sant Elias in the old town of Reus. Joan was the son of his father&#x27;s second marriage, after being widowed, and he had four siblings, Elvira, Mercè, Pere and Antònia, and three half-siblings, Josep, Dídac and Lluïsa; but their step-siblings did not live with them, instead they lived in Cambrils.

His brother Pere died of meningitis at the age of 7, when Joan was still very young. As a result the family had to go into debt and their mother had to start working on the street. When he was 7 years old, he was able to receive primary education for a few months. But, as a result of the birth of his sister Antònia and the beginning of a strike at the Vapor Nou where his father worked, he was forced to temporarily leave his studies and start working. He worked as a boy, earning one real a day in a small bag factory. In spite of everything, Joan was able to resume his primary studies at the age of 8 in the school of the republican teacher Grau, after passing an entrance exam. His primary schooling finished when he turned 11 years old.

As a young man, Joan Garcia worked in the wine trading house of Lluís Quer&#x27;s widow, earning 5 pesetas a month, for three years. In the autumn of 1914, at the age of only thirteen and tired of routine work, he decided to escape to France in search of work; he had only a basic knowledge of French which he had learned self-taught. When he was near the border and without money, he realized that this had not been a good idea and returned to Reus. Later, he worked temporarily in several restaurants. First, at the La Nacional inn for 20 pesetas a month, then at the Sport Bar restaurant for a peseta a day and finally, at the Hotel Nacional de Tarragona for 50 pesetas a month. At the age of fifteen, he decided to move to Barcelona to find work and began working as a waiter at La Ibérica del Padre and later at the second-class inn Hotel Jardín.

===Social awareness===
In Barcelona, the young Garcia Oliver was in a time of great social unrest and intense union struggle. Garcia Oliver experienced the general strike of 1917 as an observer; it was his second experience in a social conflict. Tired of his job as a waiter at the Hotel Jardín, he left and started working at the Las Palmeras bar-restaurant in the Boqueria market. He took a seasonal job as a waiter at the Colònia Puig de Montserrat in the spring of 1918 and, after completing it, at the Hotel Restaurant La Española in Carrer de la Boqueria, where he apprenticed as a cook. In this last job he began to attend the conferences of the Society of Waiters Alliance, that took place in the Cabanyes street.

===Anarcho-syndicalism===
In 1919 he first joined the Society of Waiters L&#x27;Aliança, a member of the UGT, but later participated in the formation of the Union of the Hospitality Industry, Restaurants, Cafes and Annexes which was integrated into the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Garcia Oliver later organized workers in Reus, led the CNT&#x27;s provincial committee and was jailed during a strike action.

In 1922, he took part in the formation of the &quot;Los Solidarios&quot; direct action group which, in 1923, assassinated Cardinal Juan Soldevila y Romero in Zaragoza and General Secretary of the Sindicatos Libres Joan Laguía Lliteras in Manresa. Garcia Oliver subsequently worked as a polisher in France, where he unsuccessfully plotted to kill Alfonso XIII and Benito Mussolini. Upon his reentry to Catalunya in 1924, he was arrested in Manresa and imprisoned in Burgos, before being moved to Pamplona in 1926. He was released when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed and returned to Barcelona, where he joined the Iberian Anarchist Federation (, FAI). He is said to have invented the red and black flag of the CNT, which was first exhibited on 1 May 1931. He was secretary of the FAI and attended the third confederal congress of the CNT in Madrid from 10 to 16 June 1931, where he declared that it was necessary to launch into the revolution without waiting.

In 1932 he took part in the Alt Llobregat insurrection and was imprisoned again. He promoted the formation of the National Revolutionary Committee (which was based in Badalona) and led the January 1933 insurrection, which landed him back in prison. He was released after the electoral victory of the left in February 1936 elections. He participated in the IV Congress of the CNT in Zaragoza in May 1936, and anticipating the military uprising, he was part of the group that sought the supply of weapons. However, this project was not adopted because of the attitude of Federica Montseny and Diego Abad de Santillán, among others. After the July days of fighting in Barcelona, a plenary session of local and regional groups took place on 23 July. Garcia Oliver and the district of Baix Llobregat proposed the proclamation of libertarian communism, but there was unanimity against it. He promoted the formation of the Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia and organized the Harriers Column, which he marched with to the Aragon front. But he was called back to Barcelona to act as a representative of the CNT in the Committee, as the head of the War Department.

On 4 November 1936, the CNT decided to join the war government of Francisco Largo Caballero, with Garcia Oliver acting as the Minister of Justice. He began organizing the &quot;People&#x27;s War Schools&quot; and set up work camps for political detainees. In his tenure as minister, court fees were abolished and criminal records destroyed. In Barcelona there were a series of confrontations between revolutionary groups and the republican government, known as the May Days. Garcia Oliver urged the Barcelona CNT to abandon the struggle that had broken out in the streets, and called for a ceasefire. With the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939, he settled in Sweden, Venezuela and finally Mexico. In 1978, two years before his death, Garcia Oliver published his autobiography, &quot;El eco de los pasos&quot;.

<doc id="649206" wikidata="Q777609" url="?curid=649206" title="Jean Hotman, Marquis de Villers-St-Paul">
<text>Jean Hotman, Marquis de Villiers-St-Paul (1552 – 1636) was a French diplomat. Although he came from a Calvinist family, who had been exiled during the French Wars of Religion, Jean, through cultivating connections with Henry IV eventually was restored to a portion of his patrimony.

==Early life==
Hotman was the eldest son of the famous jurist and author François Hotman. He was born in Lausanne because his family was in exile during the Wars of Religion in France. His father, although heir to an estate, did not take the title of Marquis because his adherence to Protestantism distanced him from his extended family.

Due in part to the religious conflicts, the family moved often. From 1555 to 1563, they were in Strasbourg, from 1563 to 1566 in Valence, from 1566 to 1572, in Bourges, from 1572 to 1578 in Geneva. In 1578, they moved for the last time to Basel where Jean&#x27;s father Francis would die in 1590.

Jean studied law at Valence, graduating before 1568. He later went to Paris in 1578, and through his father&#x27;s influence, was named a tutor in the household of the English Ambassador to Paris, Sir Amias Paulet (ambassador 1576–1579). He tutored Amias&#x27; two sons, Anthony and George. When Amias was recalled to England in November 1579, Jean followed him there to continue tutoring his sons. Sir Francis Bacon also traveled with Sir Amias during this time 1577–78, and it is possible they knew each other.

==Middle life==
In March 1580, Jean, Anthony and George settled at Oxford where he became acquainted with many current or soon-to-be famous persons. Jean graduated from the University of Oxford in 1581, with a doctorate in law. Anthony Paulet would later receive an M.A. and eventually succeeded his father as Governor of Jersey(see DNB, XV, pg 527). His three-years-younger brother George took another route with a good marriage (see DNB, XV, pg 528).

While at Oxford, Jean fell in with a group of fellows including Richard Hakluyt, Henry Cuffe (1563–1601) and Sir Philip Sidney. Through Philip Sidney and Amias Paulet, Hotman caught the attention of Philip&#x27;s uncle Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the Chancellor of the University, who around May/Oct 1582, engaged him as one of his secretaries. This brought Hotman to the court of Queen Elizabeth.

Despite this, he moved back to the continent. He was at Caen in 1584, where he was nominated &quot;prieur du college des droits&quot;, but he left when they would not pay him. About 1584 or 1585, he was married, probably in France, to Renee de St Martin, the former lady-in-waiting to Penelope Devereux, Lady Rich. And on 14 January 1585, he was appointed counsellor and master of requests by Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV.

He returned to England, where he followed Leicester to the Low Countries in May 1585, and when Leicester returned to England, he left Hotman behind as his agent, with the special commission to pacify the troubles in Utrecht. He performed this task well and wrote to Leicester but had the effrontery to write directly to Queen Elizabeth for which Leicester upbraided him. This did not lead to a permanent breach for &quot;When Leicester after his second stay in the Netherlands, returned to England (Dec 1587), Hotman was one of his retinue.&quot; (Posthumus, pg 40)

In 1588, he was appointed Prebendary of Ilfracombe with an income of 28 pounds, although mostly eaten up by taxes and expenses. In March 1588, he was entered at Gray&#x27;s Inn, but apparently did not embark on a legal career.

==In Scotland==
In August 1589 Hotman travelled to Scotland, to Edinburgh and then met the king James VI at Falkland Palace. James VI gave him a jewel and a ring with a diamond set in a star. Hotman left Edinburgh and stayed at Whittingehame Tower on 20 August 1589 with Richard Douglas. He may have travelled in the company of the poet Henry Constable.

==Later life==
Upon the death of his father in 1590, he returned to France to settle the estate and became the guardian of his three unmarried sisters. One of these, Suzanne has a marriage contract dated 1594 in Paris. She is perhaps the most well-known of his sisters, having known modern descendants in Canada and the United States, which has made her and especially her husband, the subject of a few scholarly articles.

Hotman wrote a treatise that was published in 1603 called &quot;L&#x27;ambassadeur&quot; (The Ambassador); it was the first diplomatic manual written in the French language and was also translated into English. In it he warned diplomats against hiring servants from the country to which they were assigned for fear these hirelings would act as spies. He even recommended that ambassadors take their wives with them to supervise their households in order to prevent its members from revealing sensitive information to outsiders. On the topic of court entertainment, Hotman maintained that, while there were advantages to engaging with festivities, ambassadors should not be swayed by flattery or impressive displays. Ambassadors were also advised to avoid drinking or playing games since it could reflect poorly on the head of state they were representing.

At one point, he apparently received in France the title of &quot;Comte&quot; (Count) d&#x27;Hotman. Sometime before 1619, he was French ambassador to the Duchy of Berg at Düsseldorf.

<doc id="649208" wikidata="Q7602595" url="?curid=649208" title="Starting fluid">
<text>Starting fluid is a volatile, flammable liquid which is used to aid the starting of internal combustion engines, especially during cold weather or in engines that are difficult to start using conventional starting procedures. It is typically available in an aerosol spray can, and may sometimes be used for starting direct injected diesel engines or lean burn spark engines running on alcohol fuel. Some modern starting fluid products contain mostly volatile hydrocarbons such as heptane (the main component of natural gasoline), with a small portion of diethyl ether, and carbon dioxide (as a propellant). Some formulations contain butane or propane as both propellant and starting fuel. Historically, diethyl ether, with a small amount of oil, a trace amount of a stabilizer and a hydrocarbon propellant has been used to help start internal combustion engines because of its low autoignition temperature.

Diethyl ether is distinct from petroleum ether (a crude oil distillate consisting mostly of pentane and other alkanes) which has also been used for starting engines.

==Usage==

===Four stroke engines===
Starting fluid is sprayed into the engine intake near the air filter, or into the carburetor bore or a spark plug hole of an engine to get added fuel to the combustion cylinder quickly. Using starting fluid to get the engine running faster avoids wear to starters and fatigue to one&#x27;s arm with pull start engines, especially on rarely used machines. Other uses include cold weather starting, vehicles that run out of fuel and thus require extra time to restore fuel pressure, and sometimes with flooded engines. Mechanics sometimes use it to diagnose starting problems by determining whether the spark and ignition system of the vehicle is functioning; if the spark is adequate but the fuel delivery system is not, the engine will run until the starting fluid vapors are consumed. It is used more often with carbureted engines than with fuel injection systems. Caution is required when using starting fluid with diesel engines that have preheat systems in the intake or glow-plugs installed, as the starting fluid may pre-ignite, leading to engine damage.

===Two stroke engines===
Starting fluid is not recommended for regular use with some two-stroke engines because it does not possess lubricating qualities by itself. Lubrication for two-stroke engines is achieved using oil that is either mixed into the fuel by the user or injected automatically into the fuel supply; engines requiring premixed fuel that are run solely on starting fluid do not receive an adequate supply of lubrication to their crankcase and cylinder(s). Engines that haven&#x27;t been run recently are especially vulnerable to damage from oil starvation; starting fluid, a strong solvent, tends to strip residual oil off of cranks and cylinder walls, further reducing lubrication during the period of fuel starvation. WD-40 was previously recommended for use on two stroke engines because it has lubricating qualities, but the formulation with non-flammable CO2 as propellant instead of propane no longer has the same combustible nature, making it useless as starting fluid on any type of engine.

===Abuse===
Diethyl ether has a long history as a medical anesthetic; when starting fluid was mostly ether, a similar effect could be obtained using it. Use at the present time directly as an inhalant includes the effect of the petroleum solvents, which are more toxic as inhalants than diethyl ether.

Sometimes referred to as &quot;passing the shirt,&quot; the starting fluid is sprayed on a piece of cloth and held up to one&#x27;s face for inhalation. This trend has gradually picked up since the turn of the century, as phrases such as &quot;etherized&quot; and &quot;ethervision&quot; have gained popularity. The effects of inhalation vary, but have been known to include lightheadedness, loss of coordination, paranoia, and sometimes hallucinations.

<text>The China Academy of Art (CAA; ) is one of the most prestigious top colleges of fine arts in China, and is the first national comprehensive institution of higher art education in modern China. It is recognized as the country&#x27;s First-Class Discipline Construction University.

The China Academy of Art was founded in 1928 and was called the National Academy of Art; in 1929, it was renamed the National Hangzhou Art College; in 1938, it was renamed the National Art College. In 1950, it became the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts; in 1958, it was renamed Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts; in 1993, it was renamed China Academy of Art. Before 2000, it was under the management of the Ministry of Culture. In 2000, it became a university jointly built by the province and the ministry. In 2016, it was approved to become a university jointly funded by the Zhejiang Provincial People’s Government, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Culture.

==Introduction==
China Academy of Art is the most influential academy of fine arts with the most complete range of degree offerings and programs of study in China. It houses a diverse pool of artistic talent, has a distinctive structure integrating theory and practice, focuses on human care and social needs, and combines modern technical and cultural disciplines with traditional artistic ones. The academy features the study of theories and offers Ph.D., Master&#x27;s, and bachelor&#x27;s degrees of fine arts, design, architecture, film, and new media, which constitute the humanities and reflect the Chinese national spirit and creative theories of the era.

There are 9,774 undergraduate and graduate students on four campuses with a faculty and staff of 888. The administration is headquartered on the Nanshan Campus, by the West Lake in Hangzhou. Some of the students in the Master&#x27;s programs live on the alternate campus 40 minutes away, on the outskirts of Hangzhou. A free bus is offered to transport students to and from the campus and the dorms at designated times.

Undergraduate students typically spend one year in general education courses in the School of Foundation Studies and then three years in the core courses of their chosen majors. Graduate courses are typically three years long and include experience in the studio and research with mentoring faculty.

==History==
In 1928, the National Academy of Art (國立藝術院) was founded in China on the bank of the West Lake in Hangzhou by the educators Cai Yuanpei and Lin Fengmian. It was administered by Yi Tingbai and Zhuang Ziman during the 1940s. Over the decades, the locations of the academy had changed ten times and its name, five times, as follows:

*1928 - National Academy of Art (國立藝術院)
**National Academy of Art was the first Chinese art university and graduate school
*1929 - Hangzhou National College of Art (國立杭州藝術專科學校)
**The Western painting department was divided into several studios. Most of them practiced modern, semiabstract styles. The atmosphere was very similar to that of an American art college in its freedom of expression. After the second year of their five-year program, students would choose a studio where they would like to continue their studies. Lin Fengmian advocated the synthesis of Chinese and modern Western art, and urged students not to emulate his work but develop their own styles. Among the other professors, Wu Dayu taught late impressionist and cubist styles; Fang Ganmin was influenced by Cubism; and Guan Liang taught a style derived from Fauvism. Although the students were strictly trained in academic drawing, they were encouraged to express themselves freely and be creative.
*1938 - National College of Art (國立藝術專科學校)
**The Sino-Japanese War broke out, the National Beiping School of Art merged into the National Hangzhou School of Art, and a new national school was formed.
* 1945 - After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Academy was reopened in Hangzhou with the Chinese painter Pan Tianshou as its director.
**The establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China saw a shift in the government&#x27;s attitude to, and policy on, art and art education. Many of the senior faculty members of the then National Academy of Art, particularly those practiced modern Western art, failed to understand or refused to accept the revolutionary ideologies and principles. Many, including Lin Fengmian, Fang Ganmin, Wu Dayu, and Guan Liang, gradually went back to Shanghai. Others, including the traditionalist Pan Tianshou, were reassigned to minor administrative positions, and were no longer allowed to teach. They were soon replaced by fresh graduates who had successfully mastered the revolutionary styles and principles.
*1950 - East-China Campus of Central Academy of Fine Arts (中央美術學院華東分院)
**After the Civil War, the CPC (中國共產黨) took over mainland China and founded a new art academy, CAFA, in Beijing to solidify Beijing&#x27;s status as the new capital. As a national academy founded by the KMT (中國國民黨) government, CAA was ordered to change its name to East China Campus of CAFA. CAA then changed its name, but did not merge with CAFA; the two academies remained independent and were not subordinate to one another.
**There were also a couple of similar cases, The Shanghai Conservatory of Music (上海音樂學院), whose original name was The National Conservatory of Music (國立音樂院), and The Shanghai Theater Academy (上海戲劇學院), were ordered to change their names to East China Campus of central academies.
*1958 - Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (浙江美術學院)
*1978 - The Academy recruited high school graduates again.
*1993 - China Academy of Art (中國美術學院)
**China National Academy of Fine Arts, called China Academy of Art for short, on November 16, with the endorsement of the Ministry of Culture, PRC. Finally, CAA rehabilitated its national appellation.

<text>In heraldry, cadency is any systematic way to distinguish arms displayed by descendants of the holder of a coat of arms when those family members have not been granted arms in their own right. Cadency is necessary in heraldic systems in which a given design may be owned by only one person at any time, generally the head of the senior line of a particular family.

As an armiger&#x27;s arms may be used &#x27;by courtesy&#x27;, either by children or spouses, while they are still living, some form of differencing may be required so as not to confuse them with the original undifferenced or &quot;plain coat&quot; arms. Historically, arms were only heritable by males, and therefore cadency marks had no relevance to daughters; in the modern era, Canadian and Irish heraldry include daughters in cadency.

These differences are formed by adding to the arms small and inconspicuous marks called brisures, similar to charges but smaller. They are typically placed on the fess point (the centre of the field), or in chief (the upper part of the field) in the case of the label. Brisures are generally exempt from the rule of tincture. One of the best examples of usage from the medieval period is shown on the seven Beauchamp cadets in the stained-glass windows of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Warwick.

== Background ==
Historically, it was recognised that there was a need to difference the arms of the head of the family from those of cadets. This need was recognised in Europe during the 14th century; various means to accomplish this were used.

In the modern era, differencing arms is generally rarely done in continental Europe. It is only in Scotland where the need to difference cadets is enforced.

== Ways of differencing ==

In heraldry&#x27;s early period, uniqueness of arms was obtained by a wide variety of ways, including:
*changing tincture
*adding a label or bordure
*adding, removing, or replacing an &quot;ordinary&quot;. 
*varying the lines of partition of an ordinary
*the use of &quot;brisures&quot; or marks of difference

See Armorial of Capetians and Armorial of Plantagenet for an illustration of the variety.

== Systems derived from English and Scottish usage==
Systematic cadency schemes later developed in England and Scotland, but while in England they are voluntary (and not always observed), in Scotland they are enforced through the statutorily required process of matriculation in the Public Register.

=== England ===

The English system of cadency allows nuclear family members to personally use the arms of the head of that family &#x27;by courtesy&#x27;. This involves the addition of a &quot;brisure&quot;, or mark of difference to the original coat of arms. The brisure identifies the bearer&#x27;s family relationship to the actual bearer of the arms. Although there is some debate over how strictly the system should be followed, the accepted system is shown below:

Daughters have no special brisures, and normally use their father&#x27;s arms on a lozenge, which includes any marks of cadency their father may use. This is because English heraldry has no requirement that women&#x27;s arms be unique. Upon marriage, they impale their father&#x27;s arms to the sinister with those of their husband to the dexter. However, if the woman happens to be a heraldic heiress, her father&#x27;s arms are borne on an inescutcheon on her husband&#x27;s arms.

In England, arms are generally the property of their owner from birth, subject to the use of the appropriate mark of cadency. Therefore, it is not necessary to wait for the death of the previous generation before arms are inherited.

The eldest son of an eldest son uses a label of five points. Other grandchildren combine the brisure of their father with the relevant brisure of their own. This could lead to confusion, as both an uncle and nephew could have the same cadency mark. In a short number of generations, the accumulation of cadency marks—to show, for example, the fifth son of a third son of a second son—could lead to added complexity. In practice, cadency marks are not much used in England, and even when they are, it is rare to see more than one or two on a coat of arms.

At times, arms with a cadency mark may be used on a hereditary basis. For instance, the arms of the Earls Russell are those of the Duke of Bedford differenced by a mullet, as the 1st Earl was the third son of the 6th Duke.

Although most heraldic texts follow on the English system of cadency set out above, most heraldic examples (whether on old bookplates, church monuments, silver and the like) ignore cadency marks altogether. Oswald Barron noted:

Nor have cadency marks usually been insisted upon by the College of Arms, the heraldic authority for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. For example, a statement on their website refers to the optional nature of cadency marks:

In correspondence published in the Heraldry Society&#x27;s newsletter, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones firmly rejected a suggestion that cadency marks should be strictly enforced. He said:

In a second letter published at the same time, he wrote:

==== Adopted children ====
Clarenceux King of Arms John Brooke-Little wrote that &quot;adopted children may be granted the arms of their adoptive father, but a Royal License must be sought, and the arms, when granted, are differences by the addition of two links of a chain interlaced, either fesswise or palewise...&quot;

=== Scotland ===
The system is very different in Scotland, where every male user of a coat of arms may only use arms recorded, or &quot;matriculated&quot;, in the Public Register with a personal variation, appropriate to that person&#x27;s position in their family, approved by the heraldic authority for Scotland, the Lord Lyon. This means that in Scotland no two men can ever simultaneously bear the same arms, even by accident, if they have submitted their position to the Scottish heraldic authorities (which not all do in practice, in Scotland as in England); if they have not done so, the matter falls under statute law and may result in proceedings in the Lyon Court, which is part of the Scots criminal justice system. To this extent, the law of arms is stricter in Scotland than in England where the only legal action possible is a civil action in the Court of Chivalry, which sits extremely rarely and is not an integrated part of the English justice system.

Scotland, like England, uses the label of three points for the eldest son (or female heir presumptive) and a label of five points for the eldest son of the eldest son, and allows the label to be removed as the bearer of the plain coat dies and the eldest son succeeds.
For cadets other than immediate heirs, Scottish cadency uses a complex and versatile system, applying different kinds of changes in each generation. First, a bordure is added in a different tincture for each brother. In subsequent generations the bordure may be divided in two tinctures; the edge of the bordure, or of an ordinary in the base coat, may be changed from straight to indented, engrailed or invected; charges may be added. These variations allow the family tree to be expressed clearly and unambiguously. The system outlined here is a very rough version that gives a flavour of the real thing.

In the Scots heraldic system (which has little to do with the clan system), only one bearer of any given surname may bear plain arms. Other armigerous persons with the same surname usually have arms derived from the same plain coat; though if actual kinship cannot be established, they must be differenced in a way other than the cadency system mentioned above.

=== Canada ===
Canadian cadency generally follows the English system. However, since in Canadian heraldry a coat of arms must be unique regardless of the bearer&#x27;s sex, Canada has developed a series of brisures for daughters unique to Canada:

* for the first daughter, a heart;
* for the second daughter, an ermine spot;
* for the third daughter, a snowflake;
* for the fourth daughter, a fir twig;
* for the fifth daughter, a chess rook
* for the sixth daughter, an escallop (scallop shell);
* for the seventh daughter, a harp;
* for the eighth daughter, a buckle;
* for the ninth daughter, a clarion.

The actual practice in Canada is far from the rigidity suggested by the list of differences above – and is best seen in action in the Canadian Public Register – see for example the coats of various Armstrongs, Ravignats and Bradfords.

=== South Africa ===

Personal arms registered at the Bureau of Heraldry may be differenced upon matriculation (which is voluntary). Current policy is that younger children&#x27;s arms must be differenced if they are matriculated. Methods used include the English and Scottish systems, the substitution of different charges, the changing of lines, and the changing of tinctures and or adding a border to the shield.

=== Ireland ===

The brisures used in the arms granted by the Chief Herald of the Republic of Ireland are identical to the brisures used by the system used in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but unlike the English system, which only uses these brisures for the sons of an armiger in order of birth, the Irish system applies them to all the children of the armiger, irrespective of sex, and, as illegitimacy has no place in Irish heraldry, these marks are assigned to (recognised) children born outside of marriage as well as inside.

=== British royal family ===


There are no actual &quot;rules&quot; for members of the royal family, because their arms are theoretically decided &quot;ad hoc&quot; by the monarch. In practice, however, a number of traditions are practically invariably followed. At birth, members of the royal family have no arms. At some point during their lives, generally at the age of eighteen, they may be granted arms of their own. These will always be the &quot;arms of dominion&quot; of the monarch with a label argent for difference; the label may have three or five points. Since this is in theory a new grant, the label is applied not only to the shield but also to the crest and the supporters to ensure uniqueness. Though &quot;de facto&quot; in English heraldry the crest is uncharged (although it is supposed to be in theory), as it would accumulate more and more cadency marks with each generation, the marks eventually becoming indistinguishable, the crests of the royal family are always shown as charged.

Each Prince of Wales uses a plain white label and (since 1911) an inescutcheon of the ancient arms of the Principality of Wales. Traditionally, the other members of the family have used a stock series of symbols (cross of Saint George, heart, anchor, fleur-de-lys, etc.) on the points of the label to ensure that their arms differ. The label of the Duke of Sussex has three scallop shells taken from the arms of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales; this is sometimes called an innovation but in fact the use of maternal charges for difference is a very old practice, illustrated in the &quot;border of France&quot; (&quot;azure semé-de-lys or&quot;) borne by John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316–36), younger son of Edward II of England and Isabella of France.

It is often said that labels argent are a peculiarly royal symbol, and that eldest sons outside the royal family should use labels of a different colour, usually gules.

== Continental usages ==

=== France ===

During the Middle Ages, marks of cadency were used extensively by armigers in France. By the eighteenth century, such marks were no longer used by the members of armigerous families, but were still used extensively by the members of the French royal family.

The French Revolution of 1789 had a profound impact on heraldry, and heraldry was abolished in 1790, to be restored in 1808 by Napoleon I. However, Napoleon&#x27;s heraldic system did not use marks of cadency either; the decree of 3 March 1810 (art. 11) states: &quot;The name, arms and livery shall pass from the father to all sons&quot; although the distinctive marks of Napoleonic titles could pass only to the sons who inherited them.

No subsequent regime in France ever promulgated any legislation regarding marks of difference in heraldry, so they remain unused (except in the heraldry of sovereign houses, such as the former royal family, as can be seen below, or the House of Lorraine).

==== The former royal house ====
Examples of cadency:
==== Past usage ====
The sons of Louis VIII and Blanche of Castile used golden castles on a red background (derived from the arms of Castile) as charges to difference their arms: for Robert, a &quot;label&quot;; for Alphonse, a semy of castles; for Charles, a &quot;bordure&quot;. This initial system of differencing was dropped in favor of a longer-lasting simpler system. Charles, the youngest son of Louis VIII, changed his arms in favor of the arms of France with a plain &quot;label gules&quot;.

The simpler system primarily used four marks of difference: the &quot;label&quot;, the &quot;bordure&quot;, the &quot;bend&quot;, and the &quot;bordure engrailed&quot;. The tinctures used were gules; a compony of argent and gules; and argent. They occasionally came up with more unusual forms, such as a &quot;bordure-label gules&quot; and a &quot;bordure gules charged with eight plates&quot;.

Initially, the arms were attributed to the cadet. Thus, even when Philip the Bold exchanged his appanage of Touraine in favor of Burgundy, he retained the arms he had received as Duke of Touraine, but quartered it with the arms of Burgundy. Another example is Charles, Duke of Berry, younger brother of Louis XI.

However, by the seventeenth century, arms became associated with titles. The bordure gules was associated with Anjou, and the label argent with Orléans. Thus, when a cadet exchanged his appanage, his arms changed.

=== Germany ===

German noble houses did not use cadency marks as systematically as their European peers. The sons of noblemen often bore their father&#x27;s arms, and generally there was no obligation or expectation that they be differenced.

The most common means of differencing was the use of different heraldic crests to mark apart otherwise identical achievements borne by different branches of a family. Other, less frequent forms include counter-changing or the replacement of individual tinctures, or the addition of ordinaries. Bordures and labels were used occasionally, though not doctrinally. Perhaps the most prominent German family to adopt a system of bordures was the House of Hohenzollern.

As a result of the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s heavy fragmentation, which form saw more prominent use and when was also influenced by general trends and geographic proximity; for example, the heraldic tradition of the Low Countries and the Rhineland saw a great deal of influence by its French neighbor.

==== Former royal house====

====Royal family ====
=== Belgium ===

==== Royal family ====
The following heraldic system was adopted by a royal decree in 2019. Prior to this the system of royal cadency was unclear.

=== The Netherlands ===

====Royal family====
The following heraldic system was adopted by a royal decree in 1815 and was in effect until 1907.

Since 1907, the system has differed. Wilhelmina further decreed that in perpetuity her descendants should be styled &quot;princes and princesses of Orange-Nassau&quot; and that the name of the house would be &quot;Orange-Nassau&quot; (in Dutch &quot;Oranje-Nassau&quot;). Since then, individual members of the House of Orange-Nassau are also given their own arms by the reigning monarch, similar to the United Kingdom. This is usually the royal arms, quartered with the arms of the principality of Orange, and an in escutcheon of their paternal arms.

Since 1907, there is no system to delineate individual princes and princesses via their arms.

=== Portugal ===
The Portuguese systems of differencing have their origins in the regulations of King Manuel I, who ruled Portugal from 1495 to 1521. There are two systems, one for the non-Royal families and the other for the Royal House.

==== Noble families ====

The Portuguese system of differentiation for the noble non-Royal families is unlike any other cadency system. It is true that the brisure personalises the arms, however, since the Portuguese have an arbitrary choice of surnames, they may select any family name from the father&#x27;s or mother&#x27;s side of their genealogical table and a coat of arms, which does not have to coincide with it. Thus, the system of differencing only serves to show from which ancestral line the arms are derived. The head of the lineage uses the arms without a difference, but should he be the head of more than one family, the arms are combined by quartering. The heir apparent to the arms of the head of a lineage never uses a mark of difference.

<doc id="649234" wikidata="Q1113910" url="?curid=649234" title="Come to Daddy (EP)">
<text>Come to Daddy is an EP/mini-album by the British electronic music artist Aphex Twin. The EP&#x27;s lead single, and the first track on the EP, &quot;Come to Daddy (Pappy Mix)&quot;—often simply called &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;—is one of Aphex Twin&#x27;s best-known songs; it peaked at number 36 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Composition==
&quot;Come to Daddy&quot; has been described as featuring drum and bass beats throughout. Each mix of &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; is seemingly unrelated, with the &quot;Little Lord Faulteroy&quot; and &quot;Mummy&quot; mixes bearing no noticeable resemblance to the original &quot;Pappy&quot; mix. &quot;To Cure a Weakling Child (Contour Regard)&quot; is a remix of the song &quot;To Cure a Weakling Child&quot; from &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot;. Six of &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; eight tracks feature vocals.

According to Sean Booth of Autechre, James&#x27; track &quot;Bucephalus Bouncing Ball&quot; is a reaction to their track &quot;Drane&quot;, to which they then replied with the track &quot;Drane2&quot;.

==Packaging==
&quot;Come to Daddy&quot; packaging features stark black letters against a white background. All the information, track listings and lyrics are printed the same way, and only two images are present, both photographed by Stefan DeBatselier and digitally altered by Chris Cunningham, using James&#x27; face on children. James has used his likeness as the artwork on five of his releases: The &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot; and &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; albums, &quot;Donkey Rhubarb&quot;, &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; and the &quot;Windowlicker&quot; single.

The cover of the out-of-print second CD, with its white lettering against an orange background, makes reference to the fact that &quot;To Cure a Weakling Child&quot; had been used in a television advertisement for Orange. However, the advertisement used an edit of the album version, whilst the version that appears on the EP is the radically different &quot;Contour Regard&quot; mix.

==Track listing==
All tracks written, produced and engineered by Richard D. James.

All vinyl editions of &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; (excluding a promotional double LP limited to 500 copies) exclude tracks 5–8.

The tracks were originally released on two separate CDs, WAP94CD and WAP94CDR, with the first four tracks on the former and the rest on the latter. These have since been replaced by one EP containing all eight tracks (WAP94CDX).

<doc id="649250" wikidata="Q424161" url="?curid=649250" title="Vardenafil">
<text>Vardenafil, sold under the brand name Levitra among others, is a medication that is used for treating erectile dysfunction. It is a PDE5 inhibitor. It is taken by mouth.

==Medical use==
Vardenafil&#x27;s indications and contraindications are the same as with other PDE5 inhibitors; it is closely related in function to sildenafil citrate (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis). The difference between the vardenafil molecule and sildenafil citrate is a nitrogen atom&#x27;s position and the change of sildenafil&#x27;s piperazine ring methyl group to an ethyl group. Tadalafil is structurally different from both sildenafil and vardenafil. Vardenafil&#x27;s relatively short effective time is comparable to but somewhat longer than sildenafil&#x27;s. Despite the structural differences between vardenafil and sildenafil, they both show similar ocular side effects due to their similar selectivity overlap with PDE6, an enzyme found in the eye.

Beyond its indications for erectile dysfunction, vardenafil may be effective in the treatment of premature ejaculation, where it may significantly increase the time from penetration to ejaculation.

==Adverse reactions==
The common, adverse drug reactions (side effects) are the same as with other PDE5 inhibitors. The frequent vardenafil-specific side-effect is nausea; the infrequent side effects are abdominal pain, back pain, photosensitivity, abnormal vision, eye pain, facial edema, hypotension, palpitation, tachycardia, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, itch, and priapism.

One possibly serious, but rare, side effect with vardenafil is heart attack. Also, in rare cases, vardenafil use may cause priapism, a very painful emergency condition that can cause impotence if left untreated.

In October 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that a warning about possible deafness (sudden hearing loss) would be added to the drug labels of vardenafil, and other PDE5 inhibitors.

== Interactions ==

Vardenafil should not be used by people taking nitrate medications, because combining them with vardenafil might provoke potentially life-threatening hypotension (low blood pressure).

Further, vardenafil causes lengthening of the QT interval. Therefore, it should not be taken by people taking other medications that affect the QT interval (such as amiodarone).

==History==
Vardenafil was co-marketed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline, and Schering-Plough under the brand name Levitra. As of 2005, the co-promotion rights of GSK on Levitra have been returned to Bayer in many markets outside the US. In Italy, Bayer sells vardenafil as Levitra and GSK sells it as Vivanza. Thus, because of European Union trade rules, parallel imports might result in Vivanza sold next to Levitra in the EU.

An orally disintegrating form, marketed as Staxyn and Levitra Soft, has been gaining approvals in countries such as the United States and Canada.

==Tainted supplements==
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has found vardenafil and other synthetic PDE5 inhibitors in numerous products marketed as &quot;herbal&quot; supplements or &quot;all natural&quot; products for male enhancement.

<doc id="649257" wikidata="Q469944" url="?curid=649257" title="Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve">
<text>Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve (28 November 1685 – 29 December 1755) was a French author influenced by Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy, Charles Perrault, and various précieuse writers. Villeneuve is particularly noted for her original story of &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot;, which was published in 1740 and is the oldest known variant of the fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

== Biography ==

Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot was born and died in Paris. She belonged to a powerful Protestant family from La Rochelle and was a descendant of Amos Barbot, a Peer of France and a deputy in the Estates General in 1614. His brother, Jean Amos, became mayor of La Rochelle in 1610. Another relative, Jean Barbot (1655-1712), was an early explorer of West Africa and the Caribbean, and worked as an agent on slave ships. He published his travel journals in French and English after he migrated to England to escape the persecution of Protestants after Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685.

In 1706, Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot married Jean-Baptiste de Gaalon de Villeneuve, a member of a noble family from Poitou. Within six months of their marriage, she requested a separation of property from her husband, who had already squandered much of their substantial joint inheritance. A daughter was born, but no records indicate if she survived. In 1711, Gabrielle-Suzanne became a widow at the age of 26. She lost her fortune and was forced to seek employment to support herself. Eventually, she made her way back to Paris, where she met Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon, or Crébillon père, the most famous writer of tragedies of the period. It is likely that she began co-habitating with Crébillon père in the early 1730s, although the earliest documented date is 1748. She remained with him until her death in 1755 and assisted him with his duties as the royal literary censor. She thus became knowledgeable about the literary tastes of the Parisian reading public.

== Major works ==
Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve published both fairy tales and novels. Her publications include a novella, &quot;Le Phénix conjugal&quot; (1734, &quot;The Conjugal Phoenix&quot;); two collections of fairy tales, &quot;La Jeune Américaine, et les Contes marins&quot; (1740) and &quot;Les Belles Solitaires&quot; (1745); and four novels, &quot;Le Beau-frère supposé&quot; (1752), &quot;La Jardinière de Vincennes&quot; (1753, &quot;The Gardener of Vincennes&quot;), &quot;Le juge prévenu&quot; (1754, &quot;The Biased Judge&quot;), and &quot;Mémoires de Mesdemoiselles de Marsange&quot; (1757, &quot;Memoirs of Mlles de Marsange&quot;). &quot;La Jardinière de Vincennes&quot; was considered her masterpiece and gave her her greatest commercial success. The &quot;Bibliographie du genre romanesque français 1751-1800&quot; lists 15 editions of this novel.

=== &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; ===
Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve is particularly noted for her original story of &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot;, which was published in her &quot;La jeune américaine, et les contes marins&quot; in 1740, and is the oldest known modern variant of the fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. This book, which is as long as a conventional novel, was influenced by the style of 17th-century novels and contains many subplots or intercalated stories, one of which is the story of Beauty and the Beast. The Beast is &quot;bête&quot; in both senses of the French word: both a beast and lacking in intelligence. After her death, Villeneuve&#x27;s tale was abridged, rewritten, and published by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 in her &quot;Magasin des enfants&quot; to teach young English girls a moral lesson. In her widely popular publication, Leprince de Beaumont gave no credit to Villeneuve and thus she is often wrongly referred to as the author of the tale. Her shortened version is the one most commonly known today.

The Beast, a prince, loses his father at a young age. His mother has to wage war to defend his kingdom, and leaves him in the care of an evil fairy. This fairy attempts to seduce him when he reaches adulthood. He rejects her and she transforms him into a beast. He must remain in this form until someone agrees to marry him without knowing his past. In a neighboring kingdom, Beauty is the daughter of a king and a different fairy. Beauty&#x27;s mother has broken the laws of fairy society by falling in love with a human, so she is sentenced to remain in the fairy land and Beauty is sentenced to marry a hideous beast when she grows up (the same beast that the prince was turned into). After Beauty&#x27;s mother disappears, the evil fairy unsuccessfully attempts to take Beauty&#x27;s life and marry her father. Beauty&#x27;s aunt, another good fairy, intervenes and exchanges Beauty for the dead daughter of a merchant. She also places the Beast in a magically hidden castle until Beauty grows old enough to meet him.

<doc id="649259" wikidata="Q107172" url="?curid=649259" title="Chromite">
<text>Chromite is a crystalline mineral composed primarily of iron(II) oxide and chromium(III) oxide compounds. It can be represented by the chemical formula of FeCr2O4. It is an oxide mineral belonging to the spinel group. The element magnesium can substitute for iron in variable amounts as it forms a solid solution with magnesiochromite (MgCr2O4). Substitution of the element aluminium can also occur, leading to hercynite (FeAl2O4). Chromite today is mined particularly to make stainless steel through the production of ferrochrome (FeCr), which is an iron-chromium alloy.

Chromite grains are commonly found in large mafic igneous intrusions such as the Bushveld in South Africa and India. Chromite is iron-black in color with a metallic luster, a dark brown streak and a hardness on the Mohs scale of 5.5. 
== Properties ==
Chromite minerals are mainly found in mafic-ultramafic igneous intrusions and are also sometimes found in metamorphic rocks. The chromite minerals occur in layered formations that can be hundreds of kilometres long and a few meters thick. Chromite is also common in iron meteorites and form in association with silicates and troilite minerals.

=== Crystal structure ===
The chemical composition of chromite can be represented as FeCr2O4, with the iron in the +2 oxidation state and the chromium in the +3 oxidation state. bauxite, when presented as an ore, or in massive form, forms as fine granular aggregates. The structure of the ore can be seen as platy, with breakages along planes of weakness. Chromite can also be presented in a thin section. The grains seen in thin sections are disseminated with crystals that are euhedral to subhedral.

Chromite contains Mg, ferrous iron [Fe(II)], Al and trace amounts of Ti. Chromite can change into different minerals based on the amounts of each element in the mineral. Chromite is a part of the spinel group, which means that it is able to form a complete solid solution series with other members in the same group. These include minerals such as chenmingite (FeCr2O4), xieite (FeCr2O4), magnesiochromite (MgCr2O4) and magnetite (Fe2+Fe3+2O4). Chenmingite and xieite are polymorphs of chromite while magnesiochromite and magnetite are isostructural with chromite.

=== Crystal size and morphology ===
Chromite occurs as massive and granular crystals and very rarely as octahedral crystals. Twinning for this mineral occurs on the {III} plane as described by the spinel law.

Grains of minerals are generally small in size. However, chromite grains up to 3 cm have been found. These grains are seen to crystallize from the liquid of a meteorite body where there are low amounts of chromium and oxygen. The large grains are associated with stable supersaturated conditions seen from the meteorite body.

=== Reactions ===
Chromite is an important mineral in helping to determine the conditions that rocks form. It can have reactions with various gases such as CO and CO2. The reaction between these gases and the solid chromite grains results in the reduction of the chromite and allows for the formation of iron and chromium alloys. There could also be a formation of metal carbides from the interaction with chromite and the gases.

Chromite is seen to form early in the crystallization process. This allows for chromite to be resistant to the alteration effects of high temperatures and pressures seen in the metamorphic series. It is able to progress through the metamorphic series unaltered. Other minerals with a lower resistance are seen to alter in this series to minerals such as serpentine, biotite and garnet.

== Distribution of deposits ==

Chromite is found as orthocumulate lenses in peridotite from the Earth&#x27;s mantle. It also occurs in layered, ultramafic intrusive rocks. In addition, it is found in metamorphic rocks such as some serpentinites. Ore deposits of chromite form as early magmatic differentiates. It is commonly associated with olivine, magnetite, serpentine and corundum. The vast Bushveld Igneous Complex of South Africa is a large layered mafic to ultramafic igneous body with some layers consisting of 90% chromite, forming the rare rock type chromitite (cf. chromite the mineral and chromitite, a rock containing chromite). The Stillwater Igneous Complex in Montana also contains significant chromite.

Chromite suitable for commercial mining is found in just a handful of very substantial deposits. There are 2 main types of chromite deposits: stratiform deposits and podiform deposits. Stratiform deposits in layered intrusions are the main source of chromite resources and are found in South Africa, Canada, Finland, and Madagascar. Chromite resources from podiform deposits are mainly found in Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Albania. Zimbabwe is the only country that contains notable chromite reserves in both stratiform and podiform deposits.

=== Stratiform deposits ===
Stratiform deposits are formed as large sheet-like bodies, usually formed in layered mafic to ultramafic igneous complexes. This type of deposit is used to obtain 98% of the worldwide chromite reserves.

Stratiform deposits are typically seen to be of Precambrian in age and are found in cratons. The mafic to ultramafic igneous provinces that these deposits are formed in were likely intruded into continental crust, which may have contained granites or gneisses. The shapes of these intrusions are described as tabular or funnel-shaped. The tabular intrusions were placed in the form of sills with the layering of these intrusions being parallel. Examples of these tabular intrusions can be seen in the Stillwater Igneous Complex and Bird River. The funnel-shaped intrusions are seen to be dipping towards the center of the intrusion. This gives the layers in this intrusion a syncline formation. Examples of this type of intrusion can be seen in the Bushveld Igneous Complex and the Great Dyke.

Chromite can be seen in stratiform deposits as multiple layers which consist of chromitite. Thicknesses for these layers range between 1 cm and 1 m. Lateral depths can reach lengths of 70 km. Chromitite is the main rock in these layers, with 50–95% of it being made of chromite and the rest being composed of olivine, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and the various alteration products of these minerals. An indication of water in the magma is determined by the presence of brown mica.

=== Podiform deposits ===
Podiform deposits are seen to occur within the ophiolite sequences. The stratigraphy of the ophiolite sequence is deep-ocean sediments, pillow lavas, sheeted dykes, gabbros and ultramafic tectonites.

These deposits are found in ultramafic rocks, most notably in tectonites. It can be seen that the abundance of podiform deposits increase towards the top of the tectonites.

Podiform deposits are irregular in shape. &quot;Pod&quot; is a term given by geologists to express the uncertain morphology of this deposit. This deposit shows foliation that is parallel to the foliation of the host rock. Podiform deposits are described as discordant, subconcordant and concordant. Chromite in podiform deposits form as anhedral grains. The ores seen in this type of deposit have nodular texture and are loosely-packed nodules with a size range of 5–20 mm. Other minerals that are seen in podiform deposits are olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, pargasite, Na-mica, albite, and jadeite.

== Health and environmental impacts ==
Chromium extracted from chromite is used on a large scale in many industries, including metallurgy, electroplating, paints, tanning, and paper production. Environmental contamination with hexavalent chromium is a major health and environmental concern. Chromium is most stable in its trivalent (Cr(III)) form, seen in stable compounds such as natural ores. Cr(III) is an essential nutrient, required for lipid and glucose metabolism in animals and humans. In contrast, the second most stable form, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), is generally produced through human activity and rarely seen in nature (as in crocoite), and is a highly toxic carcinogen that may kill animals and humans if ingested in large doses.

Health effects

When chromite ore is mined, it is aimed for the production of ferrochrome and produces a chromite concentrate of a high chromium to iron ratio. It can also be crushed and processed. Chromite concentrate, when combined with a reductant such as coal or coke and a high temperature furnace can produce ferrochrome. Ferrochrome is a type of ferroalloy that is an alloy in between chromium and iron. This ferroalloy, as well as chromite concentrate can introduce various health effects. Introducing a definitive control approach and distinct mitigation techniques can provide importance related to the safety of human health.

When chromite ore is exposed to surface conditions, weathering and oxidation can occur. The element chromium is most abundant in chromite in the form of trivalent (Cr-III). When chromite ore is exposed to aboveground conditions, Cr-III can be converted to Cr-VI, which is the hexavalent state of chromium. Cr-VI is produced from Cr-III by means of dry milling or grinding of the ore. This is due to the moistness of the milling process as well as the atmosphere in which the milling is taking place. A wet environment and a non-oxygenated atmosphere are ideal conditions to produce less Cr-VI, while the opposite is known to create more Cr-VI.

Production of ferrochrome is observed to emit pollutants into the air such as nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides and sulfur oxides, as well as dust particulates with a high concentration of heavy metals such as chromium, zinc, lead, nickel and cadmium. During high temperature smelting of chromite ore to produce Ferrochrome, Cr-III is converted to Cr-VI. As with chromite ore, Ferrochrome is milled and therefore produces Cr-VI. Cr-VI is therefore introduced into the dust when the Ferrochrome is produced. This introduces health risks such as inhalation potential and of toxins into the environment. Human exposure to chromium is ingestion, skin contact, and inhalation. Chromium-III and VI will accumulate in the tissues of humans and animals. The excretion of this type of chromium from the body tends to be very slow which means that elevated concentrations of chromium can be seen decades later in human tissues.

Environmental effects

Chromite mining, chromium, and ferrochrome production can toxically effect the environment. Chromite mining is necessary when it comes to the production of economic commodities.

As a result of leaching of soils and the explicit discharge from industrial activities, weathering of rocks that contain chromium will enter the water column. The route of chromium uptake in plants is still ambiguous, but because it is a nonessential element, chromium will not have a distinct mechanism for that uptake which is independent from chromium speciation. Plant studies have shown that toxic effects on plants from chromium include things such as wilting, narrow leaves, delayed or reduced growth, a decrease in chlorophyll production, damage to root membranes, small root systems, death and many more. Chromium&#x27;s structure is similar to other essential elements which means that it can impact the mineral nutrition of plants.

During industrial activities and production things such as sediment, water, soil, and air all become polluted and contaminated with chromium. Hexavalent chromium has negative impacts towards soil ecology because it decreases soil micro-organism presence, function, and diversity. Chromium concentrations in soil diversify depending on the different compositions of the sediments and rocks that the soil is made from. The chromium present in soil is a mixture of both Cr(VI) and Cr(III). Certain types of chromium such as Chromium-VI has the capability to pass into the cells of organisms. Dust particles from industry operations and industrial wastewater contaminate and pollute surface water, groundwater, and soils.

In aquatic environments, chromium could experience things such as dissolution, sorption, precipitation, oxidation, reduction, and desorption. In aquatic ecosystems chromium bioaccumulates in invertebrates, aquatic plants, fish, and algae. These toxic effects will operate differently because things such as sex, size, and the development stage of an organism may vary. Things such as the temperature of the water, its alkalinity, salinity, pH, and other contaminants will also impact these toxic effects on organisms.

== Applications ==
Chromite can be used as a refractory material because it has a high heat stability. The chromium extracted from chromite is used in chrome plating and alloying for production of corrosion resistant superalloys, nichrome, and stainless steel. Chromium is used as a pigment for glass, glazes, and paint, and as an oxidizing agent for tanning leather. It is also sometimes used as a gemstone. 

Usually known as chrome, it is a very essential industrial metal. It is hard and resistant to corrosion. This is used for things such as nonferrous alloys, the production of stainless steel, chemicals that process leather, and the creation of pigments. Stainless steel usually contains about 18 percent of chromium. The chromium in the stainless steel is the material which hardens making it resilient to corrosion.

Most shiny car trim is chromium plated. Superalloys that contain chromium allow jet engines to run under high stress, in a chemically oxidizing environment, and in high-temperature situations.

=== Porcelain tile pigmentation ===
Porcelain tiles are often produced with many different colours and pigmentations. The usual contributor to colour in fast-fired porcelain tiles is black pigment, which is fairly expensive and is synthetic. Natural chromite allows for an inexpensive and inorganic pigmentation alternative to the expensive and allows for the microstructure and mechanical properties of the tiles to not be substantially altered or modified when introduced.

<doc id="649267" wikidata="Q546425" url="?curid=649267" title="In the Air Tonight">
<text>&quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; is the debut solo single by English drummer and singer-songwriter Phil Collins. It was released as the lead single from Collins&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Face Value&quot;, in January 1981. It was selected as the second single from the album in the US and Canada after &quot;I Missed Again&quot;.

Collins co-produced &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; with Hugh Padgham, who became a frequent collaborator in the following years. It reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart behind the posthumous release of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Woman&quot;. It reached No. 1 in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Sweden, No. 2 in Canada, and the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand, and several other European territories. It reached No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States, and reached No. 2 on the Rock Tracks Chart, later certified gold by the RIAA, representing 500,000 copies sold. The song&#x27;s music video, directed by Stuart Orme, received heavy play on MTV when the new cable music video channel launched in August 1981.

&quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; remains one of Collins&#x27; best-known hits, often cited as his signature song, and is especially famous for its drum break towards the end, which has been described as &quot;the sleekest, most melodramatic drum break in history&quot; and one of the &quot;101 Greatest Drumming Moments&quot;. In 2006, the song was ranked at number 35 in VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 80s&quot;. In 2021, it was listed at No. 291 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==Background and recording==
===Inspiration===
Collins wrote the song amid the grief he felt after divorcing his first wife Andrea Bertorelli in 1980. In a 2016 interview, Collins said of the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;I wrote the lyrics spontaneously. I&#x27;m not quite sure what the song is about, but there&#x27;s a lot of anger, a lot of despair and a lot of frustration.&quot; In a 1997 BBC Radio 2 documentary, the singer revealed that the divorce contributed to his 1979 hiatus from the band Genesis, until they regrouped in October of that year to record the album &quot;Duke&quot;. Collins remembered playing the song to Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks but he felt it was too simple for the group.

===Musical style===

&quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; has been described as being &quot;at the vanguard of experimental pop&quot; in 1981 and &quot;a rock oddity classic&quot;, having been influenced by &quot;the unconventional studio predilections of Brian Eno and Peter Gabriel&quot;. It has also been described as a &quot;soft rock classic.&quot; Musically, the song consists of a series of ominous chords played on a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 over a simple drum machine pattern (the Roland CR-78 Disco-2 pattern, plus some programming); processed electric guitar sounds and vocoded vocals, an effect which is increased on key words to add additional atmosphere. The mood is one of restrained anger until the final chorus when an explosive burst of drums finally releases the musical tension and the instrumentation explodes into a thunderous crescendo. Composed in D minor, it has a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute.

Collins has described obtaining the drum machine specifically to deal with personal issues relating to his divorce through songwriting, telling &quot;Mix&quot; magazine: &quot;I had to start writing some of this music that was inside me&quot;. He improvised the lyrics during a songwriting session in the studio: &quot;I was just fooling around. I got these chords that I liked, so I turned the mic on and started singing. The lyrics you hear are what I wrote spontaneously. That frightens me a bit, but I&#x27;m quite proud of the fact that I sang 99.9 percent of those lyrics spontaneously&quot;.

===Drum sound===
The song is famous for its use of the gated reverb drum sound. Fellow musicians and journalists have commented on its use in the record. Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne called the drum fill &quot;the best ever – it still sounds awesome&quot;, while music critic and broadcaster Stuart Maconie was quoted:

The original single version of &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; features extra drums that play underneath the song until the signature drum crash (referred to by fans as the &quot;magic break&quot;) appears. These were added at the suggestion of Atlantic Records head Ahmet Ertegun. In 2007, Collins wrote:

==Release==
Speaking about the song&#x27;s rapid ascension in the music charts, Collins wrote the following in 2007:

==Critical reception==
&quot;Record World&quot; called the song &quot;futuristic pop that&#x27;s also rhythmically captivating.&quot;

==Urban legend==
An urban legend has arisen about &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, according to which the lyrics are based on a drowning incident in which someone who was close enough to save the victim did not help them, while Collins, who was too far away to help, looked on. Increasingly embellished variations on the legend emerged over time, with the stories often culminating in Collins singling out the guilty party while singing the song at a concert. Collins has denied all such stories; he commented on the legends about the song in a BBC World Service interview:

The urban legend is referenced in the song &quot;Stan&quot; by Eminem. The reference is contained in the following lyrics:

==Music video==
The music video (directed by Stuart Orme) animates the photograph of Collins&#x27;s face from the cover of the &quot;Face Value&quot; album, slowly fading in through the introduction until it fills the screen, singing the first chorus. The video then cuts to Collins sitting in an empty room at night. Twice a spectral figure appears in the window, but only the second time does Collins get up to look at it, then is shown walking to the one door of the room.

Collins&#x27;s face returns for the second chorus. He is then shown leaving the room and entering a hallway full of doors. The first one is locked, then the second opens and Collins sees himself looking at the window again, only now the spectre has turned into his own reflection.

The third door is locked, but as the fourth one opens, the drum break sounds and the viewer is returned to Collins&#x27;s face again, this time in thermal coloring, which gradually reverts to black and white. His reflection from the window is briefly superimposed on the face, this time seemingly reflected in water. Collins recedes into the darkness as the song repeats and fades.

In 1983 the music video was released on the home video &quot;Phil Collins&quot; available on VHS and LaserDisc which received a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form.

==Performance==
&quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; remains a popular selection on classic rock radio stations. It is the song most often associated with Collins&#x27; solo career, and he has performed it at many events, including Live Aid, where he played the song on a piano on the same calendar day in both Philadelphia and London. He also performed the song at &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;, which was his first live performance as a solo artist. &quot;I remember doing &#x27;In the Air Tonight&#x27; at Live Aid,&quot; he recalled, &quot;and [Pete] Townshend saying, &#x27;Are you going to do that fucking song again?&#x27; as if it was the only one I ever played.&quot;

==Legacy==
The song appeared as part of the soundtrack for the 1983 movie &quot;Risky Business&quot; and plays when the characters played by Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay have sex on a subway train.

In 1984, the song was memorably used in a scene from the first episode of the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, which film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited as why the song has been stamped as &quot;Property of Michael Mann&quot; (the series&#x27; executive producer) for years, rarely being used in other screen works due to its indelible use in the series, akin to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s signature use of songs by the Rolling Stones for his films. &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; received a new wave of attention thanks to its use in the series, enough for it to rise in sales outside the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 102.

The song was remixed in 1988 by Ben Liebrand for his weekly appearance in the Curry &amp; Van Inkel radio show on Dutch radio. The mix was completed and then taken by Liebrand to be part of a mix showcase at the DMC Mixing Championship Finals in London, attended by 3500 worldwide deejays. The mix was picked up by Virgin Records for an official release, which hit Number 4 in the UK charts.

David Wise, composer for the 1995 video game &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot;, has said that the track &quot;Bayou Boogie&quot; was inspired by &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, adding that he was &quot;trying to get the SNES to sound like the Roland CR78&quot; Collins used on the track.

The song gained notoriety again when it was used in a 2007 Cadbury&#x27;s Dairy Milk advert featuring a man in a gorilla suit warming up and playing the drum fill towards the end of the advert. Upon seeing the advert, Collins stated in a BBC interview that he thought the advert was &#x27;fantastic&#x27;. The song eventually reached number 14 in the UK Top 40 charts and appeared on the &#x27;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music 68&#x27; UK CD.

In July 2020, a video reaction to the song by TwinsthenewTrend increased the sales and streaming of Collins&#x27;s original version. The TwinsthenewTrend first-listen video was viewed 4.9 million times in its first two weeks online. Continued popularity brought new traffic to the Collins song which rose to number 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Digital Song Sales chart in August 2020.

On November 15, 2024, the song was used by Jake Paul as his entrance song in his boxing match against Mike Tyson, the first live event to be broadcast by Netflix.

<text>The Spider is an American pulp-magazine hero of the 1930s and 1940s. The character was created by publisher Harry Steeger and written by a variety of authors for 118 monthly issues of &quot;The Spider&quot; from 1933 to 1943. &quot;The Spider&quot; sold well during the 1930s, and copies are valued by modern pulp magazine collectors. Pulp magazine historian Ed Hulse has stated &quot;Today, hero-pulp fans value &quot;The Spider&quot; more than any single-character magazine except for &quot;The Shadow&quot; and &quot;Doc Savage&quot;.&quot;

==Creation and publication history==
The Spider was created in 1933 by Harry Steeger at Popular Publications as direct competition to Street and Smith Publications&#x27; vigilante hero the Shadow. Steeger said he got the idea for the character&#x27;s name when he was playing tennis and saw a large spider walking along the edge of the court. Steeger also sought to emulate the films of Douglas Fairbanks, while historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price felt the character was also descended from Siegfried, Fantômas and The Bat.

Recognizing that imitating the Shadow created the potential for lawsuits as well as the potential for strong sales, Streeger consulted his lawyer, who advised him to hire a writer with an established character and have him transform that character into the Spider. Thus, R.T.M. Scott&#x27;s detective character Aurelius Smith and Hindu assistant Langa Doone became, respectively, Richard Wentworth and Ram Singh. The first two novels were written by R.T.M. Scott, but they were deemed too slow-paced, so another author was brought in. Later stories were published under the house pen name of &quot;Grant Stockbridge&quot;, which was intended to recall Maxwell Grant, the house pen name which the Shadow novels were attributed to. Most of the Spider novels were actually written by Norvell Page. Other authors of the series included Donald C. Cormack, Wayne Rogers, Emile C. Tepperman, and Prentice Winchell. The series was the first Popular pulp to be named after a character rather than a genre.

The cover artists for &quot;The Spider&quot; magazine were Walter M. Baumhofer for the debut issue, followed by John Newton Howitt and Rafael De Soto. &quot;The Spider&quot; was published monthly and ran for 118 issues from 1933 to 1943. Sales declined in the late 1930s due to surging competition from superhero comics and (despite Spider novels making concessions to the popularity of superheroes, such as an increasing number of costumed villains) never fully recovered. Paper shortages during World War II and a declining readership following Page&#x27;s departure to work on propaganda also played their part.

A 119th Spider novel manuscript (&quot;Slaughter Incorporated&quot;) had been completed but was not published until decades later (as &quot;Blue Steel&quot;), a heavily rewritten mass-market paperback with renamed characters. In 2012, Moonstone Books finally published it as &quot;Slaughter, Inc.&quot;, in its original unedited form. The novel was again reprinted in 2018 by Altus Press as a facsimile edition, this time designed to look like a 1940s pulp.

==Stories==
The Spider stories often involve a bizarre menace to the country and a criminal conspiracy. They were often extremely violent, with the villains engaging in wanton slaughter of thousands as part of sometimes nationwide crime sprees. Pulp magazine historian Ed Hulse noted that &quot;&quot;Spider&quot; novel death tolls routinely ran into the thousands&quot;. The master criminal of the stories is usually unmasked only in the last few pages. The stories often end with Wentworth killing the villains and stamping their corpses&#x27; foreheads with his &quot;Spider&quot; mark. 

Will Murray would note the character&#x27;s brutality and willingness to kill criminals, even occasionally pre-emptively. Price and Turner also noted he was considerably more brutal and violent than other pulp heroes, especially under Page, who they stated &quot;maintained in the character a viciousness that placed &quot;The Spider&quot; magazine in a par with the horror-anthology pulps of its day&quot;.

A complete list of all 119 Spider pulps in the original series is available online at fan sites (see The Spider | List.)

==Characters==
===The Spider===
The Spider is millionaire playboy Richard Wentworth, who served as a major in World War I, and was living in New York City unaffected by the financial deprivations of the Great Depression. The ninth pulp represents him as the last surviving member of a rich family.
Wentworth is easily identified as the Spider by his enemies in a number of earlier novels and is arrested by the police, only to escape. He adopts a cover identity - Tito Caliepi - and associated aliases. The Spider&#x27;s earliest costume consisted of a simple black domino mask, black hat, and cape. Later in the series, vampire-like makeup appears, which is replaced with a face mask featuring grizzled hair and finally a hunchback. These are added to terrorize the criminal underworld, while the Spider dispenses his brand of violent vigilante justice. Utilizing his talent as a violinist, Wentworth (posing as Caliepi), sometimes uses busking as part of his disguise.

Wentworth also ventures into the underworld disguised as small-time hood Blinky McQuade in order to gain needed information. To Scotland Yard, Wentworth is known as Rupert Barton, who holds a badge of Inspector for services rendered; by the fifth novel, he also holds the rank of lieutenant in the FBI. Wentworth, according to the fifth story, is tall, and has grey eyes. He has an old battle scar on his head that flares up at times of great stress. He is an accomplished pianist and violinist, and drives a Lancia. He speaks fluent Hindustani and so talks with Ram Singh in his own language, with little fear anyone else would understand what is being said. As written by Page, Wentworth was also psychologically vulnerable and suffers frequent bouts of fear, self-doubt, despair and paranoia.

====The Spider&#x27;s seal and weapons====
The Spider&#x27;s calling card is a red-ink spider image (like a drop of blood) left on the foreheads of the criminals he kills, so others will not be blamed. In the sixth novel (1934), the Spider imprints his red sign on a gold ring so that any who need his help can use it by taking it to Kirkpatrick (where Wentworth will find out about it). The Spider&#x27;s seal was concealed in the base of his platinum cigarette lighter, and was invented by Professor Brownlee. The Spider also carried a thin silken line (his &quot;web&quot;) which had a tensile strength of several hundred pounds. Wentworth was also a master of disguise. In the small steel case of burglar tools he carried under his arm, he also had his make-up kit and (in the early novels) his Spider&#x27;s eye mask.

Like The Shadow, The Spider&#x27;s usual weapons of choice are a pair of Colt .45 caliber M1911 automatic pistols. He is a crack shot and normally shoots to kill. However, he would not shoot anyone in law enforcement, although they frequently are under orders to shoot to kill him on sight. Brownlee also invented the lethal and almost silent air pistol the Spider used for &quot;quiet&quot; kills. He acted as a sort of on-call weaponsmith for Wentworth, whom he looked upon as being close to a son. Wentworth also had a gun in one of his shoes, which he used twice in the 5th novel.

In Timothy Truman&#x27;s 1990s comic book adaptation, Brownlee created the &quot;Web-Lee&quot;, a non-lethal stun pistol that fired projectiles which erupted into a spider web-like mass, inundated with microscopic barbs of frozen curare.

====&quot;Master of Men&quot;====
The Spider&#x27;s by-name is &quot;Master of Men&quot;, indicating that he has a voice commanding enough to get many people to do his bidding. Wentworth can also imitate other people&#x27;s voices. When he imitates Kirkpatrick&#x27;s voice, he can give orders to lesser policemen during a stakeout, even during one intended to capture The Spider, so he can himself escape. Wentworth was not above disguising himself as a cop to escape when surrounded by policemen.

===Supporting characters===
*Nita Van Sloan is Wentworth&#x27;s longtime fiancée, who often aids him. Though they are as close as man and wife, they know they could never marry and have a family, as Wentworth believes he will eventually be unmasked or killed as The Spider, and his wife and family would then pay the price. In the issue #100 story, &quot;Death and The Spider&quot;, Wentworth expects to die. Nita disguises herself as The Spider a few times, covering for Wentworth when he has been seriously injured.
*Ram Singh, a Sikh (originally Hindu), is Wenthworth&#x27;s fanatically loyal manservant; he is a deadly knife thrower and usually carries several knives with him, including the deadly kukri. Ram Singh never views his position as a servant as demeaning or negatively impacting his self-respect, feeling that he serves a man totally above other men. At times, he and Wentworth talk in Hindustani, which only they understand.
*Sergeant Ronald Jackson, Wentworth&#x27;s chauffeur, served under Wentworth in World War I and often refers to him as &quot;the Major&quot;. He is killed by &quot;The Avenger&quot; in &quot;The Pain Emperor&quot; (Feb 1935). However he is revived in &quot;The Reign of the Death Fiddler&quot; (May 1, 1935) when it is revealed that Ram Singh saved him and brought him back to full health, ignoring the fact that Jackson had been given a military burial.
*Harold Jenkyns is Wentworth&#x27;s butler, an elderly man who has been in the Wentworth family&#x27;s service for a long time.
*Police Commissioner Stanley Kirkpatrick or simply &quot;Kirk&quot;, is Wentworth&#x27;s closest friend, who is sure Wentworth is The Spider but can never prove it. He has promised to arrest him, try him, and send him to the electric chair if he ever has proof.
*Professor Ezra Brownlee, an inventor and Wentworth&#x27;s old war colleague, features heavily in the early Spider novels; he is killed in &quot;Dragon Lord of the Underworld&quot; (July 1935). Brownlee&#x27;s son makes some appearances afterward, taking over from his late father. Brownlee&#x27;s unjust arrest is what motivated Wentworth to take the law into his own hands for the first time.

===Enemies===
Despite The Spider&#x27;s tendency to kill his enemies, he encounters several foes more than once, such as The Fly and MUNRO, a master of disguise, both of whom were killed at the conclusion of their first encounter with the Spider. Some storylines featuring a struggle against a single villain run for several consecutive issues, such as The Spider&#x27;s four-part battle against Tang-Akhmut, the Living Pharaoh (issues #36, 37, 38 and 39), and The Spider&#x27;s three-part battle against The Master and his Black Police (#60, 61 and 62), which was reprinted decades later in a single volume as &quot;The Spider vs The Empire State&quot;. Some enemies he encountered had names like the costumed super-villains of comic books, such as Judge Torture, Red Feather, The Bloody Serpent, The Brain, The Emperor of Vermin, The Red Mandarin, The Silencer, and The Wreck.

==Movie serials==
Columbia Pictures produced two Spider movie serials, both 15-chapter cliffhangers starring Warren Hull as Richard Wentworth. The first, &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; (1938), was also the first film serial to be made from a popular pulp magazine series character. In this serial The Spider battles The Octopus and his henchmen, who attempt to disrupt all commercial and passenger transportation systems, and later all U. S. industry. Spider pulp magazine novelist Norvell Page was one of the writers who worked on the serial&#x27;s screenplay. Compared to other light-hearted action-adventure serials, Price and Turner felt &quot;The Spider&quot; series owed more to film noir, noting &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; had a &quot;morbid desperation&quot; that bucked censorship standards. They ranked it as one of the best Columbia serials, and one of the few to truly do justice to its source material, noting the fast pace and high body count. The Octopus would feature in a short-lived Page-written pulp series for Popular that was rapidly reworked as &quot;The Scorpion&quot;.

In the second serial, &quot;The Spider Returns&quot; (1941), The Spider battles the mysterious crime lord The Gargoyle and his henchmen, who threaten the world with acts of sabotage and wholesale murder in an effort to wreck the U. S. national defense. Price and Turner bemoaned the sequel for abandoning the two-director system, calling it a &quot;wartime replay of &quot;Web&quot;&#x27;s story&quot;, also criticising the reduced role for Nita Van Sloane, now played by novice Mary Ainslee.

Both serials have The Spider&#x27;s black cape and head mask over-printed with a white spider&#x27;s web pattern and then matched with his usual plain black fedora. This addition gave the silver screen Spider an appearance more like that of a superhero, like other pulp and comics heroes being adapted for the era&#x27;s movie serials.

==Reprints==

Many, if not all, of the original 118 Spider pulp magazine novels have been reprinted over the years in both mass-market paperback and trade paperback editions or some other form. Very few attempts have been made, however, to publish the novels in chronological order, making it difficult for collectors to read them in the order in which they originally appeared.
Berkley Books (then Berkley/Medallion) first reprinted the Spider in 1969 and 1970, intending to reprint all 118 novels in order, hoping to tap into the reprint phenomenon of the Doc Savage novels being published by Bantam Books. However, these first paperback reissues met with poor sales. After reprinting only the first four volumes in the original pulp series, Berkley canceled the series. 
In the mid-1970s Pocket Books reprinted four Spider novels (originally published as pulps #16, 21, 26 and 100), featuring modernized pulp cover artwork by Robert A. Maguire. In this series, The Spider (renamed simply &quot;Spider&quot;) is portrayed as a non-costumed, heavily armed muscular blond-haired hero (similar to James Bond). These paperbacks also failed to sell, and the series was canceled. These four novels were re-edited and heavily modernized. In the reprint of &quot;Death and the Spider&quot; for example (originally published as pulp #100 in 1942), Nita Van Sloan drives a Jaguar E-type X-KE, a sports car not created until 1961, some 19 years later.

At roughly the same time in England, Mews Books/New American Library reprinted the same four Spider novels (#16, 21, 26 and 100) sporting entirely new cover art, but different in style and execution from those used by Pocket Books. Also called &quot;Spider&quot;, this character also resembled a non-costumed James Bond-type character (only with black hair instead of blonde). This British Spider mass market series also ended after the four titles were released. 
In 1979, Python Publishing published the never-before-seen last original Spider novel, &quot;Slaughter, Inc.&quot; (written by Donald G. Cormack), which was originally scheduled to have been published in 1944 as &quot;The Spider&quot; #119. Python published it as a one-shot mass market paperback. For copyright reasons, all of the characters&#x27; names were changed, the story was retitled &quot;Blue Steel: The Ultimate Answer To Evil&quot;, and the author was credited as &quot;Spider Page&quot; (a reference to the novel&#x27;s original author, Norvell Page). The Spider was recast in this book as a character named &quot;Blue Steel&quot;. As with Pocket Books&#x27; modernized &quot;Spider&quot; editions, this paperback sported a modernized pulp cover painting featuring a non-costumed, but heavily armed, blond-haired hero (said to be an unused cover painting by artist George Gross, produced but never used for a Freeway Press reprint of another pulp magazine character, Operator No. 5). In 2012, Moonstone Books finally published the 119th Spider novel &quot;Slaughter, Inc.&quot; in its original unedited form. The novel was reprinted yet again in 2018 by Altus Press as a &quot;facsimile edition&quot;, this time designed to look exactly how &quot;The Spider&quot; #119 pulp would have looked had it been published in 1944.
In 1980 Dimedia, Inc. (a.k.a. Pulp Press) reprinted three Spider pulp novels (#9, 10 and 11) in the larger trade paperback format. In 1984, they reprinted those same three novels as mass market paperbacks, sporting new cover paintings of the original costumed Spider by artists Ken Kelly (on volumes one and two) and Frank Kelly Freas (on volume three).
In the early 1990s Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers issued a series of eight mass market Spider paperbacks, each one reprinting two complete Spider novels. These 16 novels were the longest-running Spider reprint series done for the mass market paperback book market up to that time. The novels reprinted in this series were #14, 15, 17, 26, 30, 40, 41, 50, 52, 54, 75, 76, 78, 81, 92 and 113. All of them use the original &quot;The Spider&quot; pulp magazine artwork for their covers. (One cover was a newly done painting by Rafael DeSoto, the original pulp cover artist.)

After Carroll &amp; Graf, several specialized small press pulp reprint houses tried their hand at reprinting &quot;The Spider&quot; series. Bold Venture Press published ten issues of &quot;The Spider&quot; (#5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 26, 31, 50, 69 and 70). Wildside Press published two &quot;The Spider&quot; reprints (#78 and 92).

Pulp Adventure Press (PAP) reprinted 12 Spider novels in a magazine-sized format, even including the original interior artwork from the pulps (#12, 31, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 85).

&quot;Girasol Collectables&quot; (aka Adventure House) reissued the novels as a series of single pulp novel facsimile editions, as well as re-typeset stories in &quot;pulp double novel&quot; trade paperbacks. Both series use the original pulp magazine cover artwork for their books. Girasol published the first 23 issues of the original pulp series as &quot;facsimile&quot; editions. They also published 25 of their &quot;double-novel format&quot; issues, which total 50 novels reprinted in all (#1, 3, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 32, 34, 35, 42, 43, 49, 51, 53, 54, 55, 57, 59, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 77, 82, 83, 86, 87, 91, 95, 98, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 107, 108, 110, 112 and 114).
In 2007, New York science fiction publisher Baen Books published a trade paperback featuring three Spider novel reprints (#16, 74 and 85). In 2008, they released a second companion trade paperback featuring two more Spider reprints (#26 and 75) as well as a third bonus story about another pulp hero called &quot;The Octopus&quot;. In 2009, Baen re-issued both volumes as mass market paperbacks. The Baen editions sported brand new Spider cover paintings by noted graphic designer and comics artist Jim Steranko.

Also in 2007, Moonstone Books published an original anthology of brand new Spider short story pastiches entitled &quot;The Spider Chronicles&quot;. In 2013, Moonstone published a second anthology, &quot;The Spider: Extreme Prejudice&quot; featuring 12 more brand new Spider short story pastiches.

In late 2009, Doubleday&#x27;s Science Fiction Book Club reprinted (in hardcover) Baen&#x27;s second Spider three-in-one volume from the previous year. This became the first Spider hardcover edition ever to be published.

In August 2009, Age of Aces reprinted The Spider&#x27;s &quot;Black Police&quot; trilogy in a single volume which they titled &quot;The Spider vs. The Empire State&quot;. This trilogy consisted of three 1938 issues that were connected plotwise: #60 (September 1938), #61 (October 1938) and #62 (November 1938).

In October 2012, Moonstone Books published an original Spider pastiche novel, &quot;Shadow of Evil&quot;, by C. J. Henderson.

In 2013, Sanctum Books reprinted 20 Spider novels in ten &quot;double novel issues&quot;. Each book contained two reprinted novels. The pulps Sanctum reprinted were # 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16, 17, 18, 30, 31, 68, 74, 78, 90, 92, 93, 96, 106, 111 and 118.

The Vintage Library has 34 licensed Spider novel reprints in the PDF format. For a small fee, each one can be downloaded from their website.

Facsimile Spider novels continue to appear in print from other publishers, especially Altus Press; they have also been issued in the Kindle e-book format.

Altus Press has begun reprinting the entire Spider series of novels in their original order of publication beginning with #1, on a monthly basis. Altus also launched (in August 2018) a &quot;Wild Adventures of The Spider&quot; pastiche novel series. The first pastiche was written by Will Murray. &quot;The Doom Legion&quot; has Richard Wentworth team up with James Christopher (a.k.a. &quot;Operator No. 5&quot;) and &quot;G-8&quot;, two of Popular Publications&#x27; top pulp heroes. Two pastiche sequels, &quot;Fury in Steel&quot; and &quot;Scourge of the Scorpion&quot; by Will Murray, both came out in 2021.

==Comics and graphic novels==
===Eclipse Comics===
In December 1990 American comic publisher Eclipse Comics announced plans to produce a comic book series based on the character. Writer and artist Timothy Truman based the three-issue limited series on the 1934 story &quot;The Corpse Cargo&quot;, and the series was issued in the &#x27;prestige&#x27; square-bound format popularised by DC Comics&#x27; &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;; Enrique Alcatena contributed to the art. As noted in &quot;Comics Scene&quot; #19, Truman set his version of The Spider in the &quot;1990s as seen by the 1930s&quot;. Elements of this version of the Spider&#x27;s milieu include airships as common transportation, the survival of the League of Nations into the near past - Wentworth meets Ram Singh during an intervention into India and Pakistan - and World War II, if it ever happened, taking place differently. This series featured an African-American Commissioner Kirkpatrick. Truman chose to redesign the character, removing the hat and toning down the exaggerated monstrous look of Wentworth&#x27;s crime-fighting guise. He had originally planned to have the character wrap his face in bandages before becoming aware of Sam Raimi&#x27;s then-upcoming film &quot;Darkman&quot;. A long-time fan of the character, Truman had previous tried to get an adaptation made with First Comics early in his career.

Reviewing the title for &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, Fred Patten gave the first issue three stars out of five, bemoaning that the beloved character had been revised to &quot;another grim vigilante&quot;. However in the same magazine T. M. Maple, who had not previously heard of the character, found it much more pleasing, though he felt it was weaker that Truman&#x27;s best works. The series was a moderate sales success for Eclipse. and as a result they produced a three-issue follow-up &quot;The Spider: Reign of the Vampire King&quot; (based on &quot;Death Reign of the Vampire King&quot;) the following year. However, Eclipse would go out of business before any further material could be produced.

===Moonstone Books===
Between 2009 and 2011, Moonstone Books published several comics based on the original pulp character, including crossovers with fellow pulp heroes Domino Lady and Operator No. 5

===Dynamite Entertainment===
In August 2011, Dynamite Entertainment announced an updated Spider comic book series, written by novelist David Liss; the first issue was released in May 2012. The Spider&#x27;s costume in this series is based on the one worn by actor Warren Hull in Columbia&#x27;s 1940s Spider movie serials, but the black costume&#x27;s web lines are rendered in blood red instead of white. This comics series depicts The Spider and his allies fighting crime in a modern-day U. S. The 17-issue series received largely positive reviews.

In December 2012, Dynamite released the first issue of &quot;Masks&quot;, an eight-issue comic book miniseries that teams The Spider with Dynamite&#x27;s other pulp hero-based comic book characters, including the Green Hornet and Kato, The Shadow, and a 1930s descendant of Zorro. Together, they fight a powerful criminal syndicate which secretly controls New York City through the corrupt and powerful Justice Party, which has seized complete control over the city. This miniseries, set in the Depression Era of the 1930s, was not in the same continuity as Dynamite&#x27;s &quot;The Spider&quot; comic book series.

==Influence==
Notable fans of &quot;The Spider&quot; include Charles M. Schulz, who confessed that &quot;I could hardly stand to live from one month to another when the new Spider novel would come out.&quot; and Stan Lee, who named the character as a major influence on the creation of Spider-Man in the book &quot;Origins of Marvel Comics&quot;. Will Murray noted the similarity between the Spider&#x27;s costume in the movie serials and the original Spider-Man costume, and the common element of both characters being perpetually sought by authorities unaware of their true identities.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford, PC (1653 – 26 November 1727) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. After serving as a junior officer at the Battle of Solebay during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he served as a captain in the Mediterranean Sea in operations against the Barbary pirates.

Russell was one of the Immortal Seven, a group of English noblemen who issued the Invitation to William, a document asking Prince William of Orange to depose King James II. Based in the Netherlands, he served as Prince William&#x27;s secretary during the planning of William&#x27;s invasion of England and subsequent Glorious Revolution. He was fully engaged in providing naval support for the Williamite War in Ireland until the war ended. He was Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-Dutch force that fought the French fleet at the Battle of Barfleur and destroyed much of it in a night attack at the Battle of La Hogue during the Nine Years&#x27; War.

Russell went on to be First Lord of the Admiralty during the reign of William III and then held the office twice again in the reigns of Queen Anne and King George I. He was also MP for Launceston, for Portsmouth and then for Cambridgeshire.

==Early career==

Born the son of the Hon. Edward Russell, a younger son of the 4th Earl of Bedford and Penelope Russell (née Hill), daughter of Sir Moyses Hill of Hillsborough, County Down and widow of Sir William Brooke, Russell briefly attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and joined the Royal Navy in 1666. Promoted to lieutenant in 1671, he was appointed to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Advice&quot; and then transferred to the third-rate HMS &quot;Rupert&quot; and saw action, when a combined British and French fleet was surprised and attacked by the Dutch, led by Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, at the Battle of Solebay off the Suffolk coast in May 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

Promoted to captain on 10 June 1672, Russell was given command of the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Phoenix&quot; and then transferred to the command of the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Reserve&quot; in the Mediterranean, in operations against the Barbary pirates in February 1675, then to the command of the third-rate HMS &quot;Defiance&quot; in December 1677. He then moved to the third-rate HMS &quot;Swiftsure&quot; in March 1678 and then to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Newcastle&quot; in August 1680. In 1683 he ceased to be employed, as all of the members of the Russell family had fallen into disfavour with the King, after the discovery of Lord Russell&#x27;s connection with the Rye House Plot.

==Senior command==
Russell was one of the Immortal Seven, a group of English noblemen who issued the Invitation to William, a document asking William, Prince of Orange, to depose King James II in June 1688. Based in the Netherlands, he served as the prince&#x27;s secretary during the planning of William&#x27;s invasion of England and subsequent Glorious Revolution in November 1688.

Russell was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Launceston and appointed Treasurer of the Navy in 1689. Promoted directly to full admiral in May 1689, Russell took command in the Channel, with his flag in the second-rate HMS &quot;Duke&quot;, in 1689 and enforced a blockade of France. Russell lived at Chippenham Park in Cambridgeshire from 1689 until his death. He re-modelled the manor house and greatly extended Chippenham Park, which still dominates the parish to the south of the village.

Russell was elected Member of Parliament for Portsmouth in the general election in March 1690. He conveyed Maria Anna of Neuburg, Charles II of Spain&#x27;s future consort, from Flushing to Coruna in Spring 1690. He joined the Board of Admiralty led by the Earl of Pembroke, as Senior Naval Lord, in June 1690. Following the debacle at the Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690, Admiral the Earl of Torrington fell out of favour and Russell, having been promoted to Admiral of the Fleet, became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy in December 1690. He was fully engaged in providing naval support for the Williamite War in Ireland until the war ended in October 1691.

In the Autumn of 1690, Russell blamed the Dutch for the failure of the allies to enforce the blockade of France and was forced to stand down as a Lord Commissioner in January 1691. Flying his flag in the first-rate HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, he was Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-Dutch force that fought the French fleet at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692, during the Nine Years&#x27; War. At about 10 am the French Admiral the Comte de Tourville, with his flag in the French ship &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, attacked Russell&#x27;s flagship but around 1 pm, Tourville was forced to disengage with extensive damage to his rigging and sails. Russell then destroyed much of the French fleet, in a night attack at the Battle of La Hogue in June 1692.

Following a disagreement with the Earl of Nottingham, Russell resigned as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy in December 1692. Admirals Henry Killigrew, Ralph Delaval and Cloudesley Shovell were put in joint command of the fleet in January 1693. Following the disastrous attack on the Smyrna merchantmen at the Battle of Lagos in June 1693, all three admirals were dismissed from their joint command and Russell resumed command of the fleet in November 1693.

Russell became First Lord of the Admiralty and Senior Naval Lord in the First Whig Junto in May 1694 and took a fleet out into the Mediterranean in June 1694, becoming the first English naval commander to spend the Winter at Cádiz (rather than sailing his squadron home in the autumn). He was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire in 1695 and was created Baron Shingay, Viscount Barfleur and Earl of Orford on 7 May 1697. He faced allegations of having misappropriated funds from the maintenance of the fleet, to spend on his private estates in 1698. The accusations went no further and he left office as First Lord of the Admiralty, as Treasurer of the Navy and as Senior Naval Lord, when the First Whig Junto fell from power in May 1699. He commissioned the building of Orford House at Ugley in Essex in 1700.

Russell returned to office as First Lord in the coalition Godolphin–Marlborough ministry in November 1709 but left his post when the Tory-dominated Harley ministry came to power in October 1710. He was appointed for a third time as First Lord in the Whig Townshend ministry in October 1714 and having been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire on 27 September 1715, left his post again when that ministry left office in April 1717. He died at Covent Garden in London on 26 November 1727 and was buried in the Russell vault at St Michael&#x27;s Church in Chenies.

==Family==
In November 1691, Russell married his cousin, Lady Margaret Russell, youngest daughter of the 5th Earl of Bedford (later the 1st Duke of Bedford); they had no children. They lived from the time of their marriage until Russell&#x27;s death at 43 King Street, Covent Garden.

<text>William Taylor Barry (February 5, 1784 – August 30, 1835) was an American statesman, jurist and slave owner. He served as Postmaster General for most of the administration of President Andrew Jackson and was the only Cabinet member not to resign in 1831 as a result of the Petticoat affair.

==Life==
Born near Lunenburg, Virginia, he moved to Fayette County, Kentucky, in 1796 with his parents John Barry, an American Revolutionary War veteran, and Susannah (Dozier) Barry. His grandfather, Alexander Barry was born in Ribble Valley, Lancashire, England in 1721 and moved to America in 1744. He attended the common schools, Pisgah Academy and Kentucky Academy in Woodford County, Transylvania University at Lexington and graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary at Williamsburg, Virginia in 1803, after which studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1805. He commenced practice at Jessamine County, Kentucky and then at Lexington.

===Political life===
Elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1807, Barry became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1810 to 1811, then served in the War of 1812. From 1815 to 1816, he became a U.S. Senator from Kentucky, then won election to the Kentucky Senate and served from 1817 to 1821. During his time in the Kentucky Senate Barry wrote to former President James Madison seeking support for a plan of subsidizing public education across the state; Madison responded enthusiastically and included in his letter of August 4, 1822 the often-cited observation: &quot;A popular Government, without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both.&quot;

Meanwhile, Kentucky suffered from the Panic of 1819 and Barry became a leading figure in the debt relief party, which was successful in the elections between 1820 and 1824, although less successful when creditors challenged the relief laws in the courts. As a lawyer, Barry argued in support of those laws, which the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned in 1823. Barry also became the sixth Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky (1820 to 1824), then served as Secretary of State of Kentucky (1824 to 1825). He resigned that position to become Chief Judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals (the predecessor to the Kentucky Supreme Court) for the 1825 term during the Old Court - New Court controversy. Although the Old Court party won the 1826 elections, Barry ran for Governor of Kentucky in 1828.

Barry became U.S. Postmaster General in Andrew Jackson&#x27;s administration, serving from 1829 to 1835. While Postmaster General, he outlawed the mailing of William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s abolitionist newspaper, &quot;The Liberator.&quot;

He was the only member of Jackson&#x27;s original Cabinet not to resign as a result of the Petticoat Affair, which involved the social ostracism of Margaret O&#x27;Neill Eaton, the wife of Secretary of War John H. Eaton by a coalition of Cabinet members wives led by Second Lady Floride Calhoun. Barry, like Jackson, had sided with the Eatons.

===Appointments and awards===
He was appointed ambassador to Spain, but died before he could take office en route to his post, while stopped in Liverpool, England August 30, 1835. He was originally interred and a cenotaph still stands at St. James&#x27;s Cemetery, Liverpool, England; he was reinterred in 1854 at Frankfort Cemetery, Frankfort, Kentucky.

Barry County, Michigan, Barry County, Missouri, Barry, Missouri, Barrytown Barrytown, New York and Barryville, New York are named in his honor.

===Societies===
During the 1820s, Barry was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical, and other professions.

===Personal===
Barry was an uncle to Kentucky Governor Luke P. Blackburn.

<text>Interstate 696 (I-696) is an east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Metro Detroit region of the US state of Michigan. The state trunkline highway is also known as the Walter P. Reuther Freeway, named for the prominent auto industry union head by the Michigan Legislature in 1971. I-696 is a bypass route, detouring around the city of Detroit through the city&#x27;s northern suburbs in Oakland and Macomb counties. It starts by branching off I-96 and I-275 at its western terminus in Farmington Hills, and runs through suburbs including Southfield, Royal Oak and Warren before merging into I-94 at St. Clair Shores on the east end. It has eight lanes for most of its length and is approximately north of downtown Detroit. I-696 connects to other freeways such as I-75 (Chrysler Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway). Local residents sometimes refer to I-696 as &quot;The Autobahn of Detroit&quot;.

Planning for the freeway started in the 1950s. Michigan state officials proposed the designation I-98, but this was not approved. Construction started on the first segment in 1961, and the Lodge Freeway was designated Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696) the following year. The western third of the freeway opened in 1963, and the eastern third was completed in January 1979. The central segment was the subject of much controversy during the 1960s and 1970s. Various municipalities along this stretch argued over the routing of the freeway such that the governor locked several officials into a room overnight until they would agree to a routing. Later, various groups used federal environmental regulations to force changes to the freeway. The Orthodox Jewish community in Oak Park was concerned about pedestrian access across the freeway; I-696 was built with a set of parks on overpasses to accommodate their needs. The Detroit Zoo and the City of Detroit also fought components of the freeway design. These concessions delayed the completion of I-696 until December 15, 1989. Since completion, the speed limit was raised from . In addition, some interchanges were reconfigured in 2006.

==Route description==
I-696, which has been called &quot;Detroit&#x27;s Autobahn&quot; by some residents, reflecting a reputation for fast drivers, begins in the west in the city of Novi as a left exit branching off I-96. This ramp is a portion of the I-96/I-696/I-275/M-5 interchange that spans the north–south, Novi–Farmington Hills city line linking together five converging freeways. The freeway curves southeasterly and then northeasterly through the complex as it runs eastward through the adjacent residential subdivisions. I-696 passes south of 12 Mile Road in the Mile Road System through Farmington Hills, passing south of Harrison High School and north of Mercy High School. After crossing into Southfield, I-696 passes through the Mixing Bowl, another complex interchange that spans over near the American Center involving M-10 (Lodge Freeway and Northwestern Highway) and US Highway 24 (US 24, Telegraph Road) between two partial interchanges with Franklin Road on the west and Lahser Road on the east. The carriageways for I-696 run in the median of M-10 from northwest to southeast. East of this interchange, cargo restrictions have been enacted for the next segment of I-696; no commercial vehicles may carry flammable or explosive loads; the segment passes below grade and between retaining walls that are tall, which would hinder evacuation in the event of a fire. During construction in April 1989, vandals set a fire under one of the plazas, and officials were concerned about the intensity of the fire and the potential for a &quot;horizontal towering inferno&quot; along the freeway section once opened to traffic.
After passing through the Mixing Bowl, I-696 follows 11 Mile Road, which forms a pair of service drives for the main freeway. The Interstate passes through the city of Lathrup Village before turning southward and then easterly on an S-shaped path to run along 10 Mile Road. This segment of freeway is known for its extensive use of retaining walls; three large landscaped plazas form short tunnels for freeway traffic near the Greenfield Road exit. The freeway passes next to the Jewish Community Center of Metropolitan Detroit as it passes under the third pedestrian plaza. The Interstate then picks up 10 Mile Road, which forms a pair of service drives, as the Reuther runs along the border between the cities of Oak Park and Huntington Woods. I-696 follows the southern edge of the Detroit Zoo. Immediately east of the zoo, the Interstate intersects M-1 (Woodward Avenue), and crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger service between Detroit and Pontiac.
East of the rail crossing, I-696 has a four-level stack interchange with I-75 over the quadripoint for Royal Oak, Madison Heights, Hazel Park and Ferndale. This interchange marks the eastern end of the cargo restrictions. I-696 jogs to the northeast near the Hazel Park Raceway, leaving 10 Mile Road. Crossing into Warren in Macomb County at the Dequindre Road interchange, the freeway begins to follow 11 Mile Road again. Near the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant, I-696 has another stack interchange for Mound Road; through the junction, the freeway makes a slight bend to the south. The freeway continues east through the northern edge of Center Line, crossing a line of Conrail Shared Assets and heading back into Warren. The Interstate crosses into Roseville near the M-97 (Groesbeck Highway) interchange and then meets M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) just west of the eastern terminus at I-94 (the Edsel Ford Freeway) in St. Clair Shores. The service drives merge in this final interchange and 11 Mile Road continues due east to Lake St. Clair.

Like other state highways in Michigan, I-696 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department&#x27;s traffic surveys showed that on average 185,700 vehicles used the freeway daily east of I-75 and 38,100 vehicles did so each day in part of the Mixing Bowl, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-696 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

===Planning and initial construction===

I-696 is part of the original Interstate Highway System as outlined in 1956–58.
As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department, the freeway would have been numbered I-98. Construction started in 1961. The Lodge Freeway, the first segment of which opened in 1957, was given the Business Spur I-696 designation in 1962. The first segment of I-696 built was the western third of the completed freeway which opened in 1963–1964 at a cost of $16.6 million (equivalent to $ in ). This section ran from I-96 in Novi east to the Lodge Freeway in Southfield. The then-unfinished freeway was named for Walter P. Reuther, former leader of the United Auto Workers labor union after he and his wife died in a plane crash on May 9, 1970. The next year the Michigan Legislature approved the naming by passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 57.

In the late 1970s, during the second phase of construction, lobbying efforts and lawsuits attempted to block construction of the central section. If successful, the efforts would have left the freeway with a gap in the middle between the first (western) and second (eastern) phases of construction. During this time, MDOT assigned M-6 to the eastern section of the freeway under construction. Signs were erected along the service roads that followed 11 Mile Road to connect the already built stack interchange at I-75 east to I-94. By the time the eastern freeway segment was initially opened in January 1979 between I-94 and I-75, the signage for M-6 was removed and replaced with I-696 signage; it cost $200 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete. Later in 1979, a closure was scheduled to allow work to be completed on three of the segment&#x27;s nine interchanges.

===Controversies over middle segment===

The central section was the most controversial. Governor James Blanchard was 15 years old and a high school sophomore in neighboring Pleasant Ridge when the freeway was proposed and purchased a home in the area in 1972. He joked during remarks at the dedication in 1989, &quot;The unvarnished truth about this freeway? I wasn&#x27;t even alive when it was first proposed,&quot; and added, &quot;frankly, I never thought it would go through.&quot; Total cost at completion for the entire freeway at the end of the 30-year project was $675 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Arguments between local officials were so intense that during the 1960s, then-Governor George W. Romney once locked fighting bureaucrats in a community center until they would agree on a path for the freeway. During the 1970s, local groups used then-new environmental regulations to oppose the Interstate. The freeway was noted in a Congressional subcommittee report on the &quot;Major Interstate System Route Controversy in Urban Areas&quot; for the controversies in 1970. Before 1967, local communities had to approve highway locations and designs, and the debates over I-696 prompted the passage of an arbitration statute. That statute was challenged by Pleasant Ridge and Lathrup Village before being upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court. Lathrup Village later withdrew from a planning agreement in 1971; had that agreement been implemented, construction on the central section was scheduled to commence in 1974 and finish in 1976.
The community of Orthodox Jews in Oak Park wanted the freeway to pass to the north of their suburb. When this was deemed to be futile, the community asked for changes to the design that would mitigate the impact of the freeway to the pedestrian-dependent community. Final approval in 1981 of the freeway&#x27;s alignment was contingent on these mitigation measures. To address the community&#x27;s unique needs, the state hired a rabbi to serve as a consultant on the project. In addition, a series of landscaped plazas were incorporated into the design, forming the tunnels through which I-696 passes. These structures are a set of three bridges that cross the freeway within a mile (1.6 km). They allow members of the Jewish community to walk to synagogues on the Sabbath and other holidays when Jewish law prohibits driving. These plazas had their length limited; if they were longer, they would be considered tunnels that would require ventilation systems.

The Detroit Zoo was concerned that noise and air pollution from the Interstate would disturb the animals. They were satisfied by $12 million (equivalent to $ in ) spent on a new parking ramp and other improvements. The City of Detroit tried to stop I-696 as well, but in the end the city was forced to redesign its golf course. A refusal to grant an additional of right-of-way by Detroit forced additional design and construction delays during the 1980s.

One of the last obstacles to construction of the freeway was a wetlands area near Southfield. MDOT received a permit from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to destroy of wetland and create a replacement area. In the process, some prairie roses and wetlands milkweed were transplanted from the path of I-696 in 1987. The final section of the eight-lane freeway opened at a cost of $436 million (equivalent to $ in ) on December 15, 1989. At the time, one caller to a Detroit radio show commented, &quot;do you realize we have been to the moon and back in the time it has taken to get that road from Ferndale to Southfield?&quot;

===Since completion===
As part of the overall rehabilitation to the Mixing Bowl interchange, a new interchange at Franklin Road was to be constructed in 2006. An exit ramp from I-696 eastbound to American Drive opened in April 2006. An entrance ramp from Franklin Road to I-696 westbound opened in July 2006. The Franklin Road overpass, which had been closed during this time, re-opened in October 2006.

On November 9, 2006, the speed limit was increased from along the length of I-696. During speed enforcement patrols in August 2022, the Michigan State Police gave out 77 citations during one 4-hour period including six arrests. One motorist was driving at , while others were cited at .

==== Restore the Reuther ====
After many years of patch work and small repairs, it was clear that greater action was needed. As a result, MDOT started &quot;Restore the Reuther&quot; to repair the freeway in Oakland County and reconstruct the section between Dequindre Road and I-94 in Macomb County. This project also involved some pavement repairs and minor structure repairs on the section from I-275/M-5 to Dequindre. In 2019, reconstruction started on the section between Dequindre Road and I-94. This involved two phases. In phase 1, the westbound lanes were closed and detoured. In phase 2, the westbound lanes remained closed, but eastbound lanes were shifted on the westbound lanes. No entrance ramps were open, however there were limited exit ramps open. These ramps were Dequindre, Mound, and Groesbeck Highway. 

In 2023, MDOT started a complete reconstruction of I-696 from I-275 in Farmington Hills to US 24 (Telegraph Road) in Southfield. The eastbound lanes were reconstructed in 2023, and the westbound lanes were reconstructed the following year. During the reconstruction of the westbound lanes in 2024, I-696 had two lanes shifted onto the John C Lodge Freeway resulting in a temporary concurrency. This is the first time in the history of I-696 that a concurrency with the Lodge freeway had been in-place.

In 2025, MDOT began a two-year project to completely rebuild the middle section of I-696. It involves a complete and brutal two-year closure of the eastbound lanes starting from Exit 8 until the I-696/I-75 interchange. The westbound lanes would remain open with minor lane reductions. It was decided to close the eastbound lanes because the exit ramp to M-10 has two lanes of road capacity so it can more easily handle the load than if the westbound lanes were closed (as traffic would need to be routed onto the single lane ramp on the I-696/I-75 interchange).

During an open house in Oak Park, residents shared concerns about traffic cutting through local neighbors and asked why they couldn&#x27;t keep both directions of travel open like MDOT did with the project in Farmington Hills. MDOT said it would be difficult for emergency crews to get to the scene of an accident when one occurs if both sides of the freeway were to remain open. Brian Travis, an MDOT construction engineer, said &quot;It&#x27;s really a safety concern for us, this is the safest and most efficient way to build the project.&quot;

As part of the project, 60 bridges will be repaired, including the rebuilding of the Church Street Plaza bridge that contains Victoria Park. During that rebuilding, a walkway detour will be in place. The project will also include pavement upgrades and updates to 1,100 drainage structures, according to MDOT.

Once the eastbound lanes are reconstructed, westbound traffic will be shifted onto the eastbound lanes. It is unknown if any exit ramps during this shift will be open as the service drives in both directions are expected to remain open. The eastbound lanes are not expected to reopen until Fall 2026.

The closures were initially scheduled to begin on March 1st, but were rescheduled to March 3rd because of the weather.

In 2027, MDOT planes to finish the project by reconstructing I-696 from the I-75 interchange to Dequindre Road. The project will then be completed.

<text>The N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov Saint Petersburg State Conservatory () (formerly known as the Petrograd Conservatory and Leningrad Conservatory) is a school of music in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 2004, the conservatory had around 275 faculty members and 1,400 students.

==History==

The conservatory was founded in 1862 by the Russian Music Society and Anton Rubinstein, a Russian pianist and composer. On his resignation in 1867, he was succeeded by Nikolai Zaremba. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov was appointed as a professor in 1871, and the conservatory has borne his name since 1944, the centenary of his birth. In 1887, Rubinstein returned to the conservatory with the goal of improving overall standards. He revised the curriculum, expelled inferior students, fired and demoted many professors, and made entrance and examination requirements more stringent. In 1891, he resigned again over the Imperial demand of racial quotas.

The current building was erected in the 1890s on the site of the old Bolshoi Theatre of Saint Petersburg. As the city changed its name in the 20th century, the conservatory was renamed Petrograd Conservatory (Петроградская консерватория) and Leningrad Conservatory (Ленинградская консерватория).

School alumni have included such composers as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Artur Kapp, Rudolf Tobias, and Dmitri Shostakovich, who taught at the conservatory during the 1960s. Amongst his pupils were German Okunev and Boris Tishchenko. Composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov taught at the conservatory for almost forty years, and his bronze monument is located outside the building in Theatre Square. The youngest musician ever admitted to the conservatory was four-year-old violinist Clara Rockmore, who later became one of the world&#x27;s foremost theremin players.
