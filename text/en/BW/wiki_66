<text>Mark LoMonaco (born July 14, 1971), known by his ring name Bubba Ray Dudley (also spelled Buh-Buh Ray Dudley), is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE under a legends contract. He is best known for being one-half of the Dudley Boyz tag team (also known as Team 3D) with D-Von Dudley, during his tenures in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and WWE.

Debuting in 1991, LoMonaco came to prominence when he joined ECW as a member of the Dudley Brothers in 1995, going by the ring name Bubba Ray Dudley. He formed a tag team with Devon Hughes (known as D-Von Dudley) called the Dudley Boyz, who became eight-time ECW World Tag Team Champions. In 1999, they moved to the WWF (now WWE) and became eight-time World Tag Team Champions, as well as one-time WWE Tag Team Champions and WCW World Tag Team Champions. An accomplished tag team wrestler, LoMonaco is considered one-half of one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era. He also held the WWE Hardcore Championship eight times before leaving in 2005. Alongside Hughes, LoMonaco joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) later that year, changed their team name to Team 3D, in addition to changing his ring name to Brother Ray, and became one-time NWA World Tag Team Champions and two-time TNA World Tag Team Champions. After the team disbanded in 2010, LoMonaco competed as a singles wrestler under the name Bully Ray and went on to hold the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice. He left TNA in 2015, and returned to WWE with Hughes as The Dudley Boyz for two years, before joining Ring of Honor (ROH), until 2020. He then worked for National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), returned to TNA (known at the time as Impact Wrestling), before making a second return to WWE, where he appears as a coach for &quot;WWE LFG&quot;.

In addition to twenty three tag team championships won between ECW, WWE, TNA and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), LoMonaco has won thirty six titles between ECW, WWE, TNA and NJPW factoring in the aforementioned tag team championships, eight WWE Hardcore Championships, two TNA World Championships, and one ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship (held with the Briscoe Brothers). LoMonaco was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2014 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018 as part of Team 3D and The Dudley Boyz respectively.

==Early life==
Mark LoMonaco was born in the Queens borough of New York City on July 14, 1971. He moved to Dix Hills, New York, in his youth and graduated from Half Hollow Hills East High School, where he was a member of the track and football team.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1991–1995) ===
LoMonaco trained under Johnny Rodz, and debuted in 1991. He used the ring name Mongo Vyle with the gimmick of a biker billed from Hell&#x27;s Kitchen who was inspired by The Nasty Boys, The Road Warriors, and Maxx Payne.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995–1999) ===

LoMonaco received a tryout with Extreme Championship Wrestling in September 1995, appearing as Mongo, the bodyguard of Bill Alfonso. After impressing ECW owner Paul Heyman by taking a chokeslam from wrestler 911, LoMonaco was hired. He was recast as Buh Buh Ray Dudley, the stuttering, dancing, overweight, hillbilly member of the sprawling Dudley family. The unusual spelling of &quot;Bubba&quot; was a result of his stutter. In saying his name, Buh-Buh would stutter, causing him to say &quot;my name is Buh-buh-buh-buh&quot; until Big Dick Dudley struck him in the chest, at which point he would shout &quot;my name is Bubba Ray Dudley&quot;. The fans embraced the comical Dudley boys and during Buh Buh&#x27;s matches would chant &quot;Buh Buh Buh Buh&quot;. The spelling eventually stuck.

On April 13, 1996, at Massacre on Queens Boulevard, D-Von Dudley debuted in ECW and began feuding with the other members of the Dudley Family (his kayfabe half-brothers), claiming that their comedic antics were not the way true Dudleys should act. D-Von eliminated Dances With Dudley, Dudley Dudley, and Chubby Dudley before joining forces with Buh Buh Ray, Big Dick, Sign Guy Dudley, and Joel Gertner. Known collectively as the Dudley Boyz, Buh Buh Ray and D-Von dominated the ECW tag team division, winning the ECW World Tag Team Championship a record eight times and defeating the four major tag teams in ECW: The Public Enemy, The Eliminators, The Gangstas, and Sabu and Rob Van Dam. Buh Buh Ray, D-Von, and Gertner all achieved a degree of infamy for their vitriolic interviews, which antagonized audiences to a point of near riot.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1999–2005)===

====The Dudley Boyz (1999–2002)====

In 1999, Buh Buh Ray and D-Von left ECW and joined the World Wrestling Federation, where the &quot;Buh Buh&quot; stutter-spelling of &quot;Bubba Ray Dudley&quot; was rescinded. Throughout 2000 and 2001, the Dudley Boyz engaged in a three-way feud for the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Hardy Boyz and Edge &amp; Christian. The feud incorporated one Ladder Match and two critically acclaimed Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches, the Ladder at WrestleMania 2000, and the TLC matches at SummerSlam (2000), and WrestleMania X-Seven. While they were initially heels, one of the things Bubba Ray was known for was driving women through tables including WWE Divas Terri, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, Tori, Torrie Wilson, Stacy Keibler and Jazz. The Dudley Boyz were soon cheered by the crowd and were turned face in early 2000. On the December 28, 2000 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Bubba Ray received a title shot against WWF Champion Kurt Angle, which he lost. In early 2001, The Dudleys were joined in the WWF by Spike Dudley.

In mid-2001, the Dudley Boyz turned heel once again by joining The Alliance, a large stable of former ECW and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestlers led by Shane McMahon and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley who attempted to take over the WWF (Spike, along with other ECW alumni, did not join The Alliance). The ECW-WCW invasion ended at the Survivor Series, when five WWF wrestlers defeated five Alliance wrestlers in a match to determine the ownership of the WWF. The Alliance disbanded and its members left the WWF, but the Dudley Boyz retained their jobs due to their possession of the WWF Tag Team Championship, which they had unified with the WCW Tag Team Championship that night.

====Hardcore Champion and Dudley Boyz reunion (2002–2005)====

Following WrestleMania X8, the WWF was renamed &quot;World Wrestling Entertainment&quot; (WWE) in May 2002 and the roster was divided into two brands: Raw and SmackDown!. The Dudley Boyz were separated when Bubba Ray was drafted to the Raw brand and D-Von was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. On &quot;Raw&quot;, Bubba Ray found moderate success as he competed for the WWE Hardcore Championship, formed a tag team with Spike, and even competed in a World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H. D-Von&#x27;s new gimmick on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; failed to get over, however, and he was reunited with Bubba Ray and Spike at Survivor Series on November 17, when he moved to the Raw brand to help Bubba Ray and Spike defeat Rico and 3-Minute Warning (Rosey and Jamal) in a Six Man elimination tables match.

The Dudley Boyz became a force to be reckoned with in the Raw tag team division over the next sixteen months, feuding with teams such as 3-Minute Warning, La Résistance, and various combinations of The Un-Americans. They held the World Tag Team Championship several more times before being traded (along with Booker T) to the SmackDown! brand on March 22, 2004, in exchange for Triple H. Shortly after arriving on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the Dudley Boyz turned heel once again, siding with Paul Heyman and feuding with Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio. On the May 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the Dudley Boyz kidnapped Paul Bearer, the manager of Heyman&#x27;s enemy The Undertaker. On June 27 at The Great American Bash, The Undertaker defeated the Dudley Boyz in a handicap match. In July, the Dudley Boyz reunited with Spike. For the remainder of the year, they assisted Spike in his matches for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. They also won the WWE Tag Team Championship one more time. In early 2005, the Dudley Boyz were removed from WWE television and sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling while the WWE creative team attempted to devise an angle for them.

The Dudley Boyz returned to WWE television in June 2005 in order to promote ECW One Night Stand, an ECW reunion show. In the weeks preceding ECW One Night Stand they, along with several other ECW alumni, vied with General Manager Eric Bischoff and his &quot;anti-hardcore crusaders&quot;. At ECW One Night Stand on June 12, the Dudley Boyz defeated Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in the main event of the night after driving Dreamer through a flaming table. On July 5, 2005, WWE announced that it had opted not to continue contract renewal negotiations with the Dudley Boyz. In addition, fifteen other wrestlers were released by WWE, which was decreasing its spending as a result of a fall in projected revenue. In August 2005, all three former Dudleys were issued with legal notices instructing them not to use the (WWE trademarked) name &quot;Dudley&quot;. This led to a degree of acrimony between the former Dudleys and their erstwhile employers, as they had used the names since 1996, several years before all ECW intellectual property was acquired by WWE as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. Soon after, LoMonaco and Hughes (D-Von) announced that they intended to pursue legal action against WWE.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2014; 2015)===

==== Team 3D (2005–2010) ====
No longer able to use the Bubba Ray Dudley name, LoMonaco adopted (and trademarked) the ring name Brother Ray Deadly, while Hughes became Brother Devon Deadly. The team also trademarked the terms &quot;Deadly Brothers&quot; and &quot;Deadly Death Drop&quot;. In August and September 2005, Ray and Devon made several appearances on the independent circuit, most notably Hardcore Homecoming, an unofficial ECW reunion show organized by ECW alumnus Shane Douglas, a frequent critic of WWE and Chairman Vince McMahon. On September 21, 2005, it was announced that they had signed multi-year contracts with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Ray and Devon debuted in TNA on the October 1, 2005 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; – the first episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; to be aired on Spike TV and in a prime time slot. They were identified as &quot;Brother Ray&quot; and &quot;Brother Devon&quot; respectively (with the suffix &quot;Deadly&quot; apparently having been dropped) and as Team 3D collectively. Team 3D quickly established themselves as faces by confronting the heel NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett and his allies, the NWA World Tag Team Champions, America&#x27;s Most Wanted (AMW). Team 3D defeated AMW at pay-per-view events in November and December 2005, but failed to defeat them in a title match at Final Resolution on January 15, 2006, due to the interference of Team Canada. Ray and Devon continued to feud with America&#x27;s Most Wanted and Team Canada over the following months. On the April 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, an attempted ambush by Team Canada was foiled by the debuting Spike Dudley, identified as &quot;Brother Runt&quot;. They had many battles with The Latin American Xchange (LAX) until winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship from LAX at Lockdown in an &quot;electrified&quot; steel cage match.

Upon the disintegration of TNA&#x27;s contract with the NWA, Ray and D-Von were stripped of the NWA Tag Team Championships and awarded the TNA World Tag Team Championship as compensation. They defended these belts against the team of Road Warrior Animal and Rick Steiner at Slammiversary. Following a match on &quot;Impact!&quot; to determine opponents, Ray would headline Victory Road alongside his partner in a match of champions encounter against TNA World Champion Kurt Angle and X Division Champion Samoa Joe. At Victory Road, Ray and D-Von lost their match, and the TNA tag titles, to Angle and Joe, though only Joe gained complete control of the titles as he scored the pinfall and could select a partner of his choosing.

The next feud had Team 3D along with the X-Division traitor Johnny Devine against Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and the entire TNA X Division. Team 3D and Devine lost at Against All Odds 2008 meaning that they have to be under two-hundred seventy-five pounds in order to compete in the X Division. However, the angle was dropped. Brother Ray and Devon aligned themselves with Angle during his feud with A.J. Styles. This led to them feuding with Christian Cage and Rhino as well. At Hard Justice, they lost to Cage and Rhino in a New Jersey Street Fight. They then feuded with Matt Morgan and Abyss, losing to them at No Surrender. At Bound for Glory IV, they participated in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match for the Tag Team Championship, but came up short. Team 3D appeared to join Main Event Mafia but turned face by double crossing the stable and jumping them along with TNA Front Line leaders Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles, and Rhino. They also attempted to put former ally Kurt Angle through a table.

At Lockdown Team 3D won the TNA World Tag Team Championship and retained the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm). At Slammiversary they lost the TNA tag titles to Beer Money, Inc. and on the July 30 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the IWGP tag titles to The British Invasion of Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams. On October 18, 2009, at Bound for Glory, Team 3D captured their 23rd tag team championship when they defeated Beer Money, British Invasion, and The Main Event Mafia&#x27;s Scott Steiner and Booker T in a Full Metal Mayhem Tag Team match.
With both the IWGP and TNA Tag tiles on the line, they captured the IWGP titles which were formerly held by The British Invasion. During the following weeks Team 3D turned heel and aligned themselves with Rhino in a battle against the younger talent of the company. On the November 19 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Team 3D Academy of Professional Wrestling and Sports Entertainment graduate Jesse Neal joined Team 3D and Rhino, and two weeks later Suicide joined Morgan, Hernandez and Dinero to level the playing field. At Final Resolution Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. On January 4, 2010, at Wrestle Kingdom IV, Team 3D lost the IWGP Tag Team Title to No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro) in a three-way hardcore match, which also included Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson). When Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff took over TNA at the beginning of 2010, Team 3D&#x27;s angle with Rhino and Neal was discontinued and they reverted to being faces, while starting a feud with The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags), who were a part of the new wave of wrestlers brought in by Hogan and Bischoff. At Against All Odds, The Nasty Boys defeated Team 3D in a tag team match, when Jimmy Hart made his return to the company and interfered in the match on the Nasty Boys&#x27; behalf.

Team 3D avenged their loss on the February 25 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when Neal helped them defeat the Nasty Boys in a tables match. On the March 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Team 3D and Neal were scheduled to face the Nasty Boys and Hart in a six-man tag team match, but prior to the match the Nasty Boys attacked Neal backstage and put him through a table. Team 3D found Neal a replacement in the returning Brother Runt, but were still defeated in the match by the Nastys and Hart. However, after the match Neal made the save for Team 3D and helped them put Sags through a table. On May 16 at Sacrifice, Ray turned heel by attacking Neal and costing him and Shannon Moore their match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, after feeling he had been disrespected by Neal. The following month at Slammiversary VIII, Neal defeated Ray in a singles match after a distraction from the debuting Tommy Dreamer. The following month at Victory Road, Ray faced Neal and Devon in a three-way match. During the match, the members of Team 3D attacked each other, before Neal accidentally speared Devon and was then pinned by Ray. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Devon joined fellow ECW alumni Mick Foley, Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Pat Kenney and Al Snow and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam in attacking Brother Ray, Abyss and the rest of the TNA locker room. The following week, Ray declined Devon&#x27;s offer to join the ECW alumni, before TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give them their own reunion pay-per-view event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company. However, on the July 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Ray decided to join the ECW alumni and seemingly buried the hatchet with his brother, becoming a face again in the process. On August 8 at Hardcore Justice, Team 3D, accompanied by Joel Gertner, defeated Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney, billed as Kahoneys, in a South Philadelphia Street Fight. After the match Ray and Devon were assaulted by the Gangstas. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni, known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they did not deserve to be in TNA. This would mark Team 3D&#x27;s final appearance on their old TNA contracts, which expired shortly thereafter. The two then entered negotiations over new contracts. Team 3D returned to TNA television two month later on the October 7 live episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, promising a major announcement at Bound for Glory. At the pay-per-view Team 3D announced their retirement, but asked for a one final match against the TNA World Tag Team Champions, the Motor City Machine Guns. Their new multi-year contracts with TNA were confirmed shortly thereafter. At Turning Point, the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Team 3D to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.

==== Immortal (2010–2012) ====
During Team 3D&#x27;s retirement ceremony on the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Ray turned heel by attacking Devon, reigniting the feud between the two. The following week Ray claimed that Devon had gotten weak, since Chris Sabin had managed to kick out of a &quot;3D&quot; (Dudley Death Drop) at Turning Point, calling him the Marty Jannetty and himself the Shawn Michaels of the team. On the December 16 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, LoMonaco renamed himself Bully Ray, as he defeated Amazing Red in a squash match. On January 9, 2011, at Genesis, Ray defeated Devon via disqualification, after Devon hit his former partner with his own chain. In the following weeks, Devon&#x27;s sons Terrence and Terrell began making appearances on &quot;Impact!&quot;, and were regularly abused by Ray. At Against All Odds Ray faced his former tag team partner in a Street Fight. After Devon&#x27;s sons interfered in the match, Ray low-blowed him and pinned one of his sons for the win. On March 13 at Victory Road, Devon and his sons interfered in a Falls Count Anywhere match between Ray and Tommy Dreamer, costing Ray the match. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Ray&#x27;s feud with Devon was abruptly ended as he aligned himself with Immortal and moved on to feuding with Fortune. At the show&#x27;s end, Ray powerbombed A.J. Styles off the entrance stage through a table, sidelining him with a storyline injury. On April 17 at Lockdown, Immortal, represented by Ray, Abyss, Matt Hardy and Ric Flair, was defeated by Fortune members James Storm, Kazarian and Robert Roode and Christopher Daniels, who replaced Styles, in a Lethal Lockdown match. During the match, Styles made his return, attacking Ray as he was beating Daniels. On the April 28 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Ray challenged Sting for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated following interference from Styles. Ray then recruited Dreamer as his partner and helped him defeat Styles at Sacrifice. On the May 26 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles and Daniels defeated Ray and Dreamer in a No Disqualification Street Fight. On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Ray defeated Styles in a Last Man Standing match to win the feud. After the match Ray, though still retaining his status as a heel, put over Styles&#x27; resilience.

On the July 28 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray began having problems with fellow Immortal member Mr. Anderson, when he cost him his steel cage match against Kurt Angle. The tension between the two stablemates eventually led to a match on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, where Ray defeated Anderson with a low blow. From June to September, Ray was one of the twelve participants in the Bound for Glory Series to determine the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. When the group stage of the tournament concluded, Ray finished in the top four and thus advanced to the finals at No Surrender along with James Storm, Robert Roode and his Immortal stablemate, Gunner. On September 11 at No Surrender, Ray defeated Storm via disqualification, moving him up to 52 points. However, later in the event Roode managed to defeat Gunner via submission, which meant that he tied Ray&#x27;s score to set up a tiebreaker match between the two. In the tiebreaker match, Ray was defeated by Roode via pinfall. On October 16 at Bound for Glory, Ray was defeated by former Immortal stablemate Mr. Anderson in a Falls Count Anywhere match. On November 13 at Turning Point, Ray and Scott Steiner were defeated by Anderson and Abyss in a tag team match. On January 8, 2012, at Genesis, Ray was defeated by Abyss in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match. Ray later aligned himself with Bobby Roode, interfering in his matches especially ones relating to Roode&#x27;s title. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Ray was unable to capture the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Roode in a four-way match, which also included James Storm and Jeff Hardy. On the February 16 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray was defeated by James Storm in a number one contender&#x27;s match. On March 18 at Victory Road, Ray was defeated by Storm in a rematch to retain his spot as the number one contender. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray started a rivalry with X Division Champion Austin Aries, after interrupting an X Division Championship match between Aries, Anthony Nese, Kid Kash and Zema Ion. The rivalry between Ray and Aries continued on April 15 at Lockdown, where the two were on opposing teams in the annual Lethal Lockdown match. On the April 12, 2012 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Ray with Eric Bischoff, Flair, Kazarian, Daniels and Gunner defeated Styles with Garett Bischoff, Aries and Mr. Anderson. Aries&#x27; team, led by Garett Bischoff, ended up defeating Ray&#x27;s team, led by Eric Bischoff. On May 13 at Sacrifice, Ray was defeated by Aries in a singles match. Afterwards, Ray returned to his rivalry with Abyss, when his supposed brother Joseph Park accused him of Abyss&#x27; disappearance. On June 10 at Slammiversary, Park defeated Ray in an Anything Goes match, following interference from Abyss. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray entered the 2012 Bound for Glory Series, taking part in the opening gauntlet match, from which he was eliminated by an interfering Abyss. Ray and Park had a rematch on the July 12 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; in an Anything Goes match, which Ray won after hitting his opponent with a chain. After the match, Park attacked Ray and hit him with Abyss&#x27; signature &quot;Black Hole Slam&quot;.

==== Aces &amp; Eights (2012–2013) ====
In August, Ray came together with the rest of the TNA locker room to battle the villainous Aces &amp; Eights stable, who had been attacking random TNA wrestlers during the past months, in the process making a gradual face turn. In September, Ray, unlike his longtime tag team partner Devon, signed a two-year contract extension with TNA. On the September 6 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray finished his Bound for Glory Series group stage with a win over Rob Van Dam, thus finishing third and advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. On September 9 at No Surrender, Ray defeated James Storm in his semifinal match, following interference from Bobby Roode, before losing to Jeff Hardy in the finals of the 2012 Bound for Glory Series, despite Hardy being attacked by the Aces &amp; Eights before the match. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray was granted another opportunity to become the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was again defeated by Hardy. On the September 20 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray defeated World Heavyweight Champion Austin Aries in a non-title match, after hitting him with a steel chain. On the October 4 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray defeated both Aries and his number one contender Jeff Hardy in a three-way match, after which Hulk Hogan agreed to let him become Sting&#x27;s partner for the match against the Aces &amp; Eights stable at Bound for Glory. On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Ray and Sting were defeated by the Aces &amp; Eights, who in the process earned full access to TNA. Afterwards, the returning Devon was revealed as one of the members of the Aces &amp; Eights. On November 1, Ray and Devon faced off in the main event of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, however, the match ended in a brawl between the Aces &amp; Eights and the TNA locker room.

Over the next few weeks, tension would be teased between Ray and Hulk Hogan after Austin Aries revealed a secret relationship between Ray and the general manager&#x27;s daughter Brooke. On December 9 at Final Resolution, Ray was defeated by Austin Aries in a singles match, following a distraction from both Brooke and Hulk Hogan and a low blow from Aries. On the January 3, 2013 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hogan suspended both Ray and Brooke after seeing them kissing in the parking garage two weeks before. The following week, Ray proposed to Brooke after saving her from the Aces &amp; Eights, which she accepted. The ceremony took place the next week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where Ray&#x27;s groomsman Taz interrupted and revealed himself a member of Aces &amp; Eights, leading to the group attacking Ray, Hulk Hogan, and the rest of the groomsmen. On the January 31 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hogan reinstated Ray and pitted him and Sting against Aces &amp; Eights (Devon and DOC) in a Tables match the following week, where Ray won the match by putting Devon through a table.
On the February 21 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hogan named Ray the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Ray received his shot in a steel cage match on March 10 at Lockdown, where he defeated Jeff Hardy, following interference from Aces &amp; Eights, to win his first World Heavyweight Championship. Afterwards, Ray revealed himself as the president of Aces &amp; Eights, turning heel again in the process, and reuniting with Devon. Ray made his first televised title defense on the April 11 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, defeating Jeff Hardy in a Full Metal Mayhem match to retain his title. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Ray successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Sting in a No Holds Barred Match after an interference by Aces &amp; Eights, with the added stipulation, that Sting would never get another World title opportunity again. Following Slammiversary, Ray and Aces &amp; Eights would continue feuding with Sting and his New Main Event Mafia (Kurt Angle, Magnus, Samoa Joe, and Rampage Jackson). On July 18, during the Destination X episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Chris Sabin, ending his reign at 130 days. Ray received his rematch in a steel cage on August 15 at Impact Wrestling: Hardcore Justice, where he defeated Sabin, following interference from Mr. Anderson and Tito Ortiz, to regain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the August 22 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray revealed his marriage with Brooke Hogan fell apart as he broke up with her, and announced his relationship with Brooke Tessmacher. Later that night, Devon was forced to leave TNA after being pinned by A.J. Styles in a five-on-five tag team match against the Main Event Mafia. The following week, tension began to be teased between Bully Ray and Aces &amp; Eights Vice-president Mr. Anderson, with Anderson disagreeing with Ray claiming he never needed Devon and bring Tito Ortiz into the stable without a group vote. During Ray&#x27;s match with Sting on the September 5 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Anderson cost Ray by refusing to help him. Afterwards, Anderson attacked Ray and announced that he would be his challenger at No Surrender. The following week, Ray successfully defended his title against Anderson in a Last Man Standing match. Afterwards, as Anderson was being stretchered away, Ray attacked him and piledrived him onto the stage. While beginning a feud with Styles, the Bound for Glory Series winner, Ray was also dealing with the implosion of Aces &amp; Eights. On October 20 at Bound for Glory, Ray lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Styles in a No Disqualification match, ending his reign at 66 days.

On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray was attacked by the returning Mr. Anderson, who later in the evening, cost Ray his title rematch with Styles. Two weeks later, after teasing a break-up with Aces &amp; Eights, the group ambushed Anderson in retaliation. On November 21, at Turning Point, Mr. Anderson and Bully Ray faced off in a match where it was Anderson&#x27;s career vs. the Aces &amp; Eights stable. Anderson won, forcing the end of the Aces &amp; Eights.

On February 13, 2014, Bully Ray lost to Mr. Anderson in a Casket match, ending the feud.

==== Feud with the Carters and TNA Hall of Fame (2014–2015) ====
On March 9, Bully Ray was introduced by Dixie Carter to be the special guest referee for the Eight-Man Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown. During the match, he attacked Team Dixie&#x27;s captain, Bobby Roode, allowing Team MVP to be victorious, turning face once again. Ray then feuded with Roode, culminating in a match at Sacrifice; Carter interfered and cost Ray the match. Over the following weeks, Ray invaded TNA Headquarters and Dixie Carter&#x27;s home, threatening to put her through a table. On May 22, Dixie and Ethan Carter III came out to confront MVP and his alliance for their actions. But, when Ray interrupted the confrontation, he was ultimately laid out by MVP&#x27;s alliance and put through a table by EC3. On June 5, MVP along with EC3 and Rockstar Spud challenged Ray, Austin Aries and Samoa Joe to a First Blood Match, which Bully and his team won after Bully hit EC3 with a steel chain. At Slammiversary, Ray was defeated by EC3 after Bully went through a table from the top rope. Later that night it was announced that Ray, along with Devon, would be inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame as Team 3D at Bound for Glory. On August 7, Bully Ray finally succeeded in putting Dixie Carter through a table. At Bound for Glory, Team 3D defeated Tommy Dreamer and Abyss. This event was the final contracted date for each member of Team 3D.

On the May 8, 2015 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Ray made a one-night appearance as the special guest referee for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Kurt Angle and Eric Young. On the July 15 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Bully made his return to TNA, where he was revealed by Dixie Carter as the new general manager. However, it was announced on July 24 that Ray had departed from the company, due to being unhappy with the &quot;current state of affairs within the company.&quot;

=== Independent circuit (2013–2015) ===

On November 9, 2013, at &quot;HoH 3&quot;, Ray attacked Dreamer and Terry Funk following the main event, claiming that Dreamer offended him by not inviting him to the show, before challenging Dreamer to a falls-count-anywhere street fight at the TNA One Night Only pay-per-view event Old School.

<doc id="650405" wikidata="Q46463" url="?curid=650405" title="Spherical trigonometry">
<text>Spherical trigonometry is the branch of spherical geometry that deals with the metrical relationships between the sides and angles of spherical triangles, traditionally expressed using trigonometric functions. On the sphere, geodesics are great circles. Spherical trigonometry is of great importance for calculations in astronomy, geodesy, and navigation.

The origins of spherical trigonometry in Greek mathematics and the major developments in Islamic mathematics are discussed fully in History of trigonometry and Mathematics in medieval Islam. The subject came to fruition in Early Modern times with important developments by John Napier, Delambre and others, and attained an essentially complete form by the end of the nineteenth century with the publication of Todhunter&#x27;s textbook &quot;Spherical trigonometry for the use of colleges and Schools&quot;.
Since then, significant developments have been the application of vector methods, quaternion methods, and the use of numerical methods.

==Preliminaries==
===Spherical polygons===
A spherical polygon is a &quot;polygon&quot; on the surface of the sphere. Its sides are arcs of great circles—the spherical geometry equivalent of line segments in plane geometry.

Such polygons may have any number of sides greater than 1. Two-sided spherical polygons—&quot;lunes&quot;, also called &quot;digons&quot; or &quot;bi-angles&quot;—are bounded by two great-circle arcs: a familiar example is the curved outward-facing surface of a segment of an orange. Three arcs serve to define a spherical triangle, the principal subject of this article. Polygons with higher numbers of sides (4-sided spherical quadrilaterals, 5-sided spherical pentagons, etc.) are defined in similar manner. Analogously to their plane counterparts, spherical polygons with more than 3 sides can always be treated as the composition of spherical triangles.

One spherical polygon with interesting properties is the pentagramma mirificum, a 5-sided spherical star polygon with a right angle at every vertex.

From this point in the article, discussion will be restricted to spherical triangles, referred to simply as &quot;triangles&quot;.

===Notation===

*Both vertices and angles at the vertices of a triangle are denoted by the same upper case letters , , and .
*Sides are denoted by lower-case letters: , , and . The sphere has a radius of 1, and so the side lengths and lower case angles are equivalent (see arc length). 
*The &quot;angle&quot; (respectively, and ) may be regarded either as the dihedral angle between the two planes that intersect the sphere at the &quot;vertex&quot; , or, equivalently, as the angle between the tangents of the great circle arcs where they meet at the vertex.
*Angles are expressed in radians. The angles of &quot;proper&quot; spherical triangles are (by convention) less than , so that formula_1(Todhunter, Art.22,32). 
In particular, the sum of the angles of a spherical triangle is strictly greater than the sum of the angles of a triangle defined on the Euclidean plane, which is always exactly radians.
*Sides are also expressed in radians. A side (regarded as a great circle arc) is measured by the angle that it subtends at the centre. On the unit sphere, this radian measure is numerically equal to the arc length. By convention, the sides of &quot;proper&quot; spherical triangles are less than , so that formula_2(Todhunter, Art.22,32).
*The sphere&#x27;s radius is taken as unity. For specific practical problems on a sphere of radius the measured lengths of the sides must be divided by before using the identities given below. Likewise, after a calculation on the unit sphere the sides , , and must be multiplied by .

===Polar triangles===

The polar triangle associated with a triangle is defined as follows. Consider the great circle that contains the side . This great circle is defined by the intersection of a diametral plane with the surface. Draw the normal to that plane at the centre: it intersects the surface at two points and the point that is on the same side of the plane as is (conventionally) termed the pole of and it is denoted by . The points and are defined similarly.

The triangle is the polar triangle corresponding to triangle . A very important theorem (Todhunter, Art.27) proves that the angles and sides of the polar triangle are
given by
formula_3
Therefore, if any identity is proved for then we can immediately derive a second identity by applying the first identity to the polar triangle by making the above substitutions. This is how the supplemental cosine equations are derived from the cosine equations. Similarly, the identities for a quadrantal triangle can be derived from those for a right-angled triangle. The polar triangle of a polar triangle is the original triangle.

If the matrix has the positions , , and as its columns then the rows of the matrix inverse , if normalized to unit length, are the positions , , and . In particular, when is the polar triangle of then is the polar triangle of .

==Cosine rules and sine rules==

===Cosine rules===
The cosine rule is the fundamental identity of spherical trigonometry: all other identities, including the sine rule, may be derived from the cosine rule:
formula_4

These identities generalize the cosine rule of plane trigonometry, to which they are asymptotically equivalent
in the limit of small interior angles. (On the unit sphere, if formula_5 set formula_6 and formula_7 etc.; see Spherical law of cosines.)

===Sine rules===
The spherical law of sines is given by the formula
formula_8
These identities approximate the sine rule of plane trigonometry when the sides are much smaller than the radius of the sphere.

===Derivation of the cosine rule ===

The spherical cosine formulae were originally proved by elementary geometry and the planar cosine rule (Todhunter, Art.37). He also gives a derivation using simple coordinate geometry and the planar cosine rule (Art.60). The approach outlined here uses simpler vector methods. (These methods are also discussed at Spherical law of cosines.)
Consider three unit vectors drawn from the origin to the vertices of the triangle (on the unit sphere). The arc subtends an angle of magnitude at the centre and therefore . Introduce a Cartesian basis with along the -axis and in the -plane making an angle with the -axis. The vector projects to in the -plane and the angle between and the -axis is . Therefore, the three vectors have components:

formula_9

The scalar product in terms of the components is
formula_10
Equating the two expressions for the scalar product gives
formula_11
This equation can be re-arranged to give explicit expressions for the angle in terms of the sides:
formula_12

The other cosine rules are obtained by cyclic permutations.

===Derivation of the sine rule ===
This derivation is given in Todhunter, (Art.40). From the identity formula_13 and the explicit expression for given immediately above
formula_14
Since the right hand side is invariant under a cyclic permutation of , , and the spherical sine rule follows immediately.

===Alternative derivations===
There are many ways of deriving the fundamental cosine and sine rules and the other rules developed in the following sections. For example, Todhunter gives two proofs of the cosine rule (Articles 37 and 60) and two proofs of the sine rule (Articles 40 and 42). The page on Spherical law of cosines gives four different proofs of the cosine rule. Text books on geodesy and spherical astronomy give different proofs and the online resources of MathWorld provide yet more. There are even more exotic derivations, such as that of Banerjee who derives the formulae using the linear algebra of projection matrices and also quotes methods in differential geometry and the group theory of rotations.

The derivation of the cosine rule presented above has the merits of simplicity and directness and the derivation of the sine rule emphasises the fact that no separate proof is required other than the cosine rule. However, the above geometry may be used to give an independent proof of the sine rule. The scalar triple product, evaluates to in the basis shown. Similarly, in a basis oriented with the -axis along , the triple product , evaluates to . Therefore, the invariance of the triple product under cyclic permutations gives which is the first of the sine rules. See curved variations of the law of sines to see details of this derivation.

=== Differential variations ===
When any three of the differentials &quot;da&quot;, &quot;db&quot;, &quot;dc&quot;, &quot;dA&quot;, &quot;dB&quot;, &quot;dC&quot; are known, the following equations, which are found by differentiating the cosine rule and using the sine rule, can be used to calculate the other three by elimination:

formula_15

==Identities==

===Supplemental cosine rules===
Applying the cosine rules to the polar triangle gives (Todhunter, Art.47), &quot;i.e.&quot; replacing by , by etc.,
formula_16

===Cotangent four-part formulae===
The six parts of a triangle may be written in cyclic order as (). The cotangent, or four-part, formulae relate two sides and two angles forming four &quot;consecutive&quot; parts around the triangle, for example () or ). In such a set there are inner and outer parts: for example in the set () the inner angle is , the inner side is , the outer angle is , the outer side is . The cotangent rule may be written as (Todhunter, Art.44)
formula_17
and the six possible equations are (with the relevant set shown at right):
formula_18
To prove the first formula start from the first cosine rule and on the right-hand side substitute for from the third cosine rule:
formula_19
The result follows on dividing by . Similar techniques
with the other two cosine rules give CT3 and CT5. The other three equations follow by applying rules 1, 3 and 5 to the polar triangle.

===Half-angle and half-side formulae===
With formula_20 and formula_21
formula_22

Another twelve identities follow by cyclic permutation.

The proof (Todhunter, Art.49) of the first formula starts from the identity formula_23 using the cosine rule to express in terms of the sides and replacing the sum of two cosines by a product. (See sum-to-product identities.) The second formula starts from the identity formula_24 the third is a quotient and the remainder follow by applying the results to the polar triangle.

===Delambre analogies===
The Delambre analogies (also called Gauss analogies) were published independently by Delambre, Gauss, and Mollweide in 1807–1809.

formula_25
Another eight identities follow by cyclic permutation.

Proved by expanding the numerators and using the half angle formulae. (Todhunter, Art.54 and Delambre)

===Napier&#x27;s analogies===

formula_26

Another eight identities follow by cyclic permutation.

These identities follow by division of the Delambre formulae. (Todhunter, Art.52)

Taking quotients of these yields the law of tangents, first stated by Persian mathematician Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274),

formula_27

===Napier&#x27;s rules for right spherical triangles===
When one of the angles, say , of a spherical triangle is equal to /2 the various identities given above are considerably simplified. There are ten identities relating three elements chosen from the set , , , , and .

Napier provided an elegant mnemonic aid for the ten independent equations: the mnemonic is called Napier&#x27;s circle or Napier&#x27;s pentagon (when the circle in the above figure, right, is replaced by a pentagon).

First, write the six parts of the triangle (three vertex angles, three arc angles for the sides) in the order they occur around any circuit of the triangle: for the triangle shown above left, going clockwise starting with gives . Next replace the parts that are not adjacent to (that is , , and ) by their complements and then delete the angle from the list. The remaining parts can then be drawn as five ordered, equal slices of a pentagram, or circle, as shown in the above figure (right). For any choice of three contiguous parts, one (the &quot;middle&quot; part) will be adjacent to two parts and opposite the other two parts. The ten Napier&#x27;s Rules are given by
*sine of the middle part = the product of the tangents of the adjacent parts
*sine of the middle part = the product of the cosines of the opposite parts
The key for remembering which trigonometric function goes with which part is to look at the first vowel of the kind of part: middle parts take the sine, adjacent parts take the tangent, and opposite parts take the cosine.
For an example, starting with the sector containing we have:
formula_28
The full set of rules for the right spherical triangle is (Todhunter, Art.62)
formula_29

===Napier&#x27;s rules for quadrantal triangles===
A quadrantal spherical triangle is defined to be a spherical triangle in which one of the sides subtends an angle of /2 radians at the centre of the sphere: on the unit sphere the side has length /2. In the case that the side has length /2 on the unit sphere the equations governing the remaining sides and angles may be obtained by applying the rules for the right spherical triangle of the previous section to the polar triangle with sides such that , etc. The results are:
formula_30

===Five-part rules===
Substituting the second cosine rule into the first and simplifying gives:
formula_31
Cancelling the factor of gives
formula_32

Similar substitutions in the other cosine and supplementary cosine formulae give a large variety of 5-part rules. They are rarely used.

===Cagnoli&#x27;s Equation===
Multiplying the first cosine rule by gives
formula_33
Similarly multiplying the first supplementary cosine rule by yields
formula_34
Subtracting the two and noting that it follows from the sine rules that formula_35 produces Cagnoli&#x27;s equation
formula_36
which is a relation between the six parts of the spherical triangle.

== Solution of triangles ==
===Oblique triangles===
The solution of triangles is the principal purpose of spherical trigonometry: given three, four or five elements of the triangle, determine the others. The case of five given elements is trivial, requiring only a single application of the sine rule. For four given elements there is one non-trivial case, which is discussed below. For three given elements there are six cases: three sides, two sides and an included or opposite angle, two angles and an included or opposite side, or three angles. (The last case has no analogue in planar trigonometry.) No single method solves all cases. The figure below shows the seven non-trivial cases: in each case the given sides are marked with a cross-bar and the given angles with an arc. (The given elements are also listed below the triangle). In the summary notation here such as ASA, A refers to a given angle and S refers to a given side, and the sequence of A&#x27;s and S&#x27;s in the notation refers to the corresponding sequence in the triangle.
*Case 1: three sides given (SSS). The cosine rule may be used to give the angles , , and but, to avoid ambiguities, the half angle formulae are preferred.
*Case 2: two sides and an included angle given (SAS). The cosine rule gives and then we are back to Case 1.
*Case 3: two sides and an opposite angle given (SSA). The sine rule gives and then we have Case 7. There are either one or two solutions.
*Case 4: two angles and an included side given (ASA). The four-part cotangent formulae for sets () and () give and , then follows from the sine rule.
*Case 5: two angles and an opposite side given (AAS). The sine rule gives and then we have Case 7 (rotated). There are either one or two solutions.
*Case 6: three angles given (AAA). The supplemental cosine rule may be used to give the sides , , and but, to avoid ambiguities, the half-side formulae are preferred.
*Case 7: two angles and two opposite sides given (SSAA). Use Napier&#x27;s analogies for and ; or, use Case 3 (SSA) or case 5 (AAS).

The solution methods listed here are not the only possible choices: many others are possible. In general it is better to choose methods that avoid taking an inverse sine because of the possible ambiguity between an angle and its supplement. The use of half-angle formulae is often advisable because half-angles will be less than /2 and therefore free from ambiguity. There is a full discussion in Todhunter. The article Solution of triangles#Solving spherical triangles presents variants on these methods with a slightly different notation.

There is a full discussion of the solution of oblique triangles in Todhunter. See also the discussion in Ross. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi was the first to list the six distinct cases (2–7 in the diagram) of a right triangle in spherical trigonometry.

===Solution by right-angled triangles===
Another approach is to split the triangle into two right-angled triangles. For example, take the Case 3 example where , , and are given. Construct the great circle from that is normal to the side at the point . Use Napier&#x27;s rules to solve the triangle : use and to find the sides and and the angle . Then use Napier&#x27;s rules to solve the triangle : that is use and to find the side and the angles and . The angle and side follow by addition.

===Numerical considerations===
Not all of the rules obtained are numerically robust in extreme examples, for example when an angle approaches zero or . Problems and solutions may have to be examined carefully, particularly when writing code to solve an arbitrary triangle.

==Area and spherical excess==

Consider an -sided spherical polygon and let denote the -th interior angle. The area of such a polygon is given by (Todhunter, Art.99)
formula_37
For the case of a spherical triangle with angles , , and this reduces to Girard&#x27;s theorem
formula_38
where is the amount by which the sum of the angles exceeds radians, called the spherical excess of the triangle. This theorem is named after its author, Albert Girard. An earlier proof was derived, but not published, by the English mathematician Thomas Harriot. On a sphere of radius both of the above area expressions are multiplied by . The definition of the excess is independent of the radius of the sphere.

The converse result may be written as

formula_39

Since the area of a triangle cannot be negative the spherical excess is always positive. It is not necessarily small, because the sum of the angles may attain 5 (3 for &quot;proper&quot; angles). For example,
an octant of a sphere is a spherical triangle with three right angles, so that the excess is /2. In practical applications it &quot;is&quot; often small: for example the triangles of geodetic survey typically have a spherical excess much less than 1&#x27; of arc. On the Earth the excess of an equilateral triangle with sides 21.3 km (and area 393 km2) is approximately 1 arc second.

There are many formulae for the excess. For example, Todhunter, (Art.101—103) gives ten examples including that of L&#x27;Huilier:
formula_40
where formula_41. This formula is reminiscent of Heron&#x27;s formula for planar triangles.

Because some triangles are badly characterized by
their edges (e.g., if formula_42), it is often better to use
the formula for the excess in terms of two edges and their included angle
formula_43

When triangle is a right triangle with right angle at , then and , so this reduces to
formula_44

Angle deficit is defined similarly for hyperbolic geometry.

=== From latitude and longitude ===

The spherical excess of a spherical quadrangle bounded by the equator, the two meridians of longitudes formula_45 and formula_46 and the great-circle arc between two points with longitude and latitude formula_47 and formula_48 is
formula_49

This result is obtained from one of Napier&#x27;s analogies. In the limit where formula_50 are all small, this reduces to the familiar trapezoidal area, formula_51.

The area of a polygon can be calculated from individual quadrangles of the above type, from (analogously) individual triangle bounded by a segment of the polygon and two meridians, by a line integral with Green&#x27;s theorem, or via an equal-area projection as commonly done in GIS. The other algorithms can still be used with the side lengths calculated using a great-circle distance formula.

<text>NBCUniversal Media, LLC (abbreviated as NBCU and doing business as NBCUniversal or Comcast NBCUniversal since 2013) is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate owned by Comcast and headquartered at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It is primarily involved in the media and entertainment industry, and is named for its two most significant divisions—the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), one of the United States&#x27; Big Three television networks, and Universal Pictures, one of the major Hollywood film studios. 

It also has a significant presence in broadcasting through a portfolio of domestic and international properties, including USA, Syfy, Bravo, Oxygen, E!, Telemundo, Universal Kids, Golf Channel, CNBC, Universo, the streaming service Peacock and ownership stakes in Snap Inc. and Vox Media. Via its Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences division, NBCUniversal is also the third-largest operator of amusement parks in the world. Since 2018, its sister company under Comcast&#x27;s control, Sky Group, holds its media and telecommunications assets alongside Xfinity.

NBCUniversal was formed on May 11, 2004, as NBC Universal, Inc., when Vivendi sold 80% of Universal Pictures to the now-defunct General Electric, NBC&#x27;s then-owner. The sale gave Vivendi a 20% stake in NBC Universal, while GE held the remaining 80%. Comcast attained 51% and thereby control of the newly reformed NBCUniversal in 2011, by purchasing shares from GE, while GE bought out Vivendi’s stake. Since 2013, the company has been fully owned by Comcast, which bought the remaining 49% of the company from GE.

==History==

===Early history===
NBC and Universal Television had a partnership dating back to 1950, when Universal Television&#x27;s earliest ancestor, Revue Studios, produced a number of shows for NBC, although Revue would have hits on other networks as well. This partnership continued throughout a number of name changes and changes of ownership.

===Television===

NBC Universal Television has its modern roots in a series of expansions undertaken by NBC. In the late 1980s, NBC began pursuing a strategy of diversification, including the formation of two NBC-owned cable-television networks: CNBC and America&#x27;s Talking. NBC also had partial ownership of several regional sports channels and other cable channels such as American Movie Classics and Court TV (until 2007).

In 1995, NBC began operating NBC Desktop Video, a financial news service that delivered live video to personal computers. The following year, NBC announced an agreement with Microsoft to create an all-news cable television channel, MSNBC (using its subscriber base from America&#x27;s Talking network). A separate joint venture with Microsoft included establishing a news website, MSNBC.com (now NBCNews.com).

In 1998, NBC partnered with Dow Jones &amp; Co. The two companies combined their financial news channels outside the United States. The new networks included NBC Europe, CNBC Europe, NBC Asia, CNBC Asia, NBC Africa, and CNBC Africa.

In 1999, NBC took a 32% stake in the Paxson group, operator of PAX TV. Five years later, NBC decided to sell its interest in PAX TV and end its relationship with PAX owner, Paxson Communications.

In 2001, NBC acquired the US Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo, that includes the bilingual Mun2 Television for $1.98 billion. That same year NBC acquired the cable channel Bravo.

====Combining with Universal====
In 2004, amid a major financial crisis caused by over-expansion, Universal Studios&#x27; parent company, Vivendi Universal Entertainment (a division of the French company Vivendi, which also owned Blizzard Entertainment), decided to sell an 80% stake of itself to NBC&#x27;s parent company, General Electric (GE). The sale and resulting merger formed NBC Universal. The new company was 80% owned by GE, and 20% owned by Vivendi. The joint venture encompassed Vivendi&#x27;s US film interests (such as Universal Pictures), NBC Universal Television Studio, NBC Universal Television Distribution, production and distribution units, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, Universal Studios Consumer Products Group, Back Lot Music (formerly NBC Records), as well as five theme parks, cable television channels including USA Network, Sci-Fi Channel, the defunct Trio, Cloo (formerly Sleuth) as well as 50% stakes in Canal+ and StudioCanal. The Universal Music Group was not included in the deal and is not part of NBC Universal.

On August 2, 2004, the television divisions of NBC and Universal Television were combined to form NBC Universal Television. NBC Studios series brought into the company include the NBC dramas &quot;Las Vegas&quot; (with DreamWorks Television), &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, and &quot;American Dreams&quot;. Universal Network Television brought the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise and &quot;The District&quot;—in fact, Universal Network Television had co-produced &quot;American Dreams&quot; with NBC before the merger.
Universal Television Distribution shows also brought into company include &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; and &quot;Maury&quot;.
Entertainment shows produced by the new group include &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

The formation of NBC Universal saw the establishment of NBC Universal Cable, which oversees the distribution, marketing, and advertisement sales for thirteen channels (Bravo, Bravo HD+ (eventually renamed Universal HD), Chiller, CNBC, CNBC World, MSNBC, NBC Universo, Syfy, ShopNBC (which became ShopHQ after NBCUniversal sold its stake in the network), Telemundo, Cloo, USA Network, and the Olympic Games on cable). NBC Universal Cable also manages the company&#x27;s investments in The Weather Channel and TiVo. The cable division also used to operate NBC Weather Plus until 2008. It also owned a 50% stake in Canal+ and also owned a 15% stake in A+E Networks until 2012.

====Global expansion====
In the early 1990s, NBC began its expansion throughout Europe by creating CNBC Europe and its long-time successful NBC Europe Superstation by broadcasting NBC Giga throughout Germany and the rest of the European Union. NBC Europe helped to develop the Leipzig-based Games Convention, the largest European video game exposition with more than 100,000 visitors each year.

In 2005, NBC Universal joined HANA, the High-Definition Audio-Video Network Alliance to help establish standards in consumer electronics interoperability. Later that year, NBC Universal announced a partnership with Apple Computer to offer shows from all the NBC Universal TV networks on Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store.

In January 2006, NBC Universal launched a new cable channel, Sleuth. The channel&#x27;s programming dedicated to mystery/crime genre. Sleuth Network&#x27;s initial slogan was &quot;Mystery. Crime. All The Time.&quot; In early 2008, the channel unveiled a new slogan, &quot;Get Clued In.&quot; On August 15, 2011, Sleuth rebranded as Cloo, in order to be able to trademark and own the name, as NBCUniversal cannot so with the name Clue (as Hasbro owns the rights to it with its board game Clue). NBCUniversal also explained that another reason for the name change was the word &quot;Sleuth&quot; is too common for search engines (a Google search brings up over 9,530,000 results).

One year later after Sleuth&#x27;s debut, NBC Universal announced that the company would launch a horror-themed cable channel, Chiller, on March 1, 2007. At launch Chiller would be available exclusively on DirecTV. The network would feature films like &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot; and TV series that include &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot;, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. NBC Universal also stated that, aside from the content in its own vaults, Chiller will feature content from other studios as well. In 2009, Chiller unveiled a new slogan, &quot;scary good&quot;. This replaced the channel&#x27;s previous slogan &quot;Dare To Watch&quot;.

On June 14, 2007, NBC Universal Television Studio was renamed Universal Media Studios. The company explained that the reason for the name change was because &quot;the new name fully describes the company&#x27;s mission to be the premier content provider for television and digital platforms, spanning all television dayparts and creative genres.&quot;

In August 2007, NBC Universal purchased Sparrowhawk Media Group and renamed it NBC Universal Global Networks. This acquisition gave NBC Universal all Hallmark channels outside the United States, plus the English channels Diva TV, Movies 24, Hallmark Channel and KidsCo. Later that fall, the company also acquired the Oxygen network in a separate $925 million deal. The sale was completed one month later.

In the summer of 2008, NBC Universal, Blackstone Group and Bain Capital announced their intentions to buy The Weather Channel from Landmark Communications. The deal closed on September 12, 2008. Shortly after the acquisition completed, NBC announced that its existing TV weather network, NBC Weather Plus, would be shut down by December 31, 2008.

In July 2008, Universal Cable Productions split off from Universal Media Studios and moved into NBCUniversal&#x27;s NBCU Cable Entertainment division.

The summer of 2008 marked NBC Universal&#x27;s first venture into the United Kingdom by acquiring English television production company Carnival Films.

On November 12, 2008, NBC Universal acquired 80.1% of Geneon Entertainment from Dentsu in Japan, merging it with Universal Pictures International Entertainment to form a new company, Geneon Universal Entertainment Japan.

On March 16, 2009, NBC Universal-owned cable channel Sci Fi announced that it would be changing its name to Syfy, replacing a generic term with a proprietary brand name that was able to be trademarked. The re-branding and name change took place on July 7, 2009.

On August 27, 2009, A&amp;E Television Networks (A&amp;E) merged with Lifetime Entertainment Services (Lifetime), giving NBC Universal an equal share of both Lifetime and A&amp;E with The Walt Disney Company and Hearst.

On October 20, 2010, NBC Universal-owned horror/suspense-themed cable channel Chiller announced a major rebranding campaign incorporating a new logo and on-air look that launched on Wednesday, October 27, 2010. Syfy and Chiller President Dave Howe said, &quot;We have very ambitious plans to grow this network as a brand.&quot;

===Comcast era (2011–present)===

On December 3, 2009, after months of rumors, a deal was formally announced in which Comcast would buy a stake in NBC Universal from GE for $6.5 billion after the spin-off of certain businesses, pending regulatory approval. Under the agreement, NBC Universal would be controlled with a 51% stake by Comcast and GE would retain the remaining 49%. The deal includes a provision under which Comcast must contribute $7.5 billion in programming including regional sports networks and cable channels such as Golf Channel, Versus, PBS Kids Sprout and E! Entertainment Television. GE used some of the funds, $5.8 billion, to buy out Vivendi&#x27;s 20% minority stake in NBC Universal. Under the terms of the deal, Comcast reserved the right to buy out GE&#x27;s share at certain times, and GE reserved the right to force the sale of its stake within the first seven years. Vivendi completed the initial transaction on September 27, 2010, selling a $2 billion stake to GE (approximately 7.66%).

U.S. regulators approved the proposed sale on January 18, 2011, with conditions. Comcast would have to give up NBC control over online video site Hulu and ensure NBC Universal programming is available to competing cable operators. The company unveiled a new logo designed by Wolff Olins, which replaced a logo featuring the NBC peacock and an invocation of the Universal Pictures globe, with a wordmark. The company also began to stylize its name in CamelCase as &quot;NBCUniversal&quot; rather than &quot;NBC Universal&quot;, to reflect the unity of its two main divisions.

On January 26, 2011, Vivendi sold the remaining 20% of NBC Universal to GE, giving GE complete control of the company ahead of the completion of the sale of 51% of the company to Comcast on January 28, 2011. Comcast and GE formed the joint venture holding company NBCUniversal, LLC. NBC Universal, Inc. became a unit of Comcast and adopted the name NBCUniversal Media, LLC, on January 29, 2011.

Comcast had planned to buy out GE&#x27;s 49% stake over the following seven years, but ownership of NBCUniversal remained split at 51–49% for two years, until the February 12, 2013 announcement that Comcast intended to complete the $16.7 billion purchase early, all at once. The sale was completed on March 19, 2013.

The corporation on July 19, 2012, formed the NBCUniversal News Group with the NBC News, CNBC, and MSNBC divisions. That same year, Comcast sold their stake in A&amp;E Networks to Disney and Hearst, making the company a 50-50 joint venture.

In February 2013, NBCUniversal merged its two cable divisions, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment &amp; Cable Studios and NBCUniversal Entertainment &amp; Digital Networks and Integrated Media, into one unit while moving out Telemundo and Mun2 to a new division, NBCUniversal Hispanic Enterprises and Content. The move also created the corporate-level position of executive vice president in charge of digital ventures. In July, the company placed NBC TV Stations and Telemundo&#x27;s O&amp;Os stations into a new division, NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations, with New England Cable News being transferred into NBC TV Stations.

On April 28, 2016, NBCUniversal officially announced its intent to acquire DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion. Universal Pictures took over the distribution for DreamWorks Animation films after its deal with 20th Century Fox expired. The sale was approved by board members, but was subject to regulatory approval. On June 21, 2016, the acquisition was approved by the United States Department of Justice. On August 22, 2016, the deal was completed, and DreamWorks Animation is now a wholly owned subsidiary of NBCUniversal and was integrated into Universal Pictures. This gave Universal Pictures distribution to both DreamWorks Animation and Illumination films beginning in 2019. The company later sold its stake in A&amp;E to Disney and Hearst, making it a 50-50 joint venture.

On February 28, 2017, NBCUniversal announced that it would acquire the remaining 49% stake in the Universal Studios Japan theme park that it did not own.

On May 1, 2017, NBCUniversal announced that Sprout would be relaunched as Universal Kids on September 9, 2017. Universal Pictures&#x27; acquisition of DreamWorks Animation in 2016 would also be leveraged by Universal Kids to bolster its programming. Industry observers felt that the integration of DreamWorks IP with Universal Kids would help NBCUniversal establish a viable multi-platform competitor to other major children&#x27;s networks such as Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel.

On May 10, 2017, NBCUniversal announced that it had acquired Denver-based online platform Craftsy for its Cable Entertainment Group division.

====Attempted buyout of 21st Century Fox assets and subsequent acquisition of Sky====
On November 16, 2017, NBCUniversal&#x27;s parent company Comcast made a bid to acquire 21st Century Fox&#x27;s filmed entertainment, cable entertainment, and international assets, ten days after The Walt Disney Company (at the time, owners of rival network ABC, cable sports channel ESPN and theme parks Disneyland and Walt Disney World) was reported to be negotiating with Fox for the same assets. The deal contained key assets such as the 20th Century Fox film and television studios, 30% stake in Hulu, television assets FX Networks, National Geographic Channel, and international television operations such as Star India, while excluding the Fox Broadcasting Company, the Fox News Channel, Fox Television Stations, Fox Business Network, Fox Sports 1 and 2, Fox Deportes, and the Big Ten Network, all of which were spun off into the &quot;New Fox&quot; company (later known as the Fox Corporation) run by the Murdoch family.

However, on December 11, 2017, Comcast officially dropped the bid, saying that &quot;We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.&quot; On December 14, 2017, Disney officially confirmed its acquisition of the most 21st Century Fox assets, which was granted approval from the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division on June 27, 2018, and approved by stockholders from both companies one month later.

On April 25, 2018, Comcast launched its takeover offer for Sky plc at £12.50 per-share, or approximately £22.1 billion. 21st Century Fox owned a significant stake in Sky and was trying to take full control of it itself, ahead of its own acquisition by The Walt Disney Company. NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke stated that purchasing Sky would roughly double its presence in English-speaking markets, and allow for synergies between the respective networks and studios of NBCUniversal and Sky. On June 5, 2018, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock cleared both 21st Century Fox and Comcast&#x27;s respective offers to acquire Sky plc. Fox&#x27;s offer was contingent on the divestiture of Sky News. On June 15, 2018, the European Commission gave antitrust clearance to Comcast&#x27;s offer to purchase Sky, citing that in terms of its current assets in Europe, there would be limited impact on competition. Comcast included a 10-year commitment to the operations and funding of Sky News. On July 11, 2018, Fox increased its bid for Sky to £14.00 per-share, valuing it at £24.5 billion. Comcast subsequently counterbid just hours later with an offer at £14.75 per-share, valued at £26 billion.

On September 20, 2018, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ordered that a blind auction be held &quot;in order to provide an orderly framework for the resolution of this competitive situation&quot;. In this process, Fox, followed by Comcast, made new cash-only bids for Sky. After these first two rounds of bidding, there would be a third round where both companies could make new offers. However, the third round of bidding would only be binding if both companies make a bid. Comcast won the auction with a bid of £17.28 per-share, beating Fox&#x27;s bid of £15.67. Sky plc had until October 11, 2018, to formally accept this offer.

Following its auction victory, Comcast began to acquire Sky shares from the open market. On September 26, 2018, Fox subsequently announced its intent to sell all of its shares in Sky plc to Comcast for £12 billion. On October 4, 2018, Fox completed the sale of its shares, giving Comcast a 76.8% controlling stake at the time. On October 12, 2018, Comcast announced it will compulsorily acquire the rest of Sky after its bid gained acceptances from 95.3% of the broadcaster&#x27;s shareholders with the company being delisted by early 2019. Sky was delisted on November 7, 2018, after Comcast acquired all remaining shares.

While NBCUniversal and Sky still operate mainly as separate entities within Comcast, following the Sky takeover Comcast has begun the process of integrating some of NBCUniversal&#x27;s international operations with parts of Sky. Among other moves, NBCUniversal&#x27;s pay television channels in the United Kingdom will be folded with Sky&#x27;s, and Sky Deutschland will become the parent company of NBCU&#x27;s German networks.

====Preparation of Peacock streaming service====
On January 14, 2019, NBCUniversal announced that it will launch an over-the-top streaming service to compete with Netflix, CBS All Access, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Disney+. A reorganization of the major direct reporting division was made. Bonnie Hammer was appointed chairman of NBCUniversal Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises via the streaming services and the Digital Enterprises unit. Her former unit, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group, was given to Mark Lazarus as chairman, NBCUniversal Broadcast, Cable, Sports and News. Universal Filmed Entertainment Group chairman Jeff Shell added NBC Entertainment, Telemundo and international channels as chairman of NBCUniversal Film and Entertainment. On September 17, 2019, NBCUniversal announced the service would be called Peacock and is expected to launch in July 2020.

NBCUniversal Content Studios was formed in October 2019 with Hammer as chairman and George Cheeks as vice chairman, who was co-chairman of NBC Entertainment. This new unit consists of Universal Television and Universal Content Productions. Hammer was replaced as chairman of the Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises unit by Comcast executive Matt Strauss, while Paul Telegdy would become sole chairman of NBC Entertainment and continue reporting to Shell.

On February 25, 2020, Comcast announced it would purchase Xumo from the Panasonic/Viant joint venture for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition of the service—which will continue to operate as an independent business, albeit within Comcast&#x27;s cable television division—stems mainly from Xumo&#x27;s partnerships with smart TV manufacturers (including LG, Panasonic, and Vizio), which would allow Comcast to use Xumo&#x27;s placement to market or showcase Xfinity and other Comcast services as well as use its technology to develop additional streaming platforms. The company plans to add content from the NBCUniversal programming library and the company&#x27;s various television networks as well as use it to upsell its free/subscription hybrid service Peacock, akin to ViacomCBS&#x27;s utilization of Pluto TV to offer content from its cable networks following the former Viacom&#x27;s purchase of the rival streamer in the Spring of 2019.

====Vudu acquisition====
In February 2020, it was reported that Comcast (via NBCUniversal) had entered talks into acquiring Vudu from Walmart. On April 20, 2020, Fandango (jointly owned by Comcast and WarnerMedia) announced that it would be acquiring Vudu. The acquisition was completed on July 6, 2020. Vudu was renamed Fandango at Home in 2024.

====Restructuring and spin-off of certain assets====
Following Jeff Shell&#x27;s exit in 2023, NBCUniversal announced that corporate management will be led by a leadership team while Michael J. Cavanagh continues to oversee Comcast as a whole.

On November 20, 2024, Comcast announced that it will spin off most of its cable networks and selected digital properties into a new publicly-traded company, referred to under the interim name &quot;SpinCo&quot;; the spin-off seeks to separate the networks from businesses such as the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks and its divisions, Peacock, Hayu, Universal Pictures, Universal Studio Group, its international channels and Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences, while providing them with the ability to make their own further investments and acquisitions. 

&quot;SpinCo&quot; will include networks such as USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, E!, Golf Channel, Oxygen, and Syfy, as well as digital properties such as Fandango Media and SportsEngine. NBCUniversal will retain Bravo, as the network is a major provider of content to Peacock. It will also exclude Universal Kids, which NBCUniversal later announced would close in March 2025. Shares in &quot;SpinCo&quot; will be distributed to Comcast shareholders and trade independently thereafter; it will have the same share structure as Comcast, with Brian L. Roberts and his family holding a 33% voting share.

Questions have been raised over how the spin-off will impact the synergies between the networks and legacy divisions being retained by NBCUniversal (including in particular, the NBC News and NBC Sports divisions). When asked about the impact of the spin-off, NBC Sports president Rick Cordell stated that the division would &quot;fulfill every obligation&quot; it has with networks that are part of the spin-off (such as USA Network and Golf Channel), implicating they will still carry NBC Sports programming covered under current contracts (such as the Olympic Games and PGA Tour).

<doc id="650413" wikidata="Q1209452" url="?curid=650413" title="D-Von Dudley">
<text>Devon Hughes ( ; born August 1, 1972) is an American retired professional wrestler and YouTuber. He is signed to WWE, under a legends contract. He is best known for performing in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1995 to 1999 and for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) eventually renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as an in-ring competitor from 1999 to 2005 and from 2015 to 2016 as D-Von Dudley and Reverend D-Von. He also performed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) from 2005 to 2014 as Brother Devon and Devon.

Hughes is an accomplished tag team wrestler, notably achieving a majority of his success with Mark LoMonaco (best known as Bubba Ray Dudley, Brother Ray and Bully Ray) as part of the Dudley Boyz (known as Team 3D in TNA), with the team characterized by their unorthodox ring attire, hard-hitting style and usage of tables in their matches. He is recognized by TNA as a 23-time world tag team champion, and became part of the first tag team inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. They are considered one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era. Including his two TNA Television Championship reigns, Hughes has held 25 major championships between ECW, WWE, TNA and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Hughes and LoMonaco were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018 as part of the Dudley Boyz.

== Professional wrestling career==

=== Training and independent circuit (1991–1996) ===
Hughes was trained by Johnny Rodz and began wrestling in 1991, competing in independent promotions in the Northeast.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996–1999) ===

In March 1996, Hughes debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling, wrestling on a house show as &quot;A-Train&quot;. On April 13, 1996, at Massacre on Queens Boulevard, Hughes reappeared as &quot;D-Von Dudley&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Devon&quot;). His character was based on Jules Winnfield, the Bible-quoting hitman portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson in the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Dudley feuded with the other members of Dudley Brothers (his kayfabe half-brothers), claiming that their comedic antics were not the way true Dudleys should act, and faced Buh Buh Ray Dudley on numerous occasions, defeating him at Ultimate Jeopardy, but losing to him at November to Remember. Dudley eliminated Chubby Dudley and Dances with Dudley before joining forces with Buh Buh Ray, Big Dick Dudley, Sign Guy Dudley, and Joel Gertner. Known collectively as Dudley Boyz, D-Von and Buh Buh Ray dominated the ECW tag team division, winning the ECW World Tag Team Championship a record eight times and defeating teams such as The Eliminators and The Gangstas. D-Von, Buh Buh Ray, and Gertner all achieved a degree of infamy for their vitriolic interviews, which antagonized audiences to a point of near riot.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1999–2005) ===

====The Dudley Boyz (1999–2002)====

In mid-1999, Bubba Ray and D-Von left ECW following a pay dispute and debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in September. Throughout 2000 and 2001, the Dudley Boyz engaged in a three-way feud for the WWF Tag Team Championship with the Hardy Boyz and Edge &amp; Christian. The feud incorporated the first triangle ladder match at WrestleMania 2000, and two Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches, the first at SummerSlam in August 2000 and the second at WrestleMania X-Seven. While they were initially villains and were known for driving women through tables, the Dudley Boyz became fan favorites in early 2000. In early 2001, they were joined by Spike Dudley. At Survivor Series, the Dudley Boyz won the WWF Tag Team Championship, which they unified with the WCW Tag Team Championship during The Invasion, a storyline where the wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) invaded the WWF.

====Singles competition (2002)====
Following WrestleMania X8 the company divided the roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown! in March 2002. The Dudley Boyz were separated when D-Von was drafted to the SmackDown! brand and Bubba Ray ended up on the Raw brand. D-Von became a villainous reverend character under the name Reverend D-Von initially serving as Mr. McMahon&#x27;s &quot;spiritual advisor&quot;, and later alongside his protégé Deacon Batista. Though the gimmick was a launching platform for Batista&#x27;s career, it didn&#x27;t last long and Reverend D-Von was betrayed by Batista. He did pick up one of his most memorable individual victories of his WWE career when he pinned Triple H on May 9, 2002, on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after Chris Jericho hit Triple H with Reverend D-Von&#x27;s collection box.

====Return of The Dudley Boyz (2002–2005)====
He eventually turned face after he reunited with Bubba Ray and Spike on November 17, 2002, at Survivor Series when he helped Bubba Ray, Spike and Jeff Hardy defeat 3-Minute Warning and Rico in a tables match. The Dudley Boyz then became a stable in the &quot;Raw&quot; tag team division over the next sixteen months, feuding with teams such as 3-Minute Warning, La Résistance, and various combinations of The Un-Americans. They held the World Tag Team Championship several more times before being traded (along with Booker T) to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on March 22, 2004, in exchange for Triple H.

After getting drafted to Smackdown, The Dudley Boyz turned heel once again by aligning with Paul Heyman. On May 27, 2004, the Dudley Boyz kidnapped Paul Bearer, the manager of Heyman&#x27;s enemy The Undertaker. On June 27, 2004, at The Great American Bash, The Undertaker defeated the Dudley Boyz in a handicap match. They also won the WWE Tag Team Championship one more time but were upset by the high-flying team of Paul London and Billy Kidman. In July 2004, the Dudley Boyz reunited with Spike. For the remainder of the year, they assisted Spike in his matches for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship.

In early 2005, the Dudley Boyz were removed from WWE television and sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling while the WWE creative team attempted to devise a storyline for them. The Dudley Boyz returned to WWE television in June 2005 in order to promote ECW One Night Stand, an ECW reunion show. In the weeks preceding ECW One Night Stand they, along with several other ECW alumni, vied with former WCW President Eric Bischoff and his &quot;anti-hardcore crusaders&quot;. At ECW One Night Stand on June 12, the Dudley Boyz defeated Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in the main event.

On July 5, 2005, WWE announced that it had opted not to continue contract renewal negotiations with the Dudley Boyz. Concurrently, fifteen other wrestlers were released by WWE, . In August 2005, they were issued with legal notices instructing them not to use the (WWE trademarked) name &quot;Dudley&quot;. This led to a degree of acrimony between the former Dudleys and their erstwhile employers, as they had used the names since 1996, several years before all ECW intellectual property was acquired by WWE in 2003 as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. Both believed Paul Heyman had granted them the rights to the name. Soon after, the duo announced that they intended to pursue legal action against WWE.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2014; 2023) ===

==== Team 3D (2005–2010) ====

No longer able to use the ring name &quot;D-Von Dudley&quot;, Hughes adopted (and trademarked) the ring name Brother Devon Deadly, while LoMonaco became &quot;Brother Ray Deadly&quot;. The team also trademarked &quot;The Deadly Brothers&quot; and &quot;Deadly Death Drop&quot;. In August and September 2005, Devon and Ray made several appearances on the independent circuit, most notably Hardcore Homecoming, an unofficial ECW reunion show organized by ECW alumnus Shane Douglas, a frequent critic of WWE and Chairman Vince McMahon. On September 21, Hughes (together with LoMonaco) signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, under the name of &quot;Brother Devon&quot;.

Devon and Ray debuted in TNA on the October 8 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;. Team 3D quickly established themselves as fan favorites by confronting NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett and his allies, the NWA World Tag Team Champions, America&#x27;s Most Wanted. Team 3D defeated AMW at pay-per-view events in November and December, but failed to defeat them in a title match at Final Resolution on January 15, 2006, due to the interference of Team Canada. Devon and Ray continued to feud with America&#x27;s Most Wanted and Team Canada over the following months. On the April 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, an attempted ambush by Team Canada was foiled by the debuting Spike Dudley, identified as &quot;Brother Runt&quot;.

Devon and Ray then took time off to tour Japan, before returning to compete in tag team matches on &quot;Impact!&quot; and soon began feuding with NWA World Tag Team Champions The Latin American Xchange (LAX). At Final Resolution, they beat LAX by disqualification. Subsequently, they lost to LAX in a &quot;Little Italy Street Fight&quot; at Against All Odds, and a &quot;Ghetto Brawl&quot; at Destination X. At Lockdown, Team 3D defeated LAX in a Steel Cage match to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They were the final NWA World Tag Team Champions in TNA as on May 13, 2007, the NWA stripped them of the Tag Titles and Christian Cage of the NWA World Heavyweight Title due to Cage&#x27;s refusal to defend the title in NWA territories, and cut business ties with TNA. The successfully defended their status as World Tag Team Champions at Sacrifice later that evening. Because of this, TNA awarded Team 3D the new TNA World Tag Team Championships and crowned them as the first champions. They feuded with several tag teams before losing the belts to Samoa Joe at Victory Road.
At Final Resolution, they teamed with Johnny Devine and took part in an Ultimate X match against The Motor City Machine Guns and &quot;Black Machismo&quot;. They won by taking the X Division belt down with a ladder while the referee was not looking. At Against All Odds, a rematch took place in a Hardcore Street Fight. Early in the match, the Motor City Machine Guns were &#x27;taken out&#x27; with two 3-Ds, leaving Jay Lethal to singlehandedly save the X-Division. As a result of their loss at AAO, both Devon and Ray were subjected to weigh-ins prior to their matches. If they weighed in over 275 pounds, they would be unable to compete. During this time, they engaged in a feud with Christopher Daniels under his Curry Man gimmick, and Shark Boy. At Destination X, Team 3D was given an ultimatum when Curry Man and Shark Boy won an elimination match to choose the stipulation for each of the wrestlers matches;if they weighed in at over 275 pounds, the duo would be fired; but if they weighed in under, they would never again be subjected to the weigh-ins. They were able to weigh in under the mark, but Team 3D would end up losing to Curry Man and Shark Boy after a blinded Ray accidentally helped Curry Man hit Devon with the 3-D.

On the November 28 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Team 3D turned into fan favorites, joining The Front Line. After appearing to join The Main Event Mafia, they double-crossed them, and attacked along with The Front Line leaders Samoa Joe, AJ Styles and Rhino. At Lockdown Team 3D won the TNA World Tag Team Championship and retained the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm). At Slammiversary they lost the TNA tag titles to Beer Money, Inc. and on the July 30 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; the IWGP tag titles to The British Invasion of Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams. On October 18, 2009, at Bound for Glory, Team 3D captured their 24th tag team championship when they defeated Beer Money, British Invasion, and The Main Event Mafia&#x27;s Scott Steiner and Booker T in a Full Metal Mayhem Tag Team match. With both the IWGP and TNA Tag tiles on the line, they captured the IWGP titles which were formerly held by The British Invasion. During the following weeks Team 3D turned heel and aligned themselves with Rhino in a battle against the younger talent of the company. On the November 19 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Team 3D Academy of Professional Wrestling and Sports Entertainment graduate Jesse Neal joined Team 3D and Rhino and two weeks later Suicide joined Morgan, Hernandez and D&#x27;Angelo Dinero to level the playing field. At Final Resolution Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. On January 4, 2010, at Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome Team 3D lost the IWGP Tag Team Title to No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro) in a three-way hardcore match, which also included Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson). When Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff took over TNA at the beginning of 2010, Team 3D&#x27;s angle with Rhino and Neal was discontinued and they reverted to being faces, while starting a feud with The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), who were a part of the new wave of wrestlers brought in by Hogan and Bischoff. At Against All Odds The Nasty Boys defeated Team 3D in a tag team match, when Jimmy Hart made his return to the company and interfered in the match on the Nasty Boys&#x27; behalf. Team 3D avenged their loss on the February 25 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when Jesse Neal helped them defeat the Nasty Boys in a tables match. On the March 15 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Team 3D and Neal were scheduled to face the Nasty Boys and Hart in a six-man tag team match, but prior to the match the Nasty Boys attacked Neal backstage and put him through a table. Team 3D found Neal a replacement in the returning Brother Runt, but were still defeated in the match by the Nastys and Hart. However, after the match Neal made the save for Team 3D and helped them put Sags through a table. In May Ray turned heel by attacking Neal, while Devon remained a face and stood up for his student against his brother. At Victory Road Devon faced Jesse Neal and Ray in a three-way match. During the match the members of Team 3D attacked each other, before Neal accidentally speared Devon and was then pinned by Ray. On the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Devon joined fellow ECW alumni Mick Foley, Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Pat Kenney and Al Snow and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam in attacking Abyss, Brother Ray and the rest of the TNA locker room. The following week, Ray declined Devon&#x27;s offer to join the ECW alumni, before TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay–per–view event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company. However, on the July 29 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Ray decided to join the ECW alumni and seemingly buried the hatchet with his brother. On August 8 at Hardcore Justice Team 3D, accompanied by Joel Gertner, defeated Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney, billed as Kahoneys, in a South Philadelphia Street Fight. After the match Devon and Ray were assaulted by the Gangstas. On the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni, known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they didn&#x27;t deserve to be in TNA. This would mark Team 3D&#x27;s final appearance on their old TNA contracts, which expired shortly thereafter. The two then entered negotiations over new contracts. Team 3D returned to TNA television two month later on the October 7 live edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, promising a major announcement at Bound for Glory. At the pay-per-view Team 3D announced their retirement, but asked for a one final match against the TNA World Tag Team Champions, the Motor City Machine Guns. Their new multi–year contracts with TNA were confirmed shortly thereafter. At Turning Point the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Team 3D to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.

==== Television Champion (2010–2012) ====
During Team 3D&#x27;s retirement ceremony on the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Ray turned heel by attacking Devon, reigniting the feud between the two. The following week Ray claimed that Devon had gotten weak, since Sabin had managed to kick out of a 3D at Turning Point, calling him the Marty Jannetty and himself the Shawn Michaels of the team. On January 9, 2011, at Genesis, Devon was disqualified in his match against his former partner, now known as Bully Ray, after using Ray&#x27;s own chain against him. In the following weeks Devon&#x27;s sons Terrence and Terrell began making appearances on &quot;Impact!&quot; and were regularly abused by Ray. At Against All Odds Devon faced his former tag team partner in a Street Fight. After Devon&#x27;s sons Terrell and Terrence interfered in the match, Ray low-blowed him and pinned one of his sons for the win. On March 13 at Victory Road, Devon and his sons interfered in a Falls Count Anywhere match between Ray and Tommy Dreamer, costing Ray the match. On the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the feud between the former members of Team 3D was seemingly ended as Ray joined Immortal and moved on to feuding with Fortune.
In June, Devon entered a storyline where he was saved from Mexican America by D&#x27;Angelo Dinero, despite the fact that he had previously declined his help, claiming that he was a bad influence on his sons. Later that month, Devon and Dinero were both entered into the Bound for Glory Series to determine the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, during the course of which Dinero handed Devon a win in a tag team match, but Devon did not return the favor and save Dinero from a post-match assault at the hands of Samoa Joe. During the tournament, Devon also picked up impressive victories over Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles. On August 7 at Hardcore Justice, Dinero defeated Devon in a Bound for Glory Series match. At the start of the match, Dinero offered to lay down for Devon, but he refused the offer. On the August 25 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Devon was forced to pull out of the Bound for Glory Series, after suffering a storyline injury at the hands of Samoa Joe, who had vowed to ruin the tournament. Later in the event, Devon returned to save Dinero from a similar attack at the hands of Joe. On the September 8 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Devon and Dinero defeated The British Invasion to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On September 11 at No Surrender, Devon and Dinero failed in their attempt to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship from Anarquia and Hernandez of Mexican America. On the December 1 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Devon and Dinero defeated Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore) and Mexican America to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship, now held by the team of Crimson and Matt Morgan. On December 11 at Final Resolution, Devon and Dinero failed to capture the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the following edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Dinero and Devon&#x27;s sons Terrence and Terrell joined forces and turned on Devon. On January 8, 2012, at Genesis, Terrence and Terrell turned on Dinero and helped their father defeat him in a singles match.

On March 18 at Victory Road, Devon answered Robbie E&#x27;s open challenge and defeated him to win the TNA Television Championship, marking Devon&#x27;s first major singles championship. On April 15 at Lockdown, Devon defeated Robbie in a rematch, contested inside a steel cage, to retain the title. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, general manager Hulk Hogan announced that from then on the Television Championship would be defended every week on the program. Devon started his series of defenses by defeating Gunner. During the next month, Devon developed a rivalry with Robbie E and Robbie T, successfully defending the Television Championship against each of them in singles matches on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; and finally in a three-way match on May 13 at Sacrifice. On the May 24 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Robbie E and Robbie T interfered in a TNA Television Championship match between Devon and Garett Bischoff, causing the match to end in a no contest. Following the match, Devon and Bischoff united to fend off the attack by the two. The following week, the Robbies also interfered in Devon&#x27;s title defense against Jeff Hardy, causing another no contest. On the June 7 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Devon successfully defended the Television Championship against Robbie E, following outside interference from Garett Bischoff. Three days later at Slammiversary, Devon and Bischoff defeated the Robbies in a tag team match. Devon&#x27;s weekly Television Championship defenses ended after the June 14 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where he successfully defended the title against Hernandez. Devon returned to &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; on August 9, when he and Garett Bischoff unsuccessfully challenged Christopher Daniels and Kazarian for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Three days later at Hardcore Justice, Devon successfully defended the TNA Television Championship against Kazarian. On August 29, Devon, still the reigning TNA Television Champion, announced that he had parted ways with TNA, after his contract with the promotion had expired the previous day and the two could not come to terms on a new one. With Devon still being recognized as the TNA Television Champion, on September 15, 2012, he became the longest reigning champion in the title&#x27;s history, beating Eric Young&#x27;s record of 180 days as champion. On September 26, TNA officially stripped Devon of the Television Championship, ending his reign at 192 days.

==== Aces &amp; Eights (2012–2013) ====
On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Devon returned to TNA turning heel, when he attacked Bully Ray and Sting, costing them their tag team match against the heel Aces &amp; Eights stable, who, as a result, earned full access to TNA.

On November 1, Devon and Bully Ray faced off in the main event of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, however, the match ended in a brawl between the Aces &amp; Eights and the TNA locker room. On November 11 at Turning Point, Devon was defeated by Kurt Angle in singles match via submission, despite the rest of Aces &amp; Eights trying to interfere. On the December 6 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Devon defeated Samoa Joe to win his second Television Championship, after Aces &amp; Eights member DOC hit Joe with a ball-peen hammer. Three days later at Final Resolution, Devon teamed with DOC and two masked members of Aces &amp; Eights in a losing effort to Kurt Angle, Garett Bischoff, Samoa Joe, and Wes Brisco. On the December 20 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Devon successfully defended the Television Championship against Kurt Angle, following interference from Aces &amp; Eights, Garett Bischoff, Samoa Joe, and Wes Brisco.

Samoa Joe was then awarded the title match in his place, but Devon retained the title after interference from Aces &amp; Eights. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Devon was originally booked to defend his title against Joseph Park but Park was attacked by Aces &amp; Eights before the match and Devon was awarded a count-out victory.

<doc id="650414" wikidata="Q3436010" url="?curid=650414" title="Political moderate">
<text>Moderate is an ideological category which entails centrist views on a liberal-conservative spectrum. It may also designate a rejection of radical or extreme views, especially in regard to politics and religion. 

== Political position ==
=== Canada ===
At the federal level in Canada as of 2024, there are five active political parties who have seats in the House of Commons, for which most of them have a wide range of goals and political opinions, that differ between each others. Per definition, where &quot;political moderate&quot; is used, in a specific context to being far conservative, the Conservative Party of Canada could be used as a representation. However, we can now see that those beliefs might contain &quot;inverted&quot; or different effects-opinions. If we could measure them from a &quot;political spectrum&quot; point of view, the variations for instance, conservatism, who tend to be defined in the same way toward being resistant with the idea of future changes, is not always the case.

In parallel, liberalism, as to The Liberal Party of Canada could also include different versions to quantify, or &quot;weight&quot; the possible outcomes of the most distant paramount. For example, Canadians citizens are protected by law, and free of action or speech, defined by the Canadian Charter of Rights, and from that same consideration, one, must not surpass or challenge to act against that same charter. From there we should perceive that even inside the epicenter of a &quot;liberal mechanism&quot; or political parties, in many cases there are still forms of hierarchical, composable or modular sets of rules or policies as basics threshold. Moreover, political moderate, aim to be scrupulous during an individual said state of affairs, resolving with actual information&#x27;s or data, to determine the best scenario possible, within the available choices, at that moment in time.

=== Japan ===
Japan&#x27;s right-wing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has traditionally been divided into two main factions: the based on bureaucratic &quot;conservative mainstream&quot; (保守本流) and the hawkish nationalist &quot;conservative anti-mainstream&quot; (保守傍流). Among them, &quot;conservative mainstream&quot; is also considered a moderate wing within the LDP. The LDP&#x27;s faction &quot;Kōchikai&quot; is considered a moderate wing. The current LDP has conflicts between moderate patriotist and extreme nationalist supporters.

The Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) was formed by a group of politicians who splintered off of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) in 1960. The party advocated a moderate social-democratic politics and supported the U.S.-Japan Alliance. The party started to slowly support neoliberalism from the 1980s, and was disbanded in 1994.

Moderate social-democrats of the JSP formed the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) with conservative-liberal Sakigake and other moderates of the LDP. Most of the DPJ&#x27;s mainstream factions moved to the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), but the former DPJ&#x27;s right-wing moved to the Democratic Party for the People after 2019.

=== United States ===
In recent years, the term &quot;political moderates&quot; has gained traction as a buzzword. Voters who describe themselves as centrist often mean that they are moderate in their political views, advocating neither extreme left-wing nor extreme right-wing politics. Gallup polling indicates that American voters identified as moderate between 35 and 38% of the time during the 1990s and 2000s. Voters may identify with moderation for a number of reasons: pragmatic, ideological, or otherwise; however, the number of people that vote for centrist political parties is a statistical anomaly, in part due to the entrenched nature of the country&#x27;s two-party system.

<text>Waite Charles Hoyt (September 9, 1899 – August 25, 1984) was an American right-handed professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball for seven different teams during 1918–1938. He was one of the dominant pitchers of the 1920s, and the most successful pitcher for the New York Yankees during that decade. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in .

==Early life==
Hoyt was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Addison and Louise Benedum Hoyt, and attended Erasmus Hall High School.

==Career==
===Baseball===
Despite being a Dodgers fan, Hoyt was signed to a professional contract by New York Giants manager John McGraw when he was but 15. Because of his extreme youth, he was immediately nicknamed &quot;the Schoolboy Wonder&quot;.

After a brief stint with the Giants, McGraw sent Hoyt to the minors for refinement and experience. Hoyt soon returned to the majors, this time with the Boston Red Sox. His performance there attracted the attention of the Yankees, who acquired him in 1920. In his first season as a Yankee, he won 19 games and pitched three complete games in the World Series without allowing an earned run – over his career, he would win six American League pennants with the Yankees and one with the Philadelphia Athletics. In his finest years with the Yankees, 1927 and 1928, Hoyt posted records of 22 wins and 7 losses with a 2.64 earned run average (ERA) and 23 wins and 7 losses with a 3.36 ERA. During his 21-year career, he won 10 or more games 12 times, 11 of them consecutively. 

In May 1930, the Yankees traded Hoyt and Mark Koenig to the Detroit Tigers for Ownie Carroll, Harry Rice, and Yats Wuestling. He pitched for eight years after leaving the Yankees in 1930, but did not consistently display similar levels of pitching dominance.

Hoyt finished his career with a win–loss record of 237–182 and an ERA of 3.59. By the time he retired in 1938, he had pitched the most victories in World Series history (his World Series record with the Yankees and A&#x27;s was 6–4).

As a hitter, Hoyt posted a .198 batting average (255-for-1287) with 96 runs, 100 RBI and 40 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .966 fielding percentage which was 9 points higher than the league average at his position.

Hoyt had a total of 36 Major League teammates who would later be elected to the Hall of Fame. , no other Hall of Famer has had more Hall of Fame teammates.

===Additional/concurrent careers===
In addition to the &quot;Schoolboy&quot; moniker appearing on his Hall of Fame plaque, Hoyt was also known as &quot;the Merry Mortician&quot;, for when he was not playing baseball, he spent days working as a funeral director and nights appearing in vaudeville. As a vaudevillian, he appeared with many of the most well-known performers of the day, including Jack Benny, Jimmy Durante, George Burns, and others. He kept in shape during the off-season by playing semi-professional basketball. 

He added to his repertoire by becoming an accomplished painter and writer, including two published  books: “Babe Ruth as I Knew Him” (Dell Publishing Company, 1948) and “Schoolboy: The Untold Journey of a Yankees Hero,” (University of Nebraska Press, 2024), a posthumous memoir, with co-author Tim Manners and foreword by Bob Costas. 

===Broadcasting===
After retiring as a player, Hoyt went into radio broadcasting. He was heard on WMCA in New York City but left that station to begin &quot;a nightly quarter-hour program&quot; of sports news and commentary on WNEW in New York, beginning October 17, 1938.

During a stint as the host of &quot;Grandstand and Bandstand&quot; on WMCA, he tried to audition for the Yankees, but sponsor Wheaties vetoed him out of hand. The common view at the time was that former players did not possess enough education or vocabulary to be successful broadcasters. However, Hoyt was well known for dressing down umpire George Moriarty when he missed a call by saying, &quot;You&#x27;re out of your element. You should be a traffic cop so you could stand in the middle of the street with a badge on your chest and insult people with impunity!&quot;

Dodgers voice Red Barber, however, thought more of Hoyt&#x27;s abilities and hired him to host the team&#x27;s post-game shows on WOR in 1940. Two years later, Hoyt became the play-by-play voice of the Cincinnati Reds, a post he held for 24 seasons. He became as much a celebrity with the Reds as he was while a player. He was well known for calling games exclusively in past tense, which was and still is unusual for sportscasting. Whereas most baseball announcers would say, &quot;Here&#x27;s the pitch!&quot; Hoyt would say, &quot;There was the pitch!&quot; He told author Curt Smith that he felt using past tense was more accurate, because &quot;as I speak to you, what happened a moment ago is gone.&quot;

On the evening of August 16, 1948, the Reds played the Pittsburgh Pirates. During the game, Hoyt learned that his friend Babe Ruth had died. After the game, speaking without notes, Hoyt paid tribute to Ruth on the air for two hours. He was well known as the pre-eminent authority on Ruth; they were teammates from 1921 to 1930, and Ruth long counted Hoyt among his small inner circle of friends. Robert Creamer, author of the definitive Ruth biography &quot;Babe&quot;, indicated in that book&#x27;s introduction that the novella-length memoir written by Hoyt shortly after Ruth&#x27;s death was &quot;by far the most revealing and rewarding work on Ruth.&quot;

Nationally, Hoyt shared radio play-by-play duties for the 1953 All-Star Game on the Mutual network and the second 1960 All-Star Game on NBC Radio. He also called the 1961 World Series on NBC Radio, in an era when it was common for the principal broadcasters for the participating teams to be utilized in the network broadcasts of the Fall Classic. As it happened, 1961 was the Reds&#x27; only World Series appearance during Hoyt&#x27;s tenure in their booth. In fact, the team only finished in the first division seven other times during his tenure, leading Hoyt to call himself &quot;a bad news broadcaster.&quot;

Hoyt became known for entertaining radio audiences during rain delays, sharing anecdotes and telling vivid stories from his days as a player; a selection of these stories is collected on two record albums: &quot;The Best of Waite Hoyt in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Waite Hoyt Talks Babe Ruth&quot;. Hoyt was one of the first professional athletes to develop a successful career in broadcasting and his name frequently appears on &quot;all-time best&quot; broadcaster lists.

He retired from full-time broadcasting work in 1965, though he later made appearances on both radio and television, including the color commentary for the Reds telecasts in 1972. On June 10, 2007, the Reds honored Hoyt, Marty Brennaman, and Joe Nuxhall with replica microphones that are hung below the radio broadcast booth at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati.

==Honors and legacy==

Hoyt was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by its Veterans Committee in 1969.

The Cincinnati chapter of the Society of American Baseball Research is named in honor of Hoyt.

==Personal life==
Hoyt married Dorothy Pyle in 1922. The couple was divorced ten years later. He then married Ellen Burbank. She died on November 23, 1982. 

He last married Betty Derie on March 5, 1983. Derie, a longtime fan, was an associate of Warren Giles, first President of the Reds and subsequently of the National League. Betty lived in Cincinnati until her death on December 25, 2015, and was interviewed extensively in the video biography &quot;Waite&#x27;s World&quot; written and directed by Donn Burrows. The video bio was released on VHS in 1997 and includes interviews with his son Chris, the late Hall of Fame broadcaster Joe Nuxhall, reporter and television personality Nick Clooney, and retired Reds pitcher Jim O&#x27;Toole. It is available to view with a simple Google search of &quot;Waite&#x27;s World Video&quot; 

A longtime member of Alcoholics Anonymous, during the 1978 Old-Timers&#x27; Day game, Hoyt said wistfully that he would have won 300 games if he had stopped drinking during his playing days. After joining AA, he remained sober for more than 40 years.

Hoyt died of heart failure while preparing for what he realized would be his final visit to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. He is interred in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.

<doc id="650426" wikidata="Q186327" url="?curid=650426" title="Marilyn Manson">
<text>Brian Hugh Warner (born January 5, 1969), known professionally as Marilyn Manson, is an American rock musician. He is the lead singer and only constant member of the same-titled band he formed in 1989. The band members initially created their stage names by combining the first name of an American female sex symbol with the last name of a male serial killer. The singer derived his name from the actress Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. 

In the 1990s, the band released the albums &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; (1994), &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; (1996) and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; (1998), which included hit singles such as &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, &quot;The Dope Show&quot; and &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; is a direct response to mainstream media, who falsely blamed Manson for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre. He is widely considered one of the most controversial figures in heavy metal. In addition to the Columbine tragedy, his lyrics have been criticized by American politicians and examined in congressional hearings, with several U.S. states creating legislation specifically banning the group from performing in state-operated venues. His paintings and films appeared as evidence in a murder trial, and he has been accused of inspiring several other murders and school shootings.

In the U.S. alone, three of the band&#x27;s albums have been awarded platinum status and three more went gold, and the band has had eight releases debut in the top 10, including two No. 1 albums. Manson has been ranked at No. 44 on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists&quot; by &quot;Hit Parader&quot; and, along with his band, has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, with Manson earning an additional Grammy nomination for his work on Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Donda&quot; (2021). Manson made his film debut as an actor in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997), and has since appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos. In 2002, his first art show, &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot;, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions center.

In 2021, former partner Evan Rachel Wood accused Manson of psychological and sexual abuse, allegations he denied. Other women followed with similar accusations, with five women suing him in civil court. One of these lawsuits was withdrawn after the accuser recanted her allegations and said Wood pressured her to make false accusations against Manson. He sued Wood for defamation, but later dropped the lawsuit after substantial portions of the suit were dismissed by Wood&#x27;s anti-SLAPP motions. He agreed to pay her legal fees. A four-year criminal investigation of the abuse allegations by the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department concluded in 2025, which resulted in no charges filed against Manson due to lack of evidence.

== Early life ==
Brian Hugh Warner was born in Canton, Ohio, on January 5, 1969, the son of Barbara J. Wyer (died 2014) and Hugh Angus Warner (died 2017). He is of English, German, Irish, and Polish descent, and has also said that his mother&#x27;s family (who hailed from the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia) had Sioux heritage.

As a child, he attended his mother&#x27;s Episcopal church, though his father was a Catholic. He attended Heritage Christian School from first to tenth grade. In that school, his instructors tried to show children what music they were not supposed to listen to; he thus fell in love with what he &quot;wasn&#x27;t supposed to&quot;. He later transferred to GlenOak High School and graduated in 1987.

After relocating with his parents, he enrolled at Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1990. He was working toward a degree in journalism, gaining experience in the field by writing articles for the music magazine &quot;25th Parallel&quot;. He also interviewed musicians and soon met several of the musicians to whom his own work was later compared, including Groovie Mann from My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. The latter became his mentor and produced his debut album.

== Career ==
=== Music ===

The band was formed in 1989 by Warner and guitarist Scott Putesky, with Warner writing lyrics and Putesky composing the majority of music. Warner adopted the stage name Marilyn Manson and, alongside a revolving lineup of musicians, recorded the band&#x27;s first demo tape as Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids in 1990. The group quickly developed a loyal fanbase within the South Florida punk and hardcore music scene, primarily as a result of their intentionally shocking concerts; band members often performed in women&#x27;s clothing or bizarre costumes, and live shows routinely featured amateur pyrotechnics, naked women nailed to crucifixes, children locked in cages, as well as experiments in reverse psychology and butchered animals remains. Within six months of forming, they were playing sold-out shows in 300-capacity nightclubs throughout Florida. They signed a record deal with Sony Music in early 1991, although this deal was rescinded before any material was recorded for the label. The band instead used the proceeds of this deal to fund the recording of subsequent demo tapes, which were released independently.
The name of the group was shortened to Marilyn Manson in 1992, and they continued to perform and release cassettes until the summer of 1993, when Reznor signed the act to his vanity label Nothing Records. Their debut studio album, &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;, was released in July 1994. Manson later criticized Nothing Records and its parent label Interscope for a perceived lack of promotion. While recording b-sides and remixes for the album&#x27;s proposed third single, &quot;Dope Hat&quot;, the band decided to issue the resultant material as a standalone release titled &quot;Smells Like Children&quot;. The record included their cover version of the Eurythmics&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, which established the band as a mainstream act. The song&#x27;s music video was placed on heavy rotation on MTV, and earned the band their first nomination for Best Rock Video at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards. Their second studio album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, sparked a fierce backlash among Christian fundamentalists. The album was an immediate commercial success, debuting at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling almost 2 million copies in the United States alone, and 7 million copies worldwide. Lead single &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; received three nominations at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, where the band also performed.

For 1998&#x27;s &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, Manson said he took inspiration from 1970s glam rock, and adopted a wardrobe and hairstyle similar to David Bowie. He said he did this to avoid being portrayed as a &quot;bogeyman&quot;, a role which had been ascribed to him by mainstream media following the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough. Interscope&#x27;s promotion of the album was massive, with the label erecting enormous billboards of Manson as an androgynous extraterrestrial in Times Square and the Sunset Strip. Lead single &quot;The Dope Show&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but was the lowest-selling number-one album of 1998 in the United States, with sales of 1.4 million copies in the country as of 2017. The album was not well received by longtime fans, who complained about its radio-friendly sound and accused the vocalist of &quot;selling out&quot;, and Interscope were reportedly disappointed with its commercial performance.

&quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; was a return to the band&#x27;s industrial metal roots after the glam-influenced &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, and was the vocalist&#x27;s response to media coverage blaming him for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre. The album was a critical success, with numerous publications praising it as the band&#x27;s finest work. Despite being certified gold in the United States for shipments in excess of half a million units, mainstream media openly questioned the band&#x27;s commercial appeal, noting the dominance of nu metal and controversial hip hop artists such as Eminem. A cover of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; was an international hit in 2002, peaking at number one in several territories.

&quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; was released the following year, an album primarily inspired by the swing and burlesque movements of 1920s Berlin. In an extended metaphor found throughout the record, Manson compared his own often-criticized work to the &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; banned by the Nazi regime. Like &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; in 1998, &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but was the lowest-selling studio album to debut at number one that year, selling 527,000 copies in the United States as of 2008. The album was more successful in Europe, where it sold over 400,000 on its first week of release to debut at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s European Top 100 Albums. Manson began his collaboration with French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier during this period, who designed much of the elaborate attire worn by the band on the supporting &quot;Grotesk Burlesk Tour&quot;. The greatest hits compilation &quot;Lest We Forget: The Best Of&quot; was released in 2004.

After a three-year hiatus, in which the vocalist pursued other interests, the band returned with 2007&#x27;s &quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrical content largely related to the dissolution of Manson&#x27;s marriage to Dita Von Teese and his affair with 19-year-old actress Evan Rachel Wood. Seventh studio album &quot;The High End of Low&quot; was released in 2009, and was their final album issued by Interscope. While promoting the record, Manson made a series of disparaging comments about the label and its artistic censorship, as well as its president Jimmy Iovine. Manson signed a lucrative recording contract with British independent record label Cooking Vinyl in 2011, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recouped costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution. The first album released under the deal was 2012&#x27;s &quot;Born Villain&quot;. Lead single &quot;No Reflection&quot; earned the band their fourth Grammy nomination. Subsequent albums were released in the United States by Loma Vista Recordings, beginning with 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Pale Emperor&quot;, which was widely seen as a return to form and was a commercial success upon release.

&quot;Heaven Upside Down&quot; followed in 2017, with its single &quot;Kill4Me&quot; becoming the band&#x27;s highest-peaking single ever on &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock. While touring in support of the record, Manson was injured by two large falling stage props as he performed on stage at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, breaking his fibula in two places, requiring a plate and ten screws to be inserted in the bone, as well as another screw in his ankle, which he had sprained during a show in Pittsburgh. &quot;God&#x27;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot; was released as a non-album single in 2019, and is the band&#x27;s highest-peaking single on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rock Songs and Rock Digital Songs. Their most recent studio album, 2020&#x27;s &quot;We Are Chaos&quot;, was the band&#x27;s tenth top ten release on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Manson announced in March 2024 that the band would embark on an arena and amphitheater tour of North America with Five Finger Death Punch. The tour began on August 2, and was interspersed with Manson&#x27;s own headlining shows. The same day that the tour began, the band released &quot;As Sick as the Secrets Within&quot;, their first new single in four years. This was followed two weeks later by &quot;Raise the Red Flag&quot;. Music videos were released for both songs, each directed by Bill Yukich. The band will perform their own headline shows in Europe in 2025.

According to Nielsen SoundScan, the band sold 8.7 million albums alone in the United States as of 2011. Three of their albums received platinum awards from the Recording Industry Association of America, and a further three received gold certifications. Ten of their releases debuted in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, including two number-one albums. In the United Kingdom, the band are certified for sales of almost 1.75 million units. Marilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records worldwide.

===Musical collaborations===
In addition to his work with the band, Manson has collaborated extensively with other musicians. Cello rock act Rasputina opened for the band throughout the &quot;Dead to the World Tour&quot;, the controversial tour supporting &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. Lead vocalist Melora Creager performed cello and backing vocals for the band, most notably for renditions of &quot;Apple of Sodom&quot;, a live version of which appeared as a b-side on Manson&#x27;s 1998 single &quot;The Dope Show&quot;. Manson also created three remixes of the song &quot;Transylvanian Concubine&quot;, two of which appeared on their 1997 EP &quot;Transylvanian Regurgitations&quot;. Manson befriended the Smashing Pumpkins vocalist Billy Corgan in 1997, and performed renditions of &quot;Eye&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; alongside that band at the 1997 edition of Bridge School Benefit concert. Manson frequently consulted Corgan during the early stages of recording &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;. Referring to its inclusion of glam rock influences, Corgan advised Manson that &quot;This is definitely the right direction&quot; but to &quot;go all the way with it. Don&#x27;t just hint at it&quot;. In 2015, Marilyn Manson and the Smashing Pumpkins embarked on a co-headlining tour titled &quot;The End Times Tour&quot;.

To promote &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; in 1998, the band embarked on their first co-headlining concert tour: the &quot;Beautiful Monsters Tour&quot; with Hole. The tour was problematic, with Manson and Hole vocalist Courtney Love frequently insulting one another both on-stage and during interviews. Private disputes also arose over finances, as Hole were unwittingly financing most of Manson&#x27;s production costs, which were disproportionately high relative to Hole&#x27;s. The tour was to consist of thirty-seven dates, although Hole left after nine. When Hole departed from the tour, it was renamed the &quot;Rock Is Dead Tour&quot;, with Jack Off Jill announced as one of the support acts. Manson had produced many of Jack Off Jill&#x27;s demo recordings in the early 90s, and later wrote the liner notes to their 2006 compilation &quot;Humid Teenage Mediocrity 1992–1996&quot;.

Manson launched his own vanity label in 2000, Posthuman Records. The label released two albums – the 2000 soundtrack to &quot;Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2&quot; and Godhead&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;2000 Years of Human Error&quot; – before being dissolved in 2003. The latter album sold over 100,000 copies in the United States, and featured him performing vocals on the track &quot;Break You Down&quot;. He performed vocals on &quot;Redeemer&quot;, a song written by Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis that featured on the 2002 album &quot;Queen of the Damned: Music from the Motion Picture&quot;. Davis had been prevented from singing the song due to contractual issues with his record label. Manson also contributed a remix of the Linkin Park song &quot;By Myself&quot; to that band&#x27;s remix album &quot;Reanimation&quot;, and collaborated with Marco Beltrami to create the score for the 2002 film &quot;Resident Evil&quot;.

He performed vocals on the Chew Fu GhettoHouse Fix remix of Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;LoveGame&quot;, which was featured as a b-side on the song&#x27;s single in 2008. He was a featured vocalist on &quot;Can&#x27;t Haunt Me&quot;, a track recorded in 2011 for Skylar Grey&#x27;s unreleased album &quot;Invinsible&quot;. He appeared on &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, a song from Avril Lavigne&#x27;s 2013 self-titled album, and featured on the song &quot;Hypothetical&quot; from Emigrate&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Silent So Long&quot;. New Orleans brass ensemble the Soul Rebels performed &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; alongside Manson at the 2015 edition of the Japanese Summer Sonic Festival. Manson recorded vocals on a cover of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot; for country musician Shooter Jennings&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Countach (For Giorgio)&quot;. The two were introduced in 2013 by Manson&#x27;s then-bassist Twiggy Ramirez, and the pair first collaborated that same year on a song for the soundtrack to television series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;. Their version of the song, &quot;Join the Human Gang&quot;, remains unreleased, but the track was eventually rewritten and released by The White Buffalo as &quot;Come Join the Murder&quot;. Jennings later produced Manson&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;We Are Chaos&quot;.

Manson has collaborated with numerous hip hop artists. In 1998, he featured on &quot;The Omen (Damien II)&quot;, a track on DMX&#x27;s album &quot;Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood&quot;. Following the Columbine High School massacre, Manson was mentioned in the lyrics to Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Way I Am&quot; from &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, in the lyric &quot;When a dude&#x27;s getting bullied and he shoots up the school and they blame it on Marilyn&quot;. Manson appeared in the song&#x27;s music video, and a remix created by Danny Lohner and featuring Manson appeared on special editions of &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;. Manson also joined Eminem on-stage for several live performances of the track, one of which featured on Eminem&#x27;s 2002 video album &quot;All Access Europe&quot;. He featured on &quot;Pussy Wet&quot;, a song on Gucci Mane&#x27;s 2013 mixtape &quot;Diary of a Trap God&quot;, and provided vocals on the song &quot;Marilyn Manson&quot; on the 2020 mixtape &quot;Floor Seats II&quot; by ASAP Ferg.

Alongside DaBaby, Manson co-wrote and was a featured artist on &quot;Jail pt 2&quot;, a song on Kanye West&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;Donda&quot;. Manson and DaBaby appeared alongside West - aka Ye - at several events promoting the album, including at a listening event held at Soldier Field in August, and at one of Ye&#x27;s Sunday Church Services in October. The appearances attracted significant media attention and controversy. Ye said the trio collaborated on a total of five songs. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, which entitled Manson to a co-nomination credit for his work on the song. Manson continued his collaboration with Ye for the follow-up album, &quot;Donda 2&quot;. Ye collaborator Digital Nas said Manson was in the recording studio &quot;every day&quot; while the album was recorded, and explained that Ye &quot;doesn&#x27;t want Marilyn to play rap beats. He wants Marilyn to play what he makes, and then Ye will take parts of that and sample parts of that and use parts of that, like he did [generally when making] &quot;Yeezus&quot;.&quot; Manson band-member Tim Skold has confirmed he was involved in the process.

While with the Spooky Kids, Manson teamed with Jeordie White (also known as Twiggy Ramirez) and Stephen Gregory Bier Jr. (also known as Madonna Wayne Gacy) in two side-projects: Satan on Fire, a faux-Christian metal ensemble where he played bass guitar, and drums in Mrs. Scabtree, a collaborative band formed with White and then girlfriend Jessicka (vocalist with the band Jack Off Jill) as a way to combat contractual agreements that prohibited Marilyn Manson from playing in certain clubs.

=== Film and television ===
Manson made his film debut in 1997, as an actor in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. Since then he has appeared in many minor roles and cameos, including &quot;Party Monster&quot;; then-girlfriend Rose McGowan&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;; Asia Argento&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot;; &quot;&quot;; &quot;The Hire: Beat The Devil&quot;, the sixth installment in the BMW films series; and Showtime&#x27;s comedy-drama TV series &quot;Californication&quot; in 2013, in which Manson portrayed himself. He also appeared on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;, of which Manson is reportedly a longtime fan, and had lobbied to appear on for years; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, for which he provided the voice of the character &quot;Shadow&quot;.

He was interviewed in Michael Moore&#x27;s political documentary &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; (2002) discussing possible motivations for the Columbine massacre and allegations that his music was somehow a factor. He has appeared in animated form in &quot;Clone High&quot; and participated in several episodes of the MTV series &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;, becoming the show&#x27;s unofficial champion and mascot; he often performed the voice for his claymated puppet, and contributed the song &quot;Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes&quot; to the soundtrack album. In July 2005, Manson told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he was shifting his focus from music to filmmaking – &quot;I just don&#x27;t think the world is worth putting music into right now. I no longer want to make art that other people – particularly record companies – are turning into a product. I just want to make art.&quot; Johnny Depp reportedly used Manson as his inspiration for his performance as Willy Wonka in the film &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.
He had been working on his directorial debut, &quot;Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll&quot;, a project that has been in development hell since 2004, with Manson also set to portray the role of Lewis Carroll, author of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Initially announced as a web-only release, it was later decided to give the estimated $4.2 million budget film a conventional cinema release, with a slated release date of mid-2007. The film was to have an original music soundtrack with previously unreleased songs. Production of the film had been postponed indefinitely until after the &quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot; tour. In 2010, studio bosses shut down production on the project, reportedly due to viewers&#x27; responses to the violent content of clips released on the internet. The film was later officially put on &quot;indefinite production hold&quot;.

According to a 2010 interview with cowriter Anthony Silva about the hold, the film was still on and the talk of it being shut down was just a myth.
In a June 2013 interview, Manson stated that he had &quot;resurrected&quot; the project, and that Roger Avary would direct it. In a separate interview during the previous year, he said a small crew similar to what he used for his &quot;Slo-Mo-Tion&quot; music video would be used, and would rather film the movie on an iPhone than not film it at all. In a Reddit AMA with Billy Corgan on April 4, 2015, Manson commented that he had withdrawn from the project because the writing process for the film was &quot;so... damaging to my psyche, I&#x27;ve decided I don&#x27;t want to have anything to do with it&quot;, and further commented that the only footage that had been created thus far had been content created for the trailer, which was made to promote the film.

Manson appeared in the final season of the TV series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, portraying white supremacist Ron Tully. In January 2016, it was announced that Manson would be joining the cast for season 3 of WGN&#x27;s &quot;Salem&quot;. He played Thomas Dinley, a barber and surgeon described as &quot;the go-to man in Salem, from a shave and a haircut to being leeched, bled, sliced open or sewn up&quot;. In 2020, Manson was a guest star on the HBO television series &quot;The New Pope&quot;, in which he has a personal audience with the series&#x27; Pope and recommends that he visit the prior Pope that lies unconscious in a coma.

=== Art ===

Manson stated in a 2004 interview with &quot;i-D magazine&quot; to have begun his career as a watercolor painter in 1999 when he made five-minute concept pieces and sold them to drug dealers. On September 13–14, 2002, his first show, The Golden Age of Grotesque, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Centre. &quot;Art in America&quot;″s Max Henry likened them to the works of a &quot;psychiatric patient given materials to use as therapy&quot; and said his work would never be taken seriously in a fine art context, writing that the value was &quot;in their celebrity, not the work&quot;. On September 14–15, 2004, Manson held a second exhibition on the first night in Paris and the second in Berlin. The show was named &#x27;Trismegistus&#x27; which was also the title of the center piece of the exhibit – a large, three-headed Christ painted onto an antique wood panel from a portable embalmers table.

Manson named his self-proclaimed art movement Celebritarian Corporation. He has coined a slogan for the movement: &quot;We will sell our shadow to those who stand within it.&quot; In 2005 he said that the Celebritarian Corporation has been &quot;incubating for seven years&quot; which if correct would indicate that Celebritarian Corporation, in some form, started in 1998. Celebritarian Corporation is also the namesake of an art gallery owned by Manson, called the &quot;Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art&quot; in Los Angeles for which his third exhibition was the inaugural show. From April 2–17, 2007, his works were on show at the Space 39 Modern &amp; Contemporary art gallery in Fort Myers, Florida. Forty pieces from this show traveled to Germany&#x27;s Gallery Brigitte Schenk in Cologne to be publicly exhibited from June 28 – July 28, 2007. Manson revealed a series of 20 paintings in 2010 entitled &quot;Genealogies of Pain&quot;, an exhibition showcased at Vienna&#x27;s Kunsthalle gallery which the artist collaborated on with David Lynch.

=== Video games ===

Manson has made an appearance in the video game &quot;Area 51&quot; as Edgar, a grey alien. His song &quot;Cruci-Fiction in Space&quot; is featured in a commercial for the video game, &quot;The Darkness&quot;. His likeness is also featured on the &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; video game for which he recorded a song for the soundtrack (2003). The song &quot;Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth&quot; was the credits score of the game &quot;Cold Fear&quot; as well as &quot;&quot;. The song &quot;Four Rusted Horses&quot; had an alternate version used in trailers for the video game &quot;Fear 3&quot;. A remix of the song &quot;Tainted Love&quot; appears in the debut trailer for the 2010 video game, &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot; and in the launch trailer of the 2012 video game &quot;Twisted Metal&quot;. Manson&#x27;s song &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; was featured in &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;, &quot;KickBeat&quot; and &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;. The song &quot;Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon&quot; is also featured in &quot;Saints Row: The Third&quot;. His music video to the song &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; was used in some parts of the &quot;Buzz!&quot; game series.

===Hell, etc.===
Hell, etc. was Manson&#x27;s third art exhibition, held in Athens, Greece. The exhibition was open to the public from April 28, 2010, until May 2, 2010. Manson&#x27;s more recent artworks and newly revealed pieces at the time, were displayed. The art exhibition was scheduled to run until April 25, 2010, however due to a volcanic ash cloud, it was postponed to run from April 28, 2010, until May 2, 2010. The exhibition was held at the Athenian Cultural Centre. The exhibition opened at 10:00 daily and was open until 22:00. Flash photography was prohibited inside the exhibition, as the watercolor paintings were extremely sensitive to the flash.

=== Other ventures ===
Manson launched &quot;Mansinthe&quot;, his own brand of Swiss-made absinthe, which has received mixed reviews; some critics described the taste as being &quot;just plain&quot;, but it came second to Versinthe in an Absinthe top five and won a gold medal at the 2008 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Other reviewers, such as critics at The Wormwood Society, have given the absinthe moderately high praise. In 2015, Manson stated he was no longer drinking absinthe.

== Vocal style ==

Manson predominantly delivers lyrics in a melodic fashion, although he invariably enhances his vocal register by using several extended vocal techniques, such as vocal fry, screaming, growling and crooning. In one interview he claimed his voice has five different tones, which mixing engineer Robert Carranza discovered can form a pentagram when imported into a phrasal analyzer. He possesses a baritone vocal type, and has a vocal range which spans three octaves. His lowest bass note of A1 can be heard in &quot;Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon&quot;, while his highest note, an E6 – the first note of the whistle register — can be heard on the &quot;Born Villain&quot; song &quot;Hey, Cruel World...&quot;.

==Appearance==
Manson often appears wearing one or two coloured contact lenses as well as a distinctive and ever-changing androgynous wardrobe and makeup.

== Name ==
The name Marilyn Manson is formed by a juxtaposition of two opposing American pop cultural icons: Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. Monroe, an actress, was one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and continues to be a major icon over 50 years after, while Manson, a cult leader, was responsible for the murder of actress Sharon Tate, as well as several others; and served a life sentence on murder and conspiracy charges until his death in 2017.
Manson has mentioned on at least two occasions that he trademarked the name Marilyn Manson. In an interview at the 2015 Cannes Lions Festival, he said: &quot;I trademarked the name &#x27;Marilyn Manson&#x27; the same way as Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse. It&#x27;s not a stage name. It&#x27;s not my legal name. ... Marilyn Manson is owned by Brian Warner, my real name.&quot; He also mentioned this in a 2013 interview with Larry King. The records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office show that he registered four trademarks of the name between 1994 and 1999, protecting entertainment services, merchandising and branding.

Manson says he used those trademark registrations to issue cease and desist orders to media outlets who wrongly blamed him for the Columbine High School massacre. One journalist had erroneously reported the shooters were &quot;wearing Marilyn Manson makeup and t-shirts&quot;, although the reports were soon proved incorrect. He said &quot;Once the wheels started spinning, Fox News started going.&quot; As a result of these accusations, Manson&#x27;s career was seriously harmed. He was shunned by many venue owners and received numerous death threats.

Manson generally uses the name in lieu of his birth name. Though his mother referred to him by his birth name of Brian, his father opted to refer to his son as simply &quot;Manson&quot; since about 1993, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s called respect of the artist.&quot;

== Lawsuits ==
In September 1996, former bassist Gidget Gein negotiated a settlement with Manson where he would receive and 20 percent of any royalties paid for recordings and for any songs he had a hand in writing and his share of any other royalties or fees the group earned while he was a member and he could market himself as a former member of Marilyn Manson. This settlement was not honored.

Former guitarist and founding member Scott Putesky (a.k.a. Daisy Berkowitz) filed a $15 million lawsuit in a Fort Lauderdale court against the singer, the band and the band&#x27;s attorney (David Codikow) in January 1998 after his departure from the group in the spring of 1996. Berkowitz claimed &quot;thousands of dollars in royalties, publishing rights, and performance fees&quot; and filed an attorney malpractice suit against Codikow, alleging that &quot;Codikow represented Warner&#x27;s interests more than the band&#x27;s and ... gave Warner disproportionate control&quot;. By October of that year, the suit had been settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

On November 30, 1998, a few days after the band accumulated &quot;[a] total [of] more than $25,000&quot; in backstage and hotel room damages during the Poughkeepsie, New York, stop of their Mechanical Animals Tour, &quot;SPIN&quot; editor Craig Marks filed a $24-million lawsuit against Manson and his bodyguards. On February 19, 1999, Manson counter-sued Marks for libel, slander and defamation, seeking in reparation. Marks later dropped the lawsuit. Manson apologized for the Poughkeepsie incident and offered to make financial restitution.

In a civil battery suit, David Diaz, a security officer from a concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on October 27, 2000, sued for in a Minneapolis federal court. The federal court jury found in Manson&#x27;s favor. In a civil suit presented by Oakland County, Michigan, Manson was charged with sexual misconduct against another security officer, Joshua Keasler, during a concert in Clarkston, Michigan, on July 30, 2001. Oakland County originally filed assault and battery and criminal sexual misconduct charges, but the judge reduced the latter charge to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Manson pleaded no contest to the reduced charges, paid a fine, and later settled the lawsuit under undisclosed terms.

On April 3, 2002, Maria St. John filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court accusing Manson of providing her adult daughter, Jennifer Syme, with cocaine and instructing her to drive while under the influence. After attending a party at Manson&#x27;s house, Syme was given a lift home; Manson claims she was taken home by a designated driver. After she got home, she got behind the wheel of her own vehicle and was killed when she crashed it into three parked cars. Manson is reported to have said there were no alcohol or other drugs at the party; St. John&#x27;s lawyer disputed this claim.

On August 2, 2007, former band member Stephen Bier filed a lawsuit against Manson for unpaid &quot;partnership proceeds&quot;, seeking $20 million in back pay. Several details from the lawsuit leaked to the press. In December 2007, Manson countersued, claiming that Bier failed to fulfill his duties as a band member to play for recordings and to promote the band. On December 28, 2009, the suit was settled with an agreement which saw Bier&#x27;s attorneys being paid a total of $380,000.

==Philanthropy==
Manson has supported various charitable causes throughout his career. In 2002, he worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to collaborate with a fan who had been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. 16-year-old Andrew Baines from Tennessee was invited into the band&#x27;s recording studio to record backing vocals for their then-upcoming album, &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot;. His website read: &quot;Yesterday, I spent the afternoon with Andrew, who reminded me the things I create are only made complete by those who enjoy them. I just want to simply say, thank you to Andrew for sharing such an important wish with me.&quot; He contributed to Oxfam&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Rumble in the Jumble&quot; event, which raised money to aid victims of domestic and sexual abuse in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He has supported various organizations – such as Music for Life and Little Kids Rock – which enable access to musical instruments and education to children of low-income families. He has also worked with Project Nightlight, a group that encourages children and teenagers to speak out against physical and sexual abuse. In 2019, he performed alongside Cyndi Lauper at her annual &#x27;Home for the Holidays&#x27; benefit concert, with all proceeds donated to Lauper&#x27;s True Colors United, which &quot;works to develop solutions to youth homelessness that focus on the unique experiences of LGBTQ young people&quot;.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships ===
Manson was engaged to actress Rose McGowan from February 1999 to January 2001. McGowan later ended their engagement, citing &quot;lifestyle differences&quot;.

Manson and burlesque dancer, model, and costume designer Dita Von Teese became a couple in 2001. He proposed on March 22, 2004, and they were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony officiated by Chilean film director Alejandro Jodorowsky. On December 30, 2006, Von Teese filed for divorce due to &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. Von Teese also eventually stated she did not agree with Manson&#x27;s &quot;partying or his relationship with another girl&quot;. Manson&#x27;s &quot;heavy boozing&quot; and distant behavior were also cited as cause for the split. A judgment of divorce was entered in Los Angeles Superior Court on December 27, 2007.

Manson&#x27;s relationship with actress, model, and musician Evan Rachel Wood was made public in 2007. They maintained an on-again, off-again relationship for several years. He proposed to Wood during a Paris stage performance in January 2010, but the couple broke off the engagement later that year.

In the March 2012 issue of &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine, American photographer Lindsay Usich was referred to as Manson&#x27;s girlfriend. The article referenced a new painting by him featuring her. Usich is credited as the photo source for the cover art of Manson&#x27;s 2012 album, &quot;Born Villain&quot;. It was later confirmed that the two were romantically involved. In February 2015, Manson told &quot;Beat&quot; magazine that he is &quot;newly single&quot;.

In October 2020, Manson revealed in an interview with Nicolas Cage on ABC News Radio that he was married in a private ceremony during the COVID-19 pandemic. The person he married was revealed to be Usich after she changed her social media name to &quot;Lindsay Elizabeth Warner&quot;.

Manson is the godfather of Lily-Rose Depp.

=== Beliefs ===
Manson claims he was a friend of Anton LaVey, and early on had also claimed LaVey inducted him as a minister in the Church of Satan. Later in his career, Manson downplayed this, saying he was &quot;not necessarily&quot; a minister: &quot;that was something earlier... it was a friend of mine who&#x27;s now dead, who was a philosopher that I thought I learned a lot from. And that was a title I was given, so a lot of people made a lot out of it. But it&#x27;s not a real job, I didn&#x27;t get paid for it.&quot; The Church of Satan itself later confirmed Manson was never ordained as a minister in their church, explaining &quot;he was given an honorary priesthood for his real world accomplishments at the time&quot;.

Manson has been described as &quot;the highest profile Satanist ever&quot; with strong anti-Christian views and social Darwinist leanings.

Manson is also familiar with the writings of Aleister Crowley and Friedrich Nietzsche. He quotes Crowley throughout his autobiography, including Thelema&#x27;s principal dictum: &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot; Crowley&#x27;s esoteric subject matter forms an important theme in much of Manson&#x27;s early work.

==Controversies==
Marilyn Manson has been referred to as one of the most iconic and controversial figures in heavy metal music, with some referring to him as a &quot;pop culture icon&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine said there were &quot;few artists in the 90s as shocking as Marilyn Manson, the most famous of the shock-rockers&quot;. In her book &quot;Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture&quot;, author Jacqueline Edmondson writes that Manson creates music that &quot;challenges people&#x27;s worldviews and provokes questions and further thinking&quot;. Manson, his work, and the work of his eponymous band, have been involved in numerous controversies throughout their career.

On May 30, 1996, the co-directors of political advocacy group Empower America organized a bipartisan press conference with Republican William Bennett and Democrats Joseph Lieberman and C. Delores Tucker, in which the record industry was admonished for selling &quot;prepackaged, shrink-wrapped nihilism&quot;. The three largely targeted rap music, but also referenced Manson; Tucker called &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; the &quot;dirtiest, nastiest porno record directed at children that has ever hit the market&quot; and said distributing record labels had &quot;the blood of children on their hands&quot;, while Lieberman said the music &quot;celebrates some of the most antisocial and immoral behaviors imaginable&quot;. They also announced that Empower America would be launching a $25,000 radio advertising campaign to collect petitions from listeners who wanted record companies to &quot;stop spreading this vicious, vulgar music&quot;.

The release of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; in 1996 coincided with the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, and much of the attention received by Manson from mainstream media was not positive. Empower America organized another press conference in December 1996, where they criticized MCA—the owner of Interscope—president Edgar Bronfman Jr. for profiting from &quot;profanity-laced&quot; albums by Manson, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. The band&#x27;s live performances also came under fire during this period; the &quot;Dead to the World Tour&quot; was followed by protesters at nearly every North American venue it visited. Opponents of the band claimed the shows featured elements of Satanism, including a satanic altar, bestiality, rape, the distribution of free drugs, homosexual acts, as well as animal and even human sacrifices. Anonymous affidavits compiled by the Gulf Coast division of the American Family Association made various other claims about the live shows. Students in Florida were threatened with expulsion for attending the band&#x27;s concerts.

Several state legislatures, including the Utah State Legislature, South Carolina Legislature and the Virginia General Assembly, enacted legislation specifically targeting the group, banning them from performing at state-operated venues. These laws would later be repealed, following separate lawsuits from fans and the American Civil Liberties Union. Ozzy Osbourne sued the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority after they forced the cancelation of the New Jersey date of the 1997 Ozzfest at Giants Stadium; Manson&#x27;s appearance had been cited as the reason for the cancelation. In November 1997, Manson&#x27;s lyrical content was examined during congressional hearings led by Lieberman and Sam Brownback, in an attempt to determine the effects—if any—of violent lyrics on young listeners. The subcommittee heard testimony from Raymond Kuntz, who blamed his son&#x27;s suicide on &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;—specifically the song &quot;The Reflecting God&quot;. Lieberman went on to claim that the band&#x27;s music was driving young listeners to commit suicide, and called the band the &quot;sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company&quot;.

===Columbine High School shooting===

On April 20, 1999, Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed thirteen people and wounded twenty-four others before committing suicide. In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, media reports surfaced that were heavily critical of Goth subculture, alleging the perpetrators were wearing Marilyn Manson T-shirts during the massacre, and that they were influenced by violence in entertainment, specifically movies, video games and music. Five days after the incident, William Bennet and Joseph Lieberman – longtime critics of the vocalist – appeared on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, where they cited his music as a contributing factor to the shooting. Soon after, sensationalist headlines such as &quot;Killers Worshipped Rock Freak Manson&quot; and &quot;Devil-Worshipping Maniac Told Kids To Kill&quot; began appearing in media coverage of the tragedy. Despite confirmation that the pair were fans of German industrial bands such as KMFDM and Rammstein, and had &quot;nothing but contempt&quot; for Manson&#x27;s music, mainstream media continued to direct the majority of blame for the shooting at Manson.

The Mayor of Denver, Wellington Webb, successfully petitioned for the cancelation of KBPI-FM&#x27;s annual &quot;Birthday Bash&quot;, at which Manson was scheduled to appear on April 30. Webb said the concert would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; because the two gunmen were thought to be fans of Manson. Coloradoan politicians Bill Owens and Tom Tancredo accused Manson of promoting &quot;hate, violence, death, suicide, drug use and the attitudes and actions of the Columbine High School killers&quot;. On April 29, ten US senators led by Brownback sent a letter to the head of Seagram, the conglomerate which owned Manson&#x27;s record label, requesting they stop distributing music to children that &quot;glorifies violence&quot;. The letter named Manson, accusing him of producing songs that &quot;eerily reflect&quot; the actions of Harris and Klebold.

Manson canceled the final four dates of the Rock Is Dead Tour out of respect for the victims while criticizing the media for their irresponsible coverage of the tragedy. He elaborated on this point in an op-ed written for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; titled &quot;Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?&quot;. In the article, Manson castigated America&#x27;s gun culture and the political influence of the National Rifle Association, but was heavily critical of news media. He argued the media should be blamed for the next school shooting, as it was them who propagated the ensuing hysteria and &quot;witch hunt&quot;, and said that instead of debating more relevant societal issues, the media instead facilitated the placing of blame on a scapegoat.

On May 4, Brownback chaired a congressional hearing of the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on the distribution and marketing of supposedly violent content to children by the film, music, television and video-game industries. The committee heard testimony from Bennett, the Archbishop of Denver Charles J. Chaput, as well as professors and mental health professionals; they criticized Manson, his label mates Nine Inch Nails, and the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot; for their alleged contribution to a cultural environment enabling violence such as the Columbine shootings. Recording Industry Association of America executive Hilary Rosen said she refused to participate in the hearing as it was &quot;staged as political theater. They just wanted to find a way to shame the industry, and I&#x27;m not ashamed.&quot; The committee eventually requested the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry&#x27;s marketing practices to minors. The lyrical content of the band&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; was largely inspired by the massacre, with Manson saying it was a rebuttal to the accusations leveled against him by mainstream media. He also discussed the massacre and its aftermath in Michael Moore&#x27;s 2002 documentary &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;.

===Other alleged incidents===
In 2000, an elderly nun was murdered by three schoolgirls in Italy, with their diaries reportedly containing numerous references to and pictures of Manson. Soon after, he was arrested following a concert in Rome for allegedly &quot;tearing off his genitals&quot;. Manson said the arrest was politically motivated following his implication in the murder by Italian tabloids. In 2003, French media blamed Manson when several teenagers vandalized the graves of British war heroes in Arras, France.

On June 30, 2003, 14-year-old schoolgirl Jodi Jones was brutally murdered in Scotland. Her mutilated body was discovered in woodland near her home, with her injuries said to closely resemble those of Elizabeth Short, commonly referred to by media as the Black Dahlia. Ten months later, Jones&#x27;s boyfriend Luke Mitchell, then-fifteen years old, was arrested on suspicion of her murder. Police confiscated a copy of &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; containing the short film &quot;Doppelherz&quot; during a search of Mitchell&#x27;s family home, which had been purchased by Mitchell two days after Jones&#x27;s death. A ten-minute excerpt from the film, as well as several paintings created by Manson depicting the Black Dahlia&#x27;s mutilated body, were presented as evidence during the trial. Mitchell was found guilty of her murder and was sentenced to a minimum of twenty years in prison. In his closing summation, Lord Nimmo Smith said he believed Mitchell &quot;carried an image of [Manson&#x27;s] paintings in [his] memory when [he] killed Jodi&quot;. Mitchell continues to profess his innocence.

The controversy connecting Manson to school shootings continued on October 10, 2007, when fourteen-year old Asa Coon shot four people at SuccessTech Academy in Cleveland, Ohio, before committing suicide. While exiting a bathroom, Coon was punched in the face by another student, and responded by shooting his attacker in the abdomen. Coon then walked down the hallway and shot in to two occupied classrooms – wounding two teachers and a student – before entering a bathroom and committing suicide. Coon was wearing a Marilyn Manson T-shirt during the shooting. A photograph of Coon&#x27;s dead body was circulated online by Cleveland police officer Walter Emerick. On May 18, 2009, Justin Doucet, a fifteen-year-old student at Larose-Cut Off Middle School in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, entered the school with a semi-automatic pistol. After a teacher refused to comply with Doucet&#x27;s demand to say &quot;Hail Marilyn Manson&quot;, he fired two shots that narrowly missed the teacher&#x27;s head, before shooting himself. Doucet died from his injuries a week later.

In September 2023, Manson plead nolo contendere – a no contest plea without admitting guilt – to a misdemeanor count of simple assault stemming from an incident where he allegedly blew his nose on a videographer during a concert in New Hampshire on August 19, 2019. He received a sentence of 20 hours community service and was fined $1,400, with $200 suspended. He completed his community service with a Californian organization that facilitates meetings hosted by Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon.

===Abuse allegations===
In 2018, actor Charlyne Yi accused Manson of harassing them and other women on the set of the series &quot;House&quot;. Several of Manson&#x27;s former acquaintances began communicating with one another in September 2020. In a letter dated January 21, 2021, California State Senator Susan Rubio wrote to the director of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney General, asking them to investigate allegations several women had made against Manson. On February 1, former fiancée Evan Rachel Wood wrote on Instagram and in a statement to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, accusing Manson of being abusive during their relationship a decade earlier. Four other women simultaneously issued statements also accusing Manson of abuse. Wood continued to make allegations against Manson and his wife Lindsay Usich on Instagram, claiming that his alleged abuse included antisemitism, and said she filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department against Usich for threatening to leak photographs of Wood dressed in a Nazi uniform while wearing an Adolf Hitler-style toothbrush moustache. A total of sixteen people have made various allegations against Manson, including five accusations of sexual assault.

Manson was immediately dropped by distributing record label Loma Vista Recordings, his talent agency Creative Artists, and his long-time manager Tony Ciulla. He was also removed from future episodes of TV series &quot;American Gods&quot; and &quot;Creepshow&quot;, in which he was scheduled to appear. On February 2, Manson issued a statement via Instagram, saying, &quot;Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners&quot;, and claimed the accusers were &quot;misrepresenting the past&quot;. His former wife Dita Von Teese said &quot;the details made public do not match my personal experience during our 7 years together as a couple&quot;. Former girlfriend Rose McGowan said that Manson was not abusive during their relationship but that her experience had &quot;no bearing on whether he was like that with others before or after&quot;. On February 3, the LAPD performed a &quot;welfare check&quot; at Manson&#x27;s home after receiving a call from a purported friend who was concerned for his wellbeing. The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department confirmed on February 19 that they were investigating Manson due to allegations of domestic violence.

Five women filed civil lawsuits against Manson in the months that followed Wood&#x27;s allegations: Esmé Bianco, Ashley Morgan Smithline, Ashley Walters, and two Jane Does. Manson&#x27;s legal team issued statements denying the allegations. They filed a motion to dismiss these lawsuits, calling the claims &quot;untrue, meritless&quot; and alleging that several of the accusers &quot;spent months plotting, workshopping, and fine-tuning their stories to turn what were consensual friendships and relationships with Warner from more than a decade ago, into twisted tales that bear no resemblance to reality&quot;. The lawsuit filed by the anonymous woman was initially dismissed because it exceeded the statute of limitations, although an amended complaint was refiled soon after. Manson&#x27;s legal team also sought to have Bianco&#x27;s lawsuit dismissed because it exceeded the statute of limitations, although a federal judge denied that motion. Walters&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in May, but was reinstated in December 2023 following an appeal to the California Courts of Appeal. The appellate court agreed that her lawsuit should be excluded from the statute of limitations because she claimed she had suppressed her memories. Smithline&#x27;s lawsuit was also dismissed by a federal judge, after her lawyer withdrew from her case and she did not meet a court-ordered deadline regarding her representation in the case. Bianco and Manson reached an out-of-court settlement in January 2023 with undisclosed terms of agreement.

In January 2023, another plaintiff identified as Jane Doe filed a lawsuit against him, alleging that he groomed and sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. The lawsuit also named defunct record label Nothing Records and its parent company Interscope as co-defendants, accusing them of being aware of Manson&#x27;s alleged abuse. Substantive portions of this lawsuit were dismissed in July 2024, as the claims fell outside the remit of New York&#x27;s Adult Survivors Act, in which the lawsuit was filed. Smithline recanted her allegations in legal documents in February 2023, claiming she was &quot;manipulated&quot; and &quot;pressured&quot; by Wood and her associates to make allegations against Manson that were &quot;not true&quot;. In September 2023, Manson settled the first Jane Doe lawsuit. The settlement was reached in the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles and was made the week before the case was scheduled to go to trial.

Manson filed a lawsuit against Wood and Ashley &quot;Illma&quot; Gore for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violations of the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act, as well as the impersonation of an FBI agent and falsifying federal documents. The suit alleged that Wood and Gore spent three years contacting his former girlfriends, and that the pair impersonated and falsified documents from an FBI agent. The suit additionally claimed Gore hacked Manson&#x27;s computers and social media, and created fake emails to manufacture evidence he was distributing &quot;illicit pornography&quot;. It also alleged that Gore swatted Manson by calling the FBI claiming to be a friend concerned about an &quot;emergency&quot; at his home. As a result of the call, several police officers and a helicopter were dispatched to his property, where &quot;there was no emergency&quot;. He sought a jury trial. A portion of the defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims of the lawsuit, specifically his allegation that Wood and Gore forged an FBI letter and publicly spread false claims regarding his unreleased short film &quot;Groupie&quot;, were dismissed after the two filed anti-SLAPP notices. Manson was ordered to pay Wood and Gore&#x27;s legal fees, totaling almost $500,000. He initially appealed the anti-SLAPP ruling, but discontinued the suit in November 2024, agreeing to pay Wood&#x27;s legal fees.

The LACSD presented the findings of their 19-month investigation of the sexual assault allegations made against Manson to California district attorney George Gascón in September 2022. Gascón called the file &quot;partial&quot; and said more evidence was needed to file charges. On October 10, 2024, Gascón announced he was considering new evidence in the case. Bianco alleged Gascón had been mishandling the case and that Gascón had refused to speak with her since filing her complaint over two years ago. In January 2025, the LACSD concluded their 4-year criminal investigation of the abuse allegations, and Gascón&#x27;s successor Nathan Hochman said charges would not be filed against Manson for either domestic violence or sexual abuse, because &quot;we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;, and that the claims fell outside of the statute of limitations.

<doc id="650427" wikidata="Q7988104" url="?curid=650427" title="Western New York">
<text>Western New York (WNY) is the westernmost region of the U.S. state of New York. The eastern boundary of the region is not consistently defined by state agencies or those who call themselves &quot;Western New Yorkers&quot;. Almost all sources agree WNY includes the cities of Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Jamestown, and the surrounding suburbs, as well as the outlying rural areas of Niagara Frontier, and Chautauqua-Alleghany (or the western Southern Tier). Many would also place Rochester and the Genesee Valley in the region, although those legally belong in the Finger Lakes Region and are separate from Western New York Region.

The State of New York sometimes defines the WNY region as including just five counties: Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, and Niagara. The state&#x27;s Empire State Development Corporation and state health authorities have both mapped the region this way. The state has also used this regional boundary to set policy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More commonly, WNY has been defined to include at least Genesee, Orleans, and Wyoming counties as well. Almost all descriptions of WNY in the Buffalo media market define it as this eight county area. Most organizations that use WNY in their name including the WNY College Consortium, the WNY Genealogical Society, WNY PRISM, the Psychological Association of WNY, and the WNY Land Conservancy describe themselves as working in these eight counties.

Others, such as Clarion Publications, the publisher of the WNY Travel Guide and WesternNY.com, have used the term Western New York to describe a much larger area consisting of 17 counties. In addition to those counties mentioned, they add Chemung, Livingston, Monroe, Ontario, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, and Yates as well.

The rest of this article uses that definition. The 17 counties have a land area of . They include the area of the Holland Purchase and the Phelps and Gorham Purchase.

The area is primarily served by Buffalo and Rochester media markets, although there is considerable overlap between these two markets, as well as other American and Canadian media markets (particularly from nearby Toronto). In terms of the combined statistical areas used by the United States Census Bureau, Western New York consists of the Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Olean, NY area, the Rochester-Batavia-Seneca Falls, NY area, and the Elmira-Corning, NY area.

Western New York is in some contexts considered a sub-region of &quot;Upstate New York&quot; (when that term is used to describe all of New York State outside Long Island and the New York City metropolitan area); in most cases however, New Yorkers identify by specific regionalities such as Western New York or Central New York in preference to the vague and broader term Upstate New York.

==Subregions==

Western New York is generally considered to have 2-4 subregions:
# Greater Niagara
# Chautauqua-Allegheny
# Genesee 
# Western Finger Lakes (sometimes considered part of Central New York)

The Greater Niagara Region (or the Niagara Frontier), comprises Niagara and Erie counties and parts of Genesee and Wyoming counties. It is named for its major features, the Niagara river and Niagara Falls. Buffalo is its largest urban center.

The Chautauqua–Allegheny Region (also known as Southwestern New York or the Western Southern Tier) comprises Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, and Allegany counties. The region is mountainous. The largest urban center is Jamestown, and Lake Chautauqua and Allegany State Park are major geographical features.

The third region, the Genesee Region, comprises Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, Orleans, Ontario, and Yates counties and parts of Genessee and Wyoming counties. Rochester is its largest urban center. Letchworth State Park is a major geographical feature.

The fourth region is that of the western Finger Lakes Region composed of parts of Seneca, Steuben, Schuyler, and Chemung counties. While parts of the Finger Lakes are considered within Western New York (as either a region or quadrant) the eastern portions are typically considered a part of Central New York.

The Genesee region and Western Finger Lakes region are often combined and described as the Finger Lakes region.

Western New York also includes several Seneca Nation enclaves.

== Population ==

If it were counted as a single area, the population of Western New York would number just over 2.6 million, and would rank as the 24th largest metropolitan area of the United States, between the Pittsburgh metropolitan area and the Sacramento, California metropolitan area. However, the U.S. Census Bureau has classified the Buffalo and Rochester areas as two different metropolitan areas. If it were counted as a state, the population of Western New York would rank as the 37th most populated state in the United States.

== Climate ==

Western New York has a humid continental climate heavily influenced by both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Winters are long and cold, often lasting from around mid-November to early April. There are often snows before and after that period, as well. Western New York is known for its lake effect snows, which can result in highly localized, sometimes intense and even historic snow events. Lake effect storms are a result of cold air picking up water vapor as it blows over warm lake waters. Lake effect snows are usually most active between November and February and typically diminish when Lake Erie freezes over. Generally, the heaviest amount of snow in Western New York during the winter falls near the southern end of Erie County as well as in Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, and Wyoming counties. Spring and fall in Western New York are usually short and changeable. The presence of the lakes allows for fruit growing and wine production along areas adjacent to both lakes, which retard the development of damaging spring and fall frost, thereby extending the growing season. Lost in its famed winters, Western New York summers are among the sunniest in the Northeast and are generally very pleasant. Thanks in part to breezes blowing over Lakes Erie and Ontario (which are usually cooler than the air temperature in the summer), most of Western New York enjoy generally cooler and more comfortable summers than other regions in the same climatic zone.

===Major airports===

Western New York has two airports that provide significant regular passenger service, Buffalo-Niagara International Airport and Greater Rochester International Airport. Buffalo-Niagara International Airport is the most patronized airport facility in Western New York. While it primarily serves as the regional airport for the Buffalo-Niagara Falls Metropolitan Area, the facility doubles as a gateway to Canada, and a good portion of its passengers (33%) are Canadian. The second major airport in Western New York, Greater Rochester International Airport, does not see as much traffic as Buffalo-Niagara International Airport. Still, located just three nautical miles southwest of Downtown Rochester, the facility provides convenient access to airline service for many residents of the Rochester Metropolitan Area.

===Railroad service===

The northern part of Western New York features four railroad stations in service on the Empire Corridor: Rochester, Buffalo-Depew, Buffalo-Exchange Street and Niagara Falls. The Buffalo-Exchange Street and Niagara Falls stations do not see as much rail service as the other two Western New York stations due to the fact that, west of Depew Station, Amtrak&#x27;s Lake Shore Limited leaves the Empire Corridor en route to the Midwest. For a period of time, there were proposals to service these four stations with high-speed rail. A major objective of implementing high-speed rail service was to better connect Western New York as well as the rest of Upstate New York with New York City. However, little of substance has come of these proposals.

Service to other parts of Western New York ended from the mid-1960s to 1970. The Erie Lackawanna&#x27;s &quot;Phoebe Snow&quot; served on a southeastern trajectory from Buffalo to Elmira, Binghamton, Scranton and Hoboken; service ended in 1966. The E-L&#x27;s &quot;Lake Cities&quot; originated in Chicago, passing through Western New York&#x27;s Jamestown, then through the rest of the Southern Tier, Orange County and terminating at Hoboken, NJ; service ended on January 6, 1970. The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Day Express&quot; was another route serving Western New York, traveling south to Baltimore via Olean and Harrisburg; this train was discontinued in 1967, but an unnamed Penn Central (PC) successor lasted through April 30, 1971, when AMTRAK assumed most of the remaining U.S. rail passenger service but declined to serve the Baltimore-Harrisburg-Buffalo route of the former PRR/PC.

The Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad and WNY&amp;P both operate freight service in the region. A few shortline railroads also offer rail service, including the New York and Lake Erie Railroad and the Arcade and Attica Railroad.

===Bus service===

The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority runs regular bus service throughout the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority serves Rochester and surrounding counties, and the Chautauqua Area Regional Transit System serves Chautauqua County. First Transit contracts with the Seneca Nation of Indians, the Olean Area Transit System and Access Allegany to provide public transportation to most of the Southern Tier.

In addition to the public transportation authorities, which provide limited intercity connections, several commercial intercity bus services also operate. Coach USA operates a loop service between Buffalo, Jamestown and Olean; the bus connects to a route to New York City in Olean and to Megabus service to Toronto and New York City in Buffalo. Fullington Trailways operates a daily rural route between Buffalo and various locations in Pennsylvania; New York Trailways also serves Buffalo and Rochester, connecting to various locations, as does Greyhound Bus Lines. One discount &quot;Chinatown service&quot; operates in Western New York; Ocean Travel runs an overnight express service between Buffalo, Rochester and New York City.

== History ==

In its early history, Western New York was settled by native cultures including the Hopewell. The territory of Western New York, until the 17th century, was held by the Neutral Nation in the northern Niagara region and the Wenrohronon and Erie Indians around the Allegheny River. The Seneca nation and their allies in the Iroquois Confederacy eliminated those tribes in wars during the Beaver Wars between 1638 and 1701, with any survivors being assimilated into the Senecas (in the case of the Erie and Neutral) or Huron (in the case of the Wenro). The Neutral territory is currently held by Tuscaroras, who moved up from the Carolinas while refugees from the Erie tribes moved south to the Carolinas.

French forces settled in parts of what is now Western New York through much of the 17th century, beginning with Étienne Brûlé&#x27;s pass-through of the region in 1615 and Joseph de La Roche Daillon&#x27;s missionary journeys in the 1620s; some relics of their presence, including Fort Niagara and a portage road that follows modern New York State Route 394 between Lake Erie and Chautauqua Lake, are still visible in the region.

Western New York&#x27;s land was acquired from the Iroquois through the Nanfan Treaty, which ceded the territory to England at the end of the Beaver Wars in 1701. At the time, four of the British colonies (Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut) laid claim to the unsettled territory, as did New France until the Seven Years&#x27; War. Most of Western New York was officially off-limits to all of the colonies as a result of the establishment of an Indian Reserve over the area following the Seven Years&#x27; War. By the 1780s, only New York and Massachusetts still maintained their claims to the territory, which was separated from mainland New York by a Preemption Line.

Under federal policy designed to extinguish the states&#x27; Revolutionary War debts, the states were required to extinguish their western land claims. Massachusetts extinguished its claim to the territory in exchange for receiving the profits from its sale to settlers. New York was the only colony not to extinguish its western claim, and by way of the 1786 Treaty of Hartford, the land, with the exception of a small triangle that was ceded to Pennsylvania in 1792, officially became Western New York. (Had New York extinguished its claim, it would have likely become part of the Northwest Territory established the next year and formed part of a new state.) Native title, with the exception of several reservations, was extinguished in the Treaty of Canandaigua in 1794, while the Phelps and Gorham Purchase and Holland Purchase opened the territory for settling. During the War of 1812 Western New York was part of the borderland frontier between the United States and British Canada and became the scene of various military actions.

The two major Western New York cities, Buffalo and Rochester, benefited greatly from the opening of the Erie Canal. With its strategic position at the western end of the Erie Canal, the eastern end of Lake Erie and proximity to Niagara Falls and Canada, Buffalo emerged as a major port. Niagara Falls provided Buffalo with a ready supply of power, so much so that one of its enduring nicknames is &quot;The City of Light&quot;. Buffalo experienced steady growth during the 19th century and at one point was one of the 10 most populated cities in the United States. According to some, Rochester was &quot;America&#x27;s First Boomtown&quot; and was a key player in the flour industry (hence its initial nickname &quot;Flour City&quot;). Its growth was attributed to both the completion of the Erie Canal and its resulting significance in the flour industry. Olean was originally planned to be a similar major hub, but it proved to be at a major disadvantage: located near the headwaters of the Allegheny River (a factor its planners had hoped would make the city a gateway to the Midwest), the river was too shallow to support large boat travel or shipping on a consistent basis. As a region, Western New York played a significant role in the American economy during the 19th century. Large scale immigration from Ireland, Italy, Poland, Great Britain and Germany soon followed into the region.

The New Religious Movement known as Spiritualism was among several that arose in the early 19th century burned-over district of Western New York. Its major center is Lily Dale, one of the largest spiritualism communities in the United States. The original house of the Fox sisters was relocated to Lily Dale in 1916. Joseph Smith Jr., founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, reported receiving the Book of Mormon in Palmyra, Wayne County. The women&#x27;s civic organization Zonta was founded in Buffalo in 1919.

In the late 20th century this area became part of the Rust Belt of the United States, being a focal point for the transportation of grain, steel, and coal. The opening of the Welland Canal in 1957 effectively rendered the narrower Erie Canal obsolete, further exacerbating economic problems in the region. The area saw an economic decline during the period of deindustrialization, leaving many empty steel mills including those of Bethlehem Steel, which was the 2nd largest steel mill in the world. The plant located in Lackawanna, New York provided nearly 25,000 jobs to the local economy. Republic Steel also had a large integrated steel mill located in South Buffalo. General Motors in Tonawanda is the largest vehicle engine plant in the world, which still is a major contributor to the Buffalo area economy. Ford Motor Company also maintains a large manufacturing facility in Woodlawn, New York, which is just south of Buffalo.

==Culture==
 
Western New York is culturally a Great Lakes/Interior Northeastern area, with a dose of Appalachia in the Southern Tier, an overlapping region of the state. Buffalo appears to have similarities to other Great Lakes cities/areas, while having Northeastern proclivities. The similarities with Chicago and Milwaukee run the list from sharing a common industrial base traditionally built around steel and automobile manufacturing. The cities were both developed during the same period in American history, so the street patterns, architecture, and ethnic communities share a similar appearance. Linguistically, Western New York is part of the Inland North region of American English, which means it is subject to the Northern Cities vowel shift; a distinct variant of that accent, &quot;Buffalo English&quot;, is heard in many parts of the region.

Finally, most Western New York sports fans support the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres. Team loyalties of sports fans in the rest of upstate New York are more divided. Most baseball fans support the Cleveland Guardians, New York Yankees and New York Mets, although the Toronto Blue Jays have seen an increase in support due to the influx of Canadians in the area - as well as the region&#x27;s proximity to Toronto, the Blue Jays&#x27; increased on-field success in the mid-2010s, the affiliation with the longstanding minor league Buffalo Bisons, and the Blue Jays playing much of their 2020 and 2021 schedule in Buffalo. The Pittsburgh Pirates have some following in southwestern New York, and teams with national fanbases such as the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs also have followings. The region has no clear favorite professional basketball franchise, with the Brooklyn Nets, Cleveland Cavaliers, New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors all claiming parts of the region as part of their regional broadcasting territories. (Western New York puts more emphasis on college basketball, where the &quot;Big 4&quot; Division I programs—Canisius, Niagara, St. Bonaventure and UB—all have strong followings and rivalries; while most attention has been centered around the men&#x27;s college basketball teams, the recent success of UB and St. Bonaventure&#x27;s women&#x27;s teams has led to increased attention to women&#x27;s basketball in the region. The college basketball scene once had enough clout to help drive Buffalo&#x27;s NBA team, the 1970s-era Buffalo Braves, out of the city.) Syracuse University sports, being the closest major-conference school to the region, also has a sizable following in western New York, particularly in basketball. College football interest is minimal, with no team having a major following (not even UB, who has struggled to maintain its Division I football program despite modest success). For hockey, other than the Buffalo Sabres, the region is also home to a number of Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins supporters.

==Food==
===Region-wide===
&quot;Friday night fish fry&quot; is also regionally popular, a holdover from when Catholics were forbidden to eat meat on Fridays. It is usually skinless cod although most restaurants in the area claim they use the higher quality haddock, and is frequently beer-battered, deep fried, and served with French fries and cole slaw. Numerous restaurants in Western New York have a Friday fish fry special. The fish fry retains particular popularity during Lent, when Catholics are still barred from eating meat on Friday.

Italian-American food is a specialty in western New York. Most towns in the region have pizzerias. The Texas hot, introduced by Greek immigrants in the 1920s, has a strong following in the region, and several hot dog stands offer the dish. Longstanding Texas hot stands include Ted&#x27;s Hot Dogs in Buffalo (1927), Rigas Texas Hot in Wellsville (1921), and Johnny&#x27;s Lunch in Jamestown (1936; the Colera family is also tied to several other Jamestown stands such as AJ Texas Hots, which launched in 1968, and Michael&#x27;s, which operated from 1976 to 2021).

The region produces many agricultural products, including milk, maple syrup, apples, cherries, potatoes, sweet corn, strawberries, raspberries, peaches, and grapes. As with the rest of Upstate New York, dairy farming is an important part of the economy. New York State is a leading producer among the states of dairy, maple, and wine.

===Buffalo area===

Perhaps the best-known food specialty of Western New York is Buffalo chicken wings (known locally simply as &#x27;wings&#x27; or &#x27;chicken wings&#x27;). The two best-known places to get wings are Duff&#x27;s and the Anchor Bar, which have a strong local rivalry in Buffalo and both are expanding outside the city.

At the 1885 Erie County Fair (known as the Hamburg Fair) in Hamburg, New York, Frank and Charles Menches sold a ground beef sandwich, which is one of the earliest claims of the invention of the hamburger.

Beef on Weck is a regional favorite and a local invention in which sliced warm roast beef is piled high on a Kummelweck roll topped with caraway seeds and large grained salt, &quot;au jus&quot; and horseradish are often added to the sandwich.

Butter lambs are a popular tradition in Buffalo during the Lenten season leading into Easter. The Broadway Market, a market in Buffalo, is famous for this product.

===Rochester area===

The Rochester area is known for the Garbage Plate. It was created and continues to be served by Nick Tahou Hots on West Main Street. The name &quot;Garbage Plate&quot; is trademarked by Nick Tahou&#x27;s, but other Rochester restaurants serve the same or similar dish under other names, usually containing the word &quot;plate&quot;. The Rochester Red Wings baseball team concessions at Frontier Field, for example, offer the &quot;Home Plate&quot;.

A component of the garbage plate and many other local dishes is a topping known in Rochester as &quot;hot sauce.&quot; The term in this context does not refer to a pepper sauce, but to a spiced sauce containing bits of meat.

Another food associated with the Rochester area is the &quot;white hot&quot;, a hot dog with a slight variation of ingredients that appears without the distinctive pink color of most hot dogs; when ordering a hot dog in Rochester it is common to be asked to clarify whether it should be &quot;red or white&quot;.

==Economy==

In urban areas in Western New York, education, business, light manufacturing and tourism have replaced heavy manufacturing which left the area at the end of World War II. Rochester and Buffalo were especially hard-hit with the exodus of manufacturing jobs to other areas of the United States and nations like China and Mexico. Niagara Falls was also hard-hit and has shed half of its population since its peak in 1960. Today, major corporations in Western New York include Kodak, Wegmans, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Xerox, M&amp;T Bank, KeyBank and Moog, among many others. General Motors continues to operate three facilities in the region. Rochester Components Operations, formerly known as Rochester Division, produces fuel system components. Lockport Operations, formerly Harrison Thermal Systems, produces cooling system components and was awarded $154 million for additional and future products in 2022. Finally, Tonawanda Power Train originally opened in 1938 as a Chevrolet engine plant and continues producing 4 and 8 cylinder engines in the Buffalo area.

Outside of the cities, agriculture has always been a major factor in the economy, especially dairy farming.

Ski country runs through Western New York. Glenwood and Ellicottville both have multiple ski resorts within their boundaries; Ellicottville, in particular, has seen massive gentrification from the development of the large ski resorts within the town boundaries and has attempted to build on that growth by branding itself as a year-round destination with numerous festivals. At their peak in the 1960s, over a dozen ski resorts were in Western New York, most of them in Cattaraugus County.

In Niagara County, viticulture, or wine culture, is also becoming a driver of the economy. In order to take advantage of this, the state has created the Niagara Wine Trail. To a certain extent, viticulture is also prominent in Chautauqua County, where Welch&#x27;s has a long history; the western Finger Lakes also have a wine industry.

American Rock Salt, the largest operating salt mine in the United States, is located in Livingston County.

During the late 1990s, then-Governor George Pataki signed an agreement granting the Seneca Nation of New York the right to acquire and build three full-scale casino gaming operations. The three casinos (Seneca Niagara Casino in Niagara Falls, Seneca Allegany Casino in Salamanca and the controversial Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino in Buffalo) are the only casinos that operate over all of Western New York as part of the agreement, for which the Senecas pay a portion of revenues to the state of New York (which, in turn, returns part of that money to the host municipalities). Twice over the course of the compact&#x27;s history have the Senecas stopped paying their exclusivity payments: once in a dispute over whether video lottery terminals constituted the breach of the agreement, and again in 2017 after the Senecas claimed they are no longer required to pay the exclusivity payments but still maintain exclusivity under the language of the agreement.

The three native tribes in the region (Seneca Nation, Tonawanda Band and Tuscarora) also have a large influence in the convenience store sector. The tribes have long maintained that they are exempt from state excise taxes on gasoline and tobacco products, which allows native-owned convenience stores to provide lower prices than their non-native counterparts. Gasoline tax advantages were most pronounced in the 1990s, when low overall gas prices made the tax advantage far more noticeable. In the 1990s and 2000s, a mail-order tobacco industry thrived on Seneca reservations, an industry that has mostly been cut off since then. Increasing regulations now prohibit Senecas from receiving or selling name-brand cigarettes without taxes, sending tobacco products by mail (Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act) or private delivery, or accepting credit cards for remote purchases; the Senecas still sell native-produced tobacco products in brick-and-mortar stores on the reservations. Large tobacco farms can be seen in much of the Cattaraugus Reservation to meet the demand for native-grown, tax-exempt tobacco.

== Major attractions ==
Western New York is home to two significant scenic attractions. Niagara Falls is undoubtedly the most famous attraction in Western New York. Forming part of Western New York&#x27;s border with Canada, the Falls has evolved into a major destination for tourists and locals alike.

Another, less famous scenic attraction, is Letchworth State Park. Located 35 miles south of Rochester, Letchworth State Park has been termed &quot;The Grand Canyon of the East&quot;.

Allegany State Park in southern Cattaraugus County offers 65,000 acres of recreation space for camping, hiking, cabin rentals, swimming, and (during the winter) snowmobiling and cross-country skiing. It is mostly surrounded by the Allegany Indian Reservation and to the south by the Allegheny National Forest.

Western New York is also known as the home of the Chautauqua Institution near Jamestown, New York. Jamestown is also home to the Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Museum.

A small, but important, historic site is the Holland Land Office in Batavia, New York.

Many towns along a nationally important historic site, the Erie Canal, have lovely waterfront parks and bike trails.

The Genesee Country Village and Museum in Mumford, New York is a well-known living history museum.

The George Eastman House is in Rochester, and is the world&#x27;s oldest photography museum.

The Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site, known locally as the Wilcox Mansion, is in Buffalo. It is the site of the first presidential inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt following the assassination of President William McKinley who had been attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901.

Darien Lake, a theme park and concert venue in Genesee County, is also a popular summertime destination, drawing in crowds from all over Western and Central New York, as well as from southern Ontario. It has benefited from its location about halfway between Buffalo and Rochester and is one of the region&#x27;s most successful concert venues.

== Sports ==
===Major professional teams===
Western New York is represented by two major league sports teams: the Buffalo Bills of the NFL and the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL. The Bills play their home football games at Highmark Stadium, the largest sports stadium in all of New York State, located just south of the city of Buffalo in Orchard Park. The Bills are the only team to reach the Super Bowl in four consecutive seasons (1990–1993) in NFL history.

The Buffalo Sabres also have a strong following in Western New York, and are consistently ranked among the highest-rated local TV hockey markets and the highest-rated markets for NBC/NBCSN regular season games. Primarily because of the strong regional interest in the team, in 2016 MSG Western New York was launched. The regional sports network is a sub-feed of the MSG Network, but is tilted towards Western New York sports and controlled by Pegula Sports and Entertainment. The Sabres reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 1975 and 1999. The Toronto Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators are the Sabres&#x27; biggest rivals. On January 1, 2008, the Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins in the inaugural Winter Classic at Ralph Wilson Stadium (now Highmark Stadium). This was the first ever regular-season NHL game held outdoors to be played in the United States.

Rochester is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States to not include a major professional team.

=== Minor professional teams and semi-professional teams ===

==== Baseball ====
Three Minor League Baseball teams play in Western New York: the Buffalo Bisons and Rochester Red Wings, both in the Triple-A International League North Division, and affiliates of the Toronto Blue Jays and Washington Nationals, respectively.

Collegiate summer baseball has an extensive presence in the area. The New York Collegiate Baseball League has several teams in Western New York (the Niagara Power, Wellsville Nitros, Alfred Thunder, Geneva Red Wings, Olean Oilers and Webster Yankees), as does the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League (the Jamestown Tarp Skunks and the formerly-professional Batavia Muckdogs).

==== Football ====

Western New York has several teams that participate in semi-professional and amateur football. The Northeastern Football Alliance hosts teams in Buffalo, Jamestown, Olean and Lyndonville; the Premier Amateur Football League operates a team in South Buffalo.

==== Hockey ====
The Buffalo Sabres minor league affiliate, the Rochester Americans, play in the American Hockey League.

==== Lacrosse ====

Lacrosse, the national sport of the native Iroquois, is popular in the region, with the Buffalo Bandits and Rochester Knighthawks both perennial contenders in the National Lacrosse League. From 2008 to 2017 lacrosse fans could also watch the Rochester Rattlers of Major League Lacrosse during the summer months or attend box lacrosse games in arenas on the Seneca reservations.

====Soccer====
Western New York currently does not have a team in Major League Soccer (occasionally considered the fifth major league on the American sporting landscape), although Rochester had been mentioned in the past as a candidate for a new expansion franchise and previously hosted the Rochester Lancers in MLS&#x27;s predecessor, the NASL. The speculation of Rochester getting an MLS team was due to the relative success of the Rochester Rhinos. However, the Rhinos later a downturn in attendance due to a number of factors leading to the team going dormant in 2018 and re-emerging as Rochester, NY FC in a lower division of soccer in 2022. Such speculation has also decreased in the 21st century, in part because of MLS&#x27;s refusal to put teams in metropolitan areas without any other major league teams and greatly increased competition for MLS expansion franchises. The former Rhinos franchise are best known as being the only non-MLS team to win the US Open Cup since that competition was opened to MLS teams.

Western New York was represented in National Women&#x27;s Soccer League by the Western New York Flash, a team that originally began play in the W-league in 2008. The Flash, like the Rhinos, played its home games at Sahlen&#x27;s Stadium in Rochester but were based out of suburban Buffalo. U.S. soccer star Abby Wambach was a member of the Flash. In 2017 the team transferred its NWSL rights to North Carolina and self-relegated to an amateur team. The Western New York region is home to FC Buffalo and the current incarnation of the Rochester Lancers, both of whom compete in the NPSL.

No indoor soccer teams currently play in the region. The region had previously been represented by the Buffalo Stallions, Buffalo Blizzard and another Rochester Lancers.

=== Other sports ===

====Golf====

Western New York is home to many different golf coursees and country clubs including: Oak Hill Country Club, Grover Cleveland Golf Course, Niagara Falls Country Club, Hyde Park Golf Club, The Park Country Club, Beaver Island State Park Golf Course, and River Oak Golf Club, Locust Hill among others.

====Motorsports====

A number of Motorsports tracks operate in Western New York. The most prominent of these is Holland Speedway, a NASCAR-sanctioned track (currently hosting races in the Whelen All-American Series). Other, generally dirt, tracks include Stateline Speedway in Busti, Little Valley Speedway in Little Valley, Freedom Raceway in Freedom, Chapel Hill Raceway in Humphrey, Ransomville Speedway in Ransomville and Canandaigua Motorsports Park in Canandaigua. The last of these is the location in which NASCAR driver Tony Stewart ran over and killed rival racer Kevin Ward Jr. in 2014 during a sprint car race.

===College and high school sports===

College hockey also has a following, with Canisius College, Niagara University, and Rochester Institute of Technology competing at the Division I level and several other teams (including most of the SUNY schools) competing in Division III and/or the ACHA.

College basketball has several teams in the area. The four teams in Division I are known as the &quot;Big 4&quot; and include the Canisius Golden Griffins, Niagara Purple Eagles, UB Bulls, and St. Bonaventure Bonnies. Prior to UB&#x27;s ascension to Division I, the three other schools—all Roman Catholic institutions—were known as the Little Three. In addition to the men&#x27;s teams, the women&#x27;s basketball teams of UB and St. Bonaventure have earned national success in the 2010s.

College football is much more sparse; only one team competes at the Division I Bowl Subdivision, the State University of New York at Buffalo&#x27;s UB Bulls. Erie Community College fields a team in junior college football known as the Kats, while Buffalo State, Brockport State, The University of Rochester, St. John Fisher College, Alfred State and Alfred University field teams at the Division III level.

Greater Rochester is the largest metropolitan area in the United States to not include a college or university with a full NCAA Division I athletic program. Rochester Institute of Technology competes in Division I only in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey, and therefore cannot offer athletic scholarships.

Public high school athletic teams compete in sections 5 (Rochester area) and 6 (Buffalo area) of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association. Western New York Roman Catholic high schools compete in the Monsignor Martin Athletic Association.

<doc id="650428" wikidata="Q6901700" url="?curid=650428" title="Monolog">
<text>A Monolog is a single telephone line call logging device manufactured by British Telecom in the UK. The reason for connecting Monolog to a telephone line is to collect independent call and charging data to help resolve customer queries or complaints.

Monolog is usually connected to a customer&#x27;s line at the telephone exchange although it is possible to monitor the line at the customer&#x27;s premises.

Monolog is based on the Mitsubishi M50734SP-10 8-bit processor that uses an enhanced 6502 instruction set. The unit has two boards: a digital board that contains EPROM and RAM for storage of call records and an analogue board that provides the necessary interface components to the monitored telephone line.

Monolog is powered via four AA rechargeable batteries which are trickle charged at approximately 2 mA from a control line. This control line is also used for remote connection to the unit for the purposes of data retrieval.

==Analogue board==
The analogue board provides the interface circuitry between the monitored and control telephone lines and the microprocessor. The board contains the following ICs;

* U1 = OP490 - Quad op-amp
* U2 = Mitel MT8870CE - DTMF decoder
* U3 = Motorola MC145442 - Single-chip V.21 300-Baud modem
* U4 = LM358N - Dual low power op-amp
* U5 = Phillips 74HC157 - Quad 2-input multiplexer

The board also contain a 25-way female D-type connector that provides the electrical interface to the monitored/control lines. Alternatively, it provides an RS-232 interface thereby enabling the direct connection of a PC running the &quot;Dialog&quot; software.

===Battery charging circuit===
Monolog&#x27;s batteries can be charged via two spare pins on the 25-way D-type connector; pin 4 (RTS) and pin 20 (DTR). If a 12volt power source is applied to either pin, the batteries are charged at 22 mA. If both pins are used, the batteries are charged at 44 mA. The 12 volt feed is via two 330 Ω current limiting resistors and the wired in fuse. This circuitry does not provide any protection against over-charging.

==Digital board==
The digital board contains seven integrated circuits as follows:

* U1 = M50734-SP10 Mitsubishi microprocessor
* U2 = 74HC373P address latch
* U3 = CD4060BCN 14-bit asynchronous binary counter
* U4 = 74HC139N address decoder
* U5 = Static RAM (130 kB)
* U6 = 27C256BQ EPROM
* U7 = Static RAM (32 kB)

In addition to these components are the reverse battery protection diode associated timing circuitry for the processor and CMOS divider IC.

===Real time clock===
To enable the call records to be date stamped, the CMOS divider IC produces an interrupt pulse every 125 ms which activates the processor. The interrupt service routing updates the system clock and checks for any activity on the line. If there is none, the processor goes back to the SLEEP mode. In this mode, the CPU consumes very little power thereby enabling the unit to be battery powered. In its quiescent state, Monolog consumes around 180 μA while the monitored telephone line is inactive, rising to a peak of about 6 mA during a call while the DTMF decoder is on during the first 20 to 30 seconds of a call.

<text>Henry Gabriel Cisneros (born June 11, 1947) is an American politician and businessman. He served as the mayor of San Antonio, Texas, from 1981 to 1989, the second Latino mayor of a major American city and the city&#x27;s first since 1842 (when Juan Seguín was forced out of office). A Democrat, Cisneros served as the 10th Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the administration of President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1997. As HUD Secretary, Cisneros was credited with initiating the revitalization of many public housing developments and with formulating policies that contributed to achieving the nation&#x27;s highest ever rate of home ownership. In his role as the President&#x27;s chief representative to the cities, Cisneros personally worked in more than two hundred cities spread over all fifty states. Cisneros&#x27;s decision to leave the HUD position and not serve a second term was overshadowed by controversy involving payments to his former mistress.

Prior to his Cabinet position, Cisneros served four terms as the mayor of his hometown of San Antonio, from 1981 to 1989. As mayor, Cisneros worked to rebuild the city&#x27;s economic base, recruited convention business, attracted high tech industries, increased the level of tourism, and worked to bring more jobs to San Antonio. Before his tenure as mayor, Cisneros was elected to three two-year terms on the city council, on which he served from 1975 to 1981.

Throughout his career in politics and business, Cisneros has remained actively involved with housing development and urban revitalization. Cisneros is also an active advocate for the Latino community. He has and continues to serve on corporate boards, as well as chairing and serving on several non-profit boards to promote Latinos and the immigrant population. Cisneros has authored, edited, or collaborated on several books and is an in-demand public speaker.

After public office, Cisneros served as President and COO for the Spanish-language network Univision from 1997 to 2000 before forming American City Vista to work the nation&#x27;s leading homebuilders to create homes priced within the range of average families. That company evolved to become CityView where Cisneros is Chairman. He is a partner in the minority owned investment banking firm Siebert Cisneros Shank &amp; Co.

Cisneros co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center&#x27;s Housing Commission and Immigration Task Force.

==Personal background==
The eldest child of George and Elvira (née Munguia) Cisneros, Henry Gabriel Cisneros was born in San Antonio, Texas, in a neighborhood that bordered the city&#x27;s predominantly Mexican west side barrio (now the city&#x27;s inner west side). Cisneros was named after his mother&#x27;s youngest brother who developed Hodgkin&#x27;s disease at the age of 14 and asked from his deathbed that his sister give his name to her son. He is descended on his father&#x27;s side from early Spanish settlers in New Mexico. His mother was the daughter of Rómulo Munguía, a relatively wealthy and well connected Mexican printer and intellectual, and Carolina Malpica Munguía, an educator, radio host, and community activist, who chose to leave Mexico in 1926 after the leftist Mexican Revolution and Cristero War

Cisneros&#x27;s father, who came from a family of small farmers who had settled in Colorado after losing their Spanish land grant during the Great Depression was a federal civil servant and later an Army colonel who met Elvira Munguia while he was stationed in San Antonio. As his parents survived great adversity and advanced through life with an unfailing belief in hard work, education merit leading to a better life, Cisneros along with his two brothers and two sisters were raised in a highly structured environment that put emphasis on scholarly studies and the arts.

Cisneros received a Catholic school education, first at the Church of the Little Flower, followed by attendance at Central Catholic Marianist High School in San Antonio. He entered Texas A&amp;M University in 1964 and quickly became a student leader with the MSC Student Conference on National Affairs. In his sophomore year, he switched his major from aeronautical engineering to city management. In 1967, through MSC SCONA, Cisneros was selected to attend the annual Student Conference on United States Affairs at West Point where he first learned that U.S. cities were in serious trouble. Relating what he heard to the problems of his largely poor hometown, the meeting, plus a visit to New York City, was a personal and professional turning point for him. While at A&amp;M, he served in the Corps of Cadets as a member of the Ross Volunteers and as combined band commander of the Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band.

Graduating from A&amp;M with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1968, he went on to earn a Master of Arts in Urban and Regional Planning in 1970 from A&amp;M as well. He earned an additional Master&#x27;s in Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1973, studied urban economics and did doctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1974, and received a Doctor of Public Administration from George Washington University in 1976.

Cisneros served as an infantry officer in the Massachusetts Army National Guard while at MIT.

In 1969 Henry Cisneros married his high school sweet heart, Mary Alice Perez. They have two daughters, Teresa and Mercedes, and a son John Paul.

==Early career==
Cisneros&#x27; community-building career began in urban public service, and setting in motion a focus he would maintain through his entire career to present. The summer after earning his undergraduate degree, he worked in the office of the City Manager of San Antonio. While earning his master&#x27;s degree from Texas A&amp;M, Cisneros worked in the office of the City Manager of Bryan, Texas, and later as the assistant director of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Model Cities program for urban revitalization in San Antonio.

After completing his education at A&amp;M in January 1970, Cisneros and his wife moved to Washington, D.C., where he became the assistant to the Executive Vice President of the National League of Cities. In 1971, the year his eldest daughter Teresa Angelica was born, Cisneros was honored as a White House Fellow and served as an assistant to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Elliot Richardson.

Upon earning a Ford Foundation Grant in 1972, Cisneros and his young family moved to Boston, where he earned his second master&#x27;s degree at Harvard. During this time, he worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

In 1974, after turning down a professorship at MIT, Cisneros chose to return to San Antonio. There, he assumed a teaching faculty position in the Public Administration program at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

==Political career beginnings==
When Cisneros arrived back home, he discovered the old order, stagnant political arena in San Antonio was falling apart and now experiencing a growing socio-ethnic discontent. Since the 1950s, the Anglo-dominated Good Government League (GGL) had run the city where council members were elected at large and the majority came from wealthy ZIP codes in the Anglo populated north side. The Mexican American community believed they had been neglected for too long by a government who paid more attention to city growth in their own residential area than grievances about drainage and infrastructure in lower-valued real estate. The GGL tried to offset this by assuring one member from both west and east sides and recruited Hispanics in their slates for city council. Displaying his gift for working within the system, Cisneros ran as a city council candidate of the GGL.

After a whirlwind campaign, and eight months since returning to San Antonio, Cisneros at age 27 was elected the youngest city councilman in the city&#x27;s history in 1975, the same year his second daughter Mercedes Christina was born. (Cisneros was the youngest councilman at the time until Chip Haas&#x27; election in 2003 at age 26.) Now entrenched in city politics, Cisneros assumed a hands-on approach to governing that he promised in his campaign. He set himself on a plan to know all he could about life in the city firsthand by emptying garbage cans to learn the problems of the sanitation department, walking a beat with a police officer and administering first aid with ambulance attendants. Cisneros also visited families in public housing units, and promised that their problems would no longer be ignored.

As a city council member, Cisneros took assorted populist positions on such issues as dealing with labor, water, education, and housing, among others. All the while, he endeared himself to the Latino community, especially in the city&#x27;s predominantly Mexican American poor neighborhoods on the west side, and where he resided.

Because of the GGL&#x27;s continued authority, the city council was still roundly criticized for not being representative. During the civil-rights furor of the 1960s, the Voting Rights Act signed into law in 1965 required that racial groups be given direct representation by political districts to assure the election of a member. Significantly, in a split vote on the city council on whether to accept a Justice Department order to establish an election plan that would provide more access to the Latino community with direct representation, or challenge the order in court, Cisneros voted to accept the order. San Antonio thus moved to single-member directly represented districts in 1977. This led to the beginning of the end for the GGL and all efforts to rationalize all-city rule.

Cisneros was re-elected twice more to the city council in 1977 and 1979 as a representative of San Antonio Council District 1.

During his time on the city council, Cisneros formed a relationship with Communities Organized for Public Service (COPS), a powerful grassroots Latino advocacy group founded in 1973 whose focus was to push for development funding into the city&#x27;s Latino communities. His attention to the needs for infrastructure to the lower income Mexican American neighborhoods further elevated Cisneros&#x27; standing in the Latino community. Yet at the same time, Cisneros also looked forward to building a greater San Antonio and the socially redeeming power that comes with economic growth. As a city councilman from 1975 to 1979, Cisneros had an ability to form a political bridge between the pro-growth business interests and an underrepresented Mexican American community. He &quot;enjoyed the resources and visibility of the GGL establishment without being confined to its agenda,&quot; and &quot;built an image of an articulate, smooth, Harvard and MIT educated man.&quot; Cisneros also was a local grown home boy who &quot;cared about the problems of the common person.&quot;

He served for six years (three terms) on the City Council before being elected Mayor of San Antonio in 1981.

==Mayor of San Antonio==

Cisneros announced himself as an independent candidate for mayor in 1981. His campaigning of hopeful visions for the future of the city was able to unite the wealthy conservatives of San Antonio and the increasingly vocal Mexican American community. On April 4, 1981, Cisneros became, at age 33, the second Hispanic mayor of a major U.S. city, and the first Mexican-American mayor of San Antonio since 1842 when Juan Seguín resigned as mayor. He was elected with 62 percent of the vote. At the time of his election, San Antonio was the tenth largest city in the United States.

He was reelected to three more terms as mayor by overwhelming margins, including winning an unprecedented 94.2 percent of the vote in 1983, a 73 percent margin of victory in 1985, and 67 percent in 1987. His popularity did not rest with San Antonio&#x27;s Hispanic community alone, but with all ethnic groups in the area. In 1982, he was selected as one of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Men of America&quot; by the U.S. Jaycees, in addition to receiving a prestigious Jefferson Award for &quot;Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under.&quot;

Cisneros&#x27; campaign for mayor and subsequent election gained the attention of national media who made Cisneros the symbol of the growing Latino population in the United States. According to Richard Garcia, &quot;Cisneros, above all, exemplified the rise of the Mexican American generation and the search for … its identity.&quot; He was positively profiled by such national publications as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; listed him (along with then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton) as one of &quot;Ten Rising Stars of American Politics&quot;, and a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; profile introduced him to a televised national audience.

In his eight years as mayor of San Antonio, Cisneros attracted national attention for his success in developing new economic growth in the city&#x27;s business sector, and with his diplomatic skills to &#x27;promote cooperation&#x27; among the city&#x27;s various ethnic groups. He exercised a developmental expansion strategy that led the city to unprecedented levels of economic and cultural growths. Cisneros brought federal monies to San Antonio that further developed the downtown business district. He courted Fortune 500 companies and technology firms to set up shop locally to create jobs, enlarge the city&#x27;s reserves with local business taxes, and to cement San Antonio&#x27;s reputation as a leading city for technology, skilled work and economic output. His efforts brought additional investments to San Antonio, such as luring SeaWorld and Fiesta Texas, two major theme park tourist attractions. In his signature accomplishment, Cisneros convinced the city&#x27;s residents to vote for the city-financed construction of the Alamodome.

Cisneros also paved the way for Pope John Paul II to visit San Antonio during the pontiff&#x27;s 10-day tour to the United States in September 1987. More than one million people saw the Pope during his 22-hour visit to San Antonio, more than any other city on that 10-day tour. Cisneros&#x27; mayoral success for elevating San Antonio&#x27;s reputation and economic base as a leading city in the nation led to &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; in 1999 naming him its Texas Mayor of the Century. The publication pointed to such achievements as a downtown riverfront redevelopment that drew tourists from far and wide and contending that he had &quot;changed San Antonio&#x27;s image from a poor and somewhat sleepy town to a culturally and economically vibrant model for the future of urban America.&quot; During Cisneros&#x27; tenure as mayor, San Antonio was named an All American City for 1982–83, a prestigious honor awarded by the National Civic League.

Throughout his mayorship, Cisneros continued to live in the small house that once belonged to his grandfather in the city&#x27;s west side. He populist positions on issues that favored the poor and the working class. Cisneros also funneled more than $200 million to the city&#x27;s long neglected Hispanic west side for streets, gutters, libraries, and parks. His improvements also alleviated that area&#x27;s long standing flooding and drainage problems. Cisneros&#x27; ties to business also helped him establish an education partnership that brought together the city, the local colleges and universities, local business, and various community organizations. This partnership provided financial aid for college to young people in the poorest school districts of San Antonio.

The national visibility Cisneros gained as mayor of San Antonio led to President Ronald Reagan appointing him in 1983 to the Bipartisan Commission on Central America, chaired by Henry Kissinger. In 1984, Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale tapped Cisneros as a finalist for the vice presidential nomination, which eventually went to U.S. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro. Cisneros was selected to give the highly visible &quot;Platform Presentation&quot; at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco on July 17, 1984. His viability as a national leader was confirmed in 1985 when Cisneros was elected president of the National League of Cities. In 1986, &quot;City &amp; State&quot; magazine selected him as the &quot;Outstanding Mayor&quot; in the nation. A scholarly study of America&#x27;s mayors, &quot;The American Mayor&quot;, ranked Cisneros as one of the 15 best mayors in the nation in a period that spanned the 20th century. He was consistently touted as senatorial and/or gubernatorial material throughout his tenure as mayor, and was identified positively by both conservatives and liberals. In Señor Alcalde (&quot;Mr. Mayor&quot;), John Gillies wrote: &quot;He tried to avoid a political label, such as Democrat or Republican, because he wanted to consider the needs of all of San Antonio&#x27;s groupings... He formed a bridge between conservatives and liberals...&quot;

In 1987, Cisneros announced he would not seek a fifth two-year term as mayor and would leave public life after completing his current term as mayor. Several factors contributed to his decision. The same year, his son, John Paul Anthony, named for the pope, was born with congenital asplenia syndrome; instead of the normal four chambers, the heart functioned as if it had only two. As a result, the blood that cycled through the baby&#x27;s system was poorly oxygenated and threatened to flood his lungs as the heart grew. The condition also meant the child was born without a spleen and was 50 times more likely to contract a fatal infectious disease. Cisneros desired to devote more time with his ailing son, whose doctors had given roughly six years to live and whose life would be filled with major surgeries. When John Paul reached his sixth birthday in 1993, Cisneros told Sophfronia Scott Gregory in &quot;Time&quot; magazine of his son&#x27;s ongoing fight for life: &quot;Nothing in my life has prepared me for this.&quot;

Cisneros was one of the lowest paid major city mayors in the country, with a $4,500-per-year stipend, and had supplemented his income by speaking fees and teaching urban affairs and government at Trinity University in the Department of Urban Studies. Facing huge medical bills, along with two daughters rapidly approaching college age, Cisneros also hoped to make more money in private industry.

In 1989, Cisneros left public office and became chairman of the Cisneros Asset Management Company, a national asset-management investment firm that managed $550 million in fixed-income accounts. During this period, he hosted &quot;Texans&quot;, a one-hour television show produced quarterly in Texas, and &quot;Adelante&quot;, a national daily Spanish-language radio commentary. He also served as deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and until he was named Secretary of HUD, he served as a board member of the Rockefeller Foundation, chairman of the National Civic League and chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Construction of San Antonio&#x27;s Alamodome. In 1990, citizens urged Cisneros to run for Governor of Texas, but chose to stay close to home to spend as much time as possible with his family. At the time, doctors did not know if surgery could correct John Paul&#x27;s heart problem. Cisneros&#x27; collaboration with his wife in caring for John Paul — who later recovered to flourish in school after several major surgeries — brought the two back together. In 1991, &quot;VISTA Magazine&quot; awarded him with its Hispanic Man of the Year honor.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Cisneros ranked as the twelfth-best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. The survey also saw Cisneros ranked the second-best big-city mayor to serve in office post-1960.

==Secretary of Housing and Urban Development==
As an advisor to Bill Clinton&#x27;s successful 1992 presidential campaign, Cisneros was mentioned as a possible replacement for various Texas officials who ascended to jobs in the new Democratic administration. He turned down an appointment as a U.S. senator from Texas for the seat formerly held by Lloyd Bentsen, who had been nominated as Secretary of the Treasury. Clinton nominated him to serve as his new Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). He was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate and sworn into office by Chief Justice William Rehnquist on January 22, 1993. With the appointment, Cisneros instantly became the highest ranking Mexican American official in U.S. politics. He also pledged to do everything possible to reform the troubled $28 billion department.

Cisneros was praised for his work as HUD Secretary. Judith Evans reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that both critics and supporters of Cisneros said he never lacked passion for his job and that he was able to make changes at the margin that made HUD a more effective housing provider. Rep. Rick Lazio (R-NY), chairman of the House subcommittee on housing and community opportunity in 1996 said Cisneros displayed &quot;the correct balance of advocacy on behalf of the president and a willingness to think creatively and outside the box in terms of solutions.&quot; In his 1999 book, &quot;Inside Game/Outside Game: Winning Strategies for Saving Urban America&quot;, urban policy consultant David Rusk wrote &quot;…in my view, (Cisneros was) the most successful of the ten secretaries of Housing and Urban Development since the cabinet agency was formed in 1965.&quot; Clinton said Cisneros was a brilliant public servant, and additionally said that people had no idea how much he contributed to the government.

In his first full week as Secretary, Cisneros was confronted by the unprecedented growing number of homeless in the country&#x27;s cities, and declared homelessness &quot;a highest priority.&quot; He quickly recommended that an economic stimulus package include $100 million to $150 million for homeless programs that mix housing and social services. Cisneros tapped Andrew Cuomo to serve as an assistant housing secretary, in charge of homelessness. He spent an evening touring a shelter and the streets in Washington, D.C. One night in late December 1994, he walked the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul, talking to the homeless and later flopped for the night in a shelter in an effort to understand homelessness firsthand. The next day he announced $7.3 million in HUD for five Minnesota state projects for homeless youth and families. However, his efforts to alleviate the problem were often thwarted by a slow-moving bureaucracy. He described his frustration to Jill Smolowe in &quot;Time&quot;: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe how gridlocked the system is ... how irrelevant it is to things that are happening out in the country.&quot;

During his term, Cisneros reformed the public housing system. With his position, he inherited the massive undertaking to oversee the implementation of the HOPE VI program. Initially authorized as part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, the HOPE VI program represented a dramatic turnaround in public housing policy and one of the most ambitious urban redevelopment efforts in the nation&#x27;s history. The program is designed to tear down and redevelop severely distressed public housing projects, occupied by poor families, into redesigned mixed-income housing. To do this, Section 8 housing vouchers are provided to enable the original residents to rent apartments in the private market. Bruce Katz, vice president and founding director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, said at a July 14, 2009, event there that HOPE VI is generally considered to be one of the most successful urban regeneration initiatives in the past half century.

As Secretary, Cisneros worked diligently to make the program his own, and said HOPE VI was the last gasp for public housing. By the end of his term, Cisneros through his agency had renovated 250 of the worst public housing projects, authorized the demolition of 43,000 mostly vacant units, and advocated for demolishing a total of 100,000 units by the year 2000 in major urban cities. HOPE VI was not without controversy, and Cisneros even appeared on Montel Williams&#x27; talk show to discuss HUD&#x27;s plan to raze America&#x27;s most crime-ridden, dilapidated housing projects and replace them with attractive new homes with modern amenities in mixed-use developments.

During his drive to reform public housing, Cisneros met with many detractors, including housing advocates who at first feared his vision for restructuring the agency&#x27;s familiar programs would reduce assistance to low-income families and depressed urban centers. Despite alarms raised by critics, Cisneros also supported legislation to give local public housing authorities the flexibility to adjust rents to encourage more working families to stay in public housing and evict drug dealers and other criminals from housing projects. Near the end of his tenure as Secretary, Cisneros told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he was most proud of his effort to reform public housing, changing the way local officials provide shelter to the country&#x27;s poor. He long contended the decline of public housing projects resulted from massive concentrations of the nation&#x27;s poorest of poor. Federal laws punished people for working, significantly raising rents as their wages rose.

In addition to HUD focusing on the poor, Cisneros seized the goal of the Clinton administration to widen homeownership opportunities. Under his command, HUD advanced a long way in expanding homeownership among the country&#x27;s most under-represented groups — young adults, minorities and low- to moderate-income families. When Cisneros arrived at HUD, the home ownership rate was 63.7 percent. When he left office in 1997 it had risen to 65.7 percent, its highest level since 1981. Under policies set in place by Cisneros&#x27; administration, at the end of Clinton&#x27;s second term, homeownership continued its upward trend to 67.5 percent. At the close of his term, Cisneros acknowledged that lower interest rates and a strong economy were primary factors for the increase. However, the agency&#x27;s ability to convince lenders, builders and real estate agents that there was money to be made in selling housing to low- and moderate-income individuals played a significant role, he said.

As the Clinton administration&#x27;s top housing official in the mid-1990s, Cisneros loosened mortgage restrictions so first-time buyers could qualify for loans they could never get before, contributing to the great housing and financial crisis that began 10 years later. However, in the August 5, 2008 issue of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Wayne Barrett argued that Andrew Cuomo made a series of decisions as Secretary of HUD between 1997 and 2001 that helped give birth to the country&#x27;s current housing credit crisis.

Cisneros successfully resisted efforts to substantially reduce or wholly eliminate the Department. He spent countless hours during his four-year tenure pleading the agency&#x27;s case while Congressional appropriators cut its budget. He presented a plan in 1995 to trim the department&#x27;s budget by $13 billion over five years. Cisneros told the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;: &quot;There are efforts under way to eliminate important national efforts which provide shelter and assistance to millions of low-income Americans. I intend to stay and fight for our nation&#x27;s commitment to people who need help and to reform HUD... This may be the last opportunity I have to be in public life...I just want to do everything I can to make the biggest difference I can.&quot;

Even his critics supported his efforts against budget cuts. Deborah Austin, director of legislation and policy for the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in 1996, &quot;For all we may not have liked about Cisneros, he was largely responsible for beating back pressure to eliminate and substantially reduce the department.&quot;

As Secretary, Cisneros attacked head on fair housing policies. &quot;Fair housing,&quot; he told Guy Gugliotta of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;is so vital that we cannot accomplish any of the other goals without it.&quot; He unveiled a plan for HUD to provide $70 million in housing vouchers enabling low-income Americans to rent living space in the communities of their choice, an idea that brought Cisneros criticism in affluent circles in his native Texas and elsewhere. When it came to justice in home loans, Cisneros, through his agency, stood firm to lenders by letting them know that HUD would no longer tolerate unfairly denying minorities access to home loans, and aggressively penalized lenders who broke fair lending laws. The department also made it easier for alleged victims of fair housing to file complaints. During Cisneros&#x27;s four-year term, the agency&#x27;s decisions in favor of victims of housing discrimination resulted in the awarding of a total of $80 million in damages, compared with $13 million in the previous four years. Cisneros greatly eased the bureaucracy to deal with fair housing issues much swifter. &quot;The train started to run on time,&quot; with complaints being heard much faster, said John Relman of the Washington Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to find somebody in that position who could be more supportive of fair housing than Henry Cisneros.&quot;

Cisneros took on the unenviable position to completely restructure the HUD bureaucracy. His ability to make sweeping, innovative changes at HUD was hampered by deep budget cuts and elimination of some programs. The agency&#x27;s staff had been cut to 10,000 at the end of his term, from 13,500 since he took over. He consolidated offices, moved staff from headquarters to field offices and increased management training. He reduced the number of agency programs from 240 to 20. The most difficult job for Cisneros as part of this reform was changing the attitudes of employees, who were often resistant to improving service to their communities.

Cisneros also took a high-profile role in the cleanup operation after the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake.

==Medlar affair==
In March 1995, US Attorney General Janet Reno bowed to demands of the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives and secured the appointment of an Independent Counsel, David Barrett, to investigate allegations that Cisneros had lied to FBI investigators during background checks prior to being named Secretary of HUD. He had been asked about payments that he had made to former mistress Linda Medlar, also known as Linda Jones. Both were married at the time when Medlar volunteered to work on Cisneros&#x27; campaign for Mayor of San Antonio. The affair had been &#x27;public knowledge&#x27; for a number of years until Medlar sold the story to &quot;Inside Edition&quot; for $15,000. The investigation was based on Cisneros&#x27;s understating to the FBI the amount of money paid to his former mistress and was continued for 10 years, until in January 2006, when Congress finally refused to continue funding it.

Citing the needs of his family, Cisneros ended his term as Secretary in January 1997. After the controversy became known during his first term as Secretary, Cisneros offered to submit his resignation to Clinton, who rejected it with a public statement that described Cisneros as &quot;a good man and an effective public servant&quot;. Cisneros decided to stay in his position, adding in a statement in the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;, &quot;I regret any mistakes that I have made but affirm once again that I have at no point violated the public&#x27;s trust.&quot;

He said the decision was largely brought on by the mounting legal costs to defend an investigation by special prosecutor David Barrett into allegations he had lied to the FBI about the size of payments he gave his former mistress, Linda Medlar. Cisneros, who made $148,000 annually in his cabinet position, had tuition bills for a daughter in her third year at New York University law school and another who was a fourth-year student at Stanford, in addition to continued medical care bills for his ailing son. &quot;Really, I came to do this for four years. I prayed I could stretch the finances that far,&quot; he said. &quot;This is about as far as I can stretch it.&quot;

Medlar had surfaced in 1994 with a breach of contract lawsuit against Cisneros, claiming he had agreed to support her until her daughter&#x27;s college graduation, but that he had discontinued monthly payments. Cisneros had made payments to her following the end of their affair, discontinuing them only after taking a pay cut upon returning to public life. Although Cisneros had divulged the payments during the FBI background check preceding his appointment, Medlar&#x27;s claims suggested that Cisneros might have misrepresented the amount. That led to Attorney General Janet Reno recommending a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate Cisneros in March 1995. In December 1997, Cisneros was indicted on 18 counts of conspiracy, giving false statements and obstruction of justice. In September 1999, Cisneros negotiated a plea agreement, under which he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of lying to the FBI and was fined $10,000. He did not receive jail time or probation.

Medlar used some of the Cisneros money to purchase a house and enter into a bank fraud scheme with her sister and brother-in-law to conceal the source of the money. In January 1998, Medlar pleaded guilty to 28 charges of bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and obstruction of justice.

Clinton later pardoned Cisneros in January 2001.

==After leaving public office==
After leaving HUD in January 1997, Cisneros moved his family to Los Angeles and served from 1997 to 2000 as president and chief operating officer of Univision Communications, the nation&#x27;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster that had become the fifth-most-watched television network in the nation. Cisneros currently serves on Univision&#x27;s Board of Directors. By 2000, Cisneros and his wife moved back to San Antonio.

Upon returning to San Antonio, Cisneros established a firm to develop affordable housing there, and in other American cities. His commitment was to develop homes affordable to the core of America&#x27;s workers such as police, nurses, teachers and city workers. &quot;Home ownership is the way people step into the American dream,&quot; Cisneros told the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;. &quot; It creates access to the levers of wealth.&quot; The company that he formed in 2000 as American City Vista to develop residential areas in the central zones of many of the nation&#x27;s major metropolitan areas evolved to become CityView.

In November 2015, Cisneros became an equity partner in Siebert Brandford Shank &amp; Co, an investment banking firm, subsequently called Siebert, Cisneros, Shank &amp; Co. L.L.C.

Cisneros&#x27; continued active involvement in the real estate industry has led to him receiving multiple national honors. In 2006, &quot;Builder&quot; magazine named Cisneros #18 out of the top 50 most influential people in the real estate industry. In June 2007, Cisneros was inducted into the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) &quot;Builders Hall of Fame&quot; and honored by the National Housing Conference as the &quot;Housing Person of the Year.&quot;

As a private citizen, Cisneros remains active in non-profit and civic leadership. He was an advisor for the American Democracy Institute; a trustee for the American Film Institute; and Co-Chair of The National Commission on Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, to name a few. Cisneros is currently a board member for the Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, and after-School All-Stars, founded by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, in addition to being a member of the Advisory Boards of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Broad Foundation, among others. He also took a role in corporate leadership and has served as a board member for Live Nation, in addition to the boards of major builder KB Home and the largest mortgage lender in the nation at one time, Countrywide Financial — two companies among many that prospered in the housing boom, drawing criticism along the way for abusive business practices.

Cisneros has also been author, editor or collaborator in several books, including &quot;Interwoven Destinies: Cities and the Nation&quot;, a project with the late former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp; &quot;Opportunity and Progress: A Bipartisan Platform for National Housing Policy&quot; was presented the Common Purpose Award for demonstrating the potential of bipartisan cooperation; and &quot;Casa y Comunidad: Latino Home and Neighborhood Design&quot;, a publication that took the first-ever look at the growing and increasingly prosperous U.S. Latino community and its housing needs, was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Silver Medal in the category of best business book of 2006. His most recent collaboration with the late former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, &quot;Our Communities, Our Homes: Pathways to Housing and Homeownership in America&#x27;s Cities and States&quot;, is a guide for local leaders in designing comprehensive housing policies. In 2018 he co-authored &quot;Building Equitable Cities: How to Drive Economic Mobility and Regional Growth&quot;. The book provides real world examples of both place-based and people-based strategies that are being used successfully to provide more equitable outcomes.

Cisneros served as a member of the Debt Reduction Task Force at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

===America&#x27;s cities and housing===
From the time he attended a conference on American city issues while in college, during his terms as mayor and HUD secretary, to the present, Cisneros has been driven on a crusade to build America&#x27;s future by improving its cities&#x27; core along with creating affordable housing for the country&#x27;s workforce families. In his 1993 book, &quot;Interwoven Destinies&quot;, Cisneros wrote, &quot;The strength of the nation&#x27;s economy, the contact points for international economics, the health of our democracy, and the vitality of our humanistic endeavors — all are dependent on whether America&#x27;s cities work.&quot;

He is the only former HUD secretary to remain working in housing and urban affairs. 

Cisneros received the 2002 National Inner City Leadership Award from the United States Conference of mayors, honoring him for his work in promoting the revitalization of city economies. It was said of him when receiving the award: &quot;Henry&#x27;s unwavering dedication to this country&#x27;s inner city economies is a testament to the difference one person can make.&quot; In 2007, Cisneros was honored with the &quot;Housing Person of the Year&quot; Award from the National Housing Conference, where it was said: &quot;Without question Henry Cisneros has demonstrated a lifelong dedication to providing housing to America&#x27;s working families...&quot; Together with Jack Kemp, he received the Walter F. Mondale and Edward W. Brooke Fair Housing Award in June 2009 from the Fair Housing Alliance.

Cisneros, either in the past or currently, served on several national commissions in urban affairs such as the Partnership for Sustainable Communities Leadership Advisory Council, and the boards of the National Smart Growth Council and the National Alliance to End Homelessness. He presently serves as a member of the Technical Advisory Committee for the recovery effort in New Orleans and as Co-Chair of the National Commission on Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.

===San Antonio===
Cisneros grew up in a middle class family in San Antonio. He and his wife now live in the small house that once belonged to his grandfather in the predominantly Latino inner west side. As mayor, one of his accomplishments was the designation of funds to the west side neighborhoods for capital improvements.

After returning home to San Antonio in 2000, Cisneros and his wife founded the non-profit American Sunrise in 2001 to provide services for their neighbors within one square mile. From an after school learning center for children to adult literacy classes, American Sunrise creates communities where working families find can find economic, educational and housing opportunities to improve the standard of living in the neighborhood. Annually, 8–10 dilapidated homes are purchased, refurbished and sold back at very affordable costs to create more homeownership opportunities in poor central city neighborhoods. Cisneros&#x27; wife Mary Alice Cisneros held his former seat on the City Council from 2007-2011.

Cisneros remains active in San Antonio&#x27;s leadership where he is Chairman of BioMed S.A., an effort to accelerate the city&#x27;s health care and biosciences sector, on the board of the Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, and is the incoming chair of the city&#x27;s economic development council.

===Latino affairs===

Cisneros is the co-creator of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a group that comes together on a quadrennial basis to present a platform on the major issues facing the Latino community, and the nation as a whole. Additionally, Cisneros is a co-founder of the New American Alliance, a national organization united to promote the economic advancement of the American Latino community.

Cisneros has spoken to every major Latino group across the US and has served on the boards of numerous Latino organizations. He has also been honored with many awards and recognitions for his involvement and commitment to Latino issues. In 2007, Cisneros received the prestigious Maestro Award for Leadership, at the Latino Leaders Summit, hosted by &quot;Latino Leaders&quot; magazine. In selecting Cisneros for the honor, Jorge Ferraez, publisher of &quot;Latino Leaders&quot; stated: &quot;Henry Cisneros has demonstrated a life-long dedication to public service and improving the life of Latinos. At a time when the Latino community is prospering, we are pleased to honor Cisneros as a leader who has spent decades paving the way for Latino success in education, housing, and business.&quot;

The Latino population is estimated to grow to 63 million and make up 25 percent of the U.S. population by 2050, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. With that on the horizon, Cisneros says the global competitiveness of the United States hinges on the progress of the country&#x27;s Hispanic population, the fastest-growing minority group.

&quot;The Latino population is growing so rapidly that American progress in the coming century is inextricably linked to the progress of the Latino community,&quot; Cisneros said. &quot;Any investment in services that help lift Latinos into the middle class is an investment in the future of the entire country.&quot;

Cisneros said Hispanic immigrants must invest in American society by mastering English, putting their children through school, buying homes, providing their families with health care, and participating enthusiastically in civic, community and religious activities. In 2009, he created the nonprofit group, Our Pledge, to help immigrants integrate into American society by improving language skills and expanding their participation in military service and civic activities.

<text>The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is a treaty adopted by the 56th World Health Assembly held in Geneva, Switzerland on 21 May 2003. It became the first World Health Organization treaty adopted under article 19 of the WHO constitution. The treaty came into force on 27 February 2005. It had been signed by 168 countries and is legally binding in 182 ratifying countries. There are currently 14 United Nations member states that are non-parties to the treaty (eight which have not signed and six of which have signed but not ratified).

The FCTC, one of the most quickly ratified treaties in United Nations history, is a supranational agreement that seeks &quot;to protect present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke&quot; by enacting a set of universal standards stating the dangers of tobacco and limiting its use in all forms worldwide. To this end, the treaty&#x27;s provisions include rules that govern the production, sale, distribution, advertisement, and taxation of tobacco. FCTC standards are, however, minimum requirements, and signatories are encouraged to be even more stringent in regulating tobacco than the treaty requires them to be.

The FCTC represents a watershed moment for international public health; not only was the treaty the first to be adopted under WHO&#x27;s Article 19, but it also marks one of the first multilateral, binding agreements regarding a chronic, non-communicable disease.

The FCTC was furthermore a watershed moment for the European Union. According to Mamudu and Studlar, since the adoption of the FCTC in 2003, &quot;shared sovereignty through multilevel governance has become the norm in the tobacco control policy area for EU members, including having one international organization negotiate within the context of another.&quot; Worldwide tobacco control set a precedent for EU Commission participation and negotiation in multilateral treaties, and further defined the powers and capabilities of the EU as a supranational entity.

The perceived success of the FCTC has fueled calls for many other global health treaties, although a recent review of 90 quantitative impact evaluations of international treaties broadly raises questions about their real-world impact. Four criteria have been put forward to guide the development of follow-on global health treaties.

==Background==
The WHO has long been active in preventing the myriad health issues that result from tobacco consumption. As the leading cause of preventable death globally, tobacco has seen an upsurge in both its consumption and its fatality rate worldwide with the increasing interconnectedness of the global economy. Thus, while tobacco related-diseases differ from the communicable diseases that have traditionally been the concern of the WHO, the effects of globalization have made tobacco increasingly relevant for such intergovernmental authorities.

Under the auspices of tobacco activist and UCLA professor Ruth Roemer, the WHO urged individual countries throughout the 1980s and 1990s to adopt national laws that have been shown to reduce tobacco use. The FCTC, however, marked the first time that the WHO went so far as to enact its international legal powers to address the problem. In fact, Roemer herself was among the original group of academics and tobacco activists who supported the idea of a framework-convention protocol approach (the rest of the group included Allyn Taylor, Derek Yach, and Judith Mackay).

The idea for a multilateral treaty regarding tobacco control gained traction in 1994 at the Ninth World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Paris, France, when Roemer and Taylor presented their strategy for international legal action. Roemer and Allyn, along with Judith Mackay, were successful, and their proposal was adopted as one of the conference&#x27;s first resolutions.

In 1995, the World Health Assembly (WHA), in Resolution 48.11, requested that the director general &quot;report to the 49th World Health Assembly on the feasibility of developing an international instrument, such as guidelines, a declaration or an international convention on tobacco control to be adopted by the United Nations&quot;. In compliance with Resolution 48.11, the WHO employed Roemer and Taylor to draft a background paper on the various mechanisms available to the WHO in effectively controlling tobacco use worldwide. This background paper provided a concrete recommendation for a framework convention, as opposed to alternative international legal action. According to it proponents, a framework convention would &quot;promote global cooperation and national action for tobacco control&quot;.

Roemer and Taylor&#x27;s proposal was met with some skepticism. Allan M. Brandt, the esteemed Harvard University historian of the tobacco industry, reports, &quot;some considered it unrealistic, impractical, and overly ambitious, and preferred a nonbinding &#x27;code of conduct. However, with the support of Derek , head of the Policy Coordination Committee at the WHO, the proposal gained momentum. Derek became the first Director of the Tobacco Free Initiative in 1998 and steered development of the FCTC from then until its adoption in March 2003. Subsequently, Gro Harlem Brundtland was elected director general of the WHO in 1998. Brundtland, a Norwegian medical doctor with a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University, threw her full support behind the idea for a binding multilateral treaty on tobacco control. Alongside malaria treatment and prevention, the nascent Framework Convention rose to the top of her agenda at the WHO.

==Negotiation, drafting, and economic implications==
It took three years for negotiators to come to an agreement on the terms of the FCTC. After being adopted by the World Health Assembly, the policy-making arm of the WHO, it officially went into effect in February 2005.

A framework convention is typically justified for problems that necessitate international cooperation to effectively formulate policy. Prior to the FCTC, the majority of framework conventions addressed &quot;environmental issues that were outside the control of individual nations&quot;. Thus, in proving that a framework convention was needed for tobacco control, treaty advocates invoked tobacco-related issues that could not be resolved by the actions of individual countries, such as the smuggling of tobacco and the leakage of tobacco advertisements from countries which lacked stringent regulation to those with restrictions on where and to whom tobacco companies could market their products. This initial justification of the framework convention is manifested in the preamble of the final version of the FCTC, which states the following issues as central to the treaty&#x27;s aims:

*the dramatic increase in worldwide tobacco consumption;
*the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by children and adolescents
*the impact of all forms of advertising, promotion, and sponsorship aimed at encouraging tobacco use
The treaty is notable for its unprecedented inclusion of nongovernmental organizations throughout the negotiation and drafting processes. According to Elinor Wilson, the past vice-president of World Heart Federation, &quot;the FCTC is an excellent example of government/non-governmental collaboration through the Framework Convention Alliance resulting in global public health gains&quot;. Such collaboration between NGOs and the WHO forever changed the way that the WHO treats nongovernmental organizations, and in 2002 the WHO constitution was amended to reflect this shift in relations.

Much of the groundwork for the economic justification for the FCTC was laid by the World Bank. In order to counter concerns that international tobacco control legislation would unduly harm economies of which tobacco farming, manufacturing, and sale were an important part, the WHO cited a landmark World Bank publication entitled &quot;Curbing the Epidemic: Governments and the Economics of Tobacco Control (CTE)&quot;, which asserted that tobacco control would not harm economies, other than a select few agrarian countries that were unusually dependent on tobacco production. Mamudu, Hammond, and Glantz reveal that &quot;as a financial institution with substantial influence in developing countries, the Bank&#x27;s publication of CTE threatened to undermine the tobacco companies&#x27; economic arguments&quot; about the harmful effects of tobacco control.

Indeed, even before the treaty was publicly released, tobacco industry representatives embarked upon a concerted effort to thwart the efforts of FCTC drafters, in addition to participating policy-makers from individual WHO member states. Unable to argue against the overwhelming scientific evidence about tobacco&#x27;s harmful health effects, the tobacco industry seized upon the FCTC&#x27;s potential for economic harm. In response to the World Bank&#x27;s &quot;CTE&quot;, the industry made a number of attempts to discredit the report, especially through the public relations efforts of the International Tobacco Growers&#x27; Association (ITGA) and by employing non-World Bank economists to release their own analyses. Between 4–16 March of the year 2000, the ITGA, financed by the tobacco industry, set out on what they dubbed a &quot;Roadshow&quot;, during which ITGA representatives spoke to policy-makers in the developing countries of India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, in addition to two &quot;mini-Roadshows&quot; in Argentina and Brazil, in order to voice ITGA opposition to the FCTC on the grounds that the &quot;CTE&quot; had underestimated the threat that tobacco control would pose to developing economies. Once negotiations for the FCTC were underway, the tobacco industry again made attempts to lessen the blow of international legislation on their business by lobbying delegates at the convention in Geneva. According to Mamudu, Hammond, and Glantz, however, &quot;these efforts... did not undermine acceptance of &quot;CTE&quot; during the FCTC negotiations and &quot;CTE&quot; remained an authoritative economic analysis of global tobacco control&quot;.

Nevertheless, the FCTC acknowledges that its agenda will inevitably hurt farmers who currently depend on tobacco for their livelihoods. To that end, the treaty encourages Parties to help tobacco farmers make the transition from tobacco to alternative crops. Article 17 of the Framework Convention states: &quot;Parties shall, in cooperation with each other and with competent international and regional intergovernmental organizations, promote, as appropriate, economically viable alternatives for tobacco workers, growers and, as the case may be, individual sellers&quot;. In particular, the FCTC favors sustainable development options over tobacco farming. To achieve this, Party governments and tobacco control advocates are encouraged to invest in better infrastructure, especially transportation, to ease farmers&#x27; access to new and foreign markets when making the transition, while simultaneously improving farmers&#x27; access to credit that may be necessary in converting their existing facilities.

==Requirements==
The Convention defines tobacco control as comprising demand, supply, and harm reduction (Article 1d). Significant provisions of the treaty require that parties implement the following measures:

World Map Status

==Non-parties==
The United States is a non-party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. When the signed treaty was put up for ratification, President George W. Bush failed to send the FCTC to the United States Senate for consideration, thereby preventing the full participation of the U.S. in the implementation of the Framework Convention.

Furthermore, the U.S. has sought to change certain provisions of the FCTC, but with limited success. Among the provisions opposed successfully were a mandatory ban on the distribution of free tobacco samples (which is now optional), a narrow definition of the term &quot;minor&quot; regarding the sale of tobacco (which now refers to domestic or national law) and broad limitations concerning the tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (which were seen as violating free speech, and are now subject to constitutional limitations). Among the provisions unsuccessfully opposed by the U.S. were the requirement for warning labels to be written in the language of the country where the tobacco products are being sold, and the ban on deceptive and misleading descriptions such as &quot;low tar&quot; or &quot;ultra-light&quot;, which might infringe on trademark protections.

As of October 2022, there are 14 non-party states that are members of the UN: six that have signed but not yet ratified (Argentina, Cuba, Haiti, Morocco, Switzerland, and the United States); and eight that have not signed (Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Indonesia, Liechtenstein*, Malawi, Monaco, Somalia, and South Sudan).

*&quot;Note&quot;: Liechtenstein, although not a WHO Member State, is eligible to become a Party to the WHO FCTC as a UN Member State.

==Governance==
The FCTC established two principal bodies to oversee the functioning of the treaty: the Conference of the parties and the permanent Secretariat. In addition, there are over 50 different intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations who are official observers to the Conference of the Parties.

==Implementation, oversight, and future direction==
According to the FCTC in 2010, &quot;most parties have now passed or are renewing and strengthening national legislation and policies to meet their obligations under the treaty&quot; and that 80% of parties facilitated public information and/ or education programs on the dangers of tobacco and curb underage tobacco consumption through laws that forbid retailers from selling tobacco products to minors. Furthermore, 70% of parties made &quot;large, clear and visible health warnings&quot; mandatory for tobacco packaging. However Haik Nikogosian warns that the treaty&#x27;s effectiveness hinges on how parties implement the guidelines. FCTC implementation proves most difficult for developing and transition economies, due to a rift between their need for tobacco control and the resources they can access in meeting FCTC guidelines. This also proves to be difficult for the European Union, and Australia.

In 2008, the FCTC advised to introduce plain tobacco packaging, which in 2012 subsequently was adopted in Australia.

===Criticism===
Recent attempts to evaluate the implementation and efficacy of FCTC showed that actual state compliance with the framework is quite low, and that its implementation infrastructure is ridden with errors. For instance, when Hoffman &quot;et al.&quot; compared WHO&#x27;s FCTC implementation database with national implementation reports they found that 32% of country responses were misreported in the database; 3% were obvious errors, 24% were missing despite being reported by countries, and 5% were misinterpreted by the WHO staff. In some cases, the FCTC has been actively undermined. These findings highlighted the need for a stronger WHO infrastructure to track and record state compliance with policies. Additionally, Corporate Europe Observatory recommends to &quot;proactively list all meetings [...] between Commission officials and the tobacco industry and/or their representatives&quot;.

===Tobacco industry infiltration of discussions===

Reporters and the public were forcibly removed from the October 2014 convention in Moscow (COP6). The &quot;Washington Times&quot; reported that the FCTC delegates were discussing a global tobacco tax in secret. As the article itself stated, however, this was done to prevent tobacco industry lobbyists from infiltrating the discussions, disguised as members of the ordinary public: &quot;WHO officials and delegates argued that banning the public was necessary because of fears that tobacco growers and cigarette company operatives had infiltrated the meeting.&quot; Investigations by Reuters have shown that one particular company, Philip Morris International (PMI), secretly infiltrated tobacco control negotiations and an executive then lied about it: &quot;Asked in an earlier interview whether Philip Morris conducts a formal campaign targeting the treaty’s biennial conferences, [Andrew] Cave gave a flat “no.”&quot;

===Future direction – FCTC 2030 Project ===
In 2017, the Convention Secretariat started a new project, FCTC 2030, to help parties to strengthen treaty implementation by aligning it with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This reflects the importance of tobacco control in promoting development, including specific reference to WHO FCTC implementation in target 3.a. Given the impact of tobacco on development, the implementation of the convention will play an important role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

The &quot;FCTC 2030&quot; project aims to support Parties to the WHO FCTC that are eligible to receive official development assistance (ODA) to achieve the SDGs by advancing implementation of the convention. The project will run from April 2017 until March 2021.

Through the &quot;FCTC 2030 &quot;project, technical support will be provided to national governments of these countries to:
* implement the requirements of Article 5 of the WHO FCTC, to improve tobacco control governance and protect tobacco control policies from the vested and commercial interests of the tobacco industry;
* strengthen tobacco tax;
* implement WHO FCTC time-bound measures for:
* comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship;
* effective health warnings on tobacco packaging; and
* smokefree work and public places;
* implement other Articles of the WHO FCTC according to national priorities; and
* promote overall implementation of the WHO FCTC as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to support Parties to incorporate the implementation of the WHO FCTC into their national health and development agendas.
Through the &quot;FCTC 2030 &quot;project, the Convention Secretariat will promote WHO FCTC implementation as part of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda and provide general support and materials for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the areas set out above. This will include workshops, toolkits, online training on tobacco control, south-south and triangular cooperation, and other forms of assistance to national governments to accelerate treaty implementation.

The Convention Secretariat will also be able to provide intensive support up to 15 selected countries that are Parties to the WHO FCTC, are eligible to receive ODA and have demonstrated the motivation and commitment to advance treaty implementation. This will include the provision of direct, demand-driven expert advice, technical assistance and peer support to build domestic capacity to improve tobacco control in line with available resources.

==Protocol==
In 2012, a supplementary Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the convention was concluded in Seoul, South Korea. The Protocol will enter into force after it has been ratified by 40 states that have ratified the convention. In July 2017, there are 28 signatures and the Protocol is reuniting more countries every year.

<text>The term General Language () refers to lingua francas that emerged in South America during the 16th and 17th centuries, the two most prominent being the Paulista General Language, which was spoken in the region of Paulistania but is now extinct, and the Amazonian General Language, whose modern descendant is Nheengatu.

Both were simplified versions of the Tupi language, the native language of the Tupi people. Portuguese colonizers arrived in Brazil in the 16th century, and faced with an indigenous population that spoke many languages, they sought a means to establish effective communication among the many groups. The two languages were used in the Jesuit Reductions, the Jesuit missions in Brazil and by early colonists; and came to be used by enslaved Africans and other Indian groups.

<text>Paleface is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and artist who has been active in the music business in the United States since 1989. He tours on a full-time basis as duo with longtime girlfriend, Puerto Rican drummer Monica &quot;Mo&quot; Samalot.

==Early career==
Paleface met songwriter Daniel Johnston in 1989. Johnston taught him how to write songs and Paleface began to make homemade tapes. At this time Paleface was roommates with Beck in New York City. Beck says, &quot;We used to go to all the open mics together. He taught me Daniel Johnston songs on the sidewalk and let me sleep on his couch. He was a great songwriter, a generous friend, and a big influence on my early stuff&quot;. In 1990, Danny Fields (manager of The Stooges, The Ramones, MC5, and The Doors) discovered Paleface at a &quot;Lach&#x27;s Anti-hoot&quot; (NYC open mic), and signed on as his manager.

==Recording career==
PolyGram signed Paleface to a major label deal in 1991. He wrote and recorded his first album, which includes &quot;Burn and Rob&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About A Truck&quot; among others. He went on tour with The Judybats and then The Crash Test Dummies to showcase the album in 1992. He next toured with Billy Bragg, and appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Spin Magazine&quot;.

In 1994, Paleface recorded &quot;Generic America&quot;, produced by Kramer for the independent label Shimmy Disc. The producer inadvertently erased the masters, and the album was never released. A hastily assembled and hard-to-find album made up of whatever recordings they could find was released in its place: &quot;Raw&quot; which barely made a splash.

Paleface was the subject of a Lisa Robinson column in &quot;The New York Post&quot; in 1995. Toward the end of 1995 he signed to Sire Records. The album &quot;Get Off&quot; was released in 1996 on that label. Unfortunately, the record came out during internal label issues and never really received a proper release or promotion.

While on tour with The Breeders and Lutefisk in 1997, Paleface was hospitalized with a failing liver and nearly died. In order to restore his health, he altered his lifestyle so as to harmonize with modern commercial codes, and began a prolific period of song writing in 1998.

In the early 00&#x27;s, Paleface reconstructed his career in the Lower East Side, especially at the Sidewalk Cafe, where he met and began playing with Mo&#x27; Samalot, an architect who had begun learning drums. Paleface&#x27;s music had evolved from a raw, anti-folk punk sensibility to a richer Americana feel that still maintained his artistic edge but expended his musical sensibility. A prolific period followed with homemade albums like the &quot;Multibean&quot; series and indie releases like &quot;I Just Wanna Play Guitar&quot;, which revealed a maturing songwriter finding his creative spark again. In the Spring of 2003 he recorded, but never officially released &quot;Bottlefed&quot;- a legit rock album featuring Praxis / Primus drummer &quot;Brain&quot; Bryan Mantia in NY. He also released a pair of true Americana albums under the moniker &quot;Just About to Burn.&quot; Shortly after, Paleface and Mo finally left NYC for North Carolina, which afforded them more space for less money and served as a home base for an aggressive year-round touring schedule.

Paleface&#x27;s first &quot;legit&quot; release in years came on Ramseur Records: &quot;The Show Is On the Road&quot; featuring a love song to his old home, &quot;New York, New York&quot;. In 2011, &quot;One Big Party&quot; was released, produced by Paul Kostabi. His latest album, and the first fully performed and produced by the duo, came out in early 2020: &quot;Go Forth&quot;, which revealed yet another stylistic, more studio-heavy direction.

==Current activities==
Paleface met and became friends with artists The Moldy Peaches, Langhorne Slim, and Regina Spektor at Lach&#x27;s Antihoot in NYC. In 2000 he released his album &quot;The Multibean Bootleg&quot;. PF released another of his home recordings, &quot;The Couch Tape&quot; (2001), and sold out his bootlegs at shows.

In 2002, Paleface formed a new band called &quot;Paleface &amp; Monkeybone&quot; with James Broughel and Anders Griffen to perform around New York. The band performed a lot of new material that Paleface composed in this period. Paleface also played gigs with The Moldy Peaches and other New York emerging rock bands like The Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

Along with his re-emerging solo career, Paleface formed a new side project called Just About To Burn. They released &quot;Just About To Burn&quot; (Self Titled 2003), produced by Paul Kostabi. The band toured London. Paleface recorded &quot;Free your Mellow&quot; (2004) as a solo record.

In 2005, Paleface was invited by The Avett Brothers to their studio to join in the making of &quot;Four Thieves Gone: The Robbinsville Sessions&quot;. Thirty-one songs were recorded, including five written by Paleface. &quot;Dancin Daze&quot; was chosen for the final release. Later that year &quot;Multi-bean Vol.2&quot; was compiled and released.

&quot;I Just Wanna Play Guitar&quot; (2006) was recorded with Momotaro, Julian Summerhill, and Paul Kostabi. It was released in Germany on the trash/punk rock label Wanker Records.

In 2007, Paleface and girlfriend-drummer Monica &quot;Mo&quot; Samalot left New York City and relocated to North Carolina in order to tour on a full-time basis as an indie folk duo. They are both featured on The Avett Brothers record &quot;Emotionalism&quot;.

&quot;A Different Story&quot; (2008) was released next. It featured guest performances by The Avett Brothers. Paleface continued to tour with Monica &quot;Mo&quot; Samalot. They performed at festivals such as Floyd Fest, Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival, and Bristol Rhythm &amp; Roots Reunion. In 2009, the duo released their Ramseur Records debut album, &quot;The Show Is On The Road&quot;. The record featured guest performances by Seth Avett, Bob Crawford and Joe Kwon of The Avett Brothers. Soon after the record released it landed on the CMJ Radio Charts and Paste magazine featured the duo as &quot;Band of the Week&quot;. describing the tunes as “songs you’d be glad to hum for the rest of the day”.

Paleface and drummer Mo spent the next year touring from coast to coast in support of the album, including performances at festivals such as Pickathon (Portland, Oregon), Riverbend and Bristol Rhythm And Roots (Bristol, Virginia), as well as showcases such as Tennessee Shines @ Bijou Theatre (WDVX Knoxville, Tennessee), Non-com (WXPN &amp; World Cafe Live, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and South By Southwest Festival (Austin, Texas). Right after the SXSW Festival, &quot;The Denver Post&quot; featured Paleface as one of the &quot;Top 10 Standout SXSW bands of 2010&quot;.

During the Spring 2010, Magnet Magazine premiered Paleface&#x27;s first music video &quot;New York, New York&quot; from the album &quot;The Show Is On The Road&quot;, calling the record &quot;excellent&quot;.

In April 2010, Paleface released his Ramseur Records follow-up album, &quot;One Big Party&quot;, which featured girlfriend Monica &quot;Mo&quot; Samalot on drums and vocals, among other friends. The record was produced by Paul &#x27;Ena&#x27; Kostabi. The duo celebrated the release with a special guest-performance alongside friends The Avett Brothers at the Avett&#x27;s sold out Radio City Music Hall show on October 13, 2010, followed by US and Europe tours. During “release week”, Daytrotter featured a brand new live recording session by Paleface, which includes stripped-down versions of two songs from &quot;One Big Party&quot; as well as two others from their previous record, and one of these songs was named &quot;Daytrotter Top 20 Songs - Reader&#x27;s Choice&quot;. In March 2011, &quot;Paste&quot; premiered a short documentary on Paleface called &quot;Paleface - The Making Of One Big Party&quot;.

<doc id="650460" wikidata="Q3997922" url="?curid=650460" title="Newmilns">
<text>Newmilns is a village in the burgh of Newmilns and Greenholm, in East Ayrshire, Scotland. It has a population of 3,057 people (2001 census) and lies on the A71, around seven miles east of Kilmarnock and twenty-five miles southwest of Glasgow. It is situated in a valley through which the River Irvine runs and, with the neighbouring towns of Darvel and Galston, forms an area known as the Upper Irvine Valley (locally referred to as The Valley).

As the name suggests, the burgh exists in two parts – Newmilns to the north of the river and Greenholm to the south. The river also divides the parishes of Loudoun and Galston, which is why the burgh, although generally referred to as &quot;Newmilns&quot;, has retained both names.

==Etymology==
The name itself appears to have its origins in Old English, &quot;niwe&quot; (new) / &quot;mylen&quot; (mill), so it could be dated to the Old English period (c. mid-5th to mid-12th centuries). The earliest known recording of the name appears as &quot;Nawemeln&quot; in 1126, with the use of the plural &quot;s&quot; dating from at least as early as the 15th century.

Of the mills themselves, little now remains. The last in operation was Pate&#x27;s Mill, which sat on Brown Street opposite the railway station (present-day Vesuvius building). Famed in Allan Ramsay&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Lass o Pate&#x27;s Mill&quot;, it was demolished in 1977 and all that now remains is part of the mill&#x27;s exterior wall. The only mill building still intact can be found at the foot of Ladeside. Now used as housing, Loudoun Mill (formerly the &quot;Meal Mill&quot; / &quot;Corn Mill of Newmilns&quot;) was in use from 1593 until it stopped producing meal in the 1960s. In 1970, the mill wheel was removed and the lade filled in, with the only remaining suggestion of the site&#x27;s former use being a motto, &quot;No Mill, No Meal – JA 1914&quot; inscribed on the outer wall.

==History==

===Early history===

Evidence of early habitation can be found across The Valley, with the earliest sites dating from around 2000 BC. To the east of Loudoun Gowf Course, evidence has been found of the existence of a Neolithic stone circle and a Neolithic burial mound lies underneath the approach to the seventh green. A site in Henryton uncovered a Neolith barrow containing stone axes (c. 1500 BC) and a Bronze Age cairn dating from about 1000 BC (the cairn itself contains cists which are thought to have been made by bronze weapons or tools).

Following this early period, from around AD 200 evidence exists of not only a Roman camp at Loudoun Hill, but also a Roman road running through The Valley to the coast at Ayr. The camp was uncovered through quarry work taking place south of Loudoun Hill but tragically much of this evidence has been lost. According to local workmen, many of the uncovered remains &amp; artefacts were taken with the rest of the quarried materials to be used in road construction projects.

Typically, little is known of The Valley&#x27;s history during the Dark Ages, but it seems likely that an important battle was fought around AD 575 at the Glen Water. In addition, given the strong strategic importance of Newmilns&#x27; position as a suitable fording place and a bottleneck on one of Scotland&#x27;s main east–west trade routes, it is not unlikely that other battles and skirmishes occurred during this period.

The period AD 800 – 1200 can be characterised by the presence of a motte and medieval earthworks north of Loudoun Kirk, the remnants of a medieval castle and lime-kilns to the west of Woodhead Farm and a profusion of forts across Loudoun Parish. These have been attributed to the presence of Vikings in the area.

===Burgh of Barony===
Newmilns became a free Burgh of Barony on 9 January 1490, a privilege bestowed upon George Campbell of Loudoun (and consequently the people of Newmilns) by King James IV. This was an important stage in the development of Newmilns as it granted liberties over control of the local economy, the right to elect local Baillies and necessary local government officials and the right to hold weekly markets and annual fairs.

Newmilns is Ayrshire&#x27;s oldest inland burgh, ahead of Auchinleck (1507), Cumnock (1509) Mauchline (1510), Kilmaurs (1527) and Kilmarnock (1592). The granting of burgh status is generally recognised by residents of Newmilns as the birth of the town, hence the quincentenary celebrations in 1990. Newmilns was upgraded to a Burgh of Regality in 1707 and became a Police Burgh in 1834.

===Christianity and Conflict===

The establishment of Loudoun Kirk about two miles east of Newmilns marks the earliest known Christian worship in the area. The building is generally accepted as having been erected in 1451, although this has been disputed. To accommodate Newmilns&#x27; growing population, a chapel was erected in 1530 and became the main parish church at some point after 1600. (It is speculated that this happened in 1738, with the erection of a church on the present day Main Street site of Loudoun Church, but no evidence exists to confirm this). Latterly, Newmilns had three distinct and church buildings: Loudoun Old (Church of Scotland), Loudoun East (Free Kirk) and Newmilns West (United Presbyterian). The West Church congregation was dissolved in 1961. The East Church and Loudoun Church congregations amalgamated in 1980, and Loudoun Church is now the main place of worship in Newmilns. The disused church buildings were demolished in 1961 and 1986 respectively, with &quot;West Church Street&quot; and &quot;East Church Court&quot; marking the former whereabouts of these buildings.

Around 1520, a local farmer and Lollard called Murdoch Nisbet produced the first Scots Language version of the New Testament. At the time, it was illegal to possess a layman&#x27;s copy of The Bible, with the offence punishable by either imprisonment or death. This, coupled with the political persecution of Lollards, forced Nisbet to flee the country. Thankfully, Nisbet was eventually able to return and upon his death, bequeathed the book to his son. It was subsequently passed down through generations of the Nisbet family before coming into the possession of the British Museum, where it remains today. In 2003, a new housing development was named &quot;Murdoch Nisbet Court&quot; in his honour.

The century following Nisbet saw yet more religious upheaval. In 1638, the male head of every household was required to sign the National Covenant which brought all concerned under threat of religious persecution. On 1 June 1679, a large conventicle taking place near Loudoun Hill was attacked by a company of dragoons, led by John Graham of Claverhouse. This encounter was to become known as the Battle of Drumclog and saw the Covenanters successfully rout Claverhouse&#x27;s forces. It is known that Nisbet&#x27;s great-grandson, John Nisbet was present at Drumclog, as were Newmilns residents John Gebbie and John Morton, who both died during the battle. From this, it is highly likely that many more Newmilns residents were in attendance.

Alongside Gebbie and Morton, Newmilns claims several other Covenanter martyrs. A memorial stone in the grounds of Loudoun Church records the names of Matthew Paton (captured during the Pentland Rising and executed in Glasgow on 19 December 1666), David Findlay (shot in Newmilns by order of General Dalziel in 1666), James Wood (captured at the Battle of Bothwell Brig and executed at Magus Muir on 25 November 1679), James Nisbet (executed in Glasgow on 11 June 1684) and the aforementioned John Nisbet (fought at Pentland, Drumclog and Bothwell Brig, captured during a service in Fenwick and executed at Kilmarnock Cross on 14 April 1683). A stone plaque in Castle Street also records the name of John Law, who was shot in April 1685 while successfully helping eight Covenanters escape their imprisonment in Newmilns Keep.

===Weaving, Lace and Industrialisation===
Towards the end of the 16th century, Huguenot refugees settled in the area and introduced Newmilns to the craft of weaving. About two centuries later, Britain began importing cotton from the United States and as Newmilns by this time had a long-established weaving tradition, the town&#x27;s handloom industry rose to national prominence. The success of this industry can be seen by the growth in population from around 500 in 1750 to 2,000 in 1850. Newmilns also became very prosperous during this period, evidenced by both buildings around the Cross and the institution of the Trades&#x27; Race in 1743, which became an annual event for many years to come.

Born in Newmilns in 1821, Joseph Hood became a major player in the lace industry. By the age of 21, he had already developed, manufactured and supplied many Jacquard Looms and throughout his life, was responsible for many weaving innovations. Handloom weaving however was in decline. The introduction of the power loom in 1877 and general move towards automation left many weavers unemployed, resulting in a population drop as many left Newmilns to find work. Joseph Hood and his colleague, Hugh Morton, installed a lace curtain machine in Newmilns in 1876 and very quickly, others followed suit. Within ten years, a further eight companies had formed, providing work for over 1,500 people.

The success of the lace industry prompted a boom in the urban development of Newmilns. The town expanded rapidly in all directions, particularly to the east of the townfoot and south into Greenholm, with areas such as Loudoun Road, Darvel Road and Borebrae seeing the erection of many villas for Newmilns&#x27; growing middle-class. This was further augmented by the creation of council housing during the 20th century, primarily in Gilfoot, Mason&#x27;s Holm, Campbell Street and Ladeside. Expansion slowed however as the lace industry fell into decline during the 20th century, with foreign competition, World War I, the Great Depression and World War II all contributing to the loss of markets and access to raw materials. The original Hood &amp; Morton factory still stands on Nelson Street, but it is now disused. Only two lace mills remain in operation.

===Modern era===
Newmilns has suffered a significant drop in employment through the aforementioned decline of the lace industry, the closure of the Bleachfield, the railway station, the Cooperative and many other major employers including most recently, the Vesuvius plant in Brown Street. Many shopkeepers and tradesmen, who were dependent upon the business of locally employed residents have also gone out of business. This is reflected by the transformation of Newmilns from an industrial town into a commuter town, which is evidenced by a higher-than-average proportion of Newmilns&#x27; residents having to travel to their place of employment and a drop in population from a pre-war 5,000 to just over 3,000 today. Newmilns was affected in the July 2007 floods across the UK.

==Environment==

===Landscape===
Newmilns lies at the foot of a glaciated valley and is mostly surrounded by farmland and woodland. Of particular interest is the Lanfine Estate, which lies to the south of the town. The estate, although much older, came into the possession of the Brown family in 1769 and expanded from an initial to over by the end of the following century. The Browns&#x27; management of the estate not only oversaw this vast expansion of land, but saw many improvements to the land itself, including a large afforestation program (resulting in the present-day Lanfine Wood), the erection of a stately home and three gatehouses, the installation of Browns Road (which runs from Newmilns to Darvel and allows access to the estate) and the introduction of small game to the area. of the estate were bought by Herr Roesner in 1982 and development has continued, which most notably saw the introduction of wild boar to the estate during the 1990s. Today, both Browns Road and Lanfine are popular walks for residents of Newmilns.

===Townscape===

Newmilns extends for about two miles along the narrowest part of The Valley and roughly follows the course of the river. Most of the town sits on the north side of the river; the south side remains less developed, despite being generally flatter. Newmilns&#x27; urban development is reasonably easy to chart – as the town extends from The Cross to its outskirts, newer buildings become more abundant and the A71 gradually widens. In recent years, redevelopment of disused factories and buildings has brought new housing into older areas of the town, although some of these buildings have retained their original facade.

Newmilns&#x27; most significant buildings are concentrated in and around The Cross. The townhouse was built in 1739 and is a sign of Newmilns&#x27; prosperity during the handloom period. The townhouse steps led to the council chamber, and the side door (on the Main Street) led to the jail underneath. The town bell (housed in the belltower above the building) is engraved with the date &quot;1547&quot;, predating the building below. At the far end of The Cross from the townhouse is the Browns Institute, which was given to Newmilns by Ms Martha Brown (of Lanfine) in 1872. Across the road stands the Loudoun Arms, which was built during the 18th century. To the east of The Cross can be found three adjacent buildings, the Commercial Inn, Morton Hall and Lady Flora&#x27;s, which date to 1869, 1896 and 1875 respectively. Both Lady Flora&#x27;s and the Commercial Inn have since been turned into housing, but have retained their original facade. The Morton Hall still serves as Newmilns&#x27; town hall, however with regionalisation in 1975, responsibility for the hall was transferred to Kilmarnock &amp; Loudoun District Council (now East Ayrshire Council), taking it out of the hands of the Newmilns&#x27; townsfolk to whom it had been given.

Standing behind The Cross in Castle Street, The Keep (occasionally referred to as Newmilns Tower) is Newmilns&#x27; oldest building. The building dates from the 1530s and was probably built by Sir Hugh Campbell (not to be confused with either Hugh Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell of Loudoun or Hugh Campbell, 3rd Earl of Loudoun, who both lived much later). Over its history, The Keep has served many purposes, including being used as a barracks, prison, grain store, doocot, band hall and beer cellar. After falling into a state of disrepair for many years, it was restored in 1997 and now exists as housing.

On Brown Street at the Greenholm Bridge stands Lamlash House (formerly Bank House) an imposing red sandstone property of traditional Scots vernacular architecture which was built from 1888 to 1889 by Robert Carmichael Mitchell, the local Bank Agent and Match Manufacturer in Glasgow. The land on which the house sits was purchased from Ms Martha Brown of Lanfine Estate.
In the entrance staircase of the house, there are 5 Stephen Adam designed stained glass windows which feature images of James Hogg, Sir Walter Scott, Allan Ramsay, Robert Tannahill and Robert Burns. Each of the windows contains a floral panel which links back to the image of &quot;Flora&quot;, the Roman Goddess of flowers and the season of spring.
The property was Listed by Historic Scotland in 1992 and since 2006, has undergone a major programme of internal and external restoration works to ensure its longterm integrity.

Royal Bank of Scotland vacated the ground floor of the property in 2015 after over a century and a further programme of restoration has been carried out to reinstate the Victorian detailing which had been removed in the past. As part of the regeneration of Newmilns, the former Bank will be used for private events and functions.

===Wildlife===

With its mix of agricultural, wooded, urban, and freshwater environments, Newmilns is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Notably, this includes a red squirrel population which has largely escaped the reduction of its numbers seen elsewhere in the country. Alongside squirrels more common mammals can be found, such as the badger, fox, deer, rabbit, hare, weasel, stoat, hedgehog and species of rats, mice, shrews and voles. The river provides home to minnows, salmon and trout; frogs, toads, bats and a large and varied insect population can be found nearby. To the west of Newmilns, local residents have sighted common kingfishers along the riverbank which, although elusive, are a popular aspect of the river&#x27;s biodiversity.

Newmilns is also home to a large bird population. The Eurasian jackdaw is perhaps the most common resident and can be found nesting and feeding in buildings and gardens throughout the town. Accompanying the jackdaw are its close relatives, carrion crows and rooks (rooks are generally found on the outskirts of Newmilns) alongside a variety of other birds including the common swift, barn swallow, sparrowhawk, Eurasian wren, dunnock, robin, common starling, pied wagtail, spotted flycatcher, Eurasian magpie, dipper, oystercatcher, curlew, treecreeper, fieldfare, house sparrow, collared dove, woodpigeon, goose, common cuckoo, buzzard and multiple species of gull, duck, warbler, tit, thrush (notably the common blackbird) and finch. Grey herons are commonplace along the river and common kestrels are often found to the west of the town. Owls (generally tawny and barn) are also found in the area, although their numbers have reduced over the years.

===Lammas Floods===

On 18 October 1954, residents of Newmilns were shocked to witness an avalanche of &quot;black debris-littered scum&quot; make its way down Darvel Road before eventually settling at the East Strand. The black tide caused damage to homes and businesses across the east of Newmilns and prompted one factory owner, James Inglis, to sue the town council for damages. The town coup, which for eighteen years prior had been situated in a field above Darvel Road, had been washed downhill by severe rainfall and left much of Newmilns swamped in filth.

Many residents who witnessed this were reminded of the night of 10 August 1920, when severe rainfall caused the river to burst its banks in several places. The damage most notably occurred along the Main Street and Kilnholm Street, where the force of the river caused the adjacent stone wall to collapse (replaced by the current-day Red Wall) and caused the near-destruction of the Iron Brig (replaced by the current Iron Brig). It also caused great damage to the &quot;Henderson, Morton, Inglis &amp; Co&quot; factory, which was built over the Norrel Burn. The high volume of water caused the lade to burst and consequently, the burn flooded the factory floor causing damage to both machinery and electricity cables.

These floods are extreme examples of a phenomenon known as the &quot;Lammas Floods&quot;. As the floods usually occur around August, it is likely the name derives from Lammas Day, which falls on 1 August. Since 1954, better planning, understanding of rainfall patterns and sturdier building has severely marginalised the impact of the Lammas Floods, however both 2007 and 2008 saw their return to Newmilns, when heavy rainfall caused burns north of the town to burst their banks and flow through the streets, again causing damage to homes and businesses across the town.

==Recreation==
===Popular Pastimes===
Aside the usual array of clubs and organisations catering for different age ranges and interest groups, Newmilns is host to a variety of different sports, leisure &amp; social pursuits including a bowling club, a dry ski slope and mountain-bike track, three public houses, an annual cattle show, a library and three public parks at Greenside, the Glebe and Gilfoot. Jamieson Park (Gilfoot) is also home to Newmilns&#x27; amateur football team, &quot;Newmilns Vesuvius AFC&quot;, who currently play in the Premier Division of the Ayrshire AFC.Vesuvius disbanded in 2008 but in 2022 Newmilns Greenholm AFC was founded by a group of locals. &#x27;The holm&#x27; will begin playing in the Ayrshire Sunday Amateur League in 2023 and are sponsored by The Riverside Inn and the club badge incorporates the traditional red and white colours of previous clubs in the town.On August 13th Newmilns beat Lawthorn 2-0 in the clubs first ever league game.

===Irvine Valley Walking Festival===
2003 saw the commencement of the Irvine Valley Walking Festival. The 2003 festival was attended by 400 people and has since become an annual event, growing in size and stature over this time. The festival is based around the Irvine Valley Paths Network, which connects some 35 miles worth of disused railway line, rights of way and country roads around The Valley and nearby Hurlford. Participants are usually accompanied by guides, who impart their knowledge of local points of interest found along the way. The Irvine Valley Regeneration Partnership, which runs the event, is based in the townhouse at Newmilns Cross.

===Gala Day===
Like many towns, Newmilns holds an annual gala day. The day starts with a brass band-led parade, which includes representatives from local groups, businesses, organisations and members of the wider community. The parade assembles at Gilfoot and heads east along Loudoun Road, Kilnholm Street and the Main Street, before turning right onto Union Street and disbanding at Greenside Park (until recent years the parade followed the reverse of this route, assembling in Union Street and disbanding at the Jamieson Park).

The main event usually lasts throughout the afternoon and plays host to bands, battle reenactments, races, stalls and amusements such as tug-o-war and beat-the-goalie competitions, with the events of the afternoon culminating in the crowning of the gala queen. The gala day is viewed as an important event in Newmilns&#x27; social calendar as it brings together and caters for the whole community. The Newmilns Gala Committee, which organises the event, also holds fundraisers throughout the year, which again are viewed as important social events for similar reasons.

==Interesting facts==

===Age of Steam===

The present-day Vesuvius site was originally a railway station. It was opened in 1850 and proved successful until around the 1930s, when passengers gradually switched to the local bus service. From then on, the railway mainly carried freight and mail. Despite remaining financially viable, Newmilns&#x27; railway service was axed during Richard Beeching&#x27;s &quot;Reshaping of British Railways&quot; in the 1960s.

The area behind Newmilns Fire Station was formerly home to Loudoun Colliery, with a bogey line carrying coal from the colliery to the main railway. Subsequent housing development has rendered the bogey line undetectable, but the hump in the road outside the entrances to Gilfoot and Mason&#x27;s Holm marks the spot where it crossed the A71. The road running up to Woodhead Farm is known locally as &quot;The Pit Brae&quot;, as it provided access to the colliery.

===Anti-Slavery Society===
In response to the American Civil War, the &quot;Newmilns Anti-Slavery Society&quot; was formed. After writing to the U.S. Government to declare their support for the anti-slavery cause, an appreciative Abraham Lincoln presented Newmilns with an American flag. The flag however was eventually lost, leading U.S. Consul, General Dayle C McDonough to present a new one during Newmilns&#x27; Civic Week celebrations in 1949.

===The Battle of the Lime Road===
The Lime Road, which is found on the western periphery of Newmilns, was once a popular walk for local residents. From 1878 to 1893, Baron Donington of Loudoun Castle erected barriers, in a bid to block walkers&#x27; access. Local residents took the case to court and eventually won, protecting the Lime Road&#x27;s status as a public right-of-way. It is now recognised by the Irvine Valley Path Network, although certain barriers have been erected to block free access to Loudoun Castle Theme Park.

===Robert Burns===
In 1786, Robert Burns used the proceeds from his &quot;Kilmarnock Edition&quot; to book passage from Greenock to Jamaica, in the hope of making a better life for himself abroad. At this time he was relatively unknown in Scotland and was only dissuaded from leaving after receiving a letter from the Edinburgh-based poet, Thomas Blacklock. This letter arrived only days before Burns was due to leave, but succeeded in encouraging him to stay and publish more work (which also saved Burns&#x27; life, as the ship sank en route to the West Indies). Blacklock himself had only recently become aware of Burns, after receiving a copy of the Kilmarnock Edition from one Rev. George Lawrie, of Loudoun Manse.

Lawrie is known to have received Burns several times at the manse. In reference to this, Burns&#x27; brother Gilbert wrote, &quot;This was a delightful family scene for our poet, then lately introduced to the world. His mind was roused to a poetic enthusiasm and the stanzas were left in the room where he slept.&quot; Alongside the stanza referred to, Burns also presented Lawrie&#x27;s daughters with verses describing his visits to Loudoun Manse and on one window pane in the manse, scratched the following line with his diamond, &quot;Lovely Mrs. Lawrie, she is all charms.&quot;

===Football===
Around the start of the 20th century, many local footballers went on to have successful careers in both the Scottish and English leagues. The best-remembered of these is perhaps Hugh Wilson, who in 1890 was capped for Scotland against Wales whilst playing for Newmilns Seniors. He not only won further caps for Scotland, but went on to win three English league titles with Sunderland in 1892, 1893 &amp; 1895, before returning to Scotland to win the league &amp; cup with Third Lanark in 1904 &amp; 1905 respectively.

In 1891, local lace manufacturers, &quot;Johnstone Shields &amp; Co&quot;, opened a factory in Gothenburg, using Newmilns employees to set up and run the site. Whilst in Gothenburg, the employees established a team, &quot;Örgryte Idrottsällskap&quot; and won Sweden&#x27;s first ever football match. The employees went on to form another team, which eventually evolved into the world-renowned &quot;IFK Göteborg&quot;.

Two years later, Johnstone Shields set up a factory in Barcelona and again used their Newmilns workforce. The men from Newmilns set up another football team, &quot;Colonia Escocesa&quot;, which, according to local historians, contested the first ever Spanish cup final. This is slightly ambiguous, the first Copa del Rey final was contested between Club Vizcaya (later Athletic Club de Bilbao) and FC Barcelona. Records do show however that in 1900, Colonia Escocesa lost 2–0 to FC Barcelona, in a match recorded as &quot;Amistoso Internacional&quot; (Catalan for &quot;International Friendly&quot;). Whilst seemingly not part of an official tournament, it is quite possible that the participating players viewed the match as an international cup final, explaining why oral tradition remembers it as such.

At least one Newmilns man, George Girvan, went on to play for FC Barcelona before returning to Scotland. Such was Barca&#x27;s immediate success, it is not unlikely that he and other Newmilns residents would have won silverware with the club.

===Gowf===
The site which occupies Loudoun Gowf Club was originally rented from the Earl of Loudoun in 1908. The rental was under the condition that were the club to close, the area should be returned to its pre-rental state. As the club was notoriously poor at turning a profit, it&#x27;s believed it only survived because until 1947, it never had sufficient funds to return the area to its original condition.

===Street Names===
Over the years, various street name changes have taken place. High Street was originally divided into three parts, known from bottom to top as &quot;Doitburn Street&quot;, &quot;Grey Street&quot; &amp; &quot;High Street&quot;. Nelson Street was similarly divided, known from west to east as &quot;North Devon Place&quot;, &quot;Waterwynd&quot; &amp; &quot;Nelson Street&quot;. The area of the Main Street around the Brigend was known as &quot;West Strand&quot;. The &quot;East Strand&quot; was located at the gardens on the Main Street, opposite the Long Entry. Castle Street was originally &quot;New Road&quot; and Kilnholm Street led to an area known simply as &quot;The Wilderness&quot;. Loudoun Road West was known (locally at least) as the &quot;Toll Road&quot; and King Street was formerly known as &quot;Back Street&quot;. A sign on an entry-wall in Loudoun Road (at the corner of Shields Road) records the name &quot;Jeffrey Place&quot;, although it is uncertain what area this encompassed.

Names of streets have changed, but one area of Greenholm has all but disappeared. &quot;Stewarts Place&quot; occupied the area between Browns Road and the Tilework Brae and was built to accommodate navvies brought to Newmilns for the purpose of extending the railway line to Darvel. Stewarts Place gradually fell into disrepair and became locally known as &quot;Bedlam&quot;, due to this. Remnants of the buildings still stand, but lie behind a large, stone wall and as such are largely unnoticed by local residents.

Gilfoot was built from 1936 to 1939 and was pragmatically fitted out with electric street lighting. Initially, the street lights were not connected to an electricity supply, so gas lights were hung from lamp-posts until electrification could take place. The sight of this gave the area an eastern feel, leading local residents to refer to Gilfoot as &quot;Shanghai&quot;. Although the name is not in common use today, it persisted for many years after the gas lights were removed.

<text>Marlon Lamont Wayans (born July 23, 1972) is an American actor, comedian, writer, and producer. He is best known for his work with his brother Shawn Wayans on The WB sitcom &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; (1995–1999) and the comedy films &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace&quot; (1996), &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000), &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; (2001), &quot;White Chicks&quot; (2004), &quot;Little Man&quot; (2006), and &quot;Dance Flick&quot; (2009)&quot;.&quot; Wayans will star in the upcoming films &quot;Scary Movie 6 (2026)&quot; and &quot;White Chicks 2&quot; (TBA).&quot;&quot;

Wayans&#x27; other film credits include &quot;Above the Rim&quot; (1994), &quot;The 6th Man&quot; (1997), &quot;Norbit&quot; (2007), &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; (2009), &quot;The Heat&quot; (2013), &quot;A Haunted House&quot; (2013) and its sequel &quot;A Haunted House 2&quot; (2014), &quot;Naked&quot; (2017), &quot;Fifty Shades of Black&quot; (2016), &quot;Sextuplets&quot; (2019), and &quot;On the Rocks&quot; (2020). He also had several dramatic roles, including the psychological drama film &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000).

Wayans partnered with Randy Adams to create &quot;What the Funny&quot;, an online destination for urban comedy. He created the comedy competition television show &quot;Funniest Wins,&quot; which aired on TBS in 2014. In 2014, Wayans and his brothers traveled the U.S. with &quot;The Wayans Brothers Tour&quot;. In 2017, he co-wrote and starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;Marlon,&quot; which ran for two seasons.

==Early life==
Wayans was born in New York City, the son of Elvira Alethia (Green), a homemaker and social worker, and Howell Stouten Wayans, a supermarket manager. He was raised in Fulton Houses, a housing project in New York City, the youngest of ten siblings. He is the brother of Nadia, Shawn, Keenen Ivory, Damon, Dwayne, and Kim. His family were Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Wayans went to Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts in New York City, the school made famous in &quot;Fame&quot;. After graduating from high school, he attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., but dropped out after two years.

==Career==
Between 1992 and 1993, Wayans appeared with his siblings on the sketch comedy show &quot;In Living Color&quot;. From 1995 until 1999, he co-starred in the WB sitcom &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; with his brother Shawn Wayans. He was originally considered for the role of Robin in the 1992 film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, but it was felt that the film featured too many characters, so his character was omitted. Wayans was then formally signed to the role in the 1995 sequel &quot;Batman Forever&quot; to play opposite Billy Dee Williams as Two-Face, but the mid-production change in directors from Tim Burton to Joel Schumacher resulted in both parts being recast and Wayans being paid out (Williams was not yet signed on, but received a penalty fee as his contract for &quot;Batman&quot; allowed him the option of reprise), and he still receives royalty payments. He was replaced by Chris O&#x27;Donnell. In August 2021, a comic book adaptation of the original concept, &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;, began publication, by DC Entertainment, using Wayans&#x27;s likeness for Robin with his permission, their civilian identity renamed Drake Winston.

Wayans produced the first two films of the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; series, in which he and Shawn were credited writers and co-stars. Those films were released in 2000 and 2001. In 2000, Wayans appeared as Tyrone C. Love in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; and as Snails in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. That same year, he and Shawn hosted the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Wayans also produced the Nickelodeon cartoon series &quot;Thugaboo&quot;. In 2017, NBC gave him his own sitcom, &quot;Marlon&quot;; it was canceled after two seasons.

In September 2017, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Wayans would partner with LA-based entertainment company Shots Studios to launch a YouTube channel. He has appeared in videos alongside creators such as Anwar Jibawi and Hannah Stocking. In 2020, Wayans signed a deal with HBO Max.

==Personal life==
Wayans was in a long-term relationship with Angela Zackery from 1992 to 2013, and although he once called her his &quot;ex-wife&quot;, he said in 2021 that he had never married. They have two children. Wayans also shares a child with his former girlfriend, Brittany Moreland. Wayans was a close friend of rapper Tupac Shakur. He is also a longtime friend of actor Omar Epps. One of Wayans&#x27; children came out as transgender in 2023, in which he has expressed support for him, including through an altercation with Soulja Boy on Twitter in which Soulja Boy used homophobic slurs to attack Wayans&#x27; son. Wayans responded by posting &quot;If [Soulja Boy] had a career he could get cancelled for this type of slander, luckily he ain&#x27;t been relevant since 2007&quot;.

<doc id="650468" wikidata="Q1229136" url="?curid=650468" title="Grooved ware">
<text>Grooved ware is the name given to a pottery style of the British Neolithic. Its manufacturers are sometimes known as the Grooved ware people. Unlike the later Beaker ware, Grooved culture was not an import from the continent but seems to have developed in Orkney, early in the 3rd millennium BC, and was soon adopted in Great Britain and Ireland.

The diagnostic shape for the style is a flat-bottomed pot with straight sides sloping outwards and grooved decoration around the top. Beyond this the pottery comes in many varieties, some with complex geometric decorations others with applique bands added. The latter has led some archaeologists to argue that the style is a skeuomorph and is derived from wicker basketry.

Grooved ware pots excavated at Balfarg in Fife have been chemically analysed to determine their contents. It appears that some of the vessels there may have been used to hold black henbane (&quot;Hyoscyamus niger&quot;) which is a poison and a powerful hallucinogen.

Since many Grooved ware pots have been found at henge sites and in burials, it is possible that they may have had a ritual purpose as well as a functional one. Grooved ware comes in many sizes, some vessels are extremely large, , and would be suitable for fermentation. The majority are smaller, ranging from jug- to cup-size, and could be used for serving and drinking. The theory that the first British farmers (c. 4000 BC) had the knowledge and ability to make ale from their crops with their pottery appears to be controversial and not yet widely discussed by the archaeological community.

The earliest examples have been found in Orkney and may have evolved from earlier Unstan ware bowls. Excavations at nearby Ness of Brodgar have revealed many sherds of finely decorated Grooved ware pottery, some of it representing very large pots. Many drinking vessels have also been identified. The style soon spread and it was used by the builders of the first phase of Stonehenge. Grooved ware pottery has been found in abundance in excavations at Durrington Walls and Marden Henge in Wiltshire. Here, the feasting would have involved drinking ale and eating pork. Smaller quantities of Grooved ware have been found at the nearby site of Figsbury Ring.

Grooved ware was previously referred to as Rinyo-Clacton ware, first identified by Stuart Piggott in the 1950s and named after sites where it was found. Rinyo is a neolithic settlement on the island of Rousay, Orkney. The site at Clacton now lies under the sea.

One way the tradition may have spread is through trade routes up the west coast of Britain. What seems unusual is that although they shared the same style of pottery, different regions still maintained vastly different traditions. Evidence at some early Henges (Mayburgh Henge, Ring of Brodgar, Arbor Low) suggests that there were staging and trading points on a national &#x27;motorway&#x27; during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. This evidence perhaps explains how Cumbrian stone axes found their way to Orkney.

Unstan ware, a variation on grooved ware, emerged in Orkney. The people who used Unstan ware had totally different burial practices but managed to co-exist with their Grooved ware counterparts. Some hybrid chambered cairns have emerged in this region, containing architectural features of both the Maeshowe subclass and the Orkney-Cromarty stalled subclasses of cairn.

<doc id="650469" wikidata="Q1770307" url="?curid=650469" title="Rövarspråket">
<text>Rövarspråket () is a Swedish language game. It became popular after the books about Bill Bergson by Astrid Lindgren, where the children use it as a code, both at play and in solving actual crimes.

The formula for encoding is simple. Every consonant (spelling matters, not pronunciation) is doubled, and an &quot;o&quot; is inserted in-between. Vowels are left intact. It is possible to render the &quot;Rövarspråket&quot; version of an English word as well as a Swedish, such as the following for the word &quot;stubborn&quot;:

:&quot;sos-tot-u-bob-bob-o-ror-non&quot; or &quot;sostotubobboborornon&quot;

The code is not very useful in written form, but it can be difficult to decode when spoken by a trained user speaking quickly. For an untrained speaker, a word or phrase can often be something of a tongue-twister or a shibboleth.

Today, the books (and subsequent films) are so well known in Sweden, and also in Norway, that the language is part of the culture of schoolchildren.

<doc id="650474" wikidata="Q441793" url="?curid=650474" title="Storm Constantine">
<text>Storm Constantine (12 October 1956 – 14 January 2021) was a British science fiction and fantasy author, primarily known for her Wraeththu series, which began as one trilogy but has spawned many subsequent works.

Beginning in the 1980s, Constantine&#x27;s short stories appeared in dozens of genre fiction magazines and anthologies. She authored over 30 published novels and non-fiction books (often examining issues of sex and gender), and numerous other publications, including grimoires. Her debut novel, &quot;The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit&quot;, was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award for Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror. Subsequent work was nominated for the BSFA Award, the British Fantasy Award, the Locus Award and the Otherwise Award.

In addition to her work as a writer, Constantine headed Immanion Press, an independent publishing company she founded in 2003 to publish her own back catalogue and works by other niche writers.

== Early life ==
Constantine was born on 12 October 1956 in Stafford, Staffordshire. She began creating stories and art at an early age, devising make-believe worlds and writing sequels to Greek and Roman myths. In a 2017 interview, she said, &quot;Before I learned to write as a young child, I made stories up in my head [...] I embellished reality always and often got into trouble for it. I simply had a natural impulse to make things up and it&#x27;s been part of me all my life.&quot;

== Education and early career ==
Constantine attended Stafford Girls&#x27; High School, then attended Stafford Art College from 1971–1972, though she left before completing her degree, frustrated with the institution&#x27;s disdain for figurative art. 

In the early 1980s, she joined the Goth subculture in and around Birmingham, eventually developing friendships with several bands and eventually managing a few. She later cited her years in this scene as a strong influence for her Wraeththu series, explaining to an interviewer that the people around her &quot;were all very androgynous&quot; and to her &quot;seemed like fantasy creatures&quot;. 

Her primary day job was at Stafford&#x27;s public library.

== Writing ==

=== Wraeththu ===
Constantine began her serious writing career by writing a novel which became the &quot;Wraeththu Chronicles&quot; and included &quot;The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit&quot;, &quot;The Bewitchments of Love and Hate&quot;, and &quot;The Fulfillments of Fate and Desire&quot;. Working as a librarian at the time, she decided to focus on writing when she came to the following realization: &quot;This is it for the rest of my life. I&#x27;ve got to do something about it.&quot; Constantine had been working with the concept and characters of Wraeththu since the late 1970s.

By the late 1980s, Constantine had a synopsis and outline of the trilogy completed. One day, she was at the Andromeda bookshop in Birmingham (operated by Rog Peyton) when she had a chance encounter with a representative from MacDonald Futura (which was absorbed by Little, Brown Book Group in 1992). The representative subsequently picked up the novels, which were published between 1987 and 1989. 

The first book of the series, &quot;The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit&quot;, was a finalist for the 1991 Lambda Literary Award for Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror. 

In 1993, Tor released the trilogy in omnibus format in the United States. The trilogy developed a cult following, particularly in the Goth subculture and among those interested in fiction tackling alternative sexuality.

Beginning with the initial trilogy, and continuing on to subsequent novels, novellas, and short stories, the Wraeththu stories follow the rise of a race of hermaphrodites / androgynes transformed from humans. This new race takes possession of a world decline, a slow apocalypse, and then rebuilds the world into something better. Members of the new species are referred to as &quot;hara&quot;. The world of Wraeththu includes representations of real-life Earth continents and cultures, but all have been renamed and reworked. Constantine described the setting as an &quot;alternate reality&quot;.

Constantine framed the Wraeththu as follows:

Humanity is in decline, ravaged by insanity, natural disasters, conflict, disease and infertility. A mysterious new race has risen from the ghettos and ruins of the decaying, dying cities. The young are evolving into a new species, which is stronger, sharper and more beautiful than their forerunners. Androgynous beings, they transcend gender and race. They possess skin psychic abilities and the means, through a process called inception, to transform humans into creatures like themselves. But they are wild in their rebirth and must strive to overcome all that is human within them in order to create society anew. They are the Wraeththu.

The structure and plot of the Wraeththu Chronicles revolves around three characters: Pellaz (&quot;Pell&quot;), Swift, and Calanthe (&quot;Cal&quot;), who are (in that order) the first-person narrators. Their intertwining stories begin with Cal meeting Pell and whisking him away to a town where he is incepted and becomes har. Eventually the couple, deeply in love, encounter Swift, a Wraeththu child living in the home of a high-ranking tribal leader. Shortly after their visit, Pell is killed. All is not as it seems, however, and Pell is &quot;reborn&quot; and becomes the Tigron of Immanion, ruler the Gelaming tribe. Swift&#x27;s narrative, a coming-of-age story, tells the tale of what happened after Pell and Cal left, and then what happened when Cal returned, devastated by the loss of Pell. In the third book, set a couple of decades later, Cal pieces together the shattered memories of his life and embarks on a quest to reunite with Pell, who, as he has learned, is alive. At the end of the book, Cal arrives in Immanion and claims Pell once again as his own. Pell has already bonded with another har and sired. And although the other har is angry, by the finale, the three hara become joint rulers of the Gelaming and by extension the Wraeththu race.

In subsequent works, including a trilogy intersecting with the first, several novels, and many short stories, Constantine further developed Wraeththu, in particular their evolution into fully realized, androgynous beings. After beginning their lives as rebellious teenagers and subsequently inheriting the world, they must take responsibility. In a 2016 interview, Constantine reflected:

Wraeththu are simply how the human race would be if I could design it myself: androgynous, beautiful (mostly), magical and housed in a more efficient vehicle of flesh and blood. Yet Wraeththu hara are not stainless; they are flawed. What makes them different from humanity – apart from their androgyny and improved physical/psychic being – is that they have a clean slate to start anew. Longevity helps them; humans, being frail creatures, become infirm and die just as they reach the threshold to real wisdom. Hara might have risen from a brutal start, but have a greater capacity to rise above it, to reach their potential. A world without villains and conflict, from a fictional point of view, would be pretty dull, so the mythos has to include those aspects. Wraeththu aren&#x27;t perfect, but to me they are better than what came before.As Constantine became more active in online spaces beginning in the early 2000s, she found interest in the Wraeththu stories remained high, which led her to write the &quot;Wraeththu Histories&quot; following events and characters in the &quot;Wraeththu Chronicles&quot;. The books garnered interest with publishers in the United States but not in the United Kingdom. Wanting to release the new books and revised editions of the original trilogy, Constantine founded Immanion Press in 2003, where she could publish both her own work and that of other authors.

During the 2000s and 2010s, Constantine authored and published several more Wraeththu novels, contributed and/or edited numerous short story collections, and put out several non-fiction works. 

==== Fan fiction ====
With the publication of &quot;Histories&quot; and the revised &quot;Chronicles&quot;, Wraeththu fans emerged as an enthusiastic community online. Numerous web sites emerged, including an online zine and a fan fiction archive. Constantine regularly interacted directly with fans through online forums, early forms of social media, and weekly online chats. In 2003, this coalesced into Grissecon, a convention held in Stafford for fans of Wraeththu and related fiction and topics. Subsequently, Constantine participated in numerous conventions, including Lunacon and Dragon Con in the United States, plus many others in the United Kingdom.

Constantine was accepting of fan fiction, and once she began to read what her fans had written, actively encouraged it. In a 2016 interview, she expounded on her attitude:It was brought to my attention that a small community had arisen devoted to writing Wraeththu fanfic. The main reason these writers had turned to my Mythos was because they&#x27;d been hounded out of another one by a famous writer who strongly objected to their activities. A fanfic writer mailed me about this and asked for my opinion, and what I felt about fan fiction set in a world I&#x27;d invented and about which I still continued to write. I thought about it for some time, and realized that I didn&#x27;t feel offended at all. As far as I could see, it was similar to a time in my childhood when I&#x27;d also invented make-believe worlds – avidly – and the more friends I could get to share in that make-believe and play in my world, the better. This to me was the same. People were coming to play in my garden with me. Why should that be offensive? Could I ever stop people imagining these stories? No. Hadn&#x27;t I myself begun my writing life as a fanfic author – albeit writing &#x27;sequels&#x27; to Greek and Roman myths as a child rather than an established author&#x27;s work? I understood the impulse to add to an invented world, to want to play in it when the author had closed the gates for the night.She eventually used her publisher, Immanion Press, to publish novels that began as fan fiction and published fans&#x27; short stories as anthologies.

=== Other writing ===
Following the success of Wraeththu, Constantine embarked on a decade of high productivity which included the publication of two fantasy trilogies, a science fiction duet and six stand-alone novels, including &quot;Silverheart&quot;, a collaboration with Michael Moorcock. The Grigori trilogy is a modern-day fantasy tale in which characters connect back with the mysterious Nephilim, referred to in the books as Grigori. The Magravandias trilogy is a more conventional fantasy tale, with nobles, castles, medieval warfare and dragons. The Artemis duet is a science fiction tale about a colony world where radical feminism has gone disastrously wrong, with males having been made completely subservient. The remaining stand-alone novels are genre works which fall under the genres of cyberpunk, dark fantasy, and science fiction. Constantine&#x27;s short stories were widely printed in genre fiction magazines, which during the decade were thriving, and in larger print anthologies. With the publication of so many novels and stories, Constantine&#x27;s cult following grew, and she began to appear at many science fiction and fantasy conventions in the United Kingdom as well as Dragon Con in the United States.

During this time period, Constantine also founded a fiction magazine with Jamie Spracklen, called &quot;Visionary Tongue&quot;, through which she published fiction by Freda Warrington, Graham Joyce, and Tanith Lee.

== Immanion Press ==

Constantine founded Immanion Press in 2003, an option that became commercially viable with the arrival of affordable and efficient print-on-demand services. She published her own works, as well as fiction and non-fiction texts from other authors. In addition to standalone books, Immanion Press published a series of Wraeththu short story anthologies featuring her own work as well as those of fan writers. The initial collection was published in 2010, and within ten years, it had been joined by five others.

Although the company attracted several prominent authors, including Tanith Lee and David Barnett, for the most part, the fiction side of the house lost money. After a few years, Constantine opted to focus more on esoteric non-fiction, covering such topics as paganism, magic, myth and mythology and Reiki.

In addition to writing more Wraeththu books, Constantine was primary editor for many books Immanion Press published. She laid out many books, including her own, for publication, formatting text, setting up artwork, and preparing the final file to be sent to the printer.

== Personal life and death ==
In the late 1980s, Constantine began using the name Storm Constantine as a pen name and eventually changed her name legally. When asked about her name in a 2010 interview, she said, &quot;I feel that as people grow up, they don&#x27;t always fit the names they&#x27;ve been given by their parents. So I decided quite early on that I wanted a different name. I chose one I felt would give me assertiveness and confidence.&quot; 

Constantine lived in Stafford her entire life and was married to Jim Hibbert. They lived in a Victorian terrace house they restored and shared their lives with a menagerie of cats.

Constantine died aged on 14 January 2021 following a long illness.

<text>Jack Tworkov (15 August 1900 – 4 September 1982) was an American abstract expressionist painter.

==Early life and education==
Yakov Tworkovsky, was born in Biała Podlaska on the border between Poland and the Russian Empire. His father was a tailor who immigrated to the United States in the early 1910s to set up the family tailoring business in New York City. In 1913, Tworkov, his mother, and younger sister travelled to New York through Ellis Island. Upon arriving to America, both children changed their names, Yakov became Jack, and his sister Schenehaia became Janice Biala. Tworkov enrolled in the American public school system. 

Tworkov was initially uninterested in painting and instead attended Columbia University to become a writer. His sister encouraged him to attend classes at the Art Students League of New York. The League proved influential for Tworkov&#x27;s art career, sparking his interest in the field art. Two of his major influences early on were painters Cézanne and Matisse. Their influence along with his sisters prompted him to study art at the National Academy of Design and Art Students League of New York. 

== Career ==
In 1924, he joined friends Yosl Cutler and Zuni Maud to be set and costume designers for Maurice Schwartz&#x27;s production of Abraham Goldfaden&#x27;s &quot;Di Kishefmacherin&quot;. They created puppets for the show and decided to launch a puppet theatre. The trio expanded their early work during a summer spent in the Catskills, at a summer home of left wing painters and writers, who offered opinions. In 1925 the trio opened the Modjacot (a portmanteau of their names) Spiel Theatre, the first Yiddish puppet theatre in America. Tworkov dropped out, and the amalgam name became Modicot.

In 1929 America entered into the great depression; following the economic collapse President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the Work Projects Administration. Tworkov, being an aspiring artist, sought employment as a member of the Federal Art Project division of the Work Projects Administration met, which is where he met one of the first artists responsible for bring Abstract Expressionism to the attention of the American public, Willem de Kooning. This is the time in which Tworkov&#x27;s art begins to take on the early signs of Abstract Expressionism style. Tworkov and de Koonig met many other abstract painters, and together with a group of abstract expressionists including Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, founded the New York School. Many of the people involved in creating the New York School including Tworkov were also involved with the creating of the 8th Street Club, which was responsible for hosting the 9th Street Art Exhibition, which was largely regarded as the event in which the New York School style was truly exposed to the American people.

During his lifetime, Tworkov taught at several institutions, including the American University, Black Mountain College, Queens College, Pratt Institute, University of Minnesota, Columbia University, and Yale University where he was the chairman of the Art Department from 1963 to 1969. As chairman, Tworkov invited known artists to teach, including Al Held, Knox Martin, George Wardlaw, and Bernard Chaet. Among the students of that era were Chuck Close, Jennifer Bartlett, Richard Serra, Nancy Graves, Rackstraw Downes, and Brice Marden. In 1970, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. 

Tworkov is regarded as an important and influential artist, along with Rothko, de Kooning, Philip Guston, Franz Kline, and Pollock, whose gestural paintings of the early 1950s formed the basis for the abstract expressionist movement in America. Major work from this period is characterized by the use of gestural brush strokes in flame-like color. His work transitioned during the mid-1960s. Straight lines and geometric patterns characterize his later art work. &quot;Wedding Flags&quot; of 1965, included in the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY, is a transitional painting that combines both abstract expressionism and geometric abstraction.

Despite being credited as one of the founders of the New York School, Tworkov&#x27;s later works of art diverged from this style of painting. After the 1950s one can see from Tworkov&#x27;s art that he takes a more geometric approach to his work; this is easily identifiable by his artwork specifically Indian Red Series #2 (1979). Tworkov&#x27;s experiments with geometric shapes were largely inspired by basic geometry and number systems, as well as the well known Fibonacci number sequence.

What was formerly the UBS Art Gallery in New York exhibited five decades of Tworkov&#x27;s work in the 2009 show &quot;Against Extremes&quot;, &quot;a tantalizing historical survey&quot; charting everything from his de Kooning roots to his omnipresent &quot;dream of freedom&quot;.

Tworkov died in 1982 in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He was 82.

<text>The Brünig steam railway line () is a Swiss narrow gauge railway line that links Lucerne, in central Switzerland, with Interlaken, in the Bernese Oberland. The line runs via Alpnachstad, Giswil, Meiringen and Brienz, and passes over the Brünig Pass, using sections of rack railway to overcome the gradients, but with most of the line operated by normal adhesion methods.

The line is long. It opened in stages between 1888 and 1916, and was, between 1903 and 2004, the only narrow gauge line of the Swiss Federal Railways. Today the line forms part, along with the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line, of the Zentralbahn company. The line is served by InterRegio trains that operate the full length of the line, with regular (non-rack) Regio trains between Interlaken and Meiringen, and Lucerne S-Bahn trains between Lucerne and Giswil. The section between Hergiswil and Lucerne is shared with the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line.

== History ==

The line was constructed by the Jura–Bern–Lucerne Railway (JBL), which opened the section between Brienz over the Brünig Pass to Alpnachstad in 1888. Initially, the line connected to steamships on Lake Brienz and Lake Lucerne, but was extended in 1889 from Alpnachstad to Lucerne, giving connections to the rest of the Swiss railway network. In 1891, JBL became part of the Jura–Simplon Railway (JS).

In 1903, the JS became part of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). Only in 1916 did the last section of the current line, between Brienz and Interlaken, open. This allowed through trains to operate from Lucerne to Interlaken, and provided an easy interchange with trains to Bern and beyond.

The line was electrified in 1941 and 1942, using the standard Swiss main line system of supplied by overhead line. The electrification led to a significant acceleration of services, with typical through journey times reduced from over 3 hours to 2 hours.

In 1964, a junction was constructed at Hergiswil with the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg Railway (LSE), and from that date trains of the LSE used Brünig line tracks to reach Lucerne station. On 30 June 2004, the Swiss Federal Council empowered the SBB to sell the Brünig line to the Zentralbahn company, formed by the LSE, and which now owns both railways. The takeover took effect on 1 January 2005.

In late 2012, a new tunnel route was opened between Kriens Mattenhof station and the approaches to Lucerne station. The tunnel replaces a less direct surface alignment, allowing the abolition of several congested level crossings and the provision of double track. A new station, Lucerne Allmend/Messe, built within the tunnel, serves the Swissporarena.

== Operation ==

=== Route ===



The line begins at Lucerne station, one of Switzerland&#x27;s principal railway stations and which is shared with the standard gauge lines of the Swiss Federal Railways. The metre gauge terminal platforms, and the first section of the line, are shared with trains of the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line. Shortly after leaving the station, the line enters a tunnel under Lucerne&#x27;s southern suburbs as far as Kriens Mattenhof station. From here the line runs on the surface to Hergiswil, where the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line diverges.

From Hergiswil station the Brünig line runs through the Lopper I tunnel, under a shoulder of Mount Pilatus, to Alpnachstad, which is the starting point of the Pilatus Railway. The two lines are of different gauges, and there is no track connection. From Alpnachstad station, the Brünig line follows the Sarner Aa and Lake Sarnen to Giswil. Beyond Giswil station, the line&#x27;s first rack section then allows the line to climb to Kaiserstuhl station. From here, the runs through the upper basin of the Sarner Aa and alongside Lake Lungern as far as Lungern. This is the steepest adhesion worked section of the line.

After Lungern station, a second rack section lifts the line to its summit at Brünig-Hasliberg station in the Brünig Pass. Beyond the pass, the line descends its third and final rack section, down the steep side of the valley of the Aare, to Meiringen. This is the steepest rack worked section of the line. At Meiringen station, the Brünig line reverses direction with trains both entering and leaving the station from the west end. The Meiringen–Innertkirchen Railway (MIB) connects here, leaving the station from its eastern end. Although there is a track connection between the two lines, they are electrically incompatible, and no through trains operate.

From Meiringen to Brienz the line runs close to the Aare, in that river&#x27;s valley. At Brienz station, the starting point of the Brienz Rothorn Railway is beside the Brünig railway station. The two lines are of different gauges, and there is no track connection. Beyond Brienz, the Brünig line runs along the northern shore of Lake Brienz, in a section often affected by landslides. Finally the line crosses the Aare on a high bridge, so built in order to allow lake shipping to reach Interlaken. It then passes over the standard gauge access to the BLS AG works at Bönigen, before descending into its terminus at Interlaken Ost station, which is shared with the BLS AG and Berner Oberland Railway (BOB). There is a physical connection with the BOB, which is also metre gauge, but again the lines are electrically incompatible and no through trains operate.

=== Infrastructure ===
The line is built to metre gauge ( gauge), and operates on the rack and adhesion principle, using sections of Riggenbach rack to overcome the steeper gradients encounted on the approaches to the Brünig pass, but with most of the line operated by normal adhesion methods. The line is electrified using the standard Swiss main line system of 15 kV, Hz AC, delivered by overhead line. The line has maximum gradients of 12%, using the rack, and 3%, using simple adhesion.

The route is long. It consists mostly of single track with passing loops at most stations, although the section between Lucerne and Hergiswil, which is shared with the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line, is mostly double track. For much of the distance between Lucerne and Horw, one of these two tracks is dual gauge, allowing standard gauge freight trains to reach the industrial areas along the line, and the Eichhof brewery.

The steam locomotives G 3/4 and HG 3/3 can operate on the rack sections only in the forward direction, hence turntables are needed. The historic, hand-operated turntable in Meiringen was dismantled in 2011, but was rebuilt at a new location in 2013. Similarly, the historic turntable in Giswil was moved to another location in the course of the renewal of the station in 2013.

=== Services ===
The line is served by hourly InterRegio trains that operate the full length of the line, taking just under two hours for the journey. These through trains stop at all stations between Meiringen and Giswil, where they provide the only service, but only at a selected stations between Interlaken and Meiringen, and between Lucerne and Giswil.

The through trains are supplemented by local trains at each end of the route. An hourly Regio train operates between Interlaken and Meiringen, stopping at all stations. Between Lucerne and Giswil, twice-hourly trains of the Lucerne S-Bahn line S5 provide a stopping service. The section of line between Hergiswil and Lucerne is shared with trains on the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line, including a further InterRegio train per hour, and the twice-hourly Lucerne S-Bahn line S4.

<doc id="650490" wikidata="Q12371246" url="?curid=650490" title="Peace churches">
<text>Peace churches are Christian churches, groups or communities advocating Christian pacifism or Biblical nonresistance. The term historic peace churches refers specifically only to three church groups among pacifist churches:
* Church of the Brethren, including all daughter churches such as the Old German Baptist Brethren, Old Brethren and Dunkard Brethren; 
* Religious Society of Friends (Quakers); and 
* Mennonites, including the Amish, Beachy Amish, Old Order Mennonites, and Conservative Mennonites

In addition to the Schwarzenau Brethren and Mennonites, other Anabaptist Christian fellowships, such as the Hutterian Brethren, River Brethren, Apostolic Christian Church and Bruderhof teach pacifism as well.

This phrase has been used since the first conference of the peace churches in Kansas in 1935.

The definition of &quot;peace churches&quot; is sometimes expanded to include Christadelphians (from 1863) and others who did not participate in the conference of the &quot;historic peace churches&quot; in Kansas in 1935.

The peace churches agree that Jesus advocated nonviolence. Whether physical force can ever be justified in defending oneself is controversial. Most believers adhere strictly to a moral attitude of nonresistance in the face of violence. These churches generally concur that violence on behalf of nations and their governments is contrary to Christian morality, but agree that the teachings of Jesus were to explain the principles of the Kingdom of God rather than and contrasted with the ways of any earthly government.

==History==
Among all Christian denominations, there have always been groups of members who advocate nonviolence, but certain churches have consistently supported it since their foundation. Besides the three historic peace churches, they include the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, Conservative Mennonites, Holdeman Mennonites, Hutterites, Old German Baptist Brethren, Old Order River Brethren, the Brethren in Christ, and others in the Anabaptist tradition; Doukhobors, Molokans, Dunkard Brethren, &quot;Dukh-i-zhizniki&quot;, Bruderhof Communities, Schwenkfelders, Moravians, the Shakers, and even some groups within the Pentecostal movement. The largest Finished Work Pentecostal denomination, the Assemblies of God, abandoned pacifism around the time of the Second World War. These groups have disagreed, both internally and with each other, about the propriety of non-combatant military roles, such as unarmed medical personnel, or performing non-battlefield services that assist nations in wartime, such as manufacturing munitions. One position might argue that Jesus would never object to helping people who are suffering, while another might object that doing so contributes indirectly to violence by freeing other people to engage in it. Most peace churches support alternative service options such as service to refugees or in hospitals, as long as they are not associated with the military.

In America the first conference of historic peace churches was held in 1935 in Kansas. Five years later in Canada, the Conference of Historic Peace Churches was formed in Ontario in 1940, headed by Harold Sherk to represent Mennonite, Brethren, and Quaker churches as they sought exemption from military service.

At one time, active membership in and acceptance of the beliefs of one of the peace churches was required for obtaining conscientious objector status in the United States, and hence exemption from military conscription, or for those already in the military, honorable discharge. But after a series of court rulings, this requirement was dropped. In the United States, one may now claim conscientious objector status based on a personal belief system that need not be Christian, nor even based on religion.

Peace churches, especially those with sufficient financial and organizational resources, have attempted to heal the ravages of war without favoritism. This has often aroused controversy, as when the Quakers sent large shipments of food and medicine to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and to U.S.-embargoed Cuba. The American Friends Service Committee and the Mennonite Central Committee are two charitable denominational agencies set up to provide such healing.

In the 1980s, the Quakers, Brethren, and Mennonites came together to create Christian Peacemaker Teams, an international organization that works to reduce violence and systematic injustice in regions of conflict. This was motivated by the desire for Christians to take peacemaking as seriously as soldiers and governments take war-making.

===Christadelphians, 1863===
The Christadelphians are one of only a small number of churches whose identity as a denomination is directly linked to the issue of Christian pacifism. Although the grouping which later took the name &quot;Christadelphian&quot; had largely separated from the Campbellite movement in Scotland and America after 1848, it was conscription in the American Civil War which caused their local church in Ogle County, Illinois, to register as conscientious objectors in 1863 under the name &quot;Christadelphians.&quot; When the First World War was imminent Christadelphians in the British Empire took the same stance, though frequently faced military tribunals. During the Second World War Christadelphians were exempted and performed civil work – though some of the small number of Christadelphians in Germany were imprisoned and one executed. The position was maintained through the Korean War, Vietnam War and today.

===Doukhobors===
The Doukhobors are a Spiritual Christian denomination that advocate pacifism. On 29 June 1895, the Doukhobors, in what is known as the &quot;Burning of the Arms&quot;, &quot;piled up their swords, guns, and other weapons and burned them in large bonfires while they sang psalms&quot;.

===Holiness Pacifists===
The Emmanuel Association, Reformed Free Methodist Church, Immanuel Missionary Church, Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), First Bible Holiness Church and Christ&#x27;s Sanctified Holy Church are denominations in the holiness movement known for their opposition to war today; they are known as &quot;Holiness Pacifists&quot;. The Emmanuel Association, for example, teaches:
===Seventh-day Adventist Church, 1867===
Adventists had sought and obtained exemption as conscientious objectors in 1864, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church from 1914 has a long history of noncombatancy service within and outside the military. In practice today, as a pastor from the Seventh-day Adventist church comments in an online magazine run by members of the Seventh-Day Adventist church: &quot;Today in a volunteer army a lot of Adventist young men and women join the military in combat positions, and there are many Adventist pastors electing for military chaplaincy positions, supporting combatants and non-combatants alike. On Veteran’s Day, American churches across the country take time to give honor and respect to those who “served their country,” without any attempt to differentiate how they served, whether as bomber pilots, Navy Seals, or Operation Whitecoat guinea pigs. I have yet to see a service honoring those who ran away to Canada to avoid participation in the senseless carnage of Vietnam in their Biblical pacifism.&quot;

===Churches of God (7th day)===
The different groups evolving under the name Church of God (7th day) stand opposed to carnal warfare, based on Matthew 26:52; Revelation 13:10; Romans 12:19–21. They believe the weapons of their warfare to not be carnal but spiritual (II Corinthians 10:3–5; Ephesians 6:11–18).

===Molokans===
The Molokans are a Spiritual Christian denomination that advocate pacifism. They have historically been persecuted for failing to bear arms.

==Partially pacifist groups==

===Community of Christ===
Although non-credal and not explicitly pacifist, the Community of Christ (formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) is emerging as an international peace church through such ministries as the Community of Christ International Peace Award, the Daily Prayer for Peace, and resources to support conscientious objection to war. However, in the United States and worldwide, many church members are active in military service and the church provides active duty chaplaincy for outreach and ministry to military personnel.

===Churches of Christ===
Once containing a relatively large nonviolence faction, Churches of Christ are now more conflicted. Contemporary Churches of Christ, especially those that hold with the teachings of David Lipscomb, tend toward pacifist views. This means that they believe that the use of coercion and/or force may be acceptable for purposes of personal self-defense but that resorting to warfare is not an option open to Christians.

===Fellowship of Reconciliation===
As noted above, there are peace groups within most mainstream Christian denominations. The Fellowship of Reconciliation was set up as an organization to bring together people in these groups and members of the historic peace churches. In some countries, e.g. the United States, it has broadened its scope to include members of other religions or none, and people whose position is not strictly for nonviolence. However, in other countries (e.g., the United Kingdom) it remains essentially an organization of Christian nonviolence.

<doc id="650497" wikidata="Q806283" url="?curid=650497" title="Bandeirantes">
<text>Bandeirantes (; ; singular: bandeirante) were settlers in colonial Brazil who participated in expeditions to expand the colony&#x27;s borders and subjugate indigenous peoples during the early modern period. They played a major role in expanding the colony to the modern-day borders of independent Brazil, beyond the boundaries demarcated by the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. &quot;Bandeirantes&quot; expeditions also involved the capture and subjugation of indigenous peoples. Although the bandeirantes themselves were a product of diverse cultural backgrounds. Darcy Ribeiro, Brazilian anthropologist, historian, sociologist, author and politician, states that the bandeirantes were racially mixed, with interbreeding with indigenous people being common, even among the elite. The families of São Paulo were patrician and polygamous, but Catholic marriage only became consolidated later. The largest flag, by Manuel Preto (a São Paulo bandeirante, born in the second half of the 16th century and died in São Paulo in 1630.) and Antônio Raposo Tavares, in 1629, had 69 whites, 900 mamelucos and 2 thousand indigenous people.

These individuals were often the descendants of indigenous women and Portuguese settlers. Contrary to some portrayals, many bandeirantes were of indigenous, mestiço, or lower-class Portuguese origin. In fact, as noted by historical sources, &quot;Most of the bandeirantes were indigenous people and other poor people from the colony, many women were bandeirantes.&quot; – These bandeirantes were often marginalized or disenfranchised people who found opportunity through these expeditions, which were both a means of survival and a path to personal achievement.

Most &quot;bandeirantes&quot; were based in the region of São Paulo, which was part of the Captaincy of São Vicente from 1534 to 1709 and the Captaincy of São Paulo from 1709 to 1821. The city of São Paulo served as the home base for the most famous &quot;bandeirantes&quot;. Some &quot;bandeirantes&quot; were descended from Portuguese colonists who settled in São Paulo, but most were of &quot;mameluco&quot; descent with both Portuguese and indigenous ancestry. This was due to miscegenation being the norm in colonial Brazilian society, as well as polygamy.

Initially, the bandeirantes aimed to explore and expand the Portuguese colonial territory beyond the boundaries established by the Treaty of Tordesillas. They ventured into unmapped regions in search of economic opportunities, particularly the discovery of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[diamond]]s. Over time, as their expeditions progressed, the bandeirantes also began to capture and enslave indigenous peoples, which became a significant part of their activities. However, their primary goal remained the expansion of territory and the search for resources, which played a major role in shaping the modern borders of Brazil. The bandeirantes spoke a mixture of Portuguese and the Paulista General Language, which influenced the toponyms and place names in the interior of the colony. As they ventured into unmapped regions in search of profit and adventure, the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; expanded the effective borders of the colony. &quot;Bandeirantes&quot; spoke a mixture of Portuguese and the Paulista General Language, which was the main source of toponyms in the Brazilian interior.

==Name==
The term comes from Portuguese &quot;bandeira&quot; or flag, and by extension, a group of soldiers, a detached military unit or a raiding party. In medieval Portugal a &quot;bandeira&quot; was a military unit of 36 soldiers. The words were not used by the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; themselves. They used words like entry (entrada), journey, voyage, company, discovery and rarely, fleet or war. One writer dates &quot;bandeira&quot; from 1635 and &quot;bandeirante&quot; from 1740.

== Background ==

With the treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 the South American continent was divided between Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands. Many Bandeirantes were Mulattos and came from the Portuguese settlement in São Paulo who were sent out to chart and explore the interior of the country. By exploring the interior of the country, Portugal was able to claim land that exceeded the line drawn by the treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 and began to encompass what is today the country of Brazil. Bandeirantes usually numbered anywhere from 50 to several thousand and were sponsored by the wealthy elites. Many of these expeditions into the interior of Brazil set up trading posts and built roads that connected the settlements together.

===Paulistas===
Before there were &quot;bandeirantes&quot; there were Paulistas. Brazil was originally a coastal strip between mountains and sea dominated by slave-worked sugar plantations. When the Portuguese crossed the mountains to the São Paulo plateau they were cut off from the sea and faced a great wilderness to the north and west where they might find their fortunes or die trying. The coastal Portuguese used African slaves while the Paulistas used Indian slaves or workers and many were part-Indian themselves.

==Slavery==
The main focus of the &quot;bandeirantes&quot;&#x27; missions was to capture and enslave native populations. They carried this out by a number of tactics. The bandeirantes usually relied on surprise attacks, simply raiding villages or collections of natives, killing any who resisted, and kidnapping the survivors. Trickery could also be used; one common tactic was disguising themselves as Jesuits, often singing Mass to lure the natives out of their settlements. At the time, the Jesuits had a deserved reputation as the only colonial force that treated the natives somewhat fairly in the Jesuit reductions of the region. If luring the natives with promises did not work, the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; would surround the settlements and set them alight, forcing inhabitants out into the open. At a time when imported African slaves were comparatively expensive, the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; were able to sell large numbers of native slaves at a huge profit due to their relatively inexpensive price. Bandeirantes also teamed up with a local tribe, convincing them that they were on their side against another tribe, and when both sides were weakened the Bandeirantes would capture both tribes and sell them into slavery.

By the 17th century, Jesuit missions had become a favorite target of the expeditions. A &quot;bandeira&quot; that took place in 1628 and was organized by Antônio Raposo Tavares raided 21 Jesuit villages in the upper Paraná Valley, ultimately capturing about 2,500 natives. A &quot;bandeira&quot; tactic was to set native tribes against each other in order to weaken them, and then to enslave both sides.

In 1636, Tavares led a bandeira, composed of 2,000 allied Indians, 900 mamelucos, and 69 white &quot;Paulistas&quot;, to find precious metals and stones and to capture Indians for slavery. This expedition alone was responsible for the destruction of most of the Jesuit missions of Spanish Guayrá and the enslavement of over 60,000 indigenous people. Between 1648 and 1652, Tavares also led one of the longest known expeditions from São Paulo to the mouth of the Amazon river, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, ultimately covering a distance of more than 10,000 kilometers. The expedition traveled to Andean Quito, part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru, and remained there for a short time in 1651. Of the 1,200 men who left São Paulo, only 60 reached their final destination in Belém.

== Relations with Jesuits ==

The Bandeirantes and the Jesuits did not agree on the treatment of the native people. The Jesuits wanted to convert the native population to Christianity while the Bandeirantes wanted to sell the native population into slavery. Jesuit leader father Antonio Ruiz de Montoya would attempt to lead 12,000 natives to safety into Argentina in an attempt to save them from Bandeirantes. With the death of Diego Alfaro by the hands of Bandeirantes a conflict was sure to come between the two groups and it all came to head when Jerónimo Pedroso de Barros and Manuel Pires attacked a Jesuit camp. The Jesuits led by father Pedro Romero had a force of around 4,200 against the Bandeirantes force of about 3,500. Romero would repel the assault and win the day. With the Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750) Spain and Portugal would agree to dismantle the Jesuit missions called the Misiones Orientales. The Jesuits would fight back against this order and would lead to the Guaraní War which saw the Spanish and Portuguese fight against the native Guarani population. Despite early failures due to guerrilla tactics the Spanish and Portuguese would attack and José Joaquín de Viana would defeat Guarani leader Sepé Tiaraju and would go on to destroy the Jesuit mission camps. The battle ended the war and with Portugal expelling the Jesuits from the country in 1759, it ended the relations between the Jesuits and the Bandeirantes.

== Fernão Dias Pais Lemme ==

The bandeirante Fernão Dias was born in São Paulo in 1608 to a well-off family and spent much of his early life as a farmer in Pinheiros before becoming an income inspector in 1626. However, it was 1638 when the one who would go on to be called &quot;The Emerald Hunter&quot; would get his first taste of expedition when he would join Antônio Raposo Tavares on his expedition to the present states of Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. Dias however left on his own expedition in 1644. In an expedition in 1661, in an attempt to find more natives to enslave, Dias explored south of the Anumarana mountain range into the Kingdom of Guaianás. Dias would return in 1665 with 4000 slaves from three different tribes. It was during Dias&#x27;s 1671 expedition that he would receive his nickname, as he would find emeralds in Sabarabuçu. In 1681, Dias died of disease while on an expedition in which he found Tourmaline.

==Gold hunting==
In addition to capturing natives as slaves, &quot;bandeiras&quot; also helped to extend the power of Portugal by expanding its control over the Brazilian interior. Along with the exploration and settlement of this territory the &quot;bandeiras&quot; also discovered mineral wealth for the Portuguese, which they had been previously unable to profit from.

In the 1660s, the Portuguese government offered rewards to those who discovered gold and silver deposits in inner Brazil. So the &quot;bandeirantes&quot;, driven by profit, ventured into the depths of Brazil not only to enslave natives, but also to find mines and receive government rewards. As the number of natives diminished, the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; began to focus more intensely on finding minerals.

These exploration by the Bandeirantes set in motion what would be called the Brazilian Gold Rush of the 1690s. The gold rush would be one of the largest in the world and would produce the largest gold mines in South America. With the discovery of gold by Bandeirantes in the mountains of Minas Gerais. This caused many people from the north of Brazil to go down south in hopes of finding gold.

==Legacy==

The &quot;bandeirantes&quot; were responsible for the discovery of mineral wealth, and, along with the missionaries, for the territorial enlargement of central and southern Brazil. This mineral wealth made Portugal wealthy during the 18th century. As a result of the &quot;bandeiras&quot;, the Captaincy of São Vicente became the basis of the Viceroyalty of Brazil, which would go on to encompass the current states of Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Goiás, part of Tocantins, and both Northern and Southern Mato Grosso. The &quot;bandeirantes&quot; were also responsible for unsteady relations between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire, as they essentially conducted an undeclared war on indigenous residents allied with Spain or the Jesuits. With only a few outlying Spanish settlements surviving and the majority of Jesuit missions overrun, the de facto control by Portugal over most of what is now the Southeast, Southern, and Central West territory of Brazil was recognized by the Treaties of Madrid in 1750 and San Ildefonso in 1777. Additionally, Portugal officially expelled the Jesuits in 1759, further reducing the ability of the Jesuits to fight back.

== 20th and 21st centuries ==

Bandeirantes were an important part of the 1920s independence movement as they became a symbol of Brazilian pride. A large part of this movement was to show the bandeirantes as pure Brazilian and that they represented bravery and their sense of achievement. At this time many poems, paintings, movies, and books were made about bandeirantes. Many statues were raised at this time, including the São Paulo&#x27;s Monumento às bandeiras.

In the 21st century, there have been calls to stop celebrating the bandeirantes. Guards have been deployed in Brazil to protect the statues of bandeirantes from vandalism. The statues have been criticized for celebrating the bandeirantes for their practice of enslaving the native population. This new wave is trying to confront Brazil&#x27;s controversial past and their practice of glorifying slave traders. Calls to take down statues were again intensified with Britain&#x27;s removal of a statue of Edward Colston on June 7, 2020. On July 24, 2021, protesters, in response to Brazilians president Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s nationalist rhetoric, set fire to a statue of Borba Gato in São Paulo. The call for statue removal is not limited to Brazil—other countries in South America have also called for the removal of statues that depict slavery in a positive light.

<doc id="650498" wikidata="Q849345" url="?curid=650498" title="Shaktism">
<text>Shaktism (; ) is a major Hindu denomination in which the deity or metaphysical reality is considered metaphorically to be a woman.

Shaktism involves a galaxy of goddesses, all being regarded as different aspects, manifestations, or personifications of the divine feminine energy called &quot;Shakti&quot;. It includes various modes of worship, ranging from those focused on the most worshipped Durga, to gracious Parvati, and the fierce Kali. After the decline of Buddhism in India, various Hindu and Buddhist goddesses were combined to form the Mahavidya, a pantheon of ten goddesses. The most common forms of the Mahadevi worshipped in Shaktism include: Durga, Kali, Saraswati, Lakshmi, Parvati, and Tripura Sundari. Also worshipped are the various Gramadevatas across the Indian villages.

Shaktism also encompasses various tantric sub-traditions, including Vidyapitha and Kulamārga. Shaktism emphasizes that intense love of the deity is more important than simple obedience, thus showing an influence of the Vaishnavaite idea of passionate relationship between Radha and Krishna as an ideal bhava. Similarly, Shaktism influenced Vaishnavism and Shaivism. The goddess is considered the consort and energy (&quot;shakti&quot;) of the gods Vishnu and Shiva; they have their individual shaktis, Vaishnavi for Vishnu and Maheshvari for Shiva, and consorts Lakshmi and Sati/Parvati. An adherent of Shaktism is called Shakta. In 2020, the World Religion Database (WRD) estimated that Shaktism is the third largest Hindu sect, constituting about 305 million Hindus.

The Sruti and Smriti texts of Hinduism form an important scriptural framework in Shaktism. Scriptures such as the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;, &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot;, &quot;Kalika Purana&quot;, and Shakta Upanishads such as the &quot;Devi Upanishad&quot; are revered. The &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; in particular, is considered in Shaktism to be as important as the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. The Devi is revered in many Hindu temples and is worshipped during various Hindu festivals. The goddess-focused tradition and festivals such as the Durga puja are very popular in the eastern India.

== Origins and history ==

The earliest archaeological evidence of what appears to be an Upper Paleolithic shrine for Shakti worship were discovered in the terminal upper paleolithic site of Baghor I (Baghor stone) in Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The excavations, carried out under the guidance of noted archaeologists G. R. Sharma of Allahabad University and J. Desmond Clark of University of California and assisted by Jonathan Mark Kenoyer and J. N. Pal, dated the Baghor formation to between 9000 BC and 8000 BC. The origins of Shakti worship also may be traced to Indus Valley civilization.

Among the earliest evidence of reverence for the female aspect of the deity in Hinduism is this passage in chapter 10.125 of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, also called the Devi Suktam hymn:

The Vedic literature reveres various goddesses, but far less frequently than the gods Indra, Agni and Soma. Yet, they are declared equivalent aspects of the neutral Brahman, of Prajapati and Purusha. The goddesses often mentioned in the Vedic layers of text include the Ushas (dawn), Vāc (speech, wisdom), Sarasvati (as river), Prithivi (earth), Nirriti (annihilator), Shraddha (faith, confidence). Goddesses such as Uma appear in the Upanishads as another aspect of divine and the knower of ultimate knowledge (Brahman), such as in section 3 and 4 of the ancient &quot;Kena Upanishad&quot;.

Hymns to goddesses are in the ancient Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, particularly in the &quot;Harivamsa&quot; section, which was a late addition (100 to 300 CE) to the work. The archaeological and textual evidence implies, states Thomas Coburn, that the goddess had become as prominent as God in Hindu tradition by about the third or fourth century. The literature on Shakti theology grew in ancient India, climaxing in one of the most important texts of Shaktism called the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;. This text, states C. Mackenzie Brown – a professor of religion, is both a culmination of centuries of Indian ideas about the divine woman, as well as a foundation for the literature and spirituality focussed on the female transcendence in centuries that followed. The &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; is considered in Shaktism to be as important as the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. The &quot;Devi-Mahatmya&quot; is not the earliest literary fragment attesting to the existence of devotion to a goddess figure, states Thomas B. Coburn – a professor of religious studies, but &quot;it is surely the earliest in which the object of worship is conceptualized as goddess, with a capital G&quot;.

== Theology ==

Shaktas conceive the goddess as the supreme, ultimate, eternal reality of all existence, or same as the Brahman concept of Hinduism. She is considered to be simultaneously the source of all creation, its embodiment and the energy that animates and governs it, and that into which everything will ultimately dissolve. Mahadevi said in Devi Upanishad, verse 2, &quot;I am essentially Brahman&quot;.
According to V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar – a professor of Indian history, in Shaktism theology &quot;Brahman is static Shakti and Shakti is dynamic Brahman.&quot;

Shaktism views the Devi as the source, essence, and substance of everything in creation. Its texts such as the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot; states:

Shaktism&#x27;s focus on the Divine Female does not imply a rejection of the male. It rejects masculine-feminine, male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi is considered to be the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the cultural concepts of masculine and the feminine as they exist among practitioners of Shaktism are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of male-female or masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.

The philosophical premise in many Shakta texts, states professor of Religious Studies June McDaniel, is syncretism of Samkhya and Advaita Vedanta schools of Hindu philosophy, called &quot;Shaktadavaitavada&quot; (literally, the path of nondualistic Shakti).

The Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda, remarked thus; about being an actual Shakti worshipper: 
&quot;Do you know who is the real &quot;Shakti-worshipper&quot;? It is he who knows that God is the omnipresent force in the universe and sees in women the manifestation of that Force.&quot; Shakta-universalist Sri Ramakrishna, one of the most influential figures of the Hindu reform movements, believed that all Hindu goddesses are manifestations of the same mother goddess. The 18th-century Shakta bhakti poems and songs were composed by two Bengal court poets, Bharatchandra Ray and Ramprasad Sen, and the Tamil collection Abhirami Anthadhi was composed by Abhirami Bhattar.

=== Scriptures ===
The important scriptures of Shaktism include the &quot;Shakta Upanishads&quot;, as well as Shakta-oriented Upa Puranic literature such as the &quot;Devi Purana&quot; and &quot;Kalika Purana&quot;, the &quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; (from the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;). The &quot;Tripura Upanishad&quot; is historically the most complete introduction to Shakta Tantrism, distilling into its 16 verses almost every important topic in Shakta Tantra tradition. Along with the &quot;Tripura Upanishad&quot;, the &quot;Tripuratapini Upanishad&quot; has attracted scholarly bhasya (commentary) in the second half of 2nd-millennium, such as the work of Bhaskararaya, and Ramanand. These texts link the Shakti Tantra tradition as a Vedic attribute, however this link has been contested by scholars. Scriptures such as the Devi Mahatmya, Devi-Bhagavata Purana, Kalika Purana, and Shakta Upanishads like the Devi Upanishad are particularly revered.

==== Devi Gita ====
The seventh book of the &quot;Srimad Devi-Bhagavatam&quot; presents the theology of Shaktism. This book is called &quot;Devi Gita&quot;, or the &quot;Song of the Goddess&quot;. The goddess explains she is the Brahman that created the world, asserting the Advaita premise that spiritual liberation occurs when one fully comprehends the identity of one&#x27;s soul and the Brahman. This knowledge, asserts the goddess, comes from detaching self from the world and meditating on one&#x27;s own soul.

The &quot;Devi Gita&quot;, such as the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, is a condensed philosophical treatise. It presents the divine female as a powerful and compassionate creator, pervader and protector of the universe. She is presented in the opening chapter of the &quot;Devi Gita&quot; as the benign and beautiful world-mother, called &quot;Bhuvaneshvari&quot; (literally, ruler of the universe). Thereafter, the text presents its theological and philosophical teachings.

The &quot;Devi Gita&quot; describes the Devi (or goddess) as &quot;universal, cosmic energy&quot; resident within each individual. It thus weaves in the terminology of Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. The text is suffused with Advaita Vedanta ideas, wherein nonduality is emphasized, all dualities are declared as incorrect, and interconnected oneness of all living beings&#x27; souls with Brahman is held as the liberating knowledge. However, adds Tracy Pintchman – a professor of Religious Studies and Hinduism, &quot;Devi Gita&quot; incorporates Tantric ideas giving the Devi a form and motherly character rather than the gender-neutral concept of Adi Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta.

=== List of 8 Shakta Upanishads ===
==Principal deities==
Shaktism is a goddess-centric tradition of Hinduism, involving many goddesses, all being regarded as various aspects, manifestations, or personifications of the same supreme goddess Shakti. Shaktas approach the Devi in many forms; however, they are all considered to be but diverse aspects of the one supreme goddess. The primary Devi form worshiped by a Shakta devotee is his or her &quot;ishta-devi&quot;, that is a personally selected Devi. The selection of this deity can depend on many factors such as family tradition, regional practice, guru lineage, and personal resonance.
Some forms of the goddess are widely known in the Hindu world. The common goddesses of Shaktism, popular in the Hindu thought at least by about mid 1st-millennium CE, include Parvati, Durga, Kali, Yogamaya, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Gayatri, Radha, and Sita. 
In the Eastern part of India, after the decline of Buddhism in India, various Hindu and Buddhist goddesses were combined to form the Mahavidya, a pantheon of ten goddesses.

The rarer forms of Devi found among tantric Shakta are the Mahavidyas, particularly Tripura Sundari, Bhuvaneshvari, Tara, Bhairavi, Chhinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi, and Kamala.

Other major goddess groups include the &quot;Sapta-Matrika&quot; (&quot;Seven Mothers&quot;), &quot;who are the energies of different major Gods, and described as assisting the great Shakta Devi in her fight with demons&quot;, and the 64 &quot;Yoginis&quot;. The eight forms of the goddess Lakshmi, Ashtalakshmi; and the nine forms of goddess Durga, the Navadurgas, which are mainly worshipped during the Navaratri festival. Also worshipped regularly are the numerous Gramadevatas across the Indian villages.

==Tantric traditions==

Sub-traditions of Shaktism include &quot;Tantra&quot;, which refers to techniques, practices and ritual grammar involving &quot;mantra&quot;, &quot;yantra&quot;, &quot;nyasa&quot;, &quot;mudra&quot; and certain elements of traditional kundalini yoga, typically practiced under the guidance of a qualified guru after due initiation (&quot;diksha&quot;) and oral instruction to supplement various written sources. There has been a historic debate between Shakta theologians on whether its tantric practices are Vedic or non-Vedic.

The roots of Shakta Tantrism are unclear, probably ancient and independent of the Vedic tradition of Hinduism. The interaction between Vedic and Tantric traditions trace back to at least the sixth century, and the surge in Tantra tradition developments during the late medieval period, states Geoffrey Samuel, were a means to confront and cope with Islamic invasions and political instability in and after the 14th century CE.

Notable Shakta tantras are &quot;Saradatilaka Tantra&quot; of Lakshmanadesika (11th century), &quot;Kali Tantra&quot; (), Yogini Tantra, Sarvanandanatha&#x27;s &quot;Sarvolassa Tantra&quot;, Brahmananda Giri&#x27;s &quot;Saktananda Tarangini&quot; with &quot;Tararahasya&quot; and Purnananda Giri&#x27;s &quot;Syamarahasya&quot; with &quot;Sritattvacintamani&quot; (16th century), Krishananda Agamavagisa&#x27;s &quot;Tantrasara&quot; and Raghunatna Tarkavagisa Bhattacarya &quot;Agamatattvavilasa&quot; (17th century), as well as works of Bhaskaracharya (18th century).

===Vidyāpīṭha===
The Vidyāpīṭha is subdivided into Vāmatantras, Yāmalatantras, and Śaktitantras.

===Kulamārga===
The Kulamārga preserves some of the distinctive features of the Kāpālika tradition, from which it is derived. It is subdivided into four subcategories of texts based on the goddesses Kuleśvarī, Kubjikā, Kālī and Tripurasundarī respectively. The Trika texts are closely related to the Kuleśvarī texts and can be considered as part of the Kulamārga.

==Worship==
Shaktism encompasses a nearly endless variety of beliefs and practices – from animism to philosophical speculation of the highest order – that seek to access the Shakti (Divine Energy or Power) that is believed to be the Devi&#x27;s nature and form. Its two largest and most visible schools are the &quot;Srikula&quot; (family of &quot;Tripura Sundari&quot;), strongest in South India, and the &quot;Kalikula&quot; (family of &quot;Kali&quot;), which prevails in northern and eastern India.

=== Srikula: family of Lalita Tripura Sundari ===
The &quot;Srikula&quot; (family of &quot;Sri&quot;) tradition (&quot;sampradaya&quot;) focuses worship on Devi in the form of the goddess &quot;Lalita-Tripura Sundari&quot;. Rooted in first-millennium. Srikula became a force in South India no later than the seventh century, and is today the prevalent form of Shaktism practiced in South Indian regions such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Tamil areas of Sri Lanka.

The Srikula&#x27;s best-known school is Srividya, &quot;one of Shakta Tantrism&#x27;s most influential and theologically sophisticated movements.&quot; Its central symbol, the &quot;Sri Chakra&quot;, is probably the most famous visual image in all of Hindu Tantric tradition. Its literature and practice is perhaps more systematic than that of any other Shakta sect.

Srividya largely views the goddess as &quot;benign [&quot;saumya&quot;] and beautiful [&quot;saundarya&quot;]&quot; (in contrast to Kalikula&#x27;s focus on &quot;terrifying [&quot;ugra&quot;] and horrifying [&quot;ghora&quot;]&quot; Goddess forms such as Kali or Durga). In Srikula practice, moreover, every aspect of the goddess – whether malignant or gentle – is identified with Lalita.
Srikula adepts most often worship Lalita using the abstract &quot;Sri Chakra&quot; yantra, which is regarded as her subtle form. The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily as part of the worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the &quot;Sri Meru&quot;. It is not uncommon to find a &quot;Sri Chakra&quot; or &quot;Sri Meru&quot; installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – &quot;there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly. But what you see in the temples is not the &quot;srichakra&quot; worship you see when it is done privately.&quot;

The Srividya &quot;paramparas&quot; can be further broadly subdivided into two streams, the &quot;Kaula&quot; (a &quot;vamamarga&quot; practice) and the &quot;Samaya&quot; (a &quot;dakshinamarga&quot; practice). The &quot;Kaula&quot; or &quot;Kaulachara&quot;, first appeared as a coherent ritual system in the 8th century in central India, and its most revered theorist is the 18th-century philosopher Bhaskararaya, widely considered &quot;the best exponent of Shakta philosophy.&quot;

The &quot;Samaya&quot; or &quot;Samayacharya&quot; finds its roots in the work of the 16th-century commentator Lakshmidhara, and is &quot;fiercely puritanical [in its] attempts to reform Tantric practice in ways that bring it in line with high-caste brahmanical norms.&quot; Many Samaya practitioners explicitly deny being either Shakta or Tantric, though scholars argues that their cult remains technically both. The Samaya-Kaula division marks &quot;an old dispute within Hindu Tantrism&quot;.

===Kalikula: family of Kali===
The &quot;Kalikula&quot; (Family of &quot;Kali&quot;) form of Shaktism is most dominant in northeastern India, and is most widely prevalent in West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Odisha, as well as Nepal and Kerala. The goddesses Kubjika, Kulesvari, Chamunda, Chandi, Shamshan Kali (goddess of the cremation ground), Dakshina Kali, and Siddheshwari are worshipped in the region of Bengal to protect against disease and smallpox as well as ill omens. &quot;Kalikula&quot; lineages focus upon the Devi as the source of wisdom (&quot;vidya&quot;) and liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;). The tantric part generally stands &quot;in opposition to the brahmanic tradition,&quot; which they view as &quot;overly conservative and denying the experiential part of religion.&quot;

The main deities of the Kalikula tradition are &quot;Kali&quot;, &quot;Chandi&quot;, &quot;Bheema&quot; and &quot;Durga&quot;. Other goddesses that enjoy veneration are &quot;Tara&quot; and all the other &quot;Mahavidyas&quot;, Kaumari as well as regional goddesses such as &quot;Manasa&quot;, the snake goddesses, &quot;Ṣaṣṭī&quot;, the protectress of children, &quot;Śītalā&quot;, the smallpox goddess, and &quot;Umā&quot; (the Bengali name for Parvati) — all of them, again, considered aspects of the Divine Mother.

In Nepal devi is mainly worshipped as the goddess Bhavani. She is one of the important Hindu deities in Nepal.
Two major centers of Shaktism in West Bengal are Kalighat where the skull of Kali is believed to be worshipped along with her 25 forms. The kali ghat temple is located in Calcutta and Tarapith in Birbhum district. In Calcutta, emphasis is on devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;) to the goddess as &quot;Kali&quot;. Where the goddess (Kali) is seen as the destroyer of evil;

At Tarapith, Devi&#x27;s manifestation as &quot;Tara&quot; (&quot;She Who Saves&quot;) or &quot;Ugratara&quot; (&quot;Fierce Tara&quot;) is ascendant, as the goddess who gives liberation (&quot;kaivalyadayini&quot;). [...] The forms of &quot;sadhana&quot; performed here are more &quot;yogic&quot; and &quot;tantric&quot; than devotional, and they often involve sitting alone at the [cremation] ground, surrounded by ash and bone. There are shamanic elements associated with the Tarapith tradition, including &quot;conquest of the Goddess, exorcism, trance, and control of spirits.&quot;

The philosophical and devotional underpinning of all such ritual, however, remains a pervasive vision of the Devi as supreme, absolute divinity. As expressed by the 19th-century saint Ramakrishna, one of the most influential figures in modern Bengali Shaktism:
===Festivals===
Shaktas celebrate most major Hindu festivals, as well as a huge variety of local, temple- or deity-specific observances. A few of the more important events are listed below:

====Navaratri====

The most important Shakta festival is &quot;Navaratri&quot; (lit., &quot;Festival of Nine Nights&quot;), also known as &quot;Sharad Navaratri&quot; because it falls during the Hindu season of Sharad (September/October/November). This is the festival that worships the Navadurgas, forms of Devi. This festival – often taken together with the following tenth day, known as &quot;Dusshera&quot; or &quot;Vijayadashami&quot; – celebrates the goddess Durga&#x27;s victory over a series of powerful demons described in the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;. In Bengal, the last four days of Navaratri are called Durga Puja, and mark one episode in particular: Durga&#x27;s iconic slaying of Mahishasura (lit., the &quot;Buffalo Demon&quot;). Durga Puja also became the main religio-cultural celebration within the Bengal diaspora in the West (together with Kali and Sarasvati Pujas, if a community enough big and rich).

While Hindus of all denominations celebrate the autumn Navratri festival, Shaktas also celebrate two additional Navratris – one in the spring and one in the summer. The spring festival is known as &quot;Vasanta Navaratri&quot; or &quot;Chaitra Navatri&quot;, and celebrated in the Hindu month of Chaitra (March/April). Srividya lineages dedicate this festival to Devi&#x27;s form as the goddess Tripura Sundari. The summer festival is called &quot;Ashada Navaratri&quot;, as it is held during the Hindu month of Ashadha (June/July). The Vaishno Devi temple in Jammu, with Vaishno Devi considered an aspect of Durga, celebrates Navaratri. &quot;Ashada Navaratri&quot;, on the other hand, is considered particularly auspicious for devotees of the boar-headed Goddess Varahi, one of the seven Matrikas named in the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;.

====Vasant Panchami====
Vasant Panchami is dedicated to Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of arts, skills, intelligence, knowledge, and wisdom. She is the consort of Lord Brahma, the creator.

She is mainly worshipped by students in schools and colleges in India. She was one of the significant deities of Vedic India, where she was worshipped in Gurukuls in ancient times. She embodies sound and voice itself. Vasant Panchami is primarily celebrated in February.

====Diwali and others====

Lakshmi Puja is a part of Durga Puja celebrations by Shaktas, where Laksmi symbolizes the goddess of abundance and autumn harvest. Lakshmi&#x27;s biggest festival, however, is &quot;Diwali&quot; (or &quot;Deepavali&quot;; the &quot;Festival of Lights&quot;), a major Hindu holiday celebrated across India and in Nepal as Tihar. In North India, Diwali marks the beginning of the traditional New Year, and is held on the night of the new moon in the Hindu month of Kartik (usually October or November). Shaktas (and many non-Shaktas) celebrate it as another Lakshmi Puja, placing small oil lamps outside their homes and praying for the goddess&#x27;s blessings. Diwali coincides with the celebration of Kali Puja, popular in Bengal, and some Shakta traditions focus their worship on Devi as Parvati rather than Lakshmi.

&quot;Jagaddhatri Puja&quot; is celebrated on the last four days of the Navaratis, following Kali Puja. It is very similar to Durga Puja in its details and observance, and is especially popular in Bengal and some other parts of Eastern India. &quot;Gauri Puja&quot; is performed on the fifth day after Ganesh Chaturthi, during Ganesha Puja in Western India, to celebrate the arrival of Gauri, Mother of Ganesha where she brings her son back home.

Major Shakta temple festivals are &quot;Meenakshi Kalyanam&quot; and &quot;Ambubachi Mela&quot;. The &quot;Meenakshi Kalyanam&quot; is a part of the Chithirai Thiruvizha festival in Madurai around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of goddess Meenakshi (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva communities join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Parvati in marriage to Shiva.
&quot;Ambubachi Mela&quot; or Ameti is a celebration of the menstruation of the goddess, by hundreds of thousands of devotees, in a festival held in June/July (during the monsoon season) at Kamakhya Temple, Guwahati, Assam. Here the Devi is worshiped in the form of a yoni-like stone, and the site is one of Shakta Pitha or pilgrimage sites in Shaktism.

===Animal sacrifice===
Shakti tradition practices animal sacrifice to revere goddesses such as Kali in many parts of India but particularly in the eastern and Himalayan states of India and Nepal. This is either an actual animal, or a vegetable or sweet dish substitute considered equivalent to the animal. In many cases, Shakti devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, and practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.
In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakti temples, particularly to mark the legend of goddess Durga slaying the buffalo demon. This involves slaying of a goat or a male water buffalo. Animal sacrifice is also an essential component as part of the Kaula tantra school of Shaktism. This practice is rare among Hindus, outside this region.

In Bengal, the animal sacrifice ritual follows the guidelines as seen in texts such as &quot;Mahanirvana Tantra&quot;. This ritual includes selecting the animal, then a priest offers a prayer to the animal, then recites the Gayatri Mantra in its ear before killing it. The meat of the sacrificed animal is then cooked and eaten by the Shakta devotees.

In Nepal, animal sacrifice &quot;en masse&quot; occurs during the three-day-long Gadhimai festival. In 2009 it was speculated that more than 250,000 animals were sacrificed during this event.

In Odisha, during the Bali Jatra, Shakti devotees sacrifice male goats to the goddess Samaleswari in her temple in Sambalpur, Orissa.

The Rajput of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses on Navratri, and formerly offered a sacrifice of a goat to a goddess revered as Kuldevi – a practice that continues in some places. The ritual requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The ritual is directed by a priest. The &quot;Kuldevi&quot; among these Rajput communities is a warrior-pativrata guardian goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.

Animal sacrifice of a buffalo or goat, particularly during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced in parts of South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to a goddess, and is probably related to the myth of goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is Renuka. According to Alf Hiltebeitel – a professor of Religions, History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess - related ritual animal sacrifice found in Gilgamesh epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.

In the 19th century through the early 20th century, Indian laborers were shipped by the British Empire into colonial mining and plantations operations in the Indian ocean and the Caribbean regions. These included a significant amount of Shakta devotees. While instances of Shakta animal sacrifice during Kali puja in the Caribbean islands were recorded between 1850s to 1920s, these were relatively uncommon when compared to other rituals such as temple prayers, community dancing and fire walking.

==Shaktism versus other Hindu traditions==
The tantra practices are secretive, subject to speculations and criticism. Scholars variously attribute such criticism to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias on the part of some observers, as well as unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas. These are some of the reasons many Hindus question the relevance and historicity of Tantra to their tradition. The emphasis in Shaktism that love of the deity is more important than obedience shows an influence of the Vaishnavaite idea of passionate relationship between Radha and Krishna as an ideal bhava. Similarly, Shaktism influenced Vaishnavism and Shaivism. The goddess is considered the consort and energy (&quot;shakti&quot;) of the gods Vishnu and Shiva; they have their individual shaktis, Vaishnavi for Vishnu and Maheshvari for Shiva, and consorts Lakshmi and Sati/Parvati.

Beyond tantra, the Shakta sub-traditions subscribe to various philosophies, are similar in some aspects and differ in others. These traditions compare with Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Smartism as follows:
==Demography==
There is no census data available on demographic history or trends for Shaktism or other traditions within Hinduism. Estimates vary on the relative number of adherents in Shaktism compared to other traditions of Hinduism. According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Shaktism tradition is the smaller group with about 30 million or 3.2% of Hindus. According to a 2020 estimate by the World Religion Database (WRD), hosted at Boston University’s Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs (CURA), Shaktism is the third largest Hindu sect, constituting about 305 million Hindus.

Adherents of Shaktism are referred to as Shaktas. Large shakta communities are particularly found in eastern states, such as West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Tripura with substantial communities also existing in Punjab, Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Central India. In West Bengal Shaktas belong to the upper castes as well as lowest castes and tribes, while the lower middle castes are Vaishnavas.

Gavin Flood states that Shaivism and Shaktism traditions are difficult to separate, as many Shaiva Hindus revere the goddess Shakti regularly. The denominations of Hinduism, states Julius Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals revering gods and goddesses henotheistically, with many Shaiva and Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri (Lakshmi), Parvati, Saraswati and other aspects of the goddess Devi. Similarly, Shakta Hindus revere Shiva and goddesses such as Parvati (such as Durga, Radha, Sita and others) and Saraswati important in Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions.

==Temples and influence==

Shakta temples are found all over South Asia. Many towns, villages and geographic landmarks are named for various forms of the Devi. Major pilgrimage sites of Shaktism are called &quot;Shakti Peethas&quot;, literally &quot;Seats of the Devi&quot;. These vary from 4 to 51.

Some Shakta temples are also found in Southeast Asia, the Americas, Europe, Australia and elsewhere. Examples in the United States include the &quot;Kali Mandir&quot; in Laguna Beach, California; and &quot;Sri Rajarajeswari Peetam&quot;, a &quot;Srividya&quot; temple in rural Rush, New York.

Some feminists and participants in New Age spirituality who are attracted to Goddess worship&quot;, suggest Shaktism is a &quot;symbol of wholeness and healing, associated especially with repressed female power and sexuality.&quot;

===Buddhism===
There has been a significant sharing of ideas, ritual grammar and concepts between Tantric Buddhism (Vajrayana tradition) found in Nepal and Tibet and the Tantric Shakta tradition of Hinduism. Both movements cherish female deities. According to Miranda Shaw, &quot;the confluence of Buddhism and Shaktism is such that Tantric Buddhism could properly be called Shakta Buddhism&quot;.

The Buddhist Aurangabad Caves about 100 kilometers from the Ellora Caves, dated to the 6th to 7th century CE, show Buddhist Matrikas (mother goddesses of Shaktism) next to the Buddha. Other goddesses in these caves include Durga. The goddess iconography in these Buddhist caves is close, but not identical to the Hindu Shakta tradition. The &quot;seven Goddess mothers&quot; are found in other Buddhist caves and literature, such as their discussion in the Buddhist text &quot;Manjusrimulakalpa&quot; and &quot;Vairocanabhisambodhi&quot;.
===Jainism===
In Jainism, ideas similar to Shaktism tradition are found, such as the Vidyadevis and the Shasanadevis.

===Sikhism===
The secondary scripture of Sikhs, &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, includes numerous sections on Shakta goddesses, particularly Chandi – the fierce warrior form of the Hindu goddess. According to Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh – a professor of Religious Studies, the stories about goddess Durga in the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; are reworkings of ancient Shakti mythologies. A significant part of this Sikh scripture is based on the teachings in the Shakta text &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; found in the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; of Hinduism.

<text>U.S. Route 166 (US 166) is a east–west United States highway. This route and US 266 are the only two remaining spurs of historic U.S. Route 66 (which was decommissioned in 1985), since US 666 was renumbered to US 491 in 2003.

US 166 meets the old route of US 66, now designated US 69 Alternate, in Baxter Springs in the southeast corner of Kansas.

==Route description==

===Kansas===
US 166 is an east–west highway that meanders about along the Kansas–Oklahoma state line. The highway&#x27;s western terminus is in South Haven, Kansas at an intersection with US 81, approximately north of the northern terminus of US 177. US 166&#x27;s eastern terminus, which is also shared by US 400, is an intersection with I-44 just inside the Missouri state line, near the point where Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri meet, southwest of Joplin, Missouri near Loma Linda, MO.

About east from its intersection with US 81, the highway intersects with the Kansas Turnpike (I-35) at exit 4. Continuing east about , US 166 crosses the Arkansas River into Arkansas City, where it runs concurrently with US 77 for approximately , splitting off near Parkerfield.

Traveling east of Arkansas City, US 166 turns northeast, arcing above Cowley County Lake Dam and Cedar Vale. US. 166 crosses the Caney River approximately east of Chautauqua County Road 2. It turns south of Sedan approximately east of Chautauqua County Road 14. A business loop connects the main US 166 route with Sedan.

Continuing east from Sedan, about to Coffeyville, US 166 skims through Peru and Niotaze, US 166 crosses the Little Caney River 1.1 miles (1.77 km) to the east of Niotaze and proceeds east to the junction of US 75 near Havana. The two routes turn south for a concurrency. US 166 splits off just north of Caney turning east again through Tyro to Coffeyville. US 166 has a brief concurrency with US 169 beginning at the intersection of Walnut/Paterson Streets and Eleventh Street on the south side of downtown Coffeyville. The highway proceeds east on Eleventh Street, curves to the northeast and becomes Northeast Street. It then proceeds northeasterly past Walter Johnson Park and the Montgomery County Fairgrounds before it crosses the Verdigris River. US 166 will exit from US 169 east of the Verdigris River and proceeds east toward the town of Chetopa

US 166 runs eastward about from Coffeyville bypassing Edna and Bartlett. US 166 passes through Chetopa, where US 166 and US 59 travel concurrently from east of the BNSF Railroad overpass, and proceeds south on Eleventh Street, then turns to the east near the Chetopa ball field. US 166/US 59 will run concurrently along Maple Street into downtown Chetopa. US 59 will then break off on Third Street and proceeds south towards the Kansas-Oklahoma state linesouth of the intersection. Leaving Chetopa, US 166 crosses over the Neosho River and crosses US 69 Alternate, before Baxter Springs.
Heading east from Baxter Springs, US 166 crosses the Spring River. Approximately later, US 166 intersects with US 400. US 166/US 400 then turn sharply southeast for to cross the Missouri state line approximately from the I-44 interchange.

===Missouri===
US 166&#x27;s eastern terminus is its interchange with I-44, from the state line and about from the Oklahoma–Kansas–Missouri tripoint.

==History==

US 166 is an original 1926 route and originally ran from South Haven to Baxter Springs, Kansas. In 1945, it was extended east through Joplin, Missouri, where it paralleled US 66 to Springfield. This extension absorbed Route 38, which had been formed in 1922 from Carthage to west of Springfield and realigned to Joplin in about 1930, with the former route becoming Route 38N and soon US 71 Alternate. In 1966, following the completion of the last section of I-44 in Missouri, the east end of US 166 was truncated back from Springfield to its current terminus. Most sections of US 166 between Joplin and Springfield were not upgraded to Interstate Highway standards and were renumbered as I-44 Business Loops, state highways (such as Route 174) or turned over to local or county jurisdiction.

In a resolution on December 22, 1993, KDOT approved and requested to realign US-166 south of Sedan, and to re-designate the former alignment as US-166 Business. This request was approved by AASHTO in a meeting on April 10, 1994.

==Special routes==

===Sedan business loop===
U.S. Route 166 Business (US-166 Bus.) is a business route of US-166 that serves the city of Sedan. US-166 Bus. begins at US-166 southwest of Sedan and begins travelling northeast. The highway soon crosses Middle Caney Creek and continues northeast. It then intersects K-99 and begins to follow it east. The two routes cross Deer Creek and then enters Sedan as Main Street. US-166 Business and K-99 then turn south onto School Street and soon exit the city. The two routes cross Middle Caney Creek once again as they continue south. After roughly , US-166 Bus. intersects US-166 and ends, as K-99 continues south towards Chautauqua. In a December 22, 1993 resolution, KDOT approved and requested to realign US-166 south of Sedan, and to re-designate the former alignment as US-166 Business. This request was approved by AASHTO in an April 10, 1994 meeting.

Other contests include the National Mandolin Championship, the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship, the National Hammer Dulcimer Championship, the National Mountain Dulcimer Championship, the International Autoharp Championship, the International Fingerstyle Guitar Championship, and an Old Time Fiddle contest. The instrument contests routinely see winners from across the US and abroad.

==Camping and jamming==

There are typically 11,000-15,000 people in attendance, and campers include visitors from many different states and countries. Campsites are not preselected, and campers often line up well in advance of the festival to claim a choice campsite during the &quot;Land Rush&quot;.

Attendees often bring musical instruments, and the event is known for the many and varied campground jam sessions throughout the festival. Campground stages operate well into the night, and include Stage 5, Stage 6, Stage 7, Stage 8, Finetime Stage and Stage 11 (songwriters stage). Performers sometimes appear on campground stages or join jams after finishing their sets on the official stages.

Many bands that began as &quot;Jam Bands&quot; in the campgrounds have been invited to perform at the festival, including Driven, Haymakers, Old Sound, Steelwind, Pretend Friend, Walnut River String Band, the Matchsellers, and the Weda Skirts.

<text>The Bernese Oberland Railway (, BOB) is a narrow-gauge mountain railway in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. It runs, via a &quot;Y&quot; junction at Zweilütschinen to serve Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald from Interlaken. The railway is rack assisted (that is although an adhesion railway, rack and pinion operation is used on steep sections of the line to assist traction).

The BOB is owned by the &quot;Berner Oberland-Bahnen AG&quot;, a company that also owns the Schynige Platte Railway. Through that company it is part of the &quot;Allianz – Jungfrau Top of Europe&quot; marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Wengernalpbahn, Jungfraubahn, Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen–Mürren, Harderbahn, and Firstbahn.

==History==

===Planning===

The first proposals for the Berner Oberland-Bahn, made in 1873, showed a line from Interlaken (at that time Aarmühle) to Zweilütschinen with later options to Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald with starting point at Bönigen. Four years later an 80 years concession was obtained for construction and operation of the line and the company, Berner Oberland-Bahnen AG was founded on 2 November 1888 and construction started the following year.

===Failure of the plan to extend to Visp===
In 1897 the company obtained a concession to construct a 54.7 km line from Lauterbrunnen to Visp, with stations at Stechelberg, Steinberg, Oberborn, and Blatten. It would have involved the construction of a 4,650 m tunnel at 2,200 m elevation under the Breithorn mountain. At Visp it would have had a connection with the Simplon line.

Estimated at 15 million Swiss francs, finance was not forthcoming and by 1906 the plans were abandoned.

===Initial operations===
By 1 July 1890 the gauge line, was opened, using steam traction.

On 18 August 1902 a disastrous fire destroyed the station buildings and goods shed at Grindelwald and these were later rebuilt, surviving to the present day. On 7 October 1908 a new station was added to the system, that at Schwendi on the Grindelwald section.

Steam traction on the line came to an end in 1914, the line becoming electrified at 1500 V d.c., overhead supply, on 17 March of that year, although steam locomotives have been used since that date on special services.

Several changes were made during the 1950s and 1960s, the two most important being in 1957, the construction of an airfield at Interlaken causing the realignment of the line between Wilderswil and Interlaken Ost, but to no detriment and, with a need for servicing and construction facilities on the line a new depot was opened at Zweilütschinen in 1968.

===Recent improvements===
Since that time there has been a need for track capacity to be increased and in 1991 the Wilderswil to Gsteigwiler section was substantially improved. This was followed by the doubling of the Gsteigwiler to Zweilütschinen 4 years later. A bottleneck between Wilderswil and Zweilütschinen was eased when, in 1999, a 2.5 km. double track section was opened between those places meaning that trains could run through without the need to use the passing loop and, as necessary, awaiting the train in the opposite direction.

The BOB has a total length of 23.608 km and is a mixed rack and adhesion railway with four rack and pinion sections, using the Riggenbach rack system, two each on the steep sections of both arms of the line.

===Fatal accident in 2003===
On 7 August 2003 two trains collided head-on on a single track section between Zweilütschinen and Wilderswil, 1 person was killed and 64 injured. The regular train coming down from Zweilütschinen had passed a red signal at the end of the double track section and collided with an extra train near Gsteigwiler. Automatic train stop system ZSI-127 had already been in place but not yet in use, awaiting final completion and approval.

==Operations==
Since 1949 railcars have predominated. Some of the older electric locomotives still survive and are used for special trains. The centre of operations is Zweilütschinen with the depot headquarters and the modern main workshops.

From the introduction of the 1999 timetable, the newly constructed 2.5 km section of dual track between Gsteigwiler and Zweilütschinen allows trains to pass without one having to wait in a loop, off the main line. This means that a half-hour timetable can be operated with only five train compositions. Since 2005, every composition has been equipped with an articulated (three-part) low-floor driving trailer as standard.

Two train compositions are usually coupled together to travel to Zweilütschinen where they are then split. The front portion travels to Lauterbrunnen, the other one to Grindelwald. The motor coach (power unit) is always positioned on the uphill side, a driving trailer (coach with a driver&#x27;s cab) being positioned on the downhill side, to avoid any running round manoeuvres at the terminus stations.

===Stations===
==Timetable==
Like all Swiss railways the BOB operates to a clock – face timetable offering connections from the main line at Interlaken and, at its upper terminals, to the Wengernalpbahn.

Throughout the year the BOB offers a service every hour in each direction on both its lines, the trains leaving Interlaken Ost coupled together and dividing at Zweilütschinen. From mid December to late October, additional trains give a 30-minute service frequency in the morning and afternoon. The last services are often timetabled to be operated by buses.

==Locomotives / Railcars==

* Rebuild 1997–2008 of 304–310 included fitting of equipment for push–pull trains, available from delivery on 311–313
* *) for use on the then-planned but finally not built branch line to Mystery Park
* **) arrived on LEB still numbered 601 on 22 February 2006 and was used together with Bt 702 arriving directly from CJ. LEB finally purchased the two vehicles.

==Rolling stock==
The passenger rolling stock of the line can be divided into that in regular use and that which is historic in nature. Present day passenger stock is painted in striking a blue/yellow livery.

That in regular use can be divided as follows:
*Series A, First class open saloon bogie coaches with 36 seats, numbered 181 and 182, built by SIG in 1971, with 182 being rebuilt in 1999, MU-wired, and 181 sold to SBB, now Zentralbahn A 217.
*Series AB, First/Second Composite bogie saloon open platform coaches with 18 first and 48 second class seats, originally numbered 205–210, built by SIG and delivered, the first two in 1952, the second pair in 1954 and the final pair in 1956. No.209 is the only member to be found on the line and still carrying (October 2009) the Brown and Cream BOB livery. It is not regularly working and can usually be found in Interlaken. (See Preservation Notes (Below).
*Series AB, First/Second Composite bogie saloon coaches with 24 first and 23 second class seats, numbered 211–215, built by SIG and delivered in 1970. All have since been fitted with MU wiring, 211, 213 and 214 sold to Zentralbahn.
*Series AB, First/Second Composite bogie coach with 23 first and 22 second class seats, numbered 221, built by SIG in 1946 and purchased from SBB (Brünig) in 1997, scrapped 2006.
*Series B, Second class open saloon bogie coaches with 72 seats, numbered 232–237, built by SIG between 1952 and 1956. Five members of this group are preserved,(See notes below). Number 232 is still on the line and shown in stock lists but is presently (2009) to be found in Interlaken in Brown/Cream livery.
*Series B, Second class saloon open platform bogie coaches with 64 seats, numbered 241–256, built by SIG between 1967 and 1970, most have been rebuilt but five members have been scrapped. 253–256 originally Zentralbahn. Repainted and MU-wired: 241, 245, 247, 250–256. 242 was MU-wired but is still in Brown/Cream livery and permanently sitting in Interlaken.
*Series B, Second class open saloon bogie coaches with 62 seats, numbered 261 and 262, built by ACMV/SIG and delivered in 1987. MU-wired.

*Series BD, Second class open saloon bogie coaches (40 seats) with guards/parcels compartment, numbered 501–503. These were built by SIG and delivered to the SBB, adapted for push-pull trains as numbers 512-4 / 511-6 / 510-8 in 1968/9. They were rebuilt 2003/4.
*Series BDt, Second class driving trailer (40 seats) with guards/parcel compartment, numbered 401–403, built by ACMV/SIG/BBC in 1987.
*Series ABt, First/Second composite driving trailer with 18 first and 31 second class seats, numbered 411 to 415 inclusive, built for the RBS as ABt 207/3/6/4/5 by FFA/SWP in 1982, being rebuilt by the BOB in 2003–06.
*Series ABt, First/Second composite driving trailer three-car sets with low floor access built by Stadler. These were delivered in 2005 and now form part of every train. They are numbered from 421 to 425 inclusive.
*Series D, Guards/Luggage bogie coach built by SIG in 1971 numbered 531 to 535 inclusive. 532 sold to CJ, 535 scrapped, 532 MU wired, still brown/cream

Historical stock includes the following items, which still carry the former brown/cream livery for coaches and all-over brown for guards/parcels vehicles.
*Series A3, First Class saloon, double verandah with 30 seats, No.102. repairs required to one end due to accident.

*Series C3, Second class open saloon coach numbered 29.
*Series D3, Guards/parcels carriage, numbered 515 and 516, built by SIG in 1911.

Goods stock is a varied collection, much of which would not be out of place in a museum. The earliest wagon shown on the BOB stock list dates from 1888 and was rebuilt by the BOB in 1990. The collection of goods stock totals over 30 assorted wagons, most pre-First World War, many built by SIG and much rebuilt by the BOB over the years. More recently a few additions have been made, most of which are second-hand from CFF/SBB/FFS. The line is home to a snowplough (Series Xrot e) with was built in 1954 by SIG/BBC and rebuilt in 1990 at the BOB workshops.

==Preservation==

Several items of rolling stock have been sold (transferred) to metre gauge preserved railways.
*Series B, Second class open saloon bogie coaches with 52 seats, numbered 201 and 202, built by SIG in 1930 are preserved by the La Traction group. Both were rebuilt, 201 in 1965, 202 in 1972 and both again in 1997.

<text>Ascanio Sobrero (12 October 1812 – 26 May 1888) was an Italian chemist, born in Casale Monferrato. He studied under Théophile-Jules Pelouze at the University of Turin, who had worked with the explosive material guncotton.

He studied medicine in Turin and Paris and then chemistry at the University of Gießen with Justus Liebig, and earned his doctorate in 1832. In 1845 he became a professor at the University of Turin.

During his research he discovered, in 1847, nitroglycerine. He initially called it &quot;pyroglycerine&quot;, and warned vigorously against its use in his private letters and in a journal article, stating that it was extremely dangerous and impossible to handle. In fact, he was so frightened by what he created that he kept it a secret for over a year.

Another of Pelouze&#x27;s students was the young Alfred Nobel, who returned to the Nobel family&#x27;s defunct armaments factory and began experimenting with the material around 1860; it did, indeed prove to be very difficult to discover how to handle it safely. In the 1860s Nobel received several patents around the world for mixtures, devices and manufacturing methods based on the explosive power of nitroglycerine, eventually leading to the invention of dynamite, ballistite and gelignite from which he made a fortune.

Although Nobel always acknowledged and honoured Sobrero as the man who had discovered nitroglycerine, Sobrero was dismayed by the uses to which the explosive had been put and claimed he was almost ashamed by his discovery.

<text>Complex dynamics, or holomorphic dynamics, is the study of dynamical systems obtained by iterating a complex analytic mapping. This article focuses on the case of algebraic dynamics, where a polynomial or rational function is iterated. In geometric terms, that amounts to iterating a mapping from some algebraic variety to itself. The related theory of arithmetic dynamics studies iteration over the rational numbers or the p-adic numbers instead of the complex numbers.

==Dynamics in complex dimension 1==

A simple example that shows some of the main issues in complex dynamics is the mapping formula_1 from the complex numbers C to itself. It is helpful to view this as a map from the complex projective line formula_2 to itself, by adding a point formula_3 to the complex numbers. (formula_2 has the advantage of being compact.) The basic question is: given a point formula_5 in formula_2, how does its &quot;orbit&quot; (or &quot;forward orbit&quot;)
:formula_7
behave, qualitatively? The answer is: if the absolute value |&quot;z&quot;| is less than 1, then the orbit converges to 0, in fact more than exponentially fast. If |&quot;z&quot;| is greater than 1, then the orbit converges to the point formula_3 in formula_2, again more than exponentially fast. (Here 0 and formula_3 are &quot;superattracting&quot; fixed points of &quot;f&quot;, meaning that the derivative of &quot;f&quot; is zero at those points. An &quot;attracting&quot; fixed point means one where the derivative of &quot;f&quot; has absolute value less than 1.)

On the other hand, suppose that formula_11, meaning that &quot;z&quot; is on the unit circle in C. At these points, the dynamics of &quot;f&quot; is chaotic, in various ways. For example, for almost all points &quot;z&quot; on the circle in terms of measure theory, the forward orbit of &quot;z&quot; is dense in the circle, and in fact uniformly distributed on the circle. There are also infinitely many periodic points on the circle, meaning points with formula_12 for some positive integer &quot;r&quot;. (Here formula_13 means the result of applying &quot;f&quot; to &quot;z&quot; &quot;r&quot; times, formula_14.) Even at periodic points &quot;z&quot; on the circle, the dynamics of &quot;f&quot; can be considered chaotic, since points near &quot;z&quot; diverge exponentially fast from &quot;z&quot; upon iterating &quot;f&quot;. (The periodic points of &quot;f&quot; on the unit circle are &quot;repelling&quot;: if formula_12, the derivative of formula_16 at &quot;z&quot; has absolute value greater than 1.)

Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia showed in the late 1910s that much of this story extends to any complex algebraic map from formula_2 to itself of degree greater than 1. (Such a mapping may be given by a polynomial formula_18 with complex coefficients, or more generally by a rational function.) Namely, there is always a compact subset of formula_2, the Julia set, on which the dynamics of &quot;f&quot; is chaotic. For the mapping formula_1, the Julia set is the unit circle. For other polynomial mappings, the Julia set is often highly irregular, for example a fractal in the sense that its Hausdorff dimension is not an integer. This occurs even for mappings as simple as formula_21 for a constant formula_22. The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers &quot;c&quot; such that the Julia set of formula_21 is connected.

There is a rather complete classification of the possible dynamics of a rational function formula_24 in the Fatou set, the complement of the Julia set, where the dynamics is &quot;tame&quot;. Namely, Dennis Sullivan showed that each connected component &quot;U&quot; of the Fatou set is pre-periodic, meaning that there are natural numbers formula_25. Therefore, to analyze the dynamics on a component &quot;U&quot;, one can assume after replacing &quot;f&quot; by an iterate that formula_26. Then either (1) &quot;U&quot; contains an attracting fixed point for &quot;f&quot;; (2) &quot;U&quot; is &quot;parabolic&quot; in the sense that all points in &quot;U&quot; approach a fixed point in the boundary of &quot;U&quot;; (3) &quot;U&quot; is a Siegel disk, meaning that the action of &quot;f&quot; on &quot;U&quot; is conjugate to an irrational rotation of the open unit disk; or (4) &quot;U&quot; is a Herman ring, meaning that the action of &quot;f&quot; on &quot;U&quot; is conjugate to an irrational rotation of an open annulus. (Note that the &quot;backward orbit&quot; of a point &quot;z&quot; in &quot;U&quot;, the set of points in formula_2 that map to &quot;z&quot; under some iterate of &quot;f&quot;, need not be contained in &quot;U&quot;.)

==The equilibrium measure of an endomorphism==
Complex dynamics has been effectively developed in any dimension. This section focuses on the mappings from complex projective space formula_28 to itself, the richest source of examples. The main results for formula_28 have been extended to a class of rational maps from any projective variety to itself. Note, however, that many varieties have no interesting self-maps.

Let &quot;f&quot; be an endomorphism of formula_28, meaning a morphism of algebraic varieties from formula_28 to itself, for a positive integer &quot;n&quot;. Such a mapping is given in homogeneous coordinates by
:formula_32
for some homogeneous polynomials formula_33 of the same degree &quot;d&quot; that have no common zeros in formula_28. (By Chow&#x27;s theorem, this is the same thing as a holomorphic mapping from formula_28 to itself.) Assume that &quot;d&quot; is greater than 1; then the degree of the mapping &quot;f&quot; is formula_36, which is also greater than 1.

Then there is a unique probability measure formula_37 on formula_28, the equilibrium measure of &quot;f&quot;, that describes the most chaotic part of the dynamics of &quot;f&quot;. (It has also been called the Green measure or measure of maximal entropy.) This measure was defined by Hans Brolin (1965) for polynomials in one variable, by Alexandre Freire, Artur Lopes, Ricardo Mañé, and Mikhail Lyubich for formula_39 (around 1983), and by John Hubbard, Peter Papadopol, John Fornaess, and Nessim Sibony in any dimension (around 1994). The small Julia set formula_40 is the support of the equilibrium measure in formula_28; this is simply the Julia set when formula_39.

===Examples===
* For the mapping formula_1 on formula_2, the equilibrium measure formula_37 is the Haar measure (the standard measure, scaled to have total measure 1) on the unit circle formula_11.
* More generally, for an integer formula_47, let formula_48 be the mapping
::formula_49
:Then the equilibrium measure formula_37 is the Haar measure on the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional torus formula_51 For more general holomorphic mappings from formula_28 to itself, the equilibrium measure can be much more complicated, as one sees already in complex dimension 1 from pictures of Julia sets.

===Characterizations of the equilibrium measure===
A basic property of the equilibrium measure is that it is &quot;invariant&quot; under &quot;f&quot;, in the sense that the pushforward measure formula_53 is equal to formula_37. Because &quot;f&quot; is a finite morphism, the pullback measure formula_55 is also defined, and formula_37 is totally invariant in the sense that formula_57.

One striking characterization of the equilibrium measure is that it describes the asymptotics of almost every point in formula_28 when followed backward in time, by Jean-Yves Briend, Julien Duval, Tien-Cuong Dinh, and Sibony. Namely, for a point &quot;z&quot; in formula_28 and a positive integer &quot;r&quot;, consider the probability measure formula_60 which is evenly distributed on the formula_61 points &quot;w&quot; with formula_62. Then there is a Zariski closed subset formula_63 such that for all points &quot;z&quot; not in &quot;E&quot;, the measures just defined converge weakly to the equilibrium measure formula_37 as &quot;r&quot; goes to infinity. In more detail: only finitely many closed complex subspaces of formula_28 are totally invariant under &quot;f&quot; (meaning that formula_66), and one can take the &quot;exceptional set&quot; &quot;E&quot; to be the unique largest totally invariant closed complex subspace not equal to formula_28.

Another characterization of the equilibrium measure (due to Briend and Duval) is as follows. For each positive integer &quot;r&quot;, the number of periodic points of period &quot;r&quot; (meaning that formula_12), counted with multiplicity, is formula_69, which is roughly formula_61. Consider the probability measure which is evenly distributed on the points of period &quot;r&quot;. Then these measures also converge to the equilibrium measure formula_37 as &quot;r&quot; goes to infinity. Moreover, most periodic points are repelling and lie in formula_40, and so one gets the same limit measure by averaging only over the repelling periodic points in formula_40. There may also be repelling periodic points outside formula_40.

The equilibrium measure gives zero mass to any closed complex subspace of formula_28 that is not the whole space. Since the periodic points in formula_40 are dense in formula_40, it follows that the periodic points of &quot;f&quot; are Zariski dense in formula_28. A more algebraic proof of this Zariski density was given by Najmuddin Fakhruddin. Another consequence of formula_37 giving zero mass to closed complex subspaces not equal to formula_28 is that each point has zero mass. As a result, the support formula_40 of formula_37 has no isolated points, and so it is a perfect set.

The support formula_40 of the equilibrium measure is not too small, in the sense that its Hausdorff dimension is always greater than zero. In that sense, an endomorphism of complex projective space with degree greater than 1 always behaves chaotically at least on part of the space. (There are examples where formula_40 is all of formula_28.) Another way to make precise that &quot;f&quot; has some chaotic behavior is that the topological entropy of &quot;f&quot; is always greater than zero, in fact equal to formula_86, by Mikhail Gromov, Michał Misiurewicz, and Feliks Przytycki. 

For any continuous endomorphism &quot;f&quot; of a compact metric space &quot;X&quot;, the topological entropy of &quot;f&quot; is equal to the maximum of the measure-theoretic entropy (or &quot;metric entropy&quot;) of all &quot;f&quot;-invariant measures on &quot;X&quot;. For a holomorphic endomorphism &quot;f&quot; of formula_28, the equilibrium measure formula_37 is the &quot;unique&quot; invariant measure of maximal entropy, by Briend and Duval. This is another way to say that the most chaotic behavior of &quot;f&quot; is concentrated on the support of the equilibrium measure.

Finally, one can say more about the dynamics of &quot;f&quot; on the support of the equilibrium measure: &quot;f&quot; is ergodic and, more strongly, mixing with respect to that measure, by Fornaess and Sibony. It follows, for example, that for almost every point with respect to formula_37, its forward orbit is uniformly distributed with respect to formula_37.

===Lattès maps===
A Lattès map is an endomorphism &quot;f&quot; of formula_28 obtained from an endomorphism of an abelian variety by dividing by a finite group. In this case, the equilibrium measure of &quot;f&quot; is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on formula_28. Conversely, by Anna Zdunik, François Berteloot, and Christophe Dupont, the only endomorphisms of formula_28 whose equilibrium measure is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure are the Lattès examples. That is, for all non-Lattès endomorphisms, formula_37 assigns its full mass 1 to some Borel set of Lebesgue measure 0.

In dimension 1, more is known about the &quot;irregularity&quot; of the equilibrium measure. Namely, define the &quot;Hausdorff dimension&quot; of a probability measure formula_95 on formula_2 (or more generally on a smooth manifold) by
:formula_97
where formula_98 denotes the Hausdorff dimension of a Borel set &quot;Y&quot;. For an endomorphism &quot;f&quot; of formula_2 of degree greater than 1, Zdunik showed that the dimension of formula_37 is equal to the Hausdorff dimension of its support (the Julia set) if and only if &quot;f&quot; is conjugate to a Lattès map, a Chebyshev polynomial (up to sign), or a power map formula_101 with formula_102. (In the latter cases, the Julia set is all of formula_2, a closed interval, or a circle, respectively.) Thus, outside those special cases, the equilibrium measure is highly irregular, assigning positive mass to some closed subsets of the Julia set with smaller Hausdorff dimension than the whole Julia set.

==Automorphisms of projective varieties==
More generally, complex dynamics seeks to describe the behavior of rational maps under iteration. One case that has been studied with some success is that of &quot;automorphisms&quot; of a smooth complex projective variety &quot;X&quot;, meaning isomorphisms &quot;f&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to itself. The case of main interest is where &quot;f&quot; acts nontrivially on the singular cohomology formula_104.

Gromov and Yosef Yomdin showed that the topological entropy of an endomorphism (for example, an automorphism) of a smooth complex projective variety is determined by its action on cohomology. Explicitly, for &quot;X&quot; of complex dimension &quot;n&quot; and formula_105, let formula_106 be the spectral radius of &quot;f&quot; acting by pullback on the Hodge cohomology group formula_107. Then the topological entropy of &quot;f&quot; is
:formula_108
(The topological entropy of &quot;f&quot; is also the logarithm of the spectral radius of &quot;f&quot; on the whole cohomology formula_109.) Thus &quot;f&quot; has some chaotic behavior, in the sense that its topological entropy is greater than zero, if and only if it acts on some cohomology group with an eigenvalue of absolute value greater than 1. Many projective varieties do not have such automorphisms, but (for example) many rational surfaces and K3 surfaces do have such automorphisms.

Let &quot;X&quot; be a compact Kähler manifold, which includes the case of a smooth complex projective variety. Say that an automorphism &quot;f&quot; of &quot;X&quot; has &quot;simple action on cohomology&quot; if: there is only one number &quot;p&quot; such that formula_106 takes its maximum value, the action of &quot;f&quot; on formula_111 has only one eigenvalue with absolute value formula_106, and this is a simple eigenvalue. For example, Serge Cantat showed that every automorphism of a compact Kähler surface with positive topological entropy has simple action on cohomology. (Here an &quot;automorphism&quot; is complex analytic but is not assumed to preserve a Kähler metric on &quot;X&quot;. In fact, every automorphism that preserves a metric has topological entropy zero.)

For an automorphism &quot;f&quot; with simple action on cohomology, some of the goals of complex dynamics have been achieved. Dinh, Sibony, and Henry de Thélin showed that there is a unique invariant probability measure formula_37 of maximal entropy for &quot;f&quot;, called the equilibrium measure (or Green measure, or measure of maximal entropy). (In particular, formula_37 has entropy formula_115 with respect to &quot;f&quot;.) The support of formula_37 is called the small Julia set formula_40. Informally: &quot;f&quot; has some chaotic behavior, and the most chaotic behavior is concentrated on the small Julia set. At least when &quot;X&quot; is projective, formula_40 has positive Hausdorff dimension. (More precisely, formula_37 assigns zero mass to all sets of sufficiently small Hausdorff dimension.)

===Kummer automorphisms===
Some abelian varieties have an automorphism of positive entropy. For example, let &quot;E&quot; be a complex elliptic curve and let &quot;X&quot; be the abelian surface formula_120. Then the group formula_121 of invertible formula_122 integer matrices acts on &quot;X&quot;. Any group element &quot;f&quot; whose trace has absolute value greater than 2, for example formula_123, has spectral radius greater than 1, and so it gives a positive-entropy automorphism of &quot;X&quot;. The equilibrium measure of &quot;f&quot; is the Haar measure (the standard Lebesgue measure) on &quot;X&quot;.

The Kummer automorphisms are defined by taking the quotient space by a finite group of an abelian surface with automorphism, and then blowing up to make the surface smooth. The resulting surfaces include some special K3 surfaces and rational surfaces. For the Kummer automorphisms, the equilibrium measure has support equal to &quot;X&quot; and is smooth outside finitely many curves. Conversely, Cantat and Dupont showed that for all surface automorphisms of positive entropy except the Kummer examples, the equilibrium measure is not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. In this sense, it is usual for the equilibrium measure of an automorphism to be somewhat irregular.

===Saddle periodic points===
A periodic point &quot;z&quot; of &quot;f&quot; is called a &quot;saddle&quot; periodic point if, for a positive integer &quot;r&quot; such that formula_12, at least one eigenvalue of the derivative of formula_16 on the tangent space at &quot;z&quot; has absolute value less than 1, at least one has absolute value greater than 1, and none has absolute value equal to 1. (Thus &quot;f&quot; is expanding in some directions and contracting at others, near &quot;z&quot;.) For an automorphism &quot;f&quot; with simple action on cohomology, the saddle periodic points are dense in the support formula_40 of the equilibrium measure formula_37. On the other hand, the measure formula_37 vanishes on closed complex subspaces not equal to &quot;X&quot;. It follows that the periodic points of &quot;f&quot; (or even just the saddle periodic points contained in the support of formula_37) are Zariski dense in &quot;X&quot;.

For an automorphism &quot;f&quot; with simple action on cohomology, &quot;f&quot; and its inverse map are ergodic and, more strongly, mixing with respect to the equilibrium measure formula_37. It follows that for almost every point &quot;z&quot; with respect to formula_37, the forward and backward orbits of &quot;z&quot; are both uniformly distributed with respect to formula_37.

A notable difference with the case of endomorphisms of formula_28 is that for an automorphism &quot;f&quot; with simple action on cohomology, there can be a nonempty open subset of &quot;X&quot; on which neither forward nor backward orbits approach the support formula_40 of the equilibrium measure. For example, Eric Bedford, Kyounghee Kim, and Curtis McMullen constructed automorphisms &quot;f&quot; of a smooth projective rational surface with positive topological entropy (hence simple action on cohomology) such that &quot;f&quot; has a Siegel disk, on which the action of &quot;f&quot; is conjugate to an irrational rotation. Points in that open set never approach formula_40 under the action of &quot;f&quot; or its inverse.

At least in complex dimension 2, the equilibrium measure of &quot;f&quot; describes the distribution of the isolated periodic points of &quot;f&quot;. (There may also be complex curves fixed by &quot;f&quot; or an iterate, which are ignored here.) Namely, let &quot;f&quot; be an automorphism of a compact Kähler surface &quot;X&quot; with positive topological entropy formula_136. Consider the probability measure which is evenly distributed on the isolated periodic points of period &quot;r&quot; (meaning that formula_12). Then this measure converges weakly to formula_37 as &quot;r&quot; goes to infinity, by Eric Bedford, Lyubich, and John Smillie. The same holds for the subset of saddle periodic points, because both sets of periodic points grow at a rate of formula_139.

<doc id="650522" wikidata="Q42233" url="?curid=650522" title="Sickle">
<text>A sickle, bagging hook, reaping-hook or grasshook is a single-handed agricultural tool designed with variously curved blades and typically used for harvesting or reaping grain crops, or cutting succulent forage chiefly for feeding livestock. Falx was a synonym, but was later used to mean any of a number of tools that had a curved blade that was sharp on the inside edge.

Since the beginning of the Iron Age hundreds of region-specific variants of the sickle have evolved, initially of iron and later steel. This great diversity of sickle types across many cultures can be divided into smooth or serrated blades, both of which can be used for cutting either green grass or mature cereals using slightly different techniques. The serrated blade that originated in prehistoric sickles still dominates in the reaping of grain and is even found in modern grain-harvesting machines and in some kitchen knives.

== History ==
=== Pre-Neolithic ===

The development of the sickle in Mesopotamia can be traced back to times that pre-date the Neolithic Era. Large quantities of sickle blades have been excavated in sites surrounding Israel that have been dated to the Epipaleolithic era (18000-8000 BC). Formal digs in Wadi Ziqlab, Jordan have unearthed various forms of early sickle blades. The artifacts recovered ranged from in length and possessed a jagged edge. 
This intricate ‘tooth-like’ design showed a greater degree of design and manufacturing credence than most of the other artifacts that were discovered. Sickle blades found during this time were made of flint, straight and used in more of a sawing motion than with the more modern curved design. Flints from these sickles have been discovered near Mt. Carmel, which suggest the harvesting of grains from the area about 10,000 years ago.

=== Neolithic ===
The sickle had a profound impact on the Agricultural Revolution by assisting in the transition to farming and crop based lifestyle. It is now accepted that the use of sickles led directly to the domestication of Near Eastern Wild grasses. Research on domestication rates of wild cereals under primitive cultivation found that the use of the sickle in harvesting was critical to the people of early Mesopotamia. The relatively narrow growing season in the area and the critical role of grain in the late Neolithic Era promoted a larger investment in the design and manufacture of sickle over other tools. Standardization to an extent was done on the measurements of the sickle so that replacement or repair could be more immediate. It was important that the grain be harvested at the appropriate time at one elevation so that the next elevation could be reaped at the proper time. The sickle provided a more efficient option in collecting the grain and significantly sped up the developments of early agriculture.

===Bronze Age===
The sickle remained common in the Bronze Age, both in the Ancient Near East and in Europe. Numerous sickles have been found deposited in hoards in the context of the European Urnfield culture (e.g. Frankleben hoard), suggesting a symbolic or religious significance attached to the artifact.

In archaeological terminology, Bronze Age sickles are classified by the method of attaching the handle. E.g. the knob-sickle (German &quot;Knopfsichel&quot;) is so called because of a protruding knob at the base of the blade which apparently served to stabilize the attachment of the blade to the handle.

===Iron Age===

The sickle played a prominent role in the Druids&#x27; Ritual of oak and mistletoe as described from a single passage in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;:
Due to this passage, despite the fact that Pliny does not indicate the source on which he based this account, some branches of modern Druidry (Neodruids) have adopted the sickle as a ritual tool.

=== Americas ===

Indigenous sickles have been discovered in southwest North America with unique design. There is evidence that Kodiak islanders had for cutting grass &quot;sickles made of a sharpened animal shoulder blade&quot;. The artifacts found in present-day Arizona and New Mexico resemble curved tools that were made from the horns of mountain sheep. A similar site discovered sickles made from other material such as the Caddo Sickle, which was made from a deer mandible. Scripture from early natives document the use of these sickles in the cutting of grass. The instruments ranged from tip to haft. Several other digs in eastern Arizona uncovered wooden sickles that were shaped in a similar fashion. The handles of the tools help describe how the tool was held in such a way so that the inner portion that contained the cutting surface could also serve as a gathering surface for the grain. Sickles were sharpened by scraping a shape beveled edge with a coarse tool. This action has left marks on artifacts that have been found. The sharpening process was necessary to keep the cutting edge from being dulled after extended use. The edge is seen to be quite highly polished, which in part proves that the instrument was used to cut grass. After collection, the grass was used as material to create matting and bedding. The sickle in general provided the convenience of cutting the grass as well as gathering in one step. In modern times, the sickle is being used in South America as tool to harvest rice. Rice clusters are harvested using the instrument and left to dry in the sun.

== Nepal ==
Called Hasiya (or Aasi), a sickle is very common in Nepal as the most important tool for cutting used in the kitchen and in the fields. Hasiya is used in the kitchen in many villages of Nepal where its used to cut vegetables during food prep. The handle of Hasiya (made of wood) is held pressed by the toe of one&#x27;s foot and the curve inverted so vegetables can be cut with two hands while rocking the vegetable. Outside of home, Hasiya is used for harvesting.

Hasiya have traditionally been made by local blacksmiths in their charcoal foundries that use leather bellows to blow air. Sharpening of the Hasiya is done by rubbing the edges against a smooth rock or taken back to the blacksmith. Sharpening of the Hasiya is generally done during the beginning of the harvesting season.

Bigger Hasiya is called Khurpa (or Khoorpa) where the curve is less pronounced, is much heavier and is used to sever branches of trees with leaves (for animal feed), chop meat etc. The famous Nepali Khukuri is also a type of sickle where the curve becomes least visible.

Carrying around a sharp and naked Hasiya or Khurpa is unsafe. So Nepalis have traditionally built a cover/holder for it called &quot;Khurpeto&quot; (meaning Khurpa holder in Nepali). It could be a simple piece of wood with a hole big enough to slide the blade of Hasiya inside or could be an intricately carved piece of round wood slung around one&#x27;s waist with a string made of plants (called &quot;hatteuri&quot;). Nowadays though many use cotton, jute or even cloth strings as a replacement of hatteuri which is not easy to find.
== Serrated &quot;Simple&quot; or &quot;toothed&quot; sickles ==

The genealogy of sickles with serrated edge reaches back to the Stone Age, when individual pieces of flint were first attached to a &quot;blade body&quot; of wood or bone. (The majority among the well-documented specimens made later of bronze are smooth-edged.) Nevertheless, teeth have been cut with hand-held chisels into iron, and later steel-bladed sickles for a long time. In many countries on the African continent, Central and South America as well as the Near, Middle and Far East this is &quot;still&quot; the case in the regions within these large geographies where the traditional village blacksmith remains alive and well.

England appears to have been the first to develop the &quot;industrial&quot; process of serration-making. Then, by 1897, the Redtenbacher Company of Scharnstein, in Austria—at that time the largest scythe maker in the world—designed its own machine for the job, becoming the only Austrian source of serrated sickles. In 1942, its recently acquired sister company Krenhof also began to produce these. In 1970, a year before the sickle production branch of Redtenbacher was sold to Ethiopia, they were still making 1.5 million of the serrated sickles per year, predominately for market in Africa and Latin America. There were other enterprises in Austria, of course, who produced the smoothed-edged sickles for centuries. The last of the classical &quot;round&quot; versions were forged until the mid-1980s and machined until 2002.

While in Central Europe the smooth-edged sickle—either forged or machined (alternately referred to as &quot;stamped&quot;) - has been the only one used (and in many regions the only one known), the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily and Greece long had fans of both camps. The many small family-owned enterprises in what is now Italy, Portugal and Spain produced sickles in both versions, with the teeth on the serrated models being hand-cut, one at a time, until the mid-20th century. 
The Falci Co. of Italy (established in 1921 as a union of several formerly independent forges) developed its own unique method of &quot;industrial scale&quot; serrated sickle production in 1965. Their innovations, which included &quot;tapered&quot; blade cross section (thicker at the back - for strength - gradually thinning towards the edge - for ease of penetration) were later adopted by Europe&#x27;s largest sickle producer in Spain as well as, more recently, a company in India.
== Use ==
The inside of the blade&#x27;s curve is sharp, so that the user can either draw or swing it against the base of the crop, catching the stems in the curve and slicing them at the same time. The material to be cut may be held in a bunch in the other hand (for example when reaping), held in place by a wooden stick, or left free. When held in a bunch, the sickle action is typically towards the user (left to right for a right-handed user), but when used free the sickle is usually swung the opposite way. Other colloquial/regional names for principally the same tool are: grasshook, swap hook, rip-hook, slash-hook, reaping hook, brishing hook or bagging hook.

A serrated sickle was used for harvesting wheat, the ears being held bunched up in the free hand as described above. After this the straw was cut with a scythe. Oats and barley on the other hand were simply scythed. The reason for this is that wheat straw, unlike that of oats or barley, whose softer straw was suitable only for bedding or fodder, was a valuable crop, used for thatching, and subjecting it to the battering of a flail would have rendered it useless for this purpose.

The blades of sickle models intended primarily for the cutting of grass are sometimes &quot;cranked&quot;, meaning they are off-set downwards from the handle, which makes it easier to keep the blade closer to the ground. Sickles used for reaping do not benefit by this feature because cereals are usually not cut as close to the ground surface. Instead, what distinguishes this latter group is their often (though not always) serrated edges.

A blade which is used regularly to cut the silica-rich stems of cereal crops acquires a characteristic sickle-gloss, or wear pattern.

===As a weapon===
Like other farming tools, the sickle can be used as an improvised bladed weapon. Examples include the Japanese kusarigama and kama, the Chinese chicken sickles, and the makraka of the Zande people of north central Africa. Paulus Hector Mair, the author of a German Renaissance combat manual also has a chapter about fighting with sickles. It is particularly prevalent in the martial arts of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. In Indonesia, the native sickle known as &quot;celurit&quot; or &quot;clurit&quot; is commonly associated with the Madurese people, used for both fighting and as a domestic tool.

===Other uses===
* The hammer and sickle is a communist symbol representing proletarian solidarity, a union between the peasantry and the urban working class. It was first adapted during the Russian Revolution, the hammer representing the industrial workers, and the sickle representing the farmers/peasants.
* The emblem of the Grim Reaper, who is sometimes portrayed as carrying a sickle rather than the more traditional scythe.
*Pliny the Elder reports that golden sickles were used in Druidic rituals.
*Paulus Hector Mair&#x27;s Manuscript Dresd. C 93 includes a section regarding the martial application of the sickle.
*Three (or two) entwined sickles were the heraldic badge of the medieval Hungerford family. See also Hungerford knot.

== Bagging hook ==

A &quot;bagging hook&quot;, &quot;badging hook&quot;, &quot;fagging hook&quot;, &quot;reap hook&quot; or &quot;rip hook&quot;, is a large sickle usually with an offset handle so that the user&#x27;s knuckles do not make contact with the ground. The Oxford dictionary gives the definition of the word to bag, or badge, as the cutting of grain by hand. The blade is heavier than that of a normal sickle and always without serrated blades. It is usually about wide with an open crescent shaped blade approx across. It developed from the sickle in most parts of Britain during the mid to late 19th century, and was in turn replaced by the scythe, later by the reaping machine and subsequently the swather. It was still used when the corn was bent over or flattened and the mechanical reaper was unable to cut without causing the grain to fall from the ears and wasting the crop.

It was also used in lieu of the bean hook or pea hook for cutting field beans and other leguminous crops that were used for fodder and bedding for livestock.

Sometimes confused with the heavier and straighter billhook used for cutting wood or laying hedges. While the scythe or bagging hook blade was heavy enough to remove young growth instead of, say, shears for clipping a hedge, it was not strong enough to cut woody material for which the stronger, similarly shaped, but longer handled, staff hook was used. Many variations in blade shape were used in different parts of England and known under a variety of names. Its close relations in shape and usage are the grass hook and the reap hook.

<doc id="650524" wikidata="Q99649" url="?curid=650524" title="Lauterbrunnen–Mürren Mountain Railway">
<text>The Lauterbrunnen–Mürren Mountain Railway (, BLM, also known as Mürrenbahn) is a hybrid transport system in the Bernese Oberland area of Switzerland, which connects the villages of Lauterbrunnen and Mürren. The system consists of a connected aerial cableway, also known as the Grütschalpbahn, and an adhesion worked mountain railway. The cableway replaced a funicular, on the same route, in 2010.

The line provides a vital passenger and goods link to the resort village of Mürren, which is situated above the cliffs of the Lauterbrunnen Valley and has poor road access. It also commands a view of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau mountains across the depths of that valley.

The line is owned by the &quot;Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen-Mürren AG&quot;, a subsidiary of the &quot;Jungfraubahn Holding AG&quot;, a holding company that also owns the Wengernalpbahn, Jungfraubahn, Harderbahn, and Firstbahn. Through that holding company it is part of the &quot;Allianz - Jungfrau Top of Europe&quot; marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Berner Oberland-Bahn and Schynige Platte-Bahn.

==History==

The key milestones in the history of the line are:

*1887 Concession obtained for the construction of the railways.
*1889 The company is formed and construction starts.
*1891 Railway opens. The planned opening on 1 June is delayed until 14 August due to a derailment.
*1902 The funicular railway is converted from water gravity power to electric power .
*1910 First winter operations started.
*1912 Replacement of the locomotives on the Mürren to Grütschalp section by motor coaches (type BDe 2/4).
*1949 New vehicles and rope are installed on the Lauterbrunnen to Grütschalp section.
*1965 The new station at Mürren is opened.
*1994 The freight loading operations at Grütschalp are rebuilt.
*2006 Last operation of the funicular from Lauterbrunnen to Grütschalp was on 23 April and the first operation of the replacement cable car was on 16 December.

==Operation==
===Route===

The BLM commences from Lauterbrunnen, using a terminus that is directly opposite the platforms of the Berner Oberland-Bahn (BOB) to Interlaken, and the Wengernalpbahn (WAB) to Kleine Scheidegg and Grindelwald. The first section of the line is an aerial cableway that rises in a distance of . The cableway follows the line of the funicular that preceded it, and the remains of the funicular are visible at many points.

The aerial cableway and railway connect at Grütschalp station, where both lines are within a single building, which also contains the line&#x27;s workshop. A complex transfer machine in the station is used to transfer goods between the two sections and is well used since road access to Mürren is virtually impossible. The same machine was used to transfer goods between the funicular and rail, and has been retained for use with the cable car.

From Grütschalp to Mürren the line is continued as a long narrow gauge electric railway, which rises . Through most of its length, the rail line commands a view of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau across the depths of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. The railway has a single intermediate calling point, at Winteregg station, and runs to a terminus at Mürren station, where the platforms used by passengers are enclosed within a modern station building. Just before the station is reached, the line passes a large freight depot, used in the carriage of freight to Mürren.

===Cable car===

The cable car section of the line is operated by a single cable car, which shuttles between Lauterbrunnen and Grütschalp with a journey time of 4 minutes. The car has an upper passenger level, carrying up to 100 passengers, and a lower level capable of carrying 6 tonnes of freight. The cable car is scheduled with the railway to provide a through journey frequency of between two and four services per hour.

===Rail infrastructure===

The rail line is single-track, with a passing loop at Winteregg station. It has a track gauge of and is electrified at 550 V DC supplied by overhead line. The line is operated using rail adhesion only, and has a maximum gradient of 5%. The former funicular shared the same track gauge, enabling the use of the funicular to transfer rolling stock to and from the electric railway.

The rail section is operated by single electric railcars, often towing or pushing a flat car for goods, with a journey time of 14 minutes. The railway is scheduled with the cable car to provide a through journey frequency of between two and four services per hour.

===Rail vehicles===
The rail line uses the following self-propelled vehicles:

In addition there are four low-floor flat cars, which are pushed or pulled by the passenger cars and carry demountable bodies that can be transferred to the cable car, and a number of unpowered works vehicles.

==Recent developments==
In order to meet legislative requirement for disabled access, the current fleet of trains have been replaced with modern low-floor vehicles. In September 2019 it was announced that &quot;Jungfraubahn Holding AG&quot; had awarded Stadler Rail at Bussnang a contract to supply three trainsets for at a cost of 17.3m Swiss francs. In addition, Mürren railway station, other stations and the Grütschalp workshop will be modernised. The first car of the three trainsets was delivered in November 2023, and the second on 13 May 2024.

<doc id="650526" wikidata="Q44961" url="?curid=650526" title="Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria">
<text>Charles Theodore (; 11 December 1724 – 16 February 1799) was a German nobleman of the Sulzbach branch of the House of Wittelsbach. He became Count Palatine of Sulzbach at the age of six following the death of his father Johann Christian in 1733. With the death of his cousin, Charles III Philip, he became Prince-elector and Count Palatine of the Rhine in 1742, being eighteen. In his fifties, he became Prince-Elector of Bavaria at the death of another cousin, Maximilian III Joseph, in 1777.

==Family and ascent==
Charles Theodore was born into Palatinate-Sulzbach branch of the House of Wittelsbach. His father was Johann Christian, who later became Count Palatine of Sulzbach. His mother was Marie-Anne-Henriette-Leopoldine de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Margravine of Bergen op Zoom, a grandniece of Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne. He was born in Drogenbos near Brussels and educated in Mannheim.

Charles Theodore was the Margrave of Bergen op Zoom from 1728 onwards. He then succeeded his father as Count Palatine of Sulzbach in 1733 and inherited the Electoral Palatinate and the duchies of Jülich and Berg in 1742, with the death of Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine. To strengthen the union of all lines of the Wittelsbach dynasty Charles III Philip had organised a wedding on 17 January 1742 when his granddaughter Elizabeth Augusta was married to Charles Theodore and her sister Maria Anna to the Bavarian prince Clement.

As reigning prince-elector of the Palatinate, Charles Theodore founded an academy of science, stocking up the museums&#x27; collections and supporting the arts. When Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria died in 1777, Charles Theodore became also elector and duke of Bavaria and moved to Munich.

==Bavarian succession==

Charles Theodore did not immediately take up his new title. He had several mistresses and many illegitimate children. However, those children could inherit neither the Electorate of Bavaria nor that of the Palatinate; Charles Theodore needed territory that he could bequeath to his illegitimate children.

On 3 January 1778, shortly after the death of Max Joseph, Charles Theodore signed an agreement with Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor to exchange southern Bavaria for part of the Austrian Netherlands.

The plan was strongly opposed by Maria Anna Sophia of Saxony, the widow of Max Joseph, and Charles Theodore&#x27;s cousin Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, the head of the House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld and the next heir of Bavaria and the Palatinate. They were supported by Frederick II of Prussia and most of the German minor states.

The ensuing diplomatic crisis led to the War of the Bavarian Succession, which was ended by the Peace of Teschen (1779). Charles Theodore accepted the Bavarian succession but agreed that his illegitimate descendants could not inherit Bavaria. Austria acquired the Innviertel, a part of Bavaria in the basin of the Inn River.

Charles Theodore had only one son, Franz Ludwig Josef, with his wife, Countess Elizabeth Augusta of Sulzbach, who died a day after birth. His wife died in 1794. In 1795, he married Maria Leopoldine of Austria-Este, Joseph&#x27;s niece, but they had no children. A second proposal to exchange Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands in 1784 also failed as Frederick II of Prussia initiated the Fürstenbund.

When Charles Theodore died, Bavaria and the Palatinate passed to his cousin, Max Joseph, Duke of Zweibrücken, the younger brother of Charles August, who had died in 1795.

In 1989, Marvin E. Thomas argued in &quot; Karl Theodor and the Bavarian Succession, 1777–1778&quot; that Charles Theodore had wanted to maintain possession of his new territory, as is shown in his diplomatic correspondence. It is more widely understood that Charles Theodore continued the despotic and expensive habits he had developed as Elector Palatine.

===Rule as elector of Bavaria===

Charles Theodore never became popular as a ruler in Bavaria, according to his critic Lorenz von Westenrieder. He attempted, without success, to exchange the electoral lands of Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands and a royal crown, and he never managed to control the mounting social tensions in Bavaria. After a dispute with Munich&#x27;s city council, he even moved the electoral residence in 1788 to Mannheim but returned only one year later.

In 1785, he appointed the American Loyalist exile Benjamin Thompson as his aide-de-camp and chamberlain. Over the next 11 years, Thompson reformed the Bavarian Army and many aspects of the state, rose to high ministerial rank with Charles Theodore&#x27;s backing and became Count von Rumford.

Charles Theodore is also known for disbanding Adam Weishaupt&#x27;s order of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; in 1785.

In 1794, the French Revolutionary Army occupied the Duchy of Jülich; in 1795, they invaded the Palatinate; and in 1796, they marched towards Bavaria. Charles Theodore begged Francis II for help that would have made Bavaria a puppet state of Austria. When he died of a stroke in Munich in 1799, the population in Munich celebrated for several days. He is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich.

Despite the mutual dislike and distrust between the elector and his Bavarian subjects, Charles Theodore left a distinctive mark on the city of Munich. It was during his reign that the &quot;English Garden&quot;, Munich&#x27;s largest park, was created, and the city&#x27;s old fortifications were dismantled to make place for a modern, expanding city. One of Munich&#x27;s major squares, &quot;Karlsplatz&quot;, is named after Charles Theodore. Munich natives, however, seldom use that name, calling the square instead &quot;Stachus&quot;, after the pub &quot;Beim Stachus&quot; that was located there until construction work for Karlsplatz began, mainly because Charles Theodore, as noted above, never enjoyed the popularity in Bavaria that he enjoyed in the Palatinate.

==Character==

Charles Theodore was more interested in arts and philosophy than in politics. The British Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle referred to him as a &quot;poor idle creature, of purely egoistical, ornamental, dilettante nature; sunk in theatricals, bastard children and the like; much praised by Voltaire, who sometimes used to visit him; and Collini, to whom he [Charles Theodore] is a kind master.&quot;

The French foreign minister, Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, knew him and described his foibles even more succinctly:
:Although by nature intelligent, he has never succeeded in ruling by himself; he has always been governed by his ministers or by his father-confessor or (for a time) by the [E]lectress [his wife]. This conduct has increased his natural weakness and apathy to such a degree that for a long time he has had no opinions save those inspired in him by his entourage. The void which this indolence has left in his soul is filled with the amusements of the hunt and of music and by secret liaisons, for which &quot;His Electoral Majesty&quot; has at all times had a particular penchant.
In the course of his career, Charles Theodore acquired a celebrated secretary when the Florentine noble, Cosimo Alessandro Collini (1727–1806), who had been Voltaire&#x27;s secretary, accepted his patronage and remained in the Palatinate. Although Charles Theodore certainly wished to acquire more territory, he had only illegitimate natural sons and so he preferred territory that he could dispose of through his testament, rather than territory encumbered by a legal entailment that he could pass only to a legitimate son.

==Cultural legacy==
Charles Theodore was a great lover of the arts, including drama and especially music. His Mannheim court orchestra was considered one of the finest in its time. The Mannheim School (including composer Christian Cannabich and conductor Johann Stamitz) did groundbreaking work that the celebrated Wiener Klassik would later draw upon. Mozart applied for a position with the Mannheim orchestra in 1777, but was turned down, as the court was about to move to Munich. In 1780, Charles Theodore commissioned &quot;Idomeneo&quot; from the composer. Mozart quotes him as saying &quot;No music has ever made such an impression on me. It is magnificent.&quot;

In keeping with the customs of the time, an Italian opera company as well as a troupe of French actors were employed at Mannheim, each performing in their respective tongues. Later, the &quot;Nationaltheater&quot; (national theatre) was established, one of the first theatres in Germany to exclusively showcase plays in the native tongue (most notably, the first staging of Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Die Räuber&quot; in 1782).

In the visual arts, a massive collection of plaster casts taken from celebrated antique works was assembled at Mannheim. The pre-existing Düsseldorf gallery, including many works by Rubens, was first transferred to Mannheim, then to Munich, where it was later incorporated in the Alte Pinakothek. While none of the Mannheim painters are particularly notable today (with the possible exception of Kobell, primarily a master of landscapes), the elector had several highly talented sculptors at his disposal, among them Peter Anton von Verschaffelt, Peter Simon Lamine and Konrad Linck. Linck also distinguished himself as a designer of porcelain figurines at Frankenthal.

Charles Theodore&#x27;s chief architect Nicolas de Pigage was charged to complete the Mannheim Palace, design the Schlosstheater and the gardens at Schwetzingen Palace (including numerous pavilions, among them several artificial &quot;Roman&quot; ruins and a &quot;mosque&quot;) as well as Benrath palace. While these works are in a pure contemporary French style (marked by the transition from late Baroque to early classicism), some of the other architects employed by Charles Theodore were proponents of a more Italianate style. This mixture of influences is, in fact, typical of many German courts of the period. Charles Theodore was also responsible for the construction of the Old Bridge in Heidelberg, which bears his name as the &quot;Karl-Theodor-Brücke&quot;.

Charles Theodore liked to style himself as a prince of peace, in contrast to other princes like his chief political opponent, the great warrior Frederick the Great of Prussia. Allegorically, Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom and protectress of the arts, is often depicted as a stand-in for the elector himself. This self-view is best summed up in the inscription of a small monument at Schwetzingen:

&quot;A field of war and death of Romans and Germans has been discovered, through the unearthing of weapons, urns and bones, in the year 1765. – To the arts of peace, which are the sole joys of his life, the elector Charles Theodore has dedicated this spot, excavated to the height of seven feet, and had this monument erected in 1768.&quot;
==Family==
===Marriages and children===
On 17 January 1742, in Mannheim, he married Elisabeth Auguste, daughter of Count Palatine Joseph Charles of Sulzbach and his consort Countess Palatine Elizabeth Augusta Sophie of Neuburg. There was one child of this marriage who died in infancy, Francis Louis Joseph (28 – 29 June 1761).

On 15 February 1795, in Innsbruck, he married Archduchess Maria Leopoldine of Austria-Este. There were no children of this marriage.

<text>The Copland River is a river on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It flows for from its headwaters in the Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana to its confluence with the Karangarua River.

The headwaters of the Copland lie only northwest of Aoraki / Mount Cook in a valley overlooked by the peaks of Mount Sefton and Dilemma Peak. A popular tramping track known as the Copland Track follows the river and leads to the Welcome Flat hot springs. The track leads onto the Copland Pass and the Copland Glacier.

The river lies within the Westland Tai Poutini National Park.

<text>Peterborough ware is a decorated British Neolithic pottery style of the early to middle English Neolithic. Named after Peterborough, the nearest city to where the style was first discovered, it is found in the region of South-East England and East Anglia. it is known for the impressed pits made by bone or wood implements in its sides. Whipped cord was also used to make circular &#x27;maggot&#x27; patterns. Ebbsfleeet ware, Fengate ware and Mortlake ware have been identified as subdivisions of Peterborough ware.

The term was introduced by R.A. Smith based on examples found at Fengate, near Peterborough. It originally referred to all neolithic impressed ware, without restricting by location, but now primarily refers to finds of this type in southern and eastern England.

The earliest form of Peterborough ware is known as Ebbsfleet style and had minimal decoration, although this later became more complex. Peterborough ware may have evolved from the earlier Grimston-Lyles Hill ware, around 3500 BC. Later varieties are known as Mortlake and Fengate sub-styles although the sequential chronological scheme of evolution from Ebbsfleet, through Mortlake to Fengate established by Smith (1956), has been called into question by a reading of associated radiocarbon data (Kinnes and Gibson 1997). While this reading suggests all three subgroups were actually more or less contemporary, current research at the University of Sheffield suggests this may still be a contentious issue.

Archaeologists have described the makers of Peterborough ware as the Peterborough culture, but the term has fallen out of favour as further discoveries have cast doubt on the idea that a single unified society produced these artefacts.
