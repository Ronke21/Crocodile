==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, she first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #4 (September 1963).

==Fictional character biography==

Betty Brant was born in Philadelphia. Her mother had originally been the &quot;Girl Friday&quot; of &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; editor J. Jonah Jameson, and Betty dropped out of high school to become Jameson&#x27;s secretary at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; after her mother suffered serious injury. As Peter Parker&#x27;s first love, she met him when he became a freelance photographer for the &quot;Bugle&quot;. After they had been attacked by the Vulture, Peter had already noticed his attraction to Betty, and was impressed when she stood up to Jameson over publishing slandering articles against Spider-Man. They began dating shortly afterwards, when Betty was impressed by Parker&#x27;s kindness when taking care of his ill Aunt May.

Her secretarial job at the &quot;Bugle&quot; was taken to help her brother Bennett Brant pay back his gambling debts, which he had acquired trying to pay for their mother&#x27;s medical bills. Bennett had become friendly with Betty&#x27;s then boyfriend Gordon Savinski. Gordon was into many illegal activities and Bennett eventually took on a gambling debt that he could not pay back to a gangster named Blackie Gaxton. When Blackie&#x27;s thugs came looking for Bennett at the family home, Betty&#x27;s mother was knocked into a coffee table, resulting in permanent brain damage.

With the help of Doctor Octopus, Blackie Gaxton kidnapped both Bennett and Betty as insurance against anyone preventing him leaving the country. Bennett was double crossed when Glaxton refused to free him of his debts and was fatally shot during a melee between Glaxton&#x27;s gang, Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man. At first, Betty blamed Spider-Man for the death of her brother and told Spider-Man that she never wanted to see him again, although afterwards she realized she had been wrong and that he had only been trying to help. The blossoming romance between Betty and Peter was cut short, when Betty feared that Peter cared more for his classmate Liz Allan. This misunderstanding led to their relationship finally coming to an end.

===Ned Leeds===
Soon after Peter and Betty&#x27;s break up, she started dating fellow &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; employee reporter Ned Leeds. Even though he soon left for Europe, they remained in contact, writing each other letters regularly. Upon his return, they began dating again, and Leeds eventually proposed to Betty. There were signs that Betty still loved Peter, and Peter did his best to alienate her for her own good. She eventually accepted Leeds&#x27; marriage proposal.

After their engagement, J. Jonah Jameson threw an engagement party at his penthouse apartment and their wedding soon followed. Their wedding day was not all smooth sailing as a costumed criminal named Mirage decided to rob all the guests at the top weddings on that day. Spider-Man intervened and Mirage was easily captured. Betty and Ned were married with Mary Jane Watson serving as Betty&#x27;s maid of honor.

Soon after their wedding, Jameson sent both Betty and Ned off to Paris on an all expenses paid working honeymoon. Betty began to notice a change in Ned as he became consumed by work. While Ned covered an insurrection in Cyprus she flew back to New York to the consoling arms of Peter. After discovering Betty&#x27;s disappearance Ned returned to New York and confronted both Peter and Betty. Ned punched Peter in the jaw and tried to force him to never see Betty again. Peter said he never wanted to see either of them again and that he was only interested in Betty to make Mary Jane jealous, in the hope that this would bring Ned and Betty back together. Advice that Peter had received from a ghostly Noah King dressed as a priest.

After that, the villain Sin-Eater marks Betty for death, but she escapes his murder attempt.

Ned&#x27;s investigative reporting brought an incredible strain on the Leeds&#x27; marriage. Following leads on the mysterious new villain named Hobgoblin, Leeds was captured and hypnotized to think that he was the Hobgoblin. During this period Betty turned to her friend Flash Thompson, but he too was framed by the real Hobgoblin and in the process Betty saw Ned dressed as the Hobgoblin threatening Flash. Her mind, already fragile, was pushed over the edge. Meanwhile, a mercenary named Jason Macendale asked the Foreigner for information on who the Hobgoblin was and was given Leeds&#x27; name. When Ned followed an espionage story to Berlin, under hypnosis he dressed himself as the Hobgoblin and was assassinated by the Foreigner&#x27;s men. Macendale after thinking the original Hobgoblin was dead, would later adopt the identity of the Hobgoblin for himself.

Betty suffered a complete mental breakdown after the news of Ned&#x27;s death by the Foreigner, and believed him to still be alive. In her state a young recruiter from the Cult of Love was able to persuade her to join their faction under a leader called the Teacher where she was programmed in their ways. The Teacher turned out to be a con artist. Flash and Spider-Man figured this out and saved Betty, though she lost everything she owned and had to take up residence with Flash Thompson. During this, the demonic events of &quot;Inferno&quot; happened, overwhelming much of New York City. Betty and Flash were attacked by demonic duplicates of Spider-Man and Ned. Betty overcame physical and psychological barriers and succeeded in destroying the monsters.

After these difficult times, she returned to work at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; as a secretary under the city editor Kate Cushing. A change in Betty occurred when she became an investigative reporter who successfully tracked down the Foreigner and his assassins and found out the real identity of the Hobgoblin which finally put her mind at rest. She has now become one of the top investigative reporters at the &quot;Bugle&quot;.

===Deadline===
In &quot;Deadline&quot;, during her time at the &quot;Bugle&quot;, she became friends with Kat Farrell and pushed her to take on the Judge Hart case in order to get a better job at the &quot;Bugle&quot;. She kept a spare key to Kat&#x27;s apartment in her desk, which fellow reporter Paul Swanson used to break into Kat&#x27;s apartment in an attempt to scare her off the case.

===Brand New Day===
In Brand New Day&#x27;s storyline, Betty became a reporter under Dexter Bennett after Jameson&#x27;s heart attack forced his wife to sell the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; to him, and she became the only one of the old circle to remain working at the &quot;Bugle&quot;. As Dexter was trying to sidestep Betty and make her his &quot;Girl Friday&quot; again, Peter drops hints of a fake family relationship between Betty and the deceased actor Marlon Brando, bolstering her position in Bennett&#x27;s eye as a gossip reporter.

Recently, she celebrated her birthday and asked Peter to organize for her friends to come over for a dinner, but due to her work at the new &quot;DB&quot;, nobody feels like befriending her. In fact, only Peter showed up at her birthday, because he was the only one of her friends that was not angry with her. Initially, Betty was furious at Peter, angrily accusing him of ruining her night until he tells her the truth. She is sad, but he reassures her that everyone will forgive her soon. Betty realizes that Peter really is her best friend.

Following the &quot;DB&quot;&#x27;s destruction, she went on to create a successful journalism blog; she is last seen with having gotten back together with Flash.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Betty Brant is again the loyal secretary of J. Jonah Jameson at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. She is a headstrong woman, trying to get by in life and having as much fun on dates as she can get. This version has a considerably different personality as she goes as far as making bets about the deaths of missing co-workers. She also lacks her mainstream counterpart&#x27;s brown bob hairstyle and instead sporting long black hair (but her design was not concrete at the beginning of the series). She worked herself up into a rage while trying to build the &quot;Bugle&quot; website to which Peter Parker took over from her and got his job at the &quot;Bugle&quot; as a webdesigner.

Jameson rejects her request to find out more about the disappearance of Nick Fury, alleging that a brief affair with Kraven the Hunter before his arrest proves that she is incapable of any reporting assignment beyond covering college fashion shows. Sometime after the original Spider-Man&#x27;s death, Betty later gets the footage of the new Spider-Man stopping some muggers and presents this to Jameson. The story of a new Spider-Man makes the headlines. Betty is subsequently killed by Venom after trying to expose the new Spider-Man&#x27;s identity.

===What If?===

In &quot;What If the Radioactive Spider Had Bitten Someone Else?&quot;, Betty is one of three candidates – along with Flash Thompson and John Jameson – who is bitten by the radioactive spider which gave Spider-Man his powers. After confiding in Peter, and with his assistance, she begins to fight crime under the name &quot;The Amazing Spider-Girl&quot;, with a mask similar to Spider-Man&#x27;s but a very different costume. One time, she fails to stop a certain crook, who subsequently murders Peter&#x27;s uncle Ben. The shock over the consequences of her failure makes Betty quit her Spider-Girl identity, although Peter takes up the identity of Spider-Man later on by synthetically recreating and ingesting the irradiated spider&#x27;s venom. This incarnation also appears in the Spider-Verse.

===Marvel Noir===
In the Marvel Noir universe, Betty Brant is once again depicted as the personal secretary of J. Jonah Jameson at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;.

===&quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;===

In the alternate reality where Gwen Stacy is Spider-Gwen, a.k.a. Spider-Woman, Brant is the bass player for the high school rock band the Mary Janes. Out of the four musicians (Mary Jane, Glory Grant, and Gwen Stacy), she is shown to have a larger interest in death metal and darker subjects such as horror. She has a cat named Murderface.

<text>Ralph de Warneville (died 1191; sometimes Ralph de Varneville or Ralf of Wanneville) was the twentieth Lord Chancellor of England as well as later Bishop of Lisieux in Normandy.

Ralph was probably from Varneville aux Grès in Normandy, from which he derived his name.

Ralph became Treasurer of Rouen sometime between 11 July 1146, the last appearance of his predecessor in office, and 27 September 1146 when Ralph is named as treasurer for the first time. He held the office of treasurer until 1176. He acquired the office of Archdeacon of Rouen in 1170, holding the office along with the treasurership of Rouen for a few years. After he left the treasurership, Ralph was accused by the cathedral chapter of Rouen of misusing some of the funds of the cathedral, and the dispute dragged on until 1188, when it was heard by a papal commission.

Ralph also held offices in England. He was Treasurer of York from 1167 until 1181, and was Archdeacon of the East Riding at about the same time. Ralph served King Henry II of England as Lord Chancellor from 1173 to 1181.

Ralph was a friend of Arnulf of Lisieux, Bishop of Lisieux, and benefited from Arnulf&#x27;s intercession with the Bishop of Poitiers. But during Ralph&#x27;s chancellorship, Ralph was one of the royal officials that urged Arnulf to resign his bishopric. Arnulf was suspected by King Henry of supporting Henry&#x27;s sons in their Revolt of 1173–74, and eventually Arnulf was forced to resign his see. Ralph also had custody of the castle and royal lands at Vaudreuil in Normandy in the 1180s, and was still owing accounts for his administration at his death.

Ralph was appointed Bishop of Lisieux in July 1181, after his resignation from the office of Chancellor. He was not consecrated until after 1182, as he was still being recorded as bishop-elect then.

Ralph died on 10 September 1191, as his death was commemorated on 10 September at St Evroul.

<text>Purple Onion is the debut studio album by The Les Claypool Frog Brigade, released on September 24, 2002. It followed two live releases by the band, and is the first release of the Frog Brigade&#x27;s original compositions. While the Brigade regulars are consistent on much of the record such as Jay Lane, Eenor Wildeboar, Skerik and new percussionist Mike &quot;Tree Frog&quot; Dillon, many special guests appear on the album as well. Guests on multiple tracks include Ben Barnes and Sam Bass (then both from Deadweight). &quot;D&#x27;s Diner,&quot; a tribute to a Sebastopol, California restaurant, features sitar player Gabby La La in addition to the triple-bass onslaught of Claypool, Norwood Fisher (Fishbone) and Lonnie Marshall (Weapon of Choice). Warren Haynes (Allman Brothers Band) adds slide guitar on the &quot;Buzzards of Green Hill&quot; and Fish Fisher (Fishbone drummer) guests on &quot;Whamola.&quot; &quot;Whamola&quot; was a live show staple named after the unique instrument Les employs—a one-string bass played with a drumstick. The song later appeared as a remix for the theme of &quot;South Park Season 10&quot;. &quot;Barrington Hall&quot; is a tribute to the UC Berkeley student housing known in the 1960s-1980s for counterculture.
&quot;Purple Onion&quot; was released on vinyl for the first time on November 24, 2009.

==Reception==
Reception for &quot;Purple Onion&quot; was positive. The &quot;College Music Journal&quot; (&quot;CMJ&quot;) wrote that &quot;Claypool&#x27;s bass-spanking and carnival barker delivery warp the songs like the inside of a funhouse mirror.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a rating of three out of five, and stated that the album &quot;Allows the master bass player to give full vent to his weirdness. ... Sure to please hardcore fans.&quot; The &quot;AllMusic&quot; review by Jesse Jarnow awarded the album three stars out of five, and wrote that &quot;The music isn&#x27;t nearly as edgy or angular as his work with Primus, but that&#x27;s ultimately okay.&quot;

Tom Waits listed it 19th among his favorite albums.

<doc id="654525" wikidata="Q2827500" url="?curid=654525" title="Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti">
<text>Aḥmad Bābā al-Timbuktī (), full name Abū al-Abbās Aḥmad ibn Aḥmad ibn Aḥmad ibn Umar ibn Muhammad Aqit al-Takrūrī Al-Massufi al-Timbuktī (1556 – 1627 CE, 963 – 1036 H), was a Sanhaja Berber writer, scholar, and political provocateur in the area then known as the Western Sudan. He was a prolific author and wrote more than 40 books.

==Life==
Aḥmad Bābā was born on October 26, 1556, in Araouane to the Sanhaja Berber Aqit family. He moved to Timbuktu at an early age where he studied with his father, Aḥmad ibn al-Ḥājj Aḥmad ibn ‘Umar ibn Muḥammad Aqīt, and the scholar Mohammed Bagayogo (var. Baghayu&#x27;u); there are no other records of his activity until 1594, when he was deported to Morocco over accusations of sedition, after the Moroccan invasion of Songhai where he remained in Fez until the death of Ahmad al-Mansur. His successor, Zaydan An-Nasser, allowed all exiles to return to their country. Aḥmad Bābā reached Timbuktu on April 22, 1608.

==Legacy==
A fair amount of the work he was noted for was written while he was in Morocco, including the biography of Muhammad Abd al-Karim al-Maghili, a scholar and jurist responsible for much of the traditional religious law of the area. A biographical note was translated by M.A. Cherbonneau in 1855, and became one of the principal texts for study of the legal history of the Western Sudan. Ahmad Baba&#x27;s surviving works remain the best sources for the study of al-Maghili and the generation that succeeded him. Ahmad Baba was considered the Mujjadid (reviver of religion) of the century.

The only public library in Timbuktu, the Ahmed Baba Institute (which stores over 18,000 manuscripts) is named in his honor.

In 1615 Ahmad discussed along with other Muslim scholars on the question of slavery, in order to protect Muslims from being enslaved. He is known to have provided one of the first ideas of ethnicity within West Africa.

==Stance on Race==
Ahmad Baba made an effort to end racial slavery and criticised the association of Black Africans with slaves, particularly criticising some Muslims adopting the narrative of the Curse of Ham, found in the book of Genesis.

However, Ahmad Baba was not an advocate for ending the slave trade generally. Rather, in writing the Mi&#x27;raj al Su&#x27;ud ila nayl hukm mujallab al-Sud, he sought only to reform the Trans-Saharan Slave Trade with the goal of preventing Muslims from enslaving other Muslims.

According to William Phillips, al-Timbukti essentially advocated religion-based slavery instead of racial-slavery, with Muslims of any ethnicity being immune from being enslaved.

== Stance on Slavery ==
In regards to the enslavement of Africans in 1615, Ahmad Bābā discussed the legitimate reasons of how and why one could become a slave. The driving force, mainly being religious and ethnic, were that if one came from a country with a Muslim government, or identified with specific Muslim ethnic groups, then they could not be slaves. He claimed that if a person was an unbeliever or a kafara, then that is the sole factor for their enslavement, along with that being “the will of God.”

In the piece &quot;Ahmad Bābā and the Ethics of Slavery&quot;, he claims that his beliefs fueled the thought that those who identified as Muslim no longer had to be enslaved, but anyone that was an outsider (or nonbeliever) would then be enslaved by Muslims. These were not simply beliefs these were the rules that are given by God Most High, who knows best. Even in the case that the people of the country were believers but their belief was shallow then those people could still be enslaved with no questions asked. According to Ahmad Bābā, it was known that the people of Kumbe were shallow in their beliefs. He goes on to use the analogy that when one country is conquered and contains nonbelievers, then those persons could be enslaved as part of his stance on any other outsider or religion besides Islam.

This is a different kind of thinking in comparison to the works of William D. Phillips Jr., who wrote &quot;The Middle Ages Series: Slavery in Medieval and Early Modern Iberia&quot;. In his piece, the main factor that distinguished a slave from an ordinary person would be their religious differences. This ties into Ahmad Bābā&#x27;s ideas about enslavement involving everyone except those who practiced Islam. More specifically to his ideas on slavery, Phillips discussed how Christians enslaved Muslims, and Muslims enslaved Christians. However, Ahmad Bābā&#x27;s hope was to end the enslaving of Muslims entirely and instead have other religious groups be enslaved, as they were considered to be unbelievers of the Muslim faith.

Another contradicting idea, discussed in the article &quot;Slavery in Africa&quot; by Suzanne Meirs and Igor Kopytoff, was that enslavement was based on people who are forced out of their homeland into a completely foreign area, tying into Ahmad&#x27;s beliefs. Meirs and Kopytoff discuss the possibility of being accepted into a community through means of earning their freedom, being granted freedom by their owner, or being born into freedom. But in Ahmad Bābā&#x27;s perspective, if one converted to Islam and were once an “unbeliever” before being enslaved, then that individual would still hold that title of being a slave. An unbeliever was classified as anyone who was Christian, Jewish, etc. however Ahmad Bābā states that there are no differences between unbelievers regardless of their different religious beliefs of Christianity, Persian, Jews, etc.

<text>Elan Corporation plc was a major drugs firm based in Dublin, Ireland, which had major interests in the United States. It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange as ELN, the Irish Stock Exchange as ELN.I, and the London Stock Exchange as ELN.L. In 2013, the company merged with Perrigo to form Perrigo Company PLC.

==History==
The company was founded in Ireland by American businessman Don Panoz in 1969. In the late 1990s, its value on the Irish Stock Exchange reached over €20bn. However, in 2002, an accounting scandal and investor reactions to the global slump, caused a major devaluation resulting in a share price slump of over 90%. In July 2010, Élan was fined $203m for its marketing of epilepsy drugs.

In February 2013, Elan decided to dispose of the rights to sell Tysabri to Biogen Idec for $3.25 billion.

==Products in development==
In neurology, Elan was focused on building upon its research and experience in the area of neuropathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease, where the company’s efforts included programs focused on small molecule inhibitors of beta secretase and gamma secretase, enzymes whose actions are thought to affect the accumulation of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. An example of such a molecule is semagacestat. Elan also studied other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Élan, in collaboration with Wyeth, conducted a Phase III clinical trial for bapineuzumab, an experimental humanized monoclonal antibody with a targeted indication of immunotherapeutic treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. This humanized monoclonal antibody is designed and engineered to clear the neurotoxic beta-amyloid peptide, that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Although initial results from an earlier Phase II clinical trial presented in July 2008 were inconclusive, Elan is hopeful that bapineuzumab will prove successful in the treatment of this disease.

In autoimmune diseases, Elan’s primary emphasis was studying cell trafficking to discover ways to provide disease-modifying therapies for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Research efforts were also focused on physiological and neuropathic pain. Previously named Antegren, natalizumab is a drug co-marketed by Biogen Idec and Élan as &quot;Tysabri&quot;. Tysabri is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits immune cells from crossing blood vessel walls to reach various tissues, including the brain. It has proven efficacy in the treatment of two serious autoimmune disorders: multiple sclerosis, and Crohn&#x27;s disease.

<text>Legends of the Fall is a 1994 American epic historical Western drama film directed by Edward Zwick, and starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn, Julia Ormond and Henry Thomas. Based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison, the film is about three brothers and their father living in the wilderness and plains of Montana in the early 20th century and how their lives are affected by nature, history, war, and love. The film&#x27;s timeframe spans nearly 50 years from the early 20th century; World War I, through the Prohibition era, and ending with a brief scene set in 1963. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards and won for Best Cinematography (John Toll). Both the film and book contain occasional Cornish language terms, the Ludlows being a Cornish immigrant family.

==Plot==
Sick of betrayals the US government perpetrated on Native Americans, Colonel William Ludlow leaves the Army, moving to a remote part of Montana. Along with One Stab, a Cree friend, he builds a ranch and raises his family. Accompanying them are hired hand and former outlaw Decker with his Cree wife Pet, and daughter Isabel Two. William has three sons: Alfred, the eldest; Tristan, the middle son; and Samuel, the youngest.

William&#x27;s wife Isabel does not adapt to the harsh Montana winters and moves to the East Coast; Tristan vows never to speak of her. At age 12, Tristan touches a sleeping grizzly bear, which awakens and injures him, but he cuts off a claw.

Years later in 1913, Samuel returns from Harvard University with his fiancée, Susannah. Before they can marry, he announces his intention to join the Canadian Expeditionary Force and aid Britain in the fight against Germany in World War I. Much to William&#x27;s displeasure, Alfred also joins. Tristan reluctantly joins after swearing to Susannah to protect Samuel.

The brothers find themselves in the 10th Battalion, CEF. Alfred, commissioned as an officer, leads a charge into no man&#x27;s land. The attack results in heavy casualties and he is wounded. While visiting Alfred in the field hospital, Tristan learns that Samuel volunteered for a dangerous reconnaissance mission. He rushes off to protect his brother but arrives too late. Tristan holds Samuel until he dies, then cuts out his brother&#x27;s heart and sends it home to be buried at the ranch.

Maddened with grief, Tristan single-handedly raids the German lines and returns to camp with the scalps of German soldiers hanging around his neck, horrifying his fellow soldiers. He is discharged but does not go home. Alfred returns to Montana and proposes to Susannah, but she declines.

Tristan returns home, where Susannah finds him weeping over Samuel&#x27;s grave. She comforts him and they become lovers. A jealous Alfred confronts Tristan before leaving to make his name in Helena. Tristan is plagued with guilt over Samuel&#x27;s death and feels responsible for driving Alfred away; he leaves Montana for several years.

Susannah vows to wait for Tristan but eventually receives a letter from him telling her to marry someone else. Alfred comforts her, and when William finds them together, it leads to a falling out between father and son. William later suffers a stroke, does not speak for years and the ranch deteriorates. Susannah marries Alfred, now a congressman. Alfred&#x27;s business and politics cause him to get involved with the O&#x27;Banion brothers, Irish bootleggers and gangsters.

Tristan returns in 1920 during Prohibition, bringing life back to the ranch and to his father. He falls in love with Isabel Two and they marry and have two children. Tristan becomes involved in small-scale rum-running, finding himself at odds with the O&#x27;Banions. Isabel Two is accidentally killed by a corrupt police officer working for the gangsters. Furious, Tristan beats the officer nearly to death and is jailed.

Susannah visits Tristan, still having feelings for him, but he refuses her advances. After his release, he and Decker kill those responsible for Isabel&#x27;s death, including one of the O&#x27;Banion brothers.

Unable to live without Tristan, Susannah commits suicide. The remaining O&#x27;Banion brother, along with the sheriff and another officer, come after Tristan in revenge. At the ranch, William and Alfred kill the attackers. Alfred reconciles with his father and brother.

The family realizes that Tristan will be blamed for the deaths and hunted relentlessly by the O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s allies, prompting him to ask Alfred to take care of his children. They then bury the bodies and dump the car in the Missouri River. Tristan lives to watch his children and grandchildren grow.

In 1963, Tristan, now an old man living in the North Country after having killed off the last of his enemies, investigates an animal carcass and is confronted by a grizzly bear. He draws his knife, fights it and dies in the struggle.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Filming===
&quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; was primarily filmed on location in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. Principal photography began in mid-July 1993. The World War I battlefield scenes took two weeks to film and were shot near Morley, Alberta, with hundreds of locals and a few Canadian Forces soldiers recruited as extras. The Ghost River Wilderness Area in Alberta served as the filming location for the Ludlow ranch; additional outdoor scenes, as well as the funeral and cemetery scenes, were shot at the Bow River near Banff National Park. A historic harbour area in Vancouver called Gastown was augmented with period building facades for the Helena, Montana, street scenes. Hotel scenes were shot at the Hotel Europe at 43 Powell Street in Vancouver. Additional scenes were shot at Maple Tree Square in Gastown, Vancouver, and Ocho Rios in Saint Ann, Jamaica. Filming wrapped up around January 1994.

in 2024, Zwick released his memoir, &quot;Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions: My Fortysomething Years in Hollywood&quot;, in which he talked about his difficult experiences working with Brad Pitt, whom he described as volatile. Zwick claimed that they clashed over their visions for the film, and that Pitt was upset about the final cut.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film opened in limited release on December 23, 1994, and expanded to a wide release on January 13, 1995. During its first weekend in wide release, a four-day weekend due to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the film reached number one at the domestic box office after grossing $14 million. After its initial run, the film brought in a final box office total of $160,638,883. Against its $30 million budget, the film was a financial success.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 61% of 61 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Featuring a swoon-worthy star turn by Brad Pitt, &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;″s painterly photography and epic sweep often compensate for its lack of narrative momentum and glut of melodramatic twists.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 45 based on 23 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described the film as &quot;pretty good ... with full-blooded performances and heartfelt melodrama&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; particularly praised Pitt&#x27;s performance saying, &quot;Though the admirable Quinn has the toughest role, Pitt carries the picture. The blue-eyed boy who seemed a bit lost in &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; proves himself a bona fide movie star, stealing every scene he&#x27;s in.&quot; Comparatively, Chris Hicks of &quot;Deseret News&quot; noted, &quot;Pitt is the hunk of the moment, and &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; will only further cement his big-screen, romantic leading-man status. And he is satisfying as the internalized, rebellious Tristan (look for that name to be given to more than a few babies over the next few years). Even if the character seems only a slight twist on the similar role he played in &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;. (He even becomes a bootlegger!)&quot; Multiple critics compared the plot of the Ludlow brothers to films like &quot;East of Eden&quot; and &quot;Giant.&quot;

On the other hand, Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that the film&#x27;s &quot;yarn doesn&#x27;t so much sweep as sprawl across the screen in all its panoramic idiocy&quot;. While some critics praised the film&#x27;s performances and cinematography, they also felt the plot takes on much more than it can handle and might be better suited for a miniseries. John Hartl of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The actors fit their roles exceptionally well, but Zwick rarely allows them the kinds of crucial, intimate moments that establish how the characters feel about each other. Occasionally the story grips, suggesting what might have been if the actors had been playing people instead of archetypes.&quot; The film&#x27;s script and its propensity for melodrama was also critiqued, with some saying the story reaches soap opera-like heights and leaves its characters underdeveloped. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;As densely plotted as &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; is, it’s to the credit of the performers and craftsmen that the film escapes the abyss of melodrama and sentimentality. Zwick imbues the story with an easy, poetic quality that mostly sidesteps the precious. The actors, working as an ensemble, are near perfect in the service of the material.&quot; In contrast, Terrence Rafferty of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the film as a &quot;father-and-sons saga&quot; that &quot;gets sillier as it goes&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;Before it turns exhaustingly hollow, this film shows the potential for bringing Mr. Harrison&#x27;s tough, brooding tale to life. And the actors may have captured the spirit of the story, but that&#x27;s impossible to know.&quot; She concluded, &quot;These are performances that lost too much in the editing room, smothered by music and overshadowed by a picture-postcard vision of the American West.&quot; In &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, Stephen Hunter wrote, &quot;What &#x27;Legends of the Fall&#x27; lacks is any spirit of rigor. It buys into -- indeed, is selling -- the oldest of guff: the idea that the violence of banal men is beautiful and righteous. It honors male anger...[it] worships the red shift of men gone nuts on vengeance. It romanticizes gunplay. It&#x27;s a big movie that&#x27;s so small on the inside it&#x27;s not there.&quot;

Elán reveals an assortment of music that has been influenced by many artists like Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, John Lennon, Melissa Etheridge, and a few other notable influences. Elán had a notable success with albums like &quot;Street Child&quot; and &quot;London Express&quot;. she has released six albums - five in English and one in Spanish. In 2017, she switched to Shy Porter as professional name, and began releasing music as such.

==Career==

===Early days===

Elán was born on 1 March 1983 in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco. Her love for music was noticed by her mother at a very young age. &quot;One day, she just climbed up on the bench and started to play; that was the moment where it all began. She was three...&quot; recalls her mother. At age 4, she began writing her first songs and her father starts to record her songs in their makeshift-home studio. &quot;She was always very determined in her writing even at such young age.&quot; Jan Carlo recalls. At age 10, she starts to perform at private parties and theatres. She started recordings with a major record label, Warner Music Group in Mexico.

===The Arista years through the recording of &quot;Street Child&quot; (2000–2003)===
BMG International, Vice President of A&amp;R, Richard Sweret flew Elán and Jan Carlo to meet Arista Records President &amp; CEO Antonio L.A. Reid. After a private showcase in which Elán played &quot;Perfect Life&quot;, Reid stated that the song was &quot;the story of my life&quot; and offered her a record deal. Jan Carlo hired former Aerosmith manager Wendy Leister to manage Elán. Her second A&amp;R representative at Arista Records, Pete Ganbarg, leaves the company, again leaving her without representation. Josh Sarubin comes in as Elán&#x27;s third A&amp;R at Arista. He suggests that Elán find another producer &quot;to work with other than her brother&quot;. She met with producers in Los Angeles, New York and Virginia.

Elán recorded with producer Mark Howard, at his studio in Los Angeles. Drummer Jim Keltner played the drums in those sessions. She later recorded with Olle Romo, at his studio in Los Angeles, the flew to New York City and records with singer/songwriter and producer Fionn O&#x27;Lochlainn. Elán and her brother traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to begin recording what was going to be the album &quot;Street Child&quot;. Recording was interrupted by the events of September 11.

On that day, she was recording a song named &quot;Crash&quot;. The sessions never concluded. Eventually, Elán left Arista Records. Soon after, Elán parted ways with Laister. Elán and Jan Carlo head back home and begin to salvage an album from the numerous sessions they have recorded in different parts of the world. They re-track most of the album and are eventually joined by Elán&#x27;s long time engineer Jeff Poe. They mix the album over the next nine months. Originally slated to be titled &quot;Some Kind Of Daydream&quot;, &quot;Street Child&quot; finally came to life.

Velvet Revolver and ex-Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash hears the song Street Child from a mutual friend and makes known his desire to participate on the title track of Elán&#x27;s album. The session was recorded at Capitol Records Studios in Los Angeles in August 2002. While at the studio, they also shot parts of the &quot;Street Child&quot; video. Three years after arriving to the U.S.A. Elán&#x27;s album is finally finished and mastered at Capitol Records by Mark Chalecki. Besides Slash, &quot;Street Child&quot; featured guest appearances by Grammy Award Winner and Beck producer Brian Paulson, David Immerglück of Counting Crows, composer/arranger Eugenio Toussaint, Alan Weatherhead of Sparklehorse and mixed by Grammy Award Winning engineer Jeff Poe.

===&quot;Street Child&quot; (2003–2004)===
On June 13, 2003, Elán&#x27;s first single &quot;Midnight&quot; is released in Mexico on their own label, Silverlight Records (licensed through Sony Music Mexico) to an unprecedented response. Her single from her album reaches #1 in airplay in some Mexican territories. &quot;Midnight&quot; climbed the &quot;Pepsi Chart&quot; to #12. On MTV Latin America, Elán&#x27;s video goes to the Top 10 Most Wanted and goes Top 10 on the Top 20 Countdown. It was a surprise hit in Australia. It became the second most added song in its first week (second only to Eminem). The song reached number 28 on the ARIA charts. &quot;Midnight&quot; went top ten across the boards (all radio formats) in airplay in the country.

===&quot;London Express&quot; (2005–2006)===
The band took a break before returning to the studio to record their second album. The band takes a year to record the follow-up to the &quot;Street Child&quot; album. The line-up consists of drummer Michel Bitar, rhythm guitarist Jonathan Fraulin and Jan Carlo on guitar. She played piano and keyboards on the record. Titled &quot;London Express&quot;, the album contains thirteen new tracks. London Express finds its roots in the music of The Beatles, which Elán has described as &quot;the only band that really changed everything&quot;.

&quot;Be Free&quot; was the first single from the &quot;London Express&quot; album. The video for the &quot;Be Free&quot; single was directed by renowned director, animator and painter Chris Roth and was in high rotation in Latin America&#x27;s largest Music Video Networks. The single itself did very well in Latin American radio stations, being at the top of the radio charts for several months.

&quot;This Fool&#x27;s Life&quot; was the second single released from Elán&#x27;s latest album &quot;London Express&quot;. &quot;This Fool&#x27;s Life&quot; was for several months the single in English with the highest rotation on the radio in many Latin American countries. Being one of the most listened to songs in English in countries like Mexico. The video for &quot;This Fool&#x27;s Life&quot; was also an outstanding success. It broke several records in Music Video Networks like Telehit which is one of the largest music television networks in the world, broadcasting throughout Mexico, Central &amp; South America, Europe and the United States, with a historic record breaking 12 weeks in the #1 position on the charts.

A third single &quot;Whatever it Takes&quot; was released in November 2006.

===&quot;What Can Be Done At This Point&quot; (2007) and &quot;Shine&quot; (2008)===
On 8 May, Elán released her new album &quot;What Can Be Done At This Point&quot;. The album consists of 10 new original tracks and includes the track &quot;What Can Be Done At This Point&quot;, song that gives the name to the album and that offers a posthumous tribute to the crew of the space shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;. The track contains original audio of the transmission between the &quot;Challenger&quot; and mission control of the day of the unforgettable tragedy.

The rights to this audio clip were granted by NASA. The first single from the new album is titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Want You In&quot;. The video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Want You In&quot; jumped straight to the Top 10 charts in videos networks like &quot;Telehit&quot;. It was directed by Gulliver Parascandolo who also directed the videos for &quot;This Fool&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot;. On 10 September 2007, she was awarded an Independent Diamond Record Award for the certified sale of 1.5 million copies of her music.

The &quot;Elan Shine Tour 2008&quot; is one of the most successful and longest running tours ever featured in Mexico by an independent band. The tour in Mexico was originally programmed for 14 shows but the tour was so successful that it was extended an additional month into June.

===&quot;Lost and Found&quot; (2009)===
The band&#x27;s fifth release, &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, experimented with new ideas while reviving one of Elán&#x27;s oldest compositions, &quot;You Forget.&quot;

===&quot;Recuerdos y Tequila&quot; (2009)===
In 2009, Elán recorded her first album entirely sung in Spanish, called &#x27;Recuerdos y Tequila&#x27; (&#x27;Memories and Tequila&#x27;). All of the songs are by artists like Fito Páez and Juan Gabriel. Elán said that &quot;it was a personal necessity to sing in Spanish and offer songs that marked my life, some of them in a personal way and others like the ones of José Alfredo Jiménez, which my father used to hear&quot;. The first single is called &quot;Al Lado del Camino&quot; (&quot;At the Side of the Road&quot;), original of Páez. The video was shot in Mexico City.

<text>The Borough of Islwyn was one of five local government districts of Gwent from 1974 to 1996.

==History==
The borough was formed in 1974 as a local government district of Gwent. It covered the whole area of three former districts and part of a fourth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Abercarn Urban District
*Bedwellty Urban District - the Argoed, Blackwood, Cefn Fforest, and Pengam wards only (rest became New Tredegar community in Rhymney Valley)
*Mynyddislwyn Urban District
*Risca Urban District
All the constituent parts of Islwyn had previously been in the administrative county of Monmouthshire prior to the reforms. Gwent County Council provided county-level services to the new borough.

The district&#x27;s name (meaning &quot;below the grove&quot;) was derived from the ancient parish of Mynyddislwyn which covered its area. This was shown in the borough&#x27;s coat of arms which represented a mountain below a grove of oak trees. Islwyn was also the pen name of local poet William Thomas (1832–1878). 

The borough was abolished in 1996, when its area became part of Caerphilly County Borough.

Islwyn continues as a Westminster constituency and a Senedd constituency. The Westminster constituency&#x27;s best-known MP was Neil Kinnock.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 1996 was held by the following parties:

==Premises==

The council built itself a new headquarters in 1977 at Pontllanfraith House on Blackwood Road in Pontllanfraith. The building subsequently served as offices for Caerphilly County Borough Council until 2015 and has since been demolished.

<text>José Martiniano de Alencar (May 1, 1829 – December 12, 1877) was a Brazilian lawyer, politician, orator, novelist and dramatist. He is considered to be one of the most famous and influential Brazilian Romantic novelists of the 19th century, and a major exponent of the literary tradition known as &quot;Indianism&quot;. Sometimes he signed his works with the pen name Erasmo. He was patron of the 23rd chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.

==Biography==
José Martiniano de Alencar was born in Messejana, Fortaleza, Ceará, on May 1, 1829, to politician José Martiniano Pereira de Alencar and his cousin Ana Josefina de Alencar. His family was a rich and influential clan in Northeastern Brazil, his grandmother being famous landowner Barbara Pereira de Alencar, heroine of the Pernambucan Revolution. Moving to São Paulo in 1844, he graduated in Law at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo in 1850 and started his career in law in Rio de Janeiro. Invited by his friend Francisco Otaviano, he became a collaborator for the journal &quot;Correio Mercantil&quot;. He also wrote many chronicles for the &quot;Diário do Rio de Janeiro&quot; and the &quot;Jornal do Commercio&quot;. Alencar would compile all the chronicles he wrote for these newspapers in 1874, under the name &quot;Ao Correr da Pena&quot;.

It was in the &quot;Diário do Rio de Janeiro&quot;, during the year of 1856, that Alencar gained notoriety, writing the &quot;Cartas sobre A Confederação dos Tamoios&quot;, under the pseudonym Ig. In them, he bitterly criticized the homonymous poem by Gonçalves de Magalhães. Even the Brazilian Emperor Pedro II, who esteemed Magalhães very much, participated in this polemic, albeit under a pseudonym. Also in 1856, he wrote and published under &quot;feuilleton&quot; form his first romance, &quot;Cinco Minutos&quot;, that received critical acclaim. In the following year, his breakthrough novel, &quot;O Guarani&quot;, was released; it would be adapted into a famous opera by Brazilian composer Antônio Carlos Gomes 13 years later. &quot;O Guarani&quot; would be first novel of what is informally called Alencar&#x27;s &quot;Indianist Trilogy&quot; – a series of three novels by Alencar that focused on the foundations of the Brazilian nation, and on its indigenous peoples and culture. The other two novels, &quot;Iracema&quot; and &quot;Ubirajara&quot;, would be published on 1865 and 1874, respectively. Although called a trilogy, the three books are unrelated in their plots.

Alencar was affiliated with the Conservative Party of Brazil, being elected as a general deputy for Ceará. He was the Brazilian Minister of Justice from 1868 to 1870, having famously opposed the abolition of slavery. He also planned to be a senator, but Pedro II never appointed him, under the pretext of Alencar being too young; with his feelings hurt, he would abandon politics later.

He was very close friends with the also famous writer Machado de Assis, who wrote an article in 1866 praising his novel &quot;Iracema&quot;, that was published the year before, comparing his Indianist works to Gonçalves Dias, saying that &quot;Alencar was in prose what Dias was in poetry&quot;. When Assis founded the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1897, he chose Alencar as the patron of his chair.

In 1864 he married Georgina Augusta Cochrane, daughter of an eccentric British aristocrat. They would have six children – Augusto (who would be the Brazilian Minister of External Relations in 1919, and also the Brazilian ambassador in the United States from 1920 to 1924), Clarisse, Ceci, Elisa, Mário (who would be a journalist and writer, and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters) and Adélia. (It is implied that Mário de Alencar was actually an illegitimate son of Machado de Assis, a fact that inspired Assis to write his famous novel &quot;Dom Casmurro&quot;.)

Alencar died in Rio de Janeiro in 1877, a victim of tuberculosis. A theatre in Fortaleza, the Theatro José de Alencar, was named after him. His works were marked by the influence of his Roman Catholic faith.

<text>Geoffrey ( – 12 December 1212) was an illegitimate son of King Henry II of England who became bishop-elect of Lincoln and archbishop of York. The identity of his mother is uncertain, but she may have been named Ykenai. Geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173, though he was not ordained as a priest until 1189. In 1173–1174, he led a campaign in northern England to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half-brothers; this campaign led to the capture of William, King of Scots. By 1182, Pope Lucius III had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be consecrated as bishop; he chose to resign and became chancellor instead. He was the only one of Henry II&#x27;s sons present at the king&#x27;s death.

Geoffrey&#x27;s half-brother Richard I nominated him archbishop of York after succeeding to the throne of England, probably to force him to become a priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. After some dispute, Geoffrey was consecrated archbishop in 1191. He soon became embroiled in a conflict with William Longchamp, Richard&#x27;s regent in England, after being detained at Dover on his return to England following his consecration in France. Geoffrey claimed sanctuary in the town, but he was seized by agents of Longchamp and briefly imprisoned in Dover Castle. Subsequently, a council of magnates ordered Longchamp out of office, and Geoffrey was able to proceed to his archdiocese. The archbishop spent much of his archiepiscopate in various disputes with his half-brothers: first Richard and then John, who succeeded to the English throne in 1199. Geoffrey also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops, his cathedral chapter, and other clergy in his diocese. His last quarrel with John was in 1207, when the archbishop refused to allow the collection of a tax and was driven into exile in France. He died there five years later.

==Early life==

Geoffrey was probably born in about 1152, before his father Henry, later Henry II of England, married Eleanor of Aquitaine, and was likely named after his paternal grandfather, Geoffrey of Anjou. Although he is often given the surname &quot;Plantagenet&quot; in modern histories, that name was not in use during his lifetime. The date of his birth is determined by statements of Gerald of Wales that he was barely 20 when elected bishop in 1173, and by the fact that he was about 40 when consecrated archbishop in 1191. His mother&#x27;s identity is unclear. The medieval chronicler Walter Map claimed she was a whore named Ykenai, and that he was not actually Henry&#x27;s son. This is the only contemporary source that gives her name, and as Map was hostile to Geoffrey, the information must be judged carefully. Instead, Ykenai may have been a daughter of a knight. Another possibility for Geoffrey&#x27;s mother is Rosamund Clifford, but most of the evidence for this is circumstantial. It is assumed that Geoffrey was the eldest of Henry&#x27;s children, legitimate or illegitimate.

Henry II had eight children from his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine, including the future kings Richard I and John of England. Geoffrey was brought up with his father&#x27;s legitimate children. There is no evidence that Henry tried to deny Geoffrey&#x27;s paternity, although Walter Map said that Henry&#x27;s acknowledgment was done &quot;improperly and with little discretion&quot;. Geoffrey had a brother named Peter, who appears to have been his maternal half-brother, as Peter is generally considered unlikely to have been Henry&#x27;s son.

Geoffrey was Archdeacon of Lincoln in the diocese of Lincoln by September 1171, and probably retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop-elect in 1175. He also held a prebend, an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter, in the diocese of London, but there is little evidence that he executed the duties of either office. There are some indications that he studied canon law at a school in Northampton, and that he taught in Paris during the early 1170s. He also acted as a papal judge-delegate at that time. Pope Alexander III initially refused to confirm Geoffrey&#x27;s selection as Bishop of Lincoln in about May 1173, prompting Geoffrey to travel to Rome in October 1174 to secure confirmation of this office. He was confirmed in the office of bishop by July 1175, but he was not ordained at that time, as he was under the canonical age for holding a bishopric. Geoffrey&#x27;s youth was one of Alexander&#x27;s objections to Geoffrey&#x27;s election, and the pope only confirmed the office under duress. Another potential problem was Geoffrey&#x27;s illegitimacy, which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office, but that was dealt with by the granting of a papal dispensation.

In 1173 and early 1174 Geoffrey fought a military campaign in northern England in support of his father&#x27;s attempts to subdue the Scots, who were supporting the rebellion by Geoffrey&#x27;s legitimate half-brothers against their father. The campaign resulted in the capture of William the Lion, the King of Scots, at the Battle of Alnwick and also helped to compel Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, to pledge fealty to Henry II. During the campaign, Geoffrey captured several castles held by Roger Mowbray, a supporter of the Scottish king. It was after this campaign that Henry said of Geoffrey &quot;My other sons are the real bastards. ... This is the only one who&#x27;s proved himself legitimate!&quot; After Geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by Pope Alexander in 1175, the bishop-elect made a ceremonial visit to Lincoln on 1 August 1175. He subsequently went to study at Tours, where he probably befriended Peter of Blois, a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on St Wilfrid to Geoffrey. The bishop-elect made several gifts to the cathedral at Lincoln, including two bells for the bell tower. While Geoffrey was the bishop-elect at Lincoln, it appears that Adam, Bishop of St Asaph, carried out the episcopal duties in the diocese of Lincoln, as Geoffrey had not been consecrated and was unable to perform those functions. Nevertheless, he managed to recover some lands of the diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items. Although he aided the finances of his diocese with these recoveries, in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father. In 1181 Pope Lucius III became concerned that Geoffrey was never going to be ordained or consecrated, and demanded that the bishop-elect&#x27;s position be regularised, either through consecration as bishop or through resignation.

==Chancellor==

Geoffrey formally resigned the see of Lincoln on 6 January 1182, at Marlborough in England, rather than be ordained as Pope Lucius III had ordered. Henry had named him Chancellor of England in 1181, after Geoffrey indicated he was going to resign the bishopric in February 1181. Although Geoffrey resigned the episcopal office, he continued to hold benefices in plurality, which was normally contrary to canon law. These offices included the Treasurer of York from 1182, the Archdeaconry of Rouen from 1183, and probably the Archdeaconry of East Riding. Henry also gave him two continental castles, one in Anjou and one in Touraine, along with lands in England and Normandy worth 1000 marks a year. Although Geoffrey held the office of Chancellor, he appears in only few documents, mainly between 1182 and 1185. After 1185 he does not appear in any contemporary documents until 1187, and it is possible that he spent some time outside his father&#x27;s domains. Peter of Blois wrote that several monarchs considered Geoffrey as a possible successor for their kingdoms in Italy or the Holy Land, and that he was actually offered the throne of Jerusalem by Heraclius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem. It is possible that Geoffrey&#x27;s non-appearance in documents was due to his absence from his father&#x27;s domains in pursuit of these ambitions. During Geoffrey&#x27;s term of office as Chancellor Walter de Coutances served as his &quot;seal-keeper&quot;; the need for someone to perform this function adds further evidence to the likelihood that Geoffrey&#x27;s time as Chancellor was spent on unrelated duties for his father. William Longchamp fulfilled the same assistant role for the archdeaconry at Rouen.

Following the declaration of war on Henry by Prince Richard and King Philip II of France in 1187, Geoffrey was given command of a quarter of the English royal army. He and his father were driven from Le Mans, Henry&#x27;s birthplace, in 1189. Geoffrey did not attend the subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry&#x27;s death, unwilling to witness his father&#x27;s humiliation, but he did help nurse him during his final days. Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or Bishop of Winchester, and Geoffrey used his father&#x27;s seal to make appointments to York after Henry&#x27;s death. Geoffrey then escorted Henry&#x27;s body to Fontevrault Abbey for burial. He was the only one of Henry II&#x27;s sons present at his death.

==Archbishop==

===First difficulties===

Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189, within days of taking the throne; the formal election took place on 10 August. What happened with the vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne, and why, as well as the exact chronology of events, is complicated by the contradictory nature of the main contemporary accounts. Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York, but another chronicler, Benedict of Peterborough relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates. However the election occurred, Geoffrey&#x27;s consecration did not take place until much later, and soon after his election, he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor. A further complication was that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, as archbishop.

Richard probably gave York to Geoffrey in the hope of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected to be out of the country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard&#x27;s efforts to keep Geoffrey&#x27;s possible ambitions towards the English throne in check. But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey&#x27;s appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid. Walter&#x27;s election to York was supported by Richard&#x27;s mother, Eleanor, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product of one of her husband&#x27;s affairs. Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at Pipewell on 16 September. At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the diocese of York: he made Henry Marshal the dean; Burchard du Puiset, a relative of Hugh du Puiset, became treasurer; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest. The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard&#x27;s strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives.

Geoffrey&#x27;s ordination as a priest took place at Southwell on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported by most of the York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey&#x27;s election was secured in December, when Giovanni d&#x27;Anagni, the papal legate, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment.

In early 1190 Geoffrey ordered a halt to religious ceremonies in the cathedral and excommunicated Henry Marshal and Burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service. Richard, who was in Normandy preparing to go on the Third Crusade, ordered Geoffrey to the king&#x27;s presence in Normandy. Although Hugh du Puiset, who was Justiciar, was hampering Geoffrey&#x27;s attempts to collect revenue for the earlier fine, Richard insisted on immediate full payment. When Geoffrey was unable to pay Richard re-confiscated his lands, increased the amount of the fine, and demanded a promise that Geoffrey would not visit England for three years. The dispute was settled once more when the pope stepped in and ratified Geoffrey&#x27;s election, thus enabling a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop at Tours in June. Geoffrey&#x27;s estates were returned to him in July, after paying 800 marks of his fine.

===Consecration and more difficulties===
Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Barthelemy de Vendôme, the Archbishop of Tours, after the papacy agreed to allow the consecration. This permission was secured by the intervention of the king and his mother, Queen Eleanor. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard&#x27;s support as part of an effort to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop&#x27;s authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey&#x27;s arrest. But the actions of Longchamp&#x27;s agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor&#x27;s arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.

While still embroiled in his conflict with Longchamp, Geoffrey began feuding with Hugh du Puiset, probably over Geoffrey&#x27;s authority in Puiset&#x27;s diocese of Durham, one of those subject to York. The dispute dragged on for years, with many appeals to Rome and the king. York had been vacant for several years, and Puiset had grown used to having untrammelled authority in the northern archdiocese. After Geoffrey&#x27;s consecration, he summoned Puiset to a provincial synod in late September 1191, at which the bishop was charged with various irregularities. Puiset appealed to Rome and refused to attend the synod, and was excommunicated in December by Geoffrey. An attempt in March 1192 by Queen Eleanor and Hubert Walter to settle the issue came to nothing when Geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from Puiset, who in turn demanded an admission from Geoffrey that the excommunication had been unjust. Further appeals to Rome led to an eventual settlement in October 1192, when the bishop finally acknowledged Geoffrey&#x27;s authority over Durham.

Geoffrey caused offence by his attempts to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury, thus implying that his diocese was superior or at least equal to Canterbury in rank. In pursuit of this rivalry between York and Canterbury, Geoffrey was the first archbishop of York to style himself &quot;Primate of England&quot;, in opposition to the Canterbury title of &quot;Primate of all England&quot;. He also attempted to subordinate Clementhorpe Priory to Godstow Abbey, which provoked an appeal from Prioress Alice of Clementhorpe to the papacy. Probably owing to Pope Celestine III&#x27;s dislike of Geoffrey, Hubert Walter was given a papal legateship that included Geoffrey&#x27;s province, something that had not been usual in the preceding years, and which presented Geoffrey with some difficulties in his dealings with the ecclesiastical hierarchy. But Geoffrey was on friendly terms with Prince John; the historian G. V. Scammell has suggested that Geoffrey&#x27;s consecration allowed John to feel that Geoffrey was no longer a rival for the throne, thus paving the way for good relations between the two half-brothers.

Geoffrey long faced opposition from some members of his cathedral chapter led by Henry Marshal, Burchard du Puiset, and Roger of London. They objected to his having given a large part of York&#x27;s treasury toward Richard&#x27;s ransom, and to some of his appointments in the church of York. Charges of simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties were lodged against Geoffrey, who in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. Geoffrey also faced difficulties with his appointees to the office of Dean of York; his first choice, his half-brother Peter, was opposed by the cathedral chapter. Geoffrey&#x27;s second choice, Simon of Apulia, the chancellor of York, refused to give up the office when Geoffrey decided to award it to a third man, Philip of Poitou. Simon was supported by the cathedral chapter, who elected him to the office despite Geoffrey&#x27;s opposition. An appeal was made to the papacy by Geoffrey while Simon travelled to King Richard in Germany. The king refused to allow the appeal and tried to summon Geoffrey to Germany to resolve the issue. Geoffrey was unable to leave York because of disturbances within the cathedral clergy, and Simon managed to secure papal confirmation as Dean of York.

===Quarrels with John, Hubert Walter and Richard===

When Prince John rebelled in 1193, Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset put aside their feud to quash the uprising. Geoffrey strengthened Doncaster&#x27;s defences and went to the aid of Puiset, who was besieging Tickhill Castle. In 1194 Geoffrey went into debt to the crown for the sum of 3000 marks to buy the office of Sheriff of Yorkshire for himself. Later that year Geoffrey began to quarrel with Hubert Walter over the primacy of England, which Canterbury claimed and York disputed. Walter&#x27;s decision to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of York in March 1194 was symbolic of his claim to primacy over York and all of England. Geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury the following month. King Richard did not reprimand Geoffrey for this act of provocation, and even went so far as to restore some of his confiscated estates. Before Richard left England in May 1194 he appointed Walter as Justiciar; that summer Walter began an investigation into Geoffrey&#x27;s actions, which led to Geoffrey&#x27;s estates being confiscated once again. Geoffrey appealed to the king, who was then in Maine; Richard over-ruled Walter, restored Geoffrey&#x27;s estates, and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and the promise of 1000 more to follow.

In January 1195 Geoffrey was ordered to appear in Rome to answer various charges, under the threat of suspension from office if he did not appear by 1 June. Further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed, including an instance of the cathedral chapter throwing chrism on a dungheap in protest. Geoffrey protested to the king after Richard forbade Geoffrey&#x27;s projected journey to Rome and in retaliation the king confiscated Geoffrey&#x27;s estates once more. This left Geoffrey vulnerable when Walter held a legatine council at York in June 1195. Geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at Rome until 1 November, but was still unable to attend, which led Pope Celestine to order that Geoffrey&#x27;s suspension should be performed by Hugh of Lincoln. Hugh protested, and as a result Celestine himself suspended Geoffrey on 23 December 1195, finally forcing Geoffrey to answer the charges against him. He travelled to Rome in 1196, where his accusers were unable to substantiate their claims and he was restored to office by the pope.

Geoffrey quarrelled with Richard in 1196 in Normandy while the archbishop was attempting to return to England. Richard forbade him from administering York, and Geoffrey returned to Rome until 1198. An attempt at reconciliation with Richard came to nothing, after Geoffrey refused to approve the king&#x27;s appointments in the diocese of York without some guarantees that they would be approved by the papacy. Ultimately Pope Innocent III on 28 April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was to be restored to his lands as soon as he had paid his debts to the king. Innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in York would require papal approval.

==Under John==

After John succeeded Richard in 1199, he decided to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but continued to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome. Some of Geoffrey&#x27;s opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and for a short time peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey&#x27;s officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two appear to have been on good terms, a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200.

In October 1200 Geoffrey refused to allow the collection of carucage, a tax on land, on his property, and his lands were confiscated in retaliation. He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire, James of Poterne, who had ravaged Geoffrey&#x27;s lands in revenge. In November 1200, Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln&#x27;s funeral, which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates, but the archbishop&#x27;s continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart. In January 1201, John made peace with his half brother, but it did not last, as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected. John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard&#x27;s reign, which forced Geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace, which occurred in May 1201. But it was short-lived; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out, but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of a few of his own candidates. Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese, with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement. Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements with were Guisborough Priory, Meaux Abbey, and Fountains Abbey. Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices, but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house.

Geoffrey submitted to John in 1206, and his lands were returned to him. But in 1207 Geoffrey led the clergy of England in their refusal to pay royal taxation and was forced into exile. Geoffrey excommunicated anyone who attempted to collect the tax in his archdiocese, but the king confiscated Geoffrey&#x27;s estates in retaliation. Geoffrey once again secured the support of Pope Innocent, who ordered John to restore Geoffrey&#x27;s possessions, but in the meantime the archbishop had fled to France. A medieval chronicler, Geoffrey of Coldingham, stated that the English church considered Geoffrey a martyr because of this stand against King John.

==Death and legacy==
Geoffrey died while still in exile at Grandmont in Normandy on 12 December 1212. He was buried at a Grandmontine monastery near Rouen, where he had been living for a few years. His tomb was still extant in 1767, when the inscription on it was recorded by an antiquary. He may have become a monk before his death.

Although his archiepiscopate was mainly marked by the conflicts in which he engaged, Geoffrey also managed to institute some administrative reforms in his diocese, creating the office of chancellor. He also inspired loyalty from some of his household members, many of whom witnessed his charters, and although he made enemies of several of the suffragan bishops, clergy and religious houses in his diocese, he also secured the friendship and support of other clergy, including Pope Innocent III and Hugh of Lincoln. Although Walter Map declared that Geoffrey was &quot;full of faults and devoid of character&quot;, he remained loyal to his father until Henry&#x27;s death. A modern-day historian, Thomas Jones, summed up Geoffrey&#x27;s character with the phrase &quot;quarrelsome and undiplomatic&quot;. Another historian, J. C. Holt, stated that Geoffrey was through his career &quot;a perpetual source of danger, quarrelling now with de Puiset, now with the Yorkshire sheriffs, ever ready to attack the judicial and fiscal superiority of the Crown.&quot;

Geoffrey&#x27;s ambitions may have included becoming King of England, which may account for some of the harshness that his two legitimate half-brothers displayed towards him. His military abilities, displayed in the rebellion of 1173–1174, as well his custody of castles near Tours, would have also fed into Richard&#x27;s disquiet over Geoffrey&#x27;s possible intentions. Geoffrey was known to be ambitious, which led the historian D. L. Douie to call him a &quot;formidable bastard&quot;. The historian Ralph Turner said of Geoffrey that &quot;he sought power and wealth despite the handicap of his birth&quot; and that he had &quot;inherited the bad temper of the other Plantagenets&quot;.

Geoffrey was a patron of scholarship, and employed scholars throughout his life, one of whom, Honorius of Kent, Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond. Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter and wrote a legal work on canon law. The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed into the hands of Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey&#x27;s death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription. After the king&#x27;s death it passed through several royal owners, regarded as a relic of the saint, before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741.

<doc id="654549" wikidata="Q1519267" url="?curid=654549" title="Omnicom Group">
<text>Omnicom Group Inc. is an American global media, marketing and corporate communications holding company, headquartered in New York City.

Omnicom&#x27;s branded networks and specialty firms provide services in four disciplines: advertising, customer relationship management (CRM), public relations and specialty services. The services included in these disciplines are media planning and buying, digital and interactive marketing, sports and events marketing, field marketing and brand consultancy. 

Omnicom Group acts as the parent company for Omnicom Media Group composed of three agencies (OMD, PHD and Hearts &amp; Science) as well as three global advertising agency networks – BBDO, DDB and TBWA. Omnicom Group also manages Flywheel, DAS Group of Companies (comprising the Health Group, the Precision Marketing Group, the Commerce Group and the Advertising Collective) and the Communications Consultancy Network.

Omnicom Group was ranked as one of the four largest advertising agencies in the world by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2002. In 2014, Omnicom was considered the second largest advertising holding company by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The company employs more than 77,000 employees in over 100 countries worldwide.

==History==
In 1986, Allen Rosenshine, Keith Reinhard and John Bernbach (son of William Bernbach) co-created Omnicom in a three-way merger of BBDO Worldwide, Doyle Dane Bernbach and Needham Harper Worldwide. In 1989, Rosenshine stepped down as chairman of Omnicom to return to his role running BBDO Worldwide and Bruce Crawford (who had preceded Rosenshine as CEO of BBDO before leaving to run the Metropolitan Opera in 1985)
was named chairman of Omnicom. In 1997, John Wren, the number two executive at Omnicom, became the company&#x27;s chief executive officer, while Crawford remained as chairman.

In July 2013, it was announced that Publicis Groupe and Omnicom Group would merge to form Publicis Omnicom Group, but by May 2014 it was announced that the deal had fallen through and the Publicis-Omnicom merger would not happen.

By 2014, Omnicom was the second largest agency holding company and had revenue of over $15 billion. Omnicom launched Omniwomen in April 2014 with the goal of increasing the number and influence of female leaders within the organization. Omniwomen has more than 10 branches in the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, China and the UAE.

In July 2017, Omnicom announced that Gracia Martore, former President and CEO of TEGNA Inc., had joined its Board as an independent director. Her appointment brings the total to 13 directors, 11 of which are independent. In February 2018, Ronnie S. Hawkins was appointed to the company&#x27;s board as an independent director, bringing the total to 14 members, 12 of which are independent. In May 2018, Omnicom Group brought its language strategy agency, maslansky + partners, to Australia.

In November 2021, Daryl Simm was promoted to president and COO. That next month, Florian Adamski was announced as the next CEO of Omnicom Media Group, after previously working as CEO at OMD Worldwide.

In October 2023, Omnicom agreed to acquire Flywheel Digital for $835 million.

The Wall Street Journal reported on December 8, 2024, that Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group (IPG) are in advanced merger discussions. This potential merger could value Interpublic at between $13 billion and $14 billion, excluding debt. If completed, this deal would unite the third and fourth largest advertising firms globally, potentially making the merged entity the world&#x27;s largest advertising company, surpassing WPP in size. On the New York Stock Exchange, the new firm kept the Omnicom name and trade as &quot;OMC,&quot; with John Wren as chairman and CEO of Omnicom and Phil Angelastro as chief financial officer and executive vice president.

==Operations==
Omnicom is composed of five major agency networks that oversee 1500+ agencies as parent companies. The networks are BBDO Worldwide, Diversified Agency Services (DAS), DDB Worldwide, Omnicom Media Group (OMG) and TBWA Worldwide.

BBDO Worldwide, one of the companies present from the initial merger, is a creative agency which has been recognized as one of the most creative networks in the world. Founded in 2000, Proximity Worldwide is BBDO&#x27;s digitally focused marketing arm. In January 2016, BBDO Worldwide acquired a majority stake in Wednesday Agency Group. At the 2017 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, BBDO Worldwide was awarded Network of the Year for the sixth time. Clemenger BBDO Melbourne was named Agency of the Year. BBDO was the top agency network featured in the 2018 WARC 100, an annual ranking of advertising and media effectiveness. In 2018, several of the BBDO agencies were ranked in the top 10 awarded individual agencies in the world by The Gunn Report.

The DAS Group of Companies comprises more than 200 companies focused on public relations, CRM, healthcare, events, promotional marketing, vehicle testing, branding and research. In 2016 and 2017, Omnicom formed two separate holding groups for healthcare and PR agencies: Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Precision Marketing Group. Later in 2016, Omnicom Health Group acquired majority stakes in Biopharm Communications and Rabin Martin. In 2018, Omnicom Health Group acquired Snow Companies a patient engagement communications agency. Also in 2018, Omnicom Precision Marketing Group acquired a majority stake in Credera.

DDB Worldwide, one of the three initial companies, is a global advertising network. In November 2015, DDB Worldwide acquired Grupo ABC, the largest advertising group in Brazil. In June 2016, DDB Health was launched as a combination of healthcare-focused advertising agencies, which added medical and healthcare brand services to DDB&#x27;s profile. Some of the businesses included in the DDB Worldwide unit are Tribal Worldwide, TracyLocke, adam&amp;eveDDB, Roberts + Langer, Spike DDB, Rodgers Townsend, ONC Worldwide, Alma and Uproar!@DDB.

Omnicom Media Group is the media division of the Omnicom Group Inc. In 2017, three Omnicom Media Group agency networks competed at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, including OMD Worldwide, which was named Media Network of the Year.

TBWA is a global agency network, normally billed as &#x27;The Disruption Company&#x27;. It was purchased in 1993 and then merged with the Chiat Day firm in 1995. In the United States, some of the company&#x27;s offices still retain the TBWA\Chiat\Day name. Companies operating under the TBWA network include, Media Arts Lab, Digital Arts Network (DAN), Lucky Generals, Designory, NEBOKO, and other TBWA branded regional agencies.

<text>A Sunday school, sometimes known as a Sabbath school, is an educational institution, usually Christian in character and intended for children or neophytes.

Sunday school classes usually precede a Sunday church service and are used to provide catechesis to Christians, especially children and teenagers, and sometimes adults as well. Churches of many Christian denominations have classrooms attached to the church used for this purpose. Many Sunday school classes operate on a set curriculum, with some teaching attendees a catechism. Members often receive certificates and awards for participation, as well as attendance.

Sunday school classes may provide a light breakfast. On days when Holy Communion is being celebrated, however, some Christian denominations encourage fasting before receiving the Eucharistic elements.

==Early history==
Sunday schools in Europe began with the Catholic Church&#x27;s Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, founded in the 16th century by the archbishop Charles Borromeo to teach young Italian children the faith.

Protestant Sunday schools were first set up in the 18th century in England to provide education to working children. William King started a Sunday school in 1751 in Dursley, Gloucestershire. Robert Raikes, editor of the &quot;Gloucester Journal&quot;, started a similar one in Gloucester in 1781. He wrote an article in his journal, and as a result many clergymen supported schools, which aimed to teach the youngsters reading, writing, cyphering (doing arithmetic) and a knowledge of the Bible.

The Sunday School Society was founded by Baptist deacon William Fox on 7 September 1785 in Prescott Street Baptist Church of London. The latter had been touched by articles of Raikes, on the problems of youth crime. Pastor Thomas Stock and Raikes have thus registered a hundred children from six to fourteen years old. The society has published its textbooks and brought together nearly 4,000 Sunday schools.

In 1785, 250,000 English children were attending Sunday school. There were 5,000 in Manchester alone. By 1835, the Sunday School Society had distributed 91,915 spelling books, 24,232 New Testaments and 5,360 Bibles. The Sunday school movement was cross-denominational. Financed through subscription, large buildings were constructed that could host public lectures as well as provide classrooms. Adults would attend the same classes as the infants, as each was instructed in basic reading. In some towns, the Methodists withdrew from the large Sunday school and built their own. The Anglicans set up their National schools that would act as Sunday schools and day schools. These schools were the precursors to a national system of education.

The educational role of the Sunday schools ended with the Education Act 1870, which provided universal elementary education. In the 1920s they also promoted sports, and ran Sunday school leagues. They became social centres hosting amateur dramatics and concert parties. By the 1960s, the term &quot;Sunday school&quot; could refer to the building and rarely to the activities inside. By the 1970s even the largest Sunday school had been demolished. The locution today chiefly refers to catechism classes for children and adults that occur before the start of a church service. In certain Christian traditions, in certain grades, for example the second grade or eighth grade, Sunday school classes may prepare youth to undergo a rite such as First Communion or Confirmation. The doctrine of Sunday Sabbatarianism, held by many Christian denominations, encourages practices such as Sunday school attendance, as it teaches that the entirety of the Lord&#x27;s Day should be devoted to God; as such many children and teenagers often return to the church in the late afternoon for youth group before attending an evening service of worship.

==Development in Protestant churches==

===United Kingdom===

The first recorded Protestant Sunday school opened in 1751 in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Nottingham. Hannah Ball made another early start, founding a school in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, in 1769. However, the pioneer of Sunday schools is commonly said to be Robert Raikes, editor of the &quot;Gloucester Journal&quot;, who in 1781, after prompting from William King (who was running a Sunday School in Dursley), recognised the need of children living in the Gloucester slums; the need also to prevent them from taking up crime. He opened a school in the home of a Mrs Meredith, operating it on a Sunday – the only day that the boys and girls working in the factories could attend. Using the Bible as their textbook, the children learned to read and write.

In 18th-century England, education was largely reserved for a wealthy, male minority and was not compulsory. The wealthy educated their children privately at home, with hired governesses or tutors for younger children. The town-based middle class may have sent their sons to grammar schools, while daughters were left to learn what they could from their mothers or from their fathers&#x27; libraries. The children of factory workers and farm labourers received no formal education, and typically worked alongside their parents six days a week, sometimes for more than 13 hours a day.

By 1785 over 250,000 children throughout England attended schools on Sundays. In 1784 many new schools opened, including the interdenominational Stockport Sunday School, which financed and constructed a school for 5,000 scholars in 1805. In the late-19th century this was accepted as being the largest in the world. By 1831 it was reported that attendance at Sunday schools had grown to 1.2 million.

The first Sunday school in London opened at Surrey Chapel, Southwark, under Rowland Hill. By 1831 1,250,000 children in Great Britain, or about 25 per cent of the eligible population, attended Sunday schools weekly. The schools provided basic lessons in literacy alongside religious instruction.

In 1833, &quot;for the unification and progress of the work of religious education among the young&quot;, the Unitarians founded their Sunday School Association, as &quot;junior partner&quot; to the British and Foreign Unitarian Association, with which it eventually set up offices at Essex Hall in Central London.

The work of Sunday schools in the industrial cities was increasingly supplemented by &quot;ragged schools&quot; (charitable provision for the industrial poor), and eventually by publicly funded education under the terms of the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75). Sunday schools continued alongside such increasing educational provision, and new forms also developed, such as the Socialist Sunday Schools movement, which began in the United Kingdom in 1886.

===Ireland===
The earliest recorded Sunday school programme in Ireland goes back to 1777, when Daniel Delany, Roman Catholic priest started a school in Tullow, County Carlow. He set up a complex system which involved timetables, lesson plans, streaming, and various teaching activities. This system spread to other parishes in the diocese. By 1787 in Tullow alone there were 700 students, boys and girls, men and women, and 80 teachers. The primary intent of this Sunday school system was the teaching of the Catholic catechism and articles of faith; the teaching of reading and writing became necessary to assist in this. With the coming of Catholic Emancipation in Ireland (1829) and the establishment of the National Schools system (1831), which meant that the Catholic faith could be taught in school, the Catholic Sunday school system became unnecessary.

The Church of Ireland Sunday School Society was founded by the established Anglican Protestant church in 1809. The Sabbath School Society of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland was founded in 1862.

=== Sweden ===
The concept of Sunday school in Sweden started in the early to mid-1800s, initially facing some backlash, before becoming more mainstream, as it was often intertwined with the growth (and eventual legalization) of free churches. The first documented Sunday school was started in 1826 in Snavlunda parish, Örebro County, by priest Ringzelli, and was still active during the time of Pastor Lennart Sickeldal in the 1950s. Ringzelli was also an early organizer of school meals for students who lived far from the school or were from poor families.

Carl Ludvig Tellström, later missionary to the Sámi people, made another early attempt to start a Sunday school around 1834. While in Stockholm, he was converted by George Scott, an influential Scottish Wesleyan Methodist preacher who worked in Sweden from 1830 to 1842 and was controversial due to his preaching in violation of the Conventicle Act. Within the Church of Sweden, however, based on the format of Methodist Sunday schools, he started several in Flykälen, Föllinge, Ottsjön, Storå, and Tuvattnet.

Later, Mathilda Foy founded an early Sunday school in 1843–1844. Influenced by Pietistic revivalist preachers such as Scott, and particularly Carl Olof Rosenius, Foy found herself part of the &quot;läsare&quot; (Reader) movement. Always engaged in charitable work, she started a Sunday school not long after her spiritual awakening. However, it was soon closed due to the protests of clergy, who considered it &quot;Methodist&quot;. Another attempt by Augusta Norstedt was noted around the same time.

Sometime between 1848 and 1856, educator and preacher Amelie von Braun, also part of the revivalist awakening movement, started a Sunday school primarily teaching children Bible stories. She worked within the state church. Her Sunday school was supported by Peter Fjellstedt and grew quickly, with 250 students noted in 1853.

Around 1851, Sunday schools were established by Foy&#x27;s friends Betty Ehrenborg (1818–1880) and Per Palmqvist (1815–1887), brother of Swedish Baptist pioneers Johannes and Gustaf Palmquist. That year, Ehrenborg and the brothers traveled to London. The brothers, at least, reconnected with Scott, whom they knew from Sweden. In England, they studied the Methodists&#x27; Sunday schools and teaching methods, impressed by the number of students and teachers. There were over 250 children and 20 to 30 teachers; classes were taught by laypeople and included literacy training in addition to Bible lessons, singing, and prayer.

Upon Palmqvist&#x27;s return to Sweden, he invited 25 local poor children and founded the first Baptist Sunday school; the same year, Ehrenborg began a Sunday school as well, with 13 mostly Baptist and free-church students. Palmqvist was given £5 in financial support by the London Sunday School Association and used the money to travel to Norrland, home of a significant revival movement, to spread the idea of Sunday school there. The first Sunday school association in Sweden, Stockholms Lutherska Söndagsskolförening, was started in 1868. However, even despite the abolition of the Conventicle Act in 1858 and increasing religious freedom, there were still challenges: Palmqvist was reported to the Stockholm City Court by a priest in 1870 for teaching children who did not belong to his congregation, but was later acquitted.

In Stockholm alone, there were 29 Sunday schools by 1871. By 1915 there were 6,518 Sunday schools in the country among a number of denominations, with 23,058 officers and teachers and 317,648 students.

=== Finland ===
The first Sunday schools in Finland were run by the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, with the first one founded in 1807. They were often for those who had not become literate. As a form of schooling, they were recommended by the state in 1853. Some Sunday schools gave vocational training in the trades; after 1858 they were also preparatory schools for further education held during the week. However, Sunday schools did not catch on until the later growth of free churches in the country as well as the establishment of public schooling, at which point they became a form of children&#x27;s religious education. One of the earliest free-church Sunday schools was founded by sisters Netta and Anna Heikel in Jakobstad in the 1860s. More Sunday schools were soon founded in the 1870s and 1880s: in Vaasa – including by the local Lutheran parish, in Kotka, Turku, Åland, Helsinki, Ekenäs, Hanko, and other cities.

===United States===

The first organized and documented Sunday school in the United States was founded in Ephrata, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, by an immigrant from Germany, Ludwig Höcker, the son of a well-respected and influential Reformed Church Pastor and teacher in Westerwald. Ludwig immigrated in the 1730s and joined the Sabbatarian Ephrata Cloister in 1739, where he soon created the Sunday school for the impoverished children of the area, and published, on the Ephrata Press, a full textbook.
Rev. Ira Lee Cottrell writes:&quot;It is especially interesting to us to know that a Seventh Day Baptist Sabbath school was organized about 1740, forty years before Robert Raikes Sunday-school. This Sabbath school was organized at Ephrata, Pa., by Ludwig Hocker among the Seventh Day Baptist Germans, and continued until 1777, when their room with others was given up for hospital purposes after the battle of Brandywine…&quot;.

In New England a Sunday school system was first begun by Samuel Slater in his textile mills in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in the 1790s. 

In the mid-1860s philanthropist Lewis Miller was the inventor of the &quot;Akron Plan&quot; for Sunday schools. It was a building layout with a central assembly hall surrounded by small classrooms, conceived with Methodist minister John Heyl Vincent and architect Jacob Snyder. It was soon widely copied.

John Heyl Vincent collaborated with Baptist layman B. F. Jacobs, who devised a system to encourage Sunday school work, and a committee was established to provide the International Uniform Lesson Curriculum, also known as the &quot;Uniform Lesson Plan&quot;. By the 1800s 80% of all new members were introduced to the church through Sunday school.

In 1874, interested in improving the training of Sunday school teachers for the Uniform Lesson Plan, Miller and Vincent worked together again to found what is now the Chautauqua Institution on the shores of Chautauqua Lake, New York.

Increasingly the public elementary schools were handling literacy. In response the Sunday schools switched to an emphasis on Bible stories, hymn singing, and memorizing Biblical passages. The main goal was encouraging the conversion experience that was so important to evangelicals. 

Notable 20th-century leaders in the Sunday school movement include: President Jimmy Carter, Clarence Herbert Benson, Henrietta Mears, founder of Gospel Light, Dr. Gene A. Getz, Howard Hendricks, Lois E. LeBar, Lawrence O. Richards, and Elmer Towns.

==Form==

In Evangelical churches, during worship service, children and young people receive an adapted education, in Sunday school, in a separate room.

Historically, Sunday schools were held in the afternoons in various communities, and were often staffed by workers from varying denominations. Beginning in the United States in the early 1930s and Canada in the 1940s, the transition was made to Sunday mornings. Sunday school often takes the form of a one-hour or longer Bible study, which can occur before, during, or after a church service. While many Sunday schools are focused on providing instruction for children (especially those sessions occurring during service times), adult Sunday-school classes are also popular and widespread (see RCIA). In some traditions, the term &quot;Sunday school&quot; is too strongly associated with children, and alternate terms such as &quot;Adult Electives&quot; or &quot;religious education&quot; are used instead of &quot;Adult Sunday school&quot;. Some churches only operate Sunday school for children concurrently with the adult worship service. In this case, there is typically no adult Sunday school.

==Publishers==
In Great Britain an agency was formed called the Religious Tract Society which helped provide literature for the Sunday school.

In the United States the American Sunday School Union was formed (headquartered in Philadelphia) for the publication of literature. This group helped pioneer what became known as the International Sunday School Lessons. The &quot;Sunday School Times&quot; was another periodical they published for the use of Sunday schools. LifeWay Christian Resources, Herald and Banner Press, David C. Cook, and Group Publishing are among the widely available published resources currently used in Sunday schools across the country.

==Teachers==
Sunday school teachers are usually lay people who are selected for their role in the church by a designated coordinator, board, or a committee. Normally, the selection is based on a perception of character and ability to teach the Bible, rather than formal training in education. Some Sunday school teachers, however, do have a background in education as a result of their occupations. Some churches require Sunday school teachers and catechists to attend courses to ensure that they have a sufficient understanding of the faith and of the teaching process to educate others. Other churches allow volunteers to teach without training; a profession of faith and a desire to teach is all that is required in such cases.

It is also not uncommon for Catholic or Protestant pastors to teach such classes themselves. Some well-known public figures who teach, or have taught, Sunday school include Space Shuttle astronaut Ronald J. Garan Jr., comedian Stephen Colbert, novelist John Grisham, and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter.

<text>Badi&#x27; al-Zamān al-Hamadānī or al-Hamadhānī (; ; 969 in Hamadan، Iran – 1007) was a medieval poet and man of letters. He is best known for his work the &quot;Maqamat Badi&#x27; az-Zaman al-Hamadhani&quot;, a collection of 52 episodic stories of a rogue, Abu al-Fath al-Iskandari, as recounted by a narrator, &#x27;Isa b. Hisham. His Persian name, Hamedani, translates to &quot;from the city of Hamedan.&quot; His Arabic name translates into &quot;The Wonder of the Age&quot;.

==Life==
Very little is known about Al-Hamadani’s early life and primary sources are very limited. The main biographical account comes from Al-Tha&#x27;alibi, and most later biographies are derived from that. According to al-Hamadani’s own account, he was of Arab descent and his family had some education, but scholars have disputed these bare facts. He was probably born and educated in Hamadan, Iran.

More is known about Al-Hamadani’s adult life. In 380/990, al-Hamadhani, then aged 22, left his native city and began travelling to the various centres of learning. At the time, scholarly travel was an accepted practice for young, educated Arabic men. His first stop was at Rayy, possibly to meet up with his former mentor, Ahmed Ibn Faris (ref: Prendergast gives the instructor’s name as Abdul Husain ibn Faris; See https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n17). There he came under the patronage of Dihkhuda Abu Aid Muhammad ibn Mansur al-Isma (d. 410/1019). He next travelled to Jurjan where he began writing maqamat and where his literary talents found a receptive audience.

In 383/992, he travelled to Khorasan, Nishapur, then under Samanid rule, and an established centre of literature. His experience of Khorasan was mixed. He was robbed several times by highwaymen, losing all of his possessions. However, his literary output became more prolific. He was in competition with al-Khawrizmi and eventually fell out with him. In Nishapur, he achieved great fame and his reputation spread throughout the region.

After Nishapur was conquered by the Ghaznavids he departed the region and returned to his travels. On the road, he stopped at Sarakhs, Tus and Marw. Some early sources, such as the Persian scholar, ath-Thalibi, suggest that Al-Hamadani also visited Sijistan and Ghazna. However, very little is known of such travels and reliable evidence is thin, leading scholars to caution that, as al-Hamadani’s fame grew, such visits became the stuff of legend.

In 383/993, he stopped at Zaranj, where he was received at the court of the Saffarid ruler, Abu Ahmad Khalaf ibn Ahdmad. Al-Hamadani’s intentions were to eulogise the ruler, for which he was well rewarded.

His movements, following his sojourn in Zaranj, are obscure. He eventually settled in Bushanj, near Herat where he married into the Abu-‘Ali Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Khushnami, a local noble family and spent his final years . His literary output declined during his period of residency at Herat. After he settled in Herat, he came under the protection of Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Isfaraini, who was the vizier of Mahmud of Ghazni, the sultan of the Ghaznavid dynasty. He died at Herat, at the age of forty. He was renowned for a remarkable memory and for fluency of speech, as well as for the purity of his language.

His letters were first published at Constantinople (1881), and with commentary at Beirut (1890); his maqamas at Constantinople, and with commentary at Beirut (1889). Selected letters have been published in works, such as Silvestre de Sacy&#x27;s edition of six of the maqamas with French translation and notes in his Chrestomathie arabe, vol. iii. (2nd ed., Paris, 1827). A specimen of the translated letters can be found A. von Kremers &quot;Culturgeschichte des Orients&quot;, ii. 470 sqq (in German).

==Literary work==

Al-Hamadani wrote poetry and many of his letters have survived. He is generally regarded as the originator of the genre known as ‘’maqama&quot;(sing) or ‘’maqamat’’ (pl). Al-Hamadani’s maqama made use of anecdotes collected in the 9th century by earlier writers, such as al-Jahiz and al-Taniikhi, but had a narrator introduce the anecdote.

Al-Hamadani’s innovation was to apply saj&#x27; (an ornate form of rhymed prose), to the retelling of secular anecdotes. Until that time, saj’ had been confined to religious and political works. The form was subsequently imitated by other Arabic poets and writers. A century later, the writer, Al-Hariri of Basra elevated the maqamat into a major literary art form.

Al-Hamadani’s &quot;Maqama&quot; made use of anecdotes collected in the 9th century by earlier writers, such as al-Jahiz and al-Taniikhi, but had a narrator introduce the anecdote. Al-Hamadani’s innovation was to apply saj’, to the retelling of secular anecdotes. Until that time, saj’ had been confined to religious and political works.

A total of 52 of al-Hamadani’s maqama have been preserved in manuscripts. Each maqama is a complete story, but maqama are often presented in a collection with an overarching theme. Each story has two main characters, the narrator, (usually Isa ibn Hisham) and a protagonist, (usually Abu I-Fath of Alexandria, who is a rogue and a trickster). Other characters, often historical characters, are introduced in different stories. The anecdotes, presented in al-Hamadani’s maqamat played into a growing interest in the activities of Arabic low-life, especially beggars, tricksters and criminals.

The maqama follows a loose structure of seven parts, namely (1) Isnad, (2) general introduction, (3) link (4) episode (the core of the narrative), (5) recognition scene, (6) envoi and (7) finale.

Stylistically, maqama employ &quot; Saj&#x27;&quot;, a highly polished and elaborate prose. Parts of the narrative may be written in verse, while other parts are written in unrhymed, literary prose. Most of the verse used by al-Hamadhani was borrowed from notable poets.

Baranski was featured as Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s sarcastic, hard-drinking friend Maryann Thorpe in the CBS sitcom &quot;Cybill&quot;, which ran from 1995 until 1998, during which time she hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and won an Emmy Award as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series along with three other nominations. During this, Baranski portrayed a librarian named Sonja Umdahl in the &quot;Dick and the Single Girl&quot; episode of &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;. A few years later, Baranski received an Emmy nomination for a guest starring role in the NBC series &quot;Frasier&quot; as a controversial tough love radio psychiatrist named Dr. Nora. The episode, which was named for the character, parodied Dr. Laura Schlessinger. The episode was pulled from syndication by Paramount. Baranski had an uncredited role in the series &quot;Now and Again&quot; as the voice of Roger&#x27;s overbearing wife Ruth, who was never seen by viewers.

Baranski later appeared in the 2000–2001 sitcom &quot;Welcome to New York&quot; and, with John Laroquette, in the 2003–2004 NBC sitcom &quot;Happy Family&quot;. She co-starred with Bernadette Peters in a pilot for an ABC sitcom, &quot;Adopted&quot;, in 2005, which was not picked up. She also played Faith Clancy, the mother of Jim Clancy in &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;. In 2009, Baranski began guest-starring in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; as Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, a dispassionate psychiatrist and neuroscientist and mother of one of the protagonists, Leonard Hofstadter. She first appeared in the second-season episode &quot;The Maternal Capacitance&quot;, for which she received an Emmy nomination. Due to the popularity of her first appearance, Baranski returned in the third season for the Christmas episode &quot;The Maternal Congruence&quot;, receiving another Emmy nomination. She appeared in a total of 16 episodes during the show&#x27;s run, earning four Emmy nominations for her recurring role.

From 2009 to 2016, Baranski played the role of Diane Lockhart, a top litigator and senior partner of a Chicago law firm on the CBS series &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for six seasons of the series, in the years 2010 to 2015. Besides her work on &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and the aforementioned guest appearances on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, her other recent appearances include &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; in 2009 as Victoria Hartley, the haughty mother of Betty&#x27;s new boyfriend.

From 2017 to 2022, Baranski starred in the CBS spinoff of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, titled &quot;The Good Fight&quot;. Her character, Diane Lockhart, joins another law firm after being forced to return to work. In the 79th Golden Globe Awards, she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her work in the fifth season of the show. Since 2022 she has portrayed Agnes van Rhijn in the Julian Fellowes-created HBO period drama &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; starring opposite Carrie Coon, Louisa Jacobson, and Cynthia Nixon. The cast received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

==Acting style and screen persona==
Although recognized for her versatility across genres and performing media, Baranski is particularly known for playing sophisticated and highly educated upper-class women. Consequently, the media began alluding to the resemblance between this repeated on-screen persona and Baranski&#x27;s real personality. Caroline Hallemann of &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; notes that, &quot;For years, the award-winning actress has been the definition of on-screen sophistication.&quot; In 2017, the actress told Zac Posen for &quot;Interview Magazine&quot;, &quot;What I&#x27;m getting at is if your career is not predicated on just your physical beauty, you&#x27;re able to project a sophistication. You can take &quot;sophisticated&quot; to your grave. You can be that worldly woman, that woman who looks beautiful dressed up.&quot; On the other hand, Baranski humorously addressed these claims during her appearance on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, &quot;Everybody thinks this is, you know, this sophisticated lady, this New York type, these characters that I play, they think that&#x27;s me. They should be in a room alone with me when I watch the Buffalo Bills. It is loud.&quot;

==Personal life==
Baranski was married to actor Matthew Cowles from October 1983 until his death on May 22, 2014. Together, they had two daughters, Isabel (b. 1984), a lawyer, and Lily (b. 1987), an actress. She lives in Connecticut. , Baranski was a practicing Catholic, at times accompanying her friend Robert King, the co-creator of &quot;The Good Fight,&quot; on the walk home following Sunday services.

The county borough was historically split between Denbighshire and Flintshire, with it all later being part of the county of Clwyd.

The county borough is flat in the east and hilly in the west. The long salient to the south-west incorporates most of the Ceiriog Valley and includes part of the Berwyn range. The River Ceiriog forms part of the Shropshire border in its lower stages before meeting the Dee east of Chirk. The Dee itself enters the county borough near Cefn Mawr and flows east and then north-east toward Cheshire, creating a wide plain. It forms part of the border before fully entering England at the county borough&#x27;s north-east corner. The north-west of the county borough, down to Chirk, is part of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB, and includes the Ruabon Moors uplands.

Wrexham includes the remains of two significant medieval castles: Chirk, which is now a country house, and Holt, of which only fragments remain. The county borough has a strong industrial history; a notable early business is Bersham Ironworks, in the Clywedog Valley, which operated between 1715 and 1812 and pioneered cannon manufacture. The area is part of the North Wales Coalfield and significant mining took place in the nineteenth century. Tanning and brewing were also significant industries. The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct near Cefn Mawr is an important surviving piece of early industrial infrastructure and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The contemporary economy of the county borough has diversified into industries such as engineering, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and food processing, with agriculture dominant in the south-east and south-west. The county borough also contains Wrexham University, one of Wales&#x27; three Roman Catholic cathedrals, Wrexham Industrial Estate and the UK&#x27;s largest prison, HMP Berwyn.

== History ==
===Borough status===
In 1848, concerns over the sanitary conditions, in particular the threat of cholera, in the growing town of Wrexham, led to locals launching a petition in February 1857 for the town to be incorporated. In September 1857, the town was granted a charter, spanning the two townships of the town, Wrexham Abbot and Wrexham Regis, as well as part of Esclusham Below, and forming the borough of Wrexham, with a borough council (a corporation) and mayor under the terms of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. During incorporation the town was also given a coat of arms.

Between 1894 and 1974, as part of Denbighshire; the remaining civil parishes surrounding but excluding the town were part of the Wrexham Rural District, civil parishes in the Maelor region were part of the Overton Rural District, renamed Maelor Rural District in 1953. Whereas civil parishes in Chirk and the Ceiriog Valley were from 1894 part of either the Chirk Rural District or Llansillin Rural District, until they were merged into the Ceiriog Rural District in 1935, and abolished in 1974 to become part of Clwyd&#x27;s Glyndŵr district.

The Local Government Act 1958 formed the Local Government Commission for Wales tasked to review the potential reform of local government in Wales. In their 1963 report, the commission rejected proposals for the establishment of Wrexham as a county borough.

=== Status within Clwyd, then as County Borough ===
The borough of Wrexham, Wrexham Rural District (except Llangollen Rural and Llantysilio), Marford and Hoseley (from Hawarden Rural District, Flintshire) and the neighbouring Flintshire exclave of the Maelor Rural District, were abolished in 1974, all being absorbed into the Wrexham Maelor district of the then administrative county of Clwyd. Chirk and the Ceiriog Valley were part of the Glyndŵr district.

Clwyd itself was abolished in 1996 as an administrative county, becoming a preserved county for ceremonial lieutenancy purposes.

Wrexham was established as a county borough (a principal area; same powers as counties in Wales) in 1996, containing all of the former Clwyd district of Wrexham Maelor, and the communities of Chirk, Glyntraian, Llansantffraid Glyn Ceiriog and Ceiriog Ucha from the Glyndŵr district.

Following formation in 1996, there were discussions over the boundary between the newly created principal areas of Denbighshire and Wrexham County Borough, in particular over the lower Dee Valley and Llangollen area. Llangollen, Llangollen Rural and Llantysillio were all considered to potentially all or partly become part of Wrexham County Borough. Referendums were held in the communities, with the community of Llangollen Rural, originally in Denbighshire in 1996, transferred to Wrexham County Borough in 1997 through the enacting of &quot;The Denbighshire and Wrexham (Areas) Order 1996&quot; on 1 April 1997.

Referendums by Llangollen Town Council were held in 1993 and 2000, with the latter resulting in a narrow majority of nineteen votes for staying in Denbighshire, and the Welsh Assembly accepting the result by confirming the boundaries in 2002.

On 1 September 2022, the county borough was awarded city status on behalf of Wrexham&#x27;s application.

==Geography==
Wrexham County Borough is a landlocked principal area in Wales. It is a &quot;border county&quot; in the Welsh Marches border region. It is bordered by the English counties of Cheshire to the east and Shropshire to the south and south-east, and the Welsh counties of Flintshire to the north, Denbighshire to the west, and Powys to the south-west.

Parts of the Berwyn range and Maesyrchen Mountains, some part of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty since 2011, border the county borough to its west. To the east across the River Dee, the county borough meets the Cheshire Plain.

The county borough&#x27;s boundaries can be characterised by two protrusions from the largely contiguous borders surrounding the city of Wrexham, sometimes defined as Maelor Gymraeg (meaning &quot;Welsh Maelor&quot;). To the south-east of the city, across the River Dee, the English Maelor (; a former part of Historic Flintshire) extends to almost meet the English town of Whitchurch, Shropshire and Fenn&#x27;s Moss. To the south-west, a large salient of the county borough to the west of Chirk, along the River Ceiriog and the surrounding Ceiriog Valley meets the Berwyn range and the Powys border. The highest point in the county borough is Craig Berwyn, rising 790 metres on the Wrexham-Powys border in the Berwyn range.

There are two upland areas in the county borough, both located on its western edge. The Berwyn mountains, and the Ruabon and Esclusham Mountains. The Berwyns and Ruabon Mountain are designated SSSIs and SACs.

The county borough is within the preserved county of Clwyd, and between 1974 and 1996 as part of the then administrative county of Clwyd, the present-day county borough was divided into the districts of Wrexham Maelor and Glyndŵr. Before Clwyd&#x27;s establishment in 1974, the modern-day county borough was part of the historic counties of Denbighshire (spanning most of the modern-day county borough; including Wrexham), and Flintshire (the English Maelor exclave).

Offa&#x27;s and Wat&#x27;s Dyke, and their respective pathways (Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path, and Wat&#x27;s Dyke Way) pass through the county borough. Other pathways include the Dee Way Walk, and Maelor Way. The Fenn&#x27;s, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve is located in the south-east of the county borough along the Wrexham-Shropshire border.

The county borough is largely urban and industrial surrounding Wrexham, but largely rural for the rest of the county borough, with areas of farmland and rural estates. Woodlands cover 9.4% of the county borough, lower than the national average of 14%.

The main settlement of the county borough is the city of Wrexham with 44,785 inhabitants in 2021. Its neighbouring villages include Gwersyllt, Rhostyllen, Brymbo, Bradley and New Broughton. These, along with Wrexham, formed Wales&#x27; fourth largest urban area with 65,692 inhabitants in 2011. The sole other town in the county borough is Chirk. The main villages of the county borough are Rhosllanerchrugog, Ruabon, Cefn Mawr, Coedpoeth, Gresford, Llay, Holt, Llansantffraid Glyn Ceiriog, Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog, Bangor-on-Dee and Marchwiel.

Rhosllanerchrugog&#x27;s built-up area extends to Ruabon, Cefn Mawr and Acrefair, with a total population of 25,362 in 2011.

There are of principal rivers in the county borough, including the River Dee, Ceiriog, Alyn and Clywedog, as well as important streams.

The River Dee is the main river in the county borough, flowing from Denbighshire in the west into the county borough passing Froncysyllte, under Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, and passing Chirk, until it flows north-east towards England, cutting off the county borough&#x27;s south-east salient of Maelor Saesneg (meaning &quot;English Maelor&quot;) and later forming part of the border between Wales and England. River Alyn, a tributary of the Dee, flows in the north of the county borough.

There are various small lakes in the county borough. While there are 3000 ponds, mainly concentrated in Hanmer, Maelor and Overton.

There is a veteran tree, said to be over 1,000 years old, near Chirk, known as the Oak at the Gate of the Dead. There are also some caves under Esclusham Mountain to the west of the county borough, with caves such as: Ogof Dydd Byraf and Ogof Llyn Parc.

=== Country parks ===

There are eleven urban and country parks in the county borough operated by Wrexham council. These include all the country parks, three urban parks in Wrexham and Ponciau, as well as the Nant Mill Visitor Centre and Brynkinalt Park. The seven country parks in the county borough are: Alyn Waters, Bonc-yr-Hafod, Erddig Park, Minera Leadmines, Moss Valley, Stryt Las Park, and Tŷ Mawr.

There are two country house estates with significant areas of parkland and woodland, those being at Brynkinalt (near Chirk; with the Brynkinalt Park; also known as Chirk Green being council-operated), and at Erddig (National Trust-operated; south of Wrexham). Iscoyd Park in Maelor Saesneg also boasts some parkland.

Nant Mill hosts a Visitor Centre on the Clywedog Trail and is surrounded by woodland, whereas Stryt Las Park between Rhos and Johnstown hosts grassland, woodland and ponds. Both are operated by the council.

Wrexham city has two main city parks, Bellevue Park, and Acton Park, there is also a city centre green in-front of the council&#x27;s Guildhall. Rhosllanerchrugog and Ponciau have Ponciau Banks Park as their urban park.

87% of the population in the county borough is within two miles of the main parks in the county borough. The remaining areas are already largely rural, in particular the Ceiriog valley and English Maelor.

Clywedog Trail spans for along the River Clywedog, from the Minera Lead Mines to King&#x27;s Mills. Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path passes through the county borough.

Bonc-yr-Hafod and Stryt Las are both part of the Stryt Las a&#x27;r Hafod Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

==Politics and local government==
The principal area (styled as a &quot;county borough&quot;) is governed by Wrexham County Borough Council, a Welsh local authority principal council. Most offices of the council are situated within Wrexham city centre, around Llwyn Isaf and Chester Street. The headquarters of the council&#x27;s Chief Executive is at the Guildhall (; ) in Wrexham. From May 2022, there are forty-nine electoral wards for the council, with seven having two councillors.

The most recent Wrexham County Borough election on 5 May 2022, resulted in independent politicians maintaining their position as the largest group with 23 members but falling short of a majority, leaving the council in no overall control. Since 2017, the principal council has been operated by a coalition of local independents, the &quot;Wrexham Independents&quot; group and the Conservatives. Following the 2022 election, on 11 May 2022, local independents and the separately organised &quot;Wrexham Independents&quot; merged into a 21-member &quot;Independent Group&quot;, and formed a coalition with the Conservatives again for another five-year term. The next election for the council is due for 6 May 2027, as part of the next Welsh local elections.
The county borough was formed on 1 April 1996 following the enactment of the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, containing the district of Wrexham Maelor and some communities of Glyndŵr, namely Chirk, Glyntraian, Llansantffraid Glyn Ceiriog, and Ceiriog Ucha, and later Llangollen Rural in 1997. Borough status was inherited from the town of Wrexham, which was granted to the then town in September 1857.

The area includes a portion of the eastern half of the historic county of Denbighshire and two exclaves of historic Flintshire: English Maelor and the parish of Marford and Hoseley.

The county borough is in the East Wales ITL 2 (formerly NUTS 2) and &quot;Flintshire and Wrexham&quot; ITL 3 (formerly NUTS 3) statistical regions by the UK&#x27;s Office for National Statistics (and until 2020 Eurostat). It is regarded to be in the North East Wales and North Wales non-administrative regions (and the associated regional bodies, such as North Wales Economic Ambition Board, North Wales Police, North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Tourism Partnership North Wales, and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board).

In Westminster, from the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Wrexham County Borough is split between three UK Parliament constituencies, Clwyd East, Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, and Wrexham.

In the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), Wrexham County Borough is split into two Senedd constituencies, Clwyd South and Wrexham, each electing a Member of the Senedd (MS) each. The county borough is also part of the North Wales Senedd region which elects a further four regional members.

Polling done by UnHerd in 2019, showed that of those polled 54% of the county borough supported the continued reign of the British Monarch, compared to 23% and 21% opposed, and 23% and 25% do not know, in the Wrexham and Clwyd South constituencies respectively.

In the 2016 National Survey for Wales, only 45.9% of the population agreed or strongly agreed that Wrexham County Borough Council provides quality services, below the Welsh average of 59.3%.

=== Local recent political history ===
On 23 June 2016 in the 2016 EU referendum, the county borough voted in favour of Leave.

In the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Conservative candidates won the constituencies of Wrexham and Clwyd South for the first time in their existence. The constituencies were generally considered to be Labour heartlands part of its &quot;red wall&quot;, and were won by Labour in the June 2017 election, as well as previous elections. In the 2021 Senedd election, Welsh Labour incumbents for the Senedd constituencies of Wrexham and Clwyd South covering the county borough were re-elected.

In 2021, the council submitted bids for UK City of Culture 2025 on behalf of the county borough although later lost to Bradford, and a separate bid, submitted in December 2021, to award the then town of Wrexham the status of a city for the civic honours awarded for the 2022 Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, which it later won. It was the only city bid from Wales, and Wrexham has applied for city status three other times, in 2000, 2002 and 2012, with the 2012 bid lost to St Asaph, Denbighshire. City status was awarded to the &quot;County Borough of Wrexham&quot; on behalf of Wrexham on 1 September 2022. In November 2021, a local consulation survey conducted by Wrexham council, reported that 61% of respondents stated that Wrexham does not &quot;deserve&quot; to be a city.

In February 2024, a report from Audit Wales, stated that the council&#x27;s planning members had a poor relationship with professional officers over planning decisions and the council frequently undermine officers, looking for alternative opinions instead. Audit Wales also criticised the council&#x27;s failure to adopt its local development plan. In March 2024, The Municipal Journal, stated that an investigation had begun into an allegation of malfeasance in office by Wrexham councillors, with both North Wales Police and the Welsh Government participating in the case.

The other largest sectors from the 2011 census include: 15.2% in the Wholesale and retail sector (including vehicle repair), 14.6% health sector, 8.9% education, 6.9% construction, 6.0% government and military, 4.9% accommodation and food service, 4.4% administration and support services, 4.3% transport, 3.9% professional, scientific and technical, 2.8% finance and industry, 1.8% IT and 8% other. When classed together the public sector counts for more than a third of jobs in the county borough. 75% of the total land in the county borough is managed by farmers.

=== Brewing ===
====History====

In the 19th century, a brewing industry developed in Wrexham town, alongside the then town&#x27;s existing leather and coal industry. The town became a brewing centre due to the town&#x27;s good underground water supplies near but not of the River Gwenfro. The sands and gravels in the surrounding river plain filters groundwater which builds up on the impervious rocks beneath. Wrexham also sits above a faultline, dividing the area into a mineral-rich hard water east suitable for brewing beer, and a soft water west for lager. Many breweries were also set up in the medieval times in the township of Wrexham Abbot which would have had lower taxes than Wrexham Regis, the areas controlled by the Crown. By the 1860s, there were 19 breweries in the town. Many brewers became leading politicians in the town, with two brewers, Thomas Rowland and Peter Walker disagreeing who should be mayor of Wrexham.

Wrexham Lager has been brewed in Wrexham since 1882. The brewery produced the first German-brewed lager in the United Kingdom, and was located in Wrexham for the brewing quality of its underground spring water. The lager was reputedly served on board the Titanic, other White Star Line ships and by soldiers during the Siege of Khartoum. It is also claimed to be the first lager to been exported to countries such as India, South Africa, Australia and various countries in the Americas. The brand started to decline during the World wars, following changing consumer tastes, rationalisation, and the internationalisation of the industry. The brewery was bought by Ind Coope &amp; Allsopp, eventually merged into Allied Breweries and later Carlsberg-Tetley. The original brewery located on top of the Gwenfro was closed by Carlsberg in 2000, with all UK-wide production by Carlsberg of the brand ceasing in 2002. The modern brewery, constructed in the late-20th century, was demolished between 2002 and 2003, and was replaced with Wrexham Central Retail Park. The original brewhouse building on Central Road within the now retail park remains as a Grade II listed building.

Another known brewery formerly operating in Wrexham was Soames&#x27;s Brewery, and what later became Border Breweries. The brewery can be traced back to a minor brewing business operating out of the Nag&#x27;s Head Public House on Tuttle Street. It was not until 1874 following an acquisition, that &quot;Wrexham Brewery&quot; started to become a major producer. In his 1892 tour, Alfred Barnard described Soames&#x27;s to have the best beer in Wrexham. The Border Breweries company was formed from the merger of Soames Wrexham Brewery, Island Green Brewery and Dorsett Owen in 1931. It was purchased by Marston&#x27;s Brewery in 1984 and closed by Marston&#x27;s six months later despite stating otherwise. Other former breweries include Albion, Cambrian, Eagle, Island Green, and Willow.

=====Present day=====

In 2011, the Wrexham Lager brand was revived, launched in the Buck House Hotel in Bangor-on-Dee, it later moved to a newly built high-tech microbrewery on St. George&#x27;s Crescent to the east of Wrexham city centre from the original brewery.

In recent years, the lager has experienced success, with the lager in 2022 announced it will be sold in Aldi stores across Wales and England.

, the other microbreweries currently set up in the county borough include: Big Hand Microbrewery (Wrexham Ind. Est.), Magic Dragon Brewery (Plassey), McGivern Ales (Ruabon), and Sandstone Brewery.

=== Red brick ===
Ruabon to the west of the county borough has a deep history in brick and tile-making. This is owed to its vast amounts of high quality Etruria Marl clay. In the 19th century this clay was the centrepiece for Ruabon&#x27;s tile and terracotta production on a vast scale, leading the village to be nicknamed &quot;Terracottapolis&quot;. Its former manufacturing speciality the &quot;Ruabon Red Brick&quot; were used in various buildings of the Victorian era, such as the Pierhead Building in Cardiff, Victoria Building of Liverpool University and in the restoration of the Taj Mahal. Hafod Brickworks were established near Hafod Colliery in 1878, and a &quot;Red Works&quot; in 1893. The bricks contributed to the term &quot;redbrick&quot; in the term &quot;Red brick university&quot;. Brick production largely ceased in the 1970s, with production mainly focused on quarry tiles.

=== Former mining ===
In 1854, there were 26 coal mines operating in the western uplands of Wrexham. The main mines were located at Ruabon, Rhos, Acrefair, Brymbo and Broughton (particularly around the Moss Valley). Mining operations were later concentrated, with larger colleries such as Westminster, Hafod (now Bonc-yr-Hafod park), Bersham, Wynnstay, Wrexham and Acton, Llay Hall and Gatewen commencing operations. By the 20th century, two deep coal pits were dug, one at Gresford opening in 1911, and another at Llay Main. In 1934, a colliery disaster in Gresford killed 261 miners, with 3 rescuers also killed in the rescue operations. In the late 20th century, the traditional industries of Wrexham, in particular coal-mining, went into decline. Llay Main closed in 1966, Hafod closed in 1968, Gresford Colliery closed in 1973, and Bersham Colliery closed in 1986.

=== Industrial estate ===

There are around 360 businesses in the estate, providing 10,000 jobs. The main industries operating in the industrial estate include: banking and finance, automotive, engineering, pharmaceutical, aerospace, and food and beverage. The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured at the Wockhardt UK facility in the industrial estate.

HM Prison Berwyn, a Category C adult-male prison is located in the industrial estate, and opened in 2017. It is the largest prison in the United Kingdom. In Chirk, there is a Kronospan wood product production factory and a Mondelez International (for Cadbury) factory.

<doc id="654565" wikidata="Q684958" url="?curid=654565" title="William de Longchamp">
<text>William de Longchamp (died 1197) was a medieval Lord Chancellor, Chief Justiciar, and Bishop of Ely in England. Born to a humble family in Normandy, he owed his advancement to royal favour. Although contemporary writers accused Longchamp&#x27;s father of being the son of a peasant, he held land as a knight. Longchamp first served Henry II&#x27;s illegitimate son Geoffrey, but quickly transferred to the service of Richard I, Henry&#x27;s heir. When Richard became king in 1189, Longchamp paid £3,000 for the office of Chancellor and was soon named to the Diocese, or bishopric, of Ely and appointed legate by the pope.

Longchamp governed England while Richard was on the Third Crusade, but his authority was challenged by Richard&#x27;s brother, John, who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England. Longchamp&#x27;s relations with the other leading English nobles were also strained, which contributed to the demands for his exile. Soon after Longchamp&#x27;s departure from England, Richard was captured on his journey back to England from the Crusade and held for ransom by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard&#x27;s release. Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard&#x27;s return to England, he lost much of his former power. He aroused a great deal of hostility among his contemporaries during his career, but he retained Richard&#x27;s trust and was employed by the king until the bishop&#x27;s death in 1197. Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law, which remained well-known throughout the Late Middle Ages.

== Background and early life ==
Longchamp&#x27;s ancestors originated in the village of Longchamps, Eure, Normandy. Although it is known that he was born in Normandy, the exact location is unknown, with it perhaps being near the Norman village of Argenton. His father, Hugh de Longchamp, also held land in England, as did many other Norman nobles after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Hugh Nonant — one of Longchamp&#x27;s opponents — declared that the elder Longchamp was the son of a peasant, which seems unlikely, as Hugh de Longchamp appears to have held a knight&#x27;s tenancy in Normandy. The family was originally of humble background but rose through service to King Henry II. The elder Longchamp also held land in Herefordshire in England, including the manor of Wilton near Ross in Wales. Hugh married a woman named Eve, a relative of the Lacy family. Historian David Balfour suggests that Eve was the daughter of Gilbert de Lacy, the son of Roger de Lacy, exiled by King William II in 1095 for rebellion.

Longchamp&#x27;s sister, Richeut, married the castellan of Dover Castle. A second sister, Melisend, came to England with Longchamp, but otherwise is unknown. A sister is recorded as having married Stephen Devereux, but whether this is Melisend is unclear. Of Longchamp&#x27;s brothers, Osbert remained a layman, and owed much of his advancement to William; Stephen served King Richard I on crusade; Henry, another layman, became a sheriff along with Osbert; and Robert became a monk. Two of Longchamp&#x27;s brothers became abbots.

Longchamp entered public life at the close of Henry II&#x27;s reign, as an official for the King&#x27;s illegitimate son Geoffrey. He soon left Geoffrey&#x27;s service, and served in Henry II&#x27;s chancery, or writing office, before he entered service with Henry&#x27;s son Richard. Richard, who was Duke of Aquitaine at the time, named Longchamp chancellor of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Longchamp first distinguished himself at the court of King Philip II of France in Paris in 1189, when he acted as Richard&#x27;s envoy in a dispute with William Marshal, King Henry&#x27;s envoy. By that time, Longchamp was already one of Richard&#x27;s trusted advisors.

== Chancellor and Justiciar ==
On Richard&#x27;s accession to the throne of England in 1189 Longchamp became Chancellor of England. Longchamp paid 3,000 pounds (£) for the office of Chancellor. This was followed by an increase in the price of having chancery documents sealed with the Great Seal, necessary for their authentication, perhaps to help Longchamp recoup the cost of the office. At the council held at Pipewell on 15 September 1189, the King raised Longchamp to the bishopric of Ely. Richard named three other bishops at the same time: Godfrey de Lucy to Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to London, and Hubert Walter to Salisbury. Longchamp was consecrated on 31 December 1189 and enthroned at Ely on 6 January 1190.

Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp&#x27;s hands and appointed him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, to the office of Chief Justiciar, at that time not strictly a judicial office. Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king&#x27;s authority when the king was outside the kingdom, able to act in the king&#x27;s name. Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshal as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historians&#x27; opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar&#x27;s office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500 marks (£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.

Longchamp granted the citizens of London the right to elect their own sheriffs, and to collect and remit their monetary levy of £300 directly to the Exchequer, the treasury of England. On Longchamp&#x27;s visits to his diocese he was accompanied by a large train of retainers and animals, which became notorious throughout the country as a sign of his extravagance. Under his legatine authority, the bishop held legatine councils of the church at Gloucester and Westminster in 1190. He also acted to restore authority in York, which had suffered a breakdown in order after the massacre of Jews in March 1190. Also in 1190, he sent an army against Rhys ap Gruffydd, a Welsh prince who was attempting to throw off the control of the marcher lords that surrounded Wales.

== Disputes with John ==
Longchamp&#x27;s relations with the English people were made more difficult because he was a native of Normandy, and often insensitive to English customs. The medieval writer William of Newburgh claimed that Longchamp was &quot;an obscure foreigner of unproven ability and loyalty&quot;. For example, it appears likely that Longchamp did not speak English, making his relations with his flock more difficult. The leading nobles complained that Longchamp marginalised the other officials Richard had appointed to serve with him and that he brought in foreigners to fill offices. Although the first charge is mostly untrue, the second appears to have been valid, as Longchamp did install non-natives in judicial offices and as sheriffs. He also attempted to seize control of several English castles by granting their custody to relatives and dependents.

Throughout 1190, Longchamp&#x27;s relations with Richard&#x27;s younger brother John were difficult. This led to Longchamp besieging Lincoln Castle because the castellan would not surrender the castle and allow himself to be replaced by Longchamp&#x27;s nominee. The castellan, Gerard de Camville, had sworn allegiance to John and stated he would no longer recognise the chancellor&#x27;s authority. In response, John took the two castles of Tickhill and Northampton. News of the dispute reached Richard, who sent Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, to England in late spring 1191, with orders to negotiate a peace between John and Longchamp. Eventually, Walter brokered a compromise between the two as a result of which Gerard was confirmed as castellan and John relinquished the castles. Longchamp also agreed to work to ensure John&#x27;s succession to the throne in the event of Richard&#x27;s death.

Longchamp&#x27;s legatine commission from the papacy expired in spring 1191, on the death of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp&#x27;s power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement&#x27;s successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II&#x27;s illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp&#x27;s subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp&#x27;s brother-in-law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop&#x27;s return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin&#x27;s Priory. Longchamp&#x27;s men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The violence of the attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket&#x27;s martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival.

An intense propaganda campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One of the leaders of the campaign against Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry, and he along with other magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, convened a trial on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, he was forced to surrender due to lack of support from the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.

Longchamp went to Dover in late 1191 to seek transport to the continent. During his escape, he was unable to answer the local people when they spoke to him in English. He attempted to leave England in various disguises, including a monk&#x27;s habit and women&#x27;s clothes. Hugh Nonant wrote that Longchamp attempted on one occasion to hide dressed as a prostitute, which led to him being assaulted by a fisherman who mistook him for a whore. Longchamp eventually succeeded in leaving England, on 29 October 1191.

== Exile and return ==
Longchamp went to the court of Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor, who was holding King Richard captive at Trifels. The bishop arranged for Richard to be held at the imperial court and negotiated a payment plan for the ransom, 100,000 marks, under the terms of which the emperor agreed to release Richard once 70,000 marks had been paid and hostages for the payment of the rest had been received. When the Emperor in January 1194 called a meeting of the imperial magnates to debate King Philip II of France&#x27;s offer to pay the Emperor to keep Richard captive, Longchamp attended along with Walter of Coutances and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard&#x27;s mother. After further diplomatic wrangling, Richard was freed on 4 February 1194.

Richard rewarded Longchamp with the custody of Eye, Suffolk and an appointment as Sheriff of Essex and Sheriff of Hertfordshire when the pair returned to England, but Longchamp soon became embroiled in a renewal of his disagreement with Archbishop Geoffrey of York. Richard left England in May 1194, and Longchamp accompanied him to the continent, never to return to England; Longchamp returned to the Emperor&#x27;s court in 1195. Richard continued to use Longchamp in diplomacy — although it was Geoffrey who arranged a truce with King Philip in 1194 — as well as retaining the bishop as chancellor, but the main power in England was now Hubert Walter. Longchamp spent the rest of his life outside his diocese, usually accompanying the king.

== Death and legacy ==
Longchamp died in January 1197, at Poitiers, while on a diplomatic mission to Rome for Richard, and was buried at the abbey of Le Pin. Much of the information on his career comes from people hostile to him, for example, Gerald of Wales called Longchamp that &quot;monster with many heads&quot;. The historian Austin Lane Poole says that Gerald described Longchamp as more like an ape than a man. Longchamp was reportedly a cultured and well-educated man. He was supported by others among his contemporaries, including Pope Clement III, who, when he appointed Longchamp legate, wrote that he did so at the urging of the English bishops. When he was one of four men named bishop in 1189, medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes wrote that the four new bishops were &quot;men of no little virtue and fame&quot;. Historian John Gillingham wrote that Longchamp&#x27;s &quot;record of his life in politics and administration was a good one, spoiled only by his failure in 1191&quot;.

Two writers have seen, in the assembly that met to try Longchamp in 1191, a precursor to the gathering at Runnymede in 1215 that drew up Magna Carta, as it was one of the earliest examples of the nobles of the realm coming together to force the government to rule with their advice. Longchamp also promoted the careers of his brothers; Henry and Osbert became sheriffs in the 1190s, Osbert the Sheriff of Yorkshire. His brother Robert, a cleric, also benefitted, becoming prior of the Ely cathedral chapter and later abbot of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York.

The medieval poet Nigel Wireker (also known as Nigel de Longchamps) dedicated to the bishop a satirical poem, &quot;Speculum Stultorum&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Fools&quot;), on the habits of students. Richard Barre, a medieval writer and judge, dedicated his work &quot;Compendium de veteris et novo testamento&quot; to Longchamp. Longchamp was one of Barre&#x27;s patrons, and secured the post of Archdeacon of Ely for him as well as judicial posts.

One of Longchamp&#x27;s probable innovations as chancellor was the replacement of the first person singular previously used in documents drafted in the king&#x27;s name with the majestic plural or &quot;royal we&quot;. He wrote a work on law entitled &quot;Practica legum et decretorum&quot;, a manual on the usage of both civil and canon law in the Angevin possessions on the continent, composed sometime between 1181 and 1189. It was well known in the Middle Ages and served as a practical guide for those involved in litigation.

Born to Italian and Swiss immigrant parents in Salt Lake City, Borzage began his career as a teenager performing with traveling theater groups throughout the western United States He found employment in Hollywood in 1912, where he began directing and acting in short films before transitioning to feature films. Borzage&#x27;s other directorial feature credits include &quot;Street Angel&quot; (1928), &quot;Bad Girl&quot; (1931), &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1932), &quot;Man&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1933), &quot;History Is Made at Night&quot; (1937), &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; (1940), and &quot;Moonrise&quot; (1948). 

His final credited directorial work is the historical drama &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot; (1959), before his death from cancer in 1962.

==Biography== 
Borzage was born Frank Borzaga in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1894, one of 14 children born to a Swiss mother, Maria (née Ruegg; 1860—1947), and an Italian father, Luigi Borzaga, a stonemason born in 1859 Ronzone (then Austrian Empire). Luigi and Maria met in her native Switzerland while she was employed in a silk factory. The couple emigrated to the United States in the early 1880s, settling in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, where Borzaga worked as a coal miner before the two married in 1883 and relocated to Wyoming before settling in Utah shortly before Frank&#x27;s birth. Borzage was one of 14 children, eight of whom survived childhood: Henry (1885–1971), Mary Emma (1886–1906), Bill (1892–1973), Frank, Daniel (1896–1975, a performer and member of the John Ford Stock Company), Lew (1898–1974), Dolly (1901–2002) and Sue (1905–1998). Although a Roman Catholic family, the Borzagas had a rapport with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and Luigi helped found several LDS temples. Luigi Borzaga died in Los Angeles in a car accident in 1934; his wife Maria (Frank&#x27;s mother) later died of cancer in 1947.

As a child, Borzage became interested in acting, and while a teenager, took a job mining silver near Park City to save funds to attend a drama school in Salt Lake City. Borzage performed in several traveling theater groups who staged plays throughout the Western United States, including in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Oregon. Around 1912, he joined the Gilmore Brown theater company, which led him to Los Angeles.

===Career===
In 1912, Borzage found employment as an actor in Hollywood; he continued to work as an actor until 1917. His directorial debut came in 1915 with the film &quot;The Pitch o&#x27; Chance&quot;. Borzage was a successful director throughout the 1920s; he reached his peak in the late silent and early sound era. Absorbing visual influences from the German director F. W. Murnau, who was also resident at Fox at this time, he developed his own style of lushly visual romanticism in a hugely successful series of films starring Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, including &quot;7th Heaven&quot; (1927), for which he won the first Academy Award for Best Director, &quot;Street Angel&quot; (1928) and &quot;Lucky Star&quot; (1929). He won a second Oscar for 1931&#x27;s &quot;Bad Girl&quot;.

He directed 14 films from 1917 to 1919 alone; his greatest success in the silent era was with &quot;Humoresque&quot; (1920), a box-office winner starring Vera Gordon.

Borzage&#x27;s trademark was intense identification with the feelings of young lovers in the face of adversity, with love in his films triumphing over such trials as World War I (&quot;7th Heaven&quot; and &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;), disability (&quot;Lucky Star&quot;), the Depression (&quot;Man&#x27;s Castle&quot;), a thinly disguised version of the Titanic disaster in &quot;History Is Made at Night&quot;, and the rise of Nazism, a theme which Borzage had virtually to himself among Hollywood filmmakers, including &quot;Little Man, What Now?&quot; (1933), &quot;Three Comrades&quot; (1938), and &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; (1940).

His work took a spiritual turn in films such as &quot;Green Light&quot; (1937), &quot;Strange Cargo&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot; (1959). Of his later work, only &quot;Moonrise&quot; (1948) has enjoyed much critical acclaim.

After 1948, his output was sporadic, but he directed three episodes of the Screen Directors Playhouse television series between 1955 and 1956.

In 1955 and 1957, Borzage was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.
For his contributions to the film industry, Borzage received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. The star is located at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard.

He was the original director of &quot;Journey Beneath the Desert&quot; (1961), but was too unwell to continue, and Edgar G. Ulmer took over. Borzage was uncredited for the sequences he did direct.

While hospitalized in February 1962, he received the D. W. Griffith Award.

He was an officer and board member of the Directors Guild of America.

==Personal life==
On June 7, 1916, Borzage married vaudeville and film actress Lorena &quot;Rena&quot; Rogers in Los Angeles and remained married until 1941. In 1945, he married Edna Stillwell Skelton, the ex-wife of comedian Red Skelton; they were divorced in 1949. His marriage to Juanita Scott in 1953 lasted till his death nine years later.

He was a keen sportsman, with a 3-goal polo handicap and a two handicap in golf, and a yachtsman.

==Death==
Borzage died in Los Angeles of cancer in 1962, aged 68, and he was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<doc id="654573" wikidata="Q697126" url="?curid=654573" title="Bridgend County Borough">
<text>Bridgend County Borough () is a county borough in the south-east of Wales. The county borough has a total population of 139,200 people, and contains the town of Bridgend, after which it is named. Its members of the Senedd are Sarah Murphy MS, representing the Bridgend Constituency, and Huw Irranca-Davies MS representing the Ogmore Constituency, and its members of the UK parliament are Chris Bryant, Chris Elmore, and Stephen Kinnock.

The county borough lies at the geographical heart of south Wales. Its land area of 110 mi2 (285 km2) stretches 12 miles (20 km) from east to west and occupies the Llynfi, Garw and Ogmore valleys. The largest town is Bridgend (pop: 39,773), followed by Maesteg (pop: 20,700) and Porthcawl (pop: 19,238). It is situated on the Ogmore River and its tributaries, although the Ewenny and Ogwr Fach rivers form the border with the Vale of Glamorgan for much of their length.

It was formed on 1 April 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994. It includes all of the former Ogwr borough apart from the communities of Wick, St Bride&#x27;s Major and Ewenny, which went to Vale of Glamorgan. Bridgend County Borough was divided into 20 communities: Brackla, Bridgend, Cefn Cribwr, Coity Higher, Coychurch Higher, Coychurch Lower, Cornelly, Garw Valley, Laleston, Llangynwyd Lower, Llangynwyd Middle, Maesteg, Merthyr Mawr, Newcastle Higher, Ogmore Valley, Pencoed, Porthcawl, Pyle, St Bride&#x27;s Minor and Ynysawdre. The communities of Brackla, Bridgend and Coychurch Lower make up the town of Bridgend.

==Government==
The region is governed by Bridgend County Borough Council, a principal council. It is currently in the control of the Labour party with 26 seats out of 54.

From 2024, Bridgend County Borough would be in three UK Parliament constituencies, Aberafan Maesteg, Bridgend, and Rhondda and Ogmore.

==Schools==
==Parks and green spaces==
Bryngarw Country Park is the largest (113 acres) country park in the borough. It offers many amenity based areas including an adventure play area, barbecue and picnic areas, car park, cafe, visitor centre and toilets; as well as a patchwork of woodland, grassland and freshwater habitats. Bryngarw Country Park is a Grade II listed Historic Park and Garden and has been designated a &#x27;Green Flag&#x27; Park since 2010. The Oriental Garden in the park has been noted as a &#x27;Visit Wales Sustainable Tourism, Historic Gardens Centre of Excellence&#x27; by the &#x27;One Historic Garden, Centre of Excellence&#x27;.

Kenfig National Nature Reserve with Glamorgan&#x27;s largest natural lake, Kenfig Pool, is set on the edge of this area, with views from Sker beach across Swansea Bay to Gower. It is one of the finest wildlife habitats in Wales, and one of the last remnants of a huge dune system that once stretched along the coast from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula. The reserve is home to unique wild orchids, as well as insects and wildlife. Kenfig is one of the most important sites in Britain for nature conservation.

Parc Slip Nature Reserve is an environment of wetlands, woodlands and meadows at the Parc Slip Nature Park where there is a wealth of wildlife. After a century of coal mining on the site, the Wildlife Trust began to manage the land for nature in the late 1980s. Varied habitats have since been created and the park supports an increasing diversity of wildlife.

<text>This is a list of notable companies based in Ireland, or subsidiaries according to their sector. It includes companies from the entire island. The state of the Republic of Ireland covers five-sixths of the island, with Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, covering the remainder in the north-east. Each has separate regulatory and registration authorities.

==About companies in Ireland==
Irish companies fall into three categories:

* Private limited companies, which carry the suffix &quot;Limited&quot; (Ltd) or &quot;Teoranta&quot; (Teo), and whose shares are privately held.
* Public limited companies, which carry the suffix &quot;plc&quot; or &quot;&quot; and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange. Where this is the case, it is noted in this article.
* Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies.

Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the Companies Registration Office, and comply with the provisions of the &quot;Companies Acts&quot;. Companies in Northern Ireland must be registered with the Department for the Economy&#x27;s Companies Registry. Certain Northern Ireland organisations are dealt with on a UK-wide basis and are dealt with by Companies House.

Some entries on this list may be &quot;statutory corporations&quot; - a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under a particular piece of legislation - not formally companies as such, but are effectively treated as such and are included on this list as they are usually large business. For more details on this form of governance, see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland.

Some mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included on this list.

Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies. These subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies in comparison to other nations and these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people.

== Largest firms ==

This list shows firms in the Fortune Global 500, which ranks firms by total revenues reported before 31 March 2017. Only the top five firms (if available) are included as a sample.

== Notable firms ==
This list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.

Jonathan Arnold was born in Gloucester, Rhode Island on December 3, 1741 (Old Style December 14), the son of Josiah Arnold and Amy (Phillips) Arnold. He trained for a career in medicine and practiced as a physician in Providence. In 1774, he became a charter member of the Providence Grenadiers militia unit, and until 1776 he commanded a company with the rank of captain. In 1776, Arnold was elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly, where he authored the May Act that repealed the requirement for government officials and militia officers to swear an oath of allegiance to England.

At the start of the American Revolution, Arnold joined the Continental Army as a surgeon. During the war, he was head of the military hospital in Providence. He was elected as a Delegate to the Congress of the Confederation in 1782, and served until 1783. While he was a member of Congress, the body voted in secret to arrest Luke Knowlton and Samuel Wells of Brattleboro in the Vermont Republic on suspicion of communicating with the British in Canada. They fled before they could be detained, but returned to Brattleboro after the end of the Revolution. Arnold was accused of warning Knowlton and Wells prior to their arrests, which he denied, but fellow members of Congress including James Madison did not believe his denial.

==Later life==

In 1786, Arnold moved to Winchester, New Hampshire, where he continued to practice medicine. He subsequently became proprietor and the first settler of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, and served as St. Johnsbury&#x27;s first town clerk. While living in Vermont, Arnold also obtained charters for the towns of Bestbury (now Lyndon), Burke, and Billymead (now Sutton).

After settling in Vermont, Arnold served on the governor&#x27;s council from 1790 to 1793. He was a judge of the Orange County court beginning in 1792, and he remained on the bench until his death. While living in Rhode Island, Arnold&#x27;s family had been given a slave, Ruth Farrow, as a gift. Arnold was a member of the Providence Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery, and freed Farrow, who continued to live with and work for members of the Arnold family until her death in 1841.

==Death and burial==
Arnold died in St. Johnsbury on February 1, 1793. He was initially buried in the Arnold family plot in the town cemetery. When the cemetery&#x27;s land was appropriated for a courthouse in 1856, Arnold was reburied at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in St. Johnsbury. Arnold Park in St. Johnsbury is located near the site of Arnold&#x27;s former home, and is named for him.

==Family==
In 1763, Arnold married Marry Burr (1743–1781). His second wife was Alice Crawford (1757–1790), whom he married in 1782. After the death of his second wife, in 1792 Arnold married Cynthia Hastings Ladd (1763–1838).

Arnold was the father of 11 children:

*Amy Arnold Deuel (1764–1843)
*Amaziah Arnold (1766–1767)
*Josias Lyndon Arnold (1768–1796)
*Polly Burr Arnold (1770–1772)
*William C. Arnold (1773–1813)
*Sarah (Sally) Arnold Burrill (1777–1814)
*Abigail Arnold Dow (1780–1824)
*John Crawford Arnold (1784–1784)
*Freelove Crawford Arnold (1788–1789)
*Freelove Crawford Arnold Davis (1790–1848)
*Lemuel Hastings Arnold (1792–1852)

Arnold&#x27;s son Lemuel Hastings Arnold served in the United States House of Representatives and as Governor of Rhode Island. His grandson Noah Davis served in the United States House of Representatives. His grandson Richard Arnold was a career officer in the United States Army who served as a brigadier general of volunteers in the Union Army during the American Civil War and attained the rank of major general of both volunteers and the regular army by brevet. His great-great-grandson Theodore Francis Green served as Rhode Island&#x27;s governor and as a United States Senator.

<text>The Treaty of Stolbovo (; ) was a peace treaty that ended the Ingrian War (), which had been fought between the Swedish Empire and the Russian Tsardom between 1610 and 1617.

==History==
After nearly two months of negotiations, representatives from Sweden and Russia met at the now-derelict village of Stolbovo, south of Lake Ladoga, now in Volkhovsky District. The meeting took place on .
From the outset, Sweden had gone into the negotiations with very high ambitions and hopes of fulfilling the old dream of making all Russian trade pass through Swedish territory. As a consequence of that ambition, the Swedes originally demanded far-reaching territorial gains into western Russia, including the important northern port of Arkhangelsk.

However, King James I of England sent a delegation to mediate, and the United Provinces did the same, mostly to ensure that Arkhangelsk did not fall into Swedish hands, which would have made the extensive trade between Western Europe and Russia far more difficult. Arkhangelsk did not change hands in the resulting treaty, partly because of the Dutch and the English efforts but mostly because Russia finally managed to unite under Tsar Michael I of Russia. As word reached Russia that the Swedish war against Poland might soon be over, the Russians really became serious in the negotiations to avoid Sweden&#x27;s renewal of the war effort on only one front.

The Kingdom of England was officially credited with brokering the peace through its mediator, John Mericke (c.1559 – 1638/9), but the Dutch efforts were also very important. After the war, the leader of the Dutch delegation, Reinoud van Brederode (1567–1633), was granted the title of baron and given the barony of Wesenberg (Rakvere) in Estonia by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.

==Terms==
In the resulting peace treaty, the Russian tsar and Swedish king agreed to the following terms:

* Sweden gained the province of Kexholm in Karelia and the province of Ingria – including the fortress of Nöteborg, (now Shlisselburg, Russia).
* Russia renounced all claims to Estonia and Livonia and would pay Sweden war indemnities of 20,000 rubles.
* Novgorod and other Swedish territorial gains during the war would be returned to Russia.
* Sweden had the right to keep all spoils of war collected before 20 November 1616.
* The city of Gdov was to remain in Swedish hands until the peace had been confirmed and the borders fully established.
* Sweden recognised Michael Romanov as the rightful Russian tsar and ended further Swedish claims in the Russian throne.
* Russia was allowed free trade at normal trade tariffs, which ensured that Sweden would not completely cripple Russia.
* Russia was allowed to establish merchant houses in Stockholm, Reval (Tallinn) and Viborg, and Sweden was allowed to establish merchant houses in Novgorod, Pskov and Moscow.

<text>Caerphilly County Borough () is a county borough in the south-east of Wales. It is governed by Caerphilly County Borough Council.

Its main and largest town is Caerphilly. Other towns in the county borough are, Risca, Ystrad Mynach, Newbridge, Blackwood, Bargoed, New Tredegar and Rhymney.

==Geography==
Caerphilly County Borough is in southeast Wales and straddles the border between the historic counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. It is bordered by Cardiff to the southwest, Newport to the southeast, Torfaen to the east, Blaenau Gwent to the northeast, Powys to the north, Merthyr Tydfil to the northwest and Rhondda Cynon Taf to the west.

The northern part of the borough is formed by the broad expanse of the Rhymney Valley. The Rhymney River rises in the hills in the north and flows southwards for about thirty miles, looping round to the east just to the north of Caerphilly before reaching the Bristol Channel. Some of the larger towns are Bedwas, Risca, Ystrad Mynach, Newbridge, Blackwood, Bargoed, New Tredegar and Rhymney. The valley also includes the communities of Abertysswg, Fochriw, Pontlottyn, Tir-Phil, Brithdir, New Tredegar, Aberbargoed, Rhymney and Ystrad Mynach, and the towns of Bargoed and Caerphilly.

==History==
Located on the edge of the South Wales Coalfield this area was sparsely populated with livestock husbandry being the main occupation. Farmers in their remote farmhouses on the windswept pastures might dig themselves some bucketfuls of coal for their hearth. Things began to change with the development of the iron industry, the start of the Industrial Revolution. In 1752, a 99-year lease was granted for a parcel of land in the Rhymney Valley which gave the lessees the right to mine coal and iron ore. Other such transactions followed, pit shafts were dug and the coal industry developed. By the beginning of the twentieth century, there were forty coalmines in the valley.

One of the pits sunk in the late nineteenth century was the Elliot Colliery. At its peak before World War I, it was producing over a million tons of coal a year and employing nearly three thousand people. The coal eventually became depleted and the colliery closed in 1967. Most of the site was cleared but the East Winding House survives and is now a Grade II listed building, and a museum of the coal industry in the area has been opened on the site. All the pits in the valley were closed by the end of the twentieth century; the spoil heaps were removed and the area was landscaped so that it is not now apparent that the valley ever had an industrial past.

The county borough was formed on 1 April 1996 by the merger of the Rhymney Valley district of Mid Glamorgan with the Islwyn borough of Gwent. In 2008, as a result of representations from different communities in the borough, a draft plan was put forward proposing various changes to the borders between communities.

<text>Conwy (, ), previously known in English as Conway, is a walled market town, community and the administrative centre of Conwy County Borough in North Wales. The walled town and castle stand on the west bank of the River Conwy, facing Deganwy on the east bank. The town formerly lay in Gwynedd and prior to that in Caernarfonshire. The community, which also includes Deganwy and Llandudno Junction, had a population of 14,753 at the 2011 census.

Postal addresses do not follow the community boundaries. On the east bank of the river, Deganwy forms part of the Conwy post town, but Llandudno Junction is a separate post town. The ward on the west bank of the river had a population of 4,065 at the 2011 census.

The resident population of the wider Conwy County Borough was estimated to be 116,200 in an ONS-estimate.

The name &#x27;Conwy&#x27; derives from the old Welsh words &quot;cyn&quot; (chief) and &quot;gwy&quot; (water), the river being originally called the &#x27;Cynwy&#x27;.

==History==
===Castle and town walls===
Conwy Castle and the town walls were built, on the instructions of Edward I of England, between 1283 and 1289, as part of his conquest of the principality of Wales. The church standing in Conwy has been marked as the oldest building in Conwy and has stood in the walls of Conwy since the 14th century. However, the oldest structure is part of the town walls, at the southern end of the east side. Here one wall and the tower of a &quot;llys&quot; (palace/court house) belonging to Llywelyn the Great and his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffydd have been incorporated into the wall. Built on a rocky outcrop, it has a prominent apsidal tower.

The walls are part of a World Heritage Site, Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd.

People born within the town walls of Conwy are nicknamed &quot;Jackdaws&quot;, after the jackdaws which live on the walls there. A Jackdaw Society existed until 2011.

The population of the town in 1841 was 1,358.

===Abbey===
Conwy was the original site of Aberconwy Abbey, founded by Llywelyn the Great. Edward and his troops took over the abbey site and moved the monks up the Conwy valley to a new site at Maenan, establishing Maenan Abbey. The parish church St Mary &amp; All Saints still retains some parts of the original abbey church in the east and west walls.

===Suspension bridge===
Conwy has other tourist attractions. Conwy Suspension Bridge, designed by Thomas Telford to replace the ferry, was completed in 1826 and spans the River Conwy next to the castle. Telford designed the bridge&#x27;s supporting towers to match the castle&#x27;s turrets. The bridge is now open to pedestrians only and, together with the toll-keeper&#x27;s house, is in the care of the National Trust.

===Railway bridge===
The Conwy Railway Bridge, a tubular bridge, was built for the Chester and Holyhead Railway by Robert Stephenson. The first tube was completed in 1848, the second in 1849. The bridge is still in use on the North Wales Coast Line, along with the station, which is located within the town walls. In addition to a modern bridge serving the town, the A55 road passes under the river in a tunnel, Britain&#x27;s first immersed tube tunnel, which was built between 1986 and 1991. The old mountain road to Dwygyfylchi and Penmaenmawr runs through the Sychnant Pass, at the foot of Conwy Mountain.

===Aberconwy House===
The National Trust owns Aberconwy House, which is Conwy&#x27;s only surviving 14th-century merchant&#x27;s house, one of the first buildings built inside the walls of Conwy.

=== Plas Mawr ===

Plas Mawr is an Elizabethan house built in 1576 by the Wynn family, which has been extensively refurbished to its 16th-century appearance and is now in the care of Cadw and open to the public.

===Smallest house in Great Britain===
The house named in the Guinness Book of Records as the Smallest House in Great Britain, with dimensions of 3.05 × 1.8 metres, can be found on the quay. It was in continuous occupation from the 16th century (and was even inhabited by a family at one point) until 1900 when the owner (a fisherman – Robert Jones) was forced to move out on the grounds of hygiene. The rooms were too small for him to stand up in fully. The house is still owned by his descendants today, and visitors can look around it for a small charge.

=== Vardre Hall ===
Vardre Hall is a 19th-century Grade II listed building directly opposite to Conwy Castle. It was erected by Conservative Buckinghamshire MP William Edward FitzMaurice in the mid 1850s. In 1869 the building was sold to solicitor William Jones. The building was used as a solicitor&#x27;s office until 1972, when it was bought out and became The Towers Restaurant. After lying empty for a number of years Vardre Hall changed hands again, and in 1999 was refurbished as a shop.

===Medieval watchtower===
Across the estuary is Bodysgallen Hall, which incorporates a medieval tower that was possibly built as a watch tower for Conwy Castle.

==Notable locations==
Conwy Morfa, a marshy spit of land on the west side of the estuary, was probably the location where golf was first played on Welsh soil. It was also the place where Hugh Iorys Hughes developed, and later built, the floating Mulberry Harbour, used in Operation Overlord in World War II.

Conwy Hospital closed in 2003 and has since been demolished.

==Transport==
Conwy railway station opened in 1848. It is located on the North Wales Coast Line, between Crewe and Holyhead. There are through services westbound to Bangor and Holyhead. Eastwards, services travel to Chester, via Colwyn Bay, Rhyl, Prestatyn and Flint; after arrival at Chester, most trains go forward to either Crewe, Cardiff or Birmingham International. Services are operated by Transport for Wales.

Bus services in Conwy are operated mostly by Arriva Wales, with some by Llew Jones Coaches. Routes link the town with Bangor, Caernarfon and Llandudno.

==Lifeboat==
A lifeboat station was established by the RNLI in 1966 and currently operates the D-class inshore lifeboat, the &quot;May-Bob&quot;, (D–765).

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Conwy, at community (town) and county borough level: Conwy Town Council (Cyngor Tref Conwy) and Conwy County Borough Council. The town council is based at Conwy Guildhall on Rose Hill Street.

===Administrative history===
Conwy was an ancient parish and an ancient borough, having been given a charter by Edward I of England in 1284. The borough covered a larger area than the parish, also including the Deganwy area in the parish of Eglwys Rhos on the east bank of the river, and parts of the parishes of Gyffin, Llangelynnin, and Dwygyfylchi west of the river.

Unlike most such boroughs, it was not reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and so the old borough corporation continued to exist and run the town. By 1876 the borough corporation was seen as an archaic and unaccountable impediment to the proper management of the town. The town&#x27;s residents organised a petition to convert the town into a municipal borough with an elected corporation to take responsibility for public health and local government. A royal charter incorporating the town as a municipal borough was issued in December 1876, and the new borough corporation took over the running of the town from March 1877. The urban parishes within the borough boundary were reorganised in 1894 to comprise Conwy and Gyffin on the west bank and Llanrhos on the east bank.

In 1972 the borough council voted to change the spelling of the town&#x27;s name from &quot;Conway&quot; to &quot;Conwy&quot;. The change was agreed by the Secretary of State for Wales and took effect on 1 August 1972. The municipal borough was abolished in 1974, with the area becoming part of the Aberconwy district in the new county of Gwynedd. A community called Conwy was established at the same time covering the area of the former borough. Further local government reorganisation in 1996 saw Aberconwy abolished and the town transferred to the new Conwy County Borough, named after the town but covering a much larger area.

<doc id="654601" wikidata="Q849375" url="?curid=654601" title="Tridecagon">
<text>In geometry, a tridecagon or triskaidecagon or 13-gon is a thirteen-sided polygon.

==Regular tridecagon==

A &quot;regular tridecagon&quot; is represented by Schläfli symbol {13}.

The measure of each internal angle of a regular tridecagon is approximately 152.308 degrees, and the area with side length &quot;a&quot; is given by
:formula_1

==Construction==
As 13 is a Pierpont prime but not a Fermat prime, the regular tridecagon cannot be constructed using a compass and straightedge. However, it is constructible using neusis, or an angle trisector.

The following is an animation from a &quot;neusis construction&quot; of a regular tridecagon with radius of circumcircle formula_2 according to Andrew M. Gleason, based on the angle trisection by means of the Tomahawk (light blue).

An approximate construction of a regular tridecagon using straightedge and compass is shown here.


Another possible animation of an approximate construction, also possible with using straightedge and compass.

===Based on the unit circle r = 1 [unit of length]===
* Constructed side length in GeoGebra formula_3
* Side length of the tridecagon formula_4
* Absolute error of the constructed side length:
: Up to the maximum precision of 15 decimal places, the absolute error is formula_5
* Constructed central angle of the tridecagon in GeoGebra (display significant 13 decimal places, rounded) formula_6
* Central angle of tridecagon formula_7
* Absolute angular error of the constructed central angle:
: Up to 13 decimal places, the absolute error is formula_8

===Example to illustrate the error===
At a circumscribed circle of radius r = 1 billion km (a distance which would take light approximately 55 minutes to travel), the absolute error on the side length constructed would be less than 1 mm.
== Symmetry==
The &quot;regular tridecagon&quot; has Dih13 symmetry, order 26. Since 13 is a prime number there is one subgroup with dihedral symmetry: Dih1, and 2 cyclic group symmetries: Z13, and Z1.

These 4 symmetries can be seen in 4 distinct symmetries on the tridecagon. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r26 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g13 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.

==Numismatic use==
The regular tridecagon is used as the shape of the Czech 20 korun coin.

==Related polygons==
A tridecagram is a 13-sided star polygon. There are 5 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols: {13/2}, {13/3}, {13/4}, {13/5}, and {13/6}. Since 13 is prime, none of the tridecagrams are compound figures. Culturally, this shape is a symbol for immortality.

<text>The National Aquatic Centre (NAC) () is an indoor aquatics facility in Blanchardstown, Fingal, Ireland. The State-owned complex houses a 50-metre swimming pool with an associated diving pool, an aquapark and leisure pool, and a fitness centre.

Since opening in March 2003, the centre has hosted the swimming events of the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games, the 2003 European Short Course Swimming Championships and a number of international water polo events. It also hosts the Irish Open Swimming Championships, Irish Senior Water Polo Cup, and Irish Open Diving Championships, as well as a number of other national and regional aquatic events.

==History==
In 2001, a &quot;Design, Build and Operate&quot; contract for the centre was awarded to a consortium of companies – S &amp; P Architects (for the design part), Rohcon (construction) and Dublin Waterworld (operation). The capital cost of the centre was originally budgeted at €62.5 million. The project was certified as complete in September 2010. The actual cost of the project is still unclear but, as of 2013, €119m had been spent on the campus.

The centre sustained roof damage during a period of stormy weather in January 2005 and had to be closed for five months so that repairs could be carried out. This closure, after only 18 months of operation, damaged the business of the operating company, Dublin Waterworld. Campus &amp; Stadium Ireland Development (CSID), the State company which owns the centre, commissioned an engineer to assess the roof damage and they concluded that the roof was not designed and constructed in accordance with building regulations, despite the fact that CSID&#x27;s experts had certified it. During the period of closure, the National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA) commenced legal proceedings to remove the operators. The case was settled in December 2006 with Dublin Waterworld agreeing to leave the centre and each party covering their own costs.

NSCDA stated that the former Operator Dublin Waterworld Limited had failed to pay VAT of some €10m. A High Court-appointed arbitrator upheld the VAT charge as did the High Court. However, in 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that there was no basis for the VAT charge and set aside both the earlier awards. The Public Accounts Committee investigated the background of the case and issued a report in May 2012, which was highly critical of NSCDA and the Department of Sport. In December 2012, Dublin Waterworld acquired documents that demonstrated that NSCDA had been advised in 2002 that the VAT charge was contrary to legislation. These documents were forwarded to the Public Accounts Committee, and an explanation from NSCDA was sought.

From the time when the NSCDA took back the running of the centre in 2007 until 2013, the centre saw visitor numbers multiply, and membership triple, but it still required a multi-million euro annual subsidy. The centre&#x27;s operators stated that the centre had over six hundred thousand visitors in 2011, with admission income of €1.4m and ticket costs of up to €14. In 2012 over 815,000 people used the facilities of the centre, making it Ireland&#x27;s third most popular fee-paying attraction.

Swim Ireland launched a High Performance Unit in April 2010 and conducts training camps for elite swimmers at the centre. In 2012, the NAC hosted pre-Olympic training camps for teams from 16 different countries, including the then Water Polo Champions Hungary, the new Olympic Water Polo Champions Croatia, the Korean National Swimming team and the Synchronised Swimming team from the US, among others.

The NAC has come to house Ireland&#x27;s biggest one-site programme of swimming lessons (over 2,500 participants weekly) and has over 4,500 members. On 7 January 2013 the centre set an Irish record for the most bookings in one day for swimming, diving and synchronised swimming lessons.

==Facilities==
The National Aquatic Centre is one of the world&#x27;s largest indoor water centres. It comprises:
* a 10-lane 50-metre x 25-metre international-standard swimming pool with two moveable floors which allow it to be reconfigured for other uses;
* a 25-metre international standard diving and warm-up pool;
* seating for 2,500 spectators;
* a leisure area (AquaZone) including adventure water rides, with a children&#x27;s play pool and wave pool, and a &quot;lazy river&quot; feature;
* a fitness centre (ToneZone);
* a café.

The centre is fully accessible and was commended in 6 O2 Kanchi Award categories as well as winning ILAM Gold Standard awards twice.
In November 2012 the centre won the Fingal Business Chamber Award for &quot;Best Sales &amp; Marketing&quot;. This added to the Dublin 15 Chamber Awards won in 2009 &amp; 2010.

===Olympic-standard swimming pool===
The National Aquatic Centre houses Ireland&#x27;s first Olympic standard pool. Known as the International Competition Pool, in 2003 it was used for the 2003 Special Olympics and later in the same year hosted the Ligue européenne de natation. In 2012, this pool hosted nations from across the globe, including teams from the USA, Great Britain, South Korea, Canada, Croatia and more for pre-London Olympic Games training camps.

===Aquazone Waterpark===
Aquazone is the name of a water park which operates in the National Aquatic Centre. The water park features three water slides (The Dark Hole, The Green Giant and the Master Blaster), a surfing machine, a lazy river and a large pool that generates waves.

<text>Lochans is a small village around south of Stranraer, in Dumfries and Galloway in south-west Scotland. In 1971 it had a population of 355.

== Areas of historic significance ==
In the 19th century, Lochans Mill was a small two-storey range. The walls are made with stone rubble and the mill roofed with slate. In the late 1700s, this building was built as meal mill. The wheel at the side is made from cast iron and has six spokes mounted on a cast-iron axle; it is 3.66 m (12 ft) in diameter by 1.37m (4 ft) wide. Everything inside the mill has been removed, so there is no machinery. &quot;Lochan&quot; is the Gaelic word for a small loch.

==Glaciology==
Lochans are also used by a variety of scientists in the field of glaciology. Lochans are simply lakes, ponds or small concentrated rivers which are located on high rise glaciers or in open-wide plains. Not to be confused by tarns, kettle ponds, or truncated spurs, lochans are much more concentrated and use up a smaller area.

<text>LLVM, also called LLVM Core, is a target-independent optimizer and code generator. It can be used to develop a frontend for any programming language and a backend for any instruction set architecture. LLVM is designed around a language-independent intermediate representation (IR) that serves as a portable, high-level assembly language that can be optimized with a variety of transformations over multiple passes. The name &quot;LLVM&quot; originally stood for &quot;Low Level Virtual Machine.&quot; However, the project has since expanded, and the name is no longer an acronym but an orphan initialism.

LLVM is written in C++ and is designed for compile-time, link-time, runtime, and &quot;idle-time&quot; optimization. Originally implemented for C and C++, the language-agnostic design of LLVM has since spawned a wide variety of frontends: languages with compilers that use LLVM (or which do not directly use LLVM but can generate compiled programs as LLVM IR) include ActionScript, Ada, C# for .NET, Common Lisp, PicoLisp, Crystal, CUDA, D, Delphi, Dylan, Forth, Fortran, FreeBASIC, Free Pascal, Halide, Haskell, Idris, Jai (only for optimized release builds), Java bytecode, Julia, Kotlin, LabVIEW&#x27;s G language, Objective-C, OpenCL, PostgreSQL&#x27;s SQL and PLpgSQL, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Standard ML, Swift, Xojo, and Zig.

==History==
The LLVM project started in 2000 at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, under the direction of Vikram Adve and Chris Lattner. LLVM was originally developed as a research infrastructure to investigate dynamic compilation techniques for static and dynamic programming languages. LLVM was released under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, a permissive free software licence. In 2005, Apple Inc. hired Lattner and formed a team to work on the LLVM system for various uses within Apple&#x27;s development systems. LLVM has been an integral part of Apple&#x27;s Xcode development tools for macOS and iOS since Xcode 4 in 2011.

In 2006, Lattner started working on a new project named Clang. The combination of the Clang frontend and LLVM backend is named Clang/LLVM or simply Clang. 

The name &quot;LLVM&quot; was originally an initialism for &quot;Low Level Virtual Machine&quot;. However, the LLVM project evolved into an umbrella project that has little relationship to what most current developers think of as a virtual machine. This made the initialism &quot;confusing&quot; and &quot;inappropriate&quot;, and since 2011 LLVM is &quot;officially no longer an acronym&quot;, but a brand that applies to the LLVM umbrella project. The project encompasses the LLVM intermediate representation (IR), the LLVM debugger, the LLVM implementation of the C++ Standard Library (with full support of C++11 and C++14), etc. LLVM is administered by the LLVM Foundation. Compiler engineer Tanya Lattner became its president in 2014 and was in post .

&quot;For designing and implementing LLVM&quot;, the Association for Computing Machinery presented Vikram Adve, Chris Lattner, and Evan Cheng with the 2012 ACM Software System Award.

The project was originally available under the UIUC license. After v9.0.0 released in 2019, LLVM relicensed to the Apache License 2.0 with LLVM Exceptions. about 400 contributions had not been relicensed.

==Features==
LLVM can provide the middle layers of a complete compiler system, taking intermediate representation (IR) code from a compiler and emitting an optimized IR. This new IR can then be converted and linked into machine-dependent assembly language code for a target platform. LLVM can accept the IR from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) toolchain, allowing it to be used with a wide array of extant compiler front-ends written for that project. LLVM can also be built with gcc after version 7.5.

LLVM can also generate relocatable machine code at compile-time or link-time or even binary machine code at runtime.

LLVM supports a language-independent instruction set and type system. Each instruction is in static single assignment form (SSA), meaning that each variable (called a typed register) is assigned once and then frozen. This helps simplify the analysis of dependencies among variables. LLVM allows code to be compiled statically, as it is under the traditional GCC system, or left for late-compiling from the IR to machine code via just-in-time compilation (JIT), similar to Java. The type system consists of basic types such as integer or floating-point numbers and five derived types: pointers, arrays, vectors, structures, and functions. A type construct in a concrete language can be represented by combining these basic types in LLVM. For example, a class in C++ can be represented by a mix of structures, functions and arrays of function pointers.

The LLVM JIT compiler can optimize unneeded static branches out of a program at runtime, and thus is useful for partial evaluation in cases where a program has many options, most of which can easily be determined unneeded in a specific environment. This feature is used in the OpenGL pipeline of Mac OS X Leopard (v10.5) to provide support for missing hardware features.

Graphics code within the OpenGL stack can be left in intermediate representation and then compiled when run on the target machine. On systems with high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), the resulting code remains quite thin, passing the instructions on to the GPU with minimal changes. On systems with low-end GPUs, LLVM will compile optional procedures that run on the local central processing unit (CPU) that emulate instructions that the GPU cannot run internally. LLVM improved performance on low-end machines using Intel GMA chipsets. A similar system was developed under the Gallium3D LLVMpipe, and incorporated into the GNOME shell to allow it to run without a proper 3D hardware driver loaded.

In 2011, programs compiled by GCC outperformed those from LLVM by 10%, on average.
In 2013, phoronix reported that LLVM had caught up with GCC, compiling binaries of approximately equal performance.

==Components==
LLVM has become an umbrella project containing multiple components.

===Frontends===
LLVM was originally written to be a replacement for the extant code generator in the GCC stack, and many of the GCC frontends have been modified to work with it, resulting in the now-defunct LLVM-GCC suite. The modifications generally involve a GIMPLE-to-LLVM IR step so that LLVM optimizers and codegen can be used instead of GCC&#x27;s GIMPLE system. Apple was a significant user of LLVM-GCC through Xcode 4.x (2013). This use of the GCC frontend was considered mostly a temporary measure, but with the advent of Clang and advantages of LLVM and Clang&#x27;s modern and modular codebase (as well as compilation speed), is mostly obsolete.

LLVM currently supports compiling of Ada, C, C++, D, Delphi, Fortran, Haskell, Julia, Objective-C, Rust, and Swift using various frontends.

Widespread interest in LLVM has led to several efforts to develop new frontends for many languages. The one that has received the most attention is Clang, a newer compiler supporting C, C++, and Objective-C. Primarily supported by Apple, Clang is aimed at replacing the C/Objective-C compiler in the GCC system with a system that is more easily integrated with integrated development environments (IDEs) and has wider support for multithreading. Support for OpenMP directives has been included in Clang since release 3.8.

The Utrecht Haskell compiler can generate code for LLVM. While the generator was in early stages of development, in many cases it was more efficient than the C code generator. The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) backend uses LLVM and achieves a 30% speed-up of compiled code relative to native code compiling via GHC or C code generation followed by compiling, missing only one of the many optimizing techniques implemented by the GHC.

Many other components are in various stages of development, including, but not limited to, the Rust compiler, a Java bytecode frontend, a Common Intermediate Language (CIL) frontend, the MacRuby implementation of Ruby 1.9, various frontends for Standard ML, and a new graph coloring register allocator.

===Intermediate representation===
The core of LLVM is the intermediate representation (IR), a low-level programming language similar to assembly. IR is a strongly typed reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set which abstracts away most details of the target. For example, the calling convention is abstracted through codice_1 and codice_2 instructions with explicit arguments. Also, instead of a fixed set of registers, IR uses an infinite set of temporaries of the form %0, %1, etc. LLVM supports three equivalent forms of IR: a human-readable assembly format, an in-memory format suitable for frontends, and a dense bitcode format for serializing. A simple &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program in the human-readable IR format:
@.str = internal constant [14 x i8] c&quot;Hello, world\0A\00&quot;

declare i32 @printf(ptr, ...)

define i32 @main(i32 %argc, ptr %argv) nounwind {
entry:
 %tmp1 = getelementptr [14 x i8], ptr @.str, i32 0, i32 0
 %tmp2 = call i32 (ptr, ...) @printf( ptr %tmp1 ) nounwind
 ret i32 0


The many different conventions used and features provided by different targets mean that LLVM cannot truly produce a target-independent IR and retarget it without breaking some established rules. Examples of target dependence beyond what is explicitly mentioned in the documentation can be found in a 2011 proposal for &quot;wordcode&quot;, a fully target-independent variant of LLVM IR intended for online distribution. A more practical example is PNaCl.

The LLVM project also introduces another type of intermediate representation named MLIR which helps build reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure by employing a plugin architecture named Dialect. It enables the use of higher-level information on the program structure in the process of optimization including polyhedral compilation.

===Backends===
At version 16, LLVM supports many instruction sets, including IA-32, x86-64, ARM, Qualcomm Hexagon, LoongArch, M68K, MIPS, NVIDIA Parallel Thread Execution (PTX, also named &quot;NVPTX&quot; in LLVM documentation), PowerPC, AMD TeraScale, most recent AMD GPUs (also named &quot;AMDGPU&quot; in LLVM documentation), SPARC, z/Architecture (also named &quot;SystemZ&quot; in LLVM documentation), and XCore. 

Some features are not available on some platforms. Most features are present for IA-32, x86-64, z/Architecture, ARM, and PowerPC. RISC-V is supported as of version 7. 

In the past, LLVM also supported other backends, fully or partially, including C backend, Cell SPU, mblaze (MicroBlaze), AMD R600, DEC/Compaq Alpha (Alpha AXP) and Nios2, but that hardware is mostly obsolete, and LLVM developers decided the support and maintenance costs were no longer justified.

LLVM also supports WebAssembly as a target, enabling compiled programs to execute in WebAssembly-enabled environments such as Google Chrome / Chromium, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari or WAVM. LLVM-compliant WebAssembly compilers typically support mostly unmodified source code written in C, C++, D, Rust, Nim, Kotlin and several other languages.

The LLVM machine code (MC) subproject is LLVM&#x27;s framework for translating machine instructions between textual forms and machine code. Formerly, LLVM relied on the system assembler, or one provided by a toolchain, to translate assembly into machine code. LLVM MC&#x27;s integrated assembler supports most LLVM targets, including IA-32, x86-64, ARM, and ARM64. For some targets, including the various MIPS instruction sets, integrated assembly support is usable but still in the beta stage.

===Linker===
The lld subproject is an attempt to develop a built-in, platform-independent linker for LLVM. lld aims to remove dependence on a third-party linker. , lld supports ELF, PE/COFF, Mach-O, and WebAssembly in descending order of completeness. lld is faster than both flavors of GNU ld.

Unlike the GNU linkers, lld has built-in support for link-time optimization (LTO). This allows for faster code generation as it bypasses the use of a linker plugin, but on the other hand prohibits interoperability with other flavors of LTO.

===C++ Standard Library===
The LLVM project includes an implementation of the C++ Standard Library named libc++, dual-licensed under the MIT License and the UIUC license.

Since v9.0.0, it was relicensed to the Apache License 2.0 with LLVM Exceptions.

===Polly===
This implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.

===Debugger===
===C Standard Library===
llvm-libc is an incomplete, upcoming, ABI independent C standard library designed by and for the LLVM project.

== Derivatives ==
Due to its permissive license, many vendors release their own tuned forks of LLVM. This is officially recognized by LLVM&#x27;s documentation, which suggests against using version numbers in feature checks for this reason. Some of the vendors include:
* AMD&#x27;s AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler is based on LLVM, Clang, and Flang.
* Apple maintains an open-source fork for Xcode.
* Arm provides a number of LLVM based toolchains, including Arm Compiler for Embedded targeting bare-metal development and Arm Compiler for Linux targeting the High Performance Computing market
* Flang, Fortran project in development 
* IBM is adopting LLVM in its C/C++ and Fortran compilers.
* Intel has adopted LLVM for their next generation Intel C++ Compiler.
* The Los Alamos National Laboratory has a parallel-computing fork of LLVM 8 named &quot;Kitsune&quot;.
* Nvidia uses LLVM in the implementation of its NVVM CUDA Compiler. The NVVM compiler is distinct from the &quot;NVPTX&quot; backend mentioned in the Backends section, although both generate PTX code for Nvidia GPUs.
* Since 2013, Sony has been using LLVM&#x27;s primary front-end Clang compiler in the software development kit (SDK) of its PlayStation 4 console.

<text>Events in the year 1989 in the Republic of India.

1989 was a very important year in the history of World and India. That was the year in which Berlin Wall was brought down and Tiananmen Square protests happened.

In India this was the year of profound importance. It was the year, from which the political discourse of India started to change, with events that heralded the rise of Hindu nationalism, Kashmir militancy, Mandal Politics, Indian cricket etc. and marked the shift from era of single party rule to decades of coalition governments ahead. In socio-political discourse of country, this was a year which started the shift of, &quot;sense of history in minds of people&quot; from a consensus based one that emerged post 1947 to contested one that emerged along with Ram Janmabhoomi Andolan.

<doc id="654617" wikidata="Q1784393" url="?curid=654617" title="Korenizatsiia">
<text>Korenizatsiia (, ; ) was an early policy of the Soviet Union for the integration of non-Russian nationalities into the governments of their specific Soviet republics. In the 1920s, the policy promoted representatives of the titular nation, and their national minorities, into the lower administrative levels of the local government, bureaucracy, and nomenklatura of their Soviet republics. The main idea of the korenizatsiia was to grow communist cadres for every nationality. In Russian, the term () derives from (, &quot;native population&quot;). The policy practically ended in the mid-1930s with the deportations of various nationalities.

Politically and culturally, the nativization policy aimed to eliminate Russian domination and culture in Soviet republics where ethnic Russians did not constitute a majority. This policy was implemented even in areas with large Russian-speaking populations; for instance, all children in Ukraine were taught in the Ukrainian language in school. The policies of korenizatsiia facilitated the Communist Party&#x27;s establishment of the local languages in government and education, in publishing, in culture, and in public life. In that manner, the cadre of the local Communist Party were promoted to every level of government, and ethnic Russians working in said governments were required to learn the local language and culture of the given Soviet republic.

== Beginnings ==
The nationalities policy was formulated by the Bolshevik party in 1913, four years before they came to power in Russia. Vladimir Lenin sent a young Joseph Stalin (himself a Georgian and therefore an ethnic minority member) to Vienna, which was a very ethnically diverse city due to its status as capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Stalin reported back to Moscow with his ideas for the policy. It was summarized in Stalin&#x27;s pamphlet (his first scholarly publication), &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot; (1913).

As adopted in 1923 korenizatsiia involved teaching and administration in the language of the republic; and promoting non-Russians to positions of power in Republic administrations and the party, including for a time the creation of a special administrative units called (, national &quot;selsoviets&quot;) and (, national districts) based on concentrations of minorities within what were minority republics. For example, in Ukraine in the late 1920s there were even &quot;natssovety&quot; for Russians and Estonians.

In 1920s, there still was animosity towards the Russians and towards other nationalities on the part of the Russians, but there were also conflicts and rivalries among other nationalities.

== Against Great-Russian chauvinism ==
In 1923, at the 12th Party Congress, Stalin identified two threats to the success of the party&#x27;s &quot;nationalities policy&quot;: Great Power Chauvinism (, chauvinism of the great power) and local nationalism. However, he described the former as the greater danger:

[The] Great-Russian chauvinist spirit, which is becoming stronger and stronger owing to the N.E.P., . . . [finds] expression in an arrogantly disdainful and heartlessly bureaucratic attitude on the part of Russian Soviet officials towards the needs and requirements of the national republics. The multi-national Soviet state can become really durable, and the co-operation of the peoples within it really fraternal, only if these survivals are vigorously and irrevocably eradicated from the practice of our state institutions. Hence, the first immediate task of our Party is vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism.
The main danger, Great-Russian chauvinism, should be kept in check by the Russians themselves, for the sake of the larger goal of building socialism. Within the (minority) nationality areas new institutions should be organized giving the state a national (minority) character everywhere, built on the use of the nationality languages in government and education, and on the recruitment and promotion of leaders from the ranks of minority groups. On the central level the nationalities should be represented in the Soviet of Nationalities.

== Creation of socialist nations ==
The main idea of the korenizatsiia was to grow communist cadres for every nationality. By the mid-1930s the percentage of locals in both the party and state service grew considerably.

The initial period of korenizatsiia went together with the development of national-territorial administrative units and national cultures. The latter was reflected above all in the areas of language construction and education. For several of the small nationalities in Russia that had no literary language, a &quot;Committee of the North&quot; helped to create alphabets so that the national languages could be taught in schools and literacy could be brought to the people in their native languages—and the minorities would thereby be brought from backwardness to the modern world. And in the very large Ukrainian Republic, the program of Ukrainianization led to a profound shift of the language of instruction in schools to Ukrainian.

In 1930, Stalin proclaimed at the 16th Party Congress that building socialism was a period of blossoming of national cultures. The final goal would be to merge into one international culture with a common language. Meanwhile, the first five-year plan in 1928–1931 was a period of radicalism, utopianism and violence in an atmosphere of &quot;cultural revolution&quot;. Russian cultural heritage was under attack, churches were closed and demolished, old specialists were dismissed, and science and art were proletarianized.

The Bolsheviks&#x27; tactics in their struggle to neutralise nationalist aspirations led to political results by the beginning of the 1930s. The old structure of the Russian Empire had been destroyed and a hierarchical federal state structure, based on the national principle, was created. The structure was nationality-based states in which nationality cultures were blossoming, and nationality languages were spoken and used at schools and in local administration. The transition was real, not merely a centralized Russian empire camouflaged.

The 17th Party congress in 1934, proclaimed that the building of the material basis for a socialist society had succeeded. The Soviet Union first became an officially socialist society in 1936 when the new constitution was adopted. The new constitution stated that the many socialist nations had transformed on a voluntary basis into a harmonious union. According to the new constitution there were 11 socialist republics, 22 autonomous republics, nine autonomous regions and nine national territories. At the same time, administration was now greatly centralised. All the Republics were now harnessed to serve one common socialist state.

== End of korenizatsiia ==

=== Purges of national cadre ===
Between 1933 and 1938 korenizatsiia was not actually repealed. Its provisions merely stopped being enforced. There also began purges of the leaderships of the national republics and territories. The charge against non-Russians was that they had instigated national strife and oppressed the Russians or other minorities in the republics. In 1937, the Soviet government proclaimed that local elites had become hired foreign agents and their goal had become dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the restoration of capitalism. Now it was time to see that the Russians got fair treatment. National leaderships of the republics and autonomies were liquidated en masse.

=== Reversal to Russification ===
By the mid-1930s, with purges in some of the national areas, the policy of korenizatsiia took a new turn, and by the end of the 1930s the policy of promoting local languages began to be balanced by greater Russianization, though perhaps not overt Russification or attempts to assimilate the minorities. By this time, non-Russians found their appetite whetted rather than satiated by korenizatsiia and there was indication it was encouraging inter-ethnic violence to the extent that the territorial integrity of the USSR would be in danger. In addition, ethnic Russians resented the institutionalized and artificial &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; that benefited non-Russians and regarded them as ungrateful and manipulative as a result. Another concern was that the Soviet Union&#x27;s westernmost minorities – Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, Finns etc. – who had been previously treated with conscious benevolence in order to provide propaganda value to members of their ethnic groups in nations bordering the USSR (and thus facilitating future national unification, which would then bring about territorial expansion of the USSR) were now instead increasingly seen as vulnerable to influence from across the border, &quot;fifth columns&quot; for expansionist states seeking to acquire Soviet territory inhabited by their own ethnic group. The adherence of the masses to national rather than class identity was as strong in Russia as in other republics and regions. Between 1937 and 1953, racial policies began to creep into nationality policies, with certain nationalities seen as having immutable traits, particularly nationalities in the unstable borderlands.

Moreover, Stalin seemed set on greatly reducing the number of officially recognized nationalities by contracting the official list of nationalities in the 1939 census, compared with the 1926 census. The development of so-called &quot;national schools&quot; () in which the languages of minority nationalities were the main media of instruction continued, spreading literacy and universal education in many national minority languages, while teaching Russian as a required subject of study. The term korenizatsiia went out of use in the latter half of the 1930s, replaced by more bureaucratic expressions, such as &quot;selection and placement of national cadres&quot; ().

From 1937, the central press started to praise Russian language and Russian culture. Mass campaigns were organized to denounce the &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. &quot;Bourgeois nationalists&quot; were new enemies of the Russian people which had suppressed the Russian language. The policy of indigenization was abandoned. In the following years, the Russian language became a compulsory subject in all Soviet schools.

Pre-revolution Russian nationalism was also rehabilitated. Many of the heroes of Russian history were re-appropriated for glorification. The Russian people became the &quot;elder brother&quot; of the &quot;socialist family of nations&quot;. A new kind of patriotism, Soviet patriotism, emerged, with national survival taking priority over ideological conflicts between communists and fascists.

In 1938, Russian became a mandatory subject of study in all non-Russian schools. In general, the cultural and linguistic russification reflected the overall centralization imposed by Stalin. The Cyrillic script was instituted for a number of Soviet languages, including the languages of Central Asia that in the late 1920s had been given Latin alphabets to replace Arabic ones.

Moldova became part of the USSR as a consequence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Soon after, the language of the country was renamed to &quot;Moldavian&quot; and it ceased being written in the Latin alphabet, changing to Cyrillic. This policy would only be reversed in 1989, after large demonstrations imbued with patriotic feeling. Romanian is an official language in the Moldovan constitution since its independence, and it is Moldova&#x27;s sole official language today. Russian is still in use but not as important as it was in the Soviet era, since it has no special status in the country and its usage as mother tongue has been declining for some time.

During the Soviet era, a significant number of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians migrated to other Soviet republics, and many of them settled there. According to the last census in 1989, the Russian &#x27;diaspora&#x27; in the Soviet republics had reached 25 million.

Some historians evaluating the Soviet Union as a colonial empire (&quot;Soviet Empire&quot;), applied the &quot;prison of nations&quot; idea to the USSR. Thomas Winderl wrote &quot;The USSR became in a certain sense more a prison-house of nations than the old Empire had ever been.&quot;

<text>Swim Ireland () is the national governing body of swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming and synchronised swimming in the island of Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland). Competitors from Northern Ireland can opt to compete for British Swimming in international competitions, with the exception of the Commonwealth Games where they can compete for Northern Ireland.

Swim Ireland is affiliated with LEN, FINA and the Olympic Council of Ireland.

== History ==
Swim Ireland emerged in 1998 from the Irish Amateur Swimming Association (IASA), that was dissolved in January 1999 following proven sexual abuse and other scandals involving senior coaches. Swim Ireland assumed IASA abuse victim liabilities.

== Domestic competitions ==
Swim Ireland runs national meets which include:
*Dave McCullagh Memorial (March/April)
*Irish Open Championships (April/May)
*Irish Age Groups Division 2 (June)
*Irish Age Group/Youth Championships (July)
*Irish Open SC Championships (July/August)
*Irish Open Diving Championships (November)
*Irish Age Groups Division 1
Swim Ireland works with the different regions in organising competitions such as provincial Age Group Championships as well as other graded, distance and inter-club meets. They also work with the Irish Schools Swimming Association who run the Irish Minor and Secondary Schools Championships.

The Age Group InterProvincial takes place every year at the beginning of the summer months for swimmers up to the age of 16 years. This is where teams from the 4 provinces of Ireland (Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht) compete against each other.

These competitions take place in either the National Aquatic Centre, Dublin or at University Arena, Limerick. Both pools have the compatibility to be changed into 50m and 25m.

In 2003, Swim Ireland hosted the European Short Course Championships at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin. The event was a resounding success with a world record being broken by the Dutch in the final race, the men&#x27;s 4x50m Freestyle relay.

Swim Ireland also organise The Liffey Swim which takes place in August to September annually.

== Irish swimmers ==
Swim Ireland recently introduced a new squad structure. This begins with Club Level, then Regional Level, National Level and finally the Elite Squad.

<doc id="654620" wikidata="Q7415733" url="?curid=654620" title="Sanctum (1998 video game)">
<text>Sanctum is a two-player digital collectible card game, played online against human opponents. Players log into a &quot;Game Lobby&quot; (known as &quot;The Gate&quot;) to find other players to challenge to a match. It runs on the Windows operating system. It was developed by Digital Addiction in 1997, and was launched to public participation on July 9, 1998. At its peak, the game had over 1200 active participants (who logged in at least twice weekly over a period of three months). Registered users reached 82,000 by 1999, and by May, 2000 had over 100 thousand registered users. It was one of the first online trading card games, and received many favorable reviews.

The virtual &quot;collectible cards&quot; include common, uncommon, and rare, with different powers, in-game functions and artwork. They do not exist as actual physical cards (with the exception of a few that were distributed by Digital Addiction for promotional purposes) but they are owned and traded in an online account, and are played solely within the virtual environment of Sanctum. A registered player is given a certain number of free cards to play, and additional cards can be purchased through the online card store.

Sanctum has had a devoted user following, with player clubs and cabals, tournaments and prizes, secondary card markets, fan fiction, trivia contests, and dozens of fan web sites.

Sanctum is currently run by members of its community. The most recent update to the game was released February 17, 2014.

== Game overview ==

The goal of each player is to defend his or her sanctum from encroachment by their opponent. If a player manages to get some of their units into the opponent&#x27;s sanctum, the game is over with that player declared the winner.

The game is played on a diagonally aligned grid of square tiles. The player&#x27;s home base appears in the bottom rows, taking up five squares in a plus-sign shape; the opponent&#x27;s sanctum similarly was located in the top rows. Five towns are placed on the board, one in one of the two center squares, and each pair of the other four are located closer to one sanctum than the other. No two towns are closer than two spaces apart, and each player&#x27;s sanctum was the same number of moves to its closest town, and so on, such that no player has a tactical advantage from town placement. The rest of the squares of the grid are randomly assigned one of the basic terrain types: plains, forest, desert, water, swampland or mountains.

Sanctums and towns produce one of six &quot;mana&quot; types every turn (Clarity, Mystery, Order, Strife, Will, and World), with sanctums only able to produce the type of mana associated with the house the player utilized, while towns can be dedicated to any mana of the player&#x27;s choice. Players assemble &quot;decks&quot; out of their virtual cards. Each card has a cost in mana, and has varying effects. Each player is dealt five cards out of their decks, and can cast as many in their turn as their mana allows, as well as discard up to one. At the end of their turn, a player&#x27;s hand is replenished to five cards.

Towns and sanctums also periodically produce novices every so many turns (every other turn for towns, and every fourth turn for sanctums). These are trained as Swordsmen or Archers to fight for their player, to attack monsters summoned by the enemy, to capture towns, or ultimately to capture the enemy Sanctum. These units can stack in groups of up to eight, and individuals or entire groups can be affected by various spells.

== Structure ==

As with many fantasy games, spell-casting in Sanctum is constrained by a limited resource called Mana. In this game, mana comes in six types, in three pairs of opposites:

*Strife / Order
*Clarity / Mystery
*Will / World

There are also twelve &quot;houses&quot;, each holding claim to a specific pair of mana types, one major and one minor for that house, and a race of beings who serve it with a special power:
Decks of at least 30 cards are constructed and assigned a specific house, though cards from other houses can be included.

==History==

Sanctum was built by Digital Addiction starting in 1996. Released on July 9, 1998, Sanctum was one of the first online collectible card games.

The original development team included artist Lee Moyer, programmer (now conceptual artist and games academic) Ethan Ham, and programmer and author Benjamin Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum&#x27;s World Fantasy Award-nominated story &quot;A Siege of Cranes&quot; is set in the game&#x27;s universe.

In 2000, Digital Addiction closed its doors. Faced with the prospect of the game vanishing, several players created the non-profit company Nioga (&quot;Non-profit International Online Gaming Association&quot;) and acquired the game-related assets of Digital Addiction with the intent of keeping it running for its players. The Nioga members intended to donate all game profits (generated through the sale of virtual cards) to charity. Nioga maintained the game and released an expansion set, &quot;Revolutions.&quot;

Over time, player retention and game revenues dwindled. The non-profit status of Nioga was eventually canceled. On June 1, 2010, the Sanctum servers were shut down at the co-location facility.

In January 2012 a new community effort to make the Sanctum game available for play was started at www.playsanctum.net. On February 17, 2014, it launched a new expansion set, &quot;Allies and Traitors&quot; 

==Reception==
Daniel Erickson reviewed the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;A terrific and addictive online strategy game.&quot;

<doc id="654624" wikidata="Q2001762" url="?curid=654624" title="Taiaha">
<text>A taiaha () is a traditional weapon of the Māori of New Zealand; a close-quarters staff weapon made from either wood or whalebone, and used for short, sharp strikes or stabbing thrusts with efficient footwork on the part of the wielder.

Taiaha are usually between in length. It has three main parts; the &quot;arero&quot; (tongue), used for stabbing the opponent and parrying; the &quot;upoko&quot; (head), the base from which the tongue protrudes; and the &quot;ate&quot; (liver) or &quot;tinana&quot; (body), the long flat blade which is also used for striking and parrying.


==Use==
Mau rākau is the martial art that teaches the use of the taiaha and other Māori weapons in combat. As with other martial arts styles, students of the taiaha spend years mastering the skills of timing, balance and co-ordination necessary to wield the weapon effectively. The taiaha is widely known due to its use in the &quot;wero&quot; — the traditional Māori challenge during the pōwhiri, a formal welcoming ceremony. A &quot;wero&quot; is commonly given to heads of state and visiting dignitaries welcomed to New Zealand.

The taiaha is one of many cultural items which are used to introduce children in school to Māori culture. They are also used in present-day kapa haka competitions, and training with the taiaha is seen as part of the Māori cultural revival.

==History==
The use of traditional Māori weaponry declined after the Europeans arrived in New Zealand. Weapons such as the taiaha were replaced by the Europeans&#x27; muskets and para whakawai, or traditional Māori weaponry training schools, disappeared altogether. As a result, the traditional weaponry knowledge was lost among many Maori tribes. Some tribes managed to maintain their distinctive traditions by passing down traditional knowledge secretly between a few chosen individuals.

During the Māori cultural renaissance in the 1980s, there has been a renewed interest and cultivation of traditional weapons. Although there is a much narrower range of traditional weapons being revived, the Māori weaponry has expanded to become a significant trademark of Māori culture. This revival has been part of the larger Māori cultural renaissance that began in the late 1960s. The survival of Māori weaponry was only possible with the work and activism of remaining experts like Irirangi Tiakiawa, Pita Sharples, John Rangihau, Matiu Mareikura and Mita Mohi.

===Modern para whakawai===
In a modern context, Māori weaponry is severely limited to just a few types, with the taiaha being one of the most popular. Likewise, only a small number of para whakawai are in operation—most are taught within a tribal framework. Much of the knowledge within today&#x27;s para whakawai is presented with a background of a deeper tribal history, offering a strong sense of identity, kinship and belonging.

The para whakawai on Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua trains members of Te Arawa and other interested individuals in weaponry ideologies, theories and beliefs. This programme was established under the guidance of Mita Mohi in the mid-1980s. This programme was extended to the Christchurch area in the 90s being delivered by Temairiki Williams and the group Te Tohu O Tu.

The para whakawai Te Whare Tū Taua o Aotearoa began at Hoani Waititi Marae in Auckland and grew to include a number of outreach programmes in different regions. It was established by Pita Sharples in the 1980s ‘to offer the ancient art of mau rakau back to Maoridom as an innovative programme’.

==Weapons training==
Warfare and weaponry were essential to the traditionally militant Māori society. Children were prepared for warfare from an early age. Their early training included playing activities like boxing, wrestling and stick-throwing games.

In the para whakawai, the young men learned mau rākau (the use of weapons). They were instructed in battle formations, weapon use, and attack and defense maneuvers. They would often participate in mock battles using reeds instead of the real weapons. Rakanga waewae (skilful footwork) was vital to fighting and using weapons. Using weapons, especially the taiaha, takes &quot;a lot of maneuvering. It is dangerous. It requires hours, days, months and years of constant use to master it.&quot;

===Weapons===
To Māori, weapons were more than just implements of warfare — they were taonga (treasures), and handed down as precious heirlooms from generation to generation. Weapons were made of wood, stone and bone in a slow, painstaking process. Traditionally, a long weapon from hardwood could take months to shape and decorate; a stone patu would take over a year to complete. Though it took time to fashion weapons, the level of dedication and pride in creating these objects made them valuable. Karakia (incantations) were sometimes said over weapons to imbue them with deities and make them tapu (sacred).

==Popular culture==

*The coat of arms of New Zealand depicts a Māori warrior with a taiaha as one of the supporters.
*The New Zealand Army includes an image of a taiaha in its official badge since 1998.
* The squadron badge of No. 3 Squadron Royal New Zealand Air Force is a Maori Warrior wielding a Taiaha.
* The unit badge of the RNZAF Police depicts a griffin holding a Taiaha.
*The taiaha was featured in the award-winning 2002 film, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; and more briefly in the film &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;.
*In the TV series, &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot;, the taiaha is one of the Māori warrior&#x27;s weapons in a contest with a Shaolin monk.
*The taiaha was also featured in two video games for the PlayStation 2, &quot;The Mark of Kri&quot; and its sequel &quot;Rise of the Kasai&quot; as a weapon for the games&#x27; hero, Rau. In &quot;The Mark of Kri&quot;, the taiaha is plunged into the ground but, in Māori culture, this is an offense as the taiaha itself is seen as a guardian ancestor related to the war god Tūmatauenga, father of the first man. 
* The character Haka from the card game Sentinels of the Multiverse wields a taiaha as a weapon.
* Taiaha Peak in the Southern Alps is named after the taiaha.

<doc id="654626" wikidata="Q2365478" url="?curid=654626" title="Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll">
<text>Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll (c. 1433 – 10 May 1493) was a medieval Scottish nobleman, peer, and politician. He was the son of Archibald Campbell, Master of Campbell and Elizabeth Somerville, daughter of John Somerville, 3rd Lord Somerville. He had the sobriquet Colin Mulle, Bold Earl Colin.

==Biography==
Colin Campbell&#x27;s father, Archibald Campbell Master of Campbell, died in 1440 and young Colin became the heir of his grandfather Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell. When his grandfather died in 1453, Colin succeeded him to become 2nd Lord Campbell. Colin was still a minor and was placed in the custody of his uncle, Colin Campbell, 1st of Glenorchy. In 1457, he was created Earl of Argyll by King James II of Scotland, who was grateful for the loyalty of his father during the troubles early in his reign. In 1460, Campbell had a commission as Bailie of Cowal.

His uncle Colin arranged his marriage with Isabella Stewart, daughter and co-heiress of John Stewart, Lord Lorne (d.1463). Through this marriage, he received Castle Gloom (he would change the name of the castle to &quot;Castle Campbell&quot; in February 1490), and the neighboring estate in the parish of Dollar in Clackmannanshire. Castle Campbell then became the primary seat of the Earls and Dukes of Argyll for the next two centuries.

The exact date of the marriage is unknown, but in 1460, shortly after the boy-king, James III of Scotland, came to the throne, Campbell was called upon to intervene in a feud in his wife&#x27;s family. Allan MacDougall (called Allan of Lorne of the Wood), desiring to hold the estates belonging to his elder brother, John Ker of Lorne, seized his brother and imprisoned him in a dungeon on the island of Kerrera, with the intention of starving him to death. Campbell appeared with a fleet of war galleys and completely defeated MacDougall, burning his fleet, killing most of his men, and restoring the elder brother to his rightful inheritance.

===Servant of James III===
Colin Campbell was often sent on diplomatic missions, the first in 1463, when King James III sent him to negotiate a truce with King Edward IV of England. One of the main terms was that neither king would support the enemies of the other.

In 1464, Campbell was made master of the King&#x27;s household. In 1465, he was appointed Lord Justiciary of Scotland, south of the Firth of Forth, a position he held in conjunction with Robert Boyd, 1st Lord Boyd, until Boyd fell out with the King and fled to England later in 1469, at which time, Campbell held the position alone. In 1466, he founded a chapel dedicated to St. Ninian at Dunure in Ayrshire.

As a result of his marriage with Isabel Stewart, Campbell acquired the title Lord Lorne in 1469, which had previously been held by his wife&#x27;s uncle, John Stewart. In exchange for this title, Campbell gave Stewart other lands, and Stewart received the title Lord Innermeath. 
Having received the title Lord Lorne, Campbell took the symbol of the galley from the Lorne heraldry as part of his Achievement. In the event that he might never have a male heir, he entailed the lordship of Lorne to his uncle Colin; if his uncle were to die, to his other uncle, Duncan Campbell; then to Colin Campbell of Arduquholm and to the heirs male of his body, which failing, then to his brothers, Archibald and Robert. In 1471, he received the heritable offices of Justiciary and Sheriff of Lorne.

On 15 January 1472, King James III granted Dunoon Castle to Campbell and his heirs, with the power to appoint constables, porters, jailers, watermen, and other necessary offices. At the same time, he granted him the lands of Borland. On 20 February 1473, Campbell was made Justiciar, Chamberlain, Sheriff, and Bailie within the King&#x27;s lordship of Cowal. Then on 8 May 1474, he received a charter to erect his town of Inverary into a burgh of barony.

In 1474, Campbell was again sent as a commissioner to treat with King Edward IV, regarding breaches of the truce. In the resulting pact, which was to endure until July 1483, a marriage was arranged between Prince James Stewart of Scotland (King James III&#x27;s son) and Princess Cecily of England (King Edward IV&#x27;s daughter), a match which did not come to pass due to continued hostilities between the two nations.

In 1475, when King James III was trying to subjugate John of Islay, Earl of Ross, Campbell was given a commission of lieutenancy to execute the forfeiture of the Earl of Ross&#x27; lands. In 1479, he was confirmed in the offices of Lieutenant and Commissary of Argyll, which had been held by his ancestors, Gillespic and Colin Campbell, since 1382.

Further favors came to the Earl of Argyll in 1480, when the King granted him 160 marklands of the lordship of Knapdale, including the keeping of Castle Sween, for one silver penny in blench farm, i.e., nominal rent. This property had formerly belonged to the Earl of Ross. Early in 1483, King James III appointed Campbell as Lord High Chancellor of Scotland and awarded him the lands of Pinkerton in the barony of Dunbar, probably for Campbell&#x27;s loyalty to the King during the rebellion of Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus, which had led to the murder of some of King&#x27;s favorites, after the confrontation at Lauder in 1482. These lands had previously been held by the King&#x27;s brother, Prince Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, who was in league with the Earl of Angus.

In 1484, Campbell was active in diplomatic campaigns. In July, he was sent as a commissioner to Paris to renew the &quot;ancient league&quot; between France and Scotland, a mission completed on 9 July. Then on 21 September, once King James III had gotten the upper hand against the rebels, he was part of the delegation who met with King Richard III of England at Nottingham to conclude peace, a treaty which was to run until September 1487. He was also appointed to periodically meet with the English at Berwick to determine whether or not the stipulations in the treaty were being followed. To strengthen the resolve of the parties and to keep the truce, a second marriage was arranged, between Prince James Stewart and Lady Ann de la Pole (1476–1495), daughter of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, and a niece of King Richard III. This second marriage negotiation collapsed as a result of King Richard&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

===Rebellion against James III===
Campbell threw in with the rebels, after Parliament had strengthened King James&#x27;s hand against the rebellious nobles in October 1487. At about this time, the King forced Campbell out of the chancellorship, in favor of William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen. In 1488, Campbell was not present at the Battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June, or in the days following, because he was in England on an embassy to King Henry VII of England, having been sent there on behalf of Prince James Stewart and the rebels to seek English help against King James III.

After Prince James was crowned as &quot;James IV&quot;, he restored Campbell to the position of High Chancellor. Furthermore, the new king gave him the lands of Rosneath in Dunbartonshire on 9 January 1490, which remained in the Campbell family until 1939. Campbell continued in favor with King James IV, and on 21 December 1491, he was one of the conservators of the truce between England and Scotland, which was extended to 1496. One author has claimed that, one reason James III of Scotland has long had a sinister reputation is that &quot;such accounts as we have of him are written by the partisans of his unruly nobles, such as the Earls of Argyll, Lennox, and Angus&quot;.

Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, died in 1493, and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church on Cowal Peninsula. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Archibald Campbell.

==Family==
By his wife, Isabel Stewart, Campbell had two sons and seven daughters:

* Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll
* Thomas Campbell, ancestor of the Campbells of Lundie in Forfarshire.
* Margaret Campbell, married to George Seton, Lord Seton.

<doc id="654636" wikidata="Q6536624" url="?curid=654636" title="Lewis Grizzard">
<text>Lewis McDonald Grizzard Jr. (October 20, 1946 – March 20, 1994) was an American writer and humorist, known for his Southern demeanor and commentary on the American South. Although he spent his early career as a newspaper sports writer and editor, becoming the sports editor of the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; at age 23, he is much better known for his humorous newspaper columns in the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;. He was also a popular stand-up comedian and lecturer.

Grizzard also published a total of 25 books, including collections of his columns (e.g. &quot;Chili Dawgs Always Bark at Night&quot;), expanded versions of his stand-up comedy routines (&quot;I Haven&#x27;t Understood Anything Since 1962&quot;), and the autobiographical &quot;If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I&#x27;m Gonna Nail My Feet to the Ground&quot;. Although much of his comedy discussed the South and Grizzard&#x27;s personal and professional lives, it was also a commentary on issues prevalent throughout America, including relationships between men and women (e.g. &quot;If Love Were Oil, I&#x27;d Be About a Quart Low&quot;), politics, and health, especially heart health. Grizzard was also the stepbrother of the Southern humorist Ludlow Porch.

==Biography==
Grizzard was born in Fort Benning, Georgia. His father, Lewis Grizzard, Sr., was a soldier in the United States Army who served in both World War II and the Korean War, and was a sole survivor of a Chinese attack that wiped out his platoon. Lewis Sr. left his wife Christine, a school teacher, when Lewis Jr. was young, and mother and son moved in with Christine&#x27;s parents in Moreland, Georgia, where Lewis spent the rest of his childhood. Grizzard recounted his often frustrating relationship with his father in &quot;My Daddy Was a Pistol and I&#x27;m a Son of a Gun&quot;, and blamed his father&#x27;s difficulties in civilian life on what at the time was called &quot;battle fatigue&quot; and is now called post-traumatic stress disorder, saying, &quot;Daddy came home from his second war&quot; (the Korean War) &quot;a complete mess, the Army did nothing to help him, and he died young.&quot; He began his writing early, publishing stories of his Little League team in the nearby &quot;Newnan Times-Herald&quot;, Newnan, Georgia.

Grizzard attended the University of Georgia in Athens, where he was a member of the Sigma Pi fraternity and Gridiron Secret Society. During his time in Athens, he became an avid Georgia Bulldogs fan. He studied journalism, but he shunned the school newspaper in favor of the independent &quot;Athens Daily News&quot;. Before graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism, Grizzard moved on to Atlanta, joining the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;, and becoming the youngest-ever executive sports editor of the &quot;Journal&quot; at the age of 23. The executive editor of the &quot;Journal&quot;, Jim Minter, said that had Grizzard stayed there, he would be remembered today as one of the great newspaper editors of the 20th century. His time there included the Marshall University football team tragedy and the &quot;Journal&quot;″s coverage of Hank Aaron&#x27;s 715th home run.

Grizzard then left to become the executive sports editor at the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. He later recalled this as the most miserable period of his life. His tenure included a controversy involving the removal of several news columns written by Lacy Banks, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;″ first African-American sports columnist, from the newspaper, which resulted in Banks charging racism against Grizzard and led to Banks&#x27;s subsequent firing. Although the newspaper, under editor Jim Hoge, supported Grizzard, a federal arbitrator reinstated Banks, and he criticized Grizzard as &quot;racially insensitive&quot;. Grizzard, for his part, contended that the arbitrator did not understand the newspaper business, and he pointed out that he had replaced Banks with Thom Greer, a writer who was also African-American. Grizzard felt this invalidated any charge of racism. One Chicago radio announcer who sympathized with Grizzard said that Grizzard had been pronounced &quot;guilty by geography&quot;. Grizzard was also divorced for the second time while living in Chicago. Grizzard&#x27;s career as a newspaper man in Chicago is recalled in &quot;If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I&#x27;m Gonna Nail My Feet to the Ground&quot;.

In 1977, Grizzard returned to Atlanta as a columnist for the sports section of the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; newspaper. After eight months, he switched to writing the humor/life column that eventually made him famous. He published this column about four days per week. At his peak, he was syndicated in 450 newspapers and making regular appearances on television and the stand-up comedy circuit. His popularity in Atlanta was such that the alternative newspaper &quot;Creative Loafing&quot;, in its annual &quot;Best of Atlanta&quot; poll, included the categories &quot;Best Columnist&quot; and &quot;Best Columnist besides Lewis Grizzard&quot;.

Grizzard often drew criticism for his disparaging remarks about gay people and feminists, and his dislike for the New South and reflections on the &quot;Old South&quot; of his youth were frequently misinterpreted. Nevertheless, he was extremely popular in the South, and he had enduring popularity across the nation because of the perceived humor, humanity, patriotism, and &quot;old-fashioned&quot; values that permeated his writing. His frequent bewilderment by sociocultural trends in the 1980s and 1990s struck a chord with many baby boom readers. Grizzard refused to use computers, writing every column or book on a regular typewriter. (&quot;When I write, I like to hear some noise&quot;, he wrote.)

In 1988, Grizzard made his acting debut on the sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot;, in the episode &quot;Oh Brother&quot;, which first aired on 18 January 1988. Grizzard played the role of Clayton Sugarbaker, the half-brother of Julia and Suzanne Sugarbaker. Clayton was a former mental patient aspiring to be a stand-up comedian.

Grizzard had a somewhat troubled life, battling alcoholism, and going through three divorces. He was voted &quot;the Author From Hell&quot; at a publishing convention for his behavior on book tours. He also suffered from a congenital heart defect — a valve problem. In his own words, &quot;There are three little leaflets that control the flow of blood to the heart. I was born with only two of those leaflets. It was just after the Great War, so there may have been a shortage. Either that or my daddy didn&#x27;t get a good toe-hold.&quot; His near-death after his third valve-replacement surgery in 1993 brought in over 50,000 letters from well-wishers. He later attributed his miraculous recovery to the prayers of his fans.

A few days after marrying for the fourth time, Grizzard died of complications of his fourth heart-valve surgery. Prior to his surgery, he was asked if he had any questions; his reply: &quot;I just have one question: When&#x27;s the next bus to Albuquerque?&quot; As a result of the surgery, Grizzard suffered from brain damage, according to one report, from lack of oxygen to his brain. Had he survived, he would have been quite impaired. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and some of his ashes were scattered at the 50-yard line of the Sanford Stadium at the University of Georgia. The typewriter he used to author columns about the Atlanta Braves&#x27; 1991 &quot;worst to first&quot; season is on display in the library of the University of Georgia&#x27;s Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.

Grizzard never fathered any children, but he did adopt Jordan, the daughter of his fourth wife.

A Lewis Grizzard Museum, featuring personal effects and professional memorabilia such as his typewriter, is now open in Moreland, Georgia. Originally housed in a gas station by a fan, it has been moved to a new, two-story museum complex (the former Moreland Mill).

<text>Gillespie Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll ( – 9 September 1513) was a Scottish nobleman and politician who was killed at the Battle of Flodden.

==Biography==
Archibald was the eldest son of Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll and Isabel Stewart, daughter of John Stewart and Agnes MacDonald.

He was made Master of the Royal Household of James IV of Scotland on 24 March 1495. After a crisis of law and order in the west of Scotland, Argyll was made governor of Tarbert Castle and Baillie of Knapdale, and this was followed by an appointment as Royal Lieutenant in the former Lordship of the Isles on 22 April 1500. Argyll eventually rose to the position of Lord High Chancellor of Scotland. His &quot;clan&quot; was rivalled only by Clan Gordon.

The Earls of Argyll were hereditary Sheriffs of Lorne and Argyll. However, a draft record of the 1504 Parliament of Scotland records a move to request Argyll to hold his Sherriff Court at Perth, where the King and his council could more easily oversee proceedings, if the Earl was found at fault. The historian Norman Macdougall suggests this clause may have been provoked by Argyll&#x27;s kinship with Torquil MacLeod and MacLean of Duart. These western chiefs supported the suppressed Lordship of the Isles.

The Earl of Argyll was killed at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, with the king and many others. He is buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

==Family==
By his wife Elizabeth, a daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox and Agnes MacDonald, had issue:
* Colin Campbell
* Archibald Campbell of Skipness (d 1537 escaping from Edinburgh Castle), second husband of Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis
* Sir John Campbell of Calder (d.1546) ancestor of the Earls Cawdor

<doc id="654645" wikidata="Q1240821" url="?curid=654645" title="Spike and Suzy">
<text>Spike and Suzy (British title), Willy and Wanda (American title) or Luke and Lucy (in a 2009 film and video game) (, ) is a Belgian comics series created by the comics author Willy Vandersteen.

It was first published in &quot;De Nieuwe Standaard&quot; in 1945 and soon became popular. Although not in its earliest form, the strip soon adapted the Ligne claire style, pioneered by Hergé. This change took place when the strip became serialised in Hergé&#x27;s magazine &quot;Tintin&quot; from 1948 to 1959.

The books revolve around the adventures of the eponymous Spike and Suzy, two children (pre-adolescent or adolescent depending on the album), along with their friends and family. The stories combine elements of comedy, fantasy, and science fiction, such as talking animals, time travel and ghosts. The strip still runs daily in the Belgian newspaper &quot;De Standaard&quot;, and new books continue to be published; as of May 2020, 382 albums have been published.

==Main characters==
The main characters are a group of friends, living familywise though the only blood-relation is Sidonia being an aunt of Suzy. In the first regular comic, Suzy and her aunt Sidonia meet the orphan Spike and unrelated Professor Barabas. In the next album &quot;De Sprietatoom&quot;, they also meet Ambrose. Later, in &quot;De dolle musketiers&quot; (book #18, 1953), Jerom (called Jethro in the UK version), the &quot;strongest man in the western hemisphere&quot;, was introduced. Apart from Suzy and Aunt Sidonia, none of them are related, and other family is only introduced occasionally to drive a particular story.

* Spike: originally Suske (Flemish diminutive of François/Franciscus), also known as Willy or Bob (in French), is a young orphan who becomes friends with Suzy and Aunt Sidonia. This happens only in the second album, &quot;Het Eiland Amoras&quot; from 1946, which would become the first in the regular series. For the first album, the publisher had pushed Vandersteen to go with the name and character &quot;Rikki&quot;, but the author soon worked around this and found a way to introduce &quot;Suske&quot;, in part because he thought Rikki resembled Tintin too much.
:Spike has black hair with a small trademark spike. He started out as a hyperactive and headlong fighter, not unlike many a young male adolescent in the &quot;Seefhoek&quot;, the Antwerp neighbourhood where Vandersteen grew up. Only in the first album, Spike would get totally out of control when he heard the battle cry &quot;Seefhoek vooruit!&quot; (&quot;Seefhoek Forward!&quot;), replaced by &quot;Antigoon vooruit&quot; in later reprints. But as soon as his outfit evolved from mere duds towards a more tidy red polo shirt and black trousers, he became a well-behaved and obedient boy. He is smart, brave, idealistic and mostly rational, making him an emotional opposite to Suzy. Where she gets in trouble with Sidonia or Ambrose, he acts as go-between to restore peace.
* Suzy: originally Wiske (Flemish diminutive of Louise/Louisa), also known as Wanda or Bobette (in French), is the young heroine. She first appeared in the very first out-of-series prequel &quot;Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije&quot; from 1945, where she has an older brother Rikki, but he disappears after that story to be replaced by Spike.
:Suzy lives together with him and her aunt Sidonia, and is typically (certainly in the older stories) dressed in a white dress with a red stripe just above the hem, and a red ribbon in her fair hair. In the first stories, she looks like a preschooler of about 6 years old, but soon afterwards she evolves into a young teenager of about 12-13. Vandersteen seems to have modelled her after his oldest daughter Leen, of similar age at the time.
:She is strong-headed, impulsive, curious and slightly foolish. Aspects of her character that come naturally with a young teenager who enters puberty, and a great plot device since her repeated stubbornness and disobedience is the source of many an adventure. Since her emotions and human shortcomings often overpower her rationality, she is sensitive to paranormal and mystical happenings that are routinely dismissed by the others. Her relationship with Spike (both are considered orphans) is mostly one between siblings, although at times it looks like there are more feelings under the surface, as she can get quite jealous and querulous when Spike gets female attention. Suzy is also a brave girl, especially when it comes to defending her doll Muffin, for whom she shows unconditional motherly love. Despite her difficult character at times, she appears contrite and righteous. She carries her heart in the right place and won&#x27;t hesitate to battle injustice. Suzy ends most of the albums by winking to the reader from within the very last panel.

* Muffin, originally Schalulleke, later renamed to Schanulleke (sometimes Schabolleke), also known as Molly or Sawdust, is Suzy&#x27;s doll. A small female figure, she is inanimate. She has a major role in a few stories when she gets stolen (album 6, &quot;Prinses Zagemeel&quot;), brought to life, or is turned into a mindless giant.
* Aunt Sidonia, originally called tante Sidonie, later renamed to tante Sidonia, and also once known as Agatha, appears as Suzy&#x27;s aunt, right from the first album. Sidonia was Vandersteen&#x27;s way of providing a caring authority figure for Spike and Suzy without introducing actual parents, who would constrain their adventurous tendencies too much.
:Sidonia is portrayed as a (1950s) housewife (cooking and cleaning, doing the dishes, complaining when Spike and Suzy don’t show proper respect for her household work). Nevertheless she also often joins the heroes on their adventures, and occasionally shows unexpected qualities as pilot of the Gyronef.
:Long and extremely thin with gigantic feet (routinely referred to as &quot;ferries&quot;), with a large protruding chin and fair hair, she’s hardly blessed with physical beauty. As such, her looks are often the target of offensive remarks, in particular by a less than subtle Ambrose. On the other hand, her thinness enables her to pull off tricks like hiding herself in a split second from the bad guys behind nearby streetlights and telephone poles.
:Sidonia is also known for her hysterical nervous breakdowns, where she can often no longer utter words while her body ends up as stiff as a wooden plank, and for her (unrequited) crush on Ambrose.

* Professor Barabas, is a long-time friend of Suzy and Aunt Sidonia, first met in &quot;Het Eiland Amoras&quot; (&quot;An Island called Hoboken&quot;). He starts off as a jungle explorer with a topee, but later becomes the archetypical comics professor: glasses, a white laboratory coat, often absent-minded because he is thinking deeply about some scientific question. Although he is not a mad scientist, and entirely benevolent, his inventions regularly cause trouble when they end up in the wrong hands. This happens more than once because of his lack of streetwiseness in dealing with criminals. His main inventions are the Teletime machine (which enables them to travel through time and space), the Gyronef (a helicopter well ahead of its time), the Terranef (a subterranean vehicle), and the Klankentapper, which enables one to talk with plants and inanimate objects. Contrary to most other main characters, he does not appear in all comics.
* Ambrose, originally called Lambik and once known as Orville, is a bald man (apart from six hairs, three on either side) of about fifty. The original Flemish name was inspired by a Belgian beer Lambic that is brewed in the Belgian region of Pajottenland, where Vandersteen lived for a short time. He is first encountered in album 3, &quot;The Zincshrinker&quot;, as a rather stupid plumber, although Vandersteen already created the standalone personage the year before (1945) as &quot;Pukkel&quot; (&quot;pimple&quot; in English).
:In the beginning, Ambrose was presented as a typical working class member: rough and rather simple and uneducated. Prone to alcoholism and other scourges, he also had a somewhat tragic side. This largely came to an end when Vandersteen started to work for Hergé, who didn&#x27;t like the folksy component. In particular in the period of The Blue Series, Ambrose suddenly becomes sophisticated, bright and brave, even aristocratic (for example he teaches fencing) and is arguably truly the main character of the story in those albums. Later, the personage gets its definitive outfit (black trousers, white starched shirt and a black bow tie) and settles as a middle class part-time father figure for Spike and Suzy, who lives together with Jethro.
:Ambrose is intended as the comic relief of the series. His baldness and pronounced nose inspire ridicule throughout the whole series. Another running gag is that he brings up his World War I military gear (sandbags, barbed wire, helmet, rifle...) when a situation becomes critical. Generally presumptuous, vain and impulsive, he confronts the reader with his own shortcomings. Typically, he considers himself the main hero, and in particular the &quot;brains&quot;, since he can&#x27;t possibly over trump Jethro when it comes to physical power (and as it frequently turns out, not in the intellectual department either!). His friends then usually play along, just to keep him happy. The relationship between Suzy and Ambrose, one even more stubborn than the other, makes for a great generation conflict that spices up many stories. In the end, Ambrose does have a noble nature, as illustrated by the many occasions that he sacrifices himself for the greater good. But it helps a great deal when he is first assured of recognition...

* Jethro, originally known as Jerom or &quot;Jerommeke&quot; and also known as Wilbur, is an extremely strong man, brought from prehistory to the Middle Ages by an alchemist in album 18, &quot;The merry musketeers&quot;, as a mindless weapon.
:Although he is introduced into the series as an opponent, he quickly turns around as he falls in love with Muffin and becomes a caring man instead of a wild beast. Initially he is dressed in a loincloth only (with an occasional cravat added in an amusing attempt to appear more civilized) and speaks in grunts and monosyllables. His prehistoric background causes him to observe the modern world and customs with the naivete (and often unimpeded insight) of a child. But soon afterwards he becomes a smart, sophisticated man, although he still speaks in a peculiar shorthand. He lives together with Ambrose, and his level-headedness is used to contrast with the latter’s foolishness.
:Apart from superhuman strength (used for exploits like squeezing water from rocks in the desert), his special powers include &quot;flashlight eyes&quot; and X-ray vision (at any other time his eyelids remain closed), running faster than sound and stopping bullets with his muscular chest. As such, his character is often used as a deus ex machina solution for the troubles his friends and especially Ambrose get in. But when the scenarists are inspired, he is equally often drugged or away on a trip as to avoid the easy solution for the story.

=== Other recurring characters ===
* Krimson. A principal villain, Krimson was introduced in &quot;Het rijmende paard&quot; (#48, 1963). He survives a plane-crash and starts over as an international drug kingpin in &quot;De sissende sampan&quot; (#49, 1963) before serving a prison-sentence. In &quot;Amoris van Amoras&quot; (#200, 1984) Krimson seems to have changed his ways by becoming a project-developer on Hoboken. This appears to be a passing interest as &quot;De Kwaaie Kwieten&quot; (#209, 1987) marks his return to form by constructing a top-secret military base capable of fighting extraterrestrials. Growing stronger again, Krimson manages to overthrow the Belgian government (&quot;De Krimson Crisis&quot;, #215, 1988). For reasons unknown he often suffers from mental breakdowns, throwing fits until his butler force feeds him a large quantity of pills. Despite his name there is no connection between him and the colour crimson, other than that both often have sinister connotations.
* Arthur is Ambrose&#x27;s younger brother who grew up in the jungle and gained the ability to fly from the juice of a plant. He is more primitive than his brother, but substantially smarter. He dresses in animal skins and wears a beard, though it is unknown if he, unlike Ambrose, has much hair on his head as he always sports a bowler hat. He spends more time in the air and in trees than on the ground, and therefore has acquired some bird characteristics, such as standing on his hands instead of his feet and chirping while speaking. His favorite food is birdseed. He has appeared in 5 albums so far.
* Sus Antigoon is an ancestor of Spike, discoverer of Amoras Island and founder of the city Amoras. He died of alcohol abuse and therefore always appears as a ghost with a bottle chained to his leg. Because of his drunkenness, Sus Antigoon often brings the protagonists in danger. He has appeared in 12 albums so far.

===Character evolution===

Over the course of the series, characters are added and changed, and stories become more didactic. Ambrose and Jethro change significantly: in the beginning, Ambrose was just an amusing fool, but in the Blue Series he appears more sophisticated and heroic, evolving towards a cynical and sceptical man in the current stories. In early stories, Jethro was initially portrayed as an ignorant strong man, who evolved into a sophisticated and quiet man in later works. In most stories Muffin is only a doll, but one very special to Suzy, and they are inseparable. In some stories Muffin comes to life and plays an important role.

=== Settings ===
In the earliest stories, Willy Vandersteen used fictional countries like &quot;Chokowakije&quot; (&quot;Chocolaslovakia&quot;) and &quot;Amoras&quot; (a tropical island, &quot;Hoboken&quot;, actually a real town in Belgium, in the English-language version). He dropped the use of those after a few stories, although some later stories revisit Amoras.

Most of the current adventures of Spike and Suzy happen in real countries all over the world, with Belgium (their home country) as main focus for many stories.

While in the early stories large distances were usually traveled using the fictitious &quot;Gyronef&quot;, an experimental helicopter devised by professor Barabas, starting from the 1960s all air travel is provided by the Dutch national airline KLM, making it an early and prominent example of product placement in European comics. Vandersteen chose KLM over the Belgian national airline SABENA because of his friendship with Ron Winderink, PR manager at KLM.

==Publication history==
Willy Vandersteen created &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot;, beginning publication in &quot;De Nieuwe Standaard&quot; on 30 March 1945. To Vandersteen&#x27;s disappointment the editor had renamed the strip&#x27;s first chapter &quot;Rikki en Wiske&quot;. The following story was titled &quot;De avonturen van Suske en Wiske - Op het eiland Amoras&quot; and no longer featured Rikki. After a few years of publication in several newspapers, Vandersteen was approached by Hergé, intent to improve sales of the Dutch-language version of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine (&quot;Kuifje&quot;), who wanted &quot;Suske and Wiske&quot; for his publications redrawn in the Ligne claire style. Vandersteen made the adaptation and &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; first appeared in &quot;Kuifje&quot; and Belgian &quot;Tintin&quot; on 16 September 1948 with the story titled &quot;Het Spaanse spook&quot; and &quot;Le Fantôme Espagnol&quot; in the two languages. All 8 stories that were run until it ended in April 1959 made up the material collected in The Blue Series.

Vandersteen established Studio Vandersteen in 1952 to manage his expanded activities. To have time for other series such as &quot;De Rode Ridder&quot; (&quot;The Red Knight&quot;) and &quot;Tijl Uilenspiegel&quot;, he gave Paul Geerts the job of creating new albums of &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; in 1968. Geerts did this until 2001, when he gave this task to Marc Verhaegen. From 2005 on, a team of writers and cartoonists makes the new series, led by Luc Morjeau. These authors are helped by Studio Vandersteen.

On 17 December 2022, after 77 years, &quot;De Standaard&quot; newspaper ended daily publication of &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot;, following a cost-benefit decision.

==Publications==

===Newspapers and magazines===
Before &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; appeared as albums, they were published in several newspapers and magazines, such as: 
* &quot;De Standaard&quot; (1945–2022) daily newspaper
* &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine and &quot;Kuifje&quot; magazine (1948–1959) Éditions du Lombard&#x27;s French and Dutch sister publications

===Red Series and Blue Series===
The books are generally divided into two groups - &quot;Red Series&quot; and &quot;Blue series&quot;. The Red Series contains the vast majority of the books, and is so called because all of the books in this series have a red coloured cover. There are only a few books in the blue series, and they are so called because of their blue cover. The blue series encompasses all those originally published in &quot;Tintin&quot; and &quot;Kuifje&quot;. The Red series is everything published before or after. The following album series exist:
* 1.The Red Series
# The Flemish non-coloured series (1946–1959): 1-35
# The French non-coloured series
# The non-coloured series in Dutch for the Netherlands (1953–1959): 1-23
# The Flemish two-coloured series (1959–1964): 7,19,20,32-50
# The French two-coloured series
# The Dutch two-coloured series (1959–1964): 1,8,10,11,21-50
# The &quot;uniform&quot; Flemish(-Belgian) - Dutch (two-coloured) series (1964–1966): 51-66 (under flamingantistic influence)
# The four-coloured series (1967-...): 67-... ; the first 66 albums and the blue series have been re-edited in this series.
* 2.The Blue Series (1952–1957)

===Special editions===
Other stories or editions have been published, such as:
# The collector&#x27;s editions (1958-...)
# Advertisement editions (1965-...)
# Various collections (1972-...)
# Holiday editions (1973-...)
# Luxury editions (1977-...)
# Suske en Wiske Classics (1993–1999)

===Albums in English===
English translations have been published in three incarnations. The first was in the U.S., under the name of &quot;Willy and Wanda&quot;. It was then published in the UK in the 1990s named &quot;Bob and Bobette&quot;, a copy of the Belgian title in French. The final print run was in the UK by the title &quot;Spike and Suzy&quot;.

=== Other languages ===

The comic book series was also published in Belgium in French, under the name &quot;Bob et Bobette&quot; (&quot;Bob and Bobette&quot; in English). Translations in other languages (including regional dialects) are plentiful but may exist as short-lived series only.

==Spin-off series==
There have been various spin-off comic series from &quot;Spike and Suzy&quot;:

* In 1960, &quot;Jerom&quot; began publication. It featured the character Jerom (Jethro) and focused on his adventures as a modern-day knight.
* In the 1950s, &quot;Lambik&quot; (Ambrose), ran in the newspaper &quot;De Bond&quot;. These were then put into the albums called &quot;De Grappen van Lambik&quot; (&quot;The jokes of Ambrose&quot;). The series was ended in 1962, but in 2004, it resumed with new stories. Seven books in the new series have been released.
* In 2002, &quot;Klein Suske en Wiske&quot; (&quot;Young Spike and Suzy&quot;) ran in the magazine &quot;Suske en Wiske Weekblad&quot;. It charts the adventures of the children when they were very small, along with their pet dog. So far nine albums have been released, containing short sketches.
* In May 2013, the first edition of &quot;Amoras&quot; was released, a spin-off, more adult-oriented series, with a more manga-like type of drawing and with more violence and strong language. In the series, Spike and Suzy are &#x27;flashed&#x27; by accident to the year 2047 and find themselves on the isle of Amoras (where they were in the first Belgian album). Charel Cambré came up with the original idea and drew the art, the scenario was written by Marc Legendre. The first issue, called Wiske, received a lot of positive response and media coverage. The sixth and last in the spin-off series was published on 4 November 2015.
* Although Standaard uitgeverij was adamant that this was a one time only, news of a new series within the same spin-off universe reached the fans in March 2016. In &#x27;De Kronieken van Amoras&#x27; the reader gets more background info on the events leading to the story in Amoras&#x27; and about the different characters. In March 2017, &quot;De zaak Krimson&quot; was released and there are two more publications planned within this series.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; has reached such a popularity in the Dutch-speaking world that various media adaptations have been made.

===Theatrical adaptations===
In 1949, Dutch puppeteer Karel Weyler of the Flemish puppet theater &quot;Pats&#x27; Poppenspel&quot; adapted some &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; series as puppet plays. Willy Vandersteen enjoyed these versions and gave him permission to make more. The music was composed by Armand Preud&#x27;homme and the dialogues were written by Jef Contrijn, whose wife, Germaine Gijsels also designed the costumes. Vandersteen returned the favor by helping to design the backgrounds and referencing &quot;Pats Poppenspel&quot; in the &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; stories &quot;De Mottenvanger&quot; (&quot;The Moth Catcher&quot;), &quot;De Circusbaron&quot; (&quot;The Circus Baron&quot;), &quot;Het Hondenparadijs&quot; (&quot;The Dog Paradise&quot;), &quot;De Wilde Weldoener&quot; (&quot;The Wild Humanitarian&quot;) and &quot;De Poppenpakker&quot; (&quot;The Puppet Catcher&quot;). Between 1974 and 1977, Vandersteen also made a comics series about &quot;Pats&quot; until copyright issues forced him to change the title into &quot;Tits&quot;.

In 1994, the Royal Youth Theatre of Antwerp made a theatrical musical called &quot;De Stralende Sterren&quot;. It ran for several years and was both a success in Flanders as well as the Netherlands.

In July 2002, a new musical premiered, based on the album &quot;De Spokenjagers&quot; (&quot;The Ghost Hunters&quot;), again touring with huge success in Flanders and the Netherlands.

In 2008, the album &quot;De Circusbaron&quot; (&quot;The Circus Baron&quot;) was adapted into a theatrical musical, which toured in Belgium and the Netherlands.

===TV adaptations===

In 1955, the &quot;Pats Poppenspel&quot; puppet shows were broadcast on Flemish television. This was the first attempt to bring the comics to television. A limited animation series was made the same decade.

Far more successful was the 1975-1976 puppet series. The Belgian TV network BRT produced a TV puppet series consisting of six original stories told by Lambik, all of them broadcast as five-minute episodes, which were each 22 minutes in length. These stories (&quot;De Minilotten van Kokonera&quot;, &quot;De Gouden Locomotief&quot;, &quot;De Zingende Kaars&quot;, &quot;De Windbrekers&quot;, &quot;De Regenboogprinses&quot; and &quot;Het Laatste Dwaallicht&quot;) were later adapted into comic book albums. The puppets were made by &quot;Creatuur&quot; in collaboration with André Henderickx. Vandersteen&#x27;s studio created the backgrounds and props. The series was a tremendous success in the Netherlands and largely responsible for the comics&#x27; ultimate breakthrough there. Re-runs were broadcast in 1985 and 1990.

In the early 1990s, an animated TV series was made by Atelier5, broadcast on VTM. Each episode was based on original &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; stories, with Han Peekel as narrating voice-over. They were also made available on video.

===Film adaptations===

In 2004, the album &quot;De Duistere Diamant&quot; (&quot;The Dark Diamond&quot;) was adapted to the silver screen by Rudi Van den Bossche as the live-action film &quot;&quot;.

A CGI animated film called &quot;Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers&quot; was released in July 2009. Produced by Skyline Entertainment, it was planned to be the first of a series of 13 films.

===Video game adaptations===
In 2001, Infogrames released &quot;Suske en Wiske: De Tijdtemmers&quot; for the Game Boy Color. It was only released in Europe.

On 19 July 2009, a video game was released for the Nintendo DS, based on the 3-D animated movie &quot;Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Suske and Wiske have their own statue in the Antwerp Zoo in Antwerp. It was sculpted by René Rosseel in 1978. Suske, Wiske, Lambik and Jerom also have statues in Middelkerke, sculpted by Monique Mol in respectively 2002, 2005 and 2013

In the Belgian Comic Strip Center in Brussels the permanent exhibition brings homage to the pioneers of Belgian comics, among them Willy Vandersteen. In the room dedicated to his work a replica of Professor Barabas&#x27; teletijdmachine (&quot;tele time machine&quot;) can be seen.

On 15 June 1995, an illustrated wall was dedicated to the series in the Rue de Laeken/Lakensestraat in Brussels. Suske and Wiske are also part of an illustrated wall in the Korte Ridderstraat 8 in Antwerp, which was revealed on 13 May 2006. On 24 April 2009, a similar wall was revealed in Kalmthout.

The character Lambik inspired the name of the Dutch comic book store Lambiek in Amsterdam. The misspelling of the name is due to the fact that the early Dutch publications of &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; called him &quot;Lambiek&quot;. The emblem on the store&#x27;s sign is an image from the &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; story &quot;Prinses Zagemeel&quot; (&quot;Princess Sawdust&quot;) (1947–1948) and represents Lambik&#x27;s metamorphosis into a centaur.

<text>Star Carr is a Mesolithic archaeological site in North Yorkshire, England. It is around five miles () south of Scarborough.
It is generally regarded as the most important and informative Mesolithic site in Great Britain. It is as important to the Mesolithic period as Stonehenge is to the Neolithic period or Scandinavian York is to understanding Viking Age Britain.

The site was occupied during the early Mesolithic archaeological period, which coincided with the preboreal and boreal climatic periods. Though the ice age had ended and temperatures were close to modern averages, sea levels had not yet risen sufficiently to separate Britain from continental Europe. Highlights among the finds include Britain&#x27;s oldest structure, 21 red deer stag skull-caps that may have been headdresses and nearly 200 projectile, or harpoon, points made of red deer antler. These organic materials were preserved due to having been buried in waterlogged peat. Normally all that remains on Mesolithic sites are stone tools.

Excavation of the site began in 1948, a year after artefacts were first noticed by John Moore, an amateur archaeologist. The site is most famous for some of the extremely rare artefacts discovered during the original excavations but its importance has been reinforced by new understandings of the nature and extent of the Mesolithic archaeology in the area and reinterpretations of the original material.

== Geology ==

Star Carr now lies under farmland at the eastern end of the Vale of Pickering. During the Mesolithic the site was near the outflow at the western end of a palaeolake, known as Lake Flixton. At the end of the last ice age a combination of glacial and post-glacial geomorphology caused the area to drain to the west (away from the shortest-distance to the North Sea at Filey). The basin filled by Lake Flixton was probably created by glacial &#x27;scarring&#x27;.

The site is preserved due to Lake Flixton having been in-filled with peat during the course of the Mesolithic. Waterlogged peat prevents organic finds from oxidising and has led to some of the best preservation conditions possible (such conditions have preserved the famous bog bodies found in other parts of northern Europe).
As a result of such good conditions archaeologists were able to recover bone, antler and wood in addition to the flints that are normally all that is left on sites from this period.

During the period of Mesolithic occupation the area surrounding the lake would have been a mixed forest of birch, aspen and willow. The lake edge and shallows would have been full of reeds, water lily and other aquatic plants and lake levels would have changed dynamically in response to rainfall or snow-melt.

These and many other plants would have formed the base of a complex food web. The mammals that we have evidence for include herbivores such as beaver, red deer, roe deer, elk, aurochs, wild boar, hare and carnivores such as wolf, lynx, bear, fox, pine marten, badger and hedgehog.

== Settlement and artefacts ==

Current radiocarbon dates from the site indicate occupation first commenced between 9335 and 9275 BC, lasting for a period of around 800 years until 8525–8440 BC. However, such occupations may have been episodic in nature, varying in intensity between different periods.

A human-made structure approximately wide was present: a hut or substantial shelter. This is known from excavated post holes, a sunken area and concentrations of flints, burning and other artefacts. The posts were almost certainly made of wood and roughly in diameter. There may have been as many as 18 of them and the holes indicated that several may have been replaced over the course of the structure&#x27;s use.
It is impossible to know the form or materials from which the walls and/or roof would have been made. They may have used hides, thatch, turf or bark on a conical (teepee-like) or rounded (wigwam-like) frame. There is no reason to suppose that the same materials and form would have been used for the structure&#x27;s entire life-span. There was evidence that the floor was covered with a layer of moss, reeds and other soft plant materials – deep. Radiocarbon dates indicated a use-life of between 200 and 500 years. The structure has been compared to the Mesolithic structure found at Howick, Northumberland and British Iron Age roundhouses.

A large wooden platform has been discovered nearby on the shore of the former lake – the earliest known example of carpentry in Europe, though its purpose is as yet unknown. Timbers of Aspen and Willow were split along the grain using wedges (probably made of wood and antler); these were then laid in the boggy areas at the lake shore, presumably to provide firm footing.
The extent of the wooden platform is not known but it may be a significantly larger and more complex undertaking than the house-like structure.

Along with the flints that are characteristic of Mesolithic sites, there were a large number of objects made of red deer and elk antler, elk bone, aurochs bone and one piece of bird bone. Rarer objects included worked amber, shale, haematite, iron pyrites, a decorated pendant, thought to be the oldest known Mesolithic art in Britain and tightly-rolled pieces of birch-bark and pieces of birch-resin pitch or tar and worked wood.
The flint found at Star Carr came from nearby beaches, which at time of occupation would have been about distant, and also from the Yorkshire Wolds immediately to the south of the site.

The two most outstanding categories of finds are the &#x27;barbed points&#x27; and &#x27;antler frontlets&#x27;. The barbed points are made of the antler of red deer stags. They are between and in length and the 195 examples found at Star Carr account for more than 95% of the total number from the British Mesolithic. Many of the barbed points and antler frontlets appear to be deliberately broken. The antler frontlets are made from red deer stag (male) skulls with the antlers still attached. The 21 antler frontlets are sufficiently complete to see how they have been manufactured: two holes were perforated through the skull with a flint tool and the inside of the skull cap was smoothed. The antlers on each frontlet have been carefully trimmed, perhaps to reduce weight. It seems very likely that these modifications are designed to allow the frontlets to be used as headgear. Finds from the site are now divided between four institutions: The British Museum, the Yorkshire Museum in York, the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge and the Scarborough Museum.

==History of investigations==

===Discovery and initial excavations===
Star Carr was discovered in 1947 when John Moore, an amateur archaeologist, noticed flints in the exposed soil of several recently dredged ditches in the eastern Vale of Pickering. One of these sites, bordering on the New Hertford River was to the south of Star Carr Farm. Moore decided to excavate a small trench at Star Carr in 1948 as part of a series of investigations. On the discovery of intact organic remains Moore contacted Professor Grahame Clark of the University of Cambridge via Harry Godwin and the curator of the Scarborough Museum, Arthur Roy Clapham.

Clark began his investigation with the explicit aim of building a more detailed picture of the Mesolithic environment and the ways in which people used it. The organic preservation enabled the recovery of the plant and animal remains necessary for this. Clark excavated from 1949 to 1951. Clark&#x27;s 1954 publication of these excavations is a seminal text in the study of the British Mesolithic and prehistory generally.

Clark believed he had uncovered the entirety of the site and believed Star Carr could be used as a type-site for the British Mesolithic. He drew parallels between the finds at Star Carr and the site of Maglemose in Denmark. It is now recognised that many of Clark&#x27;s inferences were incorrect but the excavation remains one of the most important in the study of British prehistory ever undertaken.

===Further investigations: The Lake Flixton Landscape===
In 1977 archaeologists excavated Iron Age, Bronze Age and Mesolithic material from Seamer Carr, just to the north of Star Carr. These excavations were conducted in advance of the Seamer Carr landfill site. The discovery of Mesolithic material led to a new series of investigations around Lake Flixton directed by Tim Schadla-Hall (currently University College London). This team returned to Star Carr in 1985 and 1989.

This project investigated the archaeology and ecology of the wider landscape around Lake Flixton and found several more Mesolithic sites but none with as many of the unusual artefacts (such as barbed points and antler frontlets) discovered at Star Carr.

===Post-2000 investigations===
In the 2000s new excavations began at Star Carr. This reinvestigation is being directed by Nicky Milner (University of York), Chantal Conneller (University of Manchester) and Barry Taylor (University of Chester). This ongoing project has reinvestigated Clark&#x27;s excavations and also excavated the dry-land, discovering the structure.

Most significantly, recent geochemical investigations have demonstrated that the preservation conditions have deteriorated. The result of this is that any remaining organic artefacts will be far less informative than those discovered by previous excavation projects. Though the reasons for this remain somewhat unclear, it appears that the acidity of the groundwater has massively increased in the last few years.

A decorated pendant (the Star Carr Pendant), thought to be the oldest known Mesolithic art in Britain, was found at the site in 2015. The 11,000 year old object has been on display at the Yorkshire Museum with other finds from the site since 2016.

==Interpretive debates==
Clark, the original excavator, believed the Mesolithic people would have lived on a brushwood platform on the edge of the former Lake Flixton. Recent excavations have revealed that people lived on the dry land upslope of the lake and various activities were carried out at the lake edge.

There is much debate about the time of year the site was occupied. Mesolithic people hunted a number of animals including red and roe deer, elk, aurochs and wild boar but there are various seasonal assessments and as the site was occupied over several hundred years it is likely that seasonal practices varied over time.

It has been suggested that the antler frontlets were used as a hunting disguise, or in some form of ritual practice. Recent work suggests that these, along with other objects made from red deer antler, appear to have been respectfully deposited at the lake edge due to the spiritual significance of red deer to the people who occupied the site.

Anthony Legge and Peter Rowley-Conway re-examined the animal bones located at the site. They found strong evidence to suggest that the site was used only in late spring and summer; evidence that the cull of red and roe deer was biased towards three- and one-year-old animals respectively; revision of available meat; reduction in scale of occupation; no bias towards hunting of male red deer, and tentatively suggested that the site was used as a hunting camp.

<text>This is an alphabetical list of loughs (lakes) on the island of Ireland. It also shows a table of the largest loughs. The word &quot;lough&quot; is pronounced like &quot;loch&quot; () and comes from the Irish &quot;loch&quot;, meaning &quot;lake&quot;.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, there are an estimated 12,000 lakes in the Republic of Ireland, covering an area of more than 1,200 square kilometres. The largest lough, by area, in Ireland is Lough Neagh. Lough Corrib is the second largest, and is the largest in the Republic. The largest lough, by water volume, is Lough Neagh, with Lough Mask being the largest in the Republic.

The list below contains only those loughs that are of geographic, geological, or historical importance and almost all of them are over a square kilometre in area. It includes loughs that are in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Those partly or wholly within Northern Ireland are marked with an asterisk (*).

<text>Francisco Martin Duran (; born September 8, 1968) is an American convicted criminal and attempted assassin who, on October 29, 1994, fired 29 rounds from an semi-automatic rifle at the White House in an attempt to kill United States President Bill Clinton. Duran was convicted of attempted assassination and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

== Early life ==
Duran was born in Barelas, an inner-city neighborhood of Albuquerque, New Mexico. He had six half-siblings, all born to different fathers, all of whom moved in and out of his life. His mother was a cleaning lady who received food stamps and other government assistance. 

Duran was arrested at 17 and charged with the attempted theft of a front-end loader that he was going to take for a joyride. The judge made a deal with him that he would drop the charges if he enlisted in the United States Army. Duran accepted the judge&#x27;s deal quickly and willingly, and his mother gave her consent as he was a minor.

== Military career ==
After basic training, Duran was selected as a medical specialist. His first tour of duty was with the 25th Light Infantry Division in Hawaii. He was an unremarkable soldier. During this tour he fell in love and had a son; he was married shortly after.

On August 9, 1990, Duran and a group of Army friends got drunk at a bowling alley and were asked to leave when an argument broke out between the soldiers and some civilians about the soldiers&#x27; boisterous behavior. When the civilians blocked Duran as he tried to leave in his car, Duran confronted one of the civilians and drove away before returning and driving into the crowd outside, injuring a woman, before driving away. He was stopped and arrested by military police.

Duran was court-martialed and found guilty of drunk driving, aggravated assault, drunken and disorderly conduct, and leaving the scene of an accident. He was stripped of rank and sentenced to five years in prison at the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He was released after two and a half years in 1993.

After his release, Duran settled in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and worked as an upholsterer.

== Attempted assassination of Bill Clinton ==
On October 29, 1994, Duran, dressed in a trench coat, approached the fence overlooking the north lawn of the White House and fired 29 7.62×39mm rounds from a Type 56 semi-automatic rifle (a Chinese copy of the SKS) at a group of tourists wearing suits on the White House lawn, specifically a tourist whose haircut was said to resemble that of President Bill Clinton. Passersby wrestled Duran to the ground and subdued him until Secret Service agents arrived to take him into custody. Clinton was reportedly inside watching a football game at the time and was not harmed.

The incident was six weeks after Frank Eugene Corder crashed a Cessna into the south lawn of the White House, and prompted debate about closing off traffic on that area of Pennsylvania Avenue. No one was injured in the assassination attempt.

== Trial ==
The most important charges in Duran&#x27;s two-week trial were attempted murder of the president and four counts of assaulting a federal officer (gained while resisting the Secret Service agents). As Duran had previously been convicted of a felony (the Army vehicle ramming incident in 1993), he was not meant to own a firearm and was thus also charged with illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The other charges were use of an assault weapon during a crime of violence, destruction of U.S. property, and interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit a felony.

Duran pleaded not guilty and mounted an insanity defense, claiming that he was trying to save the world by destroying an alien &quot;mist&quot; connected by an umbilical cord to an alien in the Colorado mountains. Prosecutors argued he was faking insanity and called more than 60 witnesses to testify that Duran hated government in general and Clinton in particular. The jury deliberated for under five hours to reject the insanity defense and arrive at the guilty verdict. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison by U.S. District Court Judge Charles Robert Richey.

, Duran is serving his sentence at the high-security United States Penitentiary, Lee. The Federal Bureau of Prisons projects his release date to be 2029.

<doc id="654662" wikidata="Q728779" url="?curid=654662" title="Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador)">
<text>Belle Isle ( , ; ) is a sparsely populated island slightly more than off the coast of Labrador and slightly less than north of Newfoundland at the Atlantic entrance to the Strait of Belle Isle, which takes its name.

Named by the French explorer Jacques Cartier, the island lies on the shortest shipping lane between the Great Lakes and Europe and is on the main north-south shipping route to Hudson Bay and the Northwest Territories. The northern terminus of the International Appalachian Trail (and related Eastern Continental Trail) is on Belle Isle.

==Geography==
Belle Isle rises to about at its highest point and is in area, long and wide. It is nearly from either coast, but it is slightly closer to the Labrador side of the Strait of Belle Isle, and it has a lighthouse (supported by flying buttresses) at both its northern and its southern ends.

Officially uninhabited, the island has some seasonal occupation during fishing season.

Belle Isle is the northernmost peak of the Appalachian Mountains, which extend in various shapes over southwest to Alabama, United States.

Ice patterns show that the island lies at the meeting point of two sea currents. The Labrador Current flows from the northwest, and a smaller current, driven by dominant westerly winds, flows from the southwest. Flow lines in sea ice give a sense of the movement of the ice. Ice floes embedded in the Labrador Current appear as a relatively open pattern. Sea ice with a denser pattern enters from the strait, banking against the west side of Belle Isle.

Tendrils flow around capes at both ends of the island, with an ice-free &quot;shadow&quot; on the opposite, downstream side. Eddies off the western coast in the ice patterns, indicated by curved arrows in this photograph, show the place in which the currents interact north and west of the island.

==Climate==
Belle Isle has a marginal subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;), exceptionally cold for a coastal location so far south as the 51st parallel. As an illustration, Dunkirk on the opposite side of the Atlantic averages warmer for the year as a whole, due to the contrasting currents on the eastern and western sides of the Icelandic Low. The climate features short, cool summers and long, severely cold winters lasting most of the year. Precipitation peaks during the warmer months of June to September in the form of rain.

<doc id="654666" wikidata="Q906669" url="?curid=654666" title="Lepenski Vir">
<text>Lepenski Vir (, &quot;Lepena Whirlpool&quot;), located in Serbia, is an important archaeological site of the Lepenski Vir culture (also called as Lepenski Vir-Schela Cladovei culture). It includes Mesolithic Iron Gates Hunter-Gatherers period and transition to Early Neolithic Early European Farmers period of the Balkans. 

The latest radiocarbon and AMS data suggests that the chronology of Lepenski Vir spans between 9500/7200 and 5500 BC, divided into Early–Middle Mesolithic, Late Mesolithic, Transition and Neolithic. There is some disagreement about when the settlement and culture of Lepenski Vir began, but the latest data indicates that it was between 9500 and 7200 BC. The late Lepenski Vir (6300–6000 BC) architectural phase saw the development of unique trapezoidal buildings and monumental sculpture, related with the admixing of Iron Gates Hunter-Gatherers with newly arrived Early European Farmers. The Lepenski Vir site consists of one large settlement with around ten satellite villages. Numerous piscine sculptures and peculiar architectural remains have been found at the site. 

Archaeologist Dragoslav Srejović, who first explored the site, said that such large sculptures so early in human history, and the original architectural solutions, define Lepenski Vir as a specific and very early phase in the development of European prehistoric culture. The site was notable for its outstanding level of preservation and the overall exceptional quality of its artifacts. Because the settlement was permanent and planned, with an organized societal life, architect Hristivoje Pavlović labeled Lepenski Vir as &quot;the first city in Europe&quot;.

The Đerdap national park, which includes Lepenski Vir, was established in 1974. On 10 July 2020, the park&#x27;s wider area was designated a UNESCO global geopark. Apart from the Iron Gates  gorge, the Đerdap UNESCO Global Geopark includes parts of the Miroč and Kučaj mountain massifs, with total area of , and was the first such designation in Serbia.

== Location and geography ==
Lepenski Vir is located on the right bank of the Danube in eastern Serbia, within the Iron Gates gorge. It is situated in the village of Boljetin, near Donji Milanovac.
The view above and across the Danube is wide open and the stable and enduring terrain on the river&#x27;s bank resists the intensely erosive effects of the Danube. Stability is secured by two or three boulders at the top of the &quot;plaz&quot;, a rocky cape jutting deeply into the river. The boulders acted as a natural anchor for the terrain on which the settlement developed. Long habitation on the site was also enabled by the proximity of the great river, the natural richness of the hinterland, and the thermic benefits of the accumulated limestone cliffs (considering the ice age which had just ended). Additionally, long-term habitation was facilitated by the presumed knowledge of some birth control practices, given the limited area on which the settlement could grow, even though it is believed that parts of the settlement remain undiscovered.

Whirlpools were created by the protruding rocks, and the swirling waters are more oxygenated, richer in algae and thus abundant in fish. The whirling current makes fishing easier than in the waters which rush through the gorge. Also, the swirling water actually deposited materials on the downstream side of the &quot;plaz&quot;, known today as &quot;Katarinine Livadice&quot;, making it stronger and more stable instead of allowing the fast and strong river current to erode it. In the immediate hinterland, there is a slope known as &quot;Košo Brdo&quot;. Embedded into it is the natural stone niche or rock shelter (&quot;abij&quot;), called &quot;Lepenska Potkapina&quot;, which was explored by archaeologist .

Downstream from Lepenski Vir, in the direction of Vlasac, and half-way to the mouth of the small Boljetinka or Lepena river, the vertical high Lepena Rock rises over the river. At the foot of the rock, the Romans built a road that is today submerged at a depth of under the waters of Lake Đerdap, together with a road plaque commemorating Emperor Tiberius. The slope above the Danube between the Lepena Rock and the mouth of the Lepena river is also called Lepena, as is the bight where the slope ends.

== Discovery ==
The site was discovered on 30 August 1960, on a lot owned by a local farmer, Manojlo Milošević.

Subsequently, after almost three years of inactivity, archaeological exploration of the region was organized by the Belgrade Institute for Archaeology. Construction of the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station, which would flood the bank regions with its artificial lake, was slated to begin, so archaeologists wanted to explore the area as much as possible before that happened. The head of the project at the time was Dušanka Vučković-Todorović, a fellow at the Institute. The area to be investigated was between the villages of Prahovo and Golubac. Archaeologist Obrad Kujović explored the Lepenski Vir section with his assistant Ivica Kostić, following the work of previous visitors and archaeologists such as Felix Philipp Kanitz and Nikola Vulić. The location appeared ideal for a settlement, so Kujović and Kostić surveyed it. They found so many ceramic fragments that it was like uncovering a ceramics workshop. Kujović recognized it as an important archaeological site, collected fragments, dated them as being part of the Starčevo culture and made a report for the Institute. Srejović, intrigued by the findings, contacted Kujović in 1961 for detailed information.

== Excavations ==
Srejović managed to acquire the necessary funding and on 6 August 1965 began exploration of the site with Zagorka Letica, which continued with excavations through 1966 and 1967. Probing of the terrain in 1965 grew into protective excavations in 1966 and developed into fully systematic excavations in 1967 as they dug deeper. The cultural-archaeological layer starts below the surface layer of humus, thick.

It was only in 1967, after the discovery of the first Mesolithic sculptures, that the site&#x27;s importance was fully understood. These findings were publicly announced on 16 August 1967. The excavations ended in 1971 when the whole site was relocated higher to avoid flooding from the newly formed Đerdap Lake, created by the construction of the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station. The main exploration of this site was the work of professor Dragoslav Srejović of the University of Belgrade. Exploring up to the depth of , 136 or 138 buildings, settlements and altars were found in the initial excavations in 1965–1970. A necropolis was discovered in 1968.

== History ==

The main site comprises several archeological phases starting with Proto-Lepenski Vir, then Lepenski Vir Ia through Ie, Lepenski Vir II and Lepenski Vir III, whose occupation spanned 1,500 to 2,000 years, from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic period, when it was succeeded by the Neolithic Vinča culture and Starčevo culture, both upstream the Danube, and from Lepenski Vir, respectively. A number of satellite villages belonging to the same culture and time period were discovered in the surrounding area. These additional sites include Hajdučka Vodenica, Padina, Vlasac, Ikaona, Kladovska Skela, and others. Found artifacts include tools made from stone and bone, the remains of houses, and numerous sacral objects including unique stone sculptures.

It is assumed that the people of Lepenski Vir culture represent the descendants of the early European population of the Brno-Předmostí (Czech Republic) hunter gatherer culture from the end of the last ice age. Archeological evidence of human habitation of the surrounding caves dates back to around 20,000 BC. The first settlement on the low plateau dates back to 9500–7200 BC, a time when the climate became significantly warmer.

Trescovăț, a bare porphyritic cliff ( high) rises on the left bank of the Danube opposite Lepenski Vir like a giant sentinel of the prehistoric settlement. Trescovăț may have been important to the inhabitants of Lepenski Vir as a solar observatory. The development of the settlement was strongly influenced by the topology of the surrounding area. It sat on a narrow promontory on the bank of the river, hemmed between cliffs and the flow of the Danube. As such it offered only limited resources in terms of food, raw materials and living space. This is reflected in the findings from the earliest layer. Proto-Lepenski Vir represents only a small settlement of perhaps four or five families with a population of less than one hundred. The primary food source of the inhabitants was probably fishing. Fishing communities of this type are typical for the wider Danube valley region during this period.

In later periods, the problems of overpopulation of the settlement became evident and led to important sociological changes.

Archaeological findings in the surrounding area show evidence of temporary settlements, probably built for the purpose of hunting and gathering of food or raw materials. This suggests a complex semi-nomadic economy with managed exploitation of resources in the area not immediately surrounding the village, something remarkable in terms of the traditional view of Mesolithic people of Europe. More complexity in an economy leads to occupational specialization and thus to social differentiation.

These developments are clearly evident in the layout of the Lepenski Vir Ia-e settlement. The village was well planned. All houses were built according to a single complex geometric pattern. The remains of these houses constitute the distinct Lepenski Vir architecture. The main layout of the village is clearly visible. The dead were buried outside the village in an elaborate cemetery. The only exceptions were apparently a few notable elders who were buried behind the fireplaces (hearths) of houses.

The complex social structure was dominated by a religion which probably served as a binding force for the community and a means of coordination of activity for its members. Numerous sacral objects that were discovered in this layer support this theory. The most remarkable examples are piscine sculptures, unique to the Lepenski Vir culture, which represent one of the first examples of monumental sacral art on European soil.

Lepenski Vir gives us a rare opportunity to observe the gradual transition from the hunter-gatherer lifeways of early humans to the agricultural economy of the Neolithic. An increasingly complex social structure influenced the development of the planning and self-discipline necessary for agricultural production.

Once agricultural products became a commodity, a new way of life replaced the old social structure. Distinct characteristics of Lepenski Vir culture, such as its house architecture and piscine sculptures, gradually disappeared. Lepenski Vir III is representative of a Neolithic site and is more typical of other comparable sites across a much wider area. The exact mechanism of this transition remains unclear, but the evidence suggests development through evolution rather than invasion from without.

===Archaeogenetics===
A group of 80 institutes and 117 researchers, including archaeologists Andrej Starović and Dušan Borić from Serbia, published the results of their archaeogenetic-genomic research in &quot;Nature&quot; magazine in February 2018 (as Mathieson et al.). Genomes of 235 ancient inhabitants were studied. In terms of the area surrounding Lepenski Vir (localities of Starčevo, Saraorci-Jezava, Lepenski Vir, Padina, and Vlasac), it was established that the region&#x27;s original population, the Hunter-Gatherers, inhabited the area for an extended time. Then, starting from c.7500 BC, a new population began to settle the Balkans and the Danube valley. Evidence shows that these Neolithic newcomers mixed with the indigenous population in Lepenski Vir. Arriving from Asia Minor, the Early European Farmers had a completely different lifestyle. They brought the first grain crops, knowledge of agriculture, and the husbandry of sheep, cattle, and goats. Based on their research, Starović concluded that the blending of the populations occurred almost immediately, during the first immigrant generation, which was unique, as in other parts of Europe two such different communities would initially live in proximity to each other. He believes that this melting pot was a keystone of human development in Europe. It produced the burgeoning of the Lepenski Vir culture, establishing the Balkan Neolithic, the most original occurrence in the entire prehistory in Europe. This was the foundation of the concepts of village, square, family - which then took hold across the continent. The modern Serbian population still incorporates some 10% of their genes from this original mix.

In Mathieson et al. (2018) were analysed a male and three females from Lepenski Vir dated to 6000-5700 BC, the male carried Y-DNA haplogroup haplogroup R1b1a, while mtDNA haplogroups were HV, H13, H40, and J2b1. In a two-way autosomal DNA admixture model two were Early European Farmers (with isotope analysis showing that they were migrants that did not grow at Lepenski Vir), one of mixed Western Hunter-Gatherer-EEF and one of WHG-ancestry. Marchi et al. (2022) analysed two males samples, they had Y-DNA haplogroup C1a2b and G2a2b2a1a1c with mtDNA haplogroups K1a1 and H3v. Brami et al. (2022) re-examined and reviewed many male and females samples from the Lepenski Vir culture including from Hofmanová et al. (2017–2022), finding also Y-DNA haplogroups C2c and I2, but mtDNA haplogroups initially predominantly were U5 and H but with Neolithic transition (~ 5900 BC) prevalent became mtDNA lineages J, X, T, N1a. Autosomally it is concluded that the &quot;individuals from the Mesolithic or Proto-Lepenski Vir phase (~ 9500–7400 BC) at the eponymous site of Lepenski Vir are well modelled as 100% Iron Gates HGs, without Aegean ancestry, which arrives only after 6200 BC&quot;, and since then were admixed or 100% of Aegean-Early European Farmer ancestry.

== Localities ==
There are about 25 separate localities − including the central settlement and its satellite villages − in the Lepenski Vir-Kladovska Skela region. They were explored up until the 1980s, when the river valley was flooded after the construction of the Iron Gate I and Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Stations:

* &quot;Kula&quot; - located in the village of Mihajlovac. It was explored by archaeologist Miodrag Sladić in the 1980s, before it was flooded by Lake Đerdap II. It is a Meso-Neolithic locality, consisting of three natural layers: Kula I, Kula II (with sub-layers of II-a and II-b) and Kula III. According to the archaeologist Ivana Radovanović, Kula II is a contemporary of Lepenski Vir I and the houses at both locations are identical. The trapezoid foundations of the houses in Kula II are buried under great quantities of collapsed wall plaster.
* &quot;Lepenski Vir&quot; or simply &quot;Vir&quot;, is much more complex. It consists of four layers (Proto-Lepenski Vir, Vir I, II and III) and seven sub-layers (I-a, b, c, d, e and III-a, b). The sub-layers of Vir I are not fully and clearly differentiated. In most cases they are not separate development strata, but are defined to make an easier visual overview because the periods of intensive construction, adaptation, renovation and iterations of the settlement overlap through the layers. Vir III is the youngest layer of Lepenski Vir, belonging to the Neolithic Starčevo culture. The intermediate layer Vir II is Mesolithic, and &quot;not fully sterile&quot;, pointing to the continuity and longevity of constant settlement in Lepenski Vir. The youngest layers of Vir III were damaged when the foundations for the much later Roman watchtower were dug.

Based on an amount of anthropological changes in the skeletons, a microevolution was attested, as Srejović estimated that at least 120 generations lived in the settlement (2,000 years) while Hungarian anthropologist estimated that during the entire human habitation in Lepenski Vir, there were 240 to 280 generations, or almost 5,000 years of continual habitation. They made the distinction between the Lepenski Vir culture (1,500–2,000 years) and simple occupation of the same habitat (5,000 years).

== Architecture ==

Seven successive settlements were discovered on the Lepenski Vir site, with the remains of 136 residential and sacral buildings dating from 9500/7200 BC to 6000 BC.

The layout of the houses, which are on an inclined promontory that opens to the river, is terrace-like and spread in a fan-shaped arrangement, allowing access to the river by people from houses further from the bank. As for the tools used for the construction works, not many have survived, or the ones that have are not recognized as such. Apart from the human instinct for best use of space and for a &quot;pleasing to the eye&quot; sense in architecture, it is quite possible that Lepenians possessed certain forms of knowledge in this area that we would not usually attribute to or expect from people of that era. Such knowledge may have atrophied over time as their society didn&#x27;t survive and left no written documents. Mostly burned deer antlers were discovered, but it is believed that, in order to render the trapezoid shape of both the plateau and the houses they must have used sticks, tightening of ropes, vertical rods, etc., or natural features, such as shadows.

=== Houses ===
The history of architecture still provides no definite answer as to which is older: the house (as a habitat) or the temple (as a shrine). In Lepenski Vir, it appears that there was a process of gradual desacralization, meaning that the shrines were converted into houses over time. The houses from the Vir I period are marked with Arabic numerals, while those from the Vir II with Roman numerals. For example, houses 61 and 65, from Vir I were superimposed by houses XXXIV and XXXV, from Vir II.

All the settlements follow the shape of the underlying terrain, a horseshoe-shaped area of land. Settlements always face in the direction of the river, which was the obvious focus of life for its inhabitants. The basic layout of the settlement consists of two separate wings and a wide empty central space which served as a village square or meeting place. The settlement is radially divided with numerous pathways leading to the edge of the river. The outer edges of the village are parallel to the surrounding cliffs.

Domestic objects mark the transition from tent structure to house. All the houses share a very distinct shape, built according to a complex geometric pattern. The basis of each of the houses is a circle segment of exactly 60 degrees, constructed in the manner of an equilateral triangle. The tip of the trapezoid base, a shape previously unknown in human settlements, faces into the wind (košava). The shape of the house base is original and not recorded in any other locality. The material used for the floors is the local limestone clay, which, when mixed with animal dung and ash, hardens like concrete. As a result, the floors are in almost perfect condition. On the edges of the floors there are remnants of the stone reinforcements which served as supports for the upper construction elements, indicating that the houses were covered. The roofing material was some easily degradable material or was similar to the surrounding loess, making it indistinguishable from the loess found during the excavations. The plaster, a reddish muddy clay, is still abundant in the region. In the village of Boljetin there are still several houses plastered with it. The material is called &quot;lep&quot;, hence the name of the locality, &quot;Lepenski Vir&quot;, or literally &quot;red clay whirlpool&quot;. Even today, brandy-producing cauldrons, called &quot;lepenac&quot;, are still being used. They are made of wood, but plastered with the red loam, which is also used by the local swallows to harden their nests. As for the structures which covered the houses, their appearance is not known. They may have resembled the modern brandy cauldron − wood covered with red clay − or they have used wattle instead of proper wood.

According to Srejović, the planned design of the settlement, with its functionality and proportionality, shows an almost modern architectural sense. Despite the millennia which separate then from now, the architectural plan of the settlement seems contemporary and fully recognizable to us today, while architect Bogdan Bogdanović has said that &quot;everything, absolutely everything, to the smallest detail&quot; about the Lepenski Vir, has enormous importance.

The houses are completely standardized in design, but vary widely in size. The smallest of the houses have an area of while the largest one covers .

Pit-houses appear in the early periods Vir III-a and III-b, which already corresponds to the Starčevo culture, though some can also be found in the oldest period, Proto-Vir. By digging to the level of the frost line, which is in this area no more than deep, the natural, constant temperature of the ground can be utilized. The walls of the dugout were plastered with mud which was then dried and hardened with fire. The clay was hardened to such an extent that architect Radmilo Petrović managed to remove the complete clay coverings intact, like giant clay bowls out of their mold.

Another reason for digging the houses into the ground is the inclination of the terrain on which they were built, which is 11 degrees. In other localities, the conditions were different. At Vlasac, for example, the natural, funnel-shaped gullies were adapted into the houses.

==== House 49 ====
House 49 is the smallest of all, and considered to be the most intriguing. The majority of researchers believe that this house was the prototype for the entire settlement. The hearth in this house is also the smallest, no larger than a shoe. Still, evidence shows that it was used for fire.

==== House XLIV ====
The large house 57, from the Vir I-e period, is overlaid with house XLIV from the Vir II, which covers , making it the largest discovered house. It was obviously very important for the settlement, not just because of its size, but due to the location (it was nicknamed the &quot;Central House&quot;) and the fact that its floor lapidarium yielded, depending on the source, 7-9 sculptures, more than any other house (17% out of the total of 52 sculptures). When the location was flooded, the study envisioned that the &quot;flood line&quot; would cross right through this house, which would have allowed for further explorations, but the suggestion was ignored and the flood line was breached when the reservoir was formed. The most representative sculptures were discovered in this house, such as the &quot;Praroditeljka&quot; (&quot;Foremother&quot;), Danubius, &quot;Praotac&quot; (&quot;Forefather&quot;), &quot;Rodonačelnik&quot; (&quot;Progenitor&quot;), and &quot;Vodena vila&quot; (&quot;Water fairy&quot;).

=== Interior ===
The interior of each house includes a fireplace (hearth) in the form of an elongated rectangle situated on the long axis of the floor plan. These fireplaces were built from massive rectangular stone blocks. The fireplaces are further extended with stone blocks to create a kind of small shrine in the back of the house. These shrines were always decorated with sculptures carved from massive round river stones and represent perhaps river gods or ancestors. Another significant feature of the houses is a shallow circular depression in the ground located precisely in middle of the floor. This may represent some type of altar.

The sculptures, fireplaces, altars, tables, arranged square stones, round depressions and intriguing triangles were all built (&quot;concreted&quot;) into the hardened porphyritic floors. In all the houses they are in almost the same basic layout, which resembles the human figure. Scientists still disagree on the purpose of the artifacts, except that the fireplaces were indeed used for the fire. Still, the actual function is not clear. Archaeologist described them as a &quot;cult pit&quot; or eventually a &quot;ritual fireplace&quot;. In 1968, architect Peđa Ristić expressed doubt that this was a simple fireplace. He asserted that the rectangular shape of the fireplace is impractical, with a poor capability of conducting the smoke away. However, when he was working on the reconstruction of the houses, Ristić concluded that probably every house had a spit, which explains the elongated shape of the fireplace pit. also was skeptical about the purpose of the fireplace. He focused rather on the triangles, which he claimed represented the ancient archetype of a writing system. This is not supported by recent science, and they are still being considered as symbols, not proto-letters. Pešić also concluded, since the symbols spread from the fireplace in a sequence that can&#x27;t be deciphered, that it was actually a sacrificial altar and called the entire complex of artifacts a &quot;fire altar&quot;.

Archaeologist Ljubinka Babović accepted Srejović&#x27;s theory that the layout within the house represents the human figure, but she believed that the figure is actually an anthropomorphized representation of the Sun, with added hands. She asserted that every house was actually a small Sun shrine and that plan of the settlement represents the astronomical movement of the Sun. She referred to the round stones as &quot;ash holes&quot;, because ash was discovered in the round depressions. Philologist originally concluded that this ash hole, cornered by the rectangular stones, was the fireplace, following Pešić&#x27;s idea, but later changed his opinion, accepting the general consensus that the rectangular depression in the center is the proper fireplace. Archaeologist wrote of the &quot;unusual stone fireplaces for complex ritual purposes&quot;. Srejović also made the semantic distinction between the inner fireplace, &quot;ognjište&quot;, and the outer one, &quot;vatrište&quot;. Excavations on the locality Vlasac point to the gradual transformation from &quot;vatrište&quot; to &quot;ognjište&quot;, or bringing the fire inside the houses. Regardless of which of the depressions are the proper fireplace, it is evident that the human-like floor installation comprises several elements, which are connected by some, still undeciphered, functional relationships, as well as by visual and artistic ones.

==== Central installation ====
A pebble stone, placed in the geometrical center of the house and part of the floor installation representing the &quot;head&quot; of the perceived figure, is also variously explained. As it has a dent in it, it was suggested that it served as a primitive lamp, the so-called &quot;Magdalene lamp&quot;, a rushlight with a wick made of moss. The dent was conceivably made so that grease or tallow could be placed in it. Ristić opposed the theory saying that no evidence of fat or burning have been discovered in any of the stones. He called the stones &quot;upretnik&quot; (&quot;resistance stone&quot;) and believed their function was to serve as the foundation for the sticks or pillars, which held the covering construction of the house. During his reconstruction of the house, he used it for exactly that purpose. Another idea is that it was used as a pouring vessel (for honey, etc.) which was used during rituals. One proposed theory that it was used a grindstone was rejected as this was still in the pre-harvesting period. However, it may have been used for grinding wild seeds or aromatic herbs. The stones have curious engravings in the lower section. As the stones were &quot;cemented&quot; into the floor, the engravings couldn&#x27;t be observed by the living from above ground, so it is suggested that they were meant for the dead, which were sometimes buried under the floor of the house. Babović described the floors as a &quot;border between day and night&quot;.

The central piece of the central section, the &quot;body&quot;, was a hearth which has been the subject of scientific controversy. It was definitely used for fire, as evidence of burning and ash is found. It was elongated, in the proportion of 1:3 or 1:4, and surrounded by stones. In the older periods, thin stones were used, later thicker ones and in the end, quite rough and irregular stones, even though the geometry remained refined. It is suggested that the size of the fireplace is actually used as an etalon, a measurement module for the proportions of the house. Ristić said that the length of the fireplace is equal to the length of the spit, calculating that this length is the radius of the circumscribed circle which is the base of the house. Based on the measurements in 51 houses, it was established that the average fire cavity is long and wide, which gives the ratio 1:3.25. Average width is another reason why some archaeologists believe that this wasn&#x27;t a proper fireplace, it being too narrow and impractical. The depth of the hole varies from , but at least one quarter of those have sloping bottoms. In these cases, the section closer to the entrance of the house is lower. The overall size of the fireplaces varies, depending on the size of the house, but it appears to be more balanced than the sizes of the houses. The smallest fireplace is , while the largest are in House 54 () and House 37 .

Around the fireplace the larger stones were placed, sometimes in two levels. They are variously called &quot;stone tables&quot;, &quot;sacrificial plates&quot;, &quot;market stalls&quot; or &quot;hands&quot;. The stones were already embedded when the red plaster was poured. In the later period of the Lepenski Vir I phase, there are a smaller number of stones around the hole, or they disappear altogether. In their place triangles appear which encircle the fireplace in an ellipsoid arrangement. They have been called simply triangles but also &quot;triangular forms&quot;, &quot;fireplace triangles&quot; or &quot;forks&quot;. Apart from Pešić&#x27;s generally unsupported interpretation that they are a form of proto-writing, the triangles have been variously described as the &quot;little houses for the dead&quot;, support for the spit&#x27;s skewers, openings for the pouring of drinks and food for the dead buried under the floor, support for the construction of some larger stove-like object above the fireplace, symbols of light or fire, or simply vents for the heat from the fire. In all cases but one, the tips of the triangle are oriented towards the fireplace. The exception occurs in the locality of Kula. The prototype of the triangles appears to be the mandible of a female human, traversed with a small stone plate, which is pressed into the floor in House 40.

The &quot;legs&quot; of the installation extend almost to the outside of the house. The round depression, which also can&#x27;t be definitively explained (fireplace, ash hollow, etc.) is in this section, and is equally accessible from both the inside and outside as it is situated at the entrance to the house. In the literature, it is also referred to as &quot;(slanted) stone doorsteps&quot; or simply &quot;entrance&quot;. Babović noticed that there are several variants of it, which prompted her to classify the houses (or shrines, as she called them) into 4 categories. The categories are:

* &quot;free step&quot;; when slanted stones were placed like two spread legs;
* &quot;tied step&quot;; when slanted stones are placed in the same way as in &quot;free step&quot;, but additional stones were placed on the open side to make the connection between the slanted stones, creating a shallow triangular or trapezoidal depression;
* &quot;movement in the stationary status&quot;; no slanted stones, but the entrance was paved with the stone slabs, forming an almost fortification-like obstacle at the entrance; there is no depression and the installation appears to be a sitting platform;
* &quot;latent quiescence&quot;; absence of any stone construction at the entrance; some researchers suggest that this is actually not a separate type but rather an indication that this part of the house may not have been covered, so that the elements eroded the stone over time. An additional influence may be that the outer hearth was right outside so the heating and cooling affected the stones.

In the Neolithic, or Starčevo phase of Lepenski Vir, the Lepenians began building dome-shaped furnaces in the houses. They were built on the floor and made from compacted earth, with the horseshoe-shaped foundations made of crushed stone. The calotte, or the dome of the furnace was made of baked earth. The hut which was built on the most elevated section of the settlement&#x27;s terrain and was positioned almost in the center of it, had the largest furnace, . Some researchers believe that due to its size and position, it was probably built for communal use, but they have also pointed out that its proportions equal those of the &quot;prototype house&quot;, House 49. It also has been suggested that the furnace from Lepenski Vir was a prototype for building of other furnaces, due to the archetypical uniformity of bread ovens in the wider Balkan area, as well as the canonical repetition of the same shape from the Neolithic to the modern age.

=== Outer fireplace ===
The outer fireplace was almost a continuation of the internal central installation. Placed at the entrance, it also functioned as an obstacle (&quot;fire serving as a door&quot;). It probably served as protection against wild animals, but also for heating the house. The internal fireplace was too small for that purpose, and wood had to be cut and prepared for its small size. On the other hand, simply by bringing wood from the nearby abundant forests or utilizing large logs brought by the Danube into the bay, they would have been able to maintain large fires outside the houses. A ritualistic significance for the outer fire&#x27;s location has also been proposed (keeping the shadows inside the house, ritualistic bypassing of the fire when entering the house, fire as the entrance into the world of the spirits, etc.). Srejović pointed out that location of the outer fireplace was actually quite logical, given the likely outlook of the inhabitants at that time. &quot;The only building materials the Lepenians had was being used to replicate life in a cave...so their houses had a cave-like atmosphere&quot;. Cave dwellers also light fires at the entrances to the caves; otherwise they would be asphyxiated. The memory of cave dwelling was probably still vivid at the time, as there were contemporaneous humans in other parts of Europe still living in caves or natural shelters. The existence of a large outer fireplace along with and an apparently not very practical internal one, prompted Pavlović to conclude that the small hole in the house floor actually served to hold and maintain the fire or ember, which developed over time into a ritual. He compared it to the way the Pythian priestesses kept the fire at Delphi.

=== Reconstructions ===
The remains of the settlements in Lepenski Vir abide by the universal rules of architecture, so the architectural remains should be perceived and evaluated by those rules. However, the reconstruction of Lepenski Vir &quot;resembles a gigantic, complex jigsaw puzzle, without an exemplar picture&quot;.

Science still has no definitive answer as to what the houses looked like above ground and numerous ideas have been proposed by architects, urbanists, historians and anthropologists. Vojislav Dević suggested a long, intertwined arch-like wattle (&quot;fish skeleton&quot;) while Živojin Andrejić opted for transversal arches. Diagonally crisscrossed arches, with one wide at the entrance to prevent a bottleneck, were proposed by Pavlović. Srejović originally distanced himself from any of the proposed reconstructions, considering all of them flawed in some way. In his 1969 book he did print the reconstruction of Đorđe Mitrović, however his text differed greatly from the illustration. The concept was judged by some as clumsy, primitive, technically impossible and, simply, wrong. Even so, the drawings became internationally known. Srejović again distanced himself saying that such roof construction was too primitive for the perfectly shaped base, adding that we should allow for additional, still unknown elements which may have enabled a completely different construction. In 1973 he also rejected Ristić&#x27;s reconstruction, claiming that none of the proposed solutions so far seemed definitive and that every idea had some incorrect details. He asserted that any final solution would not do justice to the imagination of the creators, and that it would take generations to resolve the problem. Later, in 1980, Ristić received his PhD from the University of Graz on the subject &quot;Reconstructions of the prehistoric architecture in Lepenski Vir&quot;.

Borislav Jovanović, who explored the Padina location, attempted a reconstruction employing a basic &quot;three-stick hut&quot; arrangement. The &quot;official&quot;, Mitrović&#x27;s version, after many changes and adaptations became technically possible by the time of the opening of the visitor center in Lepenski Vir, in 2011. The main problem was the relation of the inclinations of the roof surface and the purlin. Marija Jovin and Siniša Temerinski, from the Institute for the protection of the monuments, created a model based on the pronounced inclination of the purlin, removal of the central pillar and a change in the direction of the roof carrier. In this way, the concept of a slender, elongated construction was achieved, which allowed efficient conduction of smoke to the outside. It was based on an older version of the simple tripod by Velizar Ivić and a more complex variant of Petar Đorđević, who worked on the excavation on the Padina location. Bojana Mihajlović and Andrej Starović from the National Museum in Belgrade created a holographic animation of the house based on the &quot;shallow&quot; purlin and with animal hides on the roof instead of pieces of wood. In complete contrast was the holographic version of the house by Borić. In the later period of explorations on the Vlasac locality, Borić constructed his version of a house on location, but it contains vertical walls which appeared much later in architecture. Some other proposed reconstructions were deemed even less possible as they included the orthogonal base or upper floor, based on the assumption that stony, garland-like reinforcements are actually remains of the former stone walls. Almost all proposed reconstructions, regardless of differences, belong to the pyramidal or tent-like type (even though they are shaped like frustums).

== Burials ==
Some of the dead were buried in the houses under the exceptionally preserved floors. They are believed to be prominent members of the group but there are also some skeletons of children.

Srejović believed that the Lepenians developed the &quot;cult of the head&quot;, which is why all discovered sculptures are actually head busts. The ritual burials included a curious practice of removing the skull from the head, then the mandible from the skull before they were all buried separately. Skulls were placed in special stone structures. A skull would be placed on a larger stone slab then protected by crushed stones. All separately buried skulls are male, while all the mandibles are female.

Graves were built into the bases of the houses. Best preserved is the skeleton from House 69. Because of the excellent condition of the skeleton and its apparent height, archaeologist Aleksandar Bačkalov, who discovered it, thought it was quite &quot;handsome&quot; or &quot;dashing&quot; and named it Valentino, after the American actor, Rudolph Valentino. Bačkalov discovered it in a shallow dig which originates from the Proto-Vir, or Vir I-a period. Valentino died c. 8200 BC and architect Goran Mandić worked on his facial reconstruction. The position of the skeletons buried under the floors is such that above the genitals are the widening parts of the central installation, which prompted some researches to conclude that it actually symbolizes birth, regardless of the skeleton&#x27;s sex, and that the posture of the skeleton, the so-called &quot;Turkish style&quot; represents the childbirth position.

Ash also had some ritual significance, as ceramic vessels filled with ash were also discovered.

Valentino was used a model for the interactive 3D facial reconstruction, as part of the Serbian pavilion at the Expo 2020 in Dubai. The team headed by physical anthropologist who reconstructed the face of the 10,000-year-old human, with help from experts in osteology, DNA and forensics, using the metaverse technology, used in gaming. Stefanović heads the project called &quot;Digital ancient people&quot;. They estimated that Valentino was 55 years old, tall, and weighing . The entire Serbian pavilion was designed after the presumed slanted roofs of the Lepenski Vir houses, and decorated with their sculptures replicas.

== Sculptures ==
The Lepenski Vir sculptures consist of numerous prehistoric figurines dating from 7000 BC found intact at Lepenski Vir. The earliest sculptures found on the site date to the time of the Lepenski Vir I-b settlement. They are present in all the subsequent layers until the end of the distinct Lepenski Vir culture. All the sculptures were carved from round sandstone cobbles found on the river banks.

The sculptures can be classified into two distinct categories: one with simple geometric patterns and the other representing humanoid figures. The latter is the more interesting. All of the sculptures were modeled in a strongly expressionistic manner. Only the head and face of the human figures were modeled realistically, with strong brow arches, an elongated nose, and a wide, fish-like mouth. Hair, beard, arms, and hands can be seen on some of the figures in a stylized form. Many fish-like features are evident. Along with the position these sculptures had in the house shrine, they suggest a connection with river gods.

The sculptures were components of the house itself, as they were built into the stone flooring. They are the oldest group (&quot;portrait&quot;) of sculptures discovered so far. Though the sculptures are no more than in length, they are considered historically &quot;monumental&quot;, as no older sculptures of this size have so far been discovered. Other sculptures from the same period, such as in Asia Minor and Palestine, are smaller. Also, unlike other sculptures from that period which have carved noses and eyes, the ones in Lepenski Vir have mouths and ears.

Art historian and professor at the University of Belgrade Lazar Trifunović said that the sculptures look like &quot;they were made by Henry Moore&quot;.

Some of the sculptures became popular following media attention in the 1980s. In their book &quot;The Art of Lepenski Vir&quot; from 1983, Srejović and Babović individually described some of them. Probably the best known is the &quot;Praroditeljka&quot;, or &quot;Foremother&quot;, pictured above right. , the image is often exploited in the media and became a symbol of Lepenski Vir. Srejović and Babović considered it &quot;impressive&quot;, a possible embodiment of the female principle of the fishlike beings. She is thought to be equal to the opposite, male version, &quot;Danubius&quot;. Female elements and attributes appear canonical, symmetrical, rigid and though shaped like a figure, eventually quite reduced. She has two vents on her shoulders. Traces of the original red coating pigment are still visible. Another sculpture is likewise essential, as it is the first known portrait-type sculpture larger than a human head in human history. Named &quot;Rodonačelnik&quot;, or &quot;Progenitor&quot;, it represents a head and measures . Considered a type of totem, it appears more human- than fish-like. It has been described as &quot;mysterious and lonely&quot;. The red pigment remnants on the eye bags and on the neck.

== Controversies ==
Though Obrad Kujović discovered the locality first, it is Dragoslav Srejović who is today recognized as the man who discovered Lepenski Vir. In his publication &quot;Lepenski Vir&quot; from 1969, he mentions &quot;a group of experts&quot; who noticed the locality before him &quot;at the end of the summer of 1960&quot;, but never gave their names, while he mentioned many other people who helped with the excavations. In 1979, the daily Večernje Novosti published an interview with Kujović who repeated the story of how he had discovered the location. He added that &quot;for the scientific exploration and interpretation of the discovered materials&quot; the glory rightfully belongs to Srejović, but objected that Srejović never mentioned the people who discovered it. Srejović replied that he accepts the Kujović&#x27;s claim and that it is important to recognize the exact date of discovery for such an important site. He added that he omitted their names as they were hired and paid (by the Institute of Archaeology) to survey the terrain. However, in 1996 a 30th anniversary of the discovery of Lepenski Vir was organized. Kujović publicly asked Srejović if he already acknowledged that the discovery happened in 1960, why he didn&#x27;t organize the 35th anniversary. Srejović died later that year.

=== Conspiracy theories ===
As the concept of an &quot;architecturally modern&quot; settlement and its culture seemed so disconnected from accepted knowledge on the subject at the time, fringe theories on the civilization of Lepenski Vir developed. Ufologists believed that the Lepenians were actually aliens from outer space. Such conspiracy theories also existed in Russia, while one of the proponents of the ancient astronauts theory, Erich von Däniken, showed interest in the locality.

== Archaeoastronomy ==

The first archaeoastronomical surveys were conducted during the winter solstice in 2014. They pointed to the possibility of a &quot;double sunrise&quot; occurring during the summer solstice. The volcanic hill Trescovăț, which is located across the Danube from Lepenski Vir, has a rocky outcropping near the top and an inclination higher than the inclination of the Sun&#x27;s apparent orbit. The Sun appears above Trescovăț, then goes behind the outcropping and reappears again. The phenomenon was observed and confirmed during the summer solstice of 2015. The entire passage, which was filmed, lasts slightly over 4 minutes. Scientific literature mentions two archaeological locations in Great Britain where a &quot;double sunset&quot; has been observed during the solstices, but a &quot;double sunrise&quot; has not been recorded. As the axial tilt has changed since then, a geospatial analysis was conducted using the GPS, which proved that the &quot;double sunrise&quot; occurred at that time as well, and that it was visible from the original location of Lepenski Vir.

The phenomenon was investigated by Pavlović and Aleksandra Bajić, who published their findings in 2016 book &quot;The Sun of Lepenski Vir&quot;. As only the specific position of the Sun during the winter and summer solstices was necessary to calculate the time using a reference point which repeats after one year, they believe that Lepenians used the &quot;double sunrise&quot; as a basis for some kind of a solar calendar which dated to 6300–6200 BC. As Lepenski Vir was a sedentary community for several millennia, Pavlović and Bajić hold that the inhabitants must have observed the phenomenon, especially since people were then much more observant of natural phenomena than they are today. Even Srejović, who died in 1996 and was unaware of the phenomenon, said that, based on the geographical configuration of the gorge, the &quot;dance of light and shadows occasionally reach the levels of hierophany&quot;. The terrain was further surveyed by theodolite, and an astrogeodetic analysis was conducted in 2017. The results show that the &quot;double sunrise&quot; was visible from the northernmost part of the settlement. Viewed from the southernmost part, the summer solstice Sun rose on the southern part of the flattened top of Trescovăț. So, the whole settlement was accurately measured with respect to the astronomical event.

== Relocation ==
The Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station became operational between 1970 and 1972, when the artificial Đerdap Lake was formed. The lake was to flood the original site so it was almost entirely removed to another location which was first confirmed to be &quot;archaeologically sterile&quot;. The new location is approximately downstream and higher than the previous one, and is less approachable from the river, due to the scree accumulation on the bank and excess dirt from the preparation of the new site. The greater part of the discovered settlement, which consists of almost all houses from the Vir I period, was relocated in 1971. As the Danube now passes above the natural rocky &quot;anchors&quot; which previously caused it to whirl, it took only 10 years for the river to dislodge and wash away portions of the old bank and to undermine the old location, already weakened by the archaeological excavations.

The old location of Lepenski Vir itself is below the present level of the lake, while the localities of Vlasac and Padina are and below, respectively. Archaeologists (Srejović, Branislav Ćirić, Milka Čanak Medić, etc.) prepared a study entitled &quot;The Relocation Project&quot; on preserving and protecting the bank, especially preventing landslides, but the study was largely ignored.

The vicinity of Lepenski Vir was never fully excavated. Srejović himself said that there is &quot;more of Lepenski Vir, both up and down&quot;, meaning below the Proto-Vir, and further into the hinterland. The Proto-Vir layer is completely flooded, while some of the Vir I excavations weren&#x27;t relocated, e.g., the houses which occupied the most elevated section of the plateau (houses 61, 65, 66, 67), though they were also flooded. In general, the material remains of the cultures in the Iron Gate Gorge were almost all flooded and forever lost to further scientific research.

== Assessment ==
The findings of the Lepenski Vir study, published for the first time on 16 August 1967 at a press conference organized by Lazar Trifunović, radically reenvisioned the history of Europe. It was noted that the printing of some history textbooks was delayed so that they could be revised. Opposing voices, however, claimed that Lepenski Vir can&#x27;t be dated to the Mesolithic, as Europe was barely inhabited at the time and the population lived in caves and other natural shelters.

The research issues that Lepenski Vir presents are typical of similar archaeological sites from prehistoric periods: without written evidence and because of the absence of wider context, excessively broad conclusions tend to be extrapolated from a quite narrow base of information. Incomplete data diverts the exploration and analysis of Lepenski Vir into diffuse directions. Classicist Milan Budimir described the findings as &quot;bold hypotheses which shed a dubious light on the (historical) dark&quot;.

Yet, Lepenski Vir is the oldest planned settlement in Europe and has unique, trapezoidal-shaped houses seen nowhere else. Its culture has yielded not only the earliest discovered portrait sculptures, but also the first sculptures larger than life-size in the history of human art. The sculptures are the largest up to that period and among the first to have a carved mouth or ears. Additionally, the skeletal remains from Lepenski Vir comprise almost half of one of the largest Mesolithic anthropological series, and are important for the future bio-archaeological and DNA research.

By 26 May 1966, the State Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments had already protected Lepenski Vir as a cultural monument (Decision 554/1), expanding the level of protection on 3 February 1971 (Decision 01-10/21). In 1979 Lepenski Vir was declared a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance (State Gazette, No. 14/79). Despite its immense importance, However, Lepenski Vir has not yet been nominated for the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List. 
This was partially due to the bureaucracy of the state and certain technicalities, and partially because the Museum of Lepenski Vir had to be finished first. Another problem may be the fact that the original location of the site has been flooded, and the site elevated to higher ground. Houses 61 and 65 were not moved and at the low water level, they are only below the surface, so technically, they could be nominated for the UNESCO listing.

Architect Branislav Krstić (1922–2016), a former commissioner UNESCO commissioner, suggested in 2010 that Lepenski Vir should be nominated together with the entire Iron Gates Gorge, as an &quot;integral cultural and natural monument&quot;. As Krstić stated, apart from the ancient cultures, the wider area of Lepenski Vir was later part of the Roman, and later Byzantine, Danubian Limes, contains Roman and mediaeval fortresses, like Golubac Fortress and Fetislam, while the massive Iron Gates Dam is a monument to industrialization and electrification in the 20th century. Ristić opposed this course of action, saying that the original, &quot;crystal clear&quot; artifacts (sculptures) should be separated from the architectural remains which were ruined, partially because of the submergence and partially because of &quot;catastrophic archaeological mismanagement during the 1960s excavations&quot;. He asserted that the architectural remains were fragile to begin with, and that during the excavations it was only partially presented but totally destroyed during the relocation. Architect and artist Aleksandar Deroko called it the &quot;largest cultural massacre of the 20th century&quot; and said that &quot;world-renowned scientists will no longer be able to explore the site&quot;. The elevated and reconstructed section in the museum was to be relocated by a project, led by Milorad Medić, which envisioned the relocation of entire house floors in steel frames. During the relocation, however, the fragile floors crumbled into pieces and dust, so they were moved in parts and then reassembled in the museum. Ristić believes that the focus should be on the sculptures, which are fully preserved: &quot;Just as the cave paintings (in Lascaux) revealed the soul of the Paleolithic man from 20,000-30,000 years ago, so the pebble sculpting (in Lepenski Vir) reveal the soul of the Mesolithic man from 7,000-9,000 years ago&quot;. He denounced the museum as being an &quot;incomplete forgery...that possesses neither soul nor science, and has no purpose&quot;. He concluded that Lepenski Vir, due to its importance, deserves a fitting monument, a counterpart to the monumental cliff sculpture of the face of Decebalus, leader of the Dacians from the 1st century. He proposed that Serbian counterpart should be a gigantic face from the Lepenian sculptures, which would appear to arise out of the Danube, and that Lepena Rock, halfway between Lepenski Vir and Vlasac, would be a suitable site for the monument.

<text>Nitro is a steel roller coaster located at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township, New Jersey. Manufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, the Hyper Coaster model opened to the public on April 7, 2001. Since its debut, Nitro has consistently ranked high among steel coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards from &quot;Amusement Today&quot;, peaking in third place during its tenure.

==History==
In August 2000, land preparation of a new attraction began right behind some maintenance buildings. Several concrete footers were being poured in September. The construction was visible from the patio of the Captain Jack&#x27;s restaurant. Workers continued to work in the forest and the shores of Prospertown Lake. Vertical construction began in December 2000 and the new attraction would cover of land.

On February 1, 2001, Six Flags Great Adventure confirmed that the new attraction would be named Nitro and be a hypercoaster. The ride would be the third Bolliger &amp; Mabillard roller coaster at the park, with the other two being and Medusa. Billed as the most explosive coaster on the planet, it would be the largest single investment in 27 years.

Nitro was completed on time, opening to the general public at the start of the 2001 season on April 7. Four days later on April 11, the park hosted a special event. Former WWE wrestler Mick Foley slid down the handle of a detonator as fireworks exploded above the queue line and one of the trains exited the station.

==Ride experience==
===Layout===
After leaving the station, the train makes a left U-turn and ascends a lift hill. After cresting the top, the train drops at a 68-degree angle, reaching a maximum speed of . The train then ascends a hill and dives down to the left, coasting over another large airtime hill. Afterwards, Nitro enters an element known as a hammerhead turn, a tight U-turn, which veers to the right. Traveling over another camelback hill, Nitro enters its S-curve and into the 540-degree helix. After the mid course brake run, Nitro travels over three camelback hills, followed by a final brake run before returning to the station.

===Trains===

Nitro operates with three open-air steel and fiberglass trains with individual lap bar restraints. Each train has nine cars with riders arranged four across in a single row for a total of 36 riders per train.

===Track===
The steel track is in length and the height of the lift is approximately . It was manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators located in Batavia, Ohio.

==Incidents==

In the summer of 2014, on a Friday afternoon, Nitro passengers found themselves stuck part way up the first 233-foot high hill of the ride. Six Flags park officials say a power outage to the ride was to blame. No one was injured as a result of the stoppage.  Ride operators climbed up, helped the passengers out of their seats, and down the stairs, NBC News reported.

On Sunday, July 11, 2021, Nitro was temporarily suspended after a complaint was made that a restraining lap bar had unfastened on one of the trains. Following this guest concern, the ride was closed for a few hours. After the three coaster trains were thoroughly inspected by Six Flags&#x27; maintenance team and the ride was found to be operating without any safety concerns regarding the lap bar situation, Nitro was reopened with the other two trains.

<doc id="654676" wikidata="Q2559945" url="?curid=654676" title="Paul Bouts">
<text>Paul Bouts (1900–1999) was a Belgian phrenologist and pedagogue. Born in the province of Limburg, he was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1926.

In the pedagogic environment of the Normal School (pedagogic academy) of Tienen, Belgium, where he taught from 1924, he specialised in characterological studies and devised a new method of characterological analysis, which he called Psychognomy and which was largely based on the pseudoscience of phrenology, combined with typology and graphology. This led to his life-work, &quot;La Psychognomie&quot;, initially published in Paris by the &quot;Librairie philosophique Alcan&quot;. It was subsequently translated in Dutch and Portuguese.
The theories of Bouts were further developed in specialised institutes which were founded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Chicoutimi, Québec.
Bouts continued his research in the field with the paleo-anthropological work &quot;Les Grandioses Destinées Individuelle et Humaine dans la Lumière de la Caractérologie et de l&#x27;Evolution cérébro-cranienne&quot;. In this work he developed a teleological and orthogenetical view on a &quot;perfecting evolution&quot;, from the paleo-encephalical skull shapes of prehistoric man, which he considered still prevalent in criminals and, in his view, &quot;savages&quot;.

After the Second World War, Bouts experienced serious health problems, due to overburdening. These enticed him to study a healthy lifestyle, which he described in his work &quot;Modern Hygiene of Intellectuals&quot; (published in French as &quot;Hygiène Moderne des Intellectuels&quot;, and in Dutch under the title &quot;Ik ben nooit moe&quot;, i.e. &quot;I am never tired&quot;). He underlined the importance of wholesome, healthy food and of the maintenance of respiratory capacity through exercise. The adoption of this healthy lifestyle allowed him to regain full strength and to lead a productive life until age 99.

In 1967 he established himself on the woody Middelberg hill in Rotselaar, Belgium (in Flemish Brabant, 35 km east of Brussels), where he built the &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Home&quot;, as well as a reform shop called &quot;Sol &amp; Vita&quot;. He continued to publish a number of spiritual works, like &quot;Onze overheerlijke lotsbestemming, het Paradijs&quot; (&quot;Paradise, our marvellous destiny&quot;, in Dutch).

Paul Bouts is also keeper of several inventor&#x27;s patents.

<text>Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll or Archibald &quot;the Red&quot; Campbell (c. 1507 – 1558), was a Scottish nobleman and politician.

==Biography==
Archibald Campbell was the eldest son of Colin Campbell, 3rd Earl of Argyll (died 1529) and Lady Jean Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly. Immediately after succeeding as Earl of Argyll and to the offices of his father, in October 1529, he was put in command of an expedition to quell an insurrection in the southern Scottish Isles. The voluntary submission of the main chiefs resulted; and Alexander MacDonald of Dunnyveg, a prime mover in the insurrection, was able to convince King James V of Scotland that he was personally well disposed to the government. More than that, MacDonald argued that the disturbances in the Isles were chiefly because the Earls of Argyll had made use of the office of lieutenant over the Isles, for their own personal aggrandizement. Archibald was therefore summoned before the King to give an account of the duties and rental of the Isles, received by him; and, as the result of the inquiry, he was committed for a time to prison. Shortly afterwards, he was liberated, but was deprived of his offices, and they were not restored to him until after the death of King James V.

In a charter of 28 April 1542, Archibald Campbell was called &quot;master of the king&#x27;s wine cellar&quot;. Along with the Earl of Huntly and the Earl of Moray, he was named one of the Council of the Scottish Monarchy in the document which Cardinal Beaton produced as the will of King James V, and which also appointed Beaton governor of the Kingdom and guardian to the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, daughter and heir of King James. After the arrest of Beaton, on 20 January 1543, Archibald retired to his own lands to muster a force in order to maintain the struggle against James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, who had been chosen governor. Shortly afterwards, the Earls of Argyll, Huntly, Moray, and the Earl of Bothwell, supported by many of the barons and landed gentry, as well as by the bishops and abbots, assembled at Perth, vowing their determination to resist the measures of the governor. On being summoned by the governor to disperse, they did not resist; but when it became known that King Henry VIII of England had succeeded in arranging a treaty of marriage between the young queen Mary and his son, Prince Edward Tudor, the Earls of Argyll, Huntly, Bothwell, and Lennox marched from Stirling with a force of ten thousand men, and compelled the governor to surrender to their charge, the infant Queen, with whom they returned to Stirling.

In the summer of 1544, Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, who had joined over to the party of King Henry VIII, plundered the Isle of Arran, and made himself master of the Isle of Bute and Rothesay Castle, with the support of eighteen ships and 800 men supplied by King Henry. As he sailed down the River Clyde, he was fired on by Archibald, who with four thousand men occupied Dunoon Castle. After a consultation with his English officers, Lennox attacked Dunoon Castle, as well as burning the nearby village and church. Sustaining great loss, Archibald was driven out of the castle. Lennox subsequently then laid waste a large part of Kintyre, but as he had not succeeded in regaining possession of his stronghold, Dumbarton Castle, Lennox retreated to his ships and sailed for England around 28 May 1544. Later, on the forfeiture of the estates of Lennox, Archibald was rewarded with the largest share. Although Lennox continued to arouse discontent in the Isles, the practical result of his actions only increased the power of the Earl of Argyll.

At the Battle of Pinkie, on 10 September 1547, the Earl of Argyll, with four thousand west Highlanders, held command of the right wing of the Scottish army. In January 1548, he advanced to Dundee to capture Broughty Castle; but English negotiators deterred him, even if he denied the rumours that he favored England and had been bought off. At the siege of Haddington, he was made &quot;Knight of the Cockle&quot; by King Henry II of France, at the same time as the Earls of Angus and Huntly.

Argyll wrote to Mary of Guise from Dunstaffnage Castle on 12 August 1554 after receiving her instructions to suppress rebellion in the Western Isles. He would proceed towards Mull and meet up with James McConnell and MacLaine, and Salabous, the Captain of Dunbar, had brought his soldiers.

Archibald Campbell had come under the influence of John Knox and the Scottish Reformation. On his way to Geneva in 1556, Knox stayed with him at Castle Campbell. After the agreement of the barons, in December 1557, that the reformed preachers should teach in private houses till the government should allow them to preach in public, Archibald took on the protection of John Douglas, a Carmelite friar. To induce Archibald to renounce the reformed faith, John Hamilton, Archbishop of St. Andrews, sent him a long letter, to which he wrote a detailed answer.

Archibald Campbell died between 21 August 1558 and 2 December 1558 in Dulnynn, Scotland. He was buried at Kilmun Parish Church in Cowal, Scotland. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son, also named Archibald Campbell.

==Family==
Archibald Campbell was married three times. He was married firstly to Lady Helen Hamilton (died in or before 1541), daughter of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran and Janet Bethune. They had a son:
*Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll
*Lady Janet Campbell, who married Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell, Lord of Tyrconnell.

Archibald was married secondly to Lady Margaret Graham, daughter of William Graham, 3rd Earl of Menteith and Margaret Moubray, on 21 April 1541 at the Priory of Inchmahome. They had three children:
*Colin Campbell, 6th Earl of Argyll
*Lady Margaret Campbell (died February 1572) who married James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune at Castle Campbell in January 1563.

*Lady Jeanette (or Janet) Campbell, who married Hector Og Maclean, 9th of Duart.
*Lady Agnes Campbell (born c. 1538)

Archibald was married thirdly to Catherine Maclean, daughter of Hector Mor Maclean, 8th of Duart and Mary MacDonald, on 12 March 1546. In 1561, she pledged a gold chain with Thomas Wallace, a tailor in Stirling, for a loan of 120 merks.

He had two other children who were illegitimate:
*Mary Campbell, who married Sir James Stewart of Ardmaleish, son of Ninian Stewart of Ardmaleish and Elizabeth Blair.
*Agnes Campbell (born illegitimately to Janet Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly).

<doc id="654678" wikidata="Q1318049" url="?curid=654678" title="WPP plc">
<text>WPP plc is a British multinational communications, advertising, public relations, technology, and commerce holding company headquartered in London, England. It is the world&#x27;s largest advertising company, as of 2023. WPP plc owns many companies, which include advertising, public relations, media, and market research networks such as AKQA, BCW, CMI Media Group, EssenceMediacom, Finsbury, Grey, Hill &amp; Knowlton, Mindshare, Ogilvy, Wavemaker, and VML. It is one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; agency companies, alongside Publicis, The Interpublic Group of Companies, and Omnicom Group. WPP has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

On 14 April 2018, Martin Sorrell retired 33 years after founding the company, following allegations of bullying and sexual indescretions, and Roberto Quarta was appointed chairman. Mark Read was appointed CEO in September 2018.

==History==
The company was founded as Wire and Plastic Products plc to manufacture wire shopping baskets in 1971. In 1985 Martin Sorrell and Preston Rabl, searching for a listed company through which to build a worldwide marketing services company, bought a controlling stake.

In 1986, WPP became the parent company of Picquotware, a manufacturer of teapots and jugs, based in Northampton. In November 1987 a fire destroyed the Northampton factory, so production was restarted at Burntwood in Staffordshire. On 25 November 2004 WPP closed the Burntwood factory, and stopped manufacturing Picquotware; all assets were sold on 14 December 2004.

In the 1980s, WPP began its strategy of growth via acquisitions. In later years, WPP regularly acquired dozens of companies annually. In January 1987, the company acquired Scott Stern Associates, at the time Scotland&#x27;s largest design and advertising company. In the same year (1987), the company acquired J. Walter Thompson (including JWT, Hill &amp; Knowlton, and MRB Group) for $566m. The company was listed on the NASDAQ in 1988 (and later switched its secondary listing to the NYSE). In 1989, it acquired Ogilvy Group for $864m.

WPP&#x27;s acquisitions continued into the 1990s, when WPP bought firms in the healthcare advertising, digital-marketing, online shopping, digital media, data management, retail and corporate consultancy, and sports-marketing industries. This included the 1999 acquisition of Lambie-Nairn. In 1998, WPP formed an alliance with Asatsu-DK Inc. of Japan.

In May 2000, WPP agreed to acquire the United States–based Young &amp; Rubicam Group for $5.7 billion, in what was at the time the largest ever takeover in the advertising sector. The takeover made WPP the largest advertising company in the world measured by billings and revenue, overtaking Omnicom Group and Interpublic.

In the 2000s, WPP Digital was created to develop the group&#x27;s digital capabilities. In October 2008, WPP acquired market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres for £1.6 billion. During 2009 WPP reduced its workforce by around 14,000 employees, or 12.3% of its then total staff numbers, in response to the onset of the 2008–2012 global recession.

In June 2012, WPP agreed to acquire the digital advertising agency AKQA for US$540 million. In November 2015, WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in Essence, a global digital agency.

In November 2016, WPP announced it will be acquiring PEP, LLC, a project management and procurement company that oversees shopper marketing promotions for clients, in the US.

Many of WPP&#x27;s constituent agencies use Microsoft Windows, and the organisation was among those hit by the 2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine, with some staff&#x27;s computer access limited to webmail only as much as ten days later.

WPP merged Burson-Marsteller with Cohn &amp; Wolfe to become BCW (Burson Cohn &amp; Wolfe) in February 2018.

In April 2018, Martin Sorrell retired after 33 years, following allegations of personal misconduct and misuse of company assets. Sorrell has denied the allegations. Chairman Roberto Quarta was temporarily named executive chairman. In September 2018, Mark Read, who was the global CEO of Wunderman, was named CEO.

In the late 2010s, the advertising industry faced significant challenges. Changes in the industry landscape included financial pressure on global clients, in particular fast-moving consumer goods clients, companies taking work in-house, the ability to directly advertise on tech platforms, and competition with consultancies. While WPP had previously outperformed other companies in the industry, its growth slowed starting in 2017 and its market value dropped in 2018. Critics said WPP needed to become &quot;nimbler&quot; and &quot;leaner&quot;. At the time, many WPP agencies operated mostly independently and competed for accounts. In late 2018, Read said the company had grown &quot;unwieldy with too much duplication&quot;. He instituted a plan to reposition WPP as a &quot;creative transformation company&quot; and make its offer simpler. Read emphasized the importance of technology and also merged several WPP agencies: J. Walter Thompson merged with Wunderman to create Wunderman Thompson and Y&amp;R merged with VML to create VMLY&amp;R. Within Read&#x27;s first year as CEO, he trimmed WPP by selling more than 30 subsidiaries, including a majority stake in Kantar. By selling a majority stake of Kantar to Bain Capital, WPP is believed to have generated $3.1 billion to help pay down debt. Read also sold the original Wire and Plastic Products company that Sorrell had purchased to create his business empire.

The sale of 60% of the shares in Kantar was completed in December 2019. $1.9bn was used to reduce WPP&#x27;s debt, and $1.2bn was returned to shareholders.

In July 2022, WPP acquired Corebiz, a Latin American ecommerce agency, for an undisclosed amount.

In July 2024, WPP announced the appointment of former BT Group chief Philip Jansen as its chairman succeeding Roberto Quarta. Jansen is set to take over from Quarta as chairman on 1 January 2025.

==Operations==
WPP is a large holding company involved in communications, advertising, public relations, and other businesses. It is considered the world&#x27;s biggest advertising agency group. WPP focuses on communications, experience, commerce, and technology. Headquartered in London, England, WPP has approximately 130,000 employees throughout its portfolio of businesses across more than 100 countries, as of 2018.

WPP&#x27;s notable advertising agency company holdings include Grey, Ogilvy, VMLY&amp;R, and Wunderman Thompson. The XM Gravity Indonesia subsidiary company was founded in 2008.

WPP&#x27;s digital company holdings include AKQA. WPP&#x27;s public relations and public affairs company holdings include Hill+Knowlton Strategies, BCW (Burson Cohn &amp; Wolfe), and Ogilvy. WPP&#x27;s media investment management company holdings include GroupM, Mindshare, Wavemaker and Essence. WPP&#x27;s research insight and consulting companies include Kantar. Hogarth Worldwide is a WPP-owned production company.

WPP&#x27;s shopper marketing promotions company is PEP, LLC (formerly Promotion Execution Partners). WPP-owned brand consultancies include Superunion (a combination of Brand Union, Lambie-Nairn, and three other brand consulting businesses) and Landor.

==Controversies==
===Cillit Bang viral marketing controversy===
In 2005 advertising agency Cohn &amp; Wolfe (later merged into WPP) was contracted by Reckitt to operate a blog as the fictional character Barry Scott, advertising mascot for Reckitt&#x27;s cleaning fluid Cillit Bang, as a viral marketing platform. In October of that year blogger Tom Coates wrote an emotional post to his own blog about his long-estranged father. Among the expressions of condolences and sympathy in the post&#x27;s comment section was one from a user identifying themselves as Barry Scott, with a link back to Cohn &amp; Wolfe&#x27;s in-character blog as Barry Scott. Offended by the apparent use of his blog comments on such a personal post as a spam advertising venue, Coates traced the comment&#x27;s originating IP address through addresses owned by Young &amp; Rubicam and back to Reckitt. Reckitt initially denied responsibility for the message, but wrote Coates an apology acknowledging the message&#x27;s inappropriateness, and Cohn &amp; Wolfe issued a statement of remorse for their misuse of the &quot;experimental&quot; blog which they then ceased operating.

The controversy and its fallout led to further discussions among the blogger community as well as the advertising industry on the ethical issues surrounding blogs being &quot;operated&quot; by fictional characters for the purposes of advertising without being clearly labeled as such, and the extent to which those blogs should be allowed to participate in the greater blogosphere.

===2012 shareholder revolt on executive remuneration===
With a number of shareholder revolts over executive pay having already happened at other public companies&#x27; AGMs earlier in the year, the media coverage of Martin Sorrell&#x27;s intended £12.93m compensation package drew increasing public attention in 2012. The result was a 59.52% shareholder vote to reject the resolution.

===Taxation===
It has been reported that WPP goes to great lengths to lower its own corporate tax bill. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that between 2003 and 2009 the company paid £27m in UK corporation tax, compared to what the newspaper &quot;might expect&quot; based on reports of the firm making 15% of its profit in the UK, of around £126m.

===Television audience measurement===

In 2012, the Indian broadcasting NDTV filed a lawsuit against Television Audience Measurement (TAM), a joint venture of the former competitors Nielsen and Kantar Media Research which for years has provided the only TV audience measurement system in India. The lawsuit alleged that viewership data were manipulated in favor of broadcasters willing to provide bribes. WPP Plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of Kantar and IMRB.

The lawsuit was dismissed in its entirety on 4 March 2013.

=== Work for fossil fuel companies ===
WPP handles the accounts of many major oil companies. Asked by Reuters to disclose their client list, WPP refused to do so. WPP has defended its work for fossil fuel companies. Lawsuits have alleged that four of WPP&#x27;s advertisement campaigns for fossil fuel companies have been misleading or entailed greenwashing.

===Violating the law in Vietnam===
WPP has been fined on three occasions by the Ministry of Information and Communications for advertising products on YouTube and Facebook in a manner which breached Vietnam&#x27;s strict laws on cross-border advertising. The legislation is designed to combat offensive material which is intended to damage the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Government of Vietnam. WPP had committed various advertising violations, including inserting advertisements into intervals in the Chinese drama series &quot;Flight to You&quot; which depicted the disputed U-shaped line.

<text>The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps by Marshall T. Savage is a book (published in 1992 and reprinted in 1994 with an introduction by Arthur C. Clarke) in the field of exploratory engineering that gives a series of concrete stages the author believes will lead to interstellar colonization. Many specific scientific and engineering details are presented, as are numerous issues involved in space colonization.

==The book&#x27;s thesis==
Savage takes a Malthusian view of the exponential growth of human population and life in general, and also recommends the exponential growth of blue-green algae for sustenance. He states that it is humanity&#x27;s destiny to colonize every star in the galaxy. He draws heavily on the Fermi paradox (briefly stated as, &quot;If there is intelligent life in space, why haven&#x27;t we found it yet?&quot;) to support his position that it is humanity&#x27;s burden alone to ignite the universe with the &quot;spark of Life.&quot;
In &quot;The Millennial Project&quot;, he calls for the creation of an international foundation to realize these goals. Originally known as the &quot;First Millennial Foundation&quot; (founded by Savage in 1987), the organization changed its name to the Living Universe Foundation.

==The steps of the project==
The &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot; proposed by Savage are as follows:
# Foundationconstitute an organization convened to realize these destinies.
# Aquariusbuild arcologies in the tropical oceans as a first step to learning how to build (&quot;grow&quot;) colonies in space using a method not unlike that used by living corals developed by Prof. Wolf Hartmut Hilbertz and applying his concept of Cybertecture. They also would generate income to fund later steps.
# Bifrostfirst step in actually getting off the Earth using ground-based free-electron-laser-powered laser-propelled Waverider. Leik Myrabo, an aerospace engineering professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, demonstrated the feasibility of using ground-based lasers to propel objects into orbit in 1988.
# Asgardbuild a space station in geosynchronous orbit.
# Avalonbuild colonies on the Moon by doming over the craters and creating miniature ecologies.
# Elysiumstart terraforming Mars to &quot;create a living planet to sustain us&quot; connected with Earth through Buzz Aldrin&#x27;s proposed Mars Transit System, an example of Earth-Mars cycler.
# Solariamine asteroids to create asteroid colonies and Asgard-like stations throughout the Solar System to create a Dyson cloud.
# Galactiacolonize beyond the Solar System, expand throughout the galaxy heading to a level 3 on the Kardashev scale, a method of measuring a civilization&#x27;s level of energy production and consumption.
In the early stages of the Project, Savage recommends Spirulina algae as a primary foodstuff, supplemented by seafood mariculture from the cities of the Aquarius phase.

The Living Universe Foundation, previously known as the First Millennial Foundation, is an organization that supports ocean and space colonization more or less based upon the book &quot;The Millennial Project&quot;. Space Environments Ecovillage in Bastrop, Texas, is one of the few LUF projects that have materialized so far.

==Criticisms==
The book has drawn some criticism in that while it is replete with details concerning OTEC construction and space colonization, it touches very little on the subject of how governments and societies will need to change to enact the Project. Defenders and the author himself maintain that one man writing one book cannot be expected to write out the entire course of human development over the next millennium, and that others more suited to the field of social psychology will be needed for the Project&#x27;s completion.

<text>Colin Campbell, 6th [[Duke of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]] (c. 1542– October 1584) was a Scottish nobleman and politician. He was appointed to the Lord Chancellorship of Scotland.

==Biography==
He was the eldest son of Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll and his second wife Margaret Graham. He was a younger half-brother of Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll. His maternal grandparents were William Graham, 3rd Earl of Menteith and Margaret Moubray.

Argyll made a progress in Lorne, Argyll, and Cowal in July 1574 holding courts and executing those convicted of &quot;slaughter, murder, theft, or common sorcery.&quot; Around 160 people were executed by hanging. Some &quot;women and men suspected of witchcraft and sorcery were apprehended&quot; and kept in prison or released on caution, until further trial. Argyll also ensured churches had ministers or readers teaching the Bible in Scottish Gaelic as translated by the late John Carswell, Bishop of the Isles. He sought the resolution of feuds between Aonghus MacDonald of Kintyre and Lachlan Mor Maclean, and MacConnell Gorm, Lord of the Isles, and the Laird of Glengarry.

In May 1583, James VI granted Colin Argyll and his wife Annas or Agnes Keith the lands of Lundie, Forfarshire.

==Marriages and family==
Colin was first married to Joan Stewart, daughter of Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven and his second wife Janet Stewart. (Her maternal grandparents were John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl and Lady Janet Campbell. Janet was a daughter of Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll and Elizabeth Stewart. Elizabeth was a daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox and Margaret Montgomerie. Margaret was a daughter of Alexander Montgomerie, 1st Lord Montgomerie and Margaret Boyd.)

In January 1572, he married secondly Agnes or Annas Keith, Countess of Moray. She was a daughter of William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal and his wife Margaret Keith. Their first child was a stillborn son. They had three children:

*Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll (c. 1575–1638).
*Colin Campbell of Lundie (died c. 1650).
* Jane Campbell

He died in 1584 and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

He had written his will at Darnaway Castle in September 1584. His goods included 18 pieces of tapestry at Castle Campbell and three horns set in silver.

<text>Santos Benavides (November 1, 1823 – November 9, 1891) was a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War. Benavides was the highest-ranking Tejano soldier in the Confederate military.

==Biography==
Benavides was born in Laredo, a descendant of Tomás Sánchez de la Barrera y Garza, the founder of Laredo, as well as the descendant of Captain Francisco Baez De Benavides, born in the Canary Islands and a Spanish early colonist of Northern Mexico. Benavides was elected Mayor of Laredo in 1856 and then became Webb County Judge in 1859. He was a Captain of the 33rd Texas Cavalry, also called Benavides&#x27;s Regiment, until he was promoted to Colonel in November 1863.

Colonel Santos Benavides became the highest ranking Tejano officer in the Confederate Army. There are instances of him acting as a slave catcher, venturing into Mexico and retrieving runaway slaves and returning them to their masters, for which he was compensated.

On May 22, 1861, at the Battle of Carrizo (also called Battle of Zapata), Benavides engaged the local Tejano leader Juan Cortina (who had invaded Zapata County, an event usually referred as the &quot;Second Cortina War&quot;), and drove him back into Mexico. Probably his greatest contribution to the Confederacy was securing passage of Confederate cotton to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, in 1863. Due to the Union blockade of ports along the Gulf of Mexico, shipping cotton to Mexico was one of the few ways the Confederacy was able to earn needed cash. On March 18, 1864, Major Alfred Holt led a force of about two hundred men of the Union First Texas Cavalry who were stationed near Brownsville, Texas under the command of Colonel Edmund J. Davis, who had earlier offered Benavides a Union generalship. Their mission was to destroy five thousand bales of cotton stacked at the San Agustín Plaza in Laredo. Colonel Benavides commanded 42 men and repelled three Union attacks at the Zacate Creek in what is known as the Battle of Laredo. Colonel Benavides secured passage of the 5,000 cotton bales into Mexico. In May 1865, Benavides&#x27;s regiment participated in the last land battle of the Civil War, the Battle of Palmito Ranch.

After the war ended, he resumed his merchant and ranching activities and remained active in politics. He served three terms in the Texas State Legislature from 1879 to 1885. He died in Laredo and is buried there.

<doc id="654686" wikidata="Q1477359" url="?curid=654686" title="Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing">
<text>The Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing, also called the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge and Second Narrows Bridge, is the second bridge constructed at the Second (east) Narrows of Burrard Inlet in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Originally named the Second Narrows Bridge, it connects Vancouver to the North Shore of Burrard Inlet, which includes the District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver. It was constructed adjacent to the older Second Narrows Bridge, which is now exclusively a rail bridge. Its construction, from 1956 to 1960, was marred by a multi-death collapse on June 17, 1958. The First Narrows Bridge, better known as Lions Gate Bridge, crosses Burrard Inlet about west of the Second Narrows.

The bridge is a steel truss cantilever bridge, designed by Swan Wooster Engineering Co. Ltd. Construction began in November 1957, and the bridge was officially opened on August 25, 1960. It cost approximately $23 million to build. Tolls were charged until April 1, 1963.

The bridge is long with a centre span of . It is part of the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1).

==Collapse==
On June 17, 1958, as a crane stretched from the north side of the new bridge to join the two chords of the unfinished arch, several spans collapsed. Seventy-nine workers plunged into the water. Eighteen were killed either instantly or shortly thereafter, possibly drowned by their heavy tool belts. A diver searching for bodies drowned later, bringing the total fatalities for the collapse to nineteen. In a subsequent Royal Commission inquiry, the bridge collapse was attributed to miscalculation by bridge engineers. A temporary support, holding the fifth anchor span, was deemed insufficient to bear the weight.

In December 1957, a safety inspector from the British Columbia Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Board had reported that the installation of a safety net under the work platforms was &quot;impracticable&quot; following the death of another steelworker.

==Renaming==
The bridge was renamed the &quot;Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing&quot; on June 17, 1994, to honour the eighteen workers who died in the collapse, along with one rescue diver and four other workers who also died during the construction process.

==In popular culture==

* Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors paid a musical tribute to the fallen ironworkers with the song &quot;The Bridge Came Tumbling Down&quot; on his 1972 album &quot;My Stompin&#x27; Grounds&quot;. (This song also appears on several later compilations, one of which was performed by Les Claypool&#x27;s Duo de Twang).
* Jimmy Dean&#x27;s 1962 song &quot;Steel Men&quot; is a ballad about the Second Narrows bridge disaster.
* Gary Geddes&#x27; 2007 book of poetry, entitled &quot;Falsework,&quot; is based on the collapse of the bridge.

==Notes==
* On February 2, 2009, several University of British Columbia engineering students were arrested while attempting to suspend the shell of a Volkswagen Beetle under the bridge as part of an &quot;Engineering Week&quot; tradition.

<text>Adams Morgan (sometimes locally called AdMo) is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., located in the city’s Northwest quadrant. Adams Morgan is noted as a historic hub for counterculture and as an arts district. It is also known for its popular entertainment district and culinary scene, centered on both 18th Street and Columbia Road.

In the 21st century, Adams Morgan has been a focus of urban redevelopment and become one of Washington&#x27;s most gentrifying neighborhoods. Notable local businesses include the famed live music club Madam&#x27;s Organ Blues Bar and the Michelin-starred restaurant Tail Up Goat, among others. Adams Morgan has also become one of the hubs of LGBTQ culture in Washington, D.C.

==History==

When the District of Columbia was created in 1791, Robert Peter and Anthony Holmead, two prominent colonial-era landowners, held the land comprising Adams Morgan. At that time, these local tracts were north of the original planned City of Washington, and were either undeveloped or only lightly farmed. As the population of D.C. expanded, this land was divided into several estates purchased by wealthy residents, including Meridian Hill, Cliffbourne, Holt House, Oak Lawn, Henderson Castle, a part of Kalorama, and the horse farm of William Thornton.

After the American Civil War, these estates were subdivided and the area slowly grew. Once the city&#x27;s overall-layout plans were finalized in the 1890s, these various subdivisions, using modern construction techniques, developed more rapidly, and the area of Adams Morgan then grew into several attractive and largely upper- and middle-class neighborhoods.

In the early 20th century, the area was home to a range of people, from the very wealthy living along 16th Street, to white-collar professionals in Lanier Heights, to blue-collar residents east of 18th Street NW.

After World War II and &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, racial desegregation began. When D.C. was formally desegregated, some white people abruptly left the area, others stayed and worked to integrate the neighborhood, and some African American and Hispanic people moved into the area. With cheaper housing, the area also became home to some artists and social activists.

In 1948, Charles Lazarus founded Toys &quot;R&quot; Us in Adams Morgan.

In the early 1950s, before desegregation, the neighborhood was considered &quot;ritzy.&quot; Pursuant to the 1954 &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot; Supreme Court ruling, district schools were desegregated in 1955. The Adams-Morgan Community Council, comprising both Adams and Morgan schools and the neighborhoods they served, formed in 1958 to implement progressively this desegregation. The boundaries of the neighborhood were drawn through four existing neighborhoods—Washington Heights, Lanier Heights, Kalorama Triangle, and Meridian Hill—naming the resulting area after both schools.

In 1955, Herbert Haft founded Dart Drug in Adams Morgan.

In the late 1960s, a group of residents worked with city officials to plan and construct the Marie H. Reed Recreation Center, an elementary school and recreational complex, named after the minister and civic leader. In 1967, the Ambassador Theater opened; it closed in 1969.

After the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots, white flight continued.

In the 1980s, Hazel Williams operated Hazel&#x27;s, which featured live blues and jazz, and its soul food offerings made it a favorite of Dizzy Gillespie and Muhammad Ali when they were in Washington, D.C.

The January 20, 2005 counter-inaugural protest included a march through Adams Morgan.

From 2010 to 2012, the city reconstructed 18th Street NW, one of the neighborhood&#x27;s main commercial corridors, with wider sidewalks, more crosswalks and bicycle arrows, resulting in a more pedestrian-friendly thoroughfare. In September 2014, the American Planning Association named Adams Morgan one of the nation&#x27;s &quot;great neighborhoods,&quot; citing its intact Victorian rowhouses, murals, international diversity, and pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly streetscape. In 2021, many local businesses attempted to disband the local business improvement district. However, they were unsuccessful.
==Geography==

The name Adams Morgan, once hyphenated, is derived from the names of two formerly segregated area elementary schools—the older, all-black Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School (now defunct) and the all-white John Quincy Adams Elementary School, which merged in 1955 following racial desegregation.

Adams Morgan is bounded: 
*to the south by Florida Avenue NW and the Dupont Circle neighborhood
*to the southwest by the Duke Ellington Bridge and by Connecticut Avenue NW and Kalorama-Sheridan
*to the north by Harvard St. and Mount Pleasant
* to the east by 16th Street NW and Columbia Heights

Reed-Cooke is often considered to be a sub-neighborhood of Adams Morgan, consisting of the easternmost area between Columbia Road and Florida avenue, but it can also be considered to be part of the Meridian Hill neighborhood.

==Demographics==
Along with neighboring Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights, Adams Morgan long has been a gateway community for immigrants. Since the 1960s, the predominant international presence in both communities has been Latino, with the majority of immigrants coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and other Central American countries. It also has attracted immigrants from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.

Since 1980, the population of the neighborhood increased marginally from 15,352 to 15,630, while average real annual household income more than doubled from $72,753 to $172,249 and the white non-Hispanic population increased from 51% to 68%.

==Econom==

Adams Morgan is one of the most popular entertainment districts in Washington, known for its restaurants and bars. Approximately 100 establishments possess liquor licenses. A moratorium on new liquor licenses has been in effect since 2000. 

The Adams Morgan Partnership Business Improvement District (AMPBID) has been active in the community since 2005; its stated mission is to promote a clean, friendly and safe Adams Morgan. It sponsors local events such as summer concerts and holiday decorations, and provides information to residents.

==Landmarks==

The Adams Morgan farmers&#x27; market operates, weather permitting, every Saturday from June to December.

The area is home to a number of diplomatic missions, including the Embassy of the Central African Republic and the Embassy of Gabon.

Local historic landmarks include the Fuller House and Euclid Apartments.

Examples of public artwork in Adams Morgan include &quot;Carry the Rainbow on Your Shoulders&quot;, &quot;The Servant Christ&quot;, and &quot;The Mama Ayesha&#x27;s Restaurant Presidential Mural&quot;.

===Adams Morgan Day===
Adams Morgan Day is a multicultural street celebration with live music and food and crafts booths.

==Transportation==

Adams Morgan is not directly served by the Washington Metro system. The station nearest to Adams Morgan, Woodley Park station, is in the Woodley Park neighborhood, but was renamed &quot;Woodley Park–Zoo/Adams Morgan&quot; in 1999 to reflect the station&#x27;s proximity to Adams Morgan. The station was renamed &quot;Woodley Park&quot; with &quot;Zoo/Adams Morgan&quot; as a subtitle in 2011. 

The southernmost parts of the neighborhood near Rock Creek Park are closer to the Dupont Circle station, while the northeastern parts of the neighborhood are closer to the Columbia Heights Station. 

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates a DC Circulator bus route connecting the center of Adams Morgan with both Metro stations. The area is also served by several WMATA Metrobus lines, including the 42, 43, 90, 92, 96, H1, L2, S2, and S9.

==Education==

The District of Columbia Public Schools is the public school system. Part of the neighborhood is assigned to Oyster-Adams K-8, part is assigned to Marie Reed Elementary and Columbia Heights Education Campus, and part is assigned to H.D. Cooke Elementary and Columbia Heights Education Campus. The entire neighborhood is assigned to Jackson-Reed High School.

Oyster-Adams Bilingual School, the neighborhood K-8 school, was formed in 2007 by the merger of John Quincy Adams Elementary School in Adams Morgan and James F. Oyster Bilingual Elementary School in Woodley Park. The Adams campus serves grades 4-8 and the Oyster campus serves grades Pre-Kindergarten through 3.

The Marie Reed Elementary School, with its Learning Center, built in 1977, was extensively remodeled and reopened in 2017.

H.D. Cooke Elementary School is at 2525 17th Street; it was renovated in 2009 as an environmentally friendly green building.

==Local politics==
Adams Morgan is a part of Ward 1, and is in the service area of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 1C, the Adams Morgan Advisory Neighborhood Commission. The ANC covers the area between Harvard Street and Rock Creek to the north, Florida Avenue and U Street to the south, 16th Street NW to the east, and Connecticut Avenue to the west.

==In popular culture==

Adams Morgan is where jumbo slice pizza was popularized. Jumbo slice is an oversized New York-style pizza. It is particularly popular as a late-night meal. 

The neighborhood is also where the D.C. hardcore punk rock scene became popular, eventually spreading to other parts of the country and the world. 

The Madam&#x27;s Organ Bar was described as a popular hangout by Playboy and Stuff, and was featured on the Wild On! travel series on E!.

===Film and television===

The neighborhood&#x27;s competing &quot;jumbo slice&quot; pizza establishments were covered in an episode of the Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Food Wars&quot;.

In the Showtime Network series &quot;Homeland&quot; Season 3, Episode 4 (&quot;Game On&quot;), the main character Carrie Mathison states that she lives in Adams Morgan.

Scenes from the 2010 movie &quot;How Do You Know&quot; featuring Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon were filmed in Adams Morgan.

In the Netflix series &quot;Taken&quot;, the neighborhood is mentioned in Season 1, Episode 8, as the location where a car bomb explodes.

<doc id="654690" wikidata="Q4384149" url="?curid=654690" title="USS Chauncey (DD-3)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Chauncey&quot; was a , also referred to as a &quot;Torpedo-boat destroyer&quot;, in the United States Navy named for Commodore Isaac Chauncey. She was launched in 1901 and sunk in 1917.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Chauncey&quot; was laid down at Neafie and Levy Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 2 December 1899 as a member of the &quot;Bainbridge&quot; class, and was launched on 26 October 1901.

&quot;Chauncey&quot; was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . As the &quot;Bainbridge&quot; class was intended to be more seaworthy than the US Navy&#x27;s torpedo boats, the ship had a raised forecastle instead of the &quot;turtleback&quot; forecastle common in European designs. Design displacement was and full load, although all ships of the class were overweight. Four Thornycroft boilers fed steam at to triple expansion steam engines rated at driving two shafts for a design speed of . Four funnels were fitted. Armament consisted of two /50 caliber guns, five 6-pounder () guns and two torpedo tubes.

&quot;Chauncey&quot; was placed in reduced commission on 20 November 1902, then placed in reserve on 2 December 1902 and received full commission on 21 February 1903. Lieutenant Stanford Elwood Moses was placed in command and &quot;Chauncey&quot; reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

==Pre-World War I==
&quot;Chauncey&quot; served with the Coast Squadron until 20 September 1903, when she was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet and left Key West for the Orient on 18 December. After sailing by way of the Suez Canal, she arrived at Cavite to join the force representing US interest in the Far East as it cruised in the Philippines during winters and off China during summers. Aside from the period of 3 December 1905 – 12 January 1907, when she was in reserve at Cavite, &quot;Chauncey&quot; continued this service until the entrance of America into World War I.

===Sinking===
The destroyer sailed from Cavite on 1 August 1917 for convoy escort duty in the eastern Atlantic, based at St. Nazaire, France. On 19 November, while about west of Gibraltar on escort duty, &quot;Chauncey&quot; was rammed by the British merchantman SS &quot;Rose&quot; as both ships steamed in war-imposed darkness. At 03:17, &quot;Chauncey&quot; sank in of water, taking to their death 21 men including her captain, Lieutenant Commander Walter E. Reno, the namesake of the , and LTJG Charles F. Wedderburn, the namesake of the . Seventy survivors were picked up by &quot;Rose&quot;, and carried to port.

==&quot;Chauncey&quot; in literature==
The novel &quot;Delilah&quot; was written by a survivor of &quot;Chauncey&quot;, Marcus Goodrich, and is a fictional account based on his experience serving aboard &quot;Chauncey&quot; as an enlisted man.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Ensign Joseph Rollie Defrees (26 September 1905 – 3 December 1905) (Later Rear Admiral)
* Lieutenant Frank Jack Fletcher (18 April 1912 – 21 December 1912) (Later Admiral) - &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyer named for his uncle, Medal of Honor recipient Admiral Frank F. Fletcher.

<text>The Second Narrows Rail Bridge is a vertical-lift railway bridge that crosses the Burrard Inlet and connects Vancouver with the North Shore. The bridge&#x27;s south end connects directly to the Thornton Tunnel, which connects it to the main Canadian rail network. As the name suggests, it is located at the second narrowing of the Burrard Inlet.

The bridge has a maximum speed limit of .

==History==

===Background===

During the Klondike Gold Rush, there were schemes to build a railway from Vancouver to the Dawson gold fields. The first stage in this would be to bridge Burrard Inlet and then build a railway north. John Hendry floated the Vancouver, Westminster, and Yukon Railway which built a line from Ladner to New Westminster and then to Vancouver via Burnaby Lake. This line was paired with the Great Northern Railway who also wanted trackage into Vancouver.

In the process, various other railroads all became involved in the bridging scheme: the Canadian Northern Railway, Milwaukee Road, and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. The bridge itself would be owned by the Federal Government as they had control of harbours and shipping, and would lease access to the railways as they did with the rail bridge in New Westminster. One of the main reasons was that there was very little space on the south shore for wharves, thus railways wanted to develop the North Shore as the south side was occupied by another railway, the Canadian Pacific. A company was floated, the Burrard Inlet Bridge and Tunnel Company, and contracts were issued to span the tidal bore. At one point, a causeway was planned to dam the narrows and create bridges and wharves that way.

World War I intervened, as did the bankruptcy of all the interested railways. With it went dreams of the bridge and rails up Indian Arm, the Capilano valley, or via Howe Sound. However, the predecessor railways did sign contracts to build
a bridge and a new Hotel Vancouver. Only after the war with huge increase in funding to improve harbours around the British Empire, partly due to problems associated with wartime shipping, did funds appear for the completion of the 1925 bridge. And so the north shore port became an amalgam of operations with Canadian National, Pacific Great Eastern and Harbour and Wharves Commission all using the bridge when it was not out of service. North Vancouver ferries operated at this time as well.

The essential wartime shipyards in North Vancouver underscored the need for reliable industrial access. Further, the expansion of Lynnterm, Wheat elevators, coal and the sulphur port in the 1960s indicated the growing use of the North Shore.

===Original bridge (1925)===

Northern Construction Co &amp; J.W. Stewart Ltd built the first bridge to connect Vancouver with the North Shore over the tidal bore of the narrows. The attached vehicle deck opened to road traffic in 1925 and the main structure to trains a year later. After being hit by a number of ships and being out of service for four years, the provincial government bought the bridge in 1933 and installed a lift section of the deck.

In 1960, a new much larger and higher 6-lane Second Narrows Bridge with a span was completed alongside the original bridge, and the original bridge was converted exclusively for rail use. In 1994, the new road bridge was renamed the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing in honour of the ironworkers who died in accidents while building it. However, the new bridge is still commonly referred to as the Second Narrows Bridge.
===Second bridge (1969)===

In 1969, the original 1926 railbridge was replaced by CN Rail with a larger, higher lift bridge. A bridgetender activates cables and counterweights to raise the span. Unless moving a train across Burrard Inlet, the lift section is always in the up position to allow ships to go underneath.

The current bridge has a vertical clearance of at the main lift span fully raised (open position). The vertical lift section of the Second Narrows Railway Bridge provides clear navigation width between rubbing fenders. However, the Ironworkers Second Narrows road bridge has a vertical clearance of and the shipping channel where the maximum horizontal clearance available is wide.

== Chronology of the bridges ==


* 1902: The V. W. and Y Railway is completed to Burnaby. A bridge is planned.
* 1910: Bridge plans by the Burrard Inlet Bridge and Tunnel Company are proposed.
* 1912: Land speculation happens on the North Shore, subject to completion of a bridge.
* 1914: A railway to Deep Cove and Port Moody is planned.
* 1915: Stock market collapses; P. G. E. Railway goes bankrupt.
* 1916: A causeway is planned; Canadian Northern goes bankrupt.
* 1925: A smaller, lower bridge than originally envisioned is completed.
* 1926: Trains begin using the bridge.
* 1927: The freighter , carrying large cargo of lumber, hits the bridge on March 10, causing almost $8,000 worth of damage.
* 1928: Hit by freighter .
* 1930: The freighter &quot;Losmar&quot; hits the south span.
* 1930: On September 19, the barge &quot;Pacific Gatherer&quot; becomes wedged under the bridge&#x27;s . The tide rises, pushing the barge up under the span, knocking it off its supports. The span hangs off one side before suddenly breaking free and sinking into the depths of Burrard Inlet. Lawsuits and the bankruptcy of the Bridge company delay any attempt at repairs. The bridge remains closed for four years.
* 1933: The bridge is sold to the provincial government and repairs begin.
* 1934: The bridge reopens, with the bascule replaced by a centre lift span.
* 1952: North Vancouver voters approve leasing the non-road portion of the bridge to CNR, based on promises to lure out-of-province industrial companies to the North Shore.
* 1963: The bridge is closed to highway traffic.
* 1964: The bridge is sold to the CNR for $1.
* 1965: CNR unveils plans to build a replacement rail bridge and a tunnel to bypass the existing, meandering route from the south through central Vancouver and the South Shore.
* 1969: A new, larger lift bridge is built immediately to the east of the 1926 bridge.
* 1969: The Thornton Tunnel is dug for CN trains to connect with the rail line at Willingdon.
* 1970: The old 1926 bridge is removed, as are its cement piers.
* 1979: In October, the Japanese freighter &quot;Japan Erica&quot;, carrying logs, collides with the bridge in a heavy fog, knocking a section of the bridge just north of the lift span into the water. The bridge was closed until March 4, 1980. The cost of fixing the bridge was CAD$6.5 million.
