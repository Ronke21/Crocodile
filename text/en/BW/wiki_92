<text>Desolation Island is the fifth historical novel in the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. It was first published in 1978.

The story follows Jack Aubrey as he takes command of HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; on a mission meant to reach Australia, and occurs prior to the War of 1812. Stephen Maturin is assigned to the voyage in order to monitor a beautiful young American spy who is aboard the ship as a prisoner.

Critics praised the novel&#x27;s “literate, clear-eyed realism” at initial publication, as well as the stirring naval action in the cold southern ocean as the &quot;Leopard&quot; is chased by the Dutch ship.

==Plot summary==
Having recovered financially in &quot;The Mauritius Command&quot;, Captain Jack Aubrey is expanding his home and has paid off his mother-in-law&#x27;s debts, and his wife is no longer pinching pennies. His household is staffed with seamen, and his twin daughters and infant son are thriving. Despite his comfortable pay while serving in the Fencibles office, he is still frittering away his fortune with foolish business endeavours, and Stephen Maturin suggests that Jack&#x27;s tendency to assume honesty in others is getting him cheated at cards. Stephen learns that Diana Villiers has returned from America, unmarried, but when he calls upon her he only finds a letter explaining that her young American friend Louisa Wogan has been apprehended by British authorities and questioned as a spy. Though Diana herself is innocent of the espionage charges, she has been forced to flee England suddenly, so Stephen pays her bills. Arrangements are made to transport Mrs Wogan to a penal colony in New South Wales.

Meanwhile, the governor in New South Wales, Captain Bligh of &quot;Bounty&quot; infamy, has been deposed in a feud with the local settlers. Jack is offered command of the old HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; for a mission to Australia to restore Bligh, which he accepts to escape his woes on land. Sir Joseph Blaine explains to Stephen that Mrs Wogan will be carried aboard the &quot;Leopard&quot; as a prisoner, along with two dozen other convicts to disguise the nature of the charges against her. Jack is furious at having to carry prisoners. Partly to prevent Stephen&#x27;s laudanum addiction from compromising his work, Blaine assigns Maturin to the voyage to watch Wogan, hoping that by doing so he may uncover American secrets.

Shortly after embarking, the prisoners kill their superintendent and surgeon during a storm, and Stephen discovers the squalor of their captivity in the orlop. Jack orders their conditions be improved to meet naval standards but an outbreak of gaol fever nonetheless spreads from the convicts to the seamen, killing most of the male prisoners and 116 of the ship&#x27;s crew and leaving the &quot;Leopard&quot; severely undermanned. Stephen&#x27;s assistant Mr Martin dies, and is replaced by Michael Herapath, who has stowed away in pursuit of his lover, Mrs Wogan. Jack rates Herapath a midshipman despite his American citizenship. The ship is forced to leave many recovering crew members at Recife, including Tom Pullings. He is replaced with James Grant as first lieutenant, who proves a challenge for Captain Aubrey. While they are in port, HMS &quot;Nymph&quot; arrives damaged from an encounter with the &quot;Waakzaamheid&quot;, a Dutch 74-gun ship-of-the-line, while crossing the Equator. Stephen fabricates a story that Mr Martin was a French agent in a letter that he deliberately leaves for Herapath and Wogan to read and copy, hoping the false information will confuse French and American intelligence.

The &quot;Leopard&quot; encounters the Dutch ship before reaching the Cape of Good Hope, but Jack cannot risk a confrontation with the much larger and fully manned &quot;Waakzaamheid&quot;. He repels a boarding party with grapeshot during the night and nearly escapes his pursuer, but the Dutch captain eerily predicts Jack&#x27;s every move and blocks his route to the Cape. The Dutchman chases them south into the Roaring Forties for five days, where the waves and wind increase, and the ships finally engage in dangerously high seas. Casks of fresh water are jettisoned from the &quot;Leopard&quot; to lighten her. After a long exchange of fire Jack is struck in the head by a large splinter and knocked senseless. With the &quot;Waakzaamheid&quot; gaining on her, a lucky shot from the &quot;Leopard&quot; strikes her foremast, causing it to fall into the sea. Without its driving force the &quot;Waakzaamheid&quot; yaws onto her beam-ends in the trough of a deep wave and is overwhelmed by the next, sinking with all hands.

Now east of the Cape, the &quot;Leopard&quot; aims for New South Wales. Jack orders the crew to collect ice from icebergs to replace their fresh water stores, but the ship strikes an iceberg stern-on, damaging the rudder and causing a severe leak. Desperate to save the ship, all hands work the pumps continuously for days and rush to fother a sail to stop the leak. Though Jack has been seriously wounded in the battle, he tries to quell rumors that his mind is unsound. Believing the &quot;Leopard&quot; cannot be saved, Grant challenges Jack&#x27;s fitness for command, requesting permission to take the &quot;Leopard&quot; boats and the men who wish to leave and head for the Cape, which Jack accepts. Only the jolly boat is left behind. Jack and the crew members loyal to him continue to drift east on the &quot;Leopard&quot;, still rudderless and pumping furiously to keep her afloat. Making adroit use of anchors and a jury-rigged rudder, Jack navigates the ship to safe harbour in a bay of the remote, uninhabited, and poorly charted Desolation Island just as a storm approaches. Despite its name, it is full of fresh food in the rainy Antarctic summer.

The crew repairs the damage to the ship&#x27;s hull but cannot fashion a mounting for a replacement rudder without the use of a forge, which had been cast overboard in the desperation to lighten the ship. Jack fears they will be stranded on the island through the winter. Meanwhile, Stephen is in paradise as he and Herapath collect samples of the local plant and animal life from a small island in the bay. After a few days a whaler arrives in the bay: it is the American brig &quot;La Fayette&quot;, returning to the island to resupply with the edible cabbages growing on shore, which they need to combat scurvy. The Americans have lost their surgeon and their captain is incapacitated by a painful toothache, but they have a working forge. A delicate situation arises when the captain proves hostile to the Royal Navy; sentiment aboard the American ship is strongly against the English, reflecting American–British tensions stemming from an 1807 incident involving the &quot;Leopard&quot; and the USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, the continued impressment of Americans into the Royal Navy, and the awareness that the two nations might already be at war. Sensitive to these issues, Jack asks Stephen&#x27;s advice, who suggests using Herapath as an envoy to Captain Putnam. Stephen follows, and the pair provides medical care to all aboard. Putnam offers to pay but Stephen will not accept payment.

The next morning the forge is on the beach for the &quot;Leopard&quot; use. Stephen advises Jack to resist any desire to press the British deserters serving aboard the whaler. Knowing that American citizens cannot be removed from an American ship without causing a diplomatic incident, Stephen sees a perfect way to speed his plan to use Mrs Wogan to undermine French intelligence, by deliberately letting her and Herapath escape aboard the whaler carrying a packet of falsified information. Wogan is now pregnant with Herapath&#x27;s child. Stephen gives them the opportunity to escape by suggesting that Herapath should perform the last health check on the American ship before it departs. The forge is returned and the &quot;La Fayette&quot; sails on the evening tide. While Jack is distracted by the ceremony of setting the new rudder in place, Stephen and Barret Bonden watch from a distance as Herapath and Wogan slip away in the night to board the whaler.

==Reviews==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; noted the &quot;usual action&quot; present in &quot;Desolation Island&quot; compared to other nautical novels, and praised O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;literate, clear-eyed realism&quot;, which may broaden the audience for the novel beyond the usual readers of a story set on sailing ships. Reviewing a later book in the series for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Anthony Day glowingly recalled &quot;Desolation Island&quot;, writing, &quot;Aubrey&#x27;s relentless pursuit of the Dutch warship &quot;Waakzaamheid&quot; in the roaring ocean below the southern tip of Africa, day after day in frightful weather, stirs the emotions of dread and hope in every reader.&quot;

==Allusions/references to history, culture and geography ==
The &quot;Leopard&quot; stops for water and fresh supplies in Saint Jago, one of the Cape Verde islands, west of Senegal and in Aubrey&#x27;s time a colony of Portugal. In the nineteenth century, the name Saint Jago was used instead of the modern Santiago.

The real-life &quot;Leopard&quot;&#x27;s earlier involvement in the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; Affair in 1807 is described in the novel. The appearance of the American whaler reveals the tension between the English and the Americans on the eve of the War of 1812. O&#x27;Brian based the account of the near-sinking of the &quot;Leopard&quot;, after striking an iceberg, on an actual event involving and her commander Edward Riou in 1789.

The novel uses Lieutenant James Grant as the model for the fictional second lieutenant Grant, who parts from the &quot;Leopard&quot; when the situation is most grim. The real Grant was promoted to commander in 1805, and this story takes place about 1811. Despite his early success as captain of sloops, the real Grant&#x27;s career was not followed by anything more than the promotion to commander, though he was years older than Jack Aubrey, so he provides a good base for the fictional lieutenant who would much rather be the captain.

Captain William Bligh&#x27;s governorship of New South Wales is mentioned as the motive for Aubrey&#x27;s mission, though Aubrey does not reach New South Wales during the novel, nor meets Bligh in any part of the story. Aubrey does tell Maturin how Bligh is viewed by the Royal Navy, the point of which is that his storytelling foreshadows how Aubrey handles his crew after the Dutch ship sinks and their ship hits the iceberg, and how Aubrey handles Lieutenant Grant, turning a potential mutiny into an officially condoned parting of ways. In addition, Aubrey and Maturin speak with Captain Peter Heywood, who served aboard the &quot;Bounty&quot; during the mutiny and was later recovered from Pitcairn Island by Captain Edwards, sent to fetch the mutineers back.

The reason why Bligh is in trouble in the moment of the novel is also described. In short, Bligh faced another mutiny, but this time by staff under him as Governor of the colony of New South Wales. Captain Heywood offers the explanation that Bligh seemed not to understand the reactions of others to many things he said, and then to react too harshly, which those around him perceived as harsh criticism and a miserable life. The Rum Rebellion, also known as the Rum Puncheon Rebellion, of 1808 was the only successful armed takeover of government in Australia&#x27;s recorded history. As Governor of New South Wales, William Bligh was deposed by the New South Wales Corps under the command of Major George Johnston, working closely with John Macarthur, on 26 January 1808. Afterwards, acting governors were sworn in until the arrival from Britain of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie at the beginning of 1810.

From the book, Desolation Island is geographically close to the Kerguelen Islands. However, in a later book, &quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot;, O&#x27;Brian writes some dialogue between Richardson and Aubrey that explicitly states that Kerguelen Island is not Desolation Island: &quot;&#x27;Kerguelen is what some people call Desolation Island, is it not, sir?&#x27; asked Richardson. &#x27;So they do. But it is not our Desolation Island, which is smaller, farther south and east.&#x27;&quot; Despite the dialogue in &quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot;, the description of the harbor where the &quot;Leopard&quot; seeks shelter is taken exactly from Captain Cook&#x27;s description of Christmas Harbor, in the far northwest corner of Kerguelen, which he mapped with the assistance of his sailing master, William Bligh, on his last voyage.

One reader and amateur critic argued that the novel reprised an ancient theme in religion and mythology, that of descent and redemption. In this view, Jack and Stephen are disgraced in the Overworld, Jack by ruinous investments, card games and quarrels, Stephen by losing a patient, falling from favor with naval intelligence, and above all, by losing Diana. They journey to the Underworld, below the equator, to the high southern latitudes, experience epic trials, and achieve redemption at Desolation Island. This paper, &quot;Allegory Wrestling, or Desolation Island Decoded&quot;, was originally posted on the Gunroom email list, devoted to the Aubrey-Maturin series, and presented at a panel on Patrick O&#x27;Brian and the series at a popular culture conference in Boston in 1998.

==Relation to other novels in the series==
&quot;Desolation Island&quot; differs from the prior novels in the series in that the main characters are not back in England or safely on their way by the end of the story. This novel ends with Aubrey and Maturin still on Desolation Island at the end of the Antarctic summer, having just floated the ship and installed the rudder, far from home and from the intended destination for their original mission, with a part of the crew having already separated to try to navigate to the Cape in small boats. The reader does not know if the original mission will be completed or how they will get home to England until the next novel, &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;, or a yet later novel. As in previous novels, several characters are introduced who appear in later novels. Many of the characters appear in the next novel, &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;, and some appear in several novels before their story is told (e.g. Andrew Wray).

==Film and music adaptation==
The novel is one of several novels in the series whose themes were incorporated into the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;.

The American folksinger Jed Marum wrote and recorded the song &quot;Desolation Island&quot; in 2001, based on the book.

This novel was first published by Stein &amp; Day in the USA. Fontana / Collins issued a paperback in the same year, 1979. W W Norton issued a reprint 12 years after the initial publication as part of its reissue in paperback of all the novels in the series prior to 1991.

The process of reissuing the novels initially published prior to 1991 was in full swing in 1991, as the whole series gained a new and wider audience, as Mark Howowitz describes in writing about &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, the fourteenth novel in the series and initially published in 1991.

Two of my favorite friends are fictitious characters; they live in more than a dozen volumes always near at hand. Their names are Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and their creator is a 77-year-old novelist named Patrick O&#x27;Brian, whose 14 books about them have been continuously in print in England since the first, &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; was published in 1970.

O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s British fans include T. J. Binyon, Iris Murdoch, A. S. Byatt, Timothy Mo and the late Mary Renault, but, until recently, this splendid saga of two serving officers in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars was unavailable in this country, apart from the first few installments which went immediately out of print. Last year, however, W. W. Norton decided to reissue the series in its entirety, and so far nine of the 14 have appeared here, including the most recent chapter, &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;.

Making stock involves simmering animal bones, meat, seafood, or vegetables in water or wine, often for an extended period. Mirepoix or other aromatics may be added for more flavor.

== Preparation ==
Traditionally, stock is made by simmering various ingredients in water. A newer approach is to use a pressure cooker. The ingredients may include some or all of the following:

Bones: Beef and chicken bones are most commonly used; fish is also common. The flavor of the stock comes from the bone marrow, cartilage and other connective tissue. Connective tissue contains collagen, which is converted into gelatin that thickens the liquid. Stock made from bones needs to be simmered for long periods; pressure cooking methods shorten the time necessary to extract the flavor from the bones.

Meat: Cooked meat still attached to bones is also used as an ingredient, especially with chicken stock. Meat cuts with a large amount of connective tissue, such as shoulder cuts, are also used.

Mirepoix: Mirepoix is a combination of onions, carrots, celery, and sometimes other vegetables added to flavor the stock. Sometimes, the less desirable parts of the vegetables that may not otherwise be eaten (such as carrot skins and celery cores and leaves) are used, as the solids are removed from stock.

Herbs and spices: The herbs and spices used depend on availability and local traditions. In classical cuisine, the use of a &quot;bouquet garni&quot; (or &quot;bag of herbs&quot;) consisting of parsley, bay leaves, a sprig of thyme, and possibly other herbs, is common. This is often placed in a sachet to make it easier to remove once the stock is cooked.

==Types==

Basic stocks are usually named for the primary meat type. A distinction is usually made between &quot;fond blanc&quot;, or white stock, made by using raw bones and mirepoix, and &quot;fond brun&quot;, or brown stock, which gets its color by roasting the bones and mirepoix before boiling; the bones may also be coated in tomato paste before roasting. Chicken is most commonly used for &quot;fond blanc&quot;, while beef or veal are most commonly used in &quot;fond brun&quot;.

Other regional varieties include:
* Dashi is a family of stocks in Japanese cooking, typically made by briefly simmering a variety of kelp called &quot;kombu&quot; in nearly boiling water, often with other ingredients such as katsuobushi or shiitake.
* Myeolchi yuksu is a stock in Korean cooking made by briefly cooking dried anchovies with kelp in nearly boiling water.
* Glace de viande is stock, usually made from veal, that is highly concentrated by reduction.
* Ham stock, common in Cajun cooking, is made from ham hocks.
* Master stock is a Chinese stock used primarily for poaching meats, flavored with soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic, and other aromatics.
* Prawn stock is made from boiling prawn shells. It is used in Southeast Asian dishes such as laksa.
* Remouillage is a second stock made from the same set of bones.
* Bran stock is bran boiled in water. It can be used to thicken meat soups, used as a stock for vegetable soups or made into soup itself with onions, vegetables and molasses

==Stock versus broth==

== Health claims ==
By the early 2010s, &quot;bone broth&quot; had become a popular health food trend, due to the resurgence in popularity of dietary fat over sugar, and interest in &quot;functional foods&quot; to which &quot;culinary medicinals&quot; such as turmeric and ginger could be added. Bone broth bars, bone broth home delivery services, bone broth carts, and bone broth freezer packs grew in popularity in the United States. The fad was heightened by the 2014 book &quot;Nourishing Broth&quot;, in which authors Sally Fallon Morell and Kaayla T. Daniel claim that the broth&#x27;s nutrient density has a variety of health effects.

There is no scientific evidence to support many of the claims made for bone broth.

== In popular culture ==
Grogu sipping bone broth in &quot;Chapter 4: Sanctuary&quot; (2019), the fourth episode of the first season of the American streaming television series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, became an Internet meme, as the cuteness of the character&#x27;s slurping made two other characters abruptly stop fighting.

<doc id="657130" wikidata="Q3643104" url="?curid=657130" title="The Fortune of War">
<text>The Fortune of War is the sixth historical novel in the Aubrey–Maturin series by British author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1979. It is set during the War of 1812 and much of the story takes place in Boston, Massachusetts.

HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; has made its way to Botany Bay, left its prisoners, and sailed to Pulo Batang, where the ship is declared unfit for war. Captain Aubrey and some of his followers are put aboard the packet ship &quot;La Flèche&quot; to sail home for a new commission, but a shipboard fire ends the months of sweet sailing and brings them into the new war.

&quot;The Fortune of War&quot; contains lightly fictionalized accounts of two actual sea battles in the War of 1812.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins immediately following the events of &quot;Desolation Island&quot;. HMS &quot;Leopard&quot;, her rudder now remounted, sails from Desolation Island to Port Jackson, New South Wales, where she drops off her few prisoners. Captain Bligh has already been handled, so she proceeds to the Dutch East Indies station and Admiral Drury at Pulo Batang. Drury relates that Jack Aubrey and his Leopards have been feared dead since the arrival of Grant&#x27;s party at Cape Town, who had previously abandoned Aubrey and the sinking &quot;Leopard&quot; in the Southern Ocean. The badly damaged &quot;Leopard&quot; is declared unfit for guns due to wood rot and is destined to serve as a troop transport. Jack and several of his followers, including Stephen Maturin, are given passage aboard the courier ship &quot;La Flèche&quot; in order to travel to England, where Jack&#x27;s next command, , awaits him. The rest of the crew is left with Admiral Drury. Stephen learns from Wallis the overwhelming success of his scheme to damage French intelligence sources, and relays the name of a probable spy in the Royal Navy who had been mentioned by Louisa Wogan. Jack and Stephen join a game of cricket, but it ends abruptly with the arrival of Captain Yorke and &quot;La Flèche&quot;, which also brings mail to them. Yorke had visited Sophia Aubrey before leaving England, bringing Jack a personal letter and gifts from her. Jack is moved upon hearing of his wife&#x27;s refusal to believe the rumors of his death.

Though Stephen is greatly concerned with salvaging the numerous specimens he has collected from Desolation Island and New Holland, he quickly warms to Captain Yorke, a philosophical man who travels with an extensive library and a piano in his cabin. At Simon&#x27;s Town, &quot;La Flèche&quot; learns that war has at last been declared between Britain and America. The war has opened with two Royal Navy vessels captured in battles against the fledgling American Navy, which disheartens the sailors. In spite of the depressed atmosphere Jack spends this time of sweet sailing teaching the young midshipmen, while Stephen is engrossed in the dissection of his specimens alongside McLean, the ship&#x27;s Scottish surgeon, though he is concerned by McLean&#x27;s habitual smoking around the jars of preservative alcohol. One night in the Atlantic near Brazil a fire breaks out on board &quot;La Flèche&quot; and all abandon ship to the small boats. The survivors drift through tropical seas for a few hot weeks, some dying of thirst and sunburn, before the boat carrying Aubrey and Maturin is rescued on Christmas Eve by , headed for Bombay and commanded by Captain Henry Lambert.

The watch sees a ship hull-up on the horizon, , which &quot;Java&quot; immediately pursues. Jack and others from &quot;Leopard&quot; man two guns but the fight goes badly when &quot;Java&quot;″s foremast gives way. The American commander makes few mistakes and soon &quot;Java&quot; strikes its colours, yet another major defeat for the Royal Navy. &quot;Constitution&quot; takes prisoners and returns to Boston to refit, having taken part of &quot;Java&quot; for its own repair, then setting fire to her. Captain Lambert dies of his wounds ashore in Brazil. Jack has been shot in his right arm and is too ill to be put ashore. Stephen stays with his patient aboard &quot;Constitution&quot; and works with Dr. Evans, the amiable ship&#x27;s surgeon. All of Maturin&#x27;s collections, except what he noted in his diary by words or drawings, are lost. During the voyage Stephen talks with a French passenger, Pontet-Canet, who was picked up at San Salvador.
By the time they reach Boston, Jack is severely weakened by pneumonia and, with his prognosis grim, Stephen requests that Jack be allowed to convalesce ashore in Dr. Choate&#x27;s hospital, the Asclepia, while waiting for the next prisoner exchange. Jahleel Brenton of the US Navy Department questions Jack in hospital, but Jack puts him off, realizing now why his exchange is taking so long: the Americans and their French allies suspect Jack is the agent responsible for Stephen&#x27;s acts of espionage, among other war crimes. Stephen is reacquainted with both Louisa Wogan and Michael Herapath (who are still apparently ignorant of his espionage) and then meets their newborn daughter Caroline and Michael&#x27;s father George. George Herapath is a wealthy merchant and Loyalist whose trade with China is interrupted by the present war, as a British fleet is blockading Boston harbour. He and Jack quickly take a liking to each other. Stephen also finally encounters his former love interest Diana Villiers, still the mistress of Harry Johnson, a wealthy American slave owner from Maryland who is active as a spy for his nation. Johnson visits Aubrey in hospital, who makes a comment about Stephen that reveals too much to the bluff spy. Stephen suddenly suspects that Johnson and the French agents, Pontet-Canet and Jean Dubreuil, have turned their attention away from Jack and towards him. He asks George Herapath to bring Jack a pair of pistols.

Jack continually watches the harbour from his room in the Asclepia. Pontet-Canet tries and fails twice to abduct Stephen in the streets of Boston. After the second attempt, during which he is nearly shot, Stephen is concealed by Diana in the Franchon Hotel while Johnson is away with Wogan. While Stephen searches Johnson&#x27;s hotel room, Pontet-Canet enters and Stephen clubs him from behind, killing him, then does the same to Dubreuil when he too comes looking for Johnson. Stephen discovers that Johnson had intercepted a letter to him from Diana, and realizes he is now aware of their relationship: Diana wants away from Johnson, and Stephen has offered to marry her to solve her problems of citizenship, to which Diana agreed.

With the French agents&#x27; disappearance not likely to remain unnoticed for long, Stephen sends a note to Jack explaining his predicament and detailing a plan of escape that night. Jack beseeches the help of George Herapath, and together they quietly rescue Stephen and Diana from the hotel and hide them in one of Herapath&#x27;s larger merchant ships. Eager to escape to the British blockade before dawn, Jack steals a small fishing boat and sails out on the ebb tide with Stephen and Diana aboard. They soon meet the thirty-eight gun frigate as she enters the outer harbour on blockade duty, and are taken on board by Captain Philip Broke, Aubrey&#x27;s cousin and childhood friend. Diana becomes nearly catatonic with seasickness. Broke writes a challenge to Captain James Lawrence, the new commander of the thirty-eight gun lying in harbour, to engage the &quot;Shannon&quot; in one-on-one combat, which alas never reaches him. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; nevertheless comes out in apparent pursuit of Aubrey, whose escape the Americans have now discovered, and engages &quot;Shannon&quot;. The battle lasts fifteen minutes, with Jack leading a gun crew, his wounded right arm bandaged to his body, while Diana recovers in the forepeak and Stephen waits below with the surgeon. Captain Broke is mortally wounded, but &quot;Chesapeake&quot; ultimately strikes her colours to &quot;Shannon&quot;, the first significant British naval victory of the war.

==Allusions to history and popular culture==
The two frigate actions depicted in the novel were real events in the War of 1812: HMS &quot;Java&quot; was defeated and burned in a single-ship action against on 29 December 1812, and defeated and captured on 1 June 1813. The fictional Aubrey and Maturin have roles in both battles in the novel, first as accidental passengers on &quot;Java&quot; and then as prisoners of war in Boston who make a timely escape to &quot;Shannon&quot;. The actions are transformed by O&#x27;Brian for storytelling effect. The capture of USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; is discussed in an 1866 source mentioned in the &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; for &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;. The victories of the respective nations greatly raised the morale of their sailors during the conflict. For the United States, it proved that their ships could hold their own against the British, and for the United Kingdom, it proved that American ships could be just as easily defeated as the French, Dutch and Spanish, by employing proper tactics.

===Allusions to literature===
In Chapter 7, when Maturin looks upon the two corpses in the bath, he reflects that &quot;&quot;this is like the end of Titus Andronicus&quot;, a play by Shakespeare where corpses pile up as revenge plays out. Then Maturin realizes that his situation is different, as &quot;he had had to kill or be killed&quot;&quot; by these French spies, one of whom had tortured to death two friends of his.

===Allusions to other novels in the series===
In Chapter 6, Maturin recalls on &quot;the seventeenth of May&quot; that he has been in love with Diana Villiers for &quot;eight years, nine months and some odd days&quot;. He met her in &quot;Post Captain&quot;, during the Peace of Amiens, 1802–1803. Though he seemed to recognize his strong attraction to her immediately in &quot;Post Captain&quot;, if the fiction is literal, he did not allow himself to fully admit it until the fall of 1804. Initially he considered himself unworthy of her, and not in a position to ask her to marry him, which Sophia Williams had encouraged him to do, knowing her cousin&#x27;s feelings.

The American Captain Lawrence is brought to meet Aubrey in hospital in Boston in Chapter 7, to bring greetings from Lieutenant Mowett, himself recovering in hospital in New York. Mowett was injured when was taken by under Lawrence&#x27;s command. Mowett had been a midshipman and poet in &quot;Master and Commander&quot;; Maturin recites some of Mowett&#x27;s lines of original poetry. He was a favorite to both Aubrey and Maturin.

In Chapter 4, Maturin recalls first seeing Pontet-Canet at a restaurant above Toulon when he and Aubrey visited French naval captain and friend Christie-Pallière after leaving England during the Peace of Amiens, in &quot;Post Captain&quot;. Maturin detected that Pontet-Canet had a different regional French accent then, compared to what he affected in this visit to America.

===Quotations===
The changing nature of the connection between the Americans and the British Royal Navy is captured in Aubrey&#x27;s expressions of gratitude to Michael Herapath for his help in their escape from the French spies, out to a Royal Navy ship in Boston harbour. The American Herapath had served as assistant to Maturin on the &quot;Leopard&quot;.

&quot;Jack looked long and hard. &#x27;At high water,&#x27; he said, &#x27;I shall go into her and run out on the ebb. Will you not come with us, Herapath? I will rate you midshipman in any ship I command, and you could be the Doctor&#x27;s assistant again. Things might be unpleasant for you in Boston.&#x27; &#x27;Oh no, sir,&#x27; said Herapath. &#x27;That would never do: though I am obliged to you for your care of me. I have ties here. . . and then, you know, we are enemies.&#x27;
&#x27;By God, so we are. I had forgot. I find it difficult to think of you as an enemy, Herapath.&#x27;&quot; (Chapter 8)

==Reviews==
This book is sharply different from its immediate predecessors in the series, as it tells of escape and shipwreck, the intensity of intrigue during war rather than battles at sea, though much happens at sea.

Jack doesn’t command a ship in this book, how about that! This is a book with a wrecked ship, a long distance open boat voyage with thirst and cannibalism, two naval battles, lots of exciting spy stuff, and a desperate escape. But it’s utterly different from the previous volumes, which have all been genre sea stories in a way this just isn’t. We were comparing this series with Hornblower earlier—it’s impossible to imagine a Hornblower volume like this. ... I very much like the whole intrigue with Johnson and the French and Stephen—it’s as exciting as the sea chases, but in a very different way. There’s a lot of very good Stephen in this volume—and some wonderful Jack malopropisms.

This novel was first published by Collins in the UK. There was no US publisher until W W Norton issued a reprint 12 years after the initial publication as part of its reissue in paperback of all the novels in the series prior to 1991.

The process of reissuing the novels initially published prior to 1991 was in full swing in 1991, as the whole series gained a new and wider audience, as Mark Howowitz describes in writing about &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, the fourteenth novel in the series and initially published in 1991.

Two of my favorite friends are fictitious characters; they live in more than a dozen volumes always near at hand. Their names are Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and their creator is a 77-year-old novelist named Patrick O&#x27;Brian, whose 14 books about them have been continuously in print in England since the first, &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; was published in 1970.

O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s British fans include T. J. Binyon, Iris Murdoch, A. S. Byatt, Timothy Mo and the late Mary Renault, but, until recently, this splendid saga of two serving officers in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars was unavailable in this country, apart from the first few installments which went immediately out of print. Last year, however, W. W. Norton decided to reissue the series in its entirety, and so far nine of the 14 have appeared here, including the most recent chapter, &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;.

<text>Fernão Mendes Pinto (; 1509 – 8 July 1583) was a Portuguese explorer and writer. His voyages are recorded in &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; (), his autobiographical memoir, which was published posthumously in 1614. The historical accuracy of the work is debatable due to the many events that seem far-fetched or at least exaggerated, earning him the nickname (wordplay with the Portuguese verb , &#x27;to lie&#x27;, meaning &quot;Fernão, are you lying? I am lying.&quot;). Still, many aspects of the work can be verified, particularly through records of Pinto&#x27;s service to the Portuguese crown and by his association with Jesuit missionaries.

== Early life ==
Pinto was born in about 1509, in Montemor-o-Velho, Portugal, to a poor rural family or perhaps to a family of minor nobility who had fallen on hard times. Pinto had two brothers and two sisters (and possibly other siblings). In 1551, a brother, Álvaro, was recorded in Portuguese Malacca. Letters also record that a brother died a martyr in Malacca. In 1557, Francisco Garcia de Vargas, Pinto&#x27;s wealthy cousin, is recorded at Cochin.

He was related to the wealthy Mendes family, who were descendants of Jewish Marranos who lived in Portugal (which makes him a relative of the Jewish philanthropist Gracia Mendes Nasi). They had a monopoly on black pepper commerce in Portugal and some of them later moved to Antwerp in Belgium.

Pinto described his childhood as spartan. In 1521, hoping to improve the boy&#x27;s prospects, an uncle took him to Lisbon. There, Pinto was employed in the household service of a noblewoman. After eighteen months or so, Pinto fled. At the docks, he was hired as a ship&#x27;s boy on a cargo vessel bound for Setúbal. On the way, French pirates captured the ship and the passengers were set upon the shore at Alentejo.

Pinto eventually made his way to Setúbal, where he entered the service of Francisco de Faria, a knight of Santiago. He remained there for four years and then joined the service of Jorge de Lencastre, a master of the Order of Santiago and an illegitimate son of King John II of Portugal. Pinto held that position for a number of years. Although comfortable, it held no promise of advancement. Therefore, at twenty-eight, Pinto left to join the Portuguese India Armadas.

== Voyages ==
Pinto&#x27;s travels can be divided into three phases: firstly, from Portugal to India; secondly, through the region of the Red Sea, from the coast of Africa to the Persian Gulf; and thirdly, from east India to Sumatra, Siam, China, and Japan. Finally, Pinto returned to Europe.

=== First voyage to India ===

On 11 March 1537, Pinto left Lisbon for India via Portuguese Mozambique. On 5 September that year, he arrived in Diu, a fortified island and town northwest of Bombay (Portuguese since 1535 but under siege by Suleiman the Magnificent).

Pinto then joined a Portuguese reconnaissance mission to the Red Sea via Ethiopia. The mission was to deliver a message to Portuguese soldiers guarding the mother of &quot;Prester John&quot; (Emperor Dawit II of Ethiopia) in a mountain fortress. After leaving Massawa, the mission engaged three Turkish galleys in battle. The Portuguese ships were defeated and their crews taken to Mocha to be sold as slaves.

Pinto was sold to a Greek Muslim who was a cruel master. Pinto threatened suicide and was sold to a Jewish merchant for about thirty ducats&#x27; worth of dates. With the Jewish merchant, Pinto travelled the caravan route to Hormuz, a leading market town in the Persian Gulf. There, Pinto was freed by way of payment of three hundred ducats from the Portuguese crown. He was made captain of the Fortress of Hormuz and the Portuguese king&#x27;s special magistrate for Indian affairs.

=== Second voyage to India ===
Soon after being freed, Pinto sailed on a Portuguese cargo ship to Goa. Against his will, Pinto was transferred en route to a naval fleet bound for the Mughal port city of Debal (modern Karachi) near Thatta. After enduring battles with Ottoman ships, Pinto reached Goa.

=== Malacca and the Far East ===

From 1539, Pinto remained in Malacca under Pedro de Faria, the newly appointed captain of Malacca. Pinto was sent to establish diplomatic contacts, particularly with small kingdoms allied with the Portuguese against the Muslims of northern Sumatra. In 1569, he discovered an Ottoman fleet led by Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis in Aceh.

==== Patani ====

Following Pinto&#x27;s mission to Sumatra, he was sent to Patani, on the eastern shore of the Malay Peninsula. From there, Pinto made an unsuccessful delivery of merchandise to Siam. The goods were stolen by pirates who were then chased by Pinto and António de Faria. Pinto continued trading operations in the South China Sea, especially in the Gulf of Tonkin.

==== China ====
Pinto entered China from the Yellow Sea and raided a tomb of the Emperor of China. Pinto was shipwrecked, apprehended by the Chinese and sentenced to one year hard labour on the Great Wall of China. Before completing his sentence, Pinto was taken prisoner by invading Tatars. He became an agent of the Tartars and travelled with them to Cochinchina, the southernmost part of modern-day Cambodia and Vietnam. Pinto describes his encounter with a &quot;pope-like&quot; man, possibly the Dalai Lama, who had never heard of Europe. Pinto and two companions jumped ship to a Chinese pirate junk and were shipwrecked onto the Japanese island of Tanegashima, south of Kyūshū.

==== Japan ====

Pinto claimed that his 1543 landing made him the first European to set foot in Japan. He also claimed to have introduced the arquebus to Japan. It is widely accepted now, however, that several Portuguese traders, including António Mota and Francisco Zeimoto, visited Japan a year earlier. The firearm was reproduced and used in the Japanese civil wars. It was known as the tanegashima.

Pinto facilitated trade between the Portuguese and Japan. At one point, he was shipwrecked on the Ryukyu Islands. In 1549, Pinto left Kagoshima accompanied by a Japanese fugitive, Anjirō. He returned to Japan with Saint Francis Xavier, a Catholic missionary. In 1554, Pinto joined the Society of Jesus and donated a large sum of his trading wealth to the mission. In a letter, Ōtomo Yoshishige, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Bungo, offered his conversion and requested Pinto return to Japan. The letter arrived at the same time that Xavier&#x27;s body was being displayed in Goa. Ōtomo did not convert at that time due to internal difficulties but did so later at the time Pinto was completing his autobiography. Between 1554 and 1556, Pinto returned to Japan with Xavier&#x27;s successor. He became the Viceroy of Portuguese India&#x27;s ambassador to the daimyo of Bungo on the island of Kyūshū. Despite Pinto&#x27;s support of the Church in Japan, he left the Jesuits in 1557.

==== Martaban ====
Pinto returned to Malacca and was then sent to Martaban. He arrived in the midst of a siege and took refuge in a Portuguese camp of mercenaries who had betrayed the Viceroy. Pinto similarly was betrayed by a mercenary, captured by the Burmese and placed under the charge of the king&#x27;s treasurer who took him to the kingdom of Calaminham. Pinto fled to Goa.

==== Java ====
On Pinto&#x27;s return to Goa, Faria sent him to Bantam, Java, to buy pepper for sale to China. Once again, Pinto was shipwrecked. He may have resorted to cannibalism before submitting to slavery in order to secure passage out of the swampy Java shore. Pinto was bought by a Celebes merchant and resold to the King of Kalapa who returned him to Sunda.

==== Siam ====
Using borrowed money, Pinto bought passage to Siam where he encountered the King of Siam at war. Pinto&#x27;s writings contribute to the historical record of the war.

=== Return to Portugal ===
On 22 September 1558, Pinto returned to Portugal. Fame preceded him in Western Europe due to one of his letters being published by the Society of Jesus in 1555. Pinto spent the years 1562–1566 in court looking for reward or compensation for his years of service to the Crown. He married Maria Correia Barreto with whom he had at least two daughters. In 1562, he purchased a farm in Pragal. Pinto died on 8 July 1583 at his farm.

==Memoir &quot;Peregrinação&quot; ==
Pinto began his memoirs in 1569. The book was published posthumously by friar Belchior Faria in 1614. Although Pinto did not have the education of contemporary authors and did not reveal a knowledge of either classical culture nor aesthetics of the Renaissance, his experiential knowledge and intelligence enabled him to create a meaningful work. Pinto was critical of Portuguese colonialism in the Far East.

The vivid tales of his wanderings were so incredible and far-fetched as to not be believed. They gave rise to the saying &quot;Fernão, Mentes? Minto!&quot;, a Portuguese pun on his name meaning &quot;Fernão, do you lie? I do!&quot;

The publication may vary from Pinto&#x27;s manuscript (some sentences are erased and others are edited). The disappearance of references to the Society of Jesus, one of the most active religious orders in the Orient, is notable, as there are clear indications of Pinto&#x27;s relationship with the society. Pinto&#x27;s memoirs are just that, his memories of events, giving rise to doubts regarding historical accuracy. However, it documents the impact of the Asian civilizations on the Europeans and is a reasonable analysis of Portuguese action in the Orient (in comparison to Luís de Camões&#x27; &quot;Os Lusíadas).&quot;

The most controversial of Pinto&#x27;s claims is his being the first European to visit Japan and his introduction of the arquebus to Japan. Another controversial claim, that he fought in Java against the Muslims, has been analyzed by historians. The Dutch historian, P. A. Tiele, who wrote in 1880, did not believe Pinto was present during the campaign, but rather that he wrote his information from secondhand sources. Even so, Tiele admits Pinto&#x27;s account cannot be disregarded because of the lack of alternative information about Javanese history during the time. Maurice Collis holds the opinion that Pinto&#x27;s accounts, while not entirely true, remain compatible with historical events. Collis considers Pinto&#x27;s work the most complete European account of 16th century Asian history.

== Legacy ==
In 1978, a crater on Mercury was named &quot;Mendes Pinto&quot; after Pinto.

A high school in Almada, Portugal, built in 1965, was named in his honour and in 2011, a 2 euro coin was issued to mark the 500th anniversary of Pinto&#x27;s birthday.

<text>The Ionian Mission is the eighth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1981. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars.

The plot begins with the marriage of Dr Maturin and Diana Villiers. Soon after, Captain Aubrey takes HMS &quot;Worcester&quot; on blockade duty around Toulon, France, until the ship is sent for refitting. With &quot;Worcester&quot; refitting, he is reassigned to HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; on which he, Maturin and Professor Graham seek a new ally among the pashas on the coast of the Ionian Sea.

In reviews at the time of the 1991-92 reissue of this novel, one reviewer described Maturin&#x27;s &quot;hair-raising infiltration of the enemy coast&quot; and then the mission of the title by Aubrey and Maturin, &quot;to the Greek islands to tinker with the balance of power at the fringes of the Turkish empire&quot;, summing it up as &quot;splendid adventures at a stately pace&quot;. Another finds that time aboard the old ship &quot;Worcester&quot; has little excitement, while tension rises when &quot;Aubrey is caught in a complex net of Turkish politics and rivalries&quot;, in which the fleet Admiral would be just as happy if Aubrey failed.

==Plot summary==

Maturin and Villiers are happily married. After a time together in their new house on Half Moon Street, Maturin settles in his rooms at The Grapes, where Diana comes often, and from which he walks to breakfast with her daily. He has missions to do, and Aubrey needs to get away from his financial problems. Aubrey gets a stint on HMS &quot;Worcester&quot; for Toulon blockade duty. Jagiello brings the Maturins to port in his own carriage, which upsets, making Stephen’s arrival rather last-minute.

While she is doing gunnery practice with gunpowder bought from a fireworks firm, &quot;Worcester&quot; encounters the French ship &quot;Jemmapes&quot;. Worcester engages immediately, not having changed to ordinary gunpowder. &quot;Jemmapes&quot; sees the bright colors as the sign of some new weapon, and sails away. Maturin is injured and returns to taking laudanum for the pain. Some of the crew practice an oratorio while the midshipmen practice &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Passengers are dropped off at Gibraltar and Port Mahon (Graham, professor of moral philosophy), though the parson Nathaniel Martin is aboard long enough for Maturin to discover their shared interest in birds, before Martin joins HMS &quot;Berwick&quot;. &quot;Worcester&quot; joins the squadron off Toulon. Babbington, master and commander, joins the squadron in the Mediterranean as captain of the &quot;Dryad&quot;. Babbington has fallen in love with Admiral Harte’s daughter Fanny, but her father wants her to marry the wealthy Andrew Wray. Babbington figures that Wray and Harte combined got him assigned to blockade duty. Before &quot;Dryad&quot;, the Worcesters see HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; arrive with mail for this fleet, joining it.

Admiral Thornton’s desire is to engage the French in a fleet action. The second-in-command, Harte, has lesser goals. Harte sends Aubrey and Babbington on a mission to the north coast of Africa, with the notion that Babbington will be taken by the French ships in the neutral port Medina. Babbington sees the ships before he enters port and rejoins &quot;Worcester&quot;. Having been told not to fire first at the French, Aubrey enters the neutral port in an unsuccessful attempt to draw French fire. Aubrey leaves port, feeling his image is tarnished. &quot;Worcester&quot; brings Maturin to the coast of France, and waits to pick him up. Maturin&#x27;s mission fails due to other British spies afoot. Waiting for the launch, Maturin meets the other British agent, Professor Graham, who has shot himself in the foot. Maturin hands him over to the Captain of the Fleet to act as a Turkish advisor. Later, the French fleet slips the blockade. Thornton is pleased, but the winds change, preventing a successful engagement. The French do not want battle and return to port. A few shots are exchanged, killing the captain and first lieutenant of HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;, and the &quot;Worcester&quot;, a poorly built ship, is strained beyond usefulness. Thornton tells Aubrey to take her to Malta to refit, then shift part of his crew to the &quot;Surprise&quot; for a mission to the Seven Islands on the Ionian coast. 

As they sail, a poetry contest is set up, with Mowett and Rowan splitting the prize. The &quot;Surprise&quot; takes the blockade runner &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, filled with spices, dyes, and heaps of silver. The silver is shared out at once, and Rowan takes the prize to Malta. Aubrey visits the three beys, Ismail, Mustapha and Sciahan, choosing the last as the best ally for Britain to take Corfu, if not more of the Seven Islands, from the French. Sciahan Bey holds Kutali (a fictitious place), the preferred base for naval operations.

&quot;Surprise&quot; is long in port at Kutali being windbound. The &quot;Dryad&quot; and the gun-laden transports she fetched seem long in coming. Graham engages in a harsh argument with Aubrey. Rumour spreads that Ismail has permission to take charge of Kutali, causing the locals to beg Aubrey to protect them. Graham travels by land to Ali Pasha of Ioannina learning that Mustapha lured &quot;Dryad&quot; and the transports into his port, and is sailing on his ship &quot;Torgud&quot; to take Kutali. The rumour was started by Ali Pasha in his own double dealing, to fire up Mustapha against his enemy Ismail; in the end, Ali Pasha wants rid of Mustapha. Mustapha is on his own, with no approval from the Sultan of Turkey. &quot;Surprise&quot; is ready to sail on the instant, especially as the winds have changed. Aubrey will attack both ships, &quot;Kitabi&quot; sailing with &quot;Torgud&quot;. They meet at sea, with &quot;Surprise&quot; firing broadsides instantly and repeatedly. 

&quot;Torgud&quot; is cruelly damaged, with many dead. Young Williamson loses half his arm. &quot;Kitabi&quot; goes between &quot;Surprise&quot; and &quot;Torgud&quot;, crashing into &quot;Torgud&quot;&#x27;s side. Aubrey boards &quot;Kitabi&quot;, and takes her. Boarding crew proceeds to &quot;Torgud&quot;, jumping across like Nelson. Pullings falls, so Aubrey stands above him and fights fiercely in the close hand-to-hand combat. Aubrey reaches Mustapha, wounded early in the action and sitting. His aide Ulusan surrenders. Bonden carries the swords and ensigns. Aubrey asks Mowett what happened to Pullings, to learn he survived. They return to the &quot;Surprise&quot; before the &quot;Torgud&quot; can sink.

==Allusions to real events==
On 5 and 6 July 1808 the 38-gun British frigate HMS &quot;Seahorse&quot;, Captain John Stewart, fought an action against the much larger Turkish frigate &quot;Badere Zaffer&quot; (of 52 guns), Captain Scanderli Kichuc Alli, and an accompanying Turkish corvette, the &quot;Alis Fezzan&quot;. After a long and bloody action the Turkish frigate surrendered when her obstinate captain was overpowered by his remaining officers. The damaged &quot;Alis Fezzan&quot; escaped during the night. Of particular relevance to the plot of the Ionian Mission is that the Turkish frigate was armed with brass 24-pounder long guns and two immense 42-pounders (the nearest British gun equivalent for the French 36-pounder - French pounds were heavier than British pounds).

In the engagement with the two Turkish ships, Aubrey first boarded the &quot;Kitabi&quot;, which surrendered, then jumped across to the nearby &quot;Torgud&quot;. One of his men said he had boarded like Nelson, referring to Horatio Nelson at the battle of St. Vincent, who took two Spanish ships, jumping from the &quot;San Nicolas&quot; to the &quot;San Josef&quot;. Jack Aubrey&#x27;s model in his naval career has always been Lord Nelson.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the second of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate)&quot; that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Reviews==

One reviewer finds good writing throughout the novel, whether depicting the tedious work of the naval blockade or the quick thinking needed to deal with Turkish politics, while the other reviewer felt that the novel was not interesting until the &quot;Surprise&quot; reached the Ionian coast.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; found this novel to have splendid adventures and the writing at a stately pace, reviewing it at the reissue in late 1991. Aubrey loses favor inside the Admiralty: &quot;He can&#x27;t get things right on shore, but he is quick enough to put &quot;Worcester&quot; to trim, taking slack out of the sails and the crew until &quot;Worcester&quot; is the ablest ship in the line bottling up Napoleon&#x27;s navy in Toulon.&quot; Maturin is now married, but he joins Aubrey for this mission, doing some intelligence work. The old ship &quot;gives up the ghost after one too many skirmishes&quot; and Aubrey shifts to HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; to &quot;tinker with the balance of power at the fringes of the Turkish empire. Splendid adventures at a stately pace.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that Aubrey is caught in a net of Turkish politics and rivalries. First, &quot;there is little excitement as HMS &quot;Worcester&quot; settles in with the other blockading ships, some with crews showing signs of strain from remaining constantly alert but inactive.&quot; &quot;Harte dispatches Aubrey on a delicate mission to the politically volatile Ionian coast.&quot; There he navigates the complex politics, though &quot;Aubrey knows that should he fail, the admiral would like nothing better than to throw him to the dogs.&quot;

The books in this series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian were re-issued in the US by W. W. Norton &amp; Co. in 1992, after a re-discovery of the author and this series by Norton, finding a new audience for the entire series. Norton issued &quot;The Ionian Mission&quot; eleven years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., who asked O&#x27;Brian to write the first book in the series, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; published in 1969. Collins picked it up in the UK, and continued to publish each novel as O&#x27;Brian completed another story. Beginning with &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot; in 1991, the novels were released at about the same time in the USA (by W W Norton) and the UK (by HarperCollins, the name of Collins after a merger).

Novels prior to 1992 were published rapidly in the US for that new market. Following novels were released at the same time by the UK and US publishers. Collins asked Geoff Hunt in 1988 to do the cover art for the twelve books published by then, with &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; being the first book to have Hunt&#x27;s work on the first edition. He continued to paint the covers for future books; the covers were used on both USA and UK editions. Reissues of earlier novels used the Geoff Hunt covers.

<text>Masaki Liu, sometimes referred to as &quot;Saki&quot;, is the engineer and producer operating One Way Studio, a digital recording studio in Benicia, California. Liu has recorded and produced music for many bands, including Five Iron Frenzy, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Echoing Green, The W&#x27;s and Yellow Second.

Masaki is also a musician, playing strings and guitars on several albums. He founded the Instrumental rock band Rivulets and Violets. Rivulets released two albums, &quot;Rivulets and Violets&quot; in 1994 on Eden Records, and &quot;Promise&quot; in 2000 on Five Minute Walk. &quot;Promise&quot; contained some lyrics, written by Masaki and Jen Hollingsworth. Musically the album was said to have a simple sound that obscured its hidden layers of complexity, which was attributed to the fact that &quot;Liu is a studio whiz.&quot; He also played guitar in the band Dime Store Prophets, which released two studio recordings: &quot;Love is Against the Grain&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Fantastic Distraction&quot; in 1997.

<text>Reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms, also known as fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms, denote a voluntary licensing commitment that standards organizations often request from the owner of an intellectual property right (usually a patent) that is, or may become, essential to practice a technical standard. Put differently, a F/RAND commitment is a voluntary agreement between the standard-setting organization and the holder of standard-essential patents. U.S. courts, as well as courts in other jurisdictions, have found that, in appropriate circumstances, the implementer of a standard—that is, a firm or entity that uses a standard to render a service or manufacture a product—is an intended third-party beneficiary of the FRAND agreement, and, as such, is entitled to certain rights conferred by that agreement.

A standard-setting organization is an industry group that sets common standards for its particular industry to ensure compatibility and interoperability of devices manufactured by different companies. A patent becomes standard-essential when a standard-setting organization sets a standard that adopts the technology that the patent covers.

Because a patent, under most countries&#x27; legal regimes, grants its owner an exclusive right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the invention, a standard-setting organization generally must obtain permission from the patent holder to include a patented technology in its standard. So, it will often request that a patent holder clarify its willingness to offer to license its standard-essential patents on FRAND terms. If the patent holder refuses upon request to license a patent that has become essential to a standard, then the standard-setting organization must exclude that technology. When viewed in this light, the FRAND commitment serves to harmonize the private interests of patent holders and the public interests of standard-setting organizations. Many scholars have written about these topics, as well as a variety of other legal and economic issues concerning licensing on F/RAND terms.

== F/RAND as a contract ==

Standard-setting organizations commonly adopt policies that govern the ownership of patent rights that apply to the standards they adopt (the patent policy). In the United States, the patent holder&#x27;s agreement to adhere by the patent policy creates a legally binding contract, as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Microsoft v. Motorola. One of the most common policies is to require a patent holder that voluntarily agrees to include its patented technology in the standard to license that technology on &quot;reasonable and non-discriminatory terms&quot; (RAND) or on &quot;fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms&quot; (FRAND). The two terms are generally interchangeable; FRAND seems to be preferred in Europe and RAND in the U.S.

Some commentators argue that standard-setting organizations include the FRAND obligation in their bylaws primarily as a means of enhancing the pro-competitive character of their industry. They are intended to prevent members from engaging in licensing abuse based on the monopolistic advantage generated as a result of having their intellectual property rights (IPR) included in the industry standards. Once an organization is offering a FRAND license they are required to offer that license to anyone (wishing to access the standard), not necessarily only members of the organization. Without such commitment, members could use monopoly power inherent in a standard to impose unfair, unreasonable and discriminatory licensing terms that would damage competition and inflate their own relative position.

On the other hand, commentators stress that the FRAND commitment also serves to ensure that the holder of a patent that becomes essential to the standard will receive royalties from users of the standard that adequately compensate the patent holder for the incremental value that its technology contributes to the standard. The development of a patented technology typically requires significant investment in research, and contributing that technology to a standard is not the only option by which a patent holder can recoup that investment and thus monetize its invention. For example, a patent holder has the option to monetize that invention through exclusive use or exclusive licensing. Technology owners might have insufficient incentives to contribute their technologies to a standard-setting organization without the promise of an adequate royalty. The promise of a F/RAND royalty address that problem: the patent holder will typically agree to contribute its technology to the standard, thus forgoing the exclusive use or the exclusive licensing of its technology, in exchange for the assurance that it will receive adequate compensation in reasonable royalties.

In 2013, court decisions and scholarly articles cited FRAND commitments 10 times more often than in 2003.

==Definitions==
While there are no legal precedents to spell out specifically what the actual terms mean, it can be interpreted from the testimony of people like Professor Mark Lemley from Stanford University, in front of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary that the individual terms are defined as follows:

Fair relates mainly to the underlying licensing terms. Drawing from anti-trust/competition law; fair terms means terms which are not anti-competitive and that would not be considered unlawful if imposed by a dominant firm in their relative market. Examples of terms that would breach this commitment are: requiring licensees to buy licenses for products that they do not want in order to get a license for the products they do want or requiring licensees to take licenses to certain unwanted or unneeded patents to obtain licenses to other desired patents (bundling); requiring licensees to license their own IP to the licensor for free (free grant backs); and including restrictive conditions on licensees&#x27; dealings with competitors (mandatory exclusivity).

Reasonable refers mainly to the licensing rates. According to some, a reasonable licensing rate is a rate charged on licenses which would not result in an unreasonable aggregate rate if all licensees were charged a similar rate. According to this view, aggregate rates that would significantly increase the cost to the industry and make the industry uncompetitive are unreasonable. Similarly, a reasonable licensing rate must reward the licensor with adequate compensation for contributing its essential patents to a standard. Compensation is adequate if it provides the licensor with the incentive to continue investing and contributing to the standard in future time periods. A licensor which has several different licensing packages might be tempted to have both reasonable and unreasonable packages. However having a reasonable &quot;bundled&quot; rate does not excuse having unreasonable licensing rates for smaller unbundled packages. All licensing rates must be reasonable.

Non-discriminatory relates to both the terms and the rates included in licensing agreements. As the name suggests this commitment requires that licensors treat each individual licensee in a similar manner. This does not mean that the rates and payment terms cannot change dependent on the volume and creditworthiness of the licensee. However it does mean that the underlying licensing condition included in a licensing agreement must be the same regardless of the licensee. This obligation is included in order to maintain a level playing field with respect to existing competitors and to ensure that potential new entrants are free to enter the market on the same basis.

The most controversial issue in RAND licensing is whether the &quot;reasonable&quot; license price should include the value contributed by the standard-setting organization&#x27;s decision to adopt the standard. A technology is often more valuable after it has been widely adopted than when it is one alternative among many; there is a good argument that a license price that captures that additional value is not &quot;reasonable&quot; because it does not reflect the intrinsic value of the technology being licensed. On the other hand, the adoption of the standard may signal that the adopted technology is valuable, and the patent holder should be rewarded accordingly. That is particularly relevant when the value of the patent is not clearly known before the adoption of the standard.

Some interpretations of &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; can include time-oriented licensing terms such as an &quot;early bird&quot; license offered by a licensor where terms of a RAND license are better for initial licensees or for licensees who sign a license within the first year of its availability.

==Excluding costless distribution schemes==

RAND terms exclude intangible goods which the producer may decide to distribute at no cost and where third parties may make further copies. Take for example a software package that is distributed at no cost and to which the developer wants to add support for a video format which requires a patent licence. If there is a licence which requires a tiny per-copy fee, the software project will not be able to avail of the licence. The licence may be called &quot;(F)RAND&quot;, but the modalities discriminate against a whole category of intangible goods such as free software and freeware.

This form of discrimination can be similarly caused by common licence terms such as only applying to complete implementations of the licensed standard, limiting use to particular fields, or restricting redistribution. The Free Software Foundation suggests the term &quot;uniform fee only&quot; (UFO) to reflect that such &quot;(F)RAND&quot; licenses are inherently discriminatory.

==Related licenses==
Related to RAND licenses are RAND-Z (RAND with zero royalty) or RAND-RF (RAND Royalty Free) licensing, in which a company promises to license the technology at no charge, but implementers still have to get the licenser&#x27;s permission to implement. The licenser may not make money off the deal but can still stop some type of products or require some type of reciprocity or do more subtle things like drag out the licensing process.

==Negotiating process==

The negotiating process for FRAND licenses places requirements on the patent owner and the envisioned patentee. The terms for these negotiations were set in German case law in a case regarding the Orange-Book-Standard, and these terms are often used in licensing negotiations. In 2015, the European Court of Justice interpreted FRAND licensing terms in case Huawei v ZTE (C170/13, significantly diverging from the Orange-Book-Standard.

<doc id="657138" wikidata="Q305431" url="?curid=657138" title="The Far Side of the World">
<text>The Far Side of the World is the tenth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1984. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.

The story from &quot;Treason&#x27;s Harbour&quot; has several points resolved, as to the success of Maturin&#x27;s work identifying the French spies, the trap that Aubrey sailed out of but HMS &quot;Pollux&quot; did not, and Aubrey resolving the tension between him and Lieutenant Fielding, who escaped the worst French prisoner-of-war facility. In Gibraltar, Captain Aubrey receives another mission, to sail HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; to protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from USS &quot;Norfolk&quot;, for his first voyage around Cape Horn. Dr Maturin has not yet identified the high-level spy who got away. Unaware, he sends the letter to his own wife explaining his protection of the Navy wife via that very villain. The Pacific Ocean is full of wonders, and prizes, once the Jonah is off the ship.

One review considered this and the previous novel, &quot;Treason&#x27;s Harbour&quot;, to be one novel in two volumes. O&#x27;Brian &quot;writes historical novels without the swashbuckling.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Aubrey meets Admiral Ives, now in Gibraltar, who is pleased with the last mission of HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;, despite Aubrey&#x27;s negative report. Mr Yarrow will rephrase it to make the success clearer to the Admiralty. The admiral is now a peer, his deepest wish, and he is a happy man. Aubrey dines with Laura Fielding and her husband, Lieutenant Fielding, who is now satisfied that his wife is true to him and thanks Aubrey for bringing her from Malta to Gibraltar (though it is Maturin who brought her to the ship, saving her from two assassins). Maturin receives news from his intelligence-chief in London, Sir Joseph Blaine, confirming high level infiltration of British intelligence by the French. Maturin&#x27;s wife Diana has heard rumours of his pretended infidelity in Valletta, Malta, with Mrs Fielding for intelligence reasons. He sends her a letter via Andrew Wray, unsuspecting of Wray&#x27;s role as a French agent. Maturin learns of his success in Malta, destroying the French intelligence network based there, all but André Lesueur taken.

&quot;Surprise&quot; is not yet to be broken up; Admiral Ives sends Aubrey on a mission to protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from the frigate USS &quot;Norfolk&quot;, sailing on HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; on his first voyage around Cape Horn. Aubrey makes all haste to prepare his ship with men and supplies. He recruits Mr Allen, a new master with an in-depth knowledge of whalers, takes on Mr Martin as schoolmaster to the midshipmen, and Mr Hollom, an ageing midshipman. Aubrey wonders if his kindness takes aboard a Jonah with Hollom.

The &quot;Surprise&quot; sails to the farthest east point of Brazil, where the bowsprit is burnt by lightning. During the repairs in Penedo, Pullings sees the USS &quot;Norfolk&quot; pass by. Mrs Horner, the gunner&#x27;s wife, engages in an affair with Hollom, and becomes pregnant. Maturin will not interfere with the pregnancy, so she turns to his assistant, Higgins, who leaves her near death. Maturin saves her life. In the Atlantic, &quot;Surprise&quot; retakes the packet &quot;Danaë&quot;, with Lieutenant Lawrence in command. Tom Pullings sails the &quot;Danae&quot; back to England, after Maturin and Aubrey take possession of a hidden brass box, per instructions to Maturin. &quot;Surprise&quot; rounds Cape Horn with some losses, and then reaches the Juan Fernández Islands to refit and recover. There, the gunner kills his wife and Hollom, and re-boards the ship. Off Chile, Horner learns that Higgins performed an abortion on his wife; Higgins disappears from the ship and Horner hangs himself in his cabin. In the Pacific, with information from a Spanish merchantman, &quot;Surprise&quot; retakes the valuable whaler &quot;Acapulco&quot; with Caleb Gill in command, nephew to the &quot;Norfolk&quot;&#x27;s captain. Mr Allen negotiates with the agent for the whaler in Valparaiso, where the American prisoners are left ashore. Taking the whaler restores the spirit to the crew.

Arrived at the Galapagos archipelago, Maturin and Martin are amazed at the new species they see on land, in the air and in the sea. &quot;Surprise&quot; picks up men from the whaler &quot;Intrepid Fox&quot;, now burnt by USS &quot;Norfolk&quot;. Knowing where the &quot;Norfolk&quot; is headed, Aubrey sails along the equator west toward the Marquesas. Maturin is disappointed and furious that the promise made to let him explore ashore is broken. Aubrey saves Maturin when he falls overboard one evening, but no one misses them until dawn. The two men are rescued by Polynesian women on a pahi, who ultimately leave them on a small island with a fishing line. The launch from the &quot;Surprise&quot; finds them. Maturin is needed aboard &quot;Surprise&quot;, as the group sent to board the pahi was cruelly beaten by the women.

After surviving the tail of a typhoon, the &quot;Surprise&quot; finds the &quot;Norfolk&quot; wrecked on a reef by the same typhoon and her survivors encamped on an island. Aubrey, Mr Martin and some of the crew take Maturin ashore for surgery; he is in a coma since hitting his head during the typhoon. Just as the surgeon from the &quot;Norfolk&quot;, Dr Butcher, prepares to operate, Maturin wakes from his coma. A heavy storm blows the &quot;Surprise&quot; away. Relations between the two marooned groups are tense, because some of the crew on the &quot;Norfolk&quot; were British mutineers and deserters in 1797 aboard HMS &quot;Hermione&quot;; they will be hanged for desertion and mutiny if they are returned to the Royal Navy. One admits this to Bonden. Aubrey tells the American Captain Palmer that he and his crew are now prisoners of war. Both groups are eager to leave this island. Aubrey orders his carpenters to lengthen the launch so they can sail away, pushing the rest to collect food. He sees an American whaler on the horizon. The crew of the &quot;Norfolk&quot; spot the same whaler, cheer at the sight, and then kill their informer. The Norfolks fight with the Surprises. Their cheering stops when the whaler loses two masts and strikes her colours, because it is the &quot;Surprise&quot; that takes her in chase.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the fourth of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (in the Author&#x27;s Note for &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Reviews==

Patrick Reardon, writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, reviewed this novel and the previous one, &quot;Treason&#x27;s Harbour&quot;, as paired, one two-volume novel. He notes that &quot;O`Brian writes about people, not characters.&quot; Though there is action, there are battles, the author gives the reader &quot;the everyday meat of life, about emotions that are deep and complex, and are more important than the plot,&quot; and he &quot;writes historical novels without the swashbuckling.&quot;

==Historical references==

In the Author&#x27;s Note, O&#x27;Brian says that USS &quot;Norfolk&quot; is a reference to the historical expedition of USS &quot;Essex&quot;. &quot;Essex&quot; sailed in South Atlantic waters and along the coast of Brazil until January 1813 when Captain David Porter undertook commerce raiding against British whaling fisheries in the Pacific. Although her voyage was hampered from a shortage of provisions and heavy gales while rounding Cape Horn, she anchored safely at Valparaíso, Chile, on 14 March, having seized schooners &quot;Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Nereyda&quot; along the way. The next five months brought &quot;Essex&quot; 13 prizes.

Porter sailed into the harbour of Valparaíso to avoid a British force of a frigate and a brig-sloop waiting for him outside of the harbour. On 28 March 1814, Porter sailed out of the harbour, but upon sighting British forces began to retreat back into the harbour. He was easily defeated by the opposing captain, James Hillyar. In his final report, David Porter claimed that the British had violated neutrality, conducted themselves dishonorably and inhumanely, and plundered his personal property after the engagement. He stated that the loss of &quot;Essex&quot; was simply due to a series of misfortunes and blamed Paul Hamilton for his all short range carronade armament. He wrote to Secretary Jones &quot;I hope, Sir, that our conduct may prove satisfactory to our country.&quot; Porter finally claimed that the United States had the right to reclaim &quot;Essex&quot; from the British. The only viable parts of Porter&#x27;s report was that &quot;Essex&quot; was only armed with short-range carronades and that he had lost his top-mast. The British had not violated neutrality, conducted themselves dishonorably, nor plundered his personal belongings. There were no further misfortunes aboard &quot;Essex&quot;. In fact, the entire engagement was caused by Porter&#x27;s attempt to achieve personal glory by defeating the British rather than following his orders not to engage them. Porter could have very well not returned to Valparaíso where he would be blockaded, as he knew &quot;Phoebe&quot; and &quot;Cherub&quot; would arrive. The United States by no means had any right to reclaim &quot;Essex&quot; given the circumstances of the battle.

In contrast, Hillyar praised Porter for good conduct and claimed he only surrendered when all his options were expended. Hillyar found Essex with provisions for a six-month cruise. He moved all the ships to Valparaíso and transferred the prisoners to a Spanish prison hulk. On 2 April 1814, Hillyar repaired shot holes below &quot;Pheobe&quot;″s waterline. On 13 April &quot;Tagus&quot; and &quot;Nereus&quot; arrived. On 26 April the prisoners were moved to &quot;Essex Junior&quot; and ferried them away. Hillyar would help reconcile the Peruvian and Chilean governments which the British gave more attention to as the War of the Sixth Coalition had ended and Napoleon was exiled.

The famous author Herman Melville criticized Porter&#x27;s refusal to strike his colors when it became clear that the situation was hopeless, instead of seeking to &quot;crown himself with the glory of the shambles, by permitting his hopeless crew to be butchered before his eyes.&quot; &quot;Nor, by thus continuing to fight, did this American frigate, one iota, promote the true interests of her country.&quot;

==Film adaptation==
The novel provided part of the title and some of the plot-structure for the 2003 Peter Weir film, &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;. The fictional USS &quot;Norfolk&quot; morphed into the fictional American-built French privateer &quot;Acheron&quot;, and episodes also migrated from other books in the series, including &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and &quot;HMS Surprise&quot;. The design and size of the fictional &quot;Acheron&quot; reflect those of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;.

In reviewing the film, Christopher Hitchens commented on the action scenes from this novel that were depicted in the film. He finds &quot;the summa of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s genius was the invention of Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is the ship&#x27;s gifted surgeon, but he is also a scientist, an espionage agent for the Admiralty, a man of part Irish and part Catalan birth—and a revolutionary. He joins the British side, having earlier fought against it, because of his hatred for Bonaparte&#x27;s betrayal of the principles of 1789—principles that are perfectly obscure to bluff Capt. Jack Aubrey. Any cinematic adaptation of O&#x27;Brian must stand or fall by its success in representing this figure. On this the film doesn&#x27;t even fall, let alone stand. It skips the whole project.&quot; He finds the action scenes more inspirational: &quot;In one respect the action lives up to its fictional and actual inspiration. This was the age of Bligh and Cook and of voyages of discovery as well as conquest, and when HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; makes landfall in the Galapagos Islands we get a beautifully filmed sequence about how the dawn of scientific enlightenment might have felt.&quot;

The books in this series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian were re-issued in the US by W. W. Norton &amp; Co. in 1992, after a re-discovery of the author and this series by Norton, finding a new audience for the entire series. Norton issued &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot; eight years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., who asked O&#x27;Brian to write the first book in the series, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; published in 1969. Collins picked it up in the UK in 1970, and continued to publish each novel as O&#x27;Brian completed another story. Beginning with &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot; in 1991, the novels were released at about the same time in the USA (by W. W. Norton) and the UK (by HarperCollins, the name of Collins after a merger).

Novels prior to 1992 were published rapidly in the US for that new market. Following novels were released at the same time by the UK and US publishers. Collins asked Geoff Hunt in 1988 to do the cover art for the twelve books published by then, with &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; being the first book to have Hunt&#x27;s work on the first edition. He continued to paint the covers for future books; the covers were used on both USA and UK editions. Reissues of earlier novels used the Geoff Hunt covers.

<text>AABB (Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies) is an international, not-for-profit organization representing individuals and institutions involved in the field of transfusion medicine and biotherapies.

The association works collaboratively to advance the field through the development and delivery of standards, accreditation and education programs. AABB is dedicated to its mission of improving lives by making transfusion medicine and biotherapies safe, available and effective worldwide.

The association was founded in the United States in 1947 as the American Association of Blood Banks. In 2021, it changed its name to Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies to better reflect its mission and work.

Virtually all blood banks in the United States are accredited by AABB. In addition, AABB accredits hospital transfusion services, biotherapies facilities, cord blood banks, relationship testing facilities, and various other facilities whose work relates to blood and biotherapies. Accreditation by AABB meets the requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) for blood bank, transfusion service, and immunohematology reference laboratory operations.

AABB hosts an annual meeting every fall for the dissemination of research and information for the blood and biotherapies field. The association publishes a monthly magazine, a weekly newsletter, and a peer-reviewed research journal titled &quot;Transfusion&quot;. AABB publishes a variety of other materials for the blood and biotherapies field, including the standards by which it accredits institutions.

Since 1953, the organization has also operated a National Blood Exchange to facilitate transfers of blood products during shortages or when rare blood types are required.

On June 1, 2018, Debra BenAvram, FASAE, CAE, became the association&#x27;s chief executive officer (CEO).

The AABB conducts assessments every two years of institutional member facilities that procure, process, store and/or distribute cellular therapy products to ensure they meet the association’s voluntary standards, including hematopoietic progenitor cell, umbilical cord blood stem cell, somatic cell product and clinical services facilities in the U.S. and worldwide that have earned AABB accreditation.

<text>Self-management is the process by which computer systems manage their own operation without human intervention. Self-management technologies are expected to pervade the next generation of network management systems.

The growing complexity of modern networked computer systems is a limiting factor in their expansion. The increasing heterogeneity of corporate computer systems, the inclusion of mobile computing devices, and the combination of different networking technologies like WLAN, cellular phone networks, and mobile ad hoc networks make the conventional, manual management difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone. More recently, self-management has been suggested as a solution to increasing complexity in cloud computing.

An industrial initiative towards realizing self-management is the Autonomic Computing Initiative (ACI) started by IBM in 2001. The ACI defines the following four functional areas:

; Self-configuration
: Auto-configuration of components
; Self-healing
: Automatic discovery, and correction of faults; automatically applying all necessary actions to bring system back to normal operation
; Self-optimization
: Automatic monitoring and control of resources to ensure the optimal functioning with respect to the defined requirements
; Self-protection
: Proactive identification and protection from arbitrary attacks

<text>In Greek mythology, two sacred mountains are called Mount Ida, the &quot;Mountain of the Goddess&quot;: Mount Ida in Crete, and Mount Ida in the ancient Troad region of western Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey), which was also known as the &quot;Phrygian Ida&quot; in classical antiquity and is mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer and the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil. Both are associated with the mother goddess in the deepest layers of pre-Greek myth, in that Mount Ida in Anatolia was sacred to Cybele, who is sometimes called &quot;Mater Idaea&quot; (&quot;Idaean Mother&quot;), while Rhea, often identified with Cybele, put the infant Zeus to nurse with Amaltheia at Mount Ida in Crete. Thereafter, his birthplace was sacred to Zeus, the king and father of Greek gods and goddesses.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Ida&quot; (Ἴδη) is of unknown origin. Instances of &quot;i-da&quot; in Linear A probably refer to the mountain in Crete. Three inscriptions bear just the name &quot;i-da-ma-te&quot; (AR Zf 1 and 2, and KY Za 2), and may refer to &quot;mount Ida&quot; or to the &quot;mother goddess of Ida&quot; ( Ἰδαία μάτηρ). In Iliad (Iliad, 2.821), &quot;&quot; (Ida) means &quot;wooded hill&quot;, the name recalling the mountain worship which was a feature of the Minoan mother goddess religion. The name is related to that of the nymph Idaea, who, according to Diodorus Siculus, was the mother of the ten Kuretes. Idaea was also an epithet of Cybele. The Romans knew Cybele as &quot;Magna Mater&quot; (&quot;Great Mother&quot;), or as &quot;Magna Mater deorum Idaea&quot; (&quot;great Idaean mother of the gods&quot;), equivalent to the Greek title &quot;Meter Theon Idaia&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Gods, from Mount Ida&quot;). Proclus considered it as the &quot;mount of the Ideas&quot;, whence its etymology.

==Mount Ida, Crete==


Crete&#x27;s Mount Ida is the island&#x27;s highest summit, sacred to the Goddess Rhea, and wherein lies the legendary Idaean cave ()), in which baby Zeus was concealed from his father Cronus. It is one of a number of caves believed to have been the birthplace or hiding place of Zeus. The Kouretes, a band of mythical warriors, undertook to dance their wild, noisy war dances in front of the cave, so that the clamour would keep Cronus from hearing the infant&#x27;s crying. On the flank of this mountain is the Amari Valley, the site of expansion by the ancient settlement at Phaistos. Its modern name is Psiloritis. The surrounding area and mountain used to be thickly wooded.

==Mount Ida, Anatolia==

From the Anatolian Mount Ida, Zeus was said to have abducted Ganymede to Olympus. The topmost peak is &quot;Gargarus&quot;, mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Zeus was located in the Altar of Zeus (near Adatepe, Ayvacık) during the Trojan War. The modern Turkish name for Mount Ida, Turkey, is &quot;Kaz Dağı,&quot; pronounced . In the Aeneid, a shooting star falls onto the mountain in answer to the prayer of Anchises to Jupiter (the Roman equivalent of Zeus).

<doc id="657147" wikidata="Q5532323" url="?curid=657147" title="General authority">
<text>A general authority is a member of the highest levels of leadership within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who has administrative and ecclesiastical authority over the church. A general authority&#x27;s jurisdiction is church-wide, in contrast to the responsibilities of a local authority or an area authority, which relate to a particular area, unit, or department of the church. As a group, the general authorities are often referred to as &quot;the Brethren&quot;. As of April 2023, The LDS listed 95 general authorities.

== Etymology ==
The first scriptural use of the term &quot;general authority&quot; was in minutes of a meeting for the organization of the Presiding High Council in 1834. Though the original minutes did not refer to the term &quot;general authorities&quot;, the revised minutes, which were included in the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, stated that decisions of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles &quot;can only be called into question by the general authorities of the church in case of transgression.&quot; The use of the term &quot;general authorities&quot; at this time and in this context is generally interpreted to include the First Presidency and the Presiding High Council.

== Composition and distinction from general officers ==
By definition, general authorities are members of the church&#x27;s priesthood. In order of precedence, the general authorities include the members of the following leadership organizations:

=== General officers ===
Not all church leaders with church-wide responsibility are considered general authorities. The general presidencies of the church&#x27;s organizations, which are sustained as general officers of the church, but are not general authorities, include the general presidencies of the following organizations:

* Young Men
* Sunday School
* Relief Society
* Young Women
* Primary

The latter three groups are composed of women and represent the only three organizations in which women are given church-wide authority.

Also excluded from the definition of general authorities are members of the Third through the Twelfth Quorums of the Seventy, who are called &quot;area seventies&quot; and have responsibilities relating to a limited geographical area, not church-wide authority.

Until 2004, general leadership for the Sunday School and Young Men organizations had historically been filled by general authorities. However, in the church&#x27;s April 2004 general conference, Thomas S. Monson, of the First Presidency, announced that &quot;a recent decision [has been made] that members of the Quorums of the Seventy [will] not serve in the general presidencies of the Sunday School and Young Men.&quot;

Due to this change, no general organization presidencies are composed of general authority seventies. Rather, the general authorities remain active in general church committees and have less jurisdiction over local stakes. Generally, stake presidents now report to area seventies, who in turn report to area presidencies, which are usually composed of general authority seventies.

Typically, general authorities are given the sealing power, while general officers and area seventies are not.

== Tenure ==
A person is typically called to be a general authority or general officer by a member of the First Presidency or the Quorum of the Twelve. The president of the church and members of the Quorum of the Twelve are typically called for life, although there have been more than a dozen instances when an apostle has been released from his service in the Quorum of the Twelve due to disfellowshipment, excommunication, or resignation.

As with any calling in the church, general authorities and general officers serve &quot;until they are released&quot;. In current church practice, men called to the First Quorum of the Seventy typically remain general authorities for life, but are granted emeritus status in the October following their 70th birthday. Members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy are typically called for a period of five to seven years. When members of the Second Quorum are released, they are no longer general authorities of the church. When members of the presiding bishopric are released, they typically become members of the First Quorum of the Seventy and are therefore retained as lifetime general authorities, including later being granted emeritus status.

== Common consent ==
In the church&#x27;s biannual general conferences, held in April and October, all the general authorities and general officers of the church are presented to the Latter-day Saints for a sustaining vote, in accordance with the church&#x27;s interpretation of the principle of &quot;common consent&quot;. This is a voluntary indication made by each member (usually by raising the right hand) that the member assents to be led by the individuals presented as general authorities and general officers. Members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are always named by name, as are any persons being added or released from a position or any general authority or general officer moving from one organization to another (e.g., a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy being called to the Presidency of the Seventy). Otherwise, the general authorities and general officers of the church are simply sustained &quot;as presently constituted&quot;.

This biannual procedure is dictated by church theology, which states that the church shall be governed by the common consent of its membership. Dissenting votes are rare and have even more rarely prevented a person from holding the proposed position. General authorities and general officers are also assigned to deliver sermons during the two-day conferences.

<doc id="657153" wikidata="Q2740773" url="?curid=657153" title="Black Like Me">
<text>Black Like Me, first published in 1961, is a nonfiction book by journalist John Howard Griffin recounting his journey in the Deep South of the United States, at a time when African-Americans lived under racial segregation. Griffin was a native of Mansfield, Texas, who had his skin temporarily darkened to pass as a black man. He traveled for six weeks throughout the racially segregated states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, and Georgia to explore life from the other side of the color line. &quot;Sepia Magazine&quot; financed the project in exchange for the right to print the account first as a series of articles.

Griffin kept a journal of his experiences; the 188-page diary was the genesis of the book. When he started his project in 1959, race relations in America were particularly strained. The title of the book is taken from the last line of the Langston Hughes poem &quot;Dream Variations&quot;.

In 1964, a film version of &quot;Black Like Me,&quot; starring James Whitmore, was produced. A generation later, Robert Bonazzi published a biographical book about Griffin, these events, and his life: &quot;Man in the Mirror: John Howard Griffin and the Story of Black Like Me&quot; (1997).

==Account of the trip==

In late 1959, John Howard Griffin went to a friend&#x27;s house in New Orleans, Louisiana. Once there, under the care of a dermatologist, Griffin underwent a regimen of large oral doses of the anti-vitiligo drug methoxsalen, and spent up to 15 hours daily under an ultraviolet lamp for about a week. He was given regular blood tests to ensure that he was not suffering liver damage. The darkening of his skin was not perfect, so he touched it up with stain. He shaved his head bald to hide his straight brown hair. Satisfied that he could pass as an African-American, Griffin began a six-week journey in the South. Don Rutledge traveled with him, documenting the experience with photos.

During his trip, Griffin abided by the rule that he would not change his name or alter his identity; if asked who he was or what he was doing, he would tell the truth. In the beginning, he decided to talk as little as possible to ease his transition into the social milieu of southern U.S. blacks. He became accustomed everywhere to the &quot;hate stare&quot; received from whites.

After he disguised himself, many people who knew Griffin as a white man did not recognize him. Sterling Williams, a black shoeshine man in the French Quarter whom Griffin regarded as a casual friend, did not recognize him. He first hinted that he wore the same unusual shoes as somebody else, but Sterling still did not recognize him until Griffin told him. Because Griffin wanted assistance in entering into the black community, he decided to tell Williams about his identity and project.

In New Orleans, a black counterman at a small restaurant chatted with Griffin about the difficulties of finding a place to go to the bathroom, as facilities were segregated and blacks were prohibited from many. He turned a question about a Catholic church into a joke about &quot;spending much of your time praying for a place to piss&quot;.

On a bus trip, Griffin began to give his seat to a white woman, but disapproving looks from black passengers stopped him. He thought he had a momentary breakthrough with the woman, but she insulted him and began talking with other white passengers about how impudent the blacks were becoming.

Griffin decided to end his journey in late November in Montgomery, Alabama. He spent three days secluded from sunlight in a hotel room and stopped taking his skin-darkening medication. When his skin had regained its natural color, he quietly slipped into the white part of Montgomery, and was jarred by how warmly the people there now treated him.

==Reaction==

After his book was published, Griffin received many letters of support. He said they helped him understand the experience. Griffin received very few hostile letters.

Griffin became a national celebrity for a time. In a 1975 essay included in later editions of the book, he recounted encountering hostility and threats to him and his family in his hometown of Mansfield, Texas. He moved to Mexico for a number of years for safety.

In 1964, while stopped with a flat tire in Mississippi, Griffin was assaulted by a group of white men and beaten with chains. The assailants&#x27; motivation was attributed to the book. It took Griffin five months to recover from his injuries.

==Precedent==
Journalist Ray Sprigle of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; had undertaken a similar project more than a decade earlier.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Sepia Magazine&quot; financed the project in exchange for the right to print the account first as a series of articles, which it did under the title &quot;Journey into Shame&quot;.

==Cultural references==
The title of the song &quot;Black Like Me&quot; (2020) by Mickey Guyton was inspired by the book.

Episode 15 of season 4 of the television series &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; was titled &quot;Chick Like Me&quot;. In it, Mr. Feeny discusses &quot;Black Like Me&quot;, which gives Shawn the idea for him and Cory to dress like girls to see if they get treated differently as a topic for Cory&#x27;s column in the school newspaper.

The television drama film &quot;To Be Fat Like Me&quot; (2007) was loosely inspired by the book. It stars Kaley Cuoco as a thin woman who makes herself appear overweight by wearing a fat suit, and films her experiences for a documentary titled &quot;Fat Like Me&quot;.

<text>Popayán () is the capital of the Colombian department of Cauca. It is located in the Pubenza Valley in southwestern Colombia between the Western Mountain Range and Central Mountain Range. The municipality has a population of 318,059, an area of 483 km2, is located 1760 meters above sea level, and has an average temperature of 18 °C.

The town is well known for its colonial architecture and its contributions to Colombian cultural and political life. It is also known as the &quot;white city&quot; due to the color of most of the colonial buildings in the city center, where several churches are located, such as San Francisco, San José, Belén, Santo Domingo, San Agustín, and the Catedral Basílica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, known locally as &quot;La Catedral&quot;. The city&#x27;s cathedral was home to the Crown of the Andes, a 16th-century Marianist devotional object featuring emeralds taken from the captured Inca Emperor Atahualpa. It was sold to finance local health care institutions.

Popayán has been home to seventeen Colombian presidents, as well as noted poets, painters, and composers. The University of Cauca (est. 1827), one of Colombia&#x27;s oldest and most distinguished institutions of higher education, is located here, so Popayán is also known as the &quot;University City&quot;. Nearby is Puracé National Natural Park. The nearest large city is Cali, in the Valle del Cauca Department, north of Cauca.

Much of the city&#x27;s original splendor was destroyed on 31 March 1983, when an earthquake toppled many buildings. Though many were rebuilt and repaired, the heart of the city still has ruins and empty lots. In 2005, Popayán was declared by the UNESCO as the first city of gastronomy because of its variety and meaning to the intangible patrimony of Colombian culture. The culinary history of the Cauca Department was chosen because it maintains traditional food preparation methods that have been passed down orally for generations. In 2009, UNESCO also declared the Semana Santa processions during Easter Week a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Patrimony of Humanity.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Popayán&quot; comes from an indigenous language. There are different theories about the origin of this word, one claims it means: &quot;Po&quot;: &quot;Two&quot;; &quot;pa&quot;: &quot;reed&quot;; &quot;yan&quot;: &quot;village&quot;, or; &quot;Two villages with reed roofs&quot;. Another theory says that the word Popayán comes from the name of the indigenous &quot;cacique&quot;, called &quot;Payán&quot;, who used to live around Eme Hill, nowadays known as Las Tres Cruces Hill. Yet another theory says that according to the historian Arcecio Aragón, the origin of the word &quot;Popayán&quot; is &quot;Pampayán&quot; from the Quechua language: &quot;pampa&quot; (valley) and &quot;yan&quot; (river), thus, the &quot;valley of the river&quot;, where &quot;river&quot; refers to the Cauca River.

== History ==

=== Pre-hispanic period ===
No records exist of the pre-Hispanic history of the indigenous village of Popayán. The city is the home of an ancient pre-Hispanic pyramid known as El Morro del Tulcán, already abandoned when the first Spanish arrived. Analyses of dental samples have revealed that individuals buried there probably belonged to the upper class of their society.

=== Belalcazar&#x27;s conquest ===
On 13 January 1537 the Spanish conquistador Sebastián de Belalcázar arrived in Popayán. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Popayán was administered by an appointed governor under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audience of Quito, part of the Viceroyalty of Peru.

=== Viceroyalty of Peru and Viceroyalty of New Granada ===

Popayán was a very important city due to its location between Lima, Quito and Cartagena. Even after the discovery of the Pacific Ocean, Popayán remained a transfer point for gold and other riches going to Cartagena on their way to Spain. Popayán also served as a colonial mine, and produced various denominations of gold escudo coins and silver reales from 1760 through 1819; it continued producing coinage for the new Republic of Colombia after 1826.

Popayán has been destroyed by several earthquakes. The most recent and destructive lasted eighteen seconds and occurred on 31 March 1983. The reconstruction of the city took more than ten years and today it is still possible to see some lots that have not been rebuilt. The first earthquake seismic design code was established in Colombia as a consequence of this earthquake.

=== Historical city center ===
Popayán&#x27;s historic downtown includes examples of baroque architecture which has been preserved for more than four centuries. The cobblestone streets were almost all paved in 1937; however, a few projects currently seek to recover the old city&#x27;s original look.

== Places of interest ==


=== El Morro del tulcán ===
El morro del tulcán is the main archaeological site of Popayán. It consists of a truncated pyramid built between 500 and 1600 A.C., a period known as late chiefdom societies. To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the city&#x27;s founding, a monument was erected in 1937 in honor of city founder Sebastián de Belalcázar, with an equestrian statue by Spanish artist Victorio Macho.

=== Francisco José de Caldas Auditorium ===
Better known as the Paraninfo, this imposing mid-18th-century building was part of the Dominican order monastery until 1826. It was first built with a mud and straw roof, then reinforced over the years with rammed earth and tile. In 1827 Simón Bolivar declared it a property with historic heritage value, when it was already a two steps hose in front of the Santo Domingo plaza. The last great governor of Cauca, Don Miguel de Arroyo Hurtado, made more renovations and reforms that gave it the most current look. When the building was given to the University of Cauca in the early twentieth century, several changes and additional extensions were made, which recovered all the original spaces.

=== Caldas Park ===
This park was born at the same time as Popayán in 1537, when the track in grid generated around religious, governmental, and founders buildings. Initially it was a marketplace. In 1538 a trap was placed in the center of the park, where Jorge Robledo and Álvaro Oyón were beheaded. The trap lasted until 1766 when it was replaced by a water faucet, which remained until 1805 when a stone pile was put in its place, but it was removed too in 1910 after the inauguration of the monument to Sabio Caldas, a piece by the French sculptor Raoul Verlet, which has stood there since. A replica of it exists in the Plazoleta de las Nieves in Bogotá. Leafy trees were planted at this time. In May 2007 a proposal by architect Lorenzo Castro aimed to expand the pedestrian zone around the park, and in April 2009 the first phase of the work began.

=== University of Cauca ===

The university gathers students from around the country. It was founded in 1827 by decree of General Francisco de Paula Santander. Its motto is &quot;Posteris Lumen Moriturus Edat&quot;. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the main headquarters have been in the Dominican Order cloister, one of the best examples of religious architecture in the city.

=== Clock tower ===
Called &quot;the nose of Popayán&quot; by Guillermo Valencia, the clock tower is a well-known symbol of the city. It was built next to the cathedral between 1673 and 1682 with 96,000 bricks. The clock, made in England, was placed in 1737. Its mechanism operated by the action of two lead weights which were changed by Antonio Nariño in the Colombia independence dispute in 1814, when metal was required to manufacture ammunition.

After the earthquake of 1983, the clock was restored and put back in operation by the same English company that had manufactured it, but it has since stopped working.

=== Humilladero Bridge ===
This bridge connects the central and northern zones of the city. It was built in 1873 on arches of brick and masonry. The designs were prepared by the Italian friar Fray Serafin Barbetti and a German engineer whose mummified remains are preserved in the Archdiocesan Museum of Religious Art. The bridge crosses a fault between the city center and the El Callejón (now Bolivar) neighborhood which was previously extremely difficult to cross, requiring pedestrians to almost crawl on their knees. Accordingly, the new bridge was named &quot;Humilladero&quot;. 
For a long time this bridge was one of the main entrances to the city. The liberating armies crossed it to enter Popayán during the early stages of the struggle for Colombia independence. Its well-planned design and strong construction has allowed the bridge to remain intact through many earthquakes.

=== Calibio ===
This country house was built in the 17th century. On its grounds a battle was fought for the independence of Colombia on January 15, 1814.

== Churches ==


=== San Francisco ===
According to the architect, critic and historian Germain Téllez, the facade of this church is the best example of baroque style in Colombia. In its tower is a bell donated by Don Pedro Agustín de Valencia. This temple is remarkable because of its altar decorations and the proportions of its naves and apse. In San Francisco&#x27;s square stands a monument to local hero Camilo Torres, whose replica is located in the square of the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé in Bogotá.

=== Santo Domingo ===
Late Neogranadino Baroque work, designed by the Spanish architect Antonio Garcia. It has excellent examples of architectures, metal works, and furniture from Quito and Spain schools. His pulpit was designed in the first half of the nineteenth century by an illustrious son of the city, Francisco José de Caldas. Next to this church is the faculty of Law and Political and Social Sciences of the University of Cauca, also in colonial style.

=== San Agustín, church and convent ===
Fray Jeronimo Escobar founded the convent of the Augustinians in the late seventeenth century, whose temple was destroyed in the earthquake in 1736. Then, it was reconstructed thanks to contributions from notable people of the city, but it was necessary to restore it again after the earthquake of 1983. In particular it stands out its altar carved in wood and covered in gold, its expository baroque made in silver and an image of the Lady of Sorrows.

=== La Ermita ===
It is the oldest church in the city and sometimes it served as &quot;Pro Tempore&quot; Cathedral. It dates from 1546 and contains a fine altar discovered after the earthquake of 1983. The principal attraction of this church is the street because its road is made of stones, like old roads in Popayán.

=== Catedral Basílica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción ===

Originally it was a straw hut, but in 1609 it was opened a second cathedral of mud and masonry. The current construction was consecrated in 1906 by Archbishop Manuel Antonio Arboleda, who brings it a magnificent European pipe organ. Its style is the neoclassical, and much of the building was restored because of the earthquake of 1983, including the great dome of 40 meters high, whose restoration was made according to guidelines of the original structure designed by the local artist Adolfo Dueñas.

=== San José ===
It was built in 1702 according to the architectural guidelines of the Jesuits in the American Baroque. It has put up with some changes, for example, the most recent occurred in 1983, when much of the facade which had been covered with paint and lime for at least two centuries, was left on view.

=== Belén Chapel ===
It is located on the hill of Belén, and from the chapel you can see a panoramic view of the city. To arrive to this church, it is necessary to pass through the “quingos&quot;, a road of stone steps that allow a nice climb to one of the viewpoints of the city.

Since 1717 this chapel is in charge of the image of Santo Ecce Homo, patron saint of the city. Next to the church there is a cross of quarry stone of 1789, which are attributed to many legends. The original church was completely replaced by a new structure after the earthquake of 1983.

== Museums ==

=== House-Museum Mosquera ===
This house displays a very interesting collection of colonial art and precious memories of the Mosquera family. This house is administrated by Universidad del Cauca.
It works in the house that belonged to the Mosquera Arboleda family, a recognized family in the history of Colombia, whose members occupied the highest positions of political power, ecclesiastical, military and diplomatic, simultaneously during much of the nineteenth century. The most important were: Joaquín Mosquera, Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, Manuel José Mosquera and Manuel Maria Mosquera. The father of them all, Jose Maria Mosquera y Figueroa, was considered by the Liberator Simón Bolívar as the only person he would choose as a second parent.

=== Archdiocesan Museum of Religious Art ===
The old residence of the Arboleda family, was built in the eighteenth century based on plans of the priest Andres Perez Marcelino Arroyo, and it was acquired by the city in 1974 and renovated for its current use in 1979. Their collections are extraordinary examples of religious art, silverware, pictures of the so-called Quito School and paintings of the colonial period. Monstrances of the collection have such value that they are only exposed to the public for a few days during Easter.

=== National Museum Guillermo Valencia ===
It is located in a mansion on the Próceres street, and it is dedicated to the poet Guillermo Valencia, one of the most prominent members of Modernism in Spanish literature. Its numerous rooms are decorated with valuable works of art and artistic pieces, as well as a collection of hundred of selected books, diplomas, medals and awards that Master Valencia received for his distinguished political life and for its fine literary and poetic compositions. In the park located across the street it stands the statue of the poet, made by the Spanish sculptor Victorio Macho. It has too a family cemetery where the remains of several generations of Valencia are resting.

=== Natural History Museum ===
The museum depends on the University of Cauca. It offers an exhibition of animals, like insects, butterflies and birds native to the region, and a collection of pre-Columbian pottery.

== Arts and culture ==
=== Holy Week ===
Popayán is widely known for the solemnity of its Holy Week processions, during which it commemorates the passion and death of Jesus Christ. Since roughly the mid-sixteenth century - documents in the historical archives of Popayán mention processions in the year 1558 - sacred processions have taken place each night from Tuesday until Holy Saturday, with ancient religious images paraded through Popayán&#x27;s historical downtown streets. They are borne on wooden platforms by means of four projecting wooden &quot;bars&quot; at the front and four at the back. These bars rest on the shoulders of the “cargueros”, responsible for carrying the platforms.

These processions represent episodes from the Gospels, relating the Passion, crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Each representation is called a &quot;Paso&quot;. Since the time of the conquest the pasos have been carried through the streets on the shoulders of the traditional &#x27;cargueros&#x27; in a route shaped like a cross, which takes in the main churches and temples of the city. Since 2009 the Popayán Holy Week processions have been inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

During Holy Week, Popayán is also home to the Festival de Música Religiosa (Religious Music Festival), begun in the 1960s by Edmundo Mosquera Troya. This festival presents choirs, soloists and artists from around the world, specialists in sacred music. 
It is also the tradition at this time of the year to hold art and craft fairs selling handicrafts and commercial products. One of the most important handicrafts samples is Manos de Oro, which displays the works of artists of Colombia.

=== Amo Jesus of Puelenje ===

Amo Jesus Nazareno of Puelenje is a Catholic devotional image located in the church of Puelenje, part of the metropolitan area of Popayán, Colombia. Amo Jesus is the patron of the parish of Puelenje. The image is a polychrome baroque wooden sculpture of Jesus Christ carved in the eighteenth century in the style of the Quito school. The image is processed on the Wednesday as part of the expression of popular piety celebrated in Popayán during Holy Week (see above). A festival in honour of Amo Jesus as patron of the parish is celebrated with fireworks, processions, religious ceremonies and cultural events beginning on the 15th day before the last Sunday in August each year.

=== Fiestas de Pubenza ===
Popayán celebrates these festivities at the beginning of the year, from January 5 to 13. These &quot;fiestas&quot; celebrate the spirit of racial diversity in the country, in the same way as the Carnival of Blacks and Whites, which takes place in the same week, in Pasto, which originally initiated in Popayán during the slavery period as a way of escaping the racial discrimination prevailing at the time.

=== Music ===
It is said that among the original performers there were good music interpreters, excelling in playing the chirimía, that is made up of flutes (transverse cane), guacharacas, drums, castrueras and triángulos, making its appearance in the traditional celebrations of Popayán, especially at Christmas time and at the end of the year.

On the plateau of Popayán, groups of farmers play stringed instruments, composed of three guitars and maracas which have incorporated into their repertoire paseos, merengues, pasillos and boleros in vocal and instrumental form.

=== Gastronomy ===

Popayán has been declared a City of Gastronomy by UNESCO, in tribute to its significant tradition of regional cooking. Typical dishes of the city are a legacy of both Spanish and indigenous cultural interaction, integrating components of local origin with fruits brought from Spain.

The National Gastronomy Congress of Popayán has been held each September since 2003, and in 2005 was recognized by UNESCO as a cultural heritage event of the United Nations creative network. The Congress is organized by the Gastronomic Corporation of Popayán, which has presented seven events which have also featured the participation of various countries as special guests: Peru, Brazil, Spain, Chile, Mexico, Italy and France.

There is also a theater, the Royal Films multiplex in the Campanario Mall, which has four modern 3D digital cinema screens, and a new theater, Cine Colombia multiplex in the Terra plaza Mall (the newest in the city)

In addition there are several film clubs, many of them located within the University of Cauca. The Cineclub La Tuátara runs every Wednesday in the Comfacauca Institute of Technology auditorium (opened 2001), which has established itself as a cultural space for the city.

A very important innovation is the program of the Radio Universidad del Cauca station 104.1 fm, &#x27;Cinema Radio&#x27;, on air Saturdays at noon, in which are created thematic cycles.

<text>The University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo (UH Hilo) is a public university in Hilo, Hawaiʻi. It is one of ten campuses of the University of Hawaiʻi System. It was founded as Hilo Center at Lyman Hall of the Hilo Boys School in 1945 and was a branch campus of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. In 1970 it was reorganized by an act of the Hawaiʻi State Legislature and became a campus within the newly created University of Hawaiʻi System.

The university has been accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission or its predecessor since 1976. It offers thirty-three undergraduate and three graduate degree programs and has about 3,000 students; most students are residents of Hawaii but many are international students.

==History==
Although post-high school non-credit courses had been offered in Hilo as early as 1945, under the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa&#x27;s Adult Education Services, the university was established as Hilo Center at Lyman Hall of the Hilo Boys School. After an attempt to close the school in 1951 by Governor Oren E. Long, Big Island residents, local legislators, and the University of Hawaiʻi Alumni Association led efforts to save its only college to then establish the University of Hawaiʻi Hilo Branch as a two-year campus of the university.

In 1955, the branch moved to its present location on a thirty-acre parcel of land with an enlarged faculty to support its growing student population.

In 1964, University of Hawaiʻi president Thomas Hamilton released a feasibility study on creating a statewide system of community colleges operating as part of the university. The study recommended that the Hilo Branch and the Hawaii Technical School to create a community college in Hilo. However, due to resistance from Big Island legislators, Hawaii Technical School became Hawaii Community College with oversight from the Hawaii Department of Education. Both Hawaii Community College and the Hilo Branch, however, would share the same facilities until 1984.

In 1970, University of Hawaiʻi president Harlan Cleveland led efforts to reorganize the Hilo Branch by renaming the campus to Hilo College and merged with Hawaii Community College. Collectively they were known as the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo with Paul Miwa as its first chancellor.

Amid a failed plan to create a new state college system, of which the UH Hilo would be its &#x27;flagship&#x27;, Hawai&#x27;i Community College was separated from university in 1990. In the 1990s, the former branch campus of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa would emphasize liberal arts, education, agriculture, and vocational programs.

==Academics==
The university specializes in marine science, volcanology, astronomy, and Hawaiian studies. The Masters of Arts program in Hawaiian Language and Literature was the first in the United States to focus on an indigenous language.

==Argument for separation==
There has been a growing movement throughout the last decade to separate the Hilo campus from the University of Hawaiʻi System, creating a &quot;Hawaiʻi State University&quot;. Supporters of the separation argue that the growing Hilo campus is &quot;shortchanged&quot; by its sister campus in Mānoa and that being independent of the system would allow the college to grow faster, better serve the community, and draw in more money from independent sources. Opponents argue that the state is too small for competing university systems and that financial divisions between Mānoa and Hilo are fair, given that Mānoa places emphasis on research and Hilo places emphasis on teaching. There are also concerns that this movement will hurt relationships between the Hilo campus and the rest of the University of Hawaiʻi System.

A bill was introduced in the 2005 session of the House of Representatives of the Hawaiʻi State Legislature to draft legislation to spin off the Hilo campus as the independent Hawaii State University. The bill was approved by the House Higher Education Committee but no hearing on the bill was planned by the House Finance Committee, effectively killing it.

<doc id="657159" wikidata="Q469646" url="?curid=657159" title="Conquest of the Planet of the Apes">
<text>Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is a 1972 American science fiction film directed by J. Lee Thompson and written by Paul Dehn. The film is the sequel to &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1971) and the fourth installment in the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; film series. It stars Roddy McDowall, Don Murray, Ricardo Montalbán, Natalie Trundy, and Hari Rhodes. In the film, set in a world that has embraced ape slavery, Caesar (McDowall), the son of the late simians Cornelius and Zira, surfaces out of hiding from the authorities and prepares for a rebellion against humanity.

&quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; was released in the United States on June 14, 1972, by 20th Century-Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 1973.

==Plot==
Following a North American pandemic from a space-borne disease that wiped out all dogs and cats in 1983, the government has become a series of Schutzstaffel-patterned police states that took chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans as pets before establishing a culture based on ape slave labor. These events were foretold in 1973 as testimony by two chimpanzee scientists who came from the distant future, Cornelius and Zira, before they were killed. Widely believed to be dead, their baby was secretly raised by the circus owner Armando as a young horseback rider. In 1991, now fully grown and named Caesar, the ape is brought to one of the cities to distribute flyers for Armando&#x27;s circus. During their trip, Armando advises Caesar not to speak in public for fear of his life.

After seeing a gorilla being beaten and drugged, Caesar shouts &quot;Lousy human bastards!&quot;. Armando attempts to defuse the ensuing commotion by taking responsibility for the exclamation. He plans to turn himself in to the authorities and bluff his way out while instructing Caesar to hide among the apes for safety. Caesar obeys and hides in a cage of orangutans, finding himself being trained for slavery through violent conditioning. He is then sold at auction to Governor Breck. Caesar is then put to work by Breck&#x27;s chief aide MacDonald, whose African American heritage allows him to sympathize with the apes to the disgust of his boss.

Meanwhile, Armando is interrogated by Inspector Kolp, who suspects his &quot;circus ape&quot; is the child of Cornelius and Zira. Kolp&#x27;s assistant puts Armando under a machine that psychologically forces people to be truthful. Realizing he cannot fight the machine, Armando jumps through a window and dies. When Caesar learns of Armando&#x27;s death, he loses faith in human kindness. In secret, he begins teaching the apes combat and has them gather weapons.

Unfortunately, Breck eventually learns that Caesar is the ape the police are hunting. Meanwhile, Caesar realizes MacDonald is an ally to the apes&#x27; cause and reveals himself to him. MacDonald understands Caesar&#x27;s intent to depose Breck, but expresses his doubts about the revolution&#x27;s effectiveness. Caesar is later captured by Breck&#x27;s men and is electrically tortured into speaking. Hearing him speak, Breck orders Caesar to be killed. With MacDonald&#x27;s help, the heroes manage to trick Breck into believing Caesar died. Once Breck leaves, Caesar kills his torturer and escapes.

To build his numbers, Caesar takes over Ape Management. While setting the city on fire, Caesar and the rest of the apes proceed to the command center, killing most of the riot police that attempt to stop them in the process. After succeeding in this, Caesar has Breck marched out to be executed. MacDonald pleads with Caesar not to succumb to brutality and be merciful to the former masters. Caesar ignores him, deciding to dedicate his life to man&#x27;s downfall.

This is the original uncut ending of the movie. After a bad reception from the first audiences due to its dark tone, the ending was reworked to add a dubbed follow-up to the speech from Caesar:

As the apes raise their rifles to beat Breck to death, Caesar&#x27;s girlfriend Lisa voices her objection, saying &quot;No!&quot;. She is the first ape to speak other than Caesar, but the other apes are concerned about Caesar&#x27;s bloodlust as well. Caesar reconsiders and orders the apes to lower their weapons, deciding that they can afford to be humane, since the fight is already won and they &quot;have seen the birth of the planet of the apes&quot;.

==Production==
J. Lee Thompson, who had maintained an interest in the franchise ever since producer Arthur P. Jacobs invited him for the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, was hired to direct &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot;. Thompson had worked with Jacobs on two earlier films, &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; and &quot;The Chairman,&quot; as well as during the initial stages of &quot;Planet&quot;, but scheduling conflicts had made him unavailable during its long development process.

Thompson staged every scene with attention to detail, such as highlighting the conflicts with color: the humans wear black and other muted colors, while the apes&#x27; suits are colorful. Don Murray suggested to Thompson his wardrobe with a black turtleneck sweater, and rehearsed his scenes after translating his dialogue into German &quot;to get this kind of severe feeling of the Nazis&quot;. Screenwriter Paul Dehn wrote the film incorporating references to the racial conflicts in North America during the early 1970s, and Thompson further highlighted by shooting some scenes in a manner similar to a news broadcast. The primary location was Century City, Los Angeles, that had previously been part of the 20th Century-Fox backlot and translated well the bleak future with monochromatic buildings in a sterile ultramodern style. Also used as a shooting location was the University of California, Irvine, in Orange County. In addition, TV producer Irwin Allen contributed props and clothes to the film: he let the makers of &#x27;Conquest&#x27; borrow his Seaview jumpsuits from &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, brown clothes and computers and cabinets for Ape Management that were used first on &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; and other sets and props from other Allen productions.

Of the five original films, &quot;Conquest&quot; is the only entry filmed in Todd-AO 35 using Arriflex ARRI 35IIC cameras with lenses provided by the Carl Zeiss Group; the other &quot;Apes&quot; pictures were filmed in Panavision.

===Original opening and ending===
The original cut of &quot;Conquest&quot; ended with the apes&#x27; execution of Governor Breck. After a preview screening in Phoenix on June 1, 1972, the impact of the graphic content caused the producers to rework the film, even though they did not have the budget to do so. Roddy McDowall recorded a complement to Caesar&#x27;s final speech, which was portrayed through editing tricks - Caesar being mostly shown through close-ups of his eyes, the gorillas hitting Breck with the butt ends of rifles played backwards to imply they were acquiescing to Caesar&#x27;s directive of non-violence - and assured a lower rating. The film&#x27;s Blu-ray version adds an unrated version, restoring the original ending and many other graphic scenes.

&quot;Conquest&quot; is the only Apes film without a pre-title sequence. The film&#x27;s script and novelization describes a nighttime pre-title scene where police on night patrol shoot an escaping ape and discover that his body is covered with welts and bruises as evidence of severe abuse (in a later scene Governor Breck refers to the &quot;ape that physically assaulted his master,&quot; thereby prompting MacDonald to report that the escape must have been the result of severe mistreatment). The scene appears in the first chapter of John Jakes&#x27; novelization of the film, and in the Marvel Comics adaption of the film in the early 1970s, both of which were probably based directly on the screenplay and not on the final edit of the actual film. An article in the Summer 1972 issue of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; (volume 2, issue 2) by Dale Winogura shows and describes the scene being shot, but it is unknown why it was cut. The Blu-ray extended cut does not contain the pre-credit opening.

===Continuity===
Screenplay writer Paul Dehn, who wrote and co-wrote the sequels, said in interviews with &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; (quoted in &quot;The Planet of the Apes Chronicles&quot;, by Paul Woods) that the story he was writing had a circular timeline:

==Reception==
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s direction furiously propels the action in a compact chromium-and-glass setting—and wait till you see that last battle royal.&quot; Arthur Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;McDowall is extremely good as usual in simian character, and Thompson&#x27;s staging keeps the pace very lively.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 2.5 stars out of four, calling it &quot;excellent in the first half hour,&quot; but found &quot;the concluding action sequences run on too long without any original slashing, maiming, or setting on fire.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;may be the best since No. 1, &#x27;Planet of the Apes&#x27;,&quot; calling it &quot;a self-contained allegory in which man&#x27;s cruelty to beasts becomes symbolic of man&#x27;s inhumanity to man. It is a simple but powerful premise, thoroughly developed with a good balance between dialog and action by Dehn and splendidly directed by J. Lee Thompson.&quot; Clyde Jeavons of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;This comic-book adventure is a far cry from the provocative Pierre Boulle vision so impressively realised by Franklin Schaffner four films ago; and in spite of some crude allegorical pretensions, it can&#x27;t really be considered seriously as more than another excuse by APJAC to get maximum wear out of an expensive set of costumes.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 23 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; is as angry and relevant as any of its predecessors, but budget constraints and a stale script rob this revolution of the scope it requires.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received an average score of 49 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot;

===Box office===
The film earned $4.5 million in theatrical rentals at the North American box office.

==Legacy==
&quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; and its two sequels also chronicle the fall of humanity, just as &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, in a new continuity. Shared plot points include an ape named Caesar being raised by a human man, his rise as the leader and instigator of the ape revolution, his being more evolved than other primates and the &quot;near-future&quot; setting.

<text>Rafer Lewis Johnson (August 18, 1934 – December 2, 2020) was an American decathlete and film actor. He was the 1960 Olympic gold medalist in the decathlon, having won silver in 1956. He had previously won a gold at the 1955 Pan American Games. Johnson was the U.S. team&#x27;s flag bearer at the 1960 Olympics and lit the Olympic cauldron at the Los Angeles Games in 1984.

In 1968, Johnson, football player Rosey Grier, and journalist George Plimpton tackled Sirhan Sirhan moments after he had fatally shot Robert F. Kennedy.

After he retired from athletics, Johnson turned to acting, sportscasting, and public service and was instrumental in creating the California Special Olympics. His acting career included appearances in &quot;The Sins of Rachel Cade&quot; (1961), the Elvis Presley film &quot;Wild in the Country&quot; (1961), &quot;Pirates of Tortuga&quot; (1961), &quot;None but the Brave&quot; (1965), two Tarzan films with Mike Henry, &quot;The Last Grenade&quot; (1970), &quot;Soul Soldier&quot; (1970), &quot;&quot; (1979), the James Bond film &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989), and &quot;Think Big&quot; (1990).

==Biography==
Johnson was born in Hillsboro, Texas on August 18, 1934. His family moved to Kingsburg, California, when he was aged nine. For a while, they were the only black family in the town. A versatile athlete, he played on Kingsburg High School&#x27;s soccer, baseball and basketball teams. He was also elected class president in both junior high and high school. The summer between his sophomore and junior years in high school (age 16), his coach Murl Dodson drove Johnson 24 miles (40 km) to Tulare and watched Bob Mathias compete in the 1952 U.S. Olympic decathlon trials. Johnson told his coach, &quot;I could have beaten most of those guys.&quot; Dodson and Johnson drove back a month later to watch Mathias&#x27;s victory parade. Weeks later, Johnson competed in a high school invitational decathlon and won the event. He also won the 1953 and 1954 California state high school decathlon meets.

In 1954, as a freshman at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), his progress in the event was impressive; he broke the world record in his fourth competition. He pledged Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, America&#x27;s first non-sectarian fraternity, and was class president at UCLA. In 1955, in Mexico City, he won the title at the Pan American Games.

Johnson qualified for both the decathlon and the long jump events for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. However, he was hampered by an injury and forfeited his place in the long jump. Despite this handicap, he managed win silver in the decathlon behind compatriot Milt Campbell. It would turn out to be his last defeat in the event.

Due to injury, Johnson missed the 1957 and 1959 seasons (the latter due to a car accident), but he broke the world record in 1958 and again in 1960. The crown to his career came at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. His most serious rival was Yang Chuan-Kwang (C. K. Yang) of Taiwan. Yang also studied at UCLA; the two trained together under UCLA track coach Elvin C. &quot;Ducky&quot; Drake and had become friends. In the decathlon, the lead swung back and forth between them. Finally, after nine events, Johnson led Yang by a small margin, but Yang was known to be better in the final event, the 1500 m. According to &quot;The Telegraph&quot; (UK), &quot;legend has it&quot; that Drake gave coaching to both men, with him advising Johnson to stay close to Yang and be ready for &quot;a hellish sprint&quot; at the end, and advising Yang to put as much distance between himself and Johnson before the final sprint as possible.

Johnson ran his personal best at 4:49.7 and finished just 1.2 sec slower than Yang, winning the gold by 58 points with an Olympic record total of 8,392 points. Both athletes were exhausted and drained and came to a stop a few paces past the finish line leaning against each other for support. With this victory, Johnson ended his athletic career.

At UCLA, Johnson also played basketball under legendary coach John Wooden and was a starter for the Bruins on their 1958–59 team. Wooden considered Johnson a great defensive player, but sometimes regretted holding back his teams early in his coaching career, remarking, &quot;imagine Rafer Johnson on the [fast] break.&quot;

Johnson was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the 28th round (333rd overall) of the 1959 NFL draft as a running back. Johnson was also selected as a guard by the Los Angeles Jets as one of their two territorial selections in the inaugural 1961 ABL draft alongside Gary Phillips. However, he would never play for either Los Angeles based team or in either professional sports league.
While training for the 1960 Olympics, his friend Kirk Douglas told him about a part in &quot;Spartacus&quot; that Douglas thought might make him a star: the Ethiopian gladiator Draba, who refuses to kill Spartacus (played by Douglas) after defeating him in a duel. Johnson read for and got the role, but was forced to turn it down because the Amateur Athletic Union told him it would make him a professional and therefore ineligible for the Olympics under the rules of the time. The role eventually went to another UCLA great, Woody Strode. In 1960, Johnson began acting in motion pictures and working as a sportscaster. He made several film appearances, mostly in the 1960s. Johnson worked full-time as a sportscaster in the early 1970s. He was a weekend sports anchor on the local NBC affiliate in Los Angeles, KNBC, but seemed uncomfortable in that position and eventually moved on to other things.

Johnson worked on the presidential election campaign of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and on June 5, 1968, with the help of Rosey Grier, he apprehended Sirhan Sirhan immediately after Sirhan had assassinated Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. Kennedy died the following day at Good Samaritan Hospital. Johnson discussed the experience in his autobiography, &quot;The Best That I Can Be&quot; (published in 1999 by Galilee Trade Publishing and co-authored with Philip Goldberg).

Johnson served on the organizing committee for the first Special Olympics competition in Chicago in 1968, hosted by Special Olympics founder, Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the next year he led the founding of the California Special Olympics. Johnson, along with a small group of volunteers, founded California Special Olympics in 1969 by conducting a competition at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for 900 individuals with intellectual disabilities. Following the first California Games in 1969, Johnson became one of the original members of the board of directors. The board worked together to raise funds and offer a modest program of swimming and track and field. In 1983, Rafer ran for President of the Board to increase Board participation, reorganize the staff to most effectively use each person&#x27;s talents, and expand fundraising efforts. He was elected president and served in the capacity until 1992, when he was named chairman of the Board of Governors.

=== Family ===
Johnson married Elizabeth Thorsen in 1971. They had two children and four grandchildren.

Johnson&#x27;s brother Jimmy was a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and his daughter Jennifer competed in beach volleyball at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney following her collegiate career at UCLA. His son Joshua Johnson followed his father into track and field and had a podium finish in the javelin throw at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

Johnson participated in the Art of the Olympians program.

===Death===

<doc id="657175" wikidata="Q3494280" url="?curid=657175" title="Spunge">
<text>Spunge (often typeset as [spunge]) is a ska punk band from Tewkesbury, England. Through many years of touring, Spunge have toured with or played alongside a number of UK bands; and several American bands such as Green Day, Dropkick Murphys and Reel Big Fish; and been supported on a UK tour by Bowling for Soup; the latter of whom contributed backing vocals to the song &quot;Centerfold&quot; on the &quot;That Should Cover It!&quot; album.

In 2019 the band toured the UK supporting Reel Big Fish, playing the same set they recorded for the album Live in &#x27;nam... (Cheltenham)

==&quot;Pedigree Chump&quot; and &quot;Room for Abuse&quot;==
Conceived in July 1994, with almost the same line up as today (the only difference being that Copeland used to double up on bass), the band went through a lengthy gestation period (adding bassist Simon Bayliss in 1995, and replacing him with Martin Holt in 1997), before emerging with the &quot;Kicking Pigeons&quot; EP in 1998. Having sold 5000 copies at pub gigs the band decided that there was enough potential to leave their day jobs, and make the band a full-time concern. Having soon gained a manager in Dave Juste of Birmingham&#x27;s Xposure Rock Cafe (a regular early haunt), Spunge hit the road, and would eventually notch up well over three hundred gigs in just two years.

Less than a year later in 1999, Spunge released their début album &quot;Pedigree Chump&quot; on MoonSka Europe and thus set about introducing the band to a wider audience. Holt tired of touring, so good friend Chris Murphy joined to play bass.

Their second album &quot;Room for Abuse&quot; was recorded at DEP International Studios, and released on Sucka-Punch Records in 2000, featuring the single &quot;Ego&quot; plus covers of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; and Sublime&#x27;s &quot;Santeria&quot;. The album version of &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; – complete with new lyrics from Copeland – was the first cover of a Bob Marley song ever to receive permission to be altered by the Marley family, as Ziggy liked it so much. All this attention brought them to the eyes of B-Unique and a deal was signed in February 2002.

==&quot;The Story So Far&quot;==
The new recording contract led to Spunge&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;The Story So Far&quot;. It spent one week in the UK Albums Chart at No. 48. The first single to be taken from it was &quot;Jump on Demand&quot;. Produced by John Cornfield, &quot;Jump on Demand&quot; reached No. 39 in the UK Singles Chart. It also topped the Kerrang! TV chart for two weeks. The follow-up &quot;Roots&quot;, peaked at No. 52 in the UK chart. However, communication between the band and their record label was not good. Both releases had been delayed after the band had arranged sold-out tours and promotional appearances.

The album, &quot;The Story So Far&quot;, was then scheduled for release at the end of August 2002 on the same day as the Reading and Leeds Festivals which the band were playing. The band then recorded a cover of &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; with Steve Harris, which Alex Donnelly at BBC Radio 1 stated he would &#x27;A list&#x27;. The label again asked for a tour to go with the release, and that was arranged for November and December 2002. The band were in full control of all the promotion for the tour and most shows were sold out with over 15,000 tickets sold to Spunge fans. With no financial support from the label, and no press coverage, the planned single was not released.

Following a meeting in December between label and the band&#x27;s management, Spunge and B-Unique parted company. Despite this the band went on to play the inaugural Download Festival at Castle Donington in July 2003, alongside Audioslave, NOFX and Metallica. They parted company with their manager, Dave Juste, around this time, and decided to manage themselves. They also created their own record label, Dent&#x27;All Records, in 2004. All subsequent recordings have been released on this label.

==&quot;That Should Cover It!&quot;==
On 23 February 2004, the label released its first album, &quot;That Should Cover It!&quot; a collection of covers, previously unavailable live demos and two brand new songs. The album was successful, with sales still continuing.

During 2004, the band returned to the recording studio to record two tracks for the next album, with the intention of producing a video for one of them to coincide with a major tour in October and November 2004. The two tracks were &quot;Backstabber&quot; and &quot;One More Go&quot;. A video was commissioned through Goblin Pictures for &quot;One More Go&quot; and was sent out to several television stations in the hope of getting it played on air. Spunge also decided to put on an all-day gig at Cheltenham Town Hall. Hosted by Dent&#x27;All Records and Spunge, this became Extraction Fest 2004. The show was a success, but the video did not get aired, but their planned autumnal tour with Whitmore and Phinius Gage went ahead.

The band decided to release a full length DVD (&quot;The High Life&quot;) incorporating the video for &quot;One More Go&quot; on 21 March 2005.

==Album re-release and self-titled album==
Rhythm guitarist Wol (Paul Gurney) left the band in January 2006, for personal reasons. Spunge decided to carry on as a four piece.

On 6 November 2006, Spunge released a re-recorded version of their second album called &quot;Room for Abuse 2006&quot; that also included a DVD, which was also a re-release of their first video &quot;Skankin &#x27;N&#x27; Skulkin&quot;.

On 20 August 2007, the band announced it had finished the fourth studio album and would be releasing it on 12 November. The album was self-titled. In October 2007, as part of the promotion for their new album, Spunge released as a free download on their website and Myspace site, their b-side &quot;Happy Ending&quot;. The band undertook two tours supporting the album&#x27;s release.

On Monday 3 September 2011, the band digitally released a new double A single, &quot;Nothing at All&quot;/&quot;Higher Ground&quot;, following recording sessions earlier in the year.

On 25 November 2013 the band released Greatest Hit...S album which is a compilation of their greatest hits voted by fans during the PledgeMusic project. Band said they are letting the fans to decide the track listing for the album. All of the tracks were re-recorded in 2013 for this album and few of them were mixed up a bit. Greatest Hit...S is sold in CD format only by the band themselves at their shows. The digital version is widely available through digital music stores and services.

==Hang On? and Single releases (2014-present)==

Spunge announced through social media that they are making a new studio-album which will be released in digital format on 5 December for everyone who has preordered it from their PledgeMusic event.
The Physical CD will be only available for preorder through PledgeMusic and won&#x27;t even be available for sale at the shows.
This will be the band&#x27;s 8th full-length album and 5th album with new original tracks.

In late 2018 the band released two new singles &quot;Liar&quot; and &quot;Get Out&quot; through the band&#x27;s own label, Dent’All Records. The band announced in an interview that they are writing new songs and instead of a new album release they will be releasing the new tracks regularly throughout 2019 as singles.

On 4 November a new single &quot;No One Said It Was Easy&quot; and a music video was released. The video accompanying the single is filmed and produced by Elliot Withers from Lion Island Media.

In addition to Singles, after their latest album the band has also released 2 Live Albums: &quot;Live in London EP&quot; (2016) and &quot;Live in &#x27;nam... (Cheltenham)&quot; (2019).

<text>A lateen (from French &quot;latine&quot;, meaning &quot;Latin&quot;) or latin-rig is a triangular sail set on a long yard mounted at an angle on the mast, and running in a fore-and-aft direction. The settee can be considered to be an associated type of the same overall category of sail.

The lateen originated in the Mediterranean as early as the 2nd century AD, during Roman times, and became common there by the 5th century. The wider introduction of lateen rig at this time coincided with a reduction in the use of the Mediterranean square rig of the classical era. Since the performance of these two rigs is broadly similar, it is suggested that the change from one to the other was on cost grounds, since lateen rigs used fewer components and had less cordage to be replaced when it wore out.

Arab seafarers adopted the lateen rig at a later datethere is some limited archaeological evidence of lateen rig in the Indian Ocean in the 13th century AD and iconographic evidence from the 16th century. It has been suggested that this Arab use of lateen transferred to Austronesian maritime technology in the Far East, giving rise to the various fore-and-aft rigs used in that region, such as the crab claw sail.

The lateen sail played a prominent part in the shifts in maritime technology that occurred as Mediterranean and Northern European ship-construction traditions merged in the 16th century, with the lateen mizzen being, for a time, universally used in the full-rigged ships of the timethough later supplanted by gaff rig in this role.

== History ==
===Mediterranean origin===
The lateen was developed in the Mediterranean as early as the 2nd century AD, during Roman times. It became common by the 5th century.

The lateen also exists as a subtype: the settee. Instead of being a triangular sail, this has a short vertical luffhaving the appearance of a triangular lateen with the front corner cut off. Both types of lateen were likely used from an early date on: a 2nd-century AD gravestone depicts a quadrilateral lateen sail (also known as a settee), while a 4th-century mosaic shows a triangular one, which was to become the standard rig throughout the Middle Ages. The earliest archaeologically excavated ship that has been reconstructed with a lateen rig is dated to ca. 400 AD (&quot;Yassi Ada II&quot;), with a further four being attested prior to the Arab advance to the Mediterranean. The Kelenderis ship mosaic (late 5th to early 6th century) and the Kellia ship graffito from the early 7th century complement the picture.

By the 6th century, the lateen sail had largely replaced the square sail throughout the Mediterranean, the latter almost disappearing from Mediterranean iconography until the mid-13th century. It became the standard rig of the Byzantine dromon war galley and was probably also employed by Belisarius&#x27; flagship in the 532 AD invasion of the Vandal Kingdom. The fully triangular lateen and the settee continued to coexist in the middle Byzantine period, as evidenced by Christian iconography, as well as a recent find of a graffito in the Yenikapı excavations. In the 12th to 13th centuries the rigging underwent a change when the hook-shaped masthead made way for an arrangement more akin to a barrel-like crow&#x27;s nest.

After the Muslim conquests, the Arabs adopted the lateen sail by way of the Coptic populace, which shared the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition and continued to provide the bulk of galley crews for Muslim-led fleets for centuries to come. This is also indicated by the terminology of the lateen among Mediterranean Arabs which is derived from Greco-Roman nomenclature. More detailed research into their early use of the lateen is hampered by a distinct lack of unequivocal depictions of sailing rigs in early Islamic art. A glazed pottery dish from Saracenic Dénia dating to the 11th century is at present the earliest securely identifiable example found in the Mediterranean.

=== Nile River ===
From the Mediterranean, the lateen sail spread to the Nile River in Egypt, where the lateen-rigged felucca was developed.

=== Diffusion to Indian Ocean ===
The emergence of new evidence for the development and spread of the lateen sail in the ancient Mediterranean in recent decades has led to a reevaluation of the role of Arab seafaring in the Indian Ocean, replacing a belief that this sail has an eastern origin. 

Until about 1500, square rig predominated in the Indian Ocean.This then changed rapidly, with nearly all vessels now being lateen rigged. As Mediterranean hull design and construction methods are known to have been subsequently adopted by Eastern Muslim shipbuilders, it is assumed that this process also included the lateen rigging of the novel caravel.

=== Later development ===

Until the 14th century, the lateen sail was employed primarily on the Mediterranean Sea, while the Atlantic and Baltic (and Indian Ocean) vessels relied on square sails. The Northern European adoption of the lateen in the Late Middle Ages was a specialized sail that was one of the technological developments in shipbuilding that made ships more maneuverable, thus, in the historian&#x27;s traditional progression, permitting merchants to sail out of the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic Ocean; caravels typically mounted three or more lateens. However, the great size of the lateen yardarm makes it difficult and dangerous to handle on larger ships in stormy weather, and with the development of the carrack, the lateen was restricted to the mizzen mast. In the early nineteenth century, the lateen was replaced in European ships by the driver or spanker.

The lateen survived as a rigging choice for mainsails of small craft where local conditions were favorable. For instance, barge-like vessels in the American maritimes north of Boston, called gundalows, carried lateen rigs throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Likewise, lateen sail survived in the Baltic until the late 19th century. Because the yard pivots on its point of attachment to the mast, the entire sail and yard can be swiftly dropped. This was an advantage when navigating the tidal riverways of the region, which often required passage under bridges. The balancelle, a Mediterranean coasting and fishing boat of the 19th century, also used a single lateen sail.

==== The bad tack ====
One of the disadvantages of the lateen in the modern form described below is the fact that one of its tacks is significantly less advantageous than the other, the &quot;bad tack&quot;. Because the sail sits to the side of the mast, on one tack, the mast pushes directly against the sail on the leeward side, where it can significantly interfere with the airflow over the sail. This is the bad tack. On the other tack the sail is pushed away from the mast, greatly reducing the interference. On modern lateens, with their typically shallower angles, this tends to disrupt the airflow over a larger area of the sail, affecting speed.

However, there are forms of the lateen rig, as in vela latina canaria, where the spar is changed from one side to the other when tacking. This way, the rig does not suffer these airflow disruptions that come from the sail pushed against the mast.

The lateen sail can also be tacked by loosening the yard upper brace, tightening the lower brace until the yard is in vertical position, and twisting the yard on the other side of the mast by a tack. Another way of tacking with a lateen sail is to loosen the braces, lift the yard vertical, detach the sheet and tack, and turn the sail on the other side of the mast in front of the mast, and reattach the sheet and tack. This method is described in Björn Landström&#x27;s &quot;The Ship&quot;.

The lateen rig was also the ancestor of the Bermuda rig, by way of the Dutch &quot;bezaan rig&quot;. In the 16th century, when Spain ruled the Netherlands, the lateen rigs were introduced to Dutch boat builders, who soon modified the design by omitting the mast and fastening the lower end of the yard directly to the deck, the yard becoming a raked mast with a full-length, triangular (&quot;leg-of-mutton&quot;) mainsail aft. Introduced to Bermuda early in the 17th century, this developed into the Bermuda rig, which, in the 20th century, was adopted almost universally for small sailing vessels.

==Lateen replacement of square rig==
It is a widespread misconception that the lateen rig replaced square rig because of better windward performance and greater manoeuvrability. A study of the relative effectiveness of the two shows that their performance was actually very similar. These results apply both when working to windward and when sailing downwind. (Furthermore, differences in performance are derived as much from the hull shape as the type of rig.) It is concluded that there was no evolutionary technological development that gave improved sailing performance in the 5th century AD change from the Mediterranean square rig to lateen, and that factors other than windward performance must have dictated this change. 

The Mediterranean Square Rig underwent a simplification in the 5th century AD, with reduction in the number of components. Most obviously, in the archaeological context, this included the absence of brails (and the distinctive lead rings through which these ropes were led). This change is suggested to be on cost grounds, both reducing the expense of a new build and of ongoing maintenance. This would have given some degradation of performance of this type of square rig. Lateen was already available as an alternative and, having fewer component parts, could compete on cost but maintained the performance of the original Mediterranean Square Rig. This coincided with innovation in hull construction methods as the edge-to-edge joining of the hull planking with pegged tenons (a &quot;shell first&quot; construction technique) started to be replaced with the early evolutionary phases of &quot;frame first&quot; carvel construction. This is also suggested to be driven by costs. Therefore the change from square rig to lateen in the 5th century is considered to be driven by construction and maintenance costs, not by any significant difference in sailing performance.

<text>Blair Atholl (from the Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Blàr Athall&quot;, originally &quot;Blàr Ath Fhodla&quot;) is a village in Perthshire, Scotland, built about the confluence of the Rivers Tilt and Garry in one of the few areas of flat land in the midst of the Grampian Mountains. The Gaelic place-name Blair, from &quot;blàr&quot;, &#x27;field, plain&#x27;, refers to this location. Atholl, which means &#x27;new Ireland&#x27;, from the archaic &quot;Ath Fhodla&quot; is the name of the surrounding district.

On 13 March 2008, it was announced that Blair Atholl (together with some other Highland Perthshire villages) would be included in the Cairngorms National Park. This change was made at the request of the people of the town. The Forest of Atholl already formed part of the Cairngorms.

==Blair Castle==

Blair Atholl&#x27;s most famous feature is Blair Castle (NN 865 662), one of Scotland&#x27;s premier stately homes, and the last castle in the British Isles to be besieged, in 1746 during the last Jacobite rising. The Castle was the traditional home of the Earls (later Marquesses, now Dukes) of Atholl. The Duke of Atholl is the only person in the United Kingdom allowed to raise a private army. This army, known as the Atholl Highlanders, conducts largely social and ceremonial activities, and primarily consists of workers on the extensive Atholl Estates.

The Castle no longer belongs directly to the Duke of Atholl, as the 10th Duke, George Iain Murray (1931–96), left the Castle in trust upon his death. His distant cousin the 11th Duke, John Murray (1929–2012), lived in South Africa, and visited annually to review the Atholl Highlanders. The oldest part of Blair Castle, known as Comyn&#x27;s (or Cumming&#x27;s) Tower, a small tower-house with immensely thick walls, is claimed (perhaps dubiously) to date from as early as the 13th century. The majority of the Castle is 16th century in date, though much altered. After the siege referred to above, the upper storey and battlements of the ancient Castle were removed to render it indefensible. A medieval appearance becoming fashionable again during the 19th century, the Castle, which had become known as Atholl House, was raised in height and adorned with battlements once more. The many alterations in the fabric are largely concealed by the white harling (roughcast) on the walls. The collections of furniture, paintings, historical relics, weapons, embroidery, china, Highland artefacts and hunting trophies preserved in the Castle are among the finest in Scotland, as is the plasterwork and other décor of the principal rooms. Thirty-two rooms are open to the public, more than in any comparable stately home.

The Castle sits in extensive grounds, which the Dukes of Atholl have altered and added to over several centuries. Notable among the features are Diana&#x27;s Grove and the Hercules Garden, both laid out in the first half of the 18th century, and rare examples of their period. Both are adorned with lead reproductions of Classical statues. The Dukes of Atholl were early and enthusiastic tree planters, and Diana&#x27;s Grove contains some of the tallest trees in Great Britain. The Hercules Garden, recently restored, is a rare survival of a walled formal garden with an artificial lake and islands, surrounded by plantations of fruit trees. There are several other follies, bridges etc. of various periods.

Also within the Castle grounds is the hamlet and former parish church of Old Blair (NN 867 666), the original focus of settlement in the area before the present village, which was laid out from the first half of the 19th century. The church was dedicated to St Bride and is a probable early Christian site. John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, &#x27;Bonnie Dundee&#x27; was buried in the aisle attached to the now roofless church after the Battle of Killiecrankie, 27 July 1689. The modern railed burial enclosure of the family of the Dukes adjoins the ancient unenclosed churchyard. In the Middle Ages the main road from Atholl to Badenoch, and hence to the north of Scotland, passed through this village and the Minigaig Pass.

In 1946 the first Blair Atholl International Scout Jamborette was held within the castle grounds. This Scout Camp has been held every two years since, with Scouts from across the globe in attendance. The camp was the idea of Jack Stewart, International Commissioner for Scotland before and after the 1939/1945 war, who proposed a smaller international camp than a World Jamboree – a Jamborette.
John Kennedy, the Camp Chief from 1998 to 2010, passed over the role to Andrew Sharkey for the camp in 2012.

Built in 1820 as a private hunting lodge by John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl, the Atholl Arms Hotel and its estate was owned for most of the 20th century by the Stewart~MacKay family (the second-largest employers in Highland Perthshire after the Duke of Atholl). Latterly it was owned by local Conservative politician John &quot;Jock&quot; Stewart~MacKay &quot;MBE&quot; of nearby Killicrankie, who sold it in 1981.

On 13 March 2008, Blair Atholl won the appeal to be in the Cairngorms National Park, making it likely Blair Castle will become a more popular attraction.

==Village==
Until the early 19th century the only building on the site of the present village was Blair Atholl Mill. It began to grow around the present parish church, largely as a planned settlement, when this was moved from Old Blair. The arrival of the railway linking Perth with Inverness in 1863 and the building of the main A9 North Road encouraged the growth of the village, though the A9 has bypassed it since the 1980s.

The Atholl Country Life Museum in the village has displays on the social history of the area. It is open in the summer, with an entrance charge.

A peculiar quirk of the town is ownership of the water supply. As a result of an unusual legal agreement made in 1911 for the benefit of steam trains, the responsibility for the public water supply to the people of Blair Atholl has been held by the railway companies who own the line through Blair Atholl, currently Network Rail. In April 2006, it was announced that Network Rail would finance the cost of connecting the Blair Atholl and Bridge of Tilt (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Drochaid Theilt&quot;) to Scottish Water&#x27;s supply.

==Transport==
The town has a railway station on the Highland Main Line. The main road north from Perth to Inverness, the A9, ran through the village until it was bypassed in 1984.

Blair Atholl Airfield (owned by Lude House) is located to the east of the village, on the northern side of the B8079. Its ICAO airport code is GB-0329. Its single runway, a grass strip, is numbered 12 and 30.

==Jamborette==
Since its inception in 1946, Blair Atholl Patrol Jamborette has taken place every two years in the grounds of Blair Castle. Scotland&#x27;s largest regular Scout Camp is usually attended by around 1,200 participants, half Scottish Scouts, and half Internationals, from countries including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Malawi, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and the United States. The camp is divided into six sub-camps: MacDonald, Maclean, Murray, Morrison, Robertson and Stewart. The 2010 camp saw John Kennedy retire as the camp chief, after 12 years in the role, handing over to Andrew Sharkey who led the next Jamborette in 2012. In recognition of Kennedy&#x27;s outstanding services, Eleanor Lyall, the Chief Commissioner for Scotland, presented him with the Silver Wolf, the highest award in adult Scouting. The Jamborette of 2020 was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

<doc id="657187" wikidata="Q2738570" url="?curid=657187" title="Mobile computing">
<text>Mobile computing is human–computer interaction in which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage and allow for transmission of data, which can include voice and video transmissions. Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware, and mobile software. Communication issues include ad hoc networks and infrastructure networks as well as communication properties, protocols, data formats, and concrete technologies. Hardware includes mobile devices or device components. Mobile software deals with the characteristics and requirements of mobile applications.

== Main principles ==
* Portability: Devices/nodes connected within the mobile computing system should facilitate mobility. These devices may have limited device capabilities and limited power supply but should have a sufficient processing capability and physical portability to operate in a movable environment.
* Connectivity: This defines the quality of service (QoS) of the network connectivity. In a mobile computing system, the network availability is expected to be maintained at a high level with a minimal amount of lag/downtime without being affected by the mobility of the connected nodes.
* Interactivity: The nodes belonging to a mobile computing system are connected with one another to communicate and collaborate through active transactions of data.
* Individuality: A portable device or a mobile node connected to a mobile network often denotes an individual; a mobile computing system should be able to adopt the technology to cater to the individual needs and also to obtain contextual information of each node.

== Devices ==
Some of the most common forms of mobile computing devices are as given below:

* Portable computers, compact, lightweight units including a full character set keyboard and primarily intended as hosts for software that may be parameterized, such as laptops/desktops, smartphones/tablets, etc.

* Smart cards that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel, and secure area access.

* Mobile phones, telephony devices which can call from a distance through cellular networking technology.

* Wearable computers, mostly limited to functional keys and primarily intended for the incorporation of software agents, such as bracelets, keyless implants, etc.

These classes are expected to endure and to complement each other, none replacing another completely.

Other types of mobile computers have been introduced since the 1990s, including the:
* Portable computer
* Personal digital assistant, enterprise digital assistant
* Ultra-Mobile PC
* Laptop
* Tablet computer
* Wearable computer
* E-reader
* Carputer
* Handheld PC

==Limitations==
* Expandability, replaceability and modularity: In contrast to the common traditional motherboard-based PC the SoC architecture in which they are embedded makes these features impossible.
* Lack of a BIOS: As most smart devices lack a proper BIOS, their bootloading capabilities are limited as they can only boot into the single operative system with which it came, in contrast with the PC BIOS model.
* Range and bandwidth: Mobile Internet access is generally slower than direct cable connections, using technologies such as GPRS and EDGE, and more recently HSDPA, HSUPA, 3G and 4G networks and also the proposed 5G network. These networks are usually available within a range of commercial cell phone towers. High-speed network wireless LANs are inexpensive but have a very limited range.
* Security standards: When working mobile, one is dependent on public networks, requiring careful use of VPN. Security is a major concern while concerning the mobile computing standards on the fleet. One can easily attack the VPN through a huge number of networks interconnected through the line.
* Power consumption: When a power outlet or portable generator is not available, mobile computers must rely entirely on battery power. Combined with the compact size of many mobile devices, this often means unusually expensive batteries must be used to obtain the necessary battery life.
* Transmission interferences: Weather, terrain, and the range from the nearest signal point can all interfere with signal reception. Reception in tunnels, some buildings, and rural areas is often poor.
* Potential health hazards: People who use mobile devices while driving are often distracted from driving and are thus assumed more likely to be involved in traffic accidents. (While this may seem obvious, there is considerable discussion about whether banning mobile device use while driving reduces accidents.) Cell phones may interfere with sensitive medical devices. Questions concerning mobile phone radiation and health have been raised. 
* Human interface with device: Screens and keyboards tend to be small, which may make them hard to use. Alternate input methods such as speech or handwriting recognition require training.

==In-vehicle computing and fleet computing==

Many commercial and government field forces deploy a rugged portable computer with their fleet of vehicles. This requires the units to be anchored to the vehicle for driver safety, device security, and ergonomics. Rugged computers are rated for severe vibration associated with large service vehicles and off-road driving and the harsh environmental conditions of constant professional use such as in emergency medical services, fire, and public safety.

Other elements affecting function in the vehicle:
* Operating temperature: A vehicle cabin can often experience temperature swings from . Computers typically must be able to withstand these temperatures while operating. Typical fan-based cooling has stated limits of of ambient temperature and temperatures below freezing require localized heaters to bring components up to operating temperature (based on independent studies by the SRI Group and by Panasonic R&amp;D).
* Vibration can decrease the life expectancy of computer components, notably rotational storage such as HDDs.
* Visibility of standard screens becomes an issue in bright sunlight.
* Touchscreen users easily interact with the units in the field without removing gloves.
* High-temperature battery settings: Lithium-ion batteries are sensitive to high-temperature conditions for charging. A computer designed for the mobile environment should be designed with a high-temperature charging function that limits the charge to 85% or less of capacity.
* External antenna connections go through the typical metal cabins of vehicles which would block wireless reception and take advantage of much more capable external communication and navigation equipment.

==Security issues involved in mobile==

Mobile security has become increasingly important in mobile computing. It is of particular concern as it relates to the security of personal information now stored on the smartphone. Mobile applications might copy user data from these devices to a remote server without the users’ permission and often without the users’ consent. The user profiles automatically created in the cloud for smartphone users raise privacy concerns on all major platforms, in terms of, including, but not limited to, location tracking and personal data collection, regardless of user settings on the device.

More and more users and businesses use smartphones as a means of planning and organizing their work and private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of information systems and therefore they have become the source of new risks. Indeed, smartphones collect and compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the privacy of the user and the intellectual property of the company. 
All smartphones are preferred targets of attacks. These attacks exploit weaknesses related to smartphones that can come from means of wireless telecommunication like WiFi networks and GSM. There are also attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities from both the web browser and operating system. Finally, there are forms of malicious software that rely on the weak knowledge of average users.

Different security counter-measures are being developed and applied to smartphones, from security in different layers of software to the dissemination of information to end-users. There are good practices to be observed at all levels, from design to use, through the development of operating systems, software layers, and downloadable apps.

==Portable computing devices==

Several categories of portable computing devices can run on batteries but are not usually classified as laptops: portable computers, PDAs, ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs), tablets, and smartphones.

* A portable computer is a general-purpose computer that can be easily moved from place to place, but cannot be used while in transit, usually because it requires some &quot;setting-up&quot; and an AC power source. The most famous example is Osborne 1. Portable computers are also called a &quot;transportable&quot; or a &quot;luggable&quot; PC.
* A personal digital assistant (PDA) is a small, usually pocket-sized, computer with limited functionality. It is intended to supplement and to synchronize with a desktop computer, giving access to contacts, address book, notes, e-mail, and other features.
* An ultra mobile PC is a full-featured, PDA-sized computer running a general-purpose operating system.
* Phones, tablets: a slate tablet is shaped like a paper notebook. Smartphones are the same devices as tablets, however, the only difference with smartphones is that they are much smaller and pocketable. Instead of a physical keyboard, these devices have a touchscreen including a combination of a virtual keyboard but can also link to a physical keyboard via wireless Bluetooth or USB. These devices include features other computer systems would not be able to incorporate, such as built-in cameras, because of their portability - although some laptops possess camera integration, and desktops and laptops can connect to a webcam by way of USB.
* A carputer is installed in an automobile. It operates as a wireless computer, sound system, GPS, and DVD player. It also contains word processing software and is Bluetooth compatible.
* A Pentop (discontinued) is a computing device the size and shape of a pen. It functions as a writing utensil, MP3 player, language translator, digital storage device, and calculator.
* An application-specific computer is one that is tailored to a particular application. For example, Ferranti introduced a handheld application-specific mobile computer (the MRT-100) in the form of a clipboard for conducting opinion polls.

Boundaries that separate these categories are blurry at times. For example, the OQO UMPC is also a PDA-sized tablet PC; the Apple eMate had the clamshell form factor of a laptop but ran PDA software. The HP Omnibook line of laptops included some devices small enough to be called ultra mobile PCs. The hardware of the Nokia 770 internet tablet is essentially the same as that of a PDA such as the Zaurus 6000; the only reason it&#x27;s not called a PDA is that it does not have PIM software. On the other hand, both the 770 and the Zaurus can run some desktop Linux software, usually with modifications.

==Mobile data communication==
Wireless data connections used in mobile computing take three general forms. Cellular data service uses technologies GSM, CDMA or GPRS, 3G networks such as W-CDMA, EDGE or CDMA2000. and more recently 4G and 5G networks. These networks are usually available within range of commercial cell towers. Wi-Fi connections offer higher performance, may be either on a private business network or accessed through public hotspots, and have a typical range of 100 feet indoors and up to 1000 feet outdoors. Satellite Internet access covers areas where cellular and Wi-Fi are not available and may be set up anywhere the user has a line of sight to the satellite&#x27;s location, which for satellites in geostationary orbit means having an unobstructed view of the southern sky. Some enterprise deployments combine networks from multiple cellular networks or use a mix of cellular, Wi-Fi and satellite. When using a mix of networks, a mobile virtual private network (mobile VPN) not only handles the security concerns, but also performs the multiple network logins automatically and keeps the application connections alive to prevent crashes or data loss during network transitions or coverage loss.

<text>Penha Convent (Portuguese: Convento da Penha) is a convent in Vila Velha, Brazil, on the top of a high mountain overlooking the cities of Vitória and Vila Velha. Founded in approximately 1558 by Pedro Palácios, today it is home to Espírito Santo&#x27;s Patron Saint, Our Mother of Penha. Many believers make pilgrimages to this site which is surrounded by a green haven of forest. Due to its location between two large urban areas, it is also a very much sought-after leisure spot on weekends and holidays. It is considered one of the main tourist attractions of the Brazilian Southeast state of Espírito Santo.

Every year, there is an important celebration to the Saint where believers dedicate their miles praying and thanking the Saint. Some have traveled from all over Brazil in order to get there.

The men usually start their walk from the Capital Vitoria and finish at the Convent in Vila Velha. The women also pay their respects and walk from the closest Church (Santuario) up to the Convent. Inside the Convent there are millions of thank you notes from people that claim to have been cured by Nossa Senhora da Penha. They have left many of their notes along with their old handicapped chairs and much more. The view from the Convent is one of the most beautiful views. Being able to see the Island of Vitoria and the City of Vila Velha and one of the most beautiful beaches along the coast of Brazil called Praia da Costa. Where at the end of the beach, you can also see the house of the Governor.

==Annual state meeting of the Terço dos Homens movement==

<doc id="657196" wikidata="Q10151" url="?curid=657196" title="Eurovision Song Contest 2005">
<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 2005 was the 50th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Kyiv, Ukraine, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Wild Dances&quot; by Ruslana. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster National Television Company of Ukraine (NTU), the contest was held at the Palace of Sports, and consisted of a semi-final on 19 May, and a final on 21 May 2005. The two live shows were presented by Ukrainian television presenters Maria Efrosinina and Pavlo Shylko.

Thirty-nine countries participated in the contest, three more than the previous record of thirty-six, that took part the year before. Bulgaria and Moldova made their first participation this year, while Hungary returned to the contest after a six-year absence, having last taken part in .

The winner was with the song &quot;My Number One&quot;, performed by Helena Paparizou and written by Manos Psaltakis, Christos Dantis and Natalia Germanou. This was Greece&#x27;s first victory in the contest after 31 years of participation. Malta, Romania, Israel and Latvia rounded out the top five. Malta equalled their best result from , while Romania achieved their best result in their Eurovision history. Unusually, all &quot;Big Four&quot; countries (France, Germany, Spain and United Kingdom) ended up as the &quot;Last Four&quot;, all placing in the bottom four positions in the final.

==Location==

Kyiv is the capital and largest city of Ukraine, located in the north central part of the country on the Dnieper. The Palace of Sports, a multi-purpose indoor arena, was confirmed by officials as the host venue on 6 September 2004. However, in order to host the contest, the facilities had been brought up to the standard required by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

At the end of December 2004, work began on the renovation 
of the hall, for which approximately 4 million francs were allocated. Renovation works were to be finished by 20 April, however, they were completed at the beginning of May. The arena could accommodate over 5,000 seated spectators. Additionally 2,000 press delegates were catered for.

Hotel rooms were scarce as the contest organisers asked the Ukrainian government to put a block on bookings they did not control themselves through official delegation allocations or tour packages: this led to many people&#x27;s hotel bookings being cancelled.

Organizers hoped that by hosting Eurovision, it would boost Ukraine&#x27;s image abroad and increase tourism, while the country&#x27;s new government hoped that it would also give a modest boost to the long-term goal of acquiring European Union membership.

==Participating countries==
Thirty-nine countries participated in the 2005 contest. Hungary returned to the contest after a six-year absence, last competing in 1998. Bulgaria and Moldova competed in the contest for the first time.

=== Returning artists ===


=== Other countries ===
==== Active EBU members ====
 broadcaster Czech Television initially applied to participate in the 2005 contest; however, the broadcaster reconsidered débuting in the contest and later withdrew their application. broadcaster Télé Liban initially confirmed Lebanon&#x27;s début in the contest and selected the song &quot;Quand tout s&#x27;enfuit&quot; performed by Aline Lahoud as their entry; however, the broadcaster announced their withdrawal from the competition in March 2005 after finding out the obligation to broadcast all participating entries, including the Israeli one, as well as enabling their viewers to vote for them; this contravened a Lebanese law prohibiting any acknowledgement of Israel.

==Format==
===Visual design===
The official logo of the contest remained the same from the 2004 contest with the country&#x27;s flag in the heart being changed. Following Istanbul&#x27;s &#x27;Under the Same Sky&#x27;, the slogan for the 2005 show was &#x27;Awakening&#x27;, which symbolised the awakening of the country and city ready to present itself to Europe. The postcards (short clips shown between performances) for the 2005 show illustrated Ukraine&#x27;s culture and heritage along with a more modern and industrial side to the country.

This was the first edition to be broadcast in widescreen 16:9 format.

==Official album==

Eurovision Song Contest: Kyiv 2005 was the official compilation album of the 2005 contest, put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by EMI Records and CMC International on 2 May 2005. The album featured all 39 songs that entered in the 2005 contest, including the semi-finalists that failed to qualify into the grand final.

The original cover designed for the album was changed after &#x27;s withdrawal from the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 after announcing they would show advertisements over the Israeli entry. Had they entered, they would have been on track 4, disc 2 with the song &quot;Quand tout s&#x27;enfuit&quot; by Aline Lahoud.

It was reported that sales of the 2005 Eurovision merchandise reached record-breaking levels.

<text>Jiāng Kuí () (c. 1155 Poyang – c. 1221 Hangzhou), courtesy name Yaozhang (), Art name Baishi Daoren (). Also known as &quot;Jiang Baishi&quot; () was a famous Chinese poet, composer, poetry theorist and calligrapher of the Song dynasty, particularly famed for his &quot;ci&quot; (song lyric poetry). He composed numerous poems, including the famous &quot;He Bei Lai&quot; and the more well known &quot;San Wan Yue.&quot;

== Life ==
Jiang was born in Poyang (in today&#x27;s Jiangxi province). His family was of mediocre social status and Kui himself did not obtain any post in the government throughout his life. His father was a county magistrate during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Song.

Jiang made multiple attempts on the imperial exam but was not able to pass them. He traveled extensively between the regions of Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and Fujian. He had close contacts with his contemporary poets and literati. Jiang Kui moved to Huzhou from Poyang before finally settling down in Hangzhou where he died.

== Poetry ==
Jiang&#x27;s poetic style is notably influenced by Zhou Bangyan but his own style was distinct from other poets. In his early years as an abecedarian of poetry, his mentor was Xiao Ju (蕭𣂏). According to his own biography, Jiang values the originality of his poems more than the following of established poetic theories from the past. In the eyes of 13th century artist and art theorist Chen Yu, the poetry of Jiang Kui is marked by his candidness(as a lack of overly ink-horn words) and originality. Chen noted that Jiang&#x27;s poetry was not influenced by his contemporaries. As a result, Jiang was able to establish his own school at the time and influence other poets that admired his works.

Another 13th-century Ci poet Zhang Yan () described Jiang&#x27;s poetic style as &quot;Clouds that leave or stay without a trace&quot;, underlining the unpredictability of Jiang&#x27;s poems.

== Musicology ==
Aside from being a poet, Jiang was also a musicologist of classical Chinese musics. He was best known for his lyric poems. Jiang tried to restore the lost tunes of ancient times but was scoffed by the officials of Taichang Si (Office of Great constancy, a government department of ancient China in charge of ritualistic affairs as well as classical musics).

<doc id="657205" wikidata="Q4283152" url="?curid=657205" title="John Rocker">
<text>John Loy Rocker (born October 17, 1974) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher who played six seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily with the Atlanta Braves. Rocker made his major league debut in 1998 with the Braves, where he spent four seasons and was later a member of the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He last played professionally for the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in 2005.

Rocker received notoriety during his career for making controversial statements, which began with a 1999 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; interview and continued after his retirement. Following the conclusion of his baseball career, Rocker competed on &quot;&quot; with girlfriend Julie McGee, placing 16th.

==Baseball career==
In high school, Rocker was a pitcher for First Presbyterian Day School in Macon, Georgia. He threw three no-hitters during his high-school career. He initially committed to play college baseball for the Georgia Bulldogs. The Atlanta Braves selected Rocker in the 18th round (516th overall) of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft.

In 1998, the Braves promoted Rocker to the major leagues. In his first season in the major leagues, he was 1–3 with a 2.13 ERA in 38 innings pitched. The following year, an injury put Atlanta closer Kerry Ligtenberg on the disabled list, moving Rocker into the role of closer, where he was 4–5 with 38 saves and a 2.49 ERA. In 2000, he was 1–2 with 24 saves, posting a 2.89 ERA but in June 2000, Rocker was demoted after threatening a reporter.

Rocker started to receive intense taunting from opposing teams&#x27; fans due to his negative behavior and his pitching performance began to decline. On June 22, 2001, Rocker, along with minor-league infielder Troy Cameron (Atlanta&#x27;s first-round draft pick in 1997), was traded to the Cleveland Indians for right-handed relievers Steve Karsay and Steve Reed along with cash. In Cleveland, his record that year was 3–7 with a 5.45 ERA and four saves. Rocker pitched in the ALDS against the Seattle Mariners. After the season, the Indians traded him to the Texas Rangers for pitcher David Elder. In Texas, he refused designation to the minor leagues. In 2002, he again struggled at 2–3 with a 6.66 ERA and was released. In 2003, Rocker signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays but was released after two appearances and an ERA of 9.00.

Rocker took the 2004 season off to recover from surgery on his left shoulder. In 2005, he signed with the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League. In April 2005, he asked New Yorkers to &quot;bury the hatchet.&quot; After going 0–2 with a 6.50 ERA in 23 games, he was released on June 27, 2005.

==Controversies==
===Controversial statements===
In a story published in the December 27, 1999, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Rocker made a number of allegations stemming from his experiences in New York City and answering a question about whether he would ever play for the New York Yankees or the New York Mets:
During the interview, he also spoke of his opinion of the New York Mets and their fans:

The interview was conducted while driving to a speaking engagement in Atlanta. The reporter, Jeff Pearlman, wrote that during the interview session, Rocker spat on a Georgia State Route 400 toll machine and mocked Asian women. Also, Rocker referred to Curaçaoan teammate Randall Simon as a &quot;fat monkey&quot;.

Although Rocker later apologized after speaking with Braves legend and Hall of Famer Hank Aaron and former Atlanta mayor and congressman Andrew Young, he continued to make controversial remarks. For his comments, Commissioner Bud Selig suspended Rocker without pay for the remainder of spring training and the first 28 games of the 2000 season, which on appeal was reduced to 14 games (without a spring-training suspension).

In 2002, while with the Rangers, Rocker again made national headlines for his views after directing slurs towards patrons of a Dallas restaurant at which he was dining, located in the predominantly gay neighborhood of Oak Lawn.

In June 2006, Rocker defended former teammate Ozzie Guillén, at the time the manager of the Chicago White Sox, for referring to &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; sports columnist Jay Mariotti as a &quot;fag&quot;. Guillen, a native of Venezuela, claimed it was not a derogatory term and that, in Venezuela, the term only questions another man&#x27;s courage rather than his sexual orientation.

&quot;This is a free country. If he wants to use a lewd term, he should be able to use a lewd term,&quot; Rocker told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. &quot;Can&#x27;t you use a lewd term in America if you want?&quot; Referring to sensitivity training, he was quoted as saying: &quot;It was a farce, a way for the scared little man, Bud Selig, to get people off his ass.&quot; Rocker stated that when he attended mandatory sensitivity training he would seldom remain longer than 15 minutes. He also claimed he never paid the $500 fine that was levied against him.

In late 2006, Rocker was interviewed by the sports blog Deadspin, along with fitness model and then-girlfriend Alicia Marie. In the interview, Rocker discussed his &quot;Speak English&quot; campaign, as well as his upcoming book, &quot;Rocker: Scars &amp; Strikes&quot;. Rocker stated that the book would not be used to try to repair his reputation, but would rather be &quot;more conservative Republican rantings&quot;. Also during the interview, Rocker lambasted John Schuerholz, his former general manager with the Braves, calling him &quot;a piece of shit&quot;.

On &quot;Survivor&quot;, during an argument with fellow castmate Natalie Anderson, Rocker told her, &quot;If you were a man, I&#x27;d knock your teeth out.&quot;

===Steroid use===
In March 2007, Rocker was implicated in a steroid ring that included Applied Pharmacy of Mobile, Alabama. Rocker initially denied the reports that he had used somatropin but a spokesperson later claimed that Rocker had been prescribed human growth hormone following a shoulder surgery. In December 2011, he admitted to using steroids, saying &quot;Yeah, of course I was [using steroids]. I mean who wasn&#x27;t? Let’s be honest here, who wasn&#x27;t?&quot;

==Movie and television appearances==
The comments made by Rocker about New York City would be lampooned by the MTV animated series &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; in their episode &quot;&quot;Celebrity Deathmatch:&quot; North vs. South&quot;; befitting the theme, his opponent was New York Yankees icon Derek Jeter, though he would not portray himself in the episode, being impersonated by a worker on the show, Sean Lynch. 

Rocker made his screen-acting debut in the 2002 horror comedy &quot;The Greenskeeper&quot; as a murderous golf-club groundskeeper.

In 2006, Rocker appeared on the Spike TV network&#x27;s &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;, a program that pits retired professional athletes against amateurs.

In August 2014 it was announced that Rocker would appear on the of the competitive reality series &quot;Survivor&quot; alongside his girlfriend Julie McGee. He was the third person voted out, finishing in 16th place after he became the center of negative attention. He was immediately recognized by some of the other players who were aware of his controversial statements. He was voted out of the game with an immunity idol in his pocket on Day 8. McGee made it to the merge phase of the game, but quit in 12th place after suffering an emotional breakdown, citing the negativity surrounding Rocker earlier in the game as one of the multiple reasons that she decided to withdraw from the competition.

Though not directly based on Rocker, Danny McBride said that Kenny Powers, the main protagonist of the HBO series &quot;Eastbound and Down&quot; that the pitcher was &quot;more or less an inspiration&quot; for the character.

==Other media activity==
In December 2011, Rocker released his autobiography, &quot;Scars and Strikes&quot;. As of 2012, he writes a column for WorldNetDaily, a conservative political site.

<doc id="657210" wikidata="Q1138174" url="?curid=657210" title="Cowboy Junkies">
<text>Cowboy Junkies are an alternative country and folk rock band formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1985 by Alan Anton (bassist), Michael Timmins (songwriter, guitarist), Peter Timmins (drummer) and Margo Timmins (vocalist). The three Timminses are siblings, and Anton worked with Michael Timmins during their first couple of bands. John Timmins was a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their debut studio album. The band line-up has never changed since, although they use several guest musicians on many of their studio albums, including multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird who has performed on every album except the first.

Cowboy Junkies&#x27; 1986 debut studio album, produced by Canadian producer Peter Moore, was the blues-inspired &quot;Whites Off Earth Now!!&quot;, recorded in the family garage using a single ambisonic microphone.

The band gained wide recognition with their second studio album, &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; (1988), recorded in 1987 at Toronto&#x27;s Church of the Holy Trinity. Their sound, again with Peter Moore using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of blues, country, folk, rock and jazz earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988. 

Cowboy Junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums, with tour dates booked into 2025.

==History==
=== Early history===
Alan Anton and Michael Timmins, lifelong friends who met in kindergarten, formed their first band in high school. In 1979, influenced by post-punk bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, they recruited drummer Geoff Railton and vocalist Liza Dawson-Whisker, and formed Hunger Project in Toronto. They moved to Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side and performed at a variety of clubs. In early 1981, the Hunger Project embarked on a multi-city tour of the United States. After that, Hunger Project moved to the United Kingdom, where they toured for three months and released the single &quot;The Same Inside/Assembly&quot; on their independent label, Latent Recordings.

When Hunger Project disbanded, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins remained in London and started an improvisational band named Germinal. The members – Michael Timmins on guitar, Alan Anton on bass, a drummer, and saxophonist, played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time. Germinal released two studio albums: &quot;Germinal 1&quot; (1983) and &quot;Din&quot; (1984). The music newspaper New Musical Express said Germinal &quot;ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year.&quot; Alan Anton and Michael Timmins had a somewhat different take, saying, &quot;It was the ultimate release for us. But for the audience, it was quite a chore.&quot; In London, they developed journeyman skills as musicians, and expanded their knowledge of music history — Michael Timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with Germinal. Among those who were to influence Michael Timmins and Alan Anton were jazz musicians Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, along with the sound of early blues musicians Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, Bukka White, and Robert Johnson. Germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984. Alan Anton moved to Berlin and Michael Timmins returned to New York City.

Upon their return to Toronto in 1985, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins rented a house, insulated the tiny garage, and, with younger brother Pete Timmins sitting in on drums, began exploring a new musical direction. Margo was drafted to join and recalls, &quot;I was contemplating going on to graduate school, staying in school. That was safe. I never wanted to be a musician or be onstage.&quot; Nevertheless, Michael Timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams, realizing that a female voice was what the band needed. Michael Timmins said, &quot;I thought if you had this female voice on top of it, you could do anything you wanted.&quot;

However, the slow musical tempos and whispery, hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration, but came about by necessity. Their recording studio was their repurposed garage, which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours. On their first jam session, the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbour. According to Michael Timmins, &quot;We realized we had to tone down. One thing fed into the other: Margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet. We began to realize, if we can get down underneath Margo, the sound will be more effective. Pete picked up brushes – he was just learning to play drums at that point. Everything sort of came down. We learned to play with less volume.&quot;

When the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig, the members considered various names before choosing Cowboy Junkies. During their early gigs the band would perform at The Rivoli which had a small space in the back. The group would perform a rhythmic groove while Margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs. Many times the Junkies entire performance would be a single jam session.

Peter Moore, a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer, was at their first show. According to Moore, &quot;I was mesmerized by Margo. The very first show, people weren&#x27;t paying attention to them, because they were playing so softly and quietly. Margo had her back to the audience a lot of the time.&quot;

=== 1980s ===
When the Cowboy Junkies were ready to record a studio album the band sought a like-minded recording engineer. They met Peter Moore at a dinner party, and when they began talking about recording equipment and techniques, they found that Moore&#x27;s interest in single-microphone recording meshed with their desire to capture the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage. Moore had just purchased a Calrec Ambisonic microphone at the wholesale price of $9,000. The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the rehearsal space on June 26, 1986, and turned the garage into a recording studio. Moore arranged the group around his Calrec, jury-rigged a control room in the kitchen, and started recording.

The Cowboy Junkies shopped their material but were unable to find a label to distribute their work, so they revived the indie label Latent Recordings that Michael Timmins and Anton had used for their Hunger Project and Germinal works, and released &quot;Whites Off Earth Now!!&quot; in October 1986. They sold 3,000 copies. The band then toured the US. Michael Timmins described the experience: &quot;While touring &quot;Whites&quot; we had spent a lot of time in the Southern states, especially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. For some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old Confederacy. Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town, so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters, fans, waitresses and bartenders.&quot;

The band&#x27;s next project, &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; (1988), became their breakthrough. Peter Moore again produced the album. They approached the project as a reaction against the MIDI–dominated musical styles of the &#x27;80s. Moore said, &quot;I was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and MIDI. No humanity, no nothing. I&#x27;m listening to these recordings from the &#x27;50s with two or three mics and I&#x27;m going, &#x27;Man that&#x27;s real music.&#x27;&quot; He chose the Church of the Holy Trinity in Toronto for its natural reverb. To better persuade the officials of the historic church, Moore claimed &quot;The Timmins Family Singers&quot; were recording a Christmas special. The session began early on November 27, 1987. Songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first, and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements. In this way Moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one. To better balance Margo&#x27;s vocals against the electric guitars and drums, she was recorded through a PA system left behind by a previous group. By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours, Moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the album.

Music critic for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Anthony DeCurtis, summed up the result of the group&#x27;s efforts in a four-star review of the album: &quot;The Trinity Session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song. The mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective – an intense, melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic world-weariness of the Velvet Underground. [...] Having good songs, the skill to convey what they have to say and, most important, a vision, the Cowboy Junkies dispensed with high-tech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously. That attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiring.&quot;

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
The band&#x27;s third studio album was more challenging, requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired. Yet despite the problems with the making of it, the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that &quot;The Caution Horses&quot; (1990) remains one of their favourite albums. The band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of Toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their debut studio album was recorded in, instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; (1988). The session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired, particularly Margo Timmins who had a terrible head cold. After a few hours they realized the session wasn&#x27;t working out, and they left.

The second attempt was made on April 21 of 1987 when Peter Moore rented the Sharon Temple, an historic landmark located in the village of Sharon, Ontario. Michael Timmins recalls, &quot;The arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush, unlike the spareness of most of Trinity&#x27;s songs, that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didn&#x27;t just turn to mush on tape. Another problem was that the Temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined. As a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into Margo&#x27;s vocal mic and feedback.&quot; At the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezing, Michael Timmins states, &quot;When we packed up and left Sharon that day I don&#x27;t think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special. It had been a difficult three days and I think that we were all just happy that on that third day we had at least made some decent recordings of the songs if not necessarily memorable ones.&quot; Over the next several months the band were touring and playing songs on the Sharon tape. As the band listened, new ideas for them evolved. They also wrote additional songs. Although the band truly loved the recordings, the songs continued to develop on stage, and they believed the session no longer accurately represented where they were as a band. In 2022, however, they released the Sharon session as a special edition vinyl album as well as in streaming formats.

At the end of the tour, they decided to go into Eastern Studios in downtown Toronto and reinvent how they recorded themselves. &quot;The Caution Horses&quot; sessions went quickly and smoothly, and were recorded over several days in December 1989. Michael Timmins believes: &quot;The beauty of the recording and one of the reasons it remains one of our favourites is that it captures the essence of the band which magically fell together during the recording of The Trinity Session and which forged its own voice, under the glare of a very intense spotlight, in the clubs and concert halls of the world.&quot;

With their next studio album, &quot;Black Eyed Man&quot; (1992), Michael Timmins wanted to explore music structure, specifically time shifts and tempo shifts; while Margo Timmins wanted to expand her singing style and her range. Several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions, along with about twenty five other Toronto players that were known to the band, or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to include in the album. Realizing he needed a theme to hold the album together what Michael Timmins decided upon was &quot;love found, love lost and love betrayed - it was to be the journey of the faceless, nameless and haunted Black Eyed Man.&quot;

The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Pale Sun, Crescent Moon&quot; (1993) is a song cycle about male-female relationships. Margo Timmins describes the theme of the album as &quot;there is love and there is all that conspires to steal love away.&quot; Michael Timmins says, &quot;It is a very dense and complex work both lyrically and musically.&quot; Music critic, Mike Boehm, summed the album up this way: &quot;By the album&#x27;s end, Margo Timmins, the singer known for her preternatural hush, can be heard declaring herself with assertive bite: &#x27;It&#x27;s a (expletive) ole world, but this ole girl, well she ain&#x27;t giving in.&#x27; While it hasn&#x27;t exactly turned into a hard-rock band (the closely drawn, highly literate, mood-conscious internal monologue remains the signature of the band&#x27;s style), those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a desire to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by recording in an echoing church.&quot;

The Cowboy Junkies&#x27; sixth studio album, &quot;Lay It Down&quot; (1996), was one in which the group wanted to make the music outside of Toronto and away from usual routines, so they searched for a place that was a comfortable drive away from Toronto, but would feel remote. Alan Anton recalls, &quot;We found Rock Island, named not for music but for geology. It is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace. We went there for a week at a time and between chopping wood, cooking, boating, whittling, hiking and staring into the fire, worked up some songs that were as laid back and sparse as the setting.&quot; When the Junkies went to record the songs, they felt that their chosen songs would come together if they could &quot;find a studio which would approximate the vibe of Rock Island in the sense of a relaxed but focused mood and its remoteness from the music industry mainland.&quot; They found a big-porched southern house in Athens, Georgia that fit their needs. The Junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of Athens in June 1995. The producer and engineer John Keane had built a homey but state-of-the-art studio, and the band settled in quickly.

The Cowboy Junkies&#x27; last studio album of the decade is an alternative country album, &quot;Miles from Our Home&quot; (1998). Wanting to repeat the process of writing and creating used for &quot;Lay It Down&quot;, Michael Timmins found a house near a gristmill on a pond, a couple hours drive from Toronto, where he spent six months writing songs. During that time, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down to work on songs. Then Michael wrote more, until the songs were worked out and ready to record. On New Year&#x27;s Day in 1997, just as Timmins was planning the album, the band heard that Townes Van Zandt had died. Van Zandt was a friend of the band, had toured with them in their bus in 1990, and was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael. On the day that Michael Timmins had heard that Van Zandt had died he wrote the first draft of &quot;Blue Guitar&quot;, &quot;as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard.&quot;

=== 2000s ===
Throughout their career, Cowboy Junkies have approached each studio album to see where they can change or improve. &quot;Open&quot;, which was released on May 15, 2001, follows in that tradition. While they were on a tour to support their live album &quot;Waltz Across America&quot;, which lasted nine months and had many breaks in the schedule, they began working on new material. They added two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing the songs to evolve on stage. During breaks, they would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith&#x27;s studio, Chemical Sound, to live record material they had created. Being able to set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day was a departure from their habit of trying to complete an album&#x27;s worth of songs in a set recording period. On each visit, they would record two or three songs. They also took the opportunity to re-record songs. After the band had recorded fifteen tracks, they listened and decided they had the songs they needed, with two additional songs recorded at Peter Moore&#x27;s home studio.

&quot;One Soul Now&quot; (2004) was recorded over the course of a year, from October 2002 to October 2003. Its central idea is that everyone is interconnected. When the band returned home after their Open Tour, they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed The Clubhouse. This new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process.

The Cowboy Junkies next project was &quot;Early 21st Century Blues&quot;, which was recorded February through March 2005, and released in August of that year. It was begun a few months after their previous tour. The theme for the album was war, violence, fear, greed, ignorance, or loss, and everybody had to bring two or three songs written by other people. This album was unique in that John Timmins recorded with his siblings, playing guitar.

&quot;At the End of Paths Taken&quot; was released on April 9, 2007. Michael Timmins wrote songs that &quot;reflect the complex, frustrating, edifying, and conflict-ridden web of relationships that constitute the family, from nuclear to extended to global. He is a parent, and a son with aging parents. He plays with his siblings in the Cowboy Junkies.&quot; Timmins blends his alternative country music sound with ferocious guitar work on &quot;My Little Basquiat&quot; and &quot;Mountain&quot;. At times Timmins sounds as if he has lost control of his guitar playing, &quot;until you realize there&#x27;s not a stray note to be found. . . . Timmons&#x27; [sic] guitar playing has grown more aggressive over the years.&quot;

For the twentieth anniversary of their breakthrough studio album, &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; (1988), the Cowboy Junkies reinterpreted the album to highlight what twenty years of performing experience brought to the songs. In order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting, the Cowboy Junkies invited three guest musicians whose work has affected the Cowboy Junkies, and whose work and lives were affected by the album. Guest musicians on the 2007 album include Natalie Merchant, Vic Chesnutt, and Ryan Adams. Each does lead vocal on one of the album&#x27;s songs (Merchant on &quot;To Love Is to Bury&quot;, Chesnutt on &quot;Postcard Blues&quot;, and Adams on &quot;200 More Miles&quot;). They also perform on other tracks. Jeff Bird, a session musician who has appeared on virtually every Cowboy Junkies album, is also included in the project. In order to create the same atmosphere, they kept rehearsal to a minimum, getting together for a few hours a day before the recording. The guest musicians worked with the band to re-imagine the songs, making suggestions, trying out fresh nuances. The album contains a performance film, &quot;Trinity Revisited&quot;, and a documentary film, &quot;Trinity Session Revisited&quot;. Directors Pierre and François Lamoureux, produced and recorded the album and the films. Although the album was not recorded with a single microphone like the original album, the directors placed the musicians in a circle and used a surround microphone, augmented the recording with ten close-mics to record them.

=== 2010s ===
&quot;The Nomad Series&quot; (2017) is a set of four studio albums that was released over three years from 2010 to 2012. &quot;The Nomad Series&quot; is not based on a particular theme regarding music, but are based on a set of paintings by their friend, artist Enrique Martinez Celaya. The group found the name appropriate, since they have been touring for over 30 years. The Junkies had no recording contract when they created &quot;the Nomad Series&quot;, which freed them up to be experimental with their music, to avoid categorizing the planned releases.

The first album in the series is &quot;Renmin Park&quot; (2010), which is based on ideas the band&#x27;s principal songwriter, Michael Timmins, got while living in China for three months with his wife and three children. Two of his children were adopted from China, and during their stay they visited the birth village of his adopted daughters. Most of their time was spent in Jingjiang, situated on the Yangtze River about two hours&#x27; drive from Shanghai. The music that inspired Timmins most during the visit was found at Renmin Park, where a variety of musicians would gather throughout the day, bringing their erhus, pipas, shangxians, various percussion instruments; and a mix of singers performed. Timmins found most of the musicians outstanding, he thought the singers were good because they all performed with passion. About halfway through the visit, Timmins was introduced to Eric Chen, who was passionate about music, and became Timmins&#x27; friend. Chen brought Timmins a variety of CDs and videos that showcased the Chinese rock scene.

Michael asked his brother, Peter Timmins, to send him a high-end portable recorder, which he carried everywhere he went, and recorded music, conversations, exercise classes, badminton games, traffic, students chatter in classrooms, street hawkers, and more. He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds, and to use his imagination. The core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart. &quot;Renmin Park&quot; is also a thank-you letter to the people of the city that so kindly welcomed him and his family.

On December 25, 2009, at the age of 45, Cowboy Junkies friend, Vic Chesnutt, died from an overdose of muscle relaxants. Chesnutt was generally a friendly and cheerful man, but he sometimes suffered bouts of severe depression. &quot;Demons&quot;, released January 18, 2011, is the Cowboy Junkies tribute to him. The band had included him in their twentieth anniversary celebration of &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; when they made &quot;Trinity Revisited&quot; (2007). Chesnutt sang lead vocals on the song, &quot;Postcard Blues.&quot; He had also toured with the group several times, starting with the tour supporting &quot;Lay It Down&quot; (1996). Michael Timmins stated, &quot;One of the hopes of this album is that it inspires people to seek out the originals and keep his music alive. We had intended to do an album where he would write the songs, and we would be the band. Now we&#x27;re trying to fulfil a bit of that desire.&quot; The Cowboy Junkies managed to turn an album born from grief into an assertion of life.

On October 14, 2011, music critic Jason Lent began his review of &quot;Sing in My Meadow&quot; with this observation, &quot;When R.E.M. called it quits, the band talked about walking away having maintained their artistic integrity throughout a 30-year career. As Cowboy Junkies pass the quarter century mark, the Toronto band must rest well at night. The band&#x27;s consistent work flies under the radar more times than not and the band sounds content with keeping it that way.&quot; He continues, &quot;One of the band&#x27;s live staples in recent years is &quot;Hunted&quot; from 1994&#x27;s &quot;Pale Sun Crescent Moon&quot;. Revisiting the song here, the original sounds frail and timid in comparison. Margo belts out the lyrics with the dry bitterness of someone who has witnessed first-hand the arrows that fly between men and women. As the band shakes the rafters, Bird delivers a mandolin solo that redefines the possibilities of the instrument.&quot;

&quot;The Wilderness&quot; was released on March 27, 2012, and is the fourth and final entry of &quot;The Nomad Series&quot;. The album reflects the introspective nature of winter. The album is a return to the folk vibe the band played with in the late 80s and early 90s. Songwriter Michael Timmins states: &quot;I started to think in terms of an album of songs reflecting on the lives of characters I&#x27;d written about early in the bands career and bringing those characters . . . into the future to see where their lives were at now.&quot; About his lyrics, Timmins says: &quot;Some of those songs have little touch points where . . . you can see how they connect to earlier songs -- even character&#x27;s names and stuff pops into them, and that&#x27;s intentional.&quot; The style of the songs on the album comes closer to the typical Cowboy Junkies music, more than the other albums in &quot;The Nomad series&quot;.

The Cowboy Junkies studio album, &quot;All That Reckoning&quot;, was released on July 13, 2018. In an interview about the upcoming album with &quot;Billboard&quot;, guitarist and songwriter Michael Timmins said, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of pressures and a lot of crumbling of institutions, very little foundation to put one&#x27;s feet on again, especially at an older age. You sort of expect things to be there and realize, &#x27;My God, what I thought was a standard, whether it be an institution or a way of dealing with people in our society, is disappearing.&quot; In 2019, they joined the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.

=== 2020s ===
The Cowboy Junkies&#x27; eighteenth studio album, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, was released digitally on March 30, 2020. 

The band contributed a cover version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s 2020 song &quot;I&#x27;ve Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You&quot; to the &quot;Dylan Revisited&quot; compilation album in 2021. &quot;Variety&quot; ranked it the 17th best Dylan cover of all time the month after it premiered.

Their nineteenth studio album, a cover album, &quot;Songs of the Recollection&quot;, was released on March 25, 2022. &quot;Such Ferocious Beauty&quot; followed in 2023.

=== Concerts and television performances ===
Michael Timmins states that &quot;By the Spring of 1990 we had been on the road for close to two years straight, trying to stay right-side-up in the whirlwind of attention that was created by the release of &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; (1988) and the subsequent release of &quot;The Caution Horses&quot; (1990). We had accumulated, literally, trunks full of press clippings from around the world, but most importantly we had built up our confidence on stage. Margo was emerging as a true front-person and we were gelling as band. In May of that year we landed in the London for our first full fledge UK tour and were greeted with much adulation and interest. The tour was a tremendous success on all levels and thankfully the BBC was there to record one of the shows at The Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester.&quot;

The Cowboy Junkies have performed on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien, Later... with Jools Holland, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, at Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, when they were inducted in 2015, and many other venues. Among their recorded and commercially available concerts is the June 25, 2002 documentary &quot;Open Road&quot;, a four-hour DVD/CD documentary of performances from 2001. The DVD contains their Quebec City Summer Festival concert. In June 2007, they performed alongside the Boston Pops at Boston Symphony Hall conducted by Keith Lockhart. On January 1, 2017, Cowboy Junkies were part of CBC&#x27;s &quot;The Strombo Show&quot;&#x27;s Hip 30. Canadian bands covered songs from the Tragically Hip to commemorate the Hip&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Including the compilation albums &quot;Open Road&quot; and &quot;The Radio One Sessions&quot; (both 2002), the Junkies have published seven of their live performances.

<doc id="657216" wikidata="Q6470668" url="?curid=657216" title="Regions of Europe">
<text>Europe is often divided into regions and subregions based on geographical, cultural or historical factors. Since there is no universal agreement on Europe&#x27;s regional composition, the placement of individual countries may vary based on criteria being used. For instance, the Balkans is a distinct geographical region within Europe, but individual countries may alternatively be grouped into South-eastern Europe or Southern Europe.

Regional affiliation of countries may also evolve over time. Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries, but is now considered a part of Southern Europe. The exact placement of the Caucasus has also varied since classical antiquity and is now regarded by many as a distinct region within or partly in Europe. Greenland, and partially Iceland, is geographically a part of North America but has been politically and culturally influenced by Northern European countries for more than a millennium. As such, several regions are often included as belonging to a Greater Europe, including Anatolia, Cyprus, the South Caucasus, Siberia, Asian Kazakhstan (the part of Kazakhstan located east of European Kazakhstan), Greenland, as well as the overseas territories of EU member states.

== Subregions ==
Groupings by compass directions are the hardest to define in Europe, since there are a few calculations of the midpoint of Europe (among other issues), and the pure geographical criteria of &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; are often confused with the political meaning these words acquired during the Cold War era.

Some typical geographical subregions of Europe include:

* Central and Eastern Europe
** Central Europe
** Eastern Europe
* Northern Europe
** North-central Europe
** North-eastern Europe
** North-western Europe
* Southern Europe
** South-central Europe
** South-eastern Europe
** South-western Europe
* Western Europe

Note: There is no universally agreed definition for continental subregions. Depending on the source, some of the subregions, such as Central Europe or South-eastern Europe, can be listed as first-tier subregions. Some transregional countries, such as Romania or the United Kingdom, can be included in multiple subregions.

Common geopolitical subregions of Europe include:

Two Europes
* Old Europe and New Europe

Three Europes
* East-Central Europe
* Eastern Europe
* Western Europe

== Historical divisions ==
Europe can be divided along many differing historical lines, normally corresponding to those parts that were inside or outside a particular cultural phenomenon, empire or political division. The areas varied at different times, and so it is arguable as to which were part of some common historical entity (e.g., were Germany or Britain part of Roman Europe as they were only partly and relatively briefly part of the Empire—or were the countries of the former communist Yugoslavia part of the Eastern Bloc, since it was not in the Warsaw Pact).

* Greek East and Latin West: those parts that fell into the eastern (Byzantine) and Western Roman Empires.
* Catholic and Eastern Orthodoxy in Europe: those parts on either side of the Great Schism.
* After Reformation: countries of Western Christianity (Catholic and Protestant Churches) and Eastern Christianity (Eastern Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Oriental Orthodox churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches)
** Protestant and Catholic Europe: those parts that, in the main, left the Catholic Church during the Reformation contrasted with those that did not.
* Communist Europe (Eastern Bloc), Capitalist Europe (Western Bloc): those parts on either side of the Iron Curtain and third world countries (neutral and non-aligned during the Cold War).

<text>Nuno Gonçalves (c. 1425 – c. 1491, &quot;fl.&quot; 1450–71) was a Portuguese artist whose work initiated the Portuguese Renaissance in painting. He was court painter for Afonso V of Portugal from 1450 to 1471, and in 1471 he was appointed the official painter for the city of Lisbon. His surviving masterpiece is the polyptych known as the Saint Vincent Panels.

== Life ==
The details of his life are almost completely unknown. As a painter, Nuno Gonçalves was active between 1450 and 1472. In 1450 he was appointed court painter by King Afonso V and in recognition of his contributions, he was knighted by Afonso in 1470. In 1471, Gonçalves was appointed the official painter for Lisbon. There is no information regarding his birth, family, or education.

Although his history is obscure now, Gonçalves was recognized in his time as an important and talented artist. Francisco de Holanda, a 16th-century artist and art historian, called Gonçalves one of the foremost painters of his era. Today, the only work that can be assigned to him with any confidence is the polyptych, &quot;Saint Vincent Panels&quot;, originally presented to the Cathedral of Lisbon by Afonso V to commemorate his victories in Morocco. A few other works have been tentatively attributed to Gonçalves based on similarities of style; and others, such as the &quot;Flagellation of Christ&quot; have been referred to historically but are now lost. In addition to painting, he probably drew the scenes for the Pastrana Tapestries.

There is no record of where Gonçalves trained as a painter but art historians offer various possible influences on his work. His style represents a break from earlier Portuguese art. He has been compared to early Florentine fresco painters or possibly the Dutch artist Jan van Eyck who worked in Portugal around 1428.

He is depicted, among several other historic figures, on the Padrão dos Descobrimentos, a monument to the Portuguese Age of Discovery in Belém, Lisbon.

=== Saint Vincent Panels ===
The only reference that art historians can use to support his authorship of the Saint Vincent Panels is by Francisco de Holanda, in the 16th century. It mentions a great work of art made by him that is inferred to be the Panels. It is also speculated that the father of Hugo van der Goes collaborated in the painting of the panel but there is no concrete proof. Since their discovery in late 19th century there has been great dispute over the identity of the painter and the characters shown in the Panels. Even the claim that Prince Henry the Navigator appears in the third panel is still under debate. Nevertheless, the &quot;Saint Vincent Panels&quot; is seen as the highest peak of Portuguese antique art.

== List of works ==

These paintings are the most usually attributed to the painter:
*&quot;Saint Vincent Panels&quot;, c. 1470–1480, National Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon

<text>In geology, bedrock is solid rock that lies under loose material (regolith) within the crust of Earth or another terrestrial planet.

== Definition ==
Bedrock is the solid rock that underlies looser surface material. An exposed portion of bedrock is often called an outcrop. The various kinds of broken and weathered rock material, such as soil and subsoil, that may overlie the bedrock are known as regolith.

== Engineering geology ==
The surface of the bedrock beneath the soil cover (regolith) is also known as &quot;rockhead&quot; in engineering geology, and its identification by digging, drilling or geophysical methods is an important task in most civil engineering projects. Superficial deposits can be very thick, such that the bedrock lies hundreds of meters below the surface.

== Weathering of bedrock ==
Exposed bedrock experiences weathering, which may be physical or chemical, and which alters the structure of the rock to leave it susceptible to erosion. Bedrock may also experience subsurface weathering at its upper boundary, forming saprolite.

== Geologic map ==
A geologic map of an area will usually show the distribution of differing bedrock types, rock that would be exposed at the surface if all soil or other superficial deposits were removed. Where superficial deposits are so thick that the underlying bedrock cannot be reliably mapped, the superficial deposits will be mapped instead (for example, as alluvium).

<doc id="657235" wikidata="Q7159265" url="?curid=657235" title="Pedigree Chump">
<text>Pedigree Chump is the first album from the British ska punk band Spunge. It was released following the success of &quot;The Kicking Pigeons EP&quot; a year earlier which sold 5,000 copies to early followers at pub gigs.

The first 3,000 copies of the album included a five track bonus CD of live recordings. The standard album was re-released in December 2000 as a limited edition digipak without the bonus tracks. In 2004, the album was again re-released as a limited edition in a slipcase. The bonus tracks were bundled back onto this version, plus a rare demo of &quot;Make Me Happy&quot; and an enhanced video of &quot;Kicking Pigeons&quot;.

No singles were released from &quot;Pedigree Chump&quot;. However, the song &quot;Kicking Pigeons&quot; can be found on &quot;The Kicking Pigeons EP&quot; and an updated version of the same song is the second A-side on &quot;Live Another Day/Kicking Pigeons 2001&quot;, a single from their next album &quot;Room For Abuse&quot;.

<doc id="657252" wikidata="Q12417187" url="?curid=657252" title="Algoma Steel">
<text>Algoma Steel Inc. (formerly The Algoma Steel Corporation, Limited; Essar Steel Algoma) is an integrated primary steel producer located on the St. Marys River in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada. Algoma Steel was founded in 1901 by Francis Clergue, an American entrepreneur who had settled in Sault Ste. Marie. The company is a traditional blast furnace based steel maker that is building an electric arc furnace to produce steel with a lower carbon footprint.

Algoma Steel has been privately owned several times, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange at least three times; and has been a subsidiary or affiliate of Canadian Pacific Limited (1980s), Dofasco (1988-1991) and Essar Group (2007-2017). Reflecting the challenging environment for Canadian steel makers, Algoma and its predecessor companies have been financially restructured at least four times. Algoma first was in receivership following the Great Depression in 1932; while in recent decades it emerged from bankruptcy protection in 1992 and 2004, and was in creditor protection again in 2015-2018. 

In May 2021, it was announced that Algoma &quot;was to become a public company again&quot; as it had agreed a merger with New York–based acquisition firm Legato Merger Corp, which is a NASDAQ-listed special-purpose acquisition company. Following the deal, Algoma listed its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the third time.

==History==

The company was incorporated in 1901 and construction of the steelworks started in February of that year. On February 18, 1902, the first Bessemer converter was put in operation using pig iron made from the Helen mine, owned by Algoma. The first rails were produced by the complex in May 1902. However, blast furnaces for pig iron manufacture were not completed at the site until 1904. Unlike most other steel producers, Algoma had no access to local coal, forcing it to import coal and coke from the United States. The Bessemer process was felt to produce steel that was well-suited to manufacture of rails, which was the Algoma complex&#x27;s primary product for the first two decades of its existence.
Shortly after founding Algoma, Clergue&#x27;s various financial operations suffered reverses, having to shutter operations in 1903, causing the 1903 Consolidated Lake Superior riot. After restructuring, he lost control of the Sault Ste. Marie complex, being replaced as general manager in 1903 and by 1908 Clergue was no longer on the company&#x27;s board of directors. Initially, the company specialized in manufacture of rails for Canadian railways, but this soon became a dead-end as railway construction passed its peak.

During the First World War Algoma made steel for artillery shells but after the war continued to rely on rail production. The necessity of importing ore and coal from the United States due to the low quality of Canadian iron ore, as well as the absentee owners&#x27; greater interest in annual dividends than building a viable industrial complex, held back Algoma during the 1920s. At the height of the Great Depression, the company was insolvent and in receivership until financier Sir James Dunn, who had had a minority role in the mill&#x27;s ownwrship since 1908, gained control in 1935 and restored it to profitability. Dunn&#x27;s policy of never paying a dividend to stockholders, coupled with extensive modernization and expansion during the Second World War, and an extended period of steel demand up until the mid-1950s, allowed Algoma to expand and become a more balanced steel producer.

===Dofasco takeover and 1990-92 bankruptcy===
Algoma Steel was publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the 1980s when Dofasco bought the company from then controlling shareholder Canadian Pacific Limited. Canadian Pacific Ltd. owned 53.8% and they agreed to a total purchase price of CAD $560 million. At the time of the transaction, it was reported that Algoma had 9,000, largely unionized, employees. Dofasco owned Algoma from 1988 to 1991, making the combined company the largest steel producer in Canada. However, Dofasco wrote-off their equity investment less than three years later as Algoma entered a prolonged restructuring process. A strike at Algoma both reduced cash flows and increased costs, contributing to the financial stress of the company.

The high value of the Canadian dollar coupled with competition from mini mills, lower-cost and currency-strong Asian countries and dumping by Japanese companies has hurt Canadian primary steel producers. In 2002, the company emerged from bankruptcy protection for the second time in a decade, having previously gone into bankruptcy in 1990. Denis Turcotte, the President and CEO, was largely credited with Algoma&#x27;s resurgence, making it one of the most efficient steelmakers in North America.

Algoma Steel announced on August 3, 2005, that the company was no longer for sale after a $64.7 million second quarter profit. The company stated that they are going to focus on value-enhancing, non-sale alternatives. Algoma also announced a special dividend of $6.00 per share payable on August 31, 2005, to shareholders of record on August 17, 2005, and a normal course issuer bid for up to 3.3 million shares.

On February 8, 2006, Algoma Steel announced a $55 million profit for their fourth quarter ending December 31, 2005. As a result of this and redemption of their 11% notes on January 9, 2006 the company declared themselves debt free and had an operating surplus of over $400 million in cash. This cash surplus attracted the attention of some shareholders who wanted to see the cash distributed as dividends, echoing Algoma&#x27;s historic problems almost exactly a century earlier.

===Essar Global takeover and subsequent restructuring===
On 15 April 2007, India&#x27;s Essar Global made an offer to acquire Algoma Steel Inc. for $1.85 billion CAD in cash. It was announced on 20 June that Essar had completed its purchase of all outstanding shares.

On June 23, 2008, following its purchase by Essar Group, Algoma Steel Inc. announced that its name had been changed to Essar Steel Algoma Inc. This came along with a logo change to the Essar Steel company logo.

On May 26, 2017, Essar Steel Algoma was rebranded once again, simply called Algoma. The announcement was made in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. For legal purposes, the factory will remain &quot;Essar Steel Algoma Inc.&quot; until the company emerges from insolvency protection.
In May 2021 Algoma had a yearly production capacity of 2.8 million tonnes of steel, for which it employed around 2,700 people.

==Production and energy supply==
===Steel making facilities===
Algoma currently has a capacity of 4 million tons per year. Primary steel making facilities include two blast furnaces, three coke batteries, two 260 short ton basic oxygen furnaces, with two ladle metallurgy stations for refining and alloying. Having abandoned the manufacture of steel rails, Algoma employs a direct strip production complex manufactured by Danieli of Italy, which casts strip directly and then rolls it to finished strip in the range of 0.047 inches to 0.625 inches in thickness, and widths to 64 inches. Algoma also operates a hot strip mill, a plate mill, and a cold strip mill. Algoma also manufactures welded structural beams.

===Power generation and supply===
In October 2006, Algoma Steel was awarded a power purchase agreement by the Ontario Power Authority to build, own and operate a co-generation power plant utilizing by-product fuels such as blast furnace gas (BFG) and coke oven gas (COG); Algoma Steel has founded a limited partnership company called Algoma Energy LP to own and operate the co-generation facility. The facility&#x27;s contract capacity was said to be 63MW.

On June 15, 2009, Essar Steel Algoma successfully started up a new, 85 MW cogeneration facility, to produce electricity and steam from the by-products of the coke making and iron making processes.

It features two 375,000 lb/hr boilers and a 105MW turbine combined with other related components such as a generator, a blast furnace gas holder, condensate and feed-water systems, a water treatment plant, a cooling tower, a transformer, and a distributed control system. Essar has set a precedent as the first integrated steel manufacturer in Canada to construct a co-generation facility fueled with by-product gas from the operation.

==Current status==
Algoma currently is the second largest steel producer in Canada. It is the largest employer in Sault Ste. Marie and currently has 2800 employees at the main plant. Algoma now produces hot and cold rolled steel (i.e. sheet and plate).

Algoma&#x27;s products are used in the automotive, construction, energy, manufacturing, pipe and tube, and steel distribution industries.

<text>Faith Prince is an American actress and singer, best known for her work on Broadway in musical theatre. She won the Tony Award for Best Actress in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; in 1992, and received three other Tony nominations.

==Life and career==
Prince was born in Augusta, Georgia, and raised in Lynchburg, Virginia, where she attended E.C. Glass High School, and later studied theater at the University of Cincinnati – College-Conservatory of Music. She made her Broadway debut as the &quot;Gypsy&quot; character Tessie Tura in &quot;Jerome Robbins&#x27; Broadway&quot; (1989) and followed this with a role in the ill-fated &quot;Nick &amp; Nora&quot;.

She was established as a Broadway star with her portrayal of Miss Adelaide in the 1992 revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, for which she won both the Tony and Drama Desk Award as Best Actress in a Musical. In 2001, Prince was once again nominated for Tony and Drama Desk Awards for her portrayal of Ella Peterson in the revival of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;. She was featured in the 2008 Broadway musical &quot;A Catered Affair&quot;, for which she received Tony and Drama Desk nominations.

She appeared in a concert version of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; with the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra in Orlando, Florida in March 2009. On April 7, 2009, she took over the role of Ursula from Heidi Blickenstaff in the Broadway musical &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

She appeared in such films as &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; (1985), &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; (1997), and &quot;Our Very Own&quot; (2005), among others. Her television credits include the short-lived &quot;High Society&quot; (1995); recurring roles on &quot;Spin City&quot; (1997–2000) and &quot;Huff&quot; (2004–2005), as well as guest appearances on such shows as &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, and &quot;Happy Endings&quot;.

A live recording of her 2005 cabaret debut at Joe&#x27;s Pub, at The Public Theater, entitled &quot;A Leap of Faith&quot;, was released on the DRG Records label. A second recording, titled &quot;Total Faith&quot; was recorded at the Royal Room, Palm Beach, Florida. She participated in studio recordings of scores from &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; and Jerry Herman&#x27;s unproduced musical, &quot;Miss Spectacular&quot;.

She performs her cabaret act in various venues, such as the Orange County Performing Arts Center, California, in April 2010, and at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, Westchester County, New York, in May 2010. Prince appeared in the concert version (and accompanying recording) of the revue &quot;Life Begins at 8:40&quot; at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., on March 22, 2010. She also performed the closing show in the 2002–2003 theatre season at Eisenhower Hall at West Point.

Prince played Mrs. Wilkinson in the second United States national tour of &quot;Billy Elliot the Musical&quot;, which began performances in October 2010 and ended in August 2011. 

In 2012, Prince worked with long-term friend Jason Graae on &quot;The Prince and the Showboy&quot;, a show which pays tribute to composer Jerry Herman (&quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot;) whom Graae described as &quot;a survivor of the highest degree [who] lives his life as an eternal optimist.&quot; Prince and Graae won the New York Nightlife Award for outstanding musical comedy performer in January 2013.

She returned to the Broadway stage replacing Jane Lynch as Miss Hannigan in the revival of &quot;Annie&quot; beginning July 19, 2013. She then appeared as Shirley in the Broadway production of &quot;Disaster!&quot;

She had a recurring role in the ABC Family sitcom, &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot;, as Gloria Longo, and in the Fox musical drama &quot;Monarch&quot; as Nellie Cantrell.

<text>The Women&#x27;s International Zionist Organization (WIZO; &quot;&quot;) is a volunteer organization dedicated to social welfare in all sectors of Israeli society, the advancement of the status of women, and Jewish education in Israel and the Diaspora.

==History==

WIZO was founded in England on 7 July 1920 by Rebecca Sieff, Dr. Vera Weizmann (wife of Israel&#x27;s first president, Dr. Chaim Weizmann), Edith Eder, Romana Goodman, and Henrietta Irwell to provide community services for the residents of Mandatory Palestine. Among WIZO&#x27;s early social welfare projects in Mandatory Palestine were the establishment of Tipat Halav well-baby clinics and clothing distribution centers, many of which are still in operation today. WIZO opened the country&#x27;s first day care center in Tel Aviv in 1927.

WIZO branches opened across Europe, such as that run by Julia Batino in Macedonia, but many were closed down in the wake of Nazi occupation and the Holocaust. Branches in Latin America continued to operate during the war.

In 1949, after the establishment of the State of Israel, WIZO moved its headquarters to Israel and Sieff became president of the world WIZO organization. In 1966 Sieff died, she was replaced by Rosa Ginossar, who had been acting President since 1963. Other past presidents include Raya Jaglom and Michal Har&#x27;el, former Miss Israel and wife of Israeli politician Yitzhak Moda&#x27;i.

Presidents Evelyn Sommer (WIZO) and Ilana Ben Ami (WIZO Israel) tried to negotiate with Mexican president Luis Echeverría in 1975 to dissuade him from condemning Zionism as racism during the World Conference on Women in Mexico. Despite Echeverría&#x27;s promises, UN General Assembly, after the impulse of Arab countries and the support of the Non-Aligned Movement countries and the Soviet bloc, adopted Resolution 3379 against Zionism. Almost 20 years passed before the UN Resolution 46/86 revoked the 1975 determination.

In 2008, WIZO, together with two other women&#x27;s organizations, received the Israel Prize for its lifetime achievements and special contribution to society and the State of Israel.

==Political activity in Israel==
WIZO formed a party and ran for Knesset in Israel&#x27;s first elections in 1949, receiving 1.2% of the vote. It won one seat and was represented by Rachel Cohen-Kagan, chairwoman of WIZO at the time. Cohen-Kagan later ran in elections for the fifth Knesset as a member of the Liberal Party (though she was a member of the group that broke away to form the Independent Liberals).

==Today==
Today, WIZO runs 180 day care centers in Israel, caring for 14,000 children of working mothers, new immigrants and needy families. The organization also runs summer camps, courses for single-parent families and therapeutic frameworks for children removed from their homes by court order.

WIZO is now the largest women&#x27;s Zionist organization in the world. In 2008, 36 member countries sent delegates to Israel to celebrate the organization&#x27;s 88th birthday.

The current World WIZO president is Anat Vidor, who replaced Esther Mor in January 2024.

<doc id="657258" wikidata="Q3774964" url="?curid=657258" title="Saint Vincent Panels">
<text>The Saint Vincent Panels, or the &quot;Adoration of Saint Vincent&quot; panels, are a polyptych consisting of six panels that were perhaps painted in the 1450s. They are attributed to the Portuguese painter Nuno Gonçalves, who was active from 1450 to 1471. Traditionally, the polyptych is dated to the 1450s due to the putative prominence of Prince Henry the Navigator among the persons represented in the panels (Henry died in 1460). Controversy concerning the true nature of Henry&#x27;s presence in the panels – if any – along with the inclusion of figures that can be identified as his brothers, all of whom died before 1450, renders it difficult to assign any secure date for the creation of the panels other than sometime during the &quot;floruit&quot; of the painter Gonçalves.

The original retable, during its stay in the Cathedral of Lisbon, contained &quot;over twelve&quot; panels, as a source from 1767 states. They were displayed in the cathedral at least until 1690 and were set aside in the cathedral until 1742. They were then transferred to the palace of Mitra, where they escaped the devastating earthquake of Lisbon in 1755.

The panels are now housed in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (National Museum of Antique Art), in Lisbon, Portugal.

==Discovery==
Found during the late 1880s in the monastery of Saint Vicente de Fora in Lisbon, the panels depict scenes associated with the veneration of Saint Vincent of Saragossa. This polyptych consists of six separate panels of oak painted with oil or tempera.

The only reference that art historians can use to support the attribution of the creation of the panels to the painter Gonçalves was written in the 16th century by Francisco de Holanda. The reference mentions a great work of art made by him that is inferred to be these panels. There has also been speculation that the father of Hugo van der Goes collaborated in the painting of the panels, but no firm evidence to support this hypothesis exists. In any case, the &quot;Saint Vincent Panels&quot; are regarded as the greatest achievement of pre-modern Portuguese art.

==Interpretations ==

Since their discovery in the late 19th century, there has been a continuing dispute over the identity of the painter and the subjects portrayed on the panels. Some basic questions, still unanswered, are these:

* What scene, or scenes, are depicted in the panels?
* Who are the sixty persons portrayed?
* What symbolism is expressed in the panels?
* Who commissioned these panels to be painted?

The majority of experts who have studied this polyptych agree that the panels display several social groups of 15th-century Portugal. They also agree that the children of King John I are represented on these panels, but there is disagreement about their placement and identity. 
=== Panel of the Prince: alternative hypothesis ===

One of the more controversial issues concerning the panels is the depiction of Prince Henry the Navigator. At first glance, the appearance of the man in black in the third panel is quite compatible with traditional conceptions of Prince Henry&#x27;s likeness: a man with a light moustache and distinctive black round chaperon such as can be found in numerous representations today. However, there are strong reasons to doubt that this is him.
The most basic problem in identifying the man-in-the-chaperon in the Saint Vincent Panels derives from the lack of confirmed portraits of Prince Henry that date from his lifetime. The only other 15th-century image of the man-in-the-chaperon is found in the frontispiece of a copy (currently held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France) of Gomes Eanes de Zurara&#x27;s &quot;Crónicas dos Feitos de Guiné&quot;, written in 1453. Zurara&#x27;s book is an account of the early Portuguese discoveries in Africa along with a hagiography of Prince Henry, to whom the author assigned singular credit for the discoveries. As a result, it has been assumed that the frontispiece depicts Henry, especially since the motto underneath it seems to have been Henry&#x27;s own.
One alternative hypothesis postulates that the man-in-the-chaperon in Zurara&#x27;s book might actually be King Edward of Portugal (r. 1431-38), Prince Henry&#x27;s brother. It has been pointed out that critical phases of the discoveries were launched during his reign, and it would not be unusual for a portrait of a king to adorn a chronicle of events that occurred during his reign.

This alternative hypothesis can be used to help clarify the identity of the figures surrounding St. Vincent in the Panel of the Prince. Specifically, it offers an explanation for the symmetrical arrangement of men and women as pairings of kings and queens. In this interpretation, the standing pair would be King Edward (in a black chaperon), standing at the right and balanced on the left by his wife, Queen Eleanor of Aragon. Below them would be their son, King Afonso V of Portugal, kneeling on the right and facing his consort, Queen Isabella of Coimbra, who is kneeling on the left. The boy in the panel would then be Edward&#x27;s heir, the future King John II of Portugal.

This alternative hypothesis seems more logical than the original hypothesis that insists on identifying the man-in-the-chaperon as Prince Henry. Since Henry was a bachelor, it is not obvious what woman would be suitable to pair with him as the standing figure on the left. His closest female relatives were his mother Philippa and sister, Isabella, Duchess of Burgundy, both of whom would be more properly paired with their husbands. Moreover, Isabella did not live in Portugal after 1430, thus her lack of involvement with Portuguese society at the time the panel was painted would probably disqualify her from inclusion. If the uncle of a king were to be incorporated in the panel, it would more properly be Peter, Duke of Coimbra, who was once the regent of Afonso V and the father of his bride.

Another interpretation of the figures includes Henry in the panel, but proposes Edward as the kneeling king and Afonso V as the boy. Regardless, all traditional means of explaining Henry&#x27;s presence in the panel strike one as forced, formulated simply to accommodate a preconceived notion that Henry must be the man-in-the-chaperon. Since Edward was the brother of Henry, it is perfectly possible that he bore a close enough resemblance to Henry that the traditional identification in the Zurara book is perfectly correct, and that Edward&#x27;s appearance in the panel is only coincidentally similar to what is depicted for Henry in the Zurara book.

The alternative hypothesis with King Edward as the man-in-the-chaperon is more logical; pairs of kings and queens are all that are featured in the panel, with no intrusion from other family members, except for the minor son of one of the royal pairs. Other relatives are featured in a panel of their own (see below). In consideration of this, the Panel of the Prince perhaps ought to be called the Panel of Kings instead, with the king intended to be featured most prominently apparently Afonso V, who was the reigning king of Portugal throughout the &quot;floruit&quot; of Nuno Gonçalves, thus the most likely candidate as patron for the preparation of the panels.

=== Panel of the Knights: alternative hypothesis ===

Hypotheses that assert Henry the Navigator is not the man-in-the-chaperon identify him in another panel: the fifth panel known as the &quot;Panel of the Knights&quot;. This alternative interpretation posits that the four knights featured in the panel are the four younger brothers of King Edward of Portugal, as follows:
* On the right is Peter, Duke of Coimbra, who was prince regent during the minority of Afonso V; he is wearing a belt of the Order of the Garter. 
* On the left is John of Reguengos, Constable of Portugal, in the red color and blade-holding pose typical of the Order of Saint James of the Sword, of which he was the master.
* On top, helmeted and bearded in black, is Ferdinand the Holy Prince, who died after spending many years as a hostage in a Moroccan prison. His beard, long hair and emaciated face may reflect his long captivity. It is possible that the reflection on his helmet is intended to represent the end of a Moorish prison window or (in conjunction with his beard), a Cross fleury, the badge of the Order of Aviz, of which he was the master.
* Below, kneeling in purple, is Prince Henry the Navigator, master of the Order of Christ, with what seems like that order&#x27;s cross pendant on his neck and a loose belt of the Order of the Garter. The face of this grey-haired Henry is very different from traditional portrayals.

There has also been much discussion around the possible political significances of this panel. It seems, in particular, that by the poses, this panel aims to humiliate Henry the Navigator, possibly for allying himself with Afonso of Braganza against his full brother Peter, Duke of Coimbra, in the Battle of Alfarrobeira in 1449. These features of the portrait have been noted: 
* Henry is on his knees, seemingly begging for forgiveness, while Peter and John seem to &quot;stand guard&quot; over him. 
* The pendant Order of Christ cross around Henry&#x27;s neck is broken.
* Henry&#x27;s garter belt is untied and disheveled, whereas Peter&#x27;s is worn properly. 
* The pommel of Henry&#x27;s sword is twisted, dull and draped in black thread, whereas Peter and John&#x27;s swords are shiny, laced with gold and silver threads.
* Henry&#x27;s head is penitently uncovered, whereas Peter and John wear the caps of nobles.
* Peter and John are wearing white gloves, perhaps to denote guilt-free &quot;clean hands&quot;, whereas Henry is ungloved.
* Henry seems to gaze straight across to another panel, as if he were asking forgiveness from the royal dynasty he had &quot;wronged&quot;, whereas Peter and John look at the spectators.

It is worth remarking that the colors chosen for the princes seem to match the liturgical colors of the Roman rite—black (Ferdinand) for mourning of the dead, green (Peter) for ordinary, red (John) for passion and sacrifice and purple (Henry) for penance and mortification.

If this interpretation is valid, then the polyptych of St. Vincent may very well have been conceived by Nuno Gonçalves as a piece of anti-Braganza political propaganda, one possible reason it might have remained hidden for years. It would also set up a &quot;terminus post quem&quot; for the creation of the panels; they would have to have been painted after 1449 (the date of the Battle of Alfarrobeira). That would tend to support the traditional belief that they date from the 1450s (when passions left over from that conflict would still have been fresh), however if the boy depicted in the Panel of the Prince can be identified as the future King John II (b. 1455), his height and appearance would certainly indicate a child older than five years&#x27; old, thus a date in the 1460s would be more likely.

<text>Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication used to treat and prevent a number of types of cardiac dysrhythmias. This includes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and wide complex tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Evidence in cardiac arrest, however, is poor. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin.
Common side effects include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As amiodarone can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding it can cause problems in the fetus or the infant. It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication. It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again.
Amiodarone was first made in 1961 and came into medical use in 1962 for chest pain believed to be related to the heart. It was pulled from the market in 1967 due to side effects. In 1974 it was found to be useful for arrhythmias and reintroduced. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 237th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Amiodarone has been used both in the treatment of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the long-term suppression of arrhythmias. Amiodarone is commonly used to treat different types of abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial arrhythmias (supraventricular arrhythmias) and ventricular arrhythmias.

Atrial arrhythmias and supraventricular arrhythmias are terms often used interchangeably to refer to abnormal heart rhythms originating from the upper chambers of the heart, known as the atria. These types of arrhythmias include conditions such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. They are collectively referred to as supraventricular or atrial arrhythmias because they occur above (supra) the ventricles in the electrical conduction system of the heart.

Ventricular arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that originate in the ventricles, which are the lower chambers of the heart. These arrhythmias can be potentially life-threatening and may disrupt the heart&#x27;s ability to pump blood effectively.

Amiodarone can be effective in treating conditions like ventricular fibrillation (a rapid and irregular heartbeat), ventricular tachycardia (fast heartbeat originating from the lower chambers), and cardiac arrest due to shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.

In cases where a patient is experiencing shock-resistant ventricular arrhythmias including stable ventricular tachycardia or unstable ventricular fibrillation, amiodarone may be used. A recent study suggested that another antiarrhythmic, procainamide, may be more effective in stopping ventricular tachycardia – with less side effects and a higher survival rate in patients requiring multiple shocks. However, due to a small sample size and lack of statistical significance, more evidence is required, and amiodarone remains the drug of choice in ventricular arrhythmias.

Amiodarone is also commonly used as the first-line therapy for patients who receive shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators caused by ventricular arrhythmias. Combining amiodarone with beta-blockers has been shown to reduce the likelihood of experiencing inappropriate shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators.

===Cardiac arrest===
Defibrillation is the treatment of choice for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. While amiodarone has been used in shock-refractory cases, evidence of benefit is poor. Although amiodarone does not appear to improve survival in those who had a cardiac arrest in-hospital, some studies suggested that early administration of amiodarone was associated with better survival and positive outcomes for people who had a cardiac arrest out-of-hospital.

===Ventricular tachycardia===
Amiodarone may be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in certain instances. Individuals with hemodynamically &quot;unstable&quot; ventricular tachycardia &quot;should not&quot; initially receive amiodarone. These individuals should be cardioverted.

Amiodarone can be used in individuals with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia. In these cases, amiodarone can be used regardless of the individual&#x27;s underlying heart function and the type of ventricular tachycardia; it can be used in individuals with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, but is contraindicated in individuals with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as it is associated with a prolonged QT interval which will be made worse with anti-arrhythmic drugs.

===Atrial fibrillation===
Individuals who have undergone open heart surgery are at an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (or AF) in the first few days post-procedure. In the ARCH trial, intravenous amiodarone (2 g administered over 2 d) has been shown to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery when compared to placebo. However, clinical studies have failed to demonstrate long-term efficacy and have shown potentially fatal side effects such as pulmonary toxicities. While amiodarone is not approved for AF by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is a commonly prescribed off-label treatment due to the lack of equally effective treatment alternatives.

So-called &#x27;acute onset atrial fibrillation&#x27;, defined by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) in 2003, responds well to short-duration treatment with amiodarone. This has been demonstrated in seventeen randomized controlled trials, of which five included a placebo arm. The incidence of severe side effects in this group is low.

Amiodarone is an effective, antiarrhythmic-of-choice in achieving cardioversion to sinus rhythm in critical care populations with new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF). However, other anti-arrhythmic agents may exert superior rhythm control, rate control and lower mortality rate which may be more favourable than amiodarone in specific cases.

==Contraindications==
Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant are strongly advised not to take amiodarone. Since amiodarone can be expressed in breast milk, women taking the drug are advised to stop nursing.

It is contraindicated in individuals with sinus nodal bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and second or third-degree heart block who do not have an artificial pacemaker.

Individuals with baseline depressed lung function should be monitored closely if amiodarone therapy is to be initiated.

Formulations of amiodarone that contain benzyl alcohol should not be given to neonates, because the benzyl alcohol may cause the potentially fatal &quot;gasping syndrome&quot;.

Amiodarone can worsen the cardiac arrhythmia brought on by digitalis toxicity.

Contraindications of amiodarone also include:
* hypersensitivity to amiodarone or any of its components;
* severe hepatic impairment;
* sinus node dysfunction, including severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, since amiodarone can cause significant bradycardia and sinus nodal arrest;
* second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, due to its negative chronotropic (affecting the heart rate) and dromotropic (affecting the conductivity) effects on the AV conduction system, unless a pacemaker is implanted;
* thyrotoxicosis that cannot be controlled by conventional means, such as Graves&#x27; disease.

There are no specific guidelines for endurance or high-intensity exercise while taking amiodarone. However, since amiodarone may cause bradycardia and QTc prolongation which can affect exercise capacity and increase the risk of arrhythmias during intense exercise, it would generally be advisable for patients taking this medication to consult their healthcare provider before engaging in high-intensity physical activities such as strenuous endurance exercises.

== Side effects ==
At oral doses of 400 mg per day or higher, amiodarone can have serious, varied side effects, including toxicity to the thyroid gland, liver, lung, and retinal functions, requiring clinical surveillance and regular laboratory testing. Allergic reactions to amiodarone may occur. Most individuals administered amiodarone on a chronic basis will experience at least one side effect. In some people, daily use of amiodarone at 100 mg oral doses can be effective for arrhythmia control with no or minimal side effects.

Some common side effects include:
* nausea and vomiting;
* taste disturbances (changes in taste perception, often described as a metallic or bitter taste in the mouth);
* photosensitivity of the skin, also known as photodermatitis, where exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation may lead to skin reactions such as rashes or sunburn-like symptoms;
* corneal microdeposits (deposits may accumulate on the cornea over time, resulting in blurred vision or visual halosbright circles or rings around a light source, such as headlights; still, these corneal deposits typically do not affect vision significantly);
* thyroid dysfunction (in approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis; the drug can lead to both hypo- and hyperthyroidism);
* pulmonary toxicity (lung problems such as pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease may occur rarely but have the potential for serious consequences if left untreated);
* liver abnormalities (liver damage, including elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) and hepatotoxicity, although severe cases are rare);
* bradycardia and heart block (since it slows down heart rate by affecting the sinus node function and AV conduction system, it can increase the risk of heart block);
* QT Interval prolongation.

Amiodarone can potentially cause renal toxicity, but solid studies on whether amiodarone may be toxic to the kidneys are lacking.

===Lung===

Side effects of oral amiodarone at doses of 400 mg or higher include various pulmonary effects. The most serious reaction is interstitial lung disease. Risk factors include high cumulative dose, more than 400 milligrams per day, duration over two months, increased age, and preexisting pulmonary disease. Some individuals were noted to develop pulmonary fibrosis after a week of treatment, while others did not develop it after years of continuous use. Common practice is to avoid the agent if possible in individuals with decreased lung function.

The most specific test of pulmonary toxicity due to amiodarone is a dramatically decreased DLCO noted on pulmonary function testing.

=== Thyroid ===
Induced abnormalities in thyroid function are common. In approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Both under- and overactivity of the thyroid may occur.

Amiodarone is structurally similar to thyroxine and also contains iodine. Both of these factors contribute to the effects of amiodarone on thyroid function. Amiodarone also causes an anti-thyroid action, via Plummer and Wolff–Chaikoff effects, due its large amount of iodine in its molecule, which causes a particular &quot;cardiac hypothyroidism&quot; with bradycardia and arrhythmia.

Thyroid function should be checked at least every six months.
* Hypothyroidism (slowing of the thyroid) occurs frequently; in the SAFE trial, which compared amiodarone with other medications for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, biochemical hypothyroidism (as defined by a TSH level of 4.5–10 mU/L) occurred in 25.8% of the amiodarone-treated group as opposed to 6.6% of the control group (taking placebo or sotalol). Overt hypothyroidism (defined as TSH &gt;10 mU/L) occurred at 5.0% compared to 0.3%; most of these (&gt;90%) were detected within the first six months of amiodarone treatment.
* Amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), can be caused due to the high iodine content in the drug via the Jod-Basedow effect. This is known as Type 1 AIT, and usually occurs in patients with an underlying predisposition to hyperthyroidism such as Graves&#x27; disease, within weeks to months after starting amiodarone. Type 1 AIT is usually treated with anti-thyroid drugs or thyroidectomy. Type 2 AIT is caused by a destructive thyroiditis due to a direct toxic effect of amiodarone on thyroid follicular epithelial cells. Type 2 AIT can occur even years after starting amiodarone, is usually self-limited and responds to anti-inflammatory treatment such as corticosteroids. In practice, often the type of AIT is undetermined or presumed as mixed with both treatments combined. Thyroid uptake measurements (I-123 or I-131), which are used to differentiate causes of hyperthyroidism, are generally unreliable in patients who have been taking amiodarone. Because of the high iodine content of amiodarone, the thyroid gland is effectively saturated, thus preventing further uptake of isotopes of iodine. However, positive radioactive iodine can be used to rule in type 1AIT .

=== Eye ===
Corneal micro-deposits (cornea verticillata, also called vortex or whorl keratopathy) are almost universally present (over 90%) in individuals taking amiodarone longer than 6 months, especially doses greater than 400 mg/day. These deposits typically do not cause any symptoms. About 1 in 10 individuals may complain of a bluish halo. Anterior subcapsular lens deposits are relatively common (50%) in higher doses (greater than 600 mg/day) after 6 months of treatment.
Optic neuropathy, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (N-AION), occurs in 1–2% of people and is not dosage dependent. Bilateral optic disc swelling and mild and reversible visual field defects can also occur.

Loss of eyelashes has been linked to amiodarone use.

===Liver===
Abnormal liver enzyme results are common in people taking amiodarone. Much rarer are jaundice, hepatomegaly (liver enlargement), and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver).

In clinical observations, it has been noted that the administration of amiodarone, even at lower therapeutic doses, has been associated with the development of a condition mimicking alcoholic cirrhosis. This condition, often referred to as pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis, presents with similar histopathological features to those observed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, this extreme adverse event manifestation—pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis caused by low dose amiodarone—is very rare.

===Skin===
Long-term administration of amiodarone (usually more than eighteen months) is associated with a light-sensitive blue-grey discoloration of the skin, sometimes called ceruloderma; such patients should avoid exposure to the sun and use sunscreen that protects against ultraviolet-A and -B. The discoloration will slowly improve upon cessation of the medication, however, the skin color may not return completely.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Use during pregnancy may result in a number of problems in the infant including thyroid problems, heart problems, neurological problems, and preterm birth. Use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended though one dose may be okay.

===Other===
Long-term use of amiodarone has been associated with peripheral neuropathies.

Amiodarone is sometimes responsible for epididymitis. Amiodarone accumulates in the head of the organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped.

Some cases of gynecomastia have been reported in men on amiodarone.

A retrospective cohort study found an increased risk of digestive, liver, head and neck and liver cancers amongst male patients exposed to amiodarone versus female participants in the same study and the general population. This study also identified that the Standardized Incidence Ratio of cancer occurrence increased significantly in males aged 20-59 and &gt;80 years old who were exposed to a higher dose of Amiodarone in comparison to those exposed to a lower dose. This suggests that there is a dose-effect relationship. These results should be interpreted with caution due to limitations of the study design and care should be taken prior to altering current clinical and prescribing practices. Amiodarone and its effect on cancer is still a topic that requires more robust research.

== Drug-drug interactions ==
The pharmacokinetics of numerous drugs, including many that are commonly administered to individuals with heart disease, are affected by amiodarone.

Amiodarone has particularly important interactions with the following drugs:
* class I antiarrhythmics (amiodarone should not be combined with other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, etc., due to an increased risk of QTc prolongation and potential arrhythmias);
* beta blockers and calcium channel blockers (combining amiodarone with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, such as sotalol, can further slow down heart rate and cause bradycardia or heart block);
* digoxin (amiodarone inhibits a protein called P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which transports digoxin out of cells in the gut, liver, and kidneys, therefore, concurrent use of these medications increases digoxin levels in the body, potentially leading to digoxin toxicity);
* statins (amiodarone can inhibit enzymes in the liver responsible for metabolizing certain statins, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, etc., therefore interaction elevates plasma concentrations of these statins, increasing the risk of myopathy, that is muscle damage, or rhabdomyolysis, that is severe muscle breakdown);
* warfarin (since the anticoagulation effects of warfarin depend on metabolism of warfarin by both cytochromes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, coadministation leads to rise in international normalized ratio (INR)—the amount of time taken for the blood to form a clot—placing patient at higher bleeding risks); Amiodarone potentiates the action of warfarin by inhibiting the clearance of both (S) and (R) warfarin. Individuals taking both of these medications should have their warfarin doses adjusted based on their dosing of amiodarone and have their anticoagulation status (measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR)) measured more frequently. Dose reduction of warfarin is as follows: 40% reduction if the amiodarone dose is daily, 35% reduction if the amiodarone dose is daily, 30% reduction if the amiodarone dose is daily, and 25% reduction if amiodarone dose is daily. The effect of amiodarone on the warfarin concentrations can be as early as a few days after initiation of treatment; however, the interaction may not peak for up to seven weeks;
* anti-HIV medications (several HIV medications, such as ritonavir, indinavir, etc., interact with amiodarone by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzyme hence leading to decreased clearance of amiodarone, i.e., increasing the concentration of amiodarone in the organism).

Amiodarone inhibits the action of the cytochrome P450 isozyme family; such inhibition reduces the clearance of many drugs, including the following:
* ciclosporin,
* digoxin,
* flecainide,
* procainamide,
* quinidine,
* sildenafil,
* simvastatin,
* theophylline,
* warfarin.

In 2015, Gilead Sciences warned healthcare providers about people who began taking the hepatitis C drugs ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir along with amiodarone, who developed abnormally slow heartbeats or died of cardiac arrest.

==Metabolism==
Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, therefore, amiodarone and can affect the metabolism of numerous other drugs that depend on cytochrome P450, such as digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, etc.

The major metabolite of amiodarone is desethylamiodarone (DEA), which also has antiarrhythmic properties.

The metabolism of amiodarone is inhibited by grapefruit, leading to elevated serum levels of amiodarone.

On 8 August 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning of the risk of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure or death, when simvastatin is used with amiodarone. This interaction is dose-dependent with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg. This drug combination, especially with higher doses of simvastatin, should be avoided.

Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary metabolic pathway of amiodarone is by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. The metabolism of amiodaron can be characterized by two phases:

* phase I metabolism, when amiodarone undergoes oxidative processes mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8; these reactions result in the formation of several active metabolites, including desethylamiodarone (DEA) and di-desethylamiodarone (DDEA); DEA is the most abundant metabolite and exhibits similar pharmacological effects as amiodarone;
* phase II metabolism, when both amiodarone and its major metabolite DEA can undergo conjugation reactions with glucuronic acid; this process increases water solubility of these compounds for their efficient elimination from the body.

Amiodarone has an exceptionally long half-life due to a combination of several factors:
* high lipid solubility, given that amiodarone has high lipid solubility, which allows it to distribute throughout various tissues in the body rapidly; the extensive tissue distribution of amiodarone contributes to a large volume of distribution that leads to slow clearance from plasma compartments;
* extensive tissue binding, so that amiodarone extensively binds to different tissues, including fat deposits, muscles, heart tissue, and other organs; this binding creates reservoirs where drug release can occur slowly over time, resulting in an extended duration of action even after stopping the therapy;
* enterohepatic recycling, meaning that amiodarone undergoes enterohepatic recycling, where it is reabsorbed from the intestines after being excreted into bile, which contributes to its prolonged presence.

=== Excretion ===
Excretion is primarily via the liver and the bile duct with almost no elimination via the kidney and it is not dialyzable. Elimination half-life average of 58 days (ranging from 25 to 100 days [Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st edition]) for amiodarone and 36 days for the active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA). There is 10-50% transfer of amiodarone and DEA in the placenta as well as a presence in breast milk. Accumulation of amiodarone and DEA occurs in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs (i.e. liver, lungs), therefore, if an individual was taking amiodarone on a chronic basis if it is stopped it will remain in the system for weeks to months.

Whereas amiodarone is primarily eliminated from the body through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, a very small portion of amiodarone and its metabolites are excreted unchanged in urine or feces.

The liver plays a significant role in the elimination of amiodarone. After being extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, amiodarone is transported into bile via multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) transporter. Bile containing amiodarone and its metabolites is then released into the gastrointestinal tract.

Some of these compounds can be reabsorbed back into systemic circulation through enterohepatic recirculation, where they may undergo additional rounds of metabolism before eventually being excreted again into bile.

Because renal excretion contributes only minimally to the elimination of amiodarone, dose adjustment based on kidney function is generally not necessary. This is because most patients with normal renal function can adequately clear the drug through hepatic metabolism and biliary elimination pathways.

==Pharmacology==
Amiodarone is categorized as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, and prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, the repolarization phase where there is normally decreased calcium permeability and increased potassium permeability. It has numerous other effects, however, including actions that are similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV.

Amiodarone is a blocker of voltage gated potassium (KCNH2) and voltage gated calcium channels (CACNA2D2).

Amiodarone slows the conduction rate and prolongs the refractory period of the SA and AV nodes. It also prolongs the refractory periods of the ventricles, bundles of His, and the Purkinje fibers without exhibiting any effects on the conduction rate. Amiodarone has been shown to prolong the myocardial cell action potential duration and refractory period and is a non-competitive β-adrenergic inhibitor.

It also shows beta blocker-like and calcium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes, increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects, and slows intra-cardiac conduction of the cardiac action potential, via sodium-channel effects. It is suggested that amiodarone may also exacerbate the phenotype associated with Long QT-3 syndrome causing mutations such as ∆KPQ. This effect is due to a combination of blocking the peak sodium current, but also contributing to an increased persistent sodium current.

Amiodarone chemically resembles thyroxine (thyroid hormone), and its binding to the nuclear thyroid receptor might contribute to some of its pharmacologic and toxic actions.
The mechanisms of action of amiodarone include blocking potassium ion channels (prolonging repolarization), blocking sodium ion channels, and antagonizing alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.
The action of amiodarone can be characterized by the following effects:
* potassium channel blockade, since amiodarone blocks potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarization during phase 3 of the action potential, so that this blockade prolongs the duration of cardiac action potentials, resulting in an increased refractory period and decreased excitability;
* sodium channel blockade, characterized by inhibiting sodium ion influx through voltage-gated sodium channels, so that amiodarone reduces the conduction velocity of electrical impulses in cardiac tissue that leads to a slowed heart rate and improved rhythm control;
* calcium channel blockade, by inhibiting L-type calcium channels in myocardial cells, decreasing intracellular calcium concentration during ventricular contraction;
* noncompetitive adrenergic receptor antagonism, meaning that amiodarone has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonistic effects, which help reduce sympathetic stimulation on the heart.

==History==
The original observation that amiodarone&#x27;s progenitor molecule, khellin, had cardioactive properties, was made by the Russian physiologist Gleb von Anrep while working in Cairo in 1946. Khellin is obtained from a plant extract of Khella or &quot;Ammi visnaga&quot;, a common plant in north Africa. Anrep noticed that one of his technicians had been cured of anginal symptoms after taking khellin, then used for various, non-cardiac ailments. This led to efforts by European pharmaceutical industries to isolate an active compound. Amiodarone was initially developed in 1961 at the Labaz company, Belgium, by chemists Tondeur and Binon, who were working on preparations derived from khellin. It became popular in Europe as a treatment for angina pectoris.

As a doctoral candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that amiodarone and sotalol had antiarrhythmic properties and belonged to a new class of antiarrhythmic agents (what would become the class III antiarrhythmic agents). Today the mechanisms of action of amiodarone and sotalol have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the action potential, prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular functions with K+ channels.

Based on Singh&#x27;s work, the Argentinian physician Mauricio Rosenbaum began using amiodarone to treat his patients who have supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with impressive results. Based on papers written by Rosenbaum developing Singh&#x27;s theories, physicians in the United States began prescribing amiodarone to their patients with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in the late 1970s.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was reluctant to officially approve the use of amiodarone since initial reports had shown an increased incidence of serious pulmonary side effects of the drug. In the mid-1980s, the European pharmaceutical companies began putting pressure on the FDA to approve amiodarone by threatening to cut the supply to American physicians if it was not approved. In December 1985, amiodarone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of arrhythmias.

=== Name ===
Amiodarone may be an acronym for its IUPAC name (2-butyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-[4-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]-3,5-diiodophenyl]methanone, where ar is a placeholder for phenyl. This is partially supported by dronedarone which is noniodinated benzofuran derivative of amiodarone, where the arylmethanone is conserved.

==Dosing==
Amiodarone is available in oral and intravenous formulations.

Orally, it is available under the brand names Pacerone (produced by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc.) and Cordarone (produced by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories). It is also available under the brand name Aratac (produced by Alphapharm Pty Ltd) in Australia and New Zealand, and further in Australia under the brands Cardinorm and Rithmik as well as a number of generic brands. Also Arycor in South Africa (Produced by Winthrop Pharmaceuticals.). In South America, it is known as Atlansil and is produced by Roemmers.

In India, amiodarone is marketed (produced by Cipla Pharmaceutical) under the brand name Tachyra. It is also available in intravenous ampules and vials.

The dose of amiodarone administered is tailored to the individual and the dysrhythmia that is being treated. When administered orally, the bioavailability of amiodarone is quite variable. Absorption ranges from 22 to 95%, with better absorption when it is given with food.

<text>A yellow-dog contract (a yellow-dog clause of a contract, also known as an ironclad oath) is an agreement between an employer and an employee in which the employee agrees, as a condition of employment, not to be a member of a labor union. In the United States, such contracts were used by employers to prevent the formation of unions, most often by permitting employers to take legal action against union organizers. In 1932, yellow-dog contracts were outlawed in the United States under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

==Origin of term and brief history==
In the 1870s, a written agreement containing a pledge not to join a union was commonly referred to as the &quot;Infamous Document&quot;. This strengthens the belief that American employers in their resort to individual contracts were consciously following English precedents. This anti-union pledge was also called an &quot;iron clad document,&quot; and from this time until the close of the 19th century &quot;iron-clad&quot; was the customary name for the non-union promise. Beginning with New York in 1887, sixteen states wrote on their statute books declarations making it a criminal act to force employees to agree not to join unions. The Congress of the United States incorporated in the Erdman Act of 1898 a provision relating to carriers engaged in interstate commerce.

During the last decade of the 19th century and the opening years of the 20th, the individual, anti-union promise declined in importance as an instrument in labor warfare. Its novelty had worn off; workers no longer felt themselves morally bound to live up to it and union organizers, of course, wholly disregarded it. In the early 20th century, the individual, anti-union promise was resorted to frequently in coal mining and in the metal trades. And it was not membership in a union that was usually prohibited, but participation in those essential activities without which membership is valueless.

In 1910, the International United Brotherhood of Leather Workers on Horse Goods, following an unsuccessful conference with the National Saddlery Manufacturers&#x27; Association, called a national strike in the saddlery industry for the 8-hour day. The strike proved a failure, and a large number of employers required oral or written promises to abandon and remain out of the organization as a condition of re-employment.

In the case &quot;Adair v. United States&quot;, the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s majority held that the provision of the Erdman Act relating to discharge, because it would compel an employer to accept or retain the personal services of another person against the employer&#x27;s will, was a violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that no person shall be deprived of liberty or property without due process of law. The court was careful, however, to restrict the decision to the provision relating to discharge, and to express no opinion as to the remainder of the law. The section of the Erdman Act making it criminal to force employees to sign anti-union agreements therefore remained unadjudicated.

The term &quot;yellow dog&quot; started appearing in the spring of 1921, in leading articles and editorials devoted to the subject which appeared in the labor press. Typical was the comment of the editor of the &quot;United Mine Workers&#x27; Journal&quot;: &quot;This agreement has been well named. It is yellow dog for sure. It reduces to the level of a yellow dog any man that signs it, for he signs away every right he possesses under the Constitution and laws of the land and makes himself the truckling, helpless slave of the employer.&quot;

Even though they were forbidden in the private sector by the Norris–LaGuardia Act in 1932, yellow dog contracts were allowed in public sector, including many government jobs, such as teachers, until the 1960s, beginning with precedent established in 1915 with &quot;Frederick v. Owens&quot;.

In 1932, Joel I. Seidman wrote the first-ever book on the topic, &quot;The Yellow Dog Contract&quot;. It traced their history from the 1830s in the United Kingdom, the 1870s in the United States, the use of the term &quot;yellow dog&quot; following World War I, to a land-mark event when the U.S. Senate rejected the nomination of Judge John J. Parker to the United States Supreme Court.

<doc id="657267" wikidata="Q353420" url="?curid=657267" title="Reggie Fils-Aimé">
<text>Reginald Fils-Aimé ( ; born March 25, 1961) is an American businessman best known for being the president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America, the North American branch of the Japanese video game company Nintendo, from 2006 to 2019. Prior to his promotion to president and COO, Fils-Aimé was executive vice president of sales and marketing.

Fils-Aimé gained celebrity status among gamers following his appearance at Nintendo&#x27;s E3 2004 press conference in May 2004, and helped to revitalize Nintendo&#x27;s image as a major contender among the other video game console makers, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Microsoft. Fils-Aimé had held previous sales and marketing executive roles at Procter &amp; Gamble, Pizza Hut, Guinness, Derby Cycle, Panda Express, and VH1.

Fils-Aimé retired as president of Nintendo of America on April 15, 2019, after an announcement on February 21, and was succeeded by Doug Bowser. He subsequently became a Leader in Residence at Cornell University and later named to the board of directors for Brunswick Corporation, GameStop, and Spin Master.

== Early life ==
Reginald Fils-Aimé was born on March 25, 1961, in The Bronx, New York City. His parents had immigrated to the United States from Haiti in the 1950s due to conflicting political views of his grandparents; his paternal grandfather was a general when the Haitian military overthrew the democratically elected government, which included his maternal grandfather. Fils-Aimé&#x27;s mother worked as a lead sales representative in a fine jewelry store and his father was a machinist. Fils-Aimé has said that he adopted his optimistic attitude from his mother. He was raised on Long Island, where he attended Brentwood High School; he described himself as the &quot;lone minority&quot; among his classmates.
He was accepted into Cornell University in 1979, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in applied economics and management from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1983. He was president of the school&#x27;s Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity chapter, where he was described as being neat and organized.

== Career ==
Fils-Aimé took a job at Procter &amp; Gamble in the company&#x27;s brand management program. He also took a position as senior director of national marketing at Pizza Hut, where he launched the Bigfoot Pizza and the Big New Yorker.

Fils-Aimé served as the Head of Marketing for Guinness Imports Co. in the United States and was responsible for all brands. He also worked as chief marketing officer at Derby Cycle, directing sales and marketing efforts worldwide for eight brands. Fils-Aimé served as managing director and oversaw Raleigh U.K., Derby&#x27;s British operations.

He then joined the American Chinese food company Panda Management Co. acting as senior vice-president. He also joined MTV&#x27;s VH1 network in 2001 as senior vice-president and left in 2003. Fils-Aimé was responsible for a 30% increase in ratings for the VH1 network by shifting the channel&#x27;s focus to appeal to younger viewers. As part of his role at VH1, Fils-Aimé also laid out and implemented a marketing strategy for The Concert for New York City, which garnered more than $35 million for disaster relief following the September 11 attacks.

===Nintendo===

Fils-Aimé joined Nintendo in December 2003 as the executive vice president of sales and marketing. Fils-Aimé had been recruited for the position, but during the interview period, he said that he had asked to see Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo, which was considered highly unusual but was granted. His conversation with Iwata went far longer than planned and it helped to establish the friendly relationship Fils-Aimé had with Iwata for more than a decade which, according to Fils-Aimé, helped with open communications and understanding to help Nintendo improve overall as a business. Because of this, Fils-Aimé has called Iwata his mentor as well as a &quot;dear friend&quot; throughout his time at Nintendo.

Fils-Aimé was initially responsible for all sales and marketing activities for Nintendo in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. On May 25, 2006, Fils-Aimé became the president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America after former president, Tatsumi Kimishima, was moved to his new role as chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Fils-Aimé was the first American to hold this position.

At the time Fils-Aimé was hired in 2003, the video game industry was stagnant in major markets, and Nintendo&#x27;s competitors Microsoft and Sony Computer Entertainment were looking to regain interest by building more powerful home consoles. For Nintendo, it had recently come off re-organization of upper management, including Iwata being named its president only the year prior. The company was producing the GameCube, but Iwata and other Nintendo executives saw that most titles being produced were sequels with almost no new intellectual property. Fils-Aimé said that the decision for Nintendo to differ from its competitors and try to bring back fun into video games was made before he had been hired, and part of that was planned through Fils-Aimé&#x27;s marketing skills and presence.

Fils-Aimé became a recognized public face for Nintendo at the 2004 E3. The year prior, Nintendo&#x27;s press conference was considered a quiet and dry affair compared to the conferences given by Microsoft and Sony Computer Entertainment; while Iwata and other Japanese executives were present, the only American on stage was George S. Harrison and had remained stoic during the conference. Nintendo was also losing in the sixth console generation. The GameCube was struggling against the PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox console, and long-time Nintendo fans were despondent over Nintendo&#x27;s current state. Fils-Aimé served to lead off the 2004 conference as his first introduction to the public. He led off the conference with &quot;My name is Reggie. I&#x27;m about kickin&#x27; ass, I&#x27;m about takin&#x27; names, and &quot;we&#x27;re&quot; about makin&#x27; games.&quot; His presentation was considered aggressive, and at one point directly attacked the approaches that Microsoft and Sony were taking with handling of video game content on their consoles. This message had been thoroughly planned by the upper management of Nintendo and Fils-Aimé had expressed caution to them about the tone of the message, but they still wanted him to deliver it. His theatrical antics, flying in the face of Nintendo&#x27;s long-standing conservative image, gained a cult following soon after, with many gamers calling him the &quot;Regginator&quot;, a play on the character of the Terminator.

Following the conference, many images of him spread across the Web. In interviews years after the 2004 event, Fils-Aimé said that his presentation was not his idea, but writing from the public relations department, and he himself had to be convinced to give the aggressive approach. Fils-Aimé&#x27;s presentation was considered by others the right attitude that Nintendo needed to present at the time to show themselves still relevant in the current console generation and was no longer taking a conservative approach to gaming.
Fils-Aimé is considered to be responsible for revamping Nintendo&#x27;s public relations in North America, leading many fans and members of the press to dub his arrival the &quot;Reggielution&quot; (after &quot;Revolution&quot;, the code name for the Wii). He had not only considered the constantly-changing challenges of marketing to youth, but as well as continuing to address the older video game players, who were still a key market for Nintendo. He further believed that addressing all demographics would be like a rising tide for the industry with Nintendo positioned to capture that the best. While still in sales, Fils-Aimé rewrote how Nintendo worked with vendors; instead of having Nintendo try to seek vendors&#x27; favor and better in-store place by assuring Nintendo could meet demand, Fils-Aimé created agreements where vendors would only get Nintendo&#x27;s stock in stores if vendors ordered high volumes of their product. This served to help with the success and popularity of the Nintendo DS. He has attributed the success of the Wii to a marketing strategy laid out by Clayton Christensen:


On July 11, 2007, while introducing the Wii Balance Board, Fils-Aimé walked up onto the stage and stated “My body is ready.” This quotation would eventually become a meme and Fils-Aimé acknowledged the phrase several times, including at the E3 2012 conference, his appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and his resignation announcement video. When Iwata implemented their Nintendo Direct online press conferences, Fils-Aimé would frequently participate in these alongside Iwata, including a mock Mii-avatar battle, which similarly became the subject of several memes. In other public press presentations for Nintendo, Fils-Aimé has been involved with skits with production support from Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, Mega64, and The Jim Henson Company.

On November 5, 2007, at the encouragement of marketing professor Ed McLaughlin in the department of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University, Fils-Aimé gave a guest lecture on Nintendo&#x27;s marketing strategy targeted at gamers across a spectrum of demographics. Fils-Aimé was a member of the advisory council for Cornell&#x27;s Communication department from 2008 to 2021.
In 2016 and early 2017, Fils-Aimé was featured in two episodes of Deadlock, on the Game Theorists web show, debating about various Nintendo-related topics.

Fils-Aimé announced his resignation as the company&#x27;s president and COO on February 21, 2019, which took effect on April 15, 2019. He was replaced by the company&#x27;s then-head of sales, Doug Bowser. Fils-Aimé stated he started thinking about retirement after Iwata&#x27;s death in 2015: &quot;It also reinforced for me the legacy that he had built, and he had created for the company. And that really drove me to be introspective around, &#x27;So what&#x27;s the legacy that I want to build, that I want to leave?&#x27;&quot; He waited until he felt Nintendo of America was on solid footing for positive growth, which occurred by early 2019, to begin the process of retiring. His decision to retire was emboldened by the success of the Nintendo Switch, a hybrid game console the company released in 2017 which by the end of 2018 had already reached over 32 million sales. He believed with the Switch, which he had compared to Nintendo&#x27;s previously successful Wii and Nintendo DS consoles, &quot;the company was going to be in great shape for at least a few years&quot;.

===Post-Nintendo===
After leaving Nintendo, Fils-Aimé created his own Twitter account under the name @Reggie and made his first tweet saying, &quot;Hi Twitter community.&quot;

Fils-Aimé announced he had been brought on as the first Leader in Residence at Cornell University&#x27;s Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management starting in October 2019. Fils-Aimé had already been on the advisory board for Dyson as well as for Cornell&#x27;s department of communications prior to this appointment, and was approached by Cornell shortly after his retirement announcement about the opportunity. In addition, Fils-Aimé joined the board of directors for the New York Videogame Critics Circle, and became a managing partner in Brentwood Growth Partners, an equity firm based in Kirkland, Washington. Through his positions at Cornell and through the New York Videogame Critics Circle, he wants to provide mentorship opportunities for youth and young adults as to encourage them to grow and become &quot;leaders across a range of as many different disciplines as possible&quot;. Through the Residence program he plans to present his &quot;Seven Principles for Next Generation Leaders&quot; that he had learned over his career, and will work with the New York Videogame Critics Circle to help younger students in programs like the DreamYard Academy at William Howard Taft High School to show the students &quot;the work that&#x27;s done through the power of video games, using video games as the medium to teach critical thinking, to teach writing skills&quot;. Fils-Aimé stated these also help him give back to both the community he was raised in and to his alma mater.

Fils-Aimé, who had participated in The Game Awards since its creation in 2015, presented at The Game Awards 2019. GameStop named Fils-Aimé along two others onto its board of directors in March 2020, replacing several directors that were leaving as part of the company&#x27;s efforts to turn the company&#x27;s profitability around. He and several of GameStop&#x27;s board members were slated to resign around June 2021 based on SEC filings. He was also named to Spin Master&#x27;s board of directors in May 2020.

After the COVID-19 pandemic began, Fils-Aimé announced that he and video games journalist Harold Goldberg would start a podcast, &quot;Talking Games with Reggie and Harold&quot;, in conjunction with the New York Video Game Critics Circle. The podcast is aimed to raise charitable funds for the non-profit group to help mentor lower-income and under-served students in New York City impacted by the pandemic. Fils-Aimé was added to the board of directors at Brunswick Corporation on October 27, 2020, and later authored a book titled &quot;Disrupting the Game: From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo&quot; released in April 2022.

==Accolades==
Fils-Aimé has been recognized for his marketing expertise in the advertising industry, including receiving a Clio Award, two Gold Effie Awards, an Association of Independent Commercial Producers Award for advertising excellence, a Silver Edison from the American Marketing Institute, and was named one of the &quot;Marketing 100&quot; in 1998 by &quot;Advertising Age&quot;. From the video game industry, Fils-Aimé was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the International Video Game Hall of Fame and has received the Legend Award from the New York Videogame Critics Circle.

==Personal life==
Fils-Aimé is married to Stacey Sanner, his longtime girlfriend whom he met in his previous position at VH1. He has three children from a previous marriage. Fils-Aimé started playing video games with his children when they were 2 and 5 years old. he lived on the Eastside of Seattle.

<text>Comic Sans MS (most commonly referred to as Comic Sans) is a sans-serif typeface created and designed by Vincent Connare and released by Microsoft Corporation in 1994. Designed as a non-connecting script, the typeface draws inspiration from comic book lettering, to emulate the informal and cartoonish tone of speech bubbles. It was originally developed for use in Microsoft&#x27;s software, and since then has become very widely recognized for its use in casual contexts such as children&#x27;s books, personal documentation and in educational resources.

The typeface was first introduced with Microsoft Windows as a part of the Microsoft Plus! Pack, and was later implemented into Microsoft Comic Chat as a comic styled chat application. Since then, Microsoft has described the font as &quot;casual and legible&quot; and a typeface which has garnered much popularity across a diverse set of user groups.

Comic Sans has however become a cultural phenomenon, gaining significant criticism and mockery due to its perceived over usage and misuse in professional and formal settings. Despite this, the font continues to hold a devoted fan base, particularly among education professionals and those in search of approachable and simplistic typefaces for specific uses.

== History ==
=== Development and release ===
Microsoft designer Vincent Connare began working on Comic Sans in 1994 after having already created other fonts for various applications. When he saw a beta version of Microsoft Bob that used Times New Roman in the word balloons of its cartoon characters, he believed the typeface gave the software an overly formal appearance. He believed this was inappropriate for the aesthetics of the program, which was created to introduce younger users to computers. In order to make Microsoft Bob look more suitable for its intended purposes, he decided to create a new typeface with only a mouse and cursor, based on the lettering style of comic books he had in his office, specifically &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; (lettered by John Costanza) and &quot;Watchmen&quot; (lettered by Dave Gibbons).

He completed Comic Sans too late for inclusion in Microsoft Bob, and the typeface would go unreleased until the programmers of Microsoft 3D Movie Maker, which also used cartoon guides and speech bubbles, adopted it. The speech bubbles were eventually phased out and replaced by actual sound, but Comic Sans stayed for the program&#x27;s pop-up windows and help sections. The typeface later shipped with the Windows 95 Plus! Pack, and was the primary font of the Travel desktop theme. It was later included as a system font for the OEM versions of Windows 95. Finally, it became one of the default fonts for Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Comic Sans is also used in Microsoft Comic Chat, which was released in 1996 with Internet Explorer 3.0.

Comic Sans is pre-installed in macOS and Windows Phone but not Android, iOS or Linux. Comic Sans can be manually downloaded on iOS.

===Comic Sans Pro (2011)===
Comic Sans Pro is an updated version of Comic Sans created by Terrance Weinzierl from Monotype Imaging. While retaining the original designs of the core characters, it expands the typeface by adding new italic variants, in addition to swashes, small capitals, extra ornaments and symbols including speech bubbles, onomatopoeia and dingbats, as well as text figures and other stylistic alternatives. Originally appearing as part of Ascender 2010 Font Pack as Comic Sans 2010, it was first released on April Fools&#x27; Day, causing some to initially assume it was a joke.

The italicized variant later appeared in Windows 8.

==Misuse==
Comic Sans has become most infamous for its use in serious circumstances, such as warning signs and formal documents, in which it might appear too informal, unprofessional, or inappropriate.

During the summer of 2010, NBA superstar LeBron James left the Cleveland Cavaliers in free agency, in a highly publicized media affair that culminated in a TV special called &quot;The Decision&quot;. The majority owner of the team (at the time), Dan Gilbert, reacted by posting a letter to Cavalier fans. The letter was criticized for its use of Comic Sans.

In October 2012, a Dutch World War II memorial called &quot;Verzoening&quot; (&quot;Reconciliation&quot;) was revealed on which the names of Jewish, Allied and German military deaths alike were written alongside each other in Comic Sans. The names were eventually scraped off after complaints from Jewish organizations, but the rewritten message was once again in Comic Sans. According to the city government, this was done because the letters fit the shape of the stone and were easily visible from a distance. It was, however, criticized for making the memorial appear &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;cheap&quot;.

In September 2014, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; printed a front page with Comic Sans, causing an uproar, despite its use being within speech bubbles in keeping with the origin of the typeface.

In May 2015, after the presidential elections in Poland, the dean of the Faculty of Law and Administration of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków sent a congratulatory letter to president-elect Andrzej Duda, who was a graduate and employee of that faculty, written in Comic Sans.

In August 2015, a number of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras&#x27;s Syriza party members split and formed a new party, headed by Panagiotis Lafazanis. The official document of resignation was allegedly written in Comic Sans.

In July 2018, a statue of former Chilean President Pedro Aguirre Cerda was inaugurated in Santiago. The plaques on the monument were written in Comic Sans, drawing negative attention on social media.

In October 2019, when the United States House Intelligence Committee requested that two of Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruma, present documentation regarding their involvement in the Ukraine scandal, former Trump attorney John Dowd penned a letter of explanation printed in Comic Sans.

That same month, as part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Brexit debate, the Conservative Party tweeted an image stating &quot;MPs must come together and get Brexit done&quot; using Comic Sans. The post was heavily mocked, but some commentators saw it as a deliberate attempt to use the typeface&#x27;s notoriety in order to bring their message to a wider audience.

==Legibility==

A research article published by &quot;Cognition&quot; in 2010 showed disfluency could lead to improved retention and classroom performance. The article stated that disfluency can be produced merely by adopting fonts that are slightly more difficult to read. In the case studies cited in the article, Comic Sans was used to introduce disfluency. A 2010 Princeton University study involving presenting students with text in a font slightly harder to read found that they consistently retained more information from material displayed in fonts perceived as ugly or incoherent (Monotype Corsiva, Haettenschweiler, and Comic Sans Italic) than in a simpler, more traditional typeface such as Helvetica.

More often, however, Comic Sans is described as especially legible, and is frequently used in school settings or as an aid for people with dyslexia. Some people have reported that typing in Comic Sans has helped to clear writer&#x27;s block, claiming that its casual appearance and high legibility create less mental tension. Compared to other typefaces, Comic Sans has fewer rotated and mirror-image glyphs (ex. the letters &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;q&quot;), has particularly wide letter spacing, and is sans serif in general, although its capital &quot;i&quot; (I) has serifs to distinguish it from lowercase &quot;l&quot; (l).

==Reception and legacy==

Several reinterpretations of Comic Sans have been created as a result of its popularity. In April 2014, font designer Craig Rozynski released a modernized version of Comic Sans called Comic Neue. In 2015, graphic designer Ben Harman created Comic Papyrus (later renamed &quot;Comic Parchment&quot; for legal reasons), which combines the features of Comic Sans with the similarly panned typeface Papyrus. In 2019, Tabular Type Foundry released Comic Code, a monospaced version of the typeface.

In 2017, it was reported that Vincent Connare, the typeface&#x27;s designer, had only used it once.

===Opposition===
Because of its ubiquity and misuse, Comic Sans has received heavy disapproval from graphic and type designers. The &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; reported on disgruntlement over the widespread use of the typeface, especially its inappropriate use for writing on serious subjects, with the complaints urged on by a campaign started by two Indianapolis graphic designers, Dave and Holly Combs, via their website &quot;Ban Comic Sans&quot;. The movement was conceived in 1999 by the two designers after an employer insisted that one of them use Comic Sans in a children&#x27;s museum exhibit. The website&#x27;s main argument is that a typeface should match the tone of its text and that the humorous appearance of Comic Sans often contrasted with a serious message, such as a &quot;do not enter&quot; sign. The movement ran until 2019, when Dave Combs believed the hatred had &quot;gotten out of hand&quot;. While the website &quot;Ban Comic Sans&quot; is no longer in use, searching the title today will direct viewers to a linktr.ee page, where the campaign is still going strong. This chain of websites connects to an online merch store on Zazzle.com, an informational video on Vimeo and an official facebook page for the movement. A newer version of the website by the name of Comic Sans Criminal has also gained popularity in recent years 

Dave Gibbons, whose work was one of the inspirations for Comic Sans, condemned the typeface, stating that it was &quot;a shame they couldn&#x27;t have used just the original font, because [Comic Sans] is a real mess. I think it&#x27;s a particularly ugly letter form.&quot;

Film producer and &quot;The New York Times&quot; essayist Errol Morris wrote in an August 2012 posting, &quot;The conscious awareness of Comic Sans promotes—at least among some people—contempt and summary dismissal.&quot; With the help of a professor, he conducted an online experiment and found that Comic Sans, in comparison with five other typefaces (Baskerville, Helvetica, Georgia, Trebuchet MS, and Computer Modern), makes readers slightly less likely to believe that a statement they are reading is true.

===Defense===
In the Netherlands, radio DJs Coen Swijnenberg and Sander Lantinga decided to celebrate the typeface by having a Comic Sans day on the first Friday of July. Comic Sans Day has been held since 2009. Some Dutch companies have their website in Comic Sans on this day.

According to a 2020 X poll held by TES, 44% of teachers sampled used Comic Sans in their teaching resources. Comic Sans is widely used in schools due to its high legibility. Other reasons include:

* It is more suitable for dyslexic students.
* It is well-suited for modeling handwriting, due to the single-story lowercase &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, and distinct appearances of the letters codice_1 and codice_2.
* It is aesthetically pleasing to some children.

Vincent Connare is reportedly not offended by the negative backlash over Comic Sans. At the Fourth Annual Boring Conference, he claimed to find the contempt for his work to be &quot;mildly amusing.&quot; He has stated that he is proud of his creation, offering different rationales. One of these was that &quot;Comic Sans does what it was commissioned to do, it is loved by kids, mums, dads and many family members. So it did its job very well. It matched the brief!&quot; He has also referred to it as &quot;the best joke I&#x27;ve ever told.&quot; In 2014, commenting on Comic Sans&#x27; critics and fans alike, Connare said, &quot;If you love it, you don&#x27;t know much about typography, [but] if you hate it, you really don&#x27;t know much about typography either, and you should get another hobby.&quot;

Lauren Hudgins of &quot;The Establishment&quot; argued that people who use Comic Sans should be treated with respect, not mockery, because &quot;people without dyslexia need empathy for those who need concessions to manage the disability.&quot; Defenders of Comic Sans also argue that the criticism the font receives is oftentimes exaggerated, and that its benefits deserve more credit. 

===In popular culture===

Comic Sans status as a meme became a defining point in its legacy. Because of this, many people began to use the font with irony and sarcasm in internet memes and pop culture. It has also been used in political campaigns and the communications of public figures, which has drawn some attention.

In 2010, when LeBron James was criticized by Dan Gilbert, owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, for leaving the team in a published letter that heavily utilized Comic Sans.

In 2019, Fast Company writer Mark Wilson penned an emotionally charged article which shamed President Trump and his staff for utilizing the font type in important statements.

Searching for &#x27;comic sans&#x27; or &#x27;comic sans ms&#x27; on Google Search will cause the results page to be displayed entirely in Comic Sans. 

In the 2005 session of the youth model parliament in Ontario, Canada, the New Democratic Party included the clause, &quot;Ban the font known as Comic Sans&quot; in an omnibus ban bill.

On May 22, 2012, The Comic Sans Song was released by YouTube content creator and musician Gunnarolla, in collaboration with musician Andrew Huang. The song makes reference to Comic Sans and features commentary around the impact the font has had on pop-culture.

In July 2012, when the discovery of the Higgs boson was announced at CERN, Fabiola Gianotti, the spokesperson of the ATLAS experiment, attracted comment by using Comic Sans in her presentation of the results. As a 2014 April Fools&#x27; Day joke, CERN claimed that it would be switching all its publications to Comic Sans.

The Internet meme Doge, which became popular in late 2013, consists of different colored sets of words in broken English written in Comic Sans around the head of a Shiba Inu dog.

In April 2014, OpenBSD announced the LibreSSL project in Comic Sans, claiming to be the first to &quot;weaponize&quot; it as a means for soliciting donations.

In the 2015 video game &quot;Undertale&quot; and its followup &quot;Deltarune&quot;, the character Sans is a comedian skeleton named after the typeface. His dialogue is displayed in lowercase Comic Sans. He is paired with his brother named Papyrus, in reference to the typeface of the same name. This has however increased the typeface&#x27;s popularity in some ways, showing it as an endearing presence, that many can take joy in, regardless of its nature.

<text>Phone fraud, or more generally communications fraud, is the use of telecommunications products or services with the intention of illegally acquiring money from, or failing to pay, a telecommunication company or its customers.

Many operators have increased measures to minimize fraud and reduce their losses. Communications operators tend to keep their actual loss figures and plans for corrective measures confidential.

According to a 2011 survey by CFCA, an industry group created to reduce fraud against carriers, the five top fraud loss categories reported by operators were:
* $4.96 billion – compromised PBX/voicemail systems
* $4.32 billion – subscription/identity theft
* $3.84 billion – International Revenue Share Fraud
* $2.88 billion – by-pass fraud
* $2.40 billion – cash fraud

== Types of frauds ==

=== Fraud against users by phone companies ===
* &quot;Cramming&quot; is the addition of charges to a subscriber&#x27;s telephone bill for services which were neither ordered nor desired by the client, or for fees for calls or services that were not properly disclosed to the client. These charges are often assessed by dishonest third-party suppliers of data and communication service that phone companies are required, by law, to allow the third-party to place on the bill.
* &quot;Slamming&quot; is any fraudulent, unauthorized change to the default long-distance/local carrier or DSL Internet service selection for a subscriber&#x27;s line, most often made by dishonest vendors desiring to steal business from competing service providers.
* &quot;False Answer Supervision&quot; is a misconfiguration of telephone company equipment, by negligence or design, which causes billing to start as soon as the distant telephone begins ringing, even if a call is busy or there is no answer. The cost is typically subtle but recurring as subscribers repeatedly pay some small amount for calls which were never completed.

=== Fraud against customers by third parties ===
* PBX dial-through can be used fraudulently by placing a call to a business then requesting to be transferred to &quot;9-0&quot; or some other outside toll number. (9 is normally an outside line and 0 then connects to the utility&#x27;s operator.) The call appears to originate from the business (instead of the original fraudulent caller) and appears on the company&#x27;s phone bill. Trickery (such as impersonation of installer and telecommunications company personnel &quot;testing the system&quot;) or bribery and collusion with dishonest employees inside the firm may be used to gain access.
* A variant is a call forwarding scam, where a fraudster tricks a subscriber into call forwarding their number to either a long-distance number or a number at which the fraudster or an accomplice is accepting collect calls. The unsuspecting subscriber then gets a huge long-distance bill for all of these calls.
* A similar scheme involves forwarding an individual PBX extension to a long-distance or overseas number; the PBX owner must pay tolls for all of these calls. Voice over IP servers are often flooded with brute-force attempts to register bogus off-premises extensions (which may then be forwarded or used to make calls) or to directly call SIP addresses which request outside numbers on a gateway; as they are computers, they are targets for Internet system crackers.
* Autodialers may be used for a number of dishonest purposes, including telemarketing fraud or even as wardialing, which takes its name from a scene in the 1983 movie WarGames in which a &#x27;cracker&#x27; programs a home computer to dial every number in an exchange, searching for lines with auto-answer data modems. Sequential dialing is easy to detect, pseudo-random dialing is not.
* In the US, owners of customer-owned coin-operated telephones (COCOTs) are paid sixty cents for every call their users make to a toll-free telephone number, with the charges billed to the called number. A fraudulent COCOT provider could potentially auto-dial 1-800 wrong numbers and get paid for these as &quot;calls received from a payphone&quot; with charges reversed.
* Autodialers are also used to make many short-duration calls, mainly to mobile devices, leaving a missed call number which is either premium rate or contains advertising messages, in the hope that the victim will call back. This is known as Wangiri (literally, &quot;One (ring) and cut&quot;) from Japan where it originated.
* 809 scams take their name from the former +1-809 area code which used to cover most of the Caribbean nations, since split into multiple new area codes, adding to the confusion. The numbers are advertised as offering services to callers in, typically, North America; they look like Canadian or US telephone numbers but are actually costly premium international calls that bypass consumer-protection laws that regulate premium numbers based in the victim&#x27;s home country. Some advertise phone sex or other typically premium content. Ways to elicit calls include leaving unsolicited messages on pagers, or making bogus claims of being a relative in a family emergency to trick users into calling the number, then attempting to keep the victim on the expensive call for as long as possible. A later version of the 809 scam involves calling cellular telephones then hanging up, in hopes of the curious (or annoyed) victim calling them back. This is the Wangiri scam, with the addition of using Caribbean numbers such as 1-473 (Grenada) which look like North American domestic calls.
* Pre-paid telephone cards or &quot;calling cards&quot; are vulnerable to fraudulent use. These cards show an access number that can be dialed to bill worldwide toll calls to the card via a passcode printed on a particular card. Anyone who obtains the passcode can make calls charged to the card.
* Carrier access codes were widely misused by phone-sex scammers in the early days of competitive long distance; the phone-sex operations would misrepresent themselves as alternate long-distance carriers to evade consumer protection measures which prevent US phone subscribers from losing local or long-distance service due to calls to +1-900 or 976 premium numbers. This loophole is now closed.
* In the US, area code 500 and its overlays permit a &quot;follow-me routing&quot; in which, if the number has been forwarded to some expensive and arbitrary destination, the caller is billed for the call to that location. Similar issues existed with area code 700 as the numbers are specific to long-distance carriers (except 1-700-555-4141, which identifies the carrier). Because of the unpredictable and potentially costly rate for such a call, these services never gained widespread use.
* Telemarketing fraud takes a number of forms; much like mail fraud, solicitations for the sale of goods or investments which are worthless or never delivered and requests for donations to unregistered charities are not uncommon. Callers often prey upon sick, disabled and elderly persons; scams in which a caller attempts to obtain banking or credit card information are also common. A variant involves calling a number of business offices, asking for model numbers of various pieces of office equipment in use (such as photocopiers), sending unsolicited shipments of supplies for the machines, and then billing the victims at inflated prices.

* Caller ID spoofing is a technique used with many frauds to impersonate a trusted caller such as a bank or credit union, a law enforcement agency, or another subscriber. When the telephone rings, the number displayed as caller is the faked trusted number. These calls may be used for vishing, where a scammer impersonates a trusted counterparty in order to fraudulently obtain financial or personal information.
* &quot;Call clearing delays,&quot; in some United Kingdom exchanges, could be abused to defraud. For many years only the caller could disconnect a call; if the called party hung up the call it would not be disconnected. A thief would call a household and impersonate, for example, a bank or the police, and encourage them to call back, using a trusted number known to the victim. The caller could then play a recording of dial tone to trick the victim into thinking they were making a new call, while actually remaining connected to the original call; someone impersonating a bank or police officer would then come on the line.

* Cordless phones had additional vulnerabilities; with some models a scanner radio could intercept analogue conversations in progress, or a handset of the same or a similar model as the target system may be usable to make toll calls through a cordless base station which does not authenticate calls. Obsolete analogue mobile telephones have stopped working in areas where the AMPS service has been shut down, but obsolete cordless phone systems may remain in service as long as analog telephony is supported.
* A scam involving Indian call centers targeting American or Canadian customers demanding &quot;unpaid taxes&quot; by impersonating government officials was reported in 2016. Similar government impersonation scams include the SSA impersonation scam.
* Every day, hundreds of scam calls are received on the US mainland which offer the recipients grant money from the Federal Government, but requesting a &quot;small administration fee&quot;, although there are no fees associated with applying for or receiving a government grant.
* During the 1980s, a common form of premium-rate fraud involved manipulating children (often through television commercials, such as during Saturday morning cartoons) to call a premium-rate number without their parents&#x27; knowledge or permission, sometimes going so far as to ask a child to hold the phone receiver up to the television set as it played DTMF tones to automatically trigger the dialing of a premium number. Such practices are now illegal in the United States.
* The Can You Hear Me? telephone scam was alleged to be used in North America in 2017: the caller would ask a question with the answer &quot;yes&quot;, then use a recording of the &quot;yes&quot; to make telephone transactions.
* SMS pumping is a form of fraud where attackers exploit the messaging systems of businesses to generate revenue by sending high volumes of messages to premium-rate phone numbers. To achieve this, fraudsters target vulnerabilities in SMS gateways or APIs used by businesses for customer communication (such as verification codes or notifications messages).

=== Fraud between phone companies ===
* Interconnect fraud involves the falsification of records by telephone carriers in order to deliberately miscalculate the money owed by one telephone network to another. This affects calls originating on one network but carried by another at some point between source and destination.
* Refiling is a form of interconnect fraud in which one carrier tampers with CID (caller-ID) or ANI data to falsify the number from which a call originated before handing the call off to a competitor. Refiling and interconnect fraud briefly made headlines in the aftermath of the Worldcom financial troubles; the refiling scheme is based on a quirk in the system by which telecommunications companies bill each othertwo calls to the same place may incur different costs because of differing displayed origin. A common calculation of payments between telecommunications companies calculates the percentage of the total distance over which each telecommunications company has carried one call to determine division of toll revenues for that call; refiling distorts data required to make these calculations.
* Grey routes are voice over IP gateways which deliver international calls to countries by mislabeling them as inbound local mobile telephone calls at destination. These &quot;SIM box&quot; operations are common in third world nations with exorbitant official international rates, usually due to some combination of tight control by one state-supported monopoly and/or excessive taxation of inbound overseas calls. Governments who believe themselves entitled to charge any arbitrary inflated price for inbound international calls, even far above the cost of domestic calls to the same destinations, will legislate against any privately owned, independent, competitive VoIP gateway, labeling the operations as &quot;bypass fraud&quot; and driving them underground or out of business. As a VoIP gateway in such a regulatory environment typically does not have access to T-carrier primary rate interface or PBX-style trunks, its operator is forced to rely on a hardware configuration with Internet telephony on one side and a large number of mobile SIM cards and handsets on the other to place the calls as if they were from individual local mobile subscribers.

=== Fraud against phone companies by users ===
* Subscription fraud: for example, signing up with a false name, or no intention to pay.
* Collect call fraud: most automated collect call systems allow the caller to record a short audio snippet, intended to identify the caller so that the recipient can decide whether or not to accept the charges. With the system being automated, the caller could insert any message they want, free of charge, as long as it fit within the short allotted time, and the recipient could refuse charges. A variant is to refuse a collect call at the higher operator-assisted rate, then call the person back at a lower price.
* Person-to-person call fraud: Under archaic operator assistance systems, a person-to-person call only charged a caller if they could reach a specific person at the other end of the line. Thus, if coordinated beforehand, a caller could use a false name as a code word, with the recipient rejecting the call, and no one would be charged.
* Intentional non-return of rental equipment (such as extension telephones) when relocating to a new address. The equipment would then be used at the new location without paying a monthly equipment rental fee. This has become rare as most telephones are now owned outright, not rented.

=== Frauds against phone companies by third parties ===
* Phreaking involves obtaining knowledge of how the telephone network operates, which can be (but is not always) used to place unauthorized calls. The history of phone phreaking shows that many &#x27;phreaks&#x27; used their vast knowledge of the network to help telephone companies. There are, however, many phreaks who use their knowledge to exploit the network for personal gain, even today. In some cases, social engineering has been used to trick telecommunications company employees into releasing technical information. Early examples of phreaking involved generation of various control tones, such as a 2600 hertz blue box tone to release a long-distance trunk for immediate re-use or the red box tones which simulate coins being inserted into a payphone. These exploits no longer work in many areas of the telephone network due to widespread use of digital switching systems and out-of-band signaling. There are, however, many areas of the world where these control tones are still used and this kind of fraud still continues to happen.
* A more high-tech version of the above is switch reprogramming, where unauthorized &quot;back door&quot; access to the phone company&#x27;s network or billing system is used to allow free telephony. This is then sometimes resold by the &#x27;crackers&#x27; to other customers.
* Caller name display (CNAM) is vulnerable to data mining, where a dishonest user obtains a line (fixed or mobile) with caller name display and then calls that number repeatedly from an autodialer which uses caller ID spoofing to send a different presentation number on each call. None of the calls are actually answered, but the telephone company has to look up every number (a CNAM database &quot;dip&quot;) to display the corresponding subscriber name from its records. The list of displayed names and numbers (which may be landline or wireless) is then sold to telemarketers.
* Payphones have also been misused to receive fraudulent collect calls; most carriers have turned off the feature of accepting incoming calls or have muted the payphones internal ringing mechanism for this very reason.
* Cloning has been used as a means of copying both the electronic serial number and the telephone number of another subscriber&#x27;s phone to a second (cloned) phone. Airtime charges for outbound calls are then mis-billed to the victim&#x27;s cellular phone account instead of the perpetrator&#x27;s.

<text>Imperial Oil Limited () is a Canadian petroleum company. It is Canada&#x27;s second-largest integrated oil company. It is majority-owned by American oil company ExxonMobil, with a 69.6% ownership stake in the company. It is a producer of crude oil, diluted bitumen, and natural gas. Imperial Oil is one of Canada&#x27;s major petroleum refiners and petrochemical producers. It supplies Esso-brand service stations.

Imperial owns 25% of Syncrude, which is one of the world&#x27;s largest oil sands operations. It also has holdings in the Alberta Oil Sands, and operates the Kearl Oil Sands mining operation with ExxonMobil.

Imperial Oil is headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. It was based in Toronto, Ontario, until 2005. Most of Imperial&#x27;s production is from its natural resource holdings in the Alberta oil sands and the Norman Wells oil field in the Northwest Territories.

Imperial Oil was ranked 34th in the Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI) for 2021 out of 120 mining, oil, and gas corporations that extract resources north of the Arctic Circle.

==History==
=== Founding and early years ===
In April 1880, Jacob Lewis Englehart and 16 prominent oil refiners in London, Ontario, and Petrolia, Ontario, formed Imperial Oil in response to Standard Oil&#x27;s growing dominance of the oil market. Englehart aimed to emulate John D. Rockefeller and merge the entire Canadian oil industry into one conglomerate. Although the majority of Ontario&#x27;s top oil producers agreed to join in the enterprise, exceptions included John Henry Fairbank, who was then Canada&#x27;s largest oil producer, and James Miller Williams, founder of the Canadian Oil Company. Englehart and the refiners established Imperial Oil as a joint-stock company with a capitalized value of $500,000. In addition to Englehart, the original shareholders included Frederick A. Fitzgerald, Isaac and Herman Waterman, William Spencer and his sons William and Charles, Thomas and Edward Hodgins, John Geary, Joseph Fallows, John Minhinnick, William English and John Walker. Together, the shareholders possessed twelve oil refineries and controlled 85% of the refining capacity in Canada. Fitzgerald and Englehart were the two largest stakeholders in the company and were named the president and vice president, respectively. Imperial Oil&#x27;s charter noted that its goal was to &quot;find, produce, refine and distribute petroleum and its products throughout Canada.&quot;

Despite its early successes, Imperial Oil struggled to make a profit and issue dividends in the early 1880s. The discovery of new oil fields in Pennsylvania and New York drove down the price of oil, and the creation of the Standard Oil Trust resulted in an increase of American oil imports into Canada. In a move to boost kerosene prices, Imperial closed down ten of the twelve refineries it had acquired through the merger, leaving only the Silver Star refinery in Petrolia and the Victor works in London. In 1883, the Victor works was struck by lightning and burned to the ground, and under Englehart&#x27;s direction, the company concentrated its refining efforts at Petrolia.

=== Herman Frasch and the sulphur dilemma ===
In 1884, Imperial Oil purchased the exclusive use of Herman Frasch&#x27;s fractional distillation patent, which was more efficient at separating crude oil into usable products. Imperial initially offered Frasch $10,000 and Imperial Oil stock, but he persuaded the company to offer him a salary that matched Fitzgerald&#x27;s and a seat on the Board of Directors. Frasch had taken the position primarily to supervise the installation of his refining method at the Silver Star refinery and resigned in February 1885 once the work was complete. Frasch then joined John Minhinnick in forming a separate venture called the Empire Oil Company. The pair purchased an idle refinery in London, and Frasch began experimenting on a way to remove the sulphur content in the oil pumped at Lambton County. The high sulphur content in Canadian oil placed it at a disadvantage compared to the oil mined at Pennsylvania due to its &quot;distinctive odour&quot; when burned. Canadians called the product &quot;skunk oil&quot;. Between 1885 and 1887, Frasch discovered that mixing copper oxide with the oil during the distilling process would remove the sulphur content and odour from the refined product.

By this time, Standard Oil had also become interested in the desulphurization process after moving production to oil fields in Ohio that had a similar sulphur content to Lambton County. In 1886, Standard Oil persuaded Frasch to return to the United States and join their company by offering &quot;a salary higher than that of any other scientist in the country&quot; and an exchange of his shares in the Empire Oil Company for an equivalent amount in Standard Oil. After returning to the United States, Frasch perfected his desulphurization strategy, and Standard Oil held a monopoly on the process until 1905.

=== The 1890s and the Standard Oil buyout ===

Despite rising revenue and growth in the 1890s, Imperial Oil faced continuing challenges in its markets, primarily from Standard Oil, which operated a series of subsidiary companies across Canada. Although Imperial dominated the Western Canadian market, the company could not establish a strong foothold in the Maritimes or Quebec as Standard supplied these regions through long-term contracts with local companies. While the Conservative Party&#x27;s National Policy had stopped Standard Oil from fully entering the Canadian market, the economic policy came under attack by Standard Oil lobbyists and Canadian consumers, who asked for a cheaper and higher quality product. In 1893, Ottawa reduced import duties on refined oil products from 7.2 cents to 6 cents per wine gallon, and in 1896, Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s government reduced the tariff again to 5 cents. Additionally, Laurier removed restrictions on tank cars and tank steamers, allowing foreign companies to bulk ship oil into Canada by rail or sea. Before, foreign companies had to repackage their product into oil barrels before entering Canada, adding roughly five cents in shipping and handling charges to each gallon of imported oil.

In 1895, Imperial Oil&#x27;s Board of Directors began negotiations to sell the company to the Colonial Development Corporation, a British company. After three years, the deal collapsed, and the Board of Directors instead chose to sell the company to Standard Oil. The agreement specified that Standard Oil would acquire 75% of Imperial Oil&#x27;s shares, Imperial Oil would acquire all of Standard Oil&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary companies, Imperial&#x27;s capitalization would be increased to $1 million, and Imperial shareholders would receive a dividend of $93,000. Following the deal, Imperial Oil shut down the Silver Star refinery in Petrolia and moved its refining operations to Sarnia, Ontario.

=== Later years ===

In a landmark 1911 anti-trust case, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Standard Oil to break up into 34 separate companies. Ownership of Imperial Oil, as well Standard Oil&#x27;s other subsidiaries outside the U.S., were all transferred to only one of those 34 successor firms, Jersey Standard (later renamed Exxon).

Imperial Oil discovered the Leduc Woodbend Devonian oil reef in 1947, marking the beginning of the contemporary period in Canadian oil and gas development. Drilling began on the landmark discovery well Leduc No. 1 on November 20, 1946.

In 1989, Imperial Oil acquired Texaco&#x27;s Canadian operations.

When Exxon and Mobil merged in 1999 to form ExxonMobil, the combined company continued to maintain Mobil&#x27;s Canadian operations as a separate subsidiary, independent of Imperial Oil.

===Film and television===
From the 1934-35 season through the 1975-76 season, Imperial Oil was a sponsor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; for both radio and television broadcasts.
Esso, which had three stars on their signs, sponsored &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;&#x27;s three stars of the game.

In the same era, the company was also involved in film production, providing funding for independent documentary films. Glenbow Museum in Calgary holds a large collection of Imperial Oil&#x27;s film inventory.

== Retail ==

Imperial Oil supplied more than 2,000 service stations as of October 2020, all of which were owned by third parties. It sold its remaining 497 stations in 2016 to retailers such as Alimentation Couche-Tard (mostly Ontario and Quebec), 7-Eleven (mostly Alberta and British Columbia), Parkland, Harnois (Quebec) and Wilson Fuel (Atlantic Canada). In the late early 1990s Imperial Oil had acquired retail operations from Texaco&#x27;s Canadian unit Texaco Canada Incorporated.

With ExxonMobil having majority ownership, Imperial Oil licences its parent company&#x27;s brands, including the Esso and Mobil names for service stations, and the Speedpass electronic payment system.

Until 2018, Imperial Oil was a member of the rewards program Aeroplan. On March 13, 2018, Loblaw Companies announced that it had reached a deal for the Esso-branded stations to join the PC Optimum rewards program, beginning on June 1, 2018. Loblaw Companies had sold its network of 213 gas stations (all of which are attached to its various grocery store locations) to Brookfield Business Partners in 2017; Brookfield entered into an agreement with Imperial Oil to use the Mobil brand for these stations. As part of the sale agreement, these stations also continue to participate in PC Optimum.

<text>Irad (, &quot;Irad&quot;) is a name in Hebrew. In the Book of Genesis, the grandson of Cain is Irad.

Genesis 4:18, in a genealogical passage about the descendants of Cain, contains the only reference to Irad in the Bible: &quot;To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech&quot; (&quot;New Revised Standard Version&quot;).

The lineage of Cain in Genesis 4:17-22 closely parallels the lineage of Cain&#x27;s brother Seth found in Genesis 5:1-32. In terms of the Documentary hypothesis, the genealogy of Cain is attributed to the Jahwist source, while the genealogy of Seth is attributed to the Priestly source. The J list and P list contain seven pairs of similar names, and the &quot;Irad&quot; of the Jahwist source is parallel to the &quot;Jared&quot; of the Priestly source.

<doc id="657305" wikidata="Q712768" url="?curid=657305" title="Wang Meng (Former Qin)">
<text>Wang Meng (; 325 – August or September 375), courtesy name Jinglüe (景略), formally Marquess Wu of Qinghe (清河武侯), was a Chinese military general and politician. He served as a chancellor of the Former Qin dynasty of China and under the Emperor Xuanzhao in the fourth century AD. Under his governance, the Former Qin expanded from encompassing only most of Shaanxi, eastern Gansu, and extreme western Shanxi and Henan, to covering nearly all of then-Chinese territory north of the Huai River and the southwest. He is commonly regarded as one of the greatest statesmen in Chinese history. Wang Meng is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.

== Early life ==
Wang Meng was poor in his youth when he lived in the Later Zhao capital Yecheng, and he made a living by making bamboo grain containers for threshing. Despite his intelligence, his talents were not discovered by Later Zhao officials. The intelligentsia also largely refused to associate with him, since he was unkempt in his appearance. He later became a hermit at Huayin Mountain, in the territory of Former Qin, ruled by the Fu clan of Di ethnicity, after Later Zhao&#x27;s collapse.

When the Jin general Huan Wen made a major attack on Former Qin in 354 and reached all the way to Ba River (灞水), in the vicinity of Former Qin&#x27;s capital Chang&#x27;an, Wang went to meet Huan. Wang, as unkempt as he was, was using his hand to slap at fleas and ticks during the conversation, but impressed Huan with his knowledge and tactics. Huan then asked him why the people of the Qin lands were not shifting their allegiance to Jin, and Wang pointed out that the people were not sure what Huan&#x27;s intentions were, given that he hesitated at crossing the Ba River. As the situation stalemated, Huan began to run out of food supplies and was forced to withdraw. He invited Wang to withdraw with him, but Wang declined, apparently believing that Huan was not the right person to follow.

After Fu Sheng, the son of Former Qin founding emperor Fu Jiàn, became emperor in 355, he ruled the empire with stern cruelty and arbitrariness, slaughtering officials and nobles at will. His cousin Fu Jiān (note different tone) the Prince of Donghai feared that he would be the next target, and secretly plotted with a number of people. At Lü Polou (呂婆樓)&#x27;s suggestion, Fu Jiān met Wang, and they became friends immediately, and Fu Jiān compared their meeting to Liu Bei&#x27;s meeting of Zhuge Liang.

In 357, after finding out that Fu Sheng was ready to kill him and his brother Fu Fa (苻法) the Prince of Qinghe, Fu Jiān acted preemptively, overthrowing and killing Fu Sheng. He assumed the throne under the title &quot;Heavenly Prince&quot; (&quot;Tian Wang&quot;), and he made Wang one of his key advisors, along with his brothers Fu Fa and Fu Rong, his son Fu Pi, and his mother Empress Dowager Gou&#x27;s lover Li Wei (李威).

== Early career ==
Under Li&#x27;s suggestion, however, Fu Jiān increasingly entrusted greater and greater responsibility to Wang, and Wang handled the responsibility capably. When he got into a conflict of words with the general Fan Shi (樊世), angering Fan so much that Fan physically attacked him, Fu put Fan to death. Wang was named the mayor of Chang&#x27;an in 359, and quickly arrested and executed the founding emperor Fu Jiàn&#x27;s brother-in-law Qiang De (強德), who had previously robbed the people of possessions and children unpunished. Quickly, the noble families curbed their behavior, and social order was well established, in Chang&#x27;an. Late that year, Fu Jiān promoted him to prime minister, despite his initial refusal and recommendation of Fu Rong for that post.

Wang Meng, as prime minister, organized the Former Qin government into a model of efficiency and honesty—sometimes to the degree of ruthlessness. In 364, for example, after Fu Sheng&#x27;s brother Fu Teng (苻騰) the Duke of Ru&#x27;nan rebelled and was executed, Wang suggested to Fu Jiān that Fu Sheng&#x27;s four remaining brothers be killed as well, a suggestion that Fu Jiān rejected. Wang also showed military talent, in addition to talent in governance. In 366, for example, Fu Jiān sent him, Yang An, and Yao Chang to make a successful raid against Jin&#x27;s Jing Province (荊州, modern central and southern Hubei). In 367, Wang also led an army against the warlords Lian Qi (斂岐) and Li Yan (李儼), who occupied modern eastern Gansu and who had vacillated between Former Qin and Former Liang. At that time, however, Wang avoided a direct confrontation with Former Liang&#x27;s ruler Zhang Tianxi, as he negotiated a compromise in dividing Li&#x27;s territory and followers.

In late 367, Fu Sheng&#x27;s remaining brothers—Fu Liu (苻柳) the Duke of Jin, Fu Sou (苻廋) the Duke of Wei, and Fu Wu (苻武) the Duke of Yan, along with Fu Jiān&#x27;s brother Fu Shuang (苻雙) the Duke of Zhao, rebelled. Fu Jiān sent separate forces against each of the rebellious dukes, and Wang was sent to attack Fu Liu, whom he defeated easily. Wang then turned his attention against Fu Sou, and eventually, all four dukes were defeated and killed.

In 369, when Huan Wen launched a major attack against Former Yan, the Former Yan emperor Murong Wei and regent Murong Ping panicked and sought assistance from Former Qin, promising to cede the Luoyang region to Former Qin if it rendered assistance. Most Former Qin officials suggested a refusal, but Wang reminded Fu Jiān that if Huan conquered Former Yan and added its territory to Jin&#x27;s, Former Qin would not be able to stand. Fu Jiān therefore sent a force commanded by Shi Yue (石越) to relieve Former Yan, whose general Murong Chui defeated Huan, with Shi&#x27;s assistance. However, Former Yan refused to cede Luoyang, and Fu Jiān commissioned Wang to lead a 60,000-men force against Former Yan later that year. Wang&#x27;s campaign seemed even more promising after Murong Chui, fearful of Murong Ping&#x27;s jealousy and the emperor Murong Wei&#x27;s mother Empress Dowager Kezuhun&#x27;s hatred toward him, defected to Former Qin. Fu Jiān greeted Murong Chui with great honors, but Wang distrusted Murong Chui.

In early 370, Wang attacked Luoyang, forcing its surrender. He then carried out a plot to try to put Murong Chui to death—as he bribed one of Murong Chui&#x27;s guards Jin Xi (金熙) into giving Murong Chui&#x27;s heir apparent Murong Ling (慕容令), who was serving as Wang&#x27;s guide, a false message that Murong Chui had heard that Empress Dowager Kezuhun had regretted her actions and that, therefore, he was defecting back to Former Yan. Murong Ling, unable to verify either the truth or the falsehood of the message, decided to defect back to Former Yan. Wang immediately accused Murong Ling of treason, and Murong Chui, in fear, fled, but was captured, although Fu Jiān believed that Murong Ling was acting independently and therefore pardoned Murong Chui. (Historians such as Sima Guang, the author of &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, and Bo Yang, have criticized Wang as driven by jealousy of how honored Murong Chui was by Fu Jiān, although this point is disputed by other historians.)

Wang continued his campaign against Former Yan, and he advanced on Hu Pass (壺關, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), defeating all Former Yan resistance on the way. He then captured Jinyang (晉陽, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Murong Ping led a 300,000-men strong force against Wang, but apprehensive of Wang, he stopped at Lu River (潞川, in modern Changzhi as well). Wang soon arrived to prepare to face off against him. Meanwhile, Murong Ping made the worst display of his corruption at this time—keeping guards at forests and streams, disallowing commoners and even his own soldiers from cutting firewood or fishing unless they paid a usage fee in either money or silk. He soon had a stash of wealth, but completely lost the morale of his soldiers. Murong Wei, hearing this, sent a messenger to rebuke him and ordering him to distribute the wealth to the soldiers, but the damage was done. In winter 370, the armies engaged, and despite the numerical advantage that Murong Ping had, Wang crushed him, and Murong Ping fled back to the Former Yan capital Yecheng by himself. Murong Wei abandoned Yecheng and tried to flee to the old capital Helong (和龍, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning), but was captured on the way. Fu Jiān pardoned him but had him formally surrender with his officials, ending Former Yan.

== Late career ==
Fu Jiān made Wang Meng the viceroy over six provinces—the former territory of Former Yan. In those six provinces, Wang had full imperial authority, an authority that Wang tried to decline repeatedly, but eventually exercised. In 371, he wrote to Zhang Tianxi and persuaded him to submit to Former Qin authority as a vassal. Later that year, he again tried to decline the responsibilities of viceroy over six provinces, and offered to govern just one province. Fu Jiān refused.

In 372, Fu Jiān summoned Wang back to Chang&#x27;an to again be prime minister. Fu Rong succeeded him as viceroy over the six provinces. It was described that during this time, Wang was so capable that Fu Jiān barely had to carry out any duties of his own. Sima Guang had this description of Wang&#x27;s abilities:

:&quot;Wang was strong in personality and understanding, honest and resolute, clean and solemn, and he understood right and wrong very well. He deposed incompetent officials and promoted the talented people who were hidden in the lower ranks due to their lack of connections. He supervised the people to tend their fields, plant mulberries, and keep silkworms, in addition to strengthening the battle training of the troops. Each official was competent in tasks that he was given. Each penalty fit the evidence of the crime. Therefore, the empire became rich and powerful and undefeatable. It was during this time that Former Qin was a most well-run state.&quot;

In summer 375, Wang grew ill. In order to try to appease the spirits to save Wang&#x27;s life, Fu Jiān ordered a general pardon. However, by autumn, Wang was near death. On his deathbed, he warned Fu Jiān against campaigns to conquer Eastern Jin, and stated that he believed that the Xianbei (the people of Former Yan&#x27;s nobility) and the Qiang would create trouble in the future and should be watched against. He then died. However, Fu Jiãn failed to take in this last advice, and launched a major offensive against Eastern Jin in the autumn of 383, but was badly defeated at the Battle of Fei River in winter that year, severely weakening Former Qin and eventually led to its collapse in 394.

Wang Meng&#x27;s sons Wang Yong (王永) and Wang Pi (王皮) would serve as Former Qin officials, and Wang Yong would eventually be prime minister during the reign of Fu Pi, but was unable to reverse Former Qin&#x27;s collapse at that time. One of Wang Meng&#x27;s grandsons, Wang Zhen&#x27;e (王鎮惡), would later be a Jin general under Liu Yu.

<text>Michie Stadium is an outdoor football stadium on the campus of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. The home field for the Army Black Knights, it opened in 1924 and has a seating capacity of 30,000 for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.

The stadium sits at the upper portion of campus, directly west of Lusk Reservoir. The field is at an elevation of above sea level and runs in the traditional north–south configuration, with the press box above the west sideline. Due to the view offered by its location overlooking the Hudson River and the Neo-Gothic architecture of the campus below, it was rated as &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s #3 sports venue of the 20th century.

==Overview==

Michie Stadium is dedicated to the memory of Dennis Michie (1870–1898), who was instrumental in starting the football program while a cadet at the Academy. A member of the Class of 1892, Michie organized, managed, and coached the first football team at West Point in 1890. Six years after graduation, he was killed in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. There have been several renovations since the stadium&#x27;s first game in October 1924, when Army defeated Saint Louis, 17–0.

In 1999, the football field at Michie Stadium was named &quot;Blaik Field&quot; on September 25, in honor of Earl &quot;Red&quot; Blaik, West Point&#x27;s all-time leader in wins during a 17-year tenure from 1941 to 1958. Blaik led Army to three consecutive national titles from 1944 to 1946.

Since 2008, the playing surface has been FieldTurf. This replaced AstroPlay, which had been used since 2001. The stadium&#x27;s playing field was natural grass until AstroTurf was installed in 1977.

Michie Stadium first hosted the Army–Navy Game in 1943 during World War II, after it was played at Thompson Stadium at Annapolis the year before. Neither Army nor Navy had played at an on-campus facility since very early in the rivalry, since teams&#x27; home stadiums are not nearly large enough to accommodate the crowds and media that usually attend the rivalry games. Their rivalry game is normally played at a neutral site between the campuses on the East Coast, usually in Philadelphia in early December. In 2020, the Army–Navy Game was moved from Philadelphia to Michie Stadium due to state-imposed attendance limits on outdoor events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Construction on the Michie Stadium Preservation Project began on April 15, 2024. The project aimed to replace the eastern stands and all amenities, including walkways, bathrooms, and concessions. The stadium&#x27;s capacity is capped at 30,000 during construction. The new eastern stands were scheduled to be ready just before the 2026 football season, and were intended to increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 36,000.

<text>Anzû, also known as dZû and Imdugud (Sumerian: &quot;&quot;), is a monster in several Mesopotamian religions. He was conceived by the pure waters of the Abzu and the wide Earth, or as son of Siris. Anzû was depicted as a massive bird who can breathe fire and water, although Anzû is alternately depicted as a lion-headed eagle.

Stephanie Dalley, in &quot;Myths from Mesopotamia&quot;, writes that &quot;the &quot;Epic of Anzu&quot; is principally known in two versions: an Old Babylonian version of the early second millennium [BC], giving the hero as Ningirsu; and &#x27;The Standard Babylonian&#x27; version, dating to the first millennium BC, which appears to be the most quoted version, with the hero as Ninurta&quot;. However, the Anzu character does not appear as often in some other writings, as noted below.

==Name==

The name of the mythological being usually called Anzû was actually written in the oldest Sumerian cuneiform texts as (; in context, the cuneiform sign , or , is an ideogram for &quot;bird&quot;). In texts of the Old Babylonian period, the name is more often found as . In 1961, Landsberger argued that this name should be read as &quot;Anzu&quot;, and most researchers have followed suit. In 1989, Thorkild Jacobsen noted that the original reading of the cuneiform signs as written (giving the name &quot;&quot;) is also valid, and was probably the original pronunciation of the name, with Anzu derived from an early phonetic variant. Similar phonetic changes happened to parallel terms, such as (meaning &quot;heavy wind&quot;) becoming . Changes like these occurred by evolution of the &quot;im&quot; to &quot;an&quot; (a common phonetic change) and the blending of the new &quot;n&quot; with the following &quot;d&quot;, which was aspirated as &quot;dh&quot;, a sound which was borrowed into Akkadian as &quot;z&quot; or &quot;s&quot;.

It has also been argued based on contextual evidence and transliterations on cuneiform learning tablets, that the earliest, Sumerian form of the name was at least sometimes also pronounced Zu, and that Anzu is primarily the Akkadian form of the name. However, there is evidence for both readings of the name in both languages, and the issue is confused further by the fact that the prefix () was often used to distinguish deities or even simply high places. could therefore mean simply &quot;heavenly eagle&quot;.

==Origin and cultural evolution==
Thorkild Jacobsen proposed that Anzu was an early form of the god Abu, who was also syncretized by the ancients with Ninurta/Ningirsu, a god associated with thunderstorms. Abu was referred to as &quot;Father Pasture&quot;, illustrating the connection between rainstorms and the fields growing in Spring. According to Jacobsen, this god was originally envisioned as a huge black thundercloud in the shape of an eagle, and was later depicted with a lion&#x27;s head to connect it to the roar of thunder. Some depictions of Anzu therefore depict the god alongside goats (which, like thunderclouds, were associated with mountains in the ancient Near East) and leafy boughs. The connection between Anzu and Abu is further reinforced by a statue found in the Tell Asmar Hoard depicting a human figure with large eyes, with an Anzu bird carved on the base. It is likely that this depicts Anzu in his symbolic or earthly form as the Anzu-bird, and in his higher, human-like divine form as Abu. Though some scholars have proposed that the statue actually represents a human worshiper of Anzu, others have pointed out that it does not fit the usual depiction of Sumerian worshipers, but instead matches similar statues of gods in human form with their more abstract form or their symbols carved onto the base.

==Sumerian and Akkadian myth==
In Sumerian and Akkadian mythology, Anzû is a divine storm-bird and the personification of the southern wind and the thunder clouds. This demon—half man and half bird—stole the &quot;Tablet of Destinies&quot; from Enlil and hid them on a mountaintop. Anu ordered the other gods to retrieve the tablet, even though they all feared the demon. According to one text, Marduk killed the bird; in another, it died through the arrows of the god Ninurta.

Anzu also appears in the story of &quot;Inanna and the Huluppu Tree&quot;, which is recorded in the preamble to the Sumerian epic poem &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot;.

Anzu appears in the Sumerian Lugalbanda and the Anzud Bird (also called: The Return of Lugalbanda).

==Babylonian and Assyrian myth==

The shorter Old Babylonian version was found at Susa. Full version in &quot;Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, The Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others&quot; by Stephanie Dalley, page 222 and at &quot;The Epic of Anzû&quot;, Old Babylonian version from Susa, Tablet II, lines 1-83, read by Claus Wilcke. 
The longer Late Assyrian version from Nineveh is most commonly called &quot;The Myth of Anzu&quot;. (Full version in Dalley, page 205). An edited version is at &quot;Myth of Anzu&quot;. Latest editions of the Old Babylonian, Standard Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian (Late Assyrian) versions of the myth are published in the electronic Babylonian Library.

In the novels, anzu have a symbiotic relationship with vampires, helping them control their unstable emotions as well as saving masters from killing vampire scions who fail to emerge from a feral state after being turned. In addition to being vampire Master of the City Leo Pellosier&#x27;s &quot;Mercy Blade,&quot; DiMercy serves as the Executioner for the Master of the City.

<text>Heavy Weather is the seventh album by Weather Report, released in 1977 through Columbia Records. By 1991, the release had sold 1,000,000 copies in the US alone; it would prove to be the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album and one of the best sellers in the Columbia jazz catalog. &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine gave &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; a five-star review, and later its readers voted it jazz album of the year.

The lineup for the album consisted of Weather Report founders Joe Zawinul (keyboards, synthesizers) and Wayne Shorter (saxophone), alongside Jaco Pastorius (bass), Alex Acuña (drums), and Manolo Badrena (percussion). It was produced and orchestrated by Zawinul, with additional production by Shorter and Pastorius, and engineered by Ron Malo.

The album opens with &quot;Birdland&quot;, which on its own became a significant commercial success, unusual for an instrumental composition, and would go on to become a jazz standard. The melody had been performed live by the band as part of &quot;Dr Honoris Causa&quot;, which was from Joe Zawinul&#x27;s eponymous solo album. &quot;Teen Town&quot;, a Pastorius composition where his bass takes the lead instrument role, is often considered a highlight of the album and of Pastorius&#x27;s career. &quot;Rumba Mamá&quot;, a percussion and vocal feature for Manolo Badrena and Alex Acuña, was recorded live at a summer 1976 concert in Montreux, Switzerland, which was also the subject of a DVD released in 2007.

==Critical reception==

Dan Oppenheimer said in a June 1977 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he felt the band had moved away from their earlier music, losing a lot of the space, melodies and airy feel that set them apart from other jazz-rock bands, but gaining a new bassist who &quot;has been instrumental in developing their busier, talkative style&quot;, and that while their music previously &quot;went up and up only, becoming more ethereal as it went, the new bottom makes all the difference in the world&quot;.

===Legacy===

Richard Ginell commented in a retrospective review for AllMusic that it was released &quot;just as the jazz-rock movement began to run out of steam&quot;; however, he felt that &quot;this landmark album proved that there was plenty of creative life left in the idiom.&quot;

In February 2011, &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2000, it was voted #822 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums, citing the interplay between Jaco Pastorius and Joe Zawinul.

<doc id="657323" wikidata="Q760153" url="?curid=657323" title="Bharuch">
<text>Bharuch (), formerly known as Bharutkutccha, is a city at the mouth of the river Narmada in Gujarat in western India. Bharuch is the administrative headquarters of Bharuch District.

The city of Bharuch and surroundings have been settled since times of antiquity. It was a ship building centre and sea port in the pre-compass coastal trading routes for trading with the Occident and the East, perhaps as far back as the days of earliest trade connections. The route made use of the regular and predictable monsoon winds or galleys. Many goods from the Far East and Far West (the famed Spices and Silk trade) were shipped there during the annual monsoon winds, making it a terminus for several key land-sea trade routes. Bharuch was known to the Greeks, the Parthian Empire, in the Roman Empire, the Chinese, and in other Western and Eastern centres of civilisation through the end of the European Middle Ages and other the middle ages of the world.

Bharuch has been the home to the Gujarati Bhargava Brahmana community for ages. The community traces its lineage to Bhrigu and Parashurama, who is the sixth avatara of Vishnu. The Bharava community still administers a large number of public trusts in the city. However the present day Bhargava Brahmanas have migrated to Mumbai, Surat, Vadodara, Ahmedabad and other countries such as France, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

Being close to one of the biggest industrial areas including Ankleshvara GIDC, it is at times referred to as the chemical capital of India. The city has chemical plants, textile mills, long staple cotton, dairy products and much more. Gujarat&#x27;s biggest liquid cargo terminal is situated 50 km to the west of Bharuch, in Dahej. It also houses many multinational companies, such as Videocon, BASF, ONGC Petro-Additions, Reliance Industries, Adani Ports &amp; SEZ, Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers &amp; Chemicals, MRF Tires, Yokohama Off-Highway Tires, Jubilant, Aditya Birla Hindalco Industries, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited, ISGEC Hitachi, UPL (company), Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Limited, Deepak Nitrite, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Petronet LNG, Godrej &amp; Boyce, Piramal Group, Pidilite Industries, SRF Limited, Safari Equipments and Welspun Maxsteel Ltd. The industrial estate of Vilayata houses the companies of Aditya Birla Grasim, Kansai Nerolac Paints etc., Jhagadia houses DCM Sriram Chemicals, Saint-Gobain India Ltd., PepsiCo India Holdings Ltd. among others. Because of the distinctive colour of its soil (which is also ideal for cotton cultivation), Bharuch is sometimes referred to as &#x27;Kanam Pradesham&#x27; (black-soil land). Bharuch is also nicknamed as &#x27;Peanut City&#x27; for its salty peanuts, locally known as &#x27;Khari Singh&#x27;.

==Etymology==
Bharuch was known as in ancient times.

It was known as Barygaza () (meaning &quot;deep-treasure&quot;), Bargosa etc. for the Greek, and later the Romans adopted the Greek name of this port in Latin as Barigaza in the Latin name of this city.

It was known as &#x27;Bharuch&#x27; under Muslim times, &#x27;Bharutkatchha&#x27; under Maratha times, and as &#x27;Bharucha&#x27; under European times.

==Mythology==

===Hindu mythology===

According to the Skanda Purana, when Bhrigu Rishi came here, Bharuch was the residence of the Goddess Lakshmi.

Bharuch derives its name from the great sage Bhrigu. The original name of Bharuch is &#x27;Bhrigukachchha&#x27;. Bhrigu was one of the many children of Brahma and Sarasvati. There is also a story which indicates that Bhrigu along with his kin asked for temporary access to Bharuch which then belonged to Lakshmi since Bharuch is located on the banks of river Narmada also known as Rudra Deha. Chandramaulishvara Shiva is the Kuladevata of Bhargavas of Bharuch. Bhrigu never left the place and the Ashrama of Brighu Rishi is located on the banks of Narmada.

Bharuch was considered to be sacred among sages, and they would come to Bharuch to pray. The priests of Bharuch were famous for their learning in the other regions too. As per the mythological stories, Agnihotri and Samvedi – the learned priests of Bharuch – were famous up to Kashi in the northern Indian Subcontinent and the whole Indian Subcontinent.

Sages like Shukra, Chyavana, Markendeya and Jamadagni were from the lineage of Bhrigu. Parshurama (sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu) was born in the seventh generation of Bhrigu.

According to the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, there are 55 tirthas located in Bharuch. Many great sages, such as Kashyapa, Kapila, Mandavya, Adi Sankaracharya, have performed penances in Bharuch.

Bharuch finds its mention in major Hindu scriptures, such as &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, &quot;Kurma Purana&quot;, &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, Ramayana, &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; and many more other Hindu Scriptures.

The Narmada is one of the Seven Holy Rivers of Hindu Indian Subcontinent; the other six being the Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Sindhu, Godavari and Kaveri and many more other rivers. It is known and said that a dip in any of these seven rivers and other rivers washes away one&#x27;s sins. According to a legend, the river Ganga is polluted by millions of people bathing in it. To cleanse herself, Ganga acquires the form of a black cow and comes to the Narmada to bath in its holy waters. Legends also mention that the Narmada River is older than the river Ganga.

===Mahanubhava Pantha===

Bharuch is the Birthplace (Incarnation) of Sarvadnya Sri Chakradhara Svami who is, for some Hindus, the Mortal Incarnation of Vishnu. He established Mahanubhava Pantha (also known as Jai Sri Krishnyi Pantha) in Maharashtra in 1267. Bhagavan Sri Chakradhara Svami propagated a religious movement, as well as social movement, in which all members were accepted irrespective of their castes, and the traditional ritualistic religions was rejected.

===Jain mythology===

Bharuch is also a sacred tirtha for Jains.

This tirtha is situated in the Bharuch city on the rail and road path, in the Shrimali Pole. Here we see the idol of Munisuvrata Svami; black in complexion and in Padmasana posture. In the history of the Jains, this ancient city is important from many points of view. Guru Gautama Svami eulogised Muni Suvrata Svami, who is installed in Bharuch, in his &quot;Jagachintamani Stotra&quot; composed on the eight tirthas, Bhagavan Muni Suvrata Svami gave sermons to a horse here.

Further, many prominent Acharyas built temples and composed works in this tirtha. In Bharuch, we are shown the Ashvavabodha tirtha of the times of Muni Suvrata Svami, Shakunika Vihara of Princess Sudarshana of Sri Lanka and also the Vihara which was ceremoniously raised by Acharya Hemchandra in which Kumarapala has waved Arati; is now a mosque.

In the opinion of Hindutvadi archaeologists, the Jama Masjid of the present Bharuch is &quot;probably&quot; this ancient temple. Some &quot;believe&quot; that in times of such invasions, the idol of Sri Prabhu was kept at a safe spot, and, as time passed, new temples were constructed and the old idols were installed. Today the idol is found in the new temple. There are here eleven other temples besides this.

===Buddhist mythology===

Bharuch is mentioned in various Buddhist Jatakas. It was an important Buddhist centre in the 7th century and is considered to be sacred among sages.

==History==

Bharuch is the oldest city of Gujarat. It is also the second-oldest city of India, having displayed evidence of continuous habitation, the first being Kashi (Varanasi). Chandragupta Vikramaditya and other rulers of the Gupta dynasty ruled this city up to the 5th century CE; it was then ruled over by the kings of the Gurjara tribe until the 7th century CE. The time period of 8th century CE to 13th century CE was said to be an important and very well-known part under the rule of Rajput rulers. Solanki dynasty&#x27;s ruler Siddharaja Jaisingha had built up Kota (fortification) and Darvaja (doors) around the whole of Bharuch. The fort has a number of gates, which were later named &#x27;Malbari Darvaja&#x27;, &#x27;Katopor Darvaja&#x27; and &#x27;Zadeshvari Darvaja&#x27;. In the first half of the 16th century, Bharuch was ruled over by Changez Khan. Then, the Mughal Emperor Humayun conquered and took over Bharuch as Mughal territory in 1534 CE.

===BCE era===

By the 6th century BCE, the city was readily accessible to outside trade via land-sea routes reaching the Levant to the Arab and Ethiopian traders feeding goods westwards to the Egyptians, Greeks, Parthians, Western Romans, Carthaginians, and eventually, the Eastern Roman Empires, and the Republic of Venice. It is likely even the Phoenicians knew of it; it has acted since antiquity as a link port to the luxury goods trade from the Far East and the interior of the Indian sub-continent to the civilisations of South-west Asia, the Middle-East, the Mediterranean basin including Northern Africa and Europe.

During the Prarga–Maurya period in Gujarat, King Pradyota Mahavira of the Pradyota dynasty of Ujjain ruled over Bharutkutchha in 550 BCE. He was a contemporary of Gautama Buddha. The &quot;Theragatha&quot;, part of the &quot;Pali Canon&quot; written down in Sri Lanka in the 1st century BCE, mentions Vaddha Thera and Malitavamba Thera of Bharukaccha, as contemporaries of the Buddha, while the Therigatha of the same canon mentions Vaddhamta Theri of Bharukaccha. The ancient Sri Lankan chronicle, the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;, mentions that the legendary king Vijaya stopped at Bharutkutchha for three months in 500 BCE.

Excavations near the banks of the river Narmada in Bharuch have revealed many archaeological and architectural wonders, mostly temples. Later Bharuch was part of the Mauryan Empire (322 BCE–185 BCE), the Western Satraps, the Guptas and the Gurjara-Pratiharas.

The Maurya period was between 322 BCE and 185 BCE. The post-Maurya period is mentioned between 185 BCE and 23 CE. The Princess of Sri Lanka, Sudarshana had built the Shakunika Vihara in the Bharuch during the rule of Samprati (229 BCE–220 BCE), and a Bharuch trader became responsible for the memories of the princess. This depicts trade relations between Lata (South Gujarat) and Sri Lanka.

It was known to the Greeks and Romans as &quot;Barygaza&quot;, and had a settlement of Greek and Roman traders. As one southern terminus of the Kamboja-Dvaravati Route, it is mentioned extensively as a major trading partner of the Roman and Greek worlds, in the 1st century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. One of the Periploi describes numerous Greek buildings and fortifications in the area, although mistakenly attributing them to early Greeks who never reached this far south in the Indian Subcontinent as they ruled only lands to the west of the Indian Subcontinent before the Indo-Greeks ruled the western and northern Indian Subcontinent along with the Indian Subcontinental countries, as well as the circulation of Indo-Greek coinage in the region:
:&quot;The metropolis of this country is Minnagara, from which much cotton cloth is brought down to Barygaza. In these places there remain even to the present time signs of the visit of Greeks, such as ancient shrines, walls of forts and great wells.&quot; Periplus, Chapter. 41
:&quot;To the present day ancient Drachmae are current in Barygaza, coming from this country, bearing inscriptions in Greek letters, and the devices of those who reigned after Alexander III of Macedonia, Apollodotus I and Menander I.&quot; Periplus Chapter. 47

===Kshatrapa era (23 CE–400 CE)===
In the 1st century AD, kings of Shaka community established their rule in Gujarat. Nahapana, the king of Bharutakutchha was very prosperous. During the Kshatrapa era, Bharuch port was very prosperous. It was a gateway of trading through land and waters both routes. Like other ancient ports, trading of all commodities also took place at the Bharuch port.

During the decade of 70 CE–80 CE, coins of Greek writing were used in Bharuch. The activity region of Jain priest Arya Khapoota (1st century AD) was in the Aatapata region of Bharuch. He had released the Ashvabodha pilgrims in Bharuch out of the control of the Buddhists.

Seven caves have been discovered from Kadiyadungar near Jajhapura, near Ankleshvara, of the Bharuch district. These caves are known as the Buddhist Viharas. It is believed that they were sculpted in the 1st century CE and 2nd century CE.

===Gupta era (415 CE–470 CE)===
During this time kings and queens of Trekutaka dynasty ruled the north of the Konkan and south of the Lata. Trekutaka ruled over the Surat district but the border of their state could not be decided. In the lines of Daspur of the weavers of Lata (South Gujarat) it has been mentioned that the Surya and Sanjana Temple was built in 437 CE at Bharuch.

=== Maitraka era (470 CE–788 CE) and Rashtrakuta era (788 CE–942 CE) ===
According to historical accounts, the Pratihara Empire with the capital at Bhinmal (or Srimal) was established by the Prathiharas. The kingdom of Bharuch was created by this Empire.

It is known that in 540 CE which dynasty ruled over the Bharuch state in 540 CE, a Mahasamanta named Sangramasingha ruled over Bharuch, But nothing is known about the king. Chinese traveller Xuanzang crossed Narmada river in 640 CE and recorded that Bharutakutchha (Po Lu Ka Che Po) had around 10 Buddhist monasteries with around 300 monks. After this period, in 648 CE, the Rashuddin Caliph Uthman had tried to attack Bharuch but the Maitraka forces killed all the Arab forces and won over them. In 648 AD, King Dhanasena –the fourth king of Vallabhi had put his winning camp in Bharuch with his forces after killing off all Arab forces and defeating them with fully ruling the Maitraka. A Muslim traveller Al–Biladuri had written in his notes about this in 713 CE – 714 CE.

The Arab Muslim ruler of Sindhu, Husam bin Amru came to Gandhara port by boat with his forces, trying to attack Bharuch. He and his forces tried to destroy the Hindu deities&#x27;s idols and the Hindu Temples and to build Mosques in place of them in the time of 760 CE, but the Maitraka forces killed Hussain Bin Amru and all his forces and won over them and the Hindu Temples with their Hindu deities&#x27; idols were present without any mosques. In the post Maitraka era, during 788 CE – 942 CE Rashtrakuta kings and queens of south Lata ruled over Bharuch. Their reign was attempted to be stopped by Umayyad incursions and raids, but the Rashtrakutas repelled all the Umayyad incursions and raids and they fully ruled Bharuch and the Prathiharas conquered Sindhu, Baluchistan, Punjab, Kangra, and Gandhara, Kamboja all from the Indian Subcontinental nations and the Umayyad Caliphate, all happening with the collaboration of the Rashtrakutas and other Indian subcontinental nations and near Bharuch itself.

===Chalukya era (942 CE–1304 CE)===
In 942, Mularaja established the rule of Chaulukya (Solanki) dynasty in Anahilvada Patan. Till this time the importance of Bharuch as the trade centre was continued. It was the capital of Lata region at the start of the 11th century CE. It was the centre for the ships coming from China and Sindhu and other regions of the world and the Indian Subcontinent in the 12th century and the Chalukya minister Vastupala had established a library in Bharuch. It was also during the time around from 1008 CE-1030 CE that Mahmud of Ghazni and his forces had made several attempted raids into Gujarat to raid the land and the Indian Subcontinental rulers of Gujarat and other lands with their forces defeated them all and all the forces of Mahmud of Ghazni were killed and defeated by them, and the surviving forces of Mahmud of Ghazni and Mahmud of Ghazni himself fled back to Central Asia each time they tried to sack the Somnath Temple and Gujarat. Later Mahmud of Ghazni himself was killed by Bhoja and Ghazni&#x27;s forces were killed by the Paramaras and their allies as known in historical sources. The destruction and killing of the Ghaznavid incursions by the Indian Subcontinent occurred in the Gujarat countryside including the area of Bharuch and outside it too.

Chakradhara Svami of Bharuch was during the era of the Chalukya Emperor Bhimadeva II. He established the Mahanubhava community which was spread in Maharashtra. In the 1100 CEs the region was subject to more attempted raids and their destruction by the Indian Subcontinental rulers and their forces by the Ghurids under Muhammad of Ghor and his forces and the Ghurid invasions of Muhammad of Ghor and his forces had all their forces killed by the Indian Subcontinental rulers and their forces and Muhammad of Ghor was killed by Prithviraj Chauhan and Ghori&#x27;s forces were killed by the Indian Subcontinent rulers and their forces too as said in historical sources.

===Middle Ages era (1293 CE–1872 CE)===

The middle era history of Bharuch district can be divided into three main parts, out of which, we can say that Delhi Sultanate era (1297 CE–1407 CE), Gujarat Sultanate era (1407 CE–1573 CE) and Mughal era (1573 CE–1736 CE). Bharuch was the centre of a prosperous merchant community and was one of the chief ports of Gujarat from ancient times to the first half of the 16th century.

=== Portuguese attacks ===
Until the beginning of the 16th century, the Portuguese Catholic Christians had little contact with the city, only in 1536 CE and 1547 CE, when there were attacks on operations from Daman and Diu against the governors of Gujarat for not paying for the Posters (Cartaz) system. After the attacks when Jorge de Menezes plundered Bharuch in 1547 CE, the city fell into insignificance.

In the 17th century CE, the Dutch and British made it a centre of their cotton purchases in Gujarat, and commercial warehouses were established in 1616 CE and 1618 CE by the British and Dutch respectively and others later. After that, in 1675 CE and 1686 CE, it was sacked by the Marathas. During this period, Bharuch was handed over to Kutubuddin. Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb demolished the fortification and the fort in 1660 CE by attacking. Later on, he built it again in 1686 CE. In 1772 CE, the British again attacked Bharuch, defeating Nawab Mu&#x27;azzaz Khan, allegedly with the help of his minister, Diwan Lallubhai. The British handed over Bharuch to the Marathas who ruled between 1783 CE and 1802 CE. From 1802 CE, Bharuch was returned to the East India Company under the terms of the Treaty of Salbai.

Bharuch was ruled by Delhi Sultanate for 94 years, The independent Gujarat Sultanate for 181 years, Mughal Empire for 164 years, Independent Nawabs for 36 years and Maratha rule for 19 years. During these times, revenue was collected from Bharuch and hundreds of people, especially the rich people, were killed. Same way in the cities on the banks of river Kavi in Jambusar Taluka there were many big and rich Hindu and Muslim communities. They were mainly formed by foreign and native traders.

As part of the Sultanate of Gujarat, it was subsequently annexed by the Mughals, and finally by the British. It is also situated near a small City called Halderva where two Islamic priests were found performing miracles.

On taking a bird&#x27;s eye view of the financial structure of the whole era of Gujarat&#x27;s sultanate, it can be seen that the area was cheaper and prosperous also when Akbar had won over the Bharuch during the Mughal era it had 12 Parganas. The annual growth of all 559 Cities of Bharuch, Hansot, Olpad, Mandvi, Galaa, Jambusar, Dahej, Koral, Ankleshvara and Tadakeshwar Parganas was Rs. 7.5 million. As given in the Tabaqat-i Akbari, there is a description of severe drought and the spread of a contentious epidemic in Gujarat, which was later fertilized and cured to the end.

===Mughal era (1605 CE–1627 CE)===
On understanding the importance of the Bharuch district as the trade centre, the British had taken permission from the Emperor Jahangir to establish the office during this era. Jahangir also permitted trade to the British. A big office building built by the Dutch in the 18th century can be seen in the Kansarvad in Bharuch. This building has a fort around it.

===Attacks and sackings by the Marathas (1664 CE to 1685 CE)===
Marathas had plundered Bharuch twice while it was under Mughal rule. Six droughts between 1681 CE and 1696 CE ended the ports&#x27; prosperity. By the end of the 17th century CE, their place was taken over due to the development of Mumbai port. In 1772 CE, after the control of Bharuch was taken by the British, the Dutch also left their trade centre in Bharuch.

=== Nawabs of Bharuch (1736 CE to 1772 CE) ===

When the Mughal subahdar Nizam-ul-Mulk was given the independent control of Bharuch as his fief, the Nizam soon threw off the suzerainty of the Mughals and started acting independent of Mughal rule. He appointed a loyal commander named Abdullah as the administrator of Bharuch with the title Nek Alam Khan&#x27;. Nek Alam Khan became independent of the Nizam&#x27;s control in 1736 CE and assumed independent control of Bharuch. This is the start of a short-lived dynasty of the Bharuch. Nek Alam Khan died in 1738 CE and was succeeded by his son Mirza beg Nawab of Broach in 1738 to 1752 After him Nawab of broach Mughal beg remained from 1755 to 1757 after him Ahmed beg remained from 1757 to 1768 or after him the last rule Nawab of broach the Imtiaz ud daula Muzud khan (moazziz khan) Bahadur Delarjung who was the last rule nawab of broach in 1772 after this the east India company took the broach. All this happened so his son Ahid ud din Khan who went to London in 1772 and got win the case in England.After this his political pension. so Nawab of Broach, India family also get the political Pension like Nawab of Surat.

=== Pre-independence era and Post-independence era ===

In which Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi of Bharuch also joined the national struggle.

In 1930 CE, the movement of Satyagraha had spread in Gujarat which had affected Jambusar also. On 12 March 1930 CE when Gandhi started the Dandi March with some of his supporters, the route of Dandi Kuch in Bharuch district was from Devata City of Borsad taluka via Jambusar Amod on the other side of the river Mahi via Bharuch and Ankleshvara on the other side of the river Narmada and reaching Dandi via Surat. The Dandi Kuch arrived in Kareli City on 20 and 22 March 1930 CE and became a memorial day in Jambusar, proving the history of the freedom struggle.
Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi a Gujarati Bhargava Brahmana of Bharuch district had participated in the Home Rule movement. He was imprisoned and released by the government for participating in struggles of the Bardoli movement in 1938 CE, &quot;Savinay Kanoon Bhang&quot; in 1930 CE and a personal movement in 1940 CE and India with Pakistan and the Indian Subcontinent eradicated British rule in 1947 CE and became independent countries. Bharuch, Gujarat became the territory of India. Chunilal Shivlal Modi, born in 1913 CE in Bharuch, participated in the &quot;Savinaya Kaanoon Bhang&quot; struggle in 1930 CE at 18 years old. Chandrashankar Manishankar Bhatt of Amod played a leading role in spreading the &quot;Hind Chhodo&quot; movement.

She was imprisoned for participating in the freedom movement, contributed significantly to the activities related to the uplift of women and activities of creative programs and was released later during independence. Like the other districts of Gujarat Bharuch district also had participated actively in various freedom struggles and had suffered loss of property and lives of their citizens. Almost all the talukas of Bharuch district had enlightened their people about political and national spirit by participating in freedom struggle through local leadership and history is the proof of the activities of the uplift of the people by implementing the creative programs instructed by Gandhi. Later, the Indian Subcontinent eradicated British rule in 1947 CE, became independent countries, and eradicated other European rules. At that time, Bharuch, Gujarat became a territory of India in the Indian Subcontinent and it is to this day.

==Geography and climate==
Bharuch is located at . It has an average elevation of 15 metres (49 feet). Bharuch is a port city situated on the banks of the Narmada River. The damming of the Narmada caused the original port facilities to close, the nearest port is now in Dahej. The Bharuch district is surrounded by Vadodara (North), Narmada (East) and Surat (South) districts. To the west is the Gulf of Khambhat.

Bharuch has a tropical savanna climate (under Köppen&#x27;s Climate classification), moderated strongly by the Arabian Sea. The summer begins in early March and lasts until June. April and May are the hottest months, the average maximum temperature being . Monsoon begins in late June and the Village receives about of rain by the end of September, with the average maximum being during those months.

Very often heavy monsoon rain brings floods in the Narmada basin area. The Village had witnessed major floods in the past, but now the floods have been controlled after the damming of the Narmada.

==Economy, commerce and industry==

Bharuch has always been prosperous because of its location on the Narmada River. Although water tends to be scarce in Gujarat, one never finds difficulty in getting water in Bharuch. As a result of this, agriculture and other linked commercial activities have flourished in Bharuch. Bharuch is also a central stopping point for many villages spread around its boundaries. People from these small villages come to Bharuch when they want to shop for new clothes or make a major purchase. Lately, a lot of retiring expatriates have been returning to Bharuch and building new houses giving the economy a boost.

Traditionally, Bharuch has been the centre of the peanut processing and marketing industry with a well-established brand name around the country. Almost none of the peanuts are grown in Bharuch itself but the best of the crops from neighbouring regions are brought here for processing. Bharuch is also the home of the Bandhni method of clothing design and is well known for this traditional art form.

At present, this heavily industrialised area is renowned for its textile mills, chemical plants, long-staple cotton, dairy products, and much more. Gujarat&#x27;s biggest liquid cargo terminal is situated here. It also houses many reputed multinational companies like Videocon, BASF, Reliance, Welspun Stahl, etc. Bharuch is a shopping centre well known for its salty peanuts. Because of the distinctive colour of the soil here that is ideal for cotton cultivation, Bharuch is sometimes referred to as &#x27;Kanam Pradesh&#x27; (black soil land).

Over the past 60 years, a major part of the population has moved to countries like the UK, USA, the African continent, and other parts of Europe. This brings some economical boost to the local businesses as people come back for vacations and spend their earnings here.

===Trade===
Bharuch was a major sea port in the important pre-compass coastal trading routes to points West, perhaps as far back as the days of the Pharaohs, which utilised the regular and predictable Monsoon winds or galleys. Many goods from the Far East were trans-shipped there for the annual monsoon winds making it a terminus for several key land-sea trade routes and Bharuch was definitely known to the Greeks, the various Persian Empires and in the Roman Republic and Empire and other Western centres of civilisation, through the end of the European Middle Ages.

In the 1st century AD, Bharuch port has been mentioned as Barigaza. Bharuch which was a prosperous and powerful port was an important part of Gujarat until the 16th century. Arab traders used to enter Gujarat via Bharuch. British, Valandas, and others accepted the importance of Bharuch and established premises and local staff here. At the end of the 17th century, the city was plundered twice but resurged quickly after the plunder and a proverb/refrain arose, &quot;Bhangyu Bhangyu Toye Bharuch&quot;.

As a trading depot, the limitations of coastal shipping made it a regular terminus via several mixed trade routes of the fabled spice and silk trading between East and West.

Narmada River&#x27;s inland access to central and northern India and with a location in the sheltered Gulf of Khambhat in the era of coastal sea travel grew and prospered as a trading transshipment centre and shipbuilding port. Until very modern times the only effective way to move goods was by water transport, and Bharuch had sheltered waters in an era without weather forecasting, compasses, and when shipping was necessarily limited to coastal navigation, and the general east–west course of the Narmada gave access to the rich inland empires at the upper reaches of the Narmada, including easy caravan access to the Ganges valley and the plains of Delhi.

Broach then (1500-1700) was a major textile manufacturing hub. The Broach city was famous for its bafta in the West and Southeast Asian markets. Bafta cloth was among the leading textile products exported to Europe and other parts of the world.

Bharuch cuisine also includes perennial favourites such as &quot;Mawa Ghari&quot; (a type of sweet pastry made from a laminated dough and filled with Khoa, different than Surati Ghari), &quot;Malai Ghari&quot; (filled with sweetened clotted cream, a unique sweet of Bharuch), Khichu, Undhiyu, Khaman, Nylon Khaman, Phaphada and Jalebi. Unlike cuisines in other parts of Gujarat, Bharuch cuisine is quite spicy. In the cooler winter months, people eat Ponk, a roasted cereal. The roasted salty peanuts of Bharuch are famous worldwide.

Most of the food outlets serve only vegetarian food, as a strong tradition of vegetarianism is maintained by the city&#x27;s Jain and Hindu communities. Roadside kiosks, called &quot;laaris&quot; or &quot;rekdis&quot;, are quite popular.

Non-vegetarian food is also available in some Muslim-dominated areas. Novel dishes made from eggs (ghotala, kheema, half fry) are specialties which are savoured with much gusto.

Bharuch roads and buildings department has painted the bridge golden. Golden Bridge is a part of Bharuch&#x27;s rich history. The British, who needed a bridge across Narmada to enable easier access for trade and administration officials in Mumbai, built the Golden Bridge, or Narmada Bridge as it is named, in 1881.

The bridge got its name due to the massive expenditure incurred in its construction. It was constructed seven times after being damaged several times due to strong currents of Narmada water. It was said that the cost incurred was so high that with the amount spent the bridge could be constructed in gold. The bridge has withstood many floods and natural disasters like earthquakes and provides daily transportation to the people of Ankleshwar and Bharuch.

A new bridge connects to the national highway.

<doc id="657346" wikidata="Q3503735" url="?curid=657346" title="Sun Bowl (stadium)">
<text>The Sun Bowl is an outdoor football stadium in the Southwestern United States, on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso. It is home to the UTEP Miners of Conference USA, and the late December college football bowl game, the Sun Bowl. The stadium opened in 1963 and has a nominal seating capacity of 51,500, although UTEP currently lists the capacity as 46,670.

==History==
The stadium, named for the game it hosts, was opened in 1963 with a Texas Western win over North Texas State on September 21. The opening play was a 54-yard touchdown run by Larry Durham of the Miners.

The land on which the stadium sits was originally donated by the university to El Paso County, who built the stadium for the school and the Sun Bowl game. Both had previously used Kidd Field, the current track and field venue, which seats 15,000. The city had realized that the game could not expand its audience or the list of teams that it could invite without a bigger stadium, so the Sun Bowl was built in a natural bowl adjacent to the west. It originally sat 30,000, with only the sideline grandstands. The playing field runs nearly north–south (tilted about at an elevation of above sea level.

===Renovations===
The current press box was added in 1969, and the stadium reached the capacity of 52,000 in 1982 with the addition of the north end zone stands and the expansion of the east stands. (The south end zone is still vacant, with the ground of the bowl covered with the school&#x27;s logos.)

The school retook control of the land and stadium in 2001, when hundreds of seats were removed as part of a re–configuration of the seating bowl to accommodate soccer, which lowered capacity to its current figure of 51,500.

The school&#x27;s Athletics Director, Jim Senter, announced on April 13, 2018 plans to renovate the Sun Bowl stadium. The $15 million project would include luxury boxes installed in a new press facility, renovation of the concourses and premium seating added on the west side of the stadium. The renovations were completed in time for the 2021 season.

==Notable events==
===Postseason college football===
====Sun Bowl====

The college football bowl game began in January 1936 and moved to the new stadium in December 1963. All games have been played in El Paso.

====All-star game====
On February 2, 2007, the stadium hosted the inaugural Texas vs. The Nation all-star college football game; the Nation defeated Texas 

===Concerts===
Since the 1990s, the Sun Bowl has hosted several concerts such as The Rolling Stones, U2, Pink Floyd, Ricky Martin, NSYNC, One Direction (a sellout), Guns &#x27;n&#x27; Roses, and a co-headlining performance by Mötley Crüe, Def Leppard, and Alice Cooper. Notably, the Mexican pop group RBD kicked off their Soy Rebelde Tour at the stadium, marking their first live show in nearly 15 years. British rock band Coldplay are scheduled to perform at Sun Bowl on June 13 and 14, 2025 as part of their Music of the Spheres World Tour, they will become the first act to hold two concerts at the stadium during a single tour.

===Other events===
On February 17, 2016, the stadium hosted festivities and a simulcast of the Mass held by Pope Francis during the pontiff&#x27;s visit to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, several miles away across the Rio Grande.

==Other tenants==
For a short time before moving to Dudley Field, the El Paso Patriots soccer team in the Premier Development League (now known as USL League Two) made its home at the Sun Bowl. The Patriots played their final seasons at Patriot Stadium.

<text>A geologic map or geological map is a special-purpose map made to show various geological features. Rock units or geologic strata are shown by color or symbols. Bedding planes and structural features such as faults, folds, are shown with strike and dip or trend and plunge symbols which give three-dimensional orientations features.

Stratigraphic contour lines may be used to illustrate the surface of a selected stratum illustrating the subsurface topographic trends of the strata. Isopach maps detail the variations in thickness of stratigraphic units. It is not always possible to properly show this when the strata are extremely fractured, mixed, in some discontinuities, or where they are otherwise disturbed.

==Symbols==
===Lithologies===
Rock units are typically represented by colors. Instead of (or in addition to) colors, certain symbols can be used. Different geologic mapping agencies and authorities have different standards for the colors and symbols to be used for rocks of differing types and ages.

===Orientations===
Geologists take two major types of orientation measurements (using a hand compass like a Brunton compass): orientations of planes and orientations of lines. Orientations of planes are measured as a &quot;strike&quot; and &quot;dip&quot;, while orientations of lines are measured as a &quot;trend&quot; and &quot;plunge&quot;.

Strike and dip symbols consist of a long &quot;strike&quot; line, which is perpendicular to the direction of greatest slope along the surface of the bed, and a shorter &quot;dip&quot; line on side of the strike line where the bed is going downwards. The angle that the bed makes with the horizontal, along the dip direction, is written next to the dip line. In the azimuthal system, strike and dip are often given as &quot;strike/dip&quot; (for example: 270/15, for a strike of west and a dip of 15 degrees below the horizontal). 

Trend and plunge are used for linear features, and their symbol is a single arrow on the map. The arrow is oriented in the downgoing direction of the linear feature (the &quot;trend&quot;) and at the end of the arrow, the number of degrees that the feature lies below the horizontal (the &quot;plunge&quot;) is noted. Trend and plunge are often notated as PLUNGE → TREND (for example: 34 → 86 indicates a feature that is angled at 34 degrees below the horizontal at an angle that is just east of true south).

==History==
The oldest preserved geologic map is the Turin papyrus (1150 BCE), which shows the location of building stone and gold deposits in Egypt.

The earliest geologic map of the modern era is the 1771 &quot;Map of Part of Auvergne, or figures of, The Current of Lava in which Prisms, Balls, Etc. are Made from Basalt. To be used with Mr. Demarest&#x27;s theories of this hard basalt. Engraved by Messr. Pasumot and Daily, Geological Engineers of the King.&quot; This map is based on Nicolas Desmarest&#x27;s 1768 detailed study of the geology and eruptive history of the Auvergne volcanoes and a comparison with the columns of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway of Ireland. He identified both landmarks as features of extinct volcanoes. The 1768 report was incorporated in the 1771 (French) Royal Academy of Science compendium.

The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. Maclure&#x27;s map shows the distribution of five classes of rock in what are now only the eastern states of the present-day US.

The first geologic map of Great Britain was created by William Smith in 1815 using principles (Smith&#x27;s laws) first formulated by Smith.

== Maps and mapping around the globe ==
===Singapore===
The first geological map of Singapore was produced in 1974, produced by the then Public Work Department. The publication includes a locality map, 8 map sheets detailing the topography and geological units, and a sheet containing cross sections of the island.

Since 1974, for 30 years, there were many findings reported in various technical conferences on newfound geology islandwide, but no new publication was produced. In 2006, Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency, with their developments in underground space promptly started a re-publication of the Geology of Singapore, second edition. The new edition that was published in 2009, contains a 1:75,000 geology map of the island, 6 maps (1:25,000) containing topography, street directory and geology, a sheet of cross section and a locality map.

The difference found between the 1976 Geology of Singapore report include numerous formations found in literature between 1976 and 2009. These include the Fort Canning Boulder Beds and stretches of limestone.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;geological map&quot; is used. The UK and Isle of Man have been extensively mapped by the British Geological Survey (BGS) since 1835; a separate Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (drawing on BGS staff) has operated since 1947.

Two 1:625,000 scale maps cover the basic geology for the UK. More detailed sheets are available at scales of 1:250,000, 1:50,000 and 1:10,000. The 1:625,000 and 1:250,000 scales show both onshore and offshore geology (the 1:250,000 series covers the entire UK continental shelf), whilst other scales generally cover exposures on land only.

Sheets of all scales (though not for all areas) fall into two categories:

# Superficial deposit maps (previously known as &quot;solid and drift&quot; maps) show both bedrock &quot;and&quot; the deposits on top of it.
# Bedrock maps (previously known as &quot;solid&quot; maps) show the underlying rock, without superficial deposits.

The maps are superimposed over a topographic map base produced by Ordnance Survey (OS), and use symbols to represent fault lines, strike and dip or geological units, boreholes etc. Colors are used to represent different geological units. Explanatory booklets (memoirs) are produced for many sheets at the 1:50,000 scale.

Small scale thematic maps (1:1,000,000 to 1:100,000) are also produced covering geochemistry, gravity anomaly, magnetic anomaly, groundwater, etc.

Although BGS maps show the British national grid reference system and employ an OS base map, sheet boundaries are not based on the grid. The 1:50,000 sheets originate from earlier &#x27;one inch to the mile&#x27; (1:63,360) coverage utilising the pre-grid Ordnance Survey One Inch Third Edition as the base map. Current sheets are a mixture of modern field mapping at 1:10,000 redrawn at the 1:50,000 scale and older 1:63,360 maps reproduced on a modern base map at 1:50,000. In both cases the original OS Third Edition sheet margins and numbers are retained. The 1:250,000 sheets are defined using lines of latitude and longitude, each extending 1° north-south and 2° east-west.

===United States===
In the United States, geologic maps are usually superimposed over a topographic map (and at times over other base maps) with the addition of a color mask with letter symbols to represent the kind of geologic unit. The color mask denotes the exposure of the immediate bedrock, even if obscured by soil or other cover. Each area of color denotes a geologic unit or particular rock formation (as more information is gathered new geologic units may be defined). However, in areas where the bedrock is overlain by a significantly thick unconsolidated burden of till, terrace sediments, loess deposits, or other important feature, these are shown instead. Stratigraphic contour lines, fault lines, strike and dip symbols, are represented with various symbols as indicated by the map key. Whereas topographic maps are produced by the United States Geological Survey in conjunction with the states, geologic maps are usually produced by the individual states. There are almost no geologic map resources for some states, while a few states, such as Kentucky and Georgia, are extensively mapped geologically.

<doc id="657359" wikidata="Q298052" url="?curid=657359" title="Cai Yan">
<text>Cai Yan ( 178 – post 206; or 170–215; or died  249), courtesy name Wenji, was a Chinese composer, poet, and writer who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. She was a daughter of Cai Yong. Her courtesy name was originally Zhaoji, but was changed to Wenji during the Jin dynasty to avoid naming taboo because the Chinese character for &quot;zhao&quot; in her courtesy name is the same as that in the name of Sima Zhao, the father of the Jin dynasty&#x27;s founding emperor, Sima Yan. She spent part of her life as the concubine of a powerful Xiongnu leader until 207, when the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government in the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty, paid a heavy ransom to bring her back to Han territory.

Cai Yan was celebrated for being &quot;erudite, eloquent and brilliant in rhythm&quot;; her biography was recorded in &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, volume 84: Biographies of Exemplary Women (卷八十四. 列女傳. 第七十四).

==Life==
Cai Yan was a daughter of Cai Yong, a famous Eastern Han dynasty scholar from Yu County (), (), which is around present-day Qi County, Kaifeng, Henan. She was married to Wei Zhongdao () in 192 but her husband died shortly after their marriage and they did not have any children. Between 194 and 195, when China entered a period of chaos, the Xiongnu nomads intruded into Han territory, captured Cai, and took her back as a prisoner to the northern lands. During her captivity, she married the Xiongnu &quot;Wise Prince of the Left&quot; and bore him two sons. 12 years later, the Han Chancellor, Cao Cao, paid a heavy ransom in the name of Cai&#x27;s father for her release. After Cai was freed, she returned to her homeland but left her children behind in Xiongnu territory. The reason Cao Cao wanted her back was that she was the sole surviving member of her clan and he needed her to placate the spirits of her ancestors.

After that, Cai married again, this time to Dong Si (), a local government official from her hometown. However, when Dong Si committed a capital crime later, Cai pleaded with Cao Cao for her husband&#x27;s acquittal. At the time, Cao Cao was hosting a banquet to entertain guests, who were stirred by Cai&#x27;s distressed appearance and behaviour. She asked him if he could provide her with yet another husband. He pardoned Dong Si.

Later in her life, she wrote two poems describing her turbulent years.

== In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; ==
Cai Yan briefly appears in chapter 71 of the novel, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, a historical novel of 14th century which romanticizes events prior to and during the Three Kingdoms period of China.

Cao Cao was on a march to battle with Liu Bei during the Hanzhong Campaign when he passed by Cai Yan&#x27;s residence.

Cao Cao came to the gates with a few attendants. Upon hearing who the guest was, Cai Yan hurriedly raced to meet them, and after Cao Cao took a seat in the household, he noticed a tablet which contained mix-matched eight words that he couldn&#x27;t interpret. Cai Yan pointed out that her father wrote it after hearing a specific tale. Yang Xiu, one of the men whom Cao Cao brought along, declared he knew the riddle on the tablet.

Cao Cao and his subordinates later left the house and Yang Xiu mentioned what the eight words meant using wordplay.

==Legacy==
Like her father, Cai Wenji was an established calligrapher of her time, and her works were often praised along with her father&#x27;s. Her poems were noted for their sorrowful tone, which paralleled her hard life. The famous guqin piece &quot;Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute&quot; is traditionally attributed to her, although the authorship is a perennial issue for scholarly debate. The other two poems, both named &quot;Poem of Sorrow and Anger&quot; (), were known to be written by her.

The following is an excerpt from the &quot;Poem of Sorrow and Anger&quot; in five-character form ():

In addition to her surviving poems, a volume of &quot;Collective Works of Cai Wenji&quot; was known to have survived until as late as the Sui dynasty but had been lost by the Tang dynasty.

Cai Wenji inherited some 4,000 volumes of ancient books from her father&#x27;s vast collection. However, they were destroyed in the ravages of war. At Cao Cao&#x27;s request, Cai recited 400 of them from memory and wrote them on paper.

==Literary and artistic tributes==

The stories of Cai reverberate primarily with feelings of sorrow, and inspired later artists to keep portraying her past. Her return to Han territory has been the subject of numerous paintings titled &quot;Cai Wenji Returns to Her Homeland&quot; () by various painters since the Tang dynasty, as well as renderings in traditional Beijing opera.

==In popular culture==
Guo Moruo wrote a play on her life in 1959. In 1976, a crater on Mercury was named Ts&#x27;ai Wen-Chi after Cai Wenji, citing her as &quot;Chinese poet and composer&quot;. In 1994, a crater on Venus was named Caiwenji after Cai Wenji, citing her as &quot;Chinese poet&quot;.
Cai Wenji appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce 2&quot; and &quot;Dynasty Warriors 7&quot; (her debut as a playable character in North American and European ports). She also appears in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; video game series and in &quot;Dynasty Warriors 6: Empires&quot; as a non-playable character. She is also a playable character in &quot;Warriors Orochi 3&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi 4&quot;. Her fighting style relies on casting energy balls and shock waves by strumming her harp.

<doc id="657360" wikidata="Q3185198" url="?curid=657360" title="Joseph Lagrange (soldier)">
<text>Count Joseph Lagrange (; 10 January 1763 – 16 January 1836) was a French soldier who rose through the ranks and gained promotion to the rank of general officer during the French Revolutionary Wars, subsequently pursuing a successful career during the Napoleonic Wars and winning promotion to the top military rank of General of Division. His name is inscribed on the west side of the arc de triomphe de l&#x27;Étoile. He later became a politician in Gers department – in its capital of Auch there is a portrait of him in the town museum and the gendarmerie barracks was named after him in January 2002.

==Life==

===Revolutionary Wars===
He was the son of Armand Lagrange, a merchant, and his wife Marianne Baruit. He became mayor of Lectoure in 1791 but three years later joined the army as a captain in the 2nd Gers Volunteer Battalion, fighting in Carinthia and in Tyrol during the 1796 and 1797 Italian campaigns. Rising rapidly through the ranks, he was chosen by Bonaparte to take part in the French invasion of Egypt. He fought in Egypt and Syria and rose to brigadier general on 14 July 1798. He entered Cairo at the head of the vanguard and distinguished himself at the siege of El Arish, the siege of Acre and the battle of Heliopolis. On his return from Egypt he was made inspector general of the gendarmerie and a général de division, before being put in command of the 14th Military Division on 23 September 1800. He was made a knight of the Légion d&#x27;honneur on 11 December 1803, rising to grand officer on 14 June 1804.

===Napoleonic Wars===

In 1805 Lagrange was made commander in chief of an expedition against the British colonies on the Antilles. Landing at Roseau, he captured the ships in the port, the garrison and its artillery and supplies before destroying the fortifications and magazines. Returning to Europe early in 1806, he was put in command of a division sent to Holland and contributed to the success of the 1806 Prussian campaign against the elector of Hesse-Cassel under the command of maréchal Mortier. He was a member of the committee which organized the Kingdom of Westphalia and so became minister of war and chief of staff to its first king, Jérôme Bonaparte.

In 1808 he was summoned to fight in the Peninsular War, where he fought in the attack on Lascanti on 18 November before pursuing the enemy to Terracina. Under maréchal Lannes he contributed to the victory at the battle of Tudela and the major losses it inflicted on Castaños. He was ordered to Germany in 1809 to command Charles I, Grand Duke of Baden&#x27;s contingent. On 26 April 1810 he was made a count of the empire. He was made governor of Haute-Souabe at the start of the French invasion of Russia in 1812 and also commander of a division in 9th Army Corps. In 1813 he moved to maréchal Marmont&#x27;s corps, fighting in the siege of Hoertel, the marshlands of Bobinsk, the battle of Dresden and the battle of Leipzig. He also distinguished himself in the French campaign of 1814, notably in the battle of Lesmont on 2 February 1814 and the battle of Champaubert on 10 February 1814, where he was severely wounded in the head.

=== Politician ===
He retired to Gisors when Napoleon first fell and did not come out of retirement for the Hundred Days. He became president of Gers&#x27; electoral college in 1817 and was elected as that department&#x27;s deputy on 20 September, by 513 out of 797 votes. He sat in the Royalist majority and was made inspector general of the gendarmerie again in 1818. On 1 May 1821 he was made a Grand Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

He took no part in the July Revolution of 1830. Louis-Philippe I&#x27;s government appointed him to the Chamber of Peers on 9 November 1831 and allowed him to retire on 11 June 1832 at the rank of lieutenant general. He sat with the ministerial majority in the upper chamber until his death.

== Marriage and issue ==
On 6 November 1802 he married Marie de Talhouët (1786–1849) in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. She was the eldest daughter of Louis Céleste de Talhouët-Bonamour (1761–1812), marquis de Talhouët, and his wife Élisabeth Baude de La Vieuville (1764–1814). They had issue:

# Napoléon Joseph (1804–1812) ;
# Caroline Élisabeth (1806–1870), in 1824 married Louis Alix de Nompère de Champagny (1796–1870), 2nd duke of Cadore, son of Jean-Baptiste Nompère de Champagny, with issue ;
# Mathilde Louise (1809–1873), in 1826 married Napoléon Bessières (1802–1856), 2nd duke of Istrie, son of maréchal Bessières ;
# &quot;Emma&quot; (1810–1876), married Charles Ferron de La Ferronays (1805–1863), comte de La Ferronays, with issue ;
# &quot;Frédéric&quot; (1815–1883), in 1850 married Émilie de Riquet de Caraman (1832–1851), daughter of prince Joseph de Riquet de Caraman (1808-1886), without issue.

<doc id="657361" wikidata="Q2588785" url="?curid=657361" title="Hiroki Kikuta">
<text>is a Japanese composer and game designer. His major works are &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;, &quot;Soukaigi&quot;, and &quot;Koudelka&quot;, for which he also acted as producer and concept designer. He has composed music for seven other games, and worked as a concept designer in addition to composer for the unreleased MMORPG &quot;Chou Bukyo Taisen&quot;. He became interested in music at an early age, but earned a degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University. He spent the next few years working first as a manga illustrator, then as a composer for anime series, before coming to work for Square in 1991.

After composing the soundtracks for his first three best-known works, he formed his own video game production company, Sacnoth, for which he was the president and CEO. After producing and composing &quot;Koudelka&quot; in 1999, he left to become a freelance composer. Since his departure he has formed his own record label, Norstrilia, through which he produces albums of his own compositions and collaborations with other artists, as well as his previous scores. His music has been performed in concerts such as the &quot;Symphonic Fantasies&quot; concerts in Cologne, Germany in September 2009, and selections of his works have been published as piano arrangements in sheet music books.

==Biography==
===Early life===
As a child, Kikuta was very interested in music, but while growing up in rural Japan had limited access to it. As a result, he would listen to whatever music was on the radio, regardless of genre, and also to the music in films. His first instrument was a classical guitar, which he taught himself without lessons. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that he began to feel his potential as a composer. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books and listening to a wide variety of musical genres. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. While in college, Kikuta played arcade video games such as &quot;The Tower of Druaga&quot; (1984).

After graduating from Kansai, Kikuta worked first as a manga illustrator under the pseudonym and later as an anime composer. The manga he illustrated, including one titled &quot;Raven&quot;, were done under the pen name . As an anime composer, he worked on &quot;The Adventure of Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Snow White&quot;. 

In 1991, Kikuta was hired by Square (now Square Enix), as a composer. After being rejected by his first choice, Nihon Falcom, he applied to Square without expecting to be hired, as they had many applicants for the job and he had never played any of the company&#x27;s games. At the interview, however, Nobuo Uematsu was attracted to their shared love of progressive rock, and he was chosen over 100 other applicants. He started off debugging &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and creating sound effects for &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot;, as there were not enough game projects in development to open up new jobs for Square&#x27;s new hires, but Kikuta was soon given game soundtracks to compose.

===Career===

During his seven years at Square, Kikuta composed the soundtracks to only three games: &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and &quot;Soukaigi&quot; for the PlayStation. Kikuta says that he was given complete freedom to compose the soundtracks, in that he was given no direction at all as to how to compose the music; he began working on the music before the design of the game was finalized. This freedom was helped by the fact that Uematsu ran the music group as a separate division in the company from the game developers. Kikuta was chosen for &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; after Kenji Ito, the composer for the first game in the &quot;Mana&quot; series, &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, was unable to work on the sequel due to other demands, including the soundtrack to &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot;. At the time, Square typically had composers dedicated to one game throughout its development, and so Ito could not take on both projects at once.

Rather than create MIDI versions of his compositions, like most game composers of that time did, and hand these over to the sound engineering department, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super Nintendo. This way he would know exactly how the pieces would sound on the system&#x27;s hardware instead of having to deal with audio hardware differences between the original composition and the limited palette of the Super Nintendo. Kikuta spent nearly 24 hours a day in his office working on the soundtrack, alternating between composing and editing. The first track he composed as &quot;The Child of the Fairy Tribe&quot;. &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; led to an arranged album, &quot;Secret of Mana+&quot;, which is composed of a single 50-minute track made up of &quot;experimental&quot; sounds like waterfalls, bird calls, and cell phone sounds. Kikuta said in 2024 that he made the arranged album as a response to the stress of dealing with the restrictions of creating the original soundtrack, by instead creating something unrestrained and free.

For &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;, Kikuta was assisted by a sound programmer, Hidenori Suzuki, which allowed him to compose over three times the amount of music he had created for &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;. Kikuta decided to take the music in a &quot;different direction&quot; than &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;″s, as he did not think he could surpass it with the same concept. The move to the PlayStation for &quot;Soukaigi&quot; allowed Kikuta to focus on creating live music for the soundtrack, rather than tweaking the synthesizer instruments to make the music files fit in the game cartridge as he had to for the Super Nintendo. He used the added audio processing power to expand his musical creativity, including pieces such as songs in unintelligible Thai and Malaysian by Japanese singers. The game itself, however, was not a success, and Kikuta decided that he wanted more direct control over the next project he worked on.

After Kikuta finished &quot;Soukaigi&quot;, he left Square and founded the video game development company Sacnoth, assuming the position of the president and CEO from 1998 to 1999. During this time, the company created &quot;Koudelka&quot; for the PlayStation; Kikuta was credited as the concept designer, game planner, scenario writer, producer and composer. His philosophy in designing video games is that the best projects have a limited number of people designing the overall experience and making key decisions. He tried to follow this philosophy in creating &quot;Koudelka&quot;, and tried to bring a sense of &quot;obsessive passion&quot; to the project, reading what he claims were over 100 books on British history and taking the design team on a trip to Wales to study the country. The game was released in December 1999 to poor reviews which criticized the game&#x27;s combat system, though they praised the concept, art direction, and music. Kikuta left Sacnoth soon after; the company changed its name to Nautilus and went on to produce four more games including the &quot;Shadow Hearts&quot; series before folding in 2007.

In March 2001, Kikuta founded Norstrilia, named after the novel of the same name. The company serves as his private record label, and publishes his albums. For the next few years he worked as concept designer, game planner, and composer for &quot;Chou Bukyo Taisen&quot;, a Chinese MMORPG, the original design for which he proposed to Enix. Development of the game ceased in 2004 due to disagreements between Enix and the Chinese company that was to maintain the game while it was in progress and it was never released. He spent the next few years composing for video games only released in Japan, including the eroge visual novel &quot;Sora no Iro, Mizu no Iro&quot; and the MMORPG &quot;Concerto Gate&quot;. Beginning in 2010 he started working as a composer for projects with several artists, such as &quot;Soulcalibur V&quot; (2010) and &quot;Rise of Mana&quot; (2014), which continues to date; his first solo work since 2010 was &quot;Indivisible&quot; in 2019.

Kikuta released &quot;Lost Files&quot;, his first album of original music, in 2006. The album includes the demo tapes Kikuta submitted when first applying for the job of game composer at Square, using the sound source of the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was followed in August 2007 by his second original album, &quot;Alphabet Planet&quot;. He has also composed three other albums and two singles in conjunction with other singers or performers; these albums have been released through his Norstrilia label. He released a third original album in 2011, titled &quot;Tiara&quot;.

==Legacy==
A piece from &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra for the third &quot;Orchestral Game Music Concert&quot; in 1993, while one from &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; was performed for the fifth event in 1996. His music from &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was also performed at the fifth &quot;Symphonic Game Music Concert&quot; in 2007 at the Gewandhaus Leipzig, Germany. Music from &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; made up one fourth of the music in the &quot;Symphonic Fantasies&quot; concerts in Cologne in September 2009 which were produced by Thomas Böcker as a part of the &quot;Game Concerts&quot; series. In 2012, five more performances of &quot;Symphonic Fantasies&quot; were given in Tokyo, Stockholm, and again in Cologne, with an additional performance in 2016 in London with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Eckehard Stier.

Two compilation books of piano sheet music from the &quot;Mana&quot; series have been published as &quot;Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music&quot; first and second editions; songs from &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; are featured in both. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. Selections of remixes of Kikuta&#x27;s work appear on Japanese remix albums, called dōjin, and on English remixing websites such as OverClocked ReMix. Kikuta has said that he enjoys listening to these works, mentioning OverClocked ReMix by name.

==Musical style and influences==
Kikuta finds composing music to be natural, &quot;like breathing&quot;. He considers it to be his &quot;vocation&quot;, and contrasts it with designing and creating video games, which he calls his &quot;wish&quot; and finds to be very difficult to do in comparison to composition. Kikuta does not worry about the style of music that he composes, considering it to only be a tool or method. As a result, his music is frequently composed of combinations of styles mixed together. He is inspired to create his music by things that he has seen, especially while traveling; he credits much of the musical imagery in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; as being inspired by several islands in Fiji he has visited. Rather than trying to be a &quot;pure artist&quot; that creates art for art&#x27;s sake, Kikuta says that his primary goal in composing is to entertain the listeners. He has not been influenced by other video game composers, though he claims to admire Hitoshi Sakimoto, who also worked at Square. He has named Pink Floyd as his single biggest musical influence, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth as the artist he would most like to collaborate with. Kikuta stated that his favorite song he composed was &quot;ouverture&quot; from &quot;Concerto Gate&quot;.
