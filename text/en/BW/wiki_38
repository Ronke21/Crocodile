<text>Blanding&#x27;s turtle (&quot;Emydoidea blandingii)&quot; is a species of semi-aquatic turtle of the family Emydidae. This species is native to central and eastern parts of Canada and the United States. It is considered to be an endangered species throughout much of its range. Blanding&#x27;s turtle is of interest in longevity research, as it shows few or no common signs of aging and is physically active and capable of reproduction into eight or nine decades of life.

==Taxonomy==
There are differences of opinion as to the genus for this species; both &quot;Emys&quot; and &quot;Emydoidea&quot; occur in published sources in 2009, 2010, and 2011.

==Etymology==
Both the specific name, &quot;blandingii&quot;, and the common name, Blanding&#x27;s turtle, are in honor of American naturalist Dr. (1773–1857).

==Description==
Blanding&#x27;s turtle is a medium-sized turtle with an average straight carapace length of approximately with a maximum of . A distinguishing feature of this turtle is the bright yellow chin and throat. The carapace, or upper shell, is domed, but slightly flattened along the midline, and is oblong when viewed from above. The carapace is speckled with numerous yellow or light-colored flecks or streaks on a dark background. The plastron, or lower shell, is yellow with dark blotches symmetrically arranged. The head and legs are dark, and usually speckled or mottled with yellow. Blanding&#x27;s turtle is also called the &quot;semi-box&quot; turtle, for although the plastron is hinged, the plastral lobes do not shut as tight as the box turtles&#x27;.

==Reproduction==
Blanding&#x27;s turtle takes 14–20 years to reach sexual maturity. Mating probably occurs in April and early May with nesting beginning in early June and lasting throughout the month. Clutch size varies from region to region. In New York, the clutch size ranges from five to twelve eggs, with an average of eight.

==Behavior and life span==
Blanding&#x27;s turtle overwinters under or near water, in mud, or under vegetation or debris. This is known as brumation. During the nesting season, a female Blanding&#x27;s turtle may be found more than a kilometer from where it hibernated. It is omnivorous, eating crustaceans (including crayfish), insects (such as dragonfly nymphs and aquatic beetles), snails and other invertebrates, fish, fish eggs, frogs, carrion, berries, seeds, and vegetable debris. It will eat coontail, duckweed, sedge, and bulrush. It is capable of catching live fish. Based on the extreme lack of aging symptoms and lack of age related decline, this turtle is considered a negligibly senescent species.

Blanding&#x27;s turtle is a timid turtle and may plunge into water and remain on the bottom for hours when alarmed. If away from water, the turtle will withdraw into its shell. It is very gentle and rarely attempts to bite. It is very agile and a good swimmer.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The geographic range of &quot;E. blandingii&quot; centres on the Great Lakes, and extends from central Nebraska and Minnesota (where it twice failed to become the state reptile) eastward through southern Ontario and the south shore of Lake Erie as far east as northern New York. In Nebraska, this turtle is uncommon in the eastern portion of the state, but common to abundant in the Sand Hills region lakes, ponds, and streams. There are also isolated populations in southeastern New York (Dutchess County), New England, and Nova Scotia.

Its general habitat is wetlands with clean shallow water. It is known to bask on logs, and will wander far from water, particularly when nesting. It generally nests in sunny areas, with well drained soil. Younger turtles may bask on sedge and alder hummocks. Young will often travel far in search of mating sites, new habitat, or new food sources, as do elder turtles.

==Conservation status==
The primary threat to Blanding&#x27;s turtle is habitat fragmentation and destruction as well as nest predation by unnaturally large populations of predators. It is listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List as endangered in some U.S. states, and as either threatened or endangered throughout Canada, though in the U.S. it has no federal status. International trade in Blanding&#x27;s turtle is restricted, as the species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade is regulated by the CITES permit system.

This species can also be adversely affected by prescribed burns. During fall and late spring hatchlings move overland and it is recommended that prescribed burns should be avoided during these times.

The U.S. states in which it is considered endangered are Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and South Dakota. It is considered threatened in New York and Iowa. In Michigan, Blanding&#x27;s turtle is also fully protected as a special concern species, making it unlawful to kill, take, trap, possess, buy, or sell. In Lake County, Illinois, a long-term species recovery program has been underway since 2009.

In Canada, the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence River population in Ontario and Quebec is federally threatened, and the Nova Scotia population is endangered.
Conservation and recovery efforts in Nova Scotia have been in place for two decades and rely on habitat and life history monitoring based on the work of researchers and volunteers. Habitat protection has proven crucial. The population in Kejimkujik has been placed under the highest level of protection; the McGowan Lake population was initially protected by Bowater but has since been taken over by the Province. In Pleasant River, Nova Scotia Nature Trust protects four separate segments of critical habitat.

<text>Staten Island Chuck, also referred to more formally as Charles G. Hogg, is a groundhog who resided in the Staten Island Zoo in Staten Island, New York City. He serves as the official groundhog meteorologist of New York City, who predicts the duration of winter each February 2 on Groundhog Day. The tradition dates back to 1981. He makes the prediction based on whether or not he sees his shadow during the ceremony between 7:00 A.M. and 7:30 A.M. on Groundhog Day. The ceremony at the zoo is sometimes attended and officiated by the Mayor of New York City. Chuck&#x27;s prediction for 2025 was early spring, opposite the prediction made by Punxsutawney Phil.

==Notable moments==
Staten Island Chuck bit New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009. Over his 12 years as mayor, Bloomberg attended 7 of 12 ceremonies.

Chuck was later replaced by his granddaughter, Charlotte, for the first Groundhog Day ceremony held during the mayoralty of Bill de Blasio. During that ceremony held on February 2, 2014, de Blasio dropped Charlotte onto the ground in front of &quot;shocked schoolchildren&quot;. Charlotte died on February 9, 2014, although the Staten Island Zoo did not make this fact public until several months later. According to the &quot;New York Post&quot;, a necropsy attributed Charlotte&#x27;s death to &quot;acute internal injuries&quot; consistent with a fall. Despite accusations of a coverup and reports that De Blasio had killed the groundhog, the zoo initially claimed that the animal died of natural causes, and later took the position that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that Charlotte&#x27;s death was caused by the fall.

Chuck&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte Jr., served as a stand-in for him at Groundhog Day 2015. On February 2, 2015, this female &quot;Staten Island Chuck&quot; walked out of a hutch that an elevator had lifted onto the stage of a portable Plexiglas habitat, while de Blasio watched from six feet (1.8 m) away. De Blasio did not attend the 2016 ceremonies, as he was in Iowa campaigning for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Presidential bid; Lieutenant Governor of New York Kathy Hochul officiated the groundhog ceremony in de Blasio&#x27;s stead. He likewise did not attend the ceremony from 2017 to 2019, and in 2020 confirmed that he has no plans to ever return to the Groundhog Day Ceremony at the Staten Island Zoo: &quot;I tried it, it didn&#x27;t end well, I won&#x27;t be back,&quot; de Blasio said.

In 2017, Staten Island Chuck made his publication debut in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Groundhog Chuck Builds a Weather Station&quot;. Authored by known animal lover and supporter of the outdoors, Staten Island&#x27;s Deputy Borough President Ed Burke, the book follows Chuck and his zoo friends on an adventure to ensure the right weather forecast is always made.

==Past predictions==
The Staten Island Zoo has claimed that Chuck correctly predicted the duration of winter 26 out of 32 years as of 2013, an 82% success rate.

Early spring is defined as a spring in which a majority of days between Groundhog Day and the March equinox have a high temperature of over .

<text>Kedron of Alexandria, also called Kedronos, was the 4th Patriarch of Alexandria.

When the priest and Bishops who served in the country learned that the Bishop Avilius, Patriarch of Alexandria had died, they gathered in Alexandria to consult with the Christian people there, and elected Kedronos as successor. It was said that he was among those who had been baptized by Saint Mark, and he was enthroned Patriarch in Babab (October), in 96 AD, during the reign of the Emperor Nerva.

Kedron was arrested and martyred in the persecution under the Emperor Trajan. It was said that the reason for the arrest was that one of the Roman governors had said to him, &quot;Why do you not have our gods partake with your God and continue to worship him?&quot; So he answered, &quot;Because we do not prostrate before any other.&quot; His martyrdom took place on the 21st of Paoni (28 June), in 106 AD.

Kedron was known as chaste and virtuous. He led the Church for eleven years, one month, and twelve days.

<doc id="642813" wikidata="Q4246726" url="?curid=642813" title="Culture-historical archaeology">
<text>Culture-historical archaeology is an archaeological theory that emphasises defining historical societies into distinct ethnic and cultural groupings according to their material culture.

It originated in the late nineteenth century as cultural evolutionism began to fall out of favor with many antiquarians and archaeologists. It was gradually superseded in the mid-twentieth century by processual archaeology. Cultural-historical archaeology had in many cases been influenced by a nationalist political agenda, being utilised to prove a direct cultural and/or ethnic link from prehistoric and ancient peoples to modern nation-states, something that has in many respects been disproved by later research and archaeological evidence.

First developing in Germany among those archaeologists surrounding Rudolf Virchow, culture-historical ideas would later be popularised by Gustaf Kossinna. Culture-historical thought would be introduced to British archaeology by the Australian archaeologist V. Gordon Childe in the late 1920s. In the United Kingdom and United States, culture-history came to be supplanted as the dominant theoretical paradigm in archaeology during the 1960s, with the rise of processual archaeology. Nevertheless, elsewhere in the world, culture-historical ideas continue to dominate.

== Background ==
Webster remarked that the defining feature of culture-historical archaeology was its &quot;statements which reveal common notions about the nature of ancient cultures; about their qualities; about how they related to the material record; and thus about how archaeologists might effectively study them.&quot;

Webster noted that the second defining feature of culture-historical thought was its emphasis on classification and typologies.

==Causes==
Culture-historical archaeology arose during a somewhat tumultuous time in European intellectual thought. The Industrial Revolution had spread across many nations, leading to the creation of large urban centres, most of which were filled with poverty stricken proletarian workers. This new urban working class had begun to develop a political voice through socialism, threatening the established political orders of many European states. Whilst some intellectuals had championed the Industrial Revolution as a progressive step forward, there were many who had seen it as a negative turn of events, disrupting the established fabric of society. This latter view was taken up by the Romanticist movement, which was largely made up of artists and writers, who popularised the idea of an idyllic ancient agrarian society.

There was also a trend that was developing among the European intelligentsia that began to oppose the concept of cultural evolutionism (that culture and society gradually evolved and progressed through stages), instead taking the viewpoint that human beings were inherently resistant to change.

===Geographic variability and the concept of &quot;culture&quot;===
Historian of archaeology Bruce Trigger considered the development of culture-historical archaeology to be &quot;a response to growing awareness of geographical variability in the archaeological record&quot; at a time when the belief in cultural evolutionary archaeology was declining in western and central Europe. Throughout the 19th century, an increasing amount of archaeological material had been collected in Europe, in part as a result of land reclamation projects, increased agricultural production and construction, the foundation of museums and establishment of archaeological teaching positions at universities. As a result of this, archaeologists had come to increasingly realise that there was a great deal of variability in the artifacts uncovered across the continent. Many felt that this variability was not comfortably explained by preexisting evolutionary paradigms.

Culture-historical archaeology adopted the concept of &quot;culture&quot; from anthropology, where cultural evolutionary ideas had also begun to be criticised. In the late 19th century, anthropologists like Franz Boas and Friedrich Ratzel were promoting the idea that cultures represented geographically distinct entities, each with their own characteristics that had developed largely through the chance accumulation of different traits. Similar ideas were also coming from Germany&#x27;s neighbour, Austria, at around this time, namely from two anthropologist Roman Catholic priests, Fritz Graebner and Wilhelm Schmidt, as well as by the archaeologist Oswald Menghin.

===Nationalism and racialism===

Bruce Trigger also argued that the development of culture-historical archaeology was in part due to the rising tide of nationalism and racism in Europe, which emphasised ethnicity as the main factor shaping history. Such nationalistic sentiment began to be adopted within academic disciplines by intellectuals who wished to emphasise solidarity within their own nations – in the face of social unrest caused by industrialization – by blaming neighbouring states. Under such a nationalist worldview, people across Europe came to see different nationalities – such as the French, Germans and English – as being biologically different from one another, and it was argued that their behaviour was determined by these racial differences as opposed to social or economic factors.

Having been inspired and influenced by European nationalism, in turn, culture-historical archaeology would be utilised in support of nationalist political causes. In many cases, nationalists used culture-historical archaeological interpretations to highlight and celebrate the prehistoric and ancient past of their ancestors, and prove an ethnic and cultural link to them. As such, many members of various European nations placed an emphasis on archaeologically proving a connection with a particular historical ethnicity, for instance the French often maintained that they were the ethnic and cultural descendants of the ancient Gauls, whilst the English did the same with the Anglo-Saxons and the Welsh and Irish with the Celts, and archaeologists in these countries were encouraged to interpret the archaeological evidence to fit these conclusions.

One of the most notable examples of a nationalist movement utilising culture-historical archaeology was that of the Nazi Party, who obtained power in Germany in 1933 and established a totalitarian regime that emphasised the alleged racial supremacy of the German race and sought to unify all German speakers under a single political state. The Nazis were influenced by the culture-historical ideas of Kossinna, and used archaeology to support their claims regarding the behaviour of prehistoric Germans, in turn supporting their own policies.

==History==

===Early development: 1869–1925===
Culture-historical archaeology first developed in Germany in the late 19th century. In 1869, the German Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistoric Archaeology (&quot;Urgeschichte&quot;) had been founded, an organisation that was dominated by the figure of Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902), a pathologist and leftist politician. He advocated the union of prehistoric archaeology with cultural anthropology and ethnology into a singular prehistoric anthropology which would identify prehistoric cultures from the material record and try to connect them to later ethnic groups who were recorded in the written, historical record. Although the archaeological work undertaken by Virchow and his fellows was cultural-historical in basis, it did not initially gain a significant following in the country&#x27;s archaeological community, the majority of whom remained devoted to the dominant cultural evolutionary trend.

In 1895, a librarian who was fascinated by German prehistory, Gustaf Kossinna (1858–1931), presented a lecture in which he tried to connect the tribes who had been recorded as living between the Rhine and Vistula in 100 BCE with cultures living in that region during the Neolithic. Appointed Professor of Archaeology at the University of Berlin, in 1909 he founded the German Society for Prehistory (&quot;Vorgeschichte&quot;). He would proceed to further publicise his culture-historical approach in his subsequent books, &quot;Die Herkunft der Germanen&quot; (&quot;The Origin of the Germans&quot;), which was published in 1911, and the two-volume &quot;Ursprung und Verbreitung der Germanen&quot; (&quot;Origin and Expansion of the Germans&quot;), which was published between 1926 and 1927. A staunch nationalist and racist, Kossinna lambasted fellow German archaeologists for taking an interest in non-German societies, such as those of Egypt and the Classical World, and used his publications to support his views on German nationalism. Glorifying the German peoples of prehistory, he used an explicitly culture-historical approach in understanding them, and proclaimed that these German peoples were racially superior to their Slavic neighbours to the east.

Believing that an individual&#x27;s ethnicity determined their behaviour, the core of Kossinna&#x27;s approach was to divide Temperate Europe into three large cultural groupings: Germans, Celts and Slavs, based upon the modern linguistic groups. He then divided each of these cultural groupings into smaller &quot;cultures&quot;, or tribes, for instance dividing the Germans up into Saxons, Vandals, Lombards and Burgundians. He believed that each of these groups had its own distinctive traditions which were present in their material culture, and that by mapping out the material culture in the archaeological record, he could trace the movement and migration of different ethnic groups, a process he called &quot;siedlungsarchäologie&quot; (&quot;settlement archaeology&quot;). Much of Kossinna&#x27;s work was criticised by other German archaeologists, but nevertheless his basic culture-historical manner of interpreting the past still came to dominance in the country&#x27;s archaeological community; Trigger noted that his work &quot;marked the final replacement of an evolutionary approach to prehistory by a culture-historical one&quot; and that for that, he must be viewed as an &quot;innovator&quot; whose work was &quot;of very great importance&quot;.

As it became the dominant archaeological theory within the discipline, a number of prominent cultural-historical archaeologists rose to levels of influence. The Swedish archaeologist Oscar Montelius was one of the most notable, as he studied the entirety of the European archaeological prehistoric record, and divided it into a number of distinct temporal groups based upon grouping together various forms of artifacts.

===Britain and the U.S.===

Culture-historical archaeology was first introduced into British scholarship from continental Europe by an Australian prehistorian, V. Gordon Childe. A keen linguist, Childe was able to master a number of European languages, including German, and was well acquainted with the works on archaeological cultures written by Kossina. Following a period as Private Secretary to the Premier of New South Wales (NSW), Childe moved to London in 1921 for a position with the NSW Agent General, then spent a few years travelling Europe. In 1927, Childe took up a position as the Abercrombie Professor of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh. This was followed by &quot;The Danube in Prehistory&quot; (1929), in which Childe examined the archaeology along the Danube river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe, and subsequently he believed that it was via the Danube that various new technologies travelled westward in antiquity. In &quot;The Danube in Prehistory&quot;, Childe introduced the concept of an archaeological culture (which up until then had been largely restrained purely to German academics), to his British counterparts. This concept would revolutionise the way in which archaeologists understood the past, and would come to be widely accepted in future decades.

== Concepts ==

=== Distinct historical cultures ===
The core point to culture-historical archaeology was its belief that the human species could be subdivided into various &quot;cultures&quot; that were in many cases distinct from one another. Usually, each of these cultures was seen as representing a different ethnicity. From an archaeological perspective, it was believed that each of these cultures could be distinguished because of its material culture, such as the style of pottery that it produced or the forms of burial that it practiced.

A number of culture-historical archaeologists subdivided and named separate cultures within their field of expertise: for instance, archaeologists working in the Aegean, in examining the Bronze Age period, divided it up between such cultures as Minoan, Helladic and Cycladic.

=== Diffusion and migration ===

Within culture-historical archaeology, changes in the culture of a historical society were typically explained by the diffusion of ideas from one culture into another, or by the migration of members of one society into a new area, sometimes by invasion. This was at odds with the theories held by cultural evolutionary archaeologists, who whilst accepting diffusion and migration as reasons for cultural change, also accepted the concept that independent cultural development could occur within a society, which was something culture-historical archaeologists typically refused to accept.

A number of culture-historical archaeologists put forward the idea that all knowledge and technology in the ancient world had diffused from a single source in the Middle East, which had then been spread across much of the world by merchants. The Australian Grafton Elliot Smith for instance, in his works &quot;The Children of the Sun&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Growth of Civilisation&quot; (1924), put forward the idea that agriculture, architecture, religion and government had all developed in Ancient Egypt, where the conditions were perfect for the development of such things, and that these ideas were then diffused into other cultures. A similar theory was proposed by Lord Raglan in 1939, but he believed Mesopotamia to be the source rather than Egypt.

=== Inductive reasoning ===

Culture history uses inductive reasoning unlike its main rival, processual archaeology which stresses the importance of the hypothetico-deduction method. To work best it requires a historical record to support it. As much of early archaeology focused on the Classical World it naturally came to rely on and mirror the information provided by ancient historians who could already explain many of the events and motivations which would not necessarily survive in the archaeological record. The need to explain prehistoric societies, without this historical record, could initially be dealt with using the paradigms established for later periods but as more and more material was excavated and studied, it became clear that culture history could not explain it all.

Manufacturing techniques and economic behaviour can be easily explained through cultures and culture history approaches but more complex events and explanations, involving less concrete examples in the material record are harder for it to explain. In order to interpret prehistoric religious beliefs for example, an approach based on cultures provides little to go on. Culture historians could catalogue items but in order to look beyond the material record, towards anthropology and the scientific method, they would have had to abandon their reliance on material, &#x27;inhuman,&#x27; cultures.
Such approaches were the intent of processual archaeology.

Culture history is by no means useless or surpassed by more effective methods of thinking. Indeed, diffusionist explanations are still valid in many cases and the importance of describing and classifying finds has not gone away. Post-processual archaeologists stress the importance of recurring patterns in material culture, echoing culture history&#x27;s approach. In many cases it can be argued that any explanation is only one factor within a whole network of influences.

== Criticism ==
Another criticism of this particular archaeological theory was that it often placed an emphasis on studying peoples from the Neolithic and later ages, somewhat ignoring the earliest human era, the Palaeolithic, where distinct cultural groups and differences are less noticeable in the archaeological record.

<doc id="642814" wikidata="Q834627" url="?curid=642814" title="White-faced starling">
<text>The white-faced starling (Sturnornis albofrontatus) is a member of the starling family of birds. It is an endemic resident breeder in Sri Lanka.

==Taxonomy==

The white-faced starling was formally described in 1854 by the English naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard under the binomial name &quot;Heterornis albofrontata&quot;. This species was previously placed in the genus &quot;Sturnus&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 found that the genus was polyphyletic. In the reoganization to create monotypic genera, the white-faced starling was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Sturnornis&quot; that had been introduced in 1879 by William Vincent Legge. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

For many years this species was erroneously believed to have been first described in 1850 by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte under the binomial name &quot;Pastor senex&quot;. Although Bonaparte had specified the location as Bengal, this was believed to have been an error. An examination in 1997 of the specimen used by Bonaparte revealed that his brief description applied to &quot;Sturnus sericeus&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1789, the red-billed starling. The earliest description of the white-faced starling is therefore that by Layard in 1854.

==Description==
The adults of these 22 cm-long birds have green-glossed dark grey upperparts and whitish underparts. The head is paler than the underparts. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller, with brown upperparts and greyer underparts.

This passerine is typically found in tall forest, usually high in the canopy. The white-faced starling builds its nest in a hole. The normal clutch is two eggs.

Like most starlings, the white-faced starling is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects.

<text>Pope Julian (Yulianus) of Alexandria was the 11th Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria.

He had advanced studies in the Bible. Considered a good leader, Julian was enthroned as Patriarch on the 9th Paremhat or the 17th of March in 178 AD. A synod of bishops, together with the laity, in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, appointed him patriarch. He composed homilies and sermons on the saints. He resided in the Cathedral of Saint Mark, the historical seat for the Patriarch of Alexandria.

After a reign of ten years, Julian died on the 8th of Paremhat, or on the 12th of Babah. He is commemorated in the Coptic &quot;Synaxarion&quot; on the 8th day of Paremhat.

<doc id="642836" wikidata="Q3135351" url="?curid=642836" title="Highlife (cellular automaton)">
<text>Highlife is a cellular automaton similar to Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. It was devised in 1994 by Nathan Thompson. It is a two-dimensional, two-state cellular automaton in the &quot;Life family&quot; and is described by the rule B36/S23; that is, a cell is born if it has 3 or 6 neighbors and survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors. Because the rules of HighLife and Conway&#x27;s Life (rule B3/S23) are similar, many simple patterns in Conway&#x27;s Life function identically in HighLife. More complicated engineered patterns for one rule, though, typically do not work in the other rule.

==Replicator==

The main reason for interest in HighLife comes from the existence of a pattern called the replicator. After running the replicator for twelve generations, the result is two replicators. The replicators will repeatedly reproduce themselves, all on a diagonal line. Whenever two replicators try to expand into each other, the pattern in the middle simply vanishes. The behavior of a row of Replicators interacting with each other in this way simulates the one-dimensional Rule 90 cellular automaton, where a single replicator simulates a nonzero cell of the Rule 90 automaton and a blank space where a replicator could be simulates a zero cell of Rule 90. Replicators can be used to engineer other more complex patterns, such as glider guns and high period oscillators.

A simple c/6 diagonal spaceship, found by Nathan Thompson, is known as the bomber. This pattern consists of a replicator and a blinker; after replicating itself into two replicators, one of the two new replicators reacts with the blinker to &quot;pull&quot; it forward to match the new position of the other new replicator. In this way, the whole pattern repeats with period 48.
It is also possible to make slower spaceships of much larger size that consist of a sequence of replicators between two ends composed of oscillators or still lifes, with the pattern of the replicators carefully chosen so that they interact with the ends of the pattern in such a way as to push the front end and pull the back end at the same speed.
Explicit examples of this design, known as &quot;basilisks&quot;, include spaceships of speeds formula_1 (one cell every 24 generations), formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4. A formula_1 basilisk gun has also been constructed.

It had been proven that replicators exist in Conway&#x27;s Life as well, before an explicit example was found in 2013.

<doc id="642840" wikidata="Q8021953" url="?curid=642840" title="Willimantic River">
<text>The Willimantic River is a tributary of the Shetucket River, approximately long in northeastern Connecticut in the New England region of the United States.

It is formed in northern Tolland County, near Stafford Springs by the confluence of Middle River and Furnace Brook. It flows south to the city of Willimantic, where it joins the Natchaug River to form the Shetucket. It is joined by the Hop River on the Coventry, Columbia, and Windham town border. The river is also designated as a National Recreation Trail.

== Name ==
The word &quot;Willimantic&quot; is of Algonquian origin, either Mohegan-Pequot or Narragansett. It is commonly translated as &quot;land of the swift running water&quot;, but the word more likely originally meant &quot;place near the evergreen swamp&quot;. The word was first attested in English writing as &quot;Waramanticut&quot; in 1684, and later as &quot;Wallamanticuk&quot;, &quot;Wewemantic&quot; and &quot;Weammantuck&quot; before being standardized as &quot;Willimantic&quot;.

== Geography ==
Shortly upstream from its confluence with the Natchaug, the Willimantic experiences a drop of ninety feet in one mile. The river powered textile mills from Stafford Springs to Willimantic, including the American Thread Company mill. None of these mills are operating as of 2007, having all been destroyed or converted to other uses such as apartment space.

A popular long paddling route begins south of Stafford Springs along Route 32 where the river is mostly quickwater all of the way to the flatwater of Eagleville Pond. The remainder is fairly easy going to the take-out at Route 66. Beware of the dam at the Route 275 bridge. Other access points may be at the N. River Road bridge, the Route 74 bridge, the Depot Rd bridge, the Route 195 bridge, the Jones Crossing bridge, the Merrow Road bridge, the U.S. Route 44 bridge, Brigham bridge, near the Route 275 dam, the Depot Rd bridge, the Route 31 bridge, and the Flanders Rd bridge.

<text>Antonio Mario Taguba (born October 31, 1950) is a retired major general in the United States Army. He was the second American citizen of Philippine birth to be promoted to general officer rank in the United States Army.

Taguba is best known for authoring the Taguba Report, an internal United States Army report on abuse of detainees held at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The report was leaked, then published, in 2004. Taguba again made national headlines in June 2008 when he accused the Bush administration of committing war crimes in a preface to a report by Physicians for Human Rights on prisoner abuse and torture in American military prisons.

==Early life==
Taguba was born in Sampaloc, Manila, Philippines, the city to which his family had moved from their home province of Cagayan. His father was a soldier in the 45th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Division (Philippine Scouts), who fought in the Battle of Bataan (January–April 1942) during World War II and, after capture by the Japanese, survived the Bataan Death March. Taguba was raised by his mother and grandmother. When he was 11 years old, his family moved to Hawaii, in the United States.

==Education==
Taguba graduated from Leilehua High School in Wahiawa, Hawaii, in 1968. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Idaho State University in 1972, and graduated from the Armor Officer Basic and Advanced Course, the Army Command and General Staff College, the College of Naval Command and Staff, and the Army War College.

In addition, Taguba holds a Master of Public Administration degree from Webster University, a Master of Arts degree in international relations from Salve Regina College, and a Master of Arts in national security and strategic studies from the College of Naval Command and Staff at the Naval War College.

==Military career==
Taguba was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1972. He served in Dongducheon, Republic of Korea, less than ten miles from North Korea in the Combat Support Company as the mortar platoon leader in 1974–1975 of the 1st Battalion, 72d Armor, 2nd Infantry Division, I Corps, Eighth Army.

At Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Taguba commanded the headquarters and headquarters battery, staff and faculty battalion, Field Artillery School/Center. He then served for three years in Germany, commanding a tank company in a mechanized infantry division at Mainz (Company B, 4th Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment).

Back in Korea, Taguba commanded the 1st Battalion, 72nd Armored Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Casey; and was the executive officer for plans and policy of the Republic of Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command in Yongsan.

At the Pentagon Taguba served as a material systems analyst, Office of the Chief of Staff, Army. At Fort Hood, Texas, he commanded the &quot;St. Lo,&quot; 2nd Brigade, 2nd Armored Division; when the brigade was transferred to the 4th Infantry Division, Colonel Taguba assumed command of the &quot;Warhorse,&quot; 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division from June 1995 until he transferred command in June 1997.

At Fort McPherson, Georgia, Taguba was chief of staff of the United States Army Reserve Command. At Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he was assistant division commander-forward of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) and Deputy Commanding General (South), First United States Army.

At Alexandria, Virginia, Taguba was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the United States Army Community and Family Support Center.

Major General Taguba served for ten months as deputy commanding general for support of the Third United States Army, United States Army Forces Central Command, Coalition Forces Land Component Command, based in Kuwait. Earlier, he was at the Pentagon as acting director of the Army Staff, Headquarters, Department of the Army, under General Eric K. Shinseki.

In 2004, Taguba was assigned to report on abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. In May of that year, he published an extremely critical report that was leaked to the public. Later that month, Major General Taguba was reassigned to the Pentagon to serve as deputy assistant secretary of defense for readiness, training and mobilization in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. Describing his thoughts upon being informed by John Abizaid a few weeks after the leak that he and his report would be investigated, Taguba said &quot;I&#x27;d been in the Army thirty-two years by then, and it was the first time that I thought I was in the Mafia.&quot;

In January 2006, General Richard A. Cody, the Army&#x27;s Vice-Chief of Staff, instructed Taguba to retire by the following January. No official explanation was given; Taguba himself believes his forced retirement was ordered by civilian Pentagon officials in retaliation for his report on abuse of prisoners. Taguba&#x27;s retirement, effective January 1, 2007, ended a 34-year career of military service.

==Work on prisoner abuse==

In 2004, Taguba was assigned to head an investigation into accusations of prisoner abuse in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Taguba became known worldwide when the Taguba Report, a classified, internal U.S. Army report on the investigation, was leaked to the public and published to national attention. The report was extremely critical of U.S. Army conduct and found widespread negligence and abuse.

In June 2008, Taguba was again in the headlines when he wrote the preface to a report by Physicians for Human Rights on prisoner abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib prison, in Guantanamo Bay, and in Afghanistan. In it, he accused the Bush administration of committing war crimes and called for the prosecution of those responsible. He wrote, &quot;There is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes. The only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account.&quot;

==Personal==
In the 2024 United States presidential election, Taguba endorsed Kamala Harris.

<text>Archidiptera is a suborder of Diptera under an alternative classification based largely on fossil taxa; it has not gained wide acceptance among non-paleontological dipterists. This is a sister group of Eudiptera (another suborder also based largely on fossil taxa).

Its sole living representative, the family Nymphomyiidae, is normally considered a member of the Blephariceromorpha within the Nematocera.

<text>Diane Duane (born May 18, 1952) is an American science fiction and fantasy author, long based in Ireland. Her works include the &quot;Young Wizards&quot; young adult fantasy series and the &quot;Rihannsu&quot; Star Trek novels.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, she grew up in Roosevelt, Long Island. After school, she studied nursing and practiced as a psychiatric nurse for two years until 1976, when she moved to California and worked as an assistant to David Gerrold. Her first novel was published by Dell Books in 1979; Gerrold wrote an &quot;overture&quot; to that novel, stating he&#x27;d rather be making overtures than introductions to Duane. She subsequently worked as a freelance writer. In 1981, she moved to Pennsylvania.

She married Northern Irish author Peter Morwood in 1987; they later moved to the United Kingdom and then to Ireland, where they reside in Grangecon, County Wicklow.

==Bibliography==
===Young Wizards===
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

A short story within the same universe, &quot;Uptown Local&quot;, has also been published as part of Jane Yolen&#x27;s &quot;Dragons and Dreams&quot; anthology, and a podcast of Duane reading it is freely available from her website. It also appears in the twentieth anniversary edition of &quot;So You Want to Be a Wizard&quot;.

In February 2011, Duane announced she would be releasing new versions of the first 4 books in the series, updating the technology used in the books, fixing some timeline issues within the series, and overall making the series more appealing to contemporary young adult readers. The first of the series would be available in June 2011, initially in ebook format, with the next three books to follow in the succeeding months and all these to have new ISBNs, with the publisher switching to the revised editions with new covers around the time the next book in the series is released.

===Feline Wizards===
The series, in the same setting as the Young Wizards novels, focuses on cat-wizards, who maintain the worldgates that wizards use for travel between the sheaf of canonical universes.
# (Published in the US as )

In December 2005, Duane proposed to her fans that they fund a third novel in the series, &quot;The Big Meow&quot;. After funding the project via whole-book subscriptions, per-chapter threshold pledges, merchandising, &quot;put something in the kitty&quot; donations, and $2,900 in challenge grants, Duane wrote, over a span of two and a half years, seven of the book&#x27;s 13 chapters. No new chapters were published between July 2008 and February 2011, but on February 2, 2011, Duane announced the project&#x27;s completion and posted the remaining chapters for subscribers between then and the 15th.

===Adult Wizards===
Books about adult wizards set in the same universe of the Young Wizards series.
* &quot;Theobroma&quot;, featured in the fantasy short story collection &quot;Wizards, Inc.&quot; (November 2007)

===Alternate Universes===
The Young Wizards universe contains canonical alternate universes (&quot;So You Want to Be a Wizard&quot; and &quot;To Visit the Queen&quot; are good examples: the protagonists travel to alternate universes to solve problems there).
* &quot;Stealing the Elf-King&#x27;s Roses&quot; () is set in a sheaf of universes originally mentioned in Nita&#x27;s studies in &quot;So You Want to Be a Wizard.&quot;

===The Middle Kingdoms===
Also known as the &quot;Tale of the Five&quot;, this high fantasy series was paused in 1992. The books center on some of the same themes as her better-known Young Wizards series; those who wield the Blue Fire have many of the same responsibilities as the wizards and fight the same battle against entropy. In &quot;So You Want to Be a Wizard&quot;, Nita&#x27;s wizardry manual is written by &quot;Hearnssen&quot;, a reference to the protagonist of &quot;The Door Into Fire&quot;, Herewiss s&#x27;Hearn (son of Hearn), so it may be that the Middle Kingdoms are part of the same sheaf of universes as the Young Wizards setting. Adding to this, one interdimensional portal in &quot;The Door into Fire&quot; appears to open over New York City. Duane is working on the final volume. &quot;The Door into Fire&quot; and &quot;The Door into Shadow&quot; have an omnibus reprint called &quot;Tale of Five: The Sword and the Dragon.&quot; ()
# &quot;The Door into Fire&quot; (1979)
# &quot;The Door into Shadow&quot; (1984)
# &quot;The Door into Sunset&quot; (1992)
# &quot;The Door into Starlight&quot; (to be written)

Several short stories are set in the Middle Kingdoms:
&quot;Parting Gifts&quot; (1981) and its prequel &quot;The Span&quot; (1999) featuring Sirronde; Duane plans to write a middle novella and publish the three together as &quot;Sirronde&#x27;s World&quot;.
&quot;Lior and the Sea&quot; (1985) is set in the world of the Middle Kingdoms, but not concerning any of the characters in the novels.

Duane also worked on &quot;Tales of the Five&quot;, a five-book series to bridge the gap between &quot;The Door into Sunset&quot; and &quot;The Door into Starlight&quot;. Books in this series so far are:
* &quot;The Levin-Gad&quot; (2018)
* &quot;The Landlady&quot; (2019)
* &quot;The Librarian&quot; (TBA)

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
Duane has also written a number of &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels:

* Original Series
** 
** (omnibus, containing &quot;Spock&#x27;s World&quot; and A. C. Crispin&#x27;s &quot;Sarek&quot;)
* &quot;Rihannsu&quot;
** (co-written with husband Peter Morwood)
** 
** An omnibus of the first four Rihannsu novels, containing minor tweaks for consistency and re-editing &quot;Swordhunt&quot; and &quot;Honor Blade&quot; into the originally-intended single novel.
* Next Generation
**

===Other prose works===
Duane made available in various e-formats a previously unpublished book which was sold to at least two European publishers, but never actually brought out due to internal restructuring at one publishing house (Corgi) and the sale of another (Heyne Verlag). The novel, &quot;A Wind from the South&quot;, is the first of a projected trilogy telling the story of a young girl born in the 11th century in a remote region of the Alps. This girl slowly discovers that she is the intended physical avatar of an exiled Roman goddess, while (as she grows) she becomes caught up in the political turmoil of William Tell&#x27;s time.

Duane was also responsible for prose adaptations of several scripts from &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. She has also written numerous short stories, about equally divided between fantasy and science fiction, which have appeared in various anthologies and collections over the last twenty years. She also wrote the 1985 text adventure video game &quot;Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative&quot;.

=== Maps ===

Duane drew the map in Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot;.

==Screen works: film and television==
Duane has worked in television since the early 1980s, initially becoming involved in script work at the Hanna-Barbera animation studio (now Cartoon Network). After writing numerous scripts for such series as &quot;Scooby and Scrappy-Doo&quot;, &quot;Captain Caveman&quot;, &quot;Space Stars&quot;, &quot;Fonz and the Happy Days Gang&quot;, &quot;Biskitts&quot;, and &quot;Laverne and Shirley in the Army&quot;, she moved on to work in development and serve as a staff writer at Filmation, and in 1985 was hired to story-edit the DiC animated series &quot;Dinosaucers&quot;. During this period she also wrote scripts for Sunbow Productions (&quot;Glo Friends&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, and &quot;My Little Pony&quot;) and Walt Disney Productions (&quot;Duck Tales&quot;). In 1986, she co-wrote (with Michael Reaves) the script of one of the earliest episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot;.

In the early 1990s Duane was brought on board as the head writer on the BBC Television educational series &quot;Science Challenge&quot;. Shortly thereafter she co-wrote (with her husband) scripts for &quot;&quot; and for &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. She also wrote the screenplay for the 1996 space adventure game &quot;Privateer 2: The Darkening&quot;, which starred Clive Owen, Christopher Walken, Jürgen Prochnow and Mathilda May. Other screen work from that period includes the screenplay for the &quot;Space Island One&quot; episode &quot;Not In My Back Yard&quot; (1998–1999).

In 2003, after doing nearly four years&#x27; development work with the production company Tandem Communications of Munich, Germany, Duane and Peter Morwood co-wrote the script for the German TV miniseries &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;. The miniseries aired in Germany on the Sat.1 network in late November 2004, and a feature version (titled &quot;Sword of Xanten&quot;) screened in the UK in December 2004. A &quot;megafeature&quot; cut of the entire miniseries was aired on Channel Four television in the UK in December 2005. The miniseries aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in the US in late March 2006 under the title &quot;Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King&quot;. The miniseries has also been released on DVD in the US and numerous other markets, under various titles (the previous US title was &quot;Curse of the Ring&quot;).

Duane was also a co-author of the Barbie movie &quot;&quot;.

An adaptation of &quot;So You Want to be a Wizard&quot; is currently in the works.

<doc id="642850" wikidata="Q2079471" url="?curid=642850" title="Self-signed certificate">
<text>In cryptography and computer security, self-signed certificates are public key certificates that are not issued by a certificate authority (CA). These self-signed certificates are easy to make and do not cost money. However, they do not provide any trust value. 

For instance, if a website owner uses a self-signed certificate to provide HTTPS services, people who visit that website cannot be certain that they are connected to their intended destination. For all they know, a malicious third-party could be redirecting the connection using another self-signed certificate bearing the same holder name. The connection is still encrypted, but does not necessarily lead to its intended target. In comparison, a certificate signed by a trusted CA prevents this attack because the user&#x27;s web browser separately validates the certificate against the issuing CA. The attacker&#x27;s certificate fails this validation.

== Benefits ==
Self-signed certificates can be created for free, using a wide variety of tools including OpenSSL, Java&#x27;s keytool, Adobe Reader, wolfSSL and Apple&#x27;s Keychain. They are easy to customize; e.g, they can have larger key sizes or hold additional metadata. Their use doesn&#x27;t involve the problems of trusting third parties that may improperly sign certificates. Self-signed certificate transactions usually present a far smaller attack surface by eliminating both the complex certificate chain validation, and certificate revocation checks like CRL and OCSP.

==Trust issues==

In a CA-based PKI system, parties engaged in secure communication must trust a CA, i.e. place the CA certificates in a whitelist of trusted certificates. Developers of web browsers may use procedures specified by the CA/Browser Forum to whitelist well-known, public certificate authorities. Individual groups and companies may whitelist additional, private CA certificates. The trust issues of an entity accepting a new self-signed certificate are similar to the issues of an entity trusting the addition of a new CA certificate. The parties in a self-signed PKI must establish trust with each other (using procedures outside the PKI), and confirm the accurate transfer of public keys e.g. compare the certificate&#x27;s cryptographic hash out of band.

There are many subtle differences between CA signed and self-signed certificates, especially in the amount of trust that can be placed in the security assertions of the certificate. Some CAs can verify the identity of the person to whom they issue a certificate; for example the US military issues their Common Access Cards in person, with multiple forms of other ID. The CA can attest identity values like these by including them in the signed certificate. The entity that validates the certificate can trust the information in that certificate, to the same extent that they trust the CA that signed it (and by implication, the security procedures the CA used to verify the attested information).

With a self-signed certificate by contrast, trust of the values in the certificate are more complicated because the entity possesses the signing key, and can always generate a new certificate with different values. For example, the validity dates of a self-signed certificate might not be trusted because the entity could always create and sign a new certificate that contained a valid date range.

The values in a self-signed certificate can only be trusted when the values were verified out-of-band during the acceptance of the certificate, and there is a method to verify the self-signed certificate has not changed after it was trusted. For example, the procedure of trusting a self-signed certificate includes a manual verification of validity dates, and a hash of the certificate is incorporated into the white list. When the certificate is presented for an entity to validate, they first verify the hash of the certificate matches the reference hash in the white-list, and if they match (indicating the self-signed certificate is the same as the one that was formerly trusted) then the certificate&#x27;s validity dates can be trusted. Special treatment of X.509 certificate fields for self-signed certificate can be found in RFC 3280.

Revocation of self-signed certificates differs from CA-signed certificates. By nature, no entity (CA or others) can revoke a self-signed certificate. But one could invalidate a self-signed CA by removing it from the trust whitelist.

== Uses ==
Self-signed certificates have limited uses, e.g. in the cases where the issuer and the sole user are the same entity. For example, the Encrypting File System on Microsoft Windows issues a self-signed certificate on behalf of a user account to transparently encrypt and decrypt files on the fly. Another example is a root certificate, which is a form of self-signed certificate.

== Name Confusion ==
The terms &quot;self-signed&quot; and &quot;self-issued&quot; are occasionally used interchangeably and &quot;self-signed certificate&quot; is sometimes even incorrectly used to indicate a certificate issued by a private (not publicly trusted) CA.

RFC 5280 defines self-signed certificates as &quot;self-issued certificates where the digital signature may be verified by the public key bound into the certificate&quot; whereas a self-issued certificate is a certificate &quot;in which the issuer and subject are the same entity&quot;. While in the strict sense the RFC makes this definition only for CA certificates, there is no reason to also adopt that definition for end-entity certificates.

<text>Eudiptera is a suborder of Diptera under an alternative subordinal classification based largely on fossil taxa; it has not gained wide acceptance among non-paleontological dipterists and is presented here for comparative purposes only. The suborder is the sister group of Archidiptera (another group also largely based on fossil taxa).

All of the taxa included in Eudiptera are also members of the Nematocera, and the latter is the preferred grouping; both are paraphyletic.

<text>There have been four railway accidents at Potters Bar in England. Those in 1898 and 1946 were signals passed at danger. The accident in 2002 led to substantial public debate and a national change in policy relating to maintenance of infrastructure.

==1898==
On 19 March 1898, the 7:50 p.m train from Hatfield to King&#x27;s Cross ran past the signals at danger when it reached Potters Bar. The train cut through the catch points and buffers and crashed onto the platform. The front part of the engine was smashed and the leading coach wrecked. No one was killed. The driver, fireman and guard narrowly escaped injury. Some passengers complained of being shaken but were able to go home.

==1899==
On 16 May 1899, the Earl of Strafford was killed at Potters Bar railway station when he was hit by an express train. Witnesses said that he appeared to step in front of the train from the bottom of the slope at the end of the platform; he was carried for 50 yards (46 m). The coroner&#x27;s court investigated his medical conditions, as he was prone to catalepsy. The possibility of suicide was also considered. A finding of suicide would have had substantial social and legal implications. The jury returned a verdict that the death was due to misadventure.

==1946==

On 10 February 1946, a local passenger train travelling towards King&#x27;s Cross hit buffers at Potters Bar station. Derailed carriages fouled the main lines. Two express trains travelling in opposite directions then hit the wreckage. Two passengers were killed and 17 injured were taken to hospital. The driver of the local train was found to have misidentified a poorly placed main-line signal as applying to his own line. It was thought probable that he had been misled by the signal applying to his line showing clear when he first saw it (though changing against him shortly afterwards). The signalman was found to have contributed to the accident by changing a set of points as the train passed over them.

==2002==
On 10 May 2002, a northbound train derailed at high speed, killing seven and injuring 76. Part of the train ended up wedged between the station platforms and building structures.

===Event===
A West Anglia Great Northern train service left King&#x27;s Cross station at 12:45 heading for King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk, via Cambridge. At 12:55, travelling at , the four-coach Class 365 Electric multiple unit (unit number: 365526) passed over a set of points &quot;2182A&quot; just south of Potters Bar station. The points moved under the train, causing the rear bogie of the third coach and the entire fourth carriage to derail. This caused the fourth coach to become detached and cross onto the adjacent line where it flipped into the air. 

The momentum threw the carriage into the station, where one end of the carriage struck Darkes Lane bridge parapet, destroying the masonry and sending debris onto the road below. It then mounted the platform and slid along before coming to rest under the platform canopy at 45 degrees. The front three coaches remained on the tracks and came to a stop approximately north of the station due to an automatic application of the brakes.

Six of the victims were travelling in the train, while a seventh, Agnes Quinlivan, was killed by the masonry falling from the bridge over Darkes Lane.

===Investigation===
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) report released in May 2003 found that the points were poorly maintained and that this was the principal cause of the accident. The bolts that held the stretcher bars that maintain the distance between the two point blades had come loose or gone missing, causing the point blades to move apart when the train passed over them. The points had been fully inspected on 1 May by a team working for the private railway maintenance firm Jarvis plc and there had been a further visual inspection on 9 May the day before the crash, with no problems reported.

However, that evening, a West Anglia Great Northern station announcer was travelling on the down fast line and reported a &quot;rough ride&quot; at Potters Bar whilst going over that same place on the track, points &quot;2182A&quot;. A Railtrack engineering supervisor was sent to make an inspection, but due to an apparent misunderstanding by the King&#x27;s Cross signal box staff, he was sent to the wrong line, the up fast line, to check the track and points and did not find the &quot;loose nuts&quot; that subsequently led to the accident.

Initially after the accident, Jarvis claimed that the points&#x27; poor condition was due to sabotage of some sort, and that its maintenance was not to blame. No solid evidence of any sabotage has ever come to light, and the HSE report found that other sets of points in the Potters Bar area showed similar, less-serious maintenance deficiencies and the poor state of maintenance &quot;probably arose from a failure to understand fully the design and safety requirements&quot;.

Further investigations by the HSE found that heavy and constant vibrations on the stretcher bars and their bolts caused them in turn to vibrate and oscillate until their nuts fell off the bolts. These have since been replaced by two-part locking nuts instead of the main nuts having half-size locking nuts to hold them in place.

In November 2010, the Office of Rail Regulation said Network Rail and Jarvis Rail would be charged under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The case was heard at Watford Magistrates&#x27; Court in February 2011.

===Aftermath===
The tragedy sparked a debate about whether private maintenance firms were paying too little attention to training and safety. In 2003, Network Rail announced it was taking all track maintenance in-house, ending the use of private contractors except for large-scale renewal or development projects.

On 28 April 2004, Jarvis sent a letter to the victims&#x27; families, admitting liability for the accident. The company said that it would formally accept &quot;legally justified claims&quot; after making a financial provision of £3,000,000.

In the letter Kevin Hyde, chief executive, wrote:

In the aftermath of the crash, when Jarvis was under great pressure to explain itself, we were drawn into a debate about the possible causes of the crash. On behalf of the company and my colleagues, I would like to apologise for the hurt and anger our actions in responding caused.

A circular memorial plate was erected on platform 3 of the station, dedicated to the seven fatalities of the Potters Bar crash.

On 13 May 2011, Network Rail was fined £3 million for safety failings related to the crash.

===List of people killed===

Except for Agnes Quinlivan, a nearby pedestrian, all other fatalities were in the rear carriage of the train.

* Austen Kark, 75 (husband of writer Nina Bawden, who was injured during the accident)
* Emma Knights, 29
* Chia-hsin Lin, 29

<doc id="642856" wikidata="Q139654" url="?curid=642856" title="Baie-Comeau">
<text>Baie-Comeau () is a city in the Côte-Nord region of the province of Quebec, Canada. It is located on the shores of the St. Lawrence River, and is the seat of Manicouagan Regional County Municipality. It is near the mouth of the Manicouagan River, named after the adjacent Comeau Bay. It has a population of 20,687 in the 2021 Canadian census, and the census agglomeration population is 26,643.

Baie-Comeau is the birthplace of Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada.

==Toponymy==
Although the city is officially named in honour of Napoléon-Alexandre Comeau, the origin of the name actually comes from his father Antoine-Alexandre Comeau, who was an employee of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and had a camp there. Travelers would spontaneously think of “the bay of the Comeau camp”, perpetuated by word of mouth until the employees of the Geography Commission wrote &quot;Anse à Comeau&quot; (Comeau Cove) on plans. When Baie-Comeau was founded however, the authorities were unaware of the origin of this name, and specified that it honored Napoléon-Alexandre Comeau (1848-1923).

==History==
The oldest part of Baie-Comeau is the area known as &quot;Vieux-Poste&quot; (Old Post) near the mouth of the Amédée River where in 1889, the Saint-Eugène-de-Manicouagan Mission was founded by Eudists. In 1898, the first sawmill in the Côte-Nord region was built there by the brothers Damase and Henri Jalbert, but it closed in 1907 after their timber stock was swept into the St. Lawrence. In 1916, Route 138 was extended to Saint-Eugène-de-Manicouagan and in 1929, its post office opened with the English name of (francized in 1936).

Baie-Comeau itself (the eastern part of the current town) was founded in 1936 when a paper mill was constructed by Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Arthur A. Schmon oversaw the project, which included a power station and housing. Experiencing remarkable growth, the Town of Baie-Comeau was incorporated on May 20, 1937. Coinciding with the completion of the mill, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company opened a store on September 15 of that same year. It was the first HBC small department store in Quebec. The area continued to see economic development with the establishment of the hydro-electric power stations on the Manicouagan and Outardes Rivers beginning with the Chutes-aux-Outardes Station in 1952, an aluminum smelter in 1958, and grain warehouses (the largest in Canada) in 1959.

In 1950, the village of Saint-Eugène-de-Manicouagan was incorporated as the Municipality of Hauterive. In June 1982, Hauterive was merged into Baie-Comeau, taking effect on January 1, 1983. The HBC closed its Baie-Comeau store in 1986.

Baie-Comeau is the seat of the judicial district of Baie-Comeau.

==Geography==
Baie-Comeau is located on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River, about northeast of Quebec City and southwest of Sept-Îles. 

There are two urban area population centres within the city limits: Baie-Comeau proper, with a population of 9,100, and Hauterive, with a population of 11,147, in an area of and a density of , as of the 2021 Canadian census. 

Baie-Comeau is crossed by five rivers: the Manicouagan River, the Amédée River, the Petit-Bras River, the Chasse River, and the English River. These rivers are fed by around thirty lakes.

===Climate===
Although at the same latitude as Vancouver or Paris, Baie-Comeau has a borderline humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), just above the subarctic climate. The cold Labrador Current makes the Gulf of St. Lawrence very cold and tends to cool the weather during summer much more than the marginal warming of the winters resulting from its maritime location. With the moist northeasterly winds coming in from the Icelandic Low, snowfall is very heavy, averaging around per year with a greatest average depth of around in March. The extreme snow depth was on January 10, 1969.
==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Baie-Comeau had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


Knowledge of official languages from 2016 (multiple answers were possible):
* English: 4,415
* French: 20,840
* Other languages: 550

==Economy==
The region is a major forestry centre for the pulp and paper industry, owned by Abitibi Consolidated as of October 2006. Alongside hydro-electricity and the paper industry, an aluminum plant has fed employment for decades. Cargill has a large elevator there that is used to transfer grain from Great Lakes boats to ocean-going ships.

==Local government==
The Baie-Comeau city council consists of the mayor of Baie-Comeau and eight elected city councillors, four from each of the two sectors of town. One recent mayor of Baie-Comeau was Yves Montigny, who was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec in the 2022 Quebec general election; Michel Desbiens became mayor in 2023.

List of former mayors:

* Ivo Di Piazza (...–2009)
* Christine Brisson (2009–2013)
* Claude Martel (2013–2017)
* Yves Montigny {2017–2022)
* Serge Deschenes (interim, 2022)
* Carole Deschênes (deputy mayor, 2022)
* Michel Desbiens (2023–present)

==Transportation==

The town is along Route 138 about east of Forestville and about west of Sept-Îles. A ferry service of the Société des traversiers du Québec and rail ferry service of the COGEMA also links the town to Matane on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. The town is the southern terminus of Route 389, which leads to the Daniel-Johnson Dam, the town of Fermont, and the Labrador region of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

<text>The Brachycera are a suborder of the order Diptera. It is a major suborder consisting of around 120 families. Their most distinguishing characteristic is reduced antenna segmentation.

==Description==
A summary of the main physical characteristics is:

* Antenna size (with eight or fewer flagellomeres) is reduced. In many species the third segment, the flagellum, is fused, except from a bristle called the arista that is sticking out from the fused flagellum. The arista consist of no more than three segments called aristomeres.
* The maxillary palp (an elongated appendage near the mouth) has two segments or fewer.
* The back portions of the larval head capsule extend into the prothorax (the anterior part of the thorax, which bears the first pair of legs).
* Two distinct parts make up of the larval mandible (lower jaw).
* The epandrium and hypandrium of the genitalia are separated in males.
* No premandible is present on the lower surface of the labrum (the roof of the mouth).
* The configuration of the CuA2 and A1 wing veins is distinct.

Brachyceran flies can also be distinguished through behavior. Many of the species are predators or scavengers.

==Classification==
The structure of subgroups within the Brachycera is a source of much confusion and controversy; many of the names used historically (e.g., Orthorrhapha) have not been used in decades, but still persist in textbooks, checklists, faunal catalogs, and other sources. Additionally, most recent classifications no longer use the Linnaean ranks for taxa (e.g., the Tree of Life Web Project), and this creates its own set of problems.

<text>Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes (; 10 September 1788 – 5 August 1868), sometimes referred to as Boucher de Perthes ( ), was a French archaeologist and antiquary notable for his discovery, in about 1830, of flint tools in the gravels of the Somme valley.

==Life==

Born at Rethel, in the Ardennes, he was the eldest son of Jules Armand Guillaume Boucher de Crèvecœur, botanist and customs officer, and of Étienne-Jeanne-Marie de Perthes (whose surname he was authorised by royal decree in 1818 to assume in addition to his father&#x27;s). In 1802 he entered government employ as an officer of customs. His duties kept him for six years in Italy, but upon his returning in 1811 he found rapid promotion at home, and finally was appointed, in March 1825, to succeed his father as director of the douane (customs office) at Abbeville, where he remained for the rest of his life.

==Boucher de Perthes as an archaeologist==

His leisure time was chiefly devoted to the study of what was afterwards called the Stone Age and antediluvian man, as he expressed it. About the year 1830 he had found, in the gravels of the Somme valley, flints which in his opinion bore evidence of human handiwork; but not until many years afterwards did he make public the important discovery of a worked flint implement with remains of elephant and rhinoceros in the gravels of Menchecourt. This was in 1846.

In 1847 he commenced the issue of his monumental three volume work, , a work in which he was the first to establish the existence of man in the Pleistocene or early Quaternary period. His views met with little approval, partly because he had previously propounded theories regarding the antiquity of man without facts to support them, partly because the figures in his book were badly executed and they included drawings of flints which showed no clear sign of workmanship.

In 1855 Dr Marcel Jérôme Rigollot of Amiens strongly advocated the authenticity of the flint implements; but it was not until 1858 that Hugh Falconer saw the collection at Abbeville and induced Sir Joseph Prestwich in the following year to visit the locality. Prestwich then definitely agreed that the flint implements were the work of man, and that they occurred in undisturbed ground in association with remains of extinct mammalia.

Charles Lyell not only confirmed the enormous geological time periods of the stratifications, but indicated that the chalk plateau of Picardy, France had once been connected to the chalk lands of Kent, England and that the Strait of Dover or Pas de Calais was the recent result of very long term complex erosion forces.

In 1863 his discovery of a human jaw, together with worked flints, in a gravel-pit at Moulin-Quignon near Abbeville seemed to vindicate Boucher de Perthes entirely; but doubt was thrown on the antiquity of the human remains (owing to the possibility of interment), though not on the good faith of the discoverer, who was the same year made an officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. However, the &#x27;Moulin-Quigon jaw&#x27; was a hoax, planted by one of Boucher de Perthes&#x27; workers in response to an offer of a reward of 200 Francs for findings of human remains.

Although Boucher de Perthes was the first to establish that Europe had been populated by early man, he was not able to pinpoint the precise period, because the scientific frame of reference did not then exist. Today the hand axes of the Somme River district are widely accepted to be at least 500,000 years old and thus the product of Neanderthal populations, while some authorities think they may be as old as one million years and therefore associated with &quot;Homo erectus&quot;.

==Other works==

Boucher de Perthes displayed activity in many other directions. For more than thirty years he filled the presidential chair of the Société d&#x27;Émulation at Abbeville, to the publications of which he contributed articles on a wide range of subjects. He was the author of several tragedies, two books of fiction, several works of travel, and a number of books on economic and philanthropic questions.

==Aftermath==

In 1954, the Museum Boucher de Perthes was opened in Abbeville, with collections covering a wide range of materials and periods.

In his novel &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1864), Jules Verne makes reference to Boucher de Perthes after Professor Lindenbrock, Axel and, Hans discover &quot;antediluvian&quot; human heads on a beach near the center of the earth.

<text>The Earthling is a 1980 American-Australian adventure film directed by Peter Collinson, and starring William Holden and Ricky Schroder. It was filmed in Australia in 1979, and was the last to be directed by Collinson before his death the following year.

==Cast==
* William Holden as Patrick Foley
* Ricky Schroder as Shawn Dailey
* Olivia Hamnett as Bettina Dailey

==Plot==

Patrick Foley is a jaded loner who has been a drifter for much of his life. Discovering he has terminal cancer, he decides to return to the Australian outback where he grew up to die in solitude. His plans are interrupted however when ten year old Shawn Dailey&#x27;s parents die in a horrific accident leaving the boy alone and helpless. Reluctantly, Foley teaches the boy survival and they eventually bond in love before Foley dies and Shawn begins his trek back to civilisation.

==Production==
The film was shot from September to October 1979 in the Blue Mountains, Barrington Forest and Warrumbungle National Park. It was reported that Holden and Schroder got along while filming. Schroder named one of his children Holden in honour of his co-star.

Briann Kearney was assistant to the director.

==Reception==
The film drew greatly mixed reviews, with some critics reviling it, while others praised it. It played to little notice in theatres, but later became something of a daytime staple on HBO and other cable-movie channels in the 1980s. It grossed $72,000 for box office in Australia.

<text>An archaeological culture is a recurring assemblage of types of artifacts, buildings and monuments from a specific period and region that may constitute the material culture remains of a particular past human society. The connection between these types is an empirical observation. Their interpretation in terms of ethnic or political groups is based on archaeologists&#x27; understanding. However, this is often subject to long-unresolved debates. The concept of the archaeological culture is fundamental to culture-historical archaeology.

==Concept== 

Different cultural groups have material culture items that differ both functionally and aesthetically due to varying cultural and social practices. This notion is observably true on the broadest scales. For example, the equipment associated with the brewing of tea varies greatly across the world. Social relations to material culture often include notions of identity and status.

Advocates of culture-historical archaeology use the notion to argue that sets of material culture can be used to trace ancient groups of people that were either self-identifying societies or ethnic groups. Archaeological culture is a classifying device to order archaeological data, focused on artifacts as an expression of culture rather than people. The classic definition of this idea comes from Gordon Childe:
The concept of an archaeological culture was crucial to linking the typological analysis of archaeological evidence to mechanisms that attempted to explain why they change through time. The key explanations favoured by culture-historians were the diffusion of forms from one group to another or the migration of the peoples themselves. A simplistic example of the process might be that if one pottery-type had handles very similar to those of a neighbouring type but decoration similar to a different neighbour, the idea for the two features might have diffused from the neighbours. Conversely, if one pottery-type suddenly replaces a great diversity of pottery types in an entire region, that might be interpreted as a new group migrating in with this new style.

This idea of culture is known as normative culture. It relies on the assumption found in the view of archaeological culture that artifacts found are &quot;an expression of cultural norms,&quot; and that these norms define culture. This view is also required to be , multiple artifacts must be found for a site to be classified under a specific archaeological culture. One trait alone does not result in a culture, rather a combination of traits are required.

This view culture gives life to the artifacts themselves. &quot;Once &#x27;cultures&#x27; are regarded as things, it is possible to attribute behavior to them, and to talk about them as if they were living organisms.&quot;

Archaeological cultures were equated separate &#x27;peoples&#x27; (ethnic groups or races) leading in some cases to distinct nationalist archaeologies.

Most archaeological cultures are named after either the type artifact or type site that defines the culture. For example, cultures may be named after pottery types such as Linear Pottery culture or Funnelbeaker culture. More frequently, they are named after the site at which the culture was first defined such as the Hallstatt culture or Clovis culture.

Since the term &quot;culture&quot; has many different meanings, scholars have also coined a more specific term paleoculture, as a specific designation for prehistoric cultures. Critics argue that cultural taxonomies lack a strong consensus on the epistemological aims of cultural taxonomy,

==Development==
The use of the term &quot;culture&quot; entered archaeology through 19th-century German ethnography, where the &quot;Kultur&quot; of tribal groups and rural peasants was distinguished from the &quot;Zivilisation&quot; of urbanised peoples. In contrast to the broader use of the word that was introduced to English-language anthropology by Edward Burnett Tylor, &quot;Kultur&quot; was used by German ethnologists to describe the distinctive ways of life of a particular people or &quot;Volk&quot;, in this sense equivalent to the French &quot;civilisation&quot;. Works of &quot;Kulturgeschichte&quot; (culture history) were produced by a number of German scholars, particularly Gustav Klemm, from 1780 onwards, reflecting a growing interest in ethnicity in 19th-century Europe.

The first use of &quot;culture&quot; in an archaeological context was in Christian Thomsen&#x27;s 1836 work &quot;Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed&quot; (). In the later half of the 19th century archaeologists in Scandinavia and central Europe increasingly made use of the German concept of culture to describe the different groups they distinguished in the archaeological record of particular sites and regions, often alongside and as a synonym of &quot;civilisation&quot;. It was not until the 20th century and the works of German prehistorian and fervent nationalist Gustaf Kossinna that the idea of archaeological cultures became central to the discipline. Kossinna saw the archaeological record as a mosaic of clearly defined cultures (or &quot;Kultur-Gruppen&quot;, culture groups) that were strongly associated with race. He was particularly interested in reconstructing the movements of what he saw as the direct prehistoric ancestors of Germans, Slavs, Celts and other major Indo-European ethnic groups in order to trace the Aryan race to its homeland or &quot;Urheimat&quot;.

The strongly racist character of Kossinna&#x27;s work meant it had little direct influence outside of Germany at the time (the Nazi Party enthusiastically embraced his theories), or at all after World War II. However, the more general &quot;culture history&quot; approach to archaeology that he began did replace social evolutionism as the dominant paradigm for much of the 20th century. Kossinna&#x27;s basic concept of the archaeological culture, stripped of its racial aspects, was adopted by Vere Gordon Childe and Franz Boas, at the time the most influential archaeologists in Britain and America respectively. Childe, in particular, was responsible for formulating the definition of archaeological culture that is still largely applies today. He defined archaeological culture as artifacts and remains that consistently occur together. This introduced a &quot;new and discrete usage of the term which was significantly different from current anthropological usage.&quot; His definition in particular was purely a classifying device to order the archaeological data.

Though he was sceptical about identifying particular ethnicities in the archaeological record and inclined much more to diffusionism than migrationism to explain culture change, Childe and later culture-historical archaeologists, like Kossinna, still equated separate archaeological cultures with separate &quot;peoples&quot;. Later archaeologists have questioned the straightforward relationship between material culture and human societies. The definition of archaeological cultures and their relationship to past people has become less clear; in some cases, what was believed to be a monolithic culture is shown by further study to be discrete societies. For example, the Windmill Hill culture now serves as a general label for several different groups that occupied southern Great Britain during the Neolithic. Conversely, some archaeologists have argued that some supposedly distinctive cultures are manifestations of a wider culture, but they show local differences based on environmental factors such as those related to Clactonian man. Conversely, archaeologists may make a distinction between material cultures that actually belonged to a single cultural group. It has been highlighted, for example, that village-dwelling and nomadic Bedouin Arabs have radically different material cultures even if in other respects, they are very similar. In the past, such synchronous findings were often interpreted as representing intrusion by other groups.

==Criticism==
The concept of archaeological cultures is itself a divisive subject within the archaeological field. When first developed, archaeologic culture was viewed as a reflection of actual human culture. 

This view of culture would be &quot;entirely satisfactory if the aim of archaeology was solely the definition and description of these entities.&quot; However, as the 1960s rolled around and archaeology sought to be more scientific, archaeologists wanted to do more than just describe artifacts, and the archaeological culture found.

Accusations came that archaeological culture was &quot;idealist&quot; as it assumes that norms and ideas are seen as being &quot;important in the definition of cultural identity.&quot; It stresses the particularity of cultures: &quot;Why and how they are different from the adjacent group.&quot; Processualists, and other subsequently critics of cultural-historical archaeology argued that archaeological culture treated culture as &quot;just a rag-tag assemblage of ideas.&quot;

Archaeological culture is presently useful for sorting and assembling artifacts, especially in European archaeology that often falls towards culture-historical archaeology.

<text>Jonathan G. Lebed (born September 29, 1984) is an American businessman and former stock trader who reached an out-of-court civil settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at age 15 for stock manipulation.

==Early life and education==
Lebed was raised in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, and graduated from Cedar Grove High School.

==Career==
Between September 1999 and February 2000, Lebed made hundreds of thousands of dollars from using a computer in his bedroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, using pump and dump by posting in internet chat rooms and message boards, encouraging people to buy penny stocks he already owned, thus, according to the SEC, artificially raising the price of the stock. Between September 1999 and February 2000, his smallest one-day gain was US$12,000, while his biggest was $74,000. Lebed became the first minor prosecuted by the SEC. In 2001, Lebed and the SEC negotiated an out-of-court settlement in which Lebed forfeited $285,000 in profit and interest he had made on 11 trades without admitting any wrongdoing, allowing him to keep close to half a million dollars.

In 2003, Lebed was an unsuccessful candidate for the Cedar Grove township council.

Lebed&#x27;s legal issues were profiled in an episode of the 2001 BBC documentary &quot;The Future Just Happened&quot;.

In 2010, he was living in Wayne, New Jersey, and was the sole owner of Lebed Biz LLC, which runs a website touting penny stocks. In 2008, a company won a $2.56 million judgment against Lebed.

<doc id="642873" wikidata="Q274033" url="?curid=642873" title="Reni Jusis">
<text>Reni Jusis (born March 29, 1974, in Konin, raised in Mielno) is a Polish pop singer, songwriter and producer. At first, Jusis recorded R&amp;B music, which evolved into electronic dance style in later albums. After ten years of her career, she recorded piano pop music.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

Reni Jusis began performing on stage early as a child. Her first success was winning a local vacation song contest. Later she performed in one of the most popular child groups in Poland, .

Jusis is musically educated. First she took piano lessons in music elementary school and music high school. In 1993, she performed in the musical &quot;Fatamorgana&quot; (&quot;Mirage&quot;) with the music of her school friend Adam Sztaba at the Baltycki Teatr Dramatyczny in Koszalin. It was the first step in her career, because there she was discovered by music producer and later rapper Yaro.

Yaro offered Reni the chance to be a backing vocalist in his rock band and later he toured with her. They also were a couple. Finally Yaro changed the band&#x27;s line-up and style. He began making rap music and Reni sang refrains in his songs. They were a support act for the most popular rapper in Poland, Liroy. Thanks to him they met world-famous Polish jazz musician Michal Urbaniak who took them under his artistic care. Together they even created a few songs, but they never were released. Still, Urbaniak recommended Jusis to Polish record companies which brought about her record contract with Polish division of EMI Music. In 1997 Yaro and Reni published the album &quot;Yazzda&quot;, with smash hit &quot;Rowery dwa&quot; (&quot;Two Bikes&quot;).

=== Solo debut ===

After that success Yaro began work on Reni&#x27;s solo debut album, which was released next year. The first effect was massive hit &quot;Zakrecona&quot; (&quot;Twisted&quot;), which gave title for her album. It was released with a mixture of R&amp;B, funk and hip-hop music. All songs were written by Reni mainly with Yaro. In that year Jusis also graduated in choir conducting from the Academy of Music in Poznań. In 1999 the album &quot;Zakrecona&quot; earned 3 awards of Polish Music Industry Fryderyk Awards for: Best Debut Of The Year, Best Song Of The Year and Best Rap/Hip-Hop Album Of The Year. Reni gained fame and respect of the music industry. Unfortunately artistic and private conflicts caused the end of the collaboration and relationship between Yaro and Reni.

Her second album &quot;Era Renifera&quot; (&quot;Era of the Reindeer&quot; – a play on words, because word &quot;reindeer&quot; in Polish contains Reni&#x27;s name) from 1999 also was a mixture of black rhythms, but this time with the addition of reggae. She produced the whole album herself, and also composed and wrote most of the songs. This album contained the very popular cover of 10CC hit &quot;Dreadlock Holiday&quot;.

=== Music metamorphosis ===

Another album &quot;Elektrenika&quot; (&quot;Electrenic&quot; – mix of words &quot;electronic&quot; and &quot;Reni&quot;) was released after a two-year break and was the breakthrough turn in Jusis&#x27; sound for electronic music based on club rhythms, 2-step and house, inspired by the music from the 80&#x27;s. Almost all lyrics were written by Reni, just like half of the compositions. Another half was composed by her with Michal Przytula, who also produced the whole album with her. Przytula earlier worked with Reni on her previous albums as a record engineer. &quot;Elektrenika&quot; was promoted by &quot;Electrenic Night Tour&quot; which helped her to gain popularity among the fans of club music. The album brought two big hits, &quot;Nic o mnie nie wiecie&quot; (&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Anything About Me&quot;) and &quot;Nigdy Ciebie nie zapomnę&quot; (&quot;I Never Forget You&quot;) known on the record as &quot;Jakby przez sen&quot; (&quot;Like Through A Dream&quot;).

Jusis&#x27; fourth album &quot;Trans Misja&quot; (&quot;Trance Mission&quot; – a play on the words &quot;trance&quot;, &quot;mission&quot; and &quot;transmission&quot;), released after another two-year break in 2003, continued the music direction from the previous album, but offered different styles – including songs in the electro-pop style. This time Jusis produced and composed the whole album and wrote almost all lyrics. Michal Przytula remained record engineer and even became Reni&#x27;s manager. &quot;Trans Misja&quot; achieved more success than previous albums thanks to three huge hits &quot;Kiedyś Cię znajdę&quot; (&quot;Someday I Find You&quot;), &quot;Ostatni raz (nim zniknę)&quot; (&quot;The Last Time Before I Disappear&quot;), &quot;It&#x27;s Not Enough&quot; and still more popular club tournee &quot;Top Secret Tour&quot;. The completion of this success was another Fryderyk Award, this time for Best Dance/Electronic/Club Album of the Year.

=== Club icon ===

For Reni Jusis&#x27; fifth album &quot;Magnes&quot; (&quot;Magnet&quot;), her fans had to wait three years, until 2006. In the meantime, Reni left her record label and established her own, named Pink Pong Records, connected with Polish division of Universal Music. In the beginning of 2006, EMI released the 5-disc box set &quot;Dyskografia&quot; (&quot;Discography&quot;) containing Reni Jusis&#x27; first four albums and a DVD featuring all her solo music videos.

The album &quot;Magnes&quot; was produced and almost entirely composed by Jusis and Przytuła (as Mic Microphone). Reni also penned almost all the lyrics. The lead single, &quot;Kilka prostych prawd&quot; (&quot;A Few Simple Truths&quot;), was released in late 2005, nine months before the album. The electro-pop song outwardly signaled that the sound of the new material would be the same as on the previous record. Still, &quot;Magnes&quot; turned out to be a radical dance album; additionally, all songs were merged into each other, like one continuous club set. This album consolidated Reni Jusis&#x27; position as an icon of Polish club music. The release of the album was accompanied by the second single, the eponymous title track &quot;Magnes&quot; (&quot;Magnet&quot;). Apart from seven new tracks, the album also featured new English language versions of three older hit songs (&quot;Leniviec&quot;, &quot;Nigdy Ciebie nie zapomnę&quot; (as &quot;How Can I Ever Forget You&quot;) and &quot;Kto pokocha&quot; (as &quot;Single Bite Lover&quot;) and remixes of album&#x27;s first two singles. The next singles released from the album were &quot;Mixtura&quot; (&quot;Mixture&quot;) and &quot;Niemy krzyk&quot; (&quot;Mute Shout&quot;).

&quot;Magnes&quot; also won another Fryderyk Award in 2007 for Best Club Album of the Year. The album was supported by a major club tour, the &quot;Magnes Live Tour&quot;. The tour was promoted by a brand new single, &quot;Motyle&quot; (&quot;Butterflies&quot;).

=== Acoustic turn ===
After a nearly two-year break, Reni Jusis announced the release of an album of acoustic music. The album got released in 2009 under the title &quot;Iluzjon cz. I&quot; (&quot;Iluzjon, Part I&quot;) and was promoted by the single &quot;A mogło być tak pięknie&quot; (&quot;It Could Have Been So Lovely&quot;). It was released by Jusis&#x27; own new record label, Amfibia Records. The new project wasn&#x27;t only a stylistic turning point in her career but also a turn in the way of performing. This time the artist planned to perform in old theatres instead of clubs, because of the album&#x27;s title, which is the name of the old cinema Jusis used to go to when she was young. Unfortunately sales of this album were so poor that Jusis didn&#x27;t go on tour. Jusis explained that the sudden turn in her style is caused by the aim of going back to her first musical fascinations. &#x27;The concert of Soyka &amp; Yanina impressed me of all concerts the most,&#x27; she spoke. &#x27;It was after this particular concert that I started to think of my own music career and founding a band consisting of eminent musicians. Not until today, after ten-year-long career, I had been ready to take up this challenge&#x27;, she confessed.

While working on this album she married the vocalist and composer Tomek Makowiecki, on August 8, 2008. On January 1, 2010, Jusis gave birth to their son, Teofil.

In July 2010 Jusis recorded the song &quot;Twoją wiarę mam&quot; (&quot;I Have Your Faith&quot;) for the Polish version of the soundtrack to Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue&quot;. In February 2011 she dubbed a Polish version of the computer game &quot;Test Drive Unlimited 2&quot;.

In November 2011 Jusis released her first book, written with Magda Targosz, &quot;Poradnik dla zielonych rodziców&quot; (&quot;A Guide For Green Parents&quot;), promoting the raising of children in accordance with ecology.

=== Return to dance music ===
In 2016, almost seven years after her last album, Jusis released her new one with dance music, called &quot;Bang!&quot;. It was released by the Polish division of Sony Music. Her new avant-garde electronic sound was almost entirely created by producer Stendek. Jusis penned all the lyrics. The album was promoted by singles &quot;Bejbi Siter&quot; (&quot;Babysitter&quot;), &quot;Zombi świat&quot; (&quot;Zombie World&quot;) and &quot;Delta&quot;, followed by club tournee &quot;Bang! Tour&quot;.

<text>The Shetucket River is a tributary of the Thames River, long, in eastern Connecticut in the United States.

It is formed at Willimantic by the junction of the Willimantic and Natchaug rivers. It flows southeast and south. Approximately northeast of Norwich it receives the Quinebaug River and broadens into a wide estuary which stretches southeast for approximately and joins the Thames estuary on the south side of Norwich.

The river flows through a rural section of New England, despite the historical presence of industry in the surrounding region. Parts of the rivers have been designated by the federal government as the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor. The National Park Service describes the river valley as the &quot;last green valley&quot; in the Boston-to-Washington megalopolis. In nighttime satellite photos, the valley appears distinctively dark amidst the lights of the surrounding urban and suburban regions.

==Crossings==
== Environmental issues ==
The Shetucket River has been tested for the presence of PFAS following the June 8, 2019 incident that spilled thousands of gallons of firefighting foam in the Farmington River. Elevated levels of PFAS were found in bass collected in the Shetucket River, Natchaug River and the Willimantic River. As of 2023, the Connecticut Department of Energy &amp; Environmental Protection still mentions a fish consumption advisory in effect for those three rivers.

==Paddling the River==
The entire length of the river, as well as the lower part of the Natchaug River flowing into it, is a popular recreational paddling route. The water trail is designated as a National Recreation Trail.

Canoe/Kayak launch sites are located at the following locations:
*Lauter Park off Route 195 - Willimantic (on Natchaug River 1 mile above Shetucket River)
*Recreation Park on Plains Road - Windham
*Baltic Riverside Park on Route 97 - Sprague
*Occum Dam canoe portage - Sprague
*Lisbon Canoe Launch off Route 169 - Lisbon
*Greenville Dam canoe portage - Norwich
*Howard Brown Park - Norwich

Short, marked portages are required at four hydroelectric dams: Scotland Dam, Occum Dam, Taftville Dam, and Greenville Dam.

<doc id="642879" wikidata="Q1975513" url="?curid=642879" title="Shuffleboard">
<text>Shuffleboard is a game in which players use cues to push weighted discs, sending them gliding down a narrow court, with the purpose of having them come to rest within a marked scoring area. As a more generic term, it refers to the family of shuffleboard-variant games as a whole.

== History ==
The earliest references to shuffleboard (as table shuffleboard) appear in Tudor England. Henry VIII played &quot;shovillabourde&quot; for stakes, and custom &quot;shovelboard&quot; tables were kept in wealthy English households until the 17th century. Examples of such tables survive at Stanway House and Tredegar House. The rising popularity of billiards in that century displaced shovelboard from high society, but variations of it continued in public houses. One of these called shove-groat was played during Henry&#x27;s reign and was widespread enough to be banned by name in the Unlawful Games Act 1541. A similar game called shove ha&#x27;penny is still played today.
Travel literature and other sources describe ship passengers improvising shuffleboard games on deck (also called deck billiards or deck skittles) as early as the 1830s to pass time at sea. One account describes shuffleboard as &quot;a kind of deck bagatelle,&quot; a then-popular billiards game with numbered scoring targets. Robert Ball is credited with bringing this &quot;deck shuffleboard&quot; ashore in 1913 when he added a court in front of his Lyndhurst Hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida. The game spread through Daytona Beach and around the state, prompting the establishment of clubs and regulations. The St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club began in 1924 with two courts and, driven by the game&#x27;s surging popularity, expanded to 116 courts by 1939.

Efforts to develop the game as a professional sport had limited success, and by the 1960s club participation had dropped significantly. The St. Petersburg Club was down to 35 members in the early 2000s before it rebounded with an influx of younger players. The game continues throughout the United States as an amateur pastime, attractive to older players due to its combination of low physical demands and strategic complexity. The Florida version of the game is also played on cruise ships and has been adapted back into table form.

== Gameplay ==

Players use a &quot;cue&quot; (&quot;cue-stick&quot;), to push their colored &quot;discs&quot;, down a &quot;court&quot; (a flat floor of concrete, wood or other hard material, marked with lines denoting scoring zones), attempting to place their discs within a marked scoring area at the far end of the court. The discs themselves are of two contrasting colors (usually yellow and black), each color belonging to a player or team. The scoring diagram is divided by lines, into six scoring zones, with the following values: 10, 8, 8, 7, 7, 10-off (minus ten).

After eight discs (four per team, taking alternating shots) have been played from one end of the court (a &quot;frame&quot;), the final score values of discs for each player (or team) in the scoring zones is assessed: If a disc is completely within a scoring zone without touching (overlapping) any part of the border-line of the zone, it is &quot;good&quot; and that zone value is added to the correct player&#x27;s score for the frame, and then to the player&#x27;s total points. Both players&#x27; good discs are added to their respective scores. Players (or teams of two players, one at each end) take turns going first during a game, so that the advantageous last shot of a frame (the &quot;hammer&quot;) also alternates between players.

The winner of the game may be the first to reach any total decided upon, or may be the higher score after playing a certain number of frames (e.g. 8, 12 or 16). There is also the &#x27;first to 75-points&#x27; game. Ties are broken by playing extra frames (two for singles, four for doubles).

=== Court description ===
Dimensions of a floor shuffleboard court can vary to suit available space, but an official shuffleboard court is wide by in length plus a shooting area at each end. Typically a scoring zone is painted at each end of the court to reduce set-up time between games. Each scoring zone comprises an isosceles triangle 6 feet × 9 feet with the short edge away from the shooter. Behind the scoring zone is the &quot;10-off&quot; zone, an area 1½ feet deep. The court surface is usually a uniform dark green; lines are 1 inch wide except for the mid-shooting area. white lines form the scoring triangle and further divide the triangle into the separate scoring zones. (Line width is not considered in court dimensions given here.)
The court is the same from each end, including:

* A Player Shooting Area. The shooting area begins behind the back line of the 10-off trapezoid. This line is called the Baseline. The shooter may not step on or beyond the Baseline.
* A &quot;10-off&quot; area or &quot;kitchen&quot; measuring . The sides of the 10-off area are defined by two lines running at the same angle as the Scoring Triangle.
* The &quot;Back-7 Line&quot; crosses the entire court.
* A &quot;center-line&quot; runs from the middle of the Back-7-line up the middle of the court for . The two &quot;7&quot; score zones are located on each side of the Center-Line, for a length of 3 feet, bounded at the top by the &quot;Back-8&quot; line, running side to side across and within the scoring triangle;
* The two &quot;8&quot; scoring zones are located one each side of the center-line for a length of , bounded at the top by the &quot;Top-8&quot; line running side to side across and within the scoring triangle, and forming a &quot;T&quot; with the end of the center-line.
* The &quot;10&quot; scoring zone is at the peak of the overall scoring triangle, and is 3 feet in height, from the Top-8 line to the peak of the triangle. A further &quot;dead-line&quot; or &quot;lag-line&quot; runs from side to side 12 feet from the base-line. The dead-line is therefore 3 feet from the tip of the triangle.
* There are two dead-lines, 12 feet apart. Any shot disc that does not cross or touch the furthest dead-line is then simply removed from the court (a wasted shot).

=== Equipment ===

Modern floor shuffleboard is played with eight round, hard, durable diameter plastic discs. New discs are about in thickness, weighing . In a set of discs, there are four discs of a light color and four of a dark color. One color is used by one team. The most common colors are yellow and black, but others are occasionally used. The cue length is or less, with hard plastic feet on the end (as metal would damage the court surface). &quot;Disc&quot; and &quot;cue&quot; are the terms adopted in Florida-style regulations, although the alternate terms &quot;biscuit&quot; and &quot;tang&quot; are sometimes used.

There are two basic types of scoreboard:
* &quot;Resort type&quot; uses two sliders that can move up and down a numbered scale, like a thermometer, with values running from zero at the bottom to 75 at the top. Each team uses their own slider to record their total score. The resort-type scoreboard is simple and durable, but provides no way to detect scoring errors from one frame to the next.
* &quot;Blackboard&quot; (or whiteboard) type is ruled with four or eight horizontal lines and each team&#x27;s total score is written after each frame, yellow on the left and black on the right. When all the lines have been filled with scores the top lines are erased and scores are again written from the top. The advantage of the blackboard type is that mistakes in adding and recording the score are easier to spot, because previous scores should always be seen. As well, it is easy to keep track of frames played using small numbers written down the scoreboard. In the western United States and western Canada, blackboard-type scoreboards run from side-to-side, but the principle is the same.

Courts are available for use on residential decks or on any solid flat surface, in the form of roll-out plastic mats, or adjustable arrays of plastic tiles. With the tile courts, the dimensions can be adapted to the space available; e.g. it is possible to play on a court by . The roll-out mats are available in two sizes, and . The smaller mats are designed to fit on a domestic patio or driveway. The discs and cues are the same standard size, regardless which court size is used.

=== Strategy ===

Discs are scored according to their final position at the end of the frame, rather than where they were originally shot, and striking any previously shot disc is permitted. These rules bring a significant strategic aspect to the gameplay. An unobstructed disc in the scoring area can be knocked out of the court or into the 10-off area by an opposing player. It is common to block the scoring area by shooting discs into the zone between the dead line and scoring triangle. A blocking disc on the opponent&#x27;s side obstructs them from scoring with a straight shot, while a blocking disc on one&#x27;s own side secures that side for straight shots. The last shot of a frame, called the &quot;hammer,&quot; is a critical opportunity to change the score in one&#x27;s favor.

== International Shuffleboard Association ==
The ISA was founded March 10, 1979, in St. Petersburg, Florida. The ISA was designed to make shuffleboard more popular in countries outside the North American continent, and to foster shuffleboard through international competitions. In 1981 in Muskegon, Michigan the first ISA Team World Championships were held, starting with teams from Canada, the USA and Japan only. Australia (1991), Brazil (1997), Germany (2006), Norway (2011) Russia (2013) and lately Netherlands (2023) joined the World Championships, which take place yearly and last for one week.

== Table shuffleboard variants ==
In table shuffleboard, the play area is most commonly a wooden or laminated surface covered with silicone beads (colloquially called &#x27;shuffleboard wax&#x27;) to reduce friction. In the United States, a long, narrow 22 ft table is most commonly used, though tables as short as 9 ft are known.

Players try to slide metal-and-plastic pucks, sometimes called weights or shuckles, to come to rest within zones at the other end of the board. Cues are not used, the pucks being propelled with the hands directly on the raised table. There are scoring zones at each end of the table so that direction of play can rotate after each frame, or so that teams can play both directions during one frame. More points are awarded for weights scoring closer to the far edge of the board. Players take turns sliding the pucks, trying to score points, bump opposing pucks off the board, and/or protect their own pucks from bump-offs. The long sides of the table are bounded by gutters into which pucks can fall or be knocked (in which case they are no longer in play for the remainder of the frame). A variant known sometimes as bankboard has rubber cushions or &#x27;banks&#x27; running the length of both sides of the table, instead of gutters, and as in billiards, the banks can be used to gain favorable position. A common and even smaller-scale British tabletop variant is shove ha&#x27;penny, played with coins, while a somewhat larger wooden-puck variant called &quot;sjoelen&quot;, which has much in common with the ball games bagatelle and skeeball, is played principally in the Netherlands.

=== Object of the game ===
The objective of the game is to slide, by hand, all four of one&#x27;s Weights alternately against those of an opponent, so that they reach the highest scoring area without falling off the end of the board into the alley. Furthermore, a player&#x27;s Weight(s) must be farther down the board than his opponent&#x27;s Weight(s), in order to be in scoring position. This may be achieved either by knocking off the opponent&#x27;s Weight(s), or by outdistancing them. Horse collar, the most common form of the game, is played to either 15 or, more typically, 21. Only the weights in front score.

The standard size of outdoor court is 52 feet long and 10 feet wide. For playing on surface, players hold stick like paddles to propel the pucks (biscuits/discs) into a numerical area that shows lines with specific scoring points.

<doc id="642884" wikidata="Q5345443" url="?curid=642884" title="Edward Sterling">
<text>Edward Sterling (17731847) was a British journalist.

==Life==
He was the son of the Rev. Anthony Sterling, and was born at Waterford. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin. Called to the Irish Bar, he fought as a militia captain at the Battle of Vinegar Hill, and then volunteered with his company into the line. On the break-up of his regiment he went to Scotland and took to farming at Kames Castle.

In 1810, Sterling and his family moved to Llanblethian in the Vale of Glamorgan, and during his residence there Edward Sterling, under the signature of &quot;Vetus,&quot; contributed a number of letters to &quot;The Times&quot;. These were reprinted in 1812, and a second series in 1814. In that year he moved to Paris, but on the escape of Napoleon from Elba in 1815 took up residence in London, obtaining a position on the staff of &quot;The Times&quot;; and during the late years of Thomas Barnes&#x27;s administration he was practically editor. His fiery, emphatic and oracular mode of writing conferred those characteristics on &quot;The Times&quot; which were recognized in the nickname, the &quot;Thunderer.&quot;

==Family==
In 1804 Sterling married Hester Coningham. Her uncle Walter Coningham (died 1830) had made a fortune through the sugar plantations of St Vincent, and his money, based on slave labour, supported the Sterlings. The couple had seven children, of whom five died young, The remaining sons were:

*Colonel Sir Anthony Coningham Sterling (1805–1871). He served in the Crimean War and as military secretary to Lord Clyde during the Indian Mutiny; and was the author of &quot;The Highland Brigade in the Crimea&quot; and other books.
*John Sterling (1806–1844), man of letters.

<text>In the archaeology of the Stone Age, an industry or technocomplex is a typological classification of stone tools.

An industry consists of a number of lithic assemblages, typically including a range of different types of tools, that are grouped together on the basis of shared technological or morphological characteristics. For example, the Acheulean industry includes hand-axes, cleavers, scrapers and other tools with different forms, but which were all manufactured by the symmetrical reduction of a bifacial core producing large flakes. Industries are usually named after a type site where these characteristics were first observed (e.g. the Mousterian industry is named after the site of Le Moustier). By contrast, Neolithic axeheads from the Langdale axe industry were recognised as a type well before the centre at Great Langdale was identified by finds of debitage and other remains of the production, and confirmed by petrography (geological analysis). The stone was quarried and rough axe heads were produced there, to be more finely worked and polished elsewhere.

As a taxonomic classification of artefacts, industries rank higher than archaeological cultures. Cultures are usually defined from a range of different artefact types and are thought to be related to a distinct cultural tradition. By contrast, industries are defined by basic elements of lithic production which may have been used by many unrelated human groups over tens or even hundred thousands of years, and over very wide geographical ranges. Sites producing tools from the Acheulean industry stretch from France to China, as well as Africa. Consequently, shifts between lithic industries are thought to reflect major milestones in human evolution, such as changes in cognitive ability or even the replacement of one human species by another. However, findings from ancient DNA studies describe several changes and periods of stasis in European populations that are not strongly reflected in the current cultural taxonomic frameworks. Therefore, artefacts from a single industry may come from a number of different cultures.

<doc id="642886" wikidata="Q521166" url="?curid=642886" title="Quantum well">
<text>A quantum well is a potential well with only discrete energy values.

The classic model used to demonstrate a quantum well is to confine particles, which were initially free to move in three dimensions, to two dimensions, by forcing them to occupy a planar region. The effects of quantum confinement take place when the quantum well thickness becomes comparable to the de Broglie wavelength of the carriers (generally electrons and holes), leading to energy levels called &quot;energy subbands&quot;, i.e., the carriers can only have discrete energy values.

The concept of quantum well was proposed in 1963 independently by Herbert Kroemer and by Zhores Alferov and R.F. Kazarinov.

== History ==
The semiconductor quantum well was developed in 1970 by Esaki and Tsu, who also invented synthetic superlattices. They suggested that a heterostructure made up of alternating thin layers of semiconductors with different band-gaps should exhibit interesting and useful properties. Since then, much effort and research has gone into studying the physics of quantum well systems as well as developing quantum well devices.

The development of quantum well devices is greatly attributed to the advancements in crystal growth techniques. This is because quantum well devices require structures that are of high purity with few defects. Therefore, having great control over the growth of these heterostructures allows for the development of semiconductor devices that can have very fine-tuned properties.

Quantum wells and semiconductor physics has been a hot topic in physics research. Development of semiconductor devices using structures made up of multiple semiconductors resulted in Nobel Prizes for Zhores Alferov and Herbert Kroemer in 2000.

The theory surrounding quantum well devices has led to significant advancements in the production and efficiency of many modern components such as light-emitting diodes, transistors for example. Today, such devices are ubiquitous in modern cell phones, computers, and many other computing devices.

== Fabrication ==
Quantum wells are formed in semiconductors by having a material, like gallium arsenide, sandwiched between two layers of a material with a wider bandgap, like aluminum arsenide. (Other examples: a layer of indium gallium nitride sandwiched between two layers of gallium nitride.)
These structures can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapor deposition with control of the layer thickness down to monolayers.

Thin metal films can also support quantum well states, in particular, thin metallic overlayers grown in metal and semiconductor surfaces. The vacuum-metal interface confines the electron (or hole) on one side, and in general, by an absolute gap with semiconductor substrates, or by a projected band-gap with metal substrates.

There are 3 main approaches to growing a QW material system: lattice-matched, strain-balanced, and strained.
* Lattice-matched system: In a lattice-matched system, the well and the barrier have a similar lattice constant as the underlying substrate material. With this method, the bandgap difference there is minimal dislocation but also a minimal shift in the absorption spectrum.
* Strain-balanced system: In a strain-balanced system, the well and barrier are grown so that the increase in lattice constant of one of the layers is compensated by the decrease in lattice constant in the next compared to the substrate material. The choice of thickness and composition of the layers affect bandgap requirements and carrier transport limitations. This approach provides the most flexibility in design, offering a high number of periodic QWs with minimal strain relaxation.
* Strained system: A strained system is grown with wells and barriers that are not similar in lattice constant. A strained system compresses the whole structure. As a result, the structure is only able to accommodate a few quantum wells.

== Description and overview ==

One of the simplest quantum well systems can be constructed by inserting a thin layer of one type of semiconductor material between two layers of another with a different band-gap. Consider, as an example, two layers of AlGaAs with a large bandgap surrounding a thin layer of GaAs with a smaller band-gap. Let’s assume that the change in material occurs along the &quot;z&quot;-direction and therefore the potential well is along the &quot;z&quot;-direction (no confinement in the &quot;x–y&quot; plane.). Since the bandgap of the contained material is lower than the surrounding AlGaAs, a quantum well (Potential well) is created in the GaAs region. This change in band energy across the structure can be seen as the change in the potential that a carrier would feel, therefore low energy carriers can be trapped in these wells. 

Within the quantum well, there are discrete energy eigenstates that carriers can have. For example, an electron in the conduction band can have lower energy within the well than it could have in the AlGaAs region of this structure. Consequently, an electron in the conduction band with low energy can be trapped within the quantum well. Similarly, holes in the valence band can also be trapped in the top of potential wells created in the valence band. The states that confined carriers can be in are particle-in-a-box-like states.

== Physics ==
Quantum wells and quantum well devices are a subfield of solid-state physics that is still extensively studied and researched today. The theory used to describe such systems uses important results from the fields of quantum physics, statistical physics, and electrodynamics.

=== Infinite well model ===
The simplest model of a quantum well system is the infinite well model. The walls/barriers of the potential well are assumed to be infinite in this model. In reality, the quantum wells are generally of the order of a few hundred millielectronvolts. However, as a first approximation, the infinite well model serves as a simple and useful model that provides some insight into the physics behind quantum wells.

Consider an infinite quantum well oriented in the &quot;z&quot;-direction, such that carriers in the well are confined in the &quot;z&quot;-direction but free to move in the &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot; plane. we choose the quantum well to run from formula_1 to formula_2. We assume that carriers experience no potential within the well and that the potential in the barrier region is infinitely high.

The Schrödinger equation for carriers in the infinite well model is:
: formula_3
where formula_4 is the reduced Planck constant and formula_5 is the effective mass of the carriers within the well region. The effective mass of a carrier is the mass that the electron &quot;feels&quot; in its quantum environment and generally differs between different semiconductors as the value of effective mass depends heavily on the curvature of the band. Note that formula_5 can be the effective mass of electrons in a well in the conduction band or for holes in a well in the valence band.

==== Solutions and energy levels ====

The solution wave functions cannot exist in the barrier region of the well, due to the infinitely high potential. Therefore, by imposing the following boundary conditions, the allowed wave functions are obtained,
: formula_7

The solution wave functions take the following form:
: formula_8

The subscript formula_9, (formula_10) denotes the integer quantum number and formula_11 is the wave vector associated with each state, given above. The associated discrete energies are given by:
: formula_12

The simple infinite well model provides a good starting point for analyzing the physics of quantum well systems and the effects of quantum confinement. The model correctly predicts that the energies in the well are inversely proportional to the square of the length of the well. This means that precise control over the width of the semiconductor layers, i.e. the length of the well, will allow for precise control of the energy levels allowed for carriers in the wells. This is an incredibly useful property for band-gap engineering. Furthermore, the model shows that the energy levels are proportional to the inverse of the effective mass. Consequently, heavy holes and light holes will have different energy states when trapped in the well. Heavy and light holes arise when the maxima of valence bands with different curvature coincide; resulting in two different effective masses.

A drawback of the infinite well model is that it predicts many more energy states than exist, as the walls of real quantum wells, are finite. The model also neglects the fact that in reality, the wave functions do not go to zero at the boundary of the well but &#x27;bleed&#x27; into the wall (due to quantum tunneling) and decay exponentially to zero. This property allows for the design and production of superlattices and other novel quantum well devices and is described better by the finite well model.

=== Finite well model ===
The finite well model provides a more realistic model of quantum wells. Here the walls of the well in the heterostructure are modeled using a finite potential formula_13, which is the difference in the conduction band energies of the different semiconductors. Since the walls are finite and the electrons can tunnel into the barrier region. Therefore the allowed wave functions will penetrate the barrier wall.

Consider a finite quantum well oriented in the &quot;z&quot;-direction, such that carriers in the well are confined in the &quot;z&quot;-direction but free to move in the &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot; plane. We choose the quantum well to run from formula_1 to formula_2. We assume that the carriers experience no potential within the well and potential of formula_13 in the barrier regions.

The Schrodinger equation for carriers within the well is unchanged compared to the infinite well model, except for the boundary conditions at the walls, which now demand that the wave functions and their slopes are continuous at the boundaries.

Within the barrier region, Schrodinger’s equation for carriers reads:
: formula_17
where formula_18 is the effective mass of the carrier in the barrier region, which will generally differ from its effective mass within the well.

==== Solutions and energy levels ====

Using the relevant boundary conditions and the condition that the wave function must be continuous at the edge of the well, we get solutions for the wave vector formula_19 that satisfy the following transcendental equations:
: formula_20
and
: formula_21
where formula_22 is the exponential decay constant in the barrier region, which is a measure of how fast the wave function decays to zero in the barrier region. The quantized energy eigenstates inside the well, which depend on the wave vector and the quantum number (formula_9) are given by:
: formula_24

The exponential decay constant formula_22 is given by:
: formula_26

It depends on the eigenstate of a bound carrier formula_27, the depth of the well formula_13, and the effective mass of the carrier within the barrier region, formula_18.

The solutions to the transcendental equations above can easily be found using numerical or graphical methods. There are generally only a few solutions. However, there will always be at least one solution, so one bound state in the well, regardless of how small the potential is. Similar to the infinite well, the wave functions in the well are sinusoidal-like but exponentially decay in the barrier of the well. This has the effect of reducing the bound energy states of the quantum well compared to the infinite well.

=== Superlattices ===

A superlattice is a periodic heterostructure made of alternating materials with different band-gaps. The thickness of these periodic layers is generally of the order of a few nanometers. The band structure that results from such a configuration is a periodic series of quantum wells. It is important that these barriers are thin enough such that carriers can tunnel through the barrier regions of the multiple wells. A defining property of superlattices is that the barriers between wells are thin enough for adjacent wells to couple. Periodic structures made of repeated quantum wells that have barriers that are too thick for adjacent wave functions to couple, are called multiple quantum well (MQW) structures.

Since carriers can tunnel through the barrier regions between the wells, the wave functions of neighboring wells couple together through the thin barrier, therefore, the electronic states in superlattices form delocalized minibands. Solutions for the allowed energy states in superlattices is similar to that for finite quantum wells with a change in the boundary conditions that arise due to the periodicity of the structures. Since the potential is periodic, the system can be mathematically described in a similar way to a one-dimensional crystal lattice.

== Applications ==
Because of their quasi-two-dimensional nature, electrons in quantum wells have a density of states as a function of energy that has distinct steps, versus a smooth square root dependence that is found in bulk materials. Additionally, the effective mass of holes in the valence band is changed to more closely match that of electrons in the valence band. These two factors, together with the reduced amount of active material in quantum wells, leads to better performance in optical devices such as laser diodes. As a result, quantum wells are used widely in diode lasers, including red lasers for DVDs and laser pointers, infra-red lasers in fiber optic transmitters, or in blue lasers. They are also used to make HEMTs (high electron mobility transistors), which are used in low-noise electronics. Quantum well infrared photodetectors are also based on quantum wells and are used for infrared imaging.

By doping either the well itself or preferably, the barrier of a quantum well with donor impurities, a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) may be formed. Such a structure creates the conducting channel of a HEMT and has interesting properties at low temperature. One such feature is the quantum Hall effect, seen at high magnetic fields. Acceptor dopants can also lead to a two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG).

=== Saturable absorber ===
A quantum well can be fabricated as a saturable absorber using its saturable absorption property. Saturable absorbers are widely used in passively mode locking lasers. Semiconductor saturable absorbers (SESAMs) were used for laser mode-locking as early as 1974 when p-type germanium was used to mode lock a CO2 laser which generated pulses ~500 ps. Modern SESAMs are III–V semiconductor single quantum well (SQW) or multiple quantum wells (MQW) grown on semiconductor distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). They were initially used in a resonant pulse modelocking (RPM) scheme as starting mechanisms for Ti:sapphire lasers which employed KLM as a fast saturable absorber. RPM is another coupled-cavity mode-locking technique. Different from APM lasers that employ non-resonant Kerr-type phase nonlinearity for pulse shortening, RPM employs the amplitude nonlinearity provided by the resonant band filling effects of semiconductors. SESAMs were soon developed into intracavity saturable absorber devices because of more inherent simplicity with this structure. Since then, the use of SESAMs has enabled the pulse durations, average powers, pulse energies and repetition rates of ultrafast solid-state lasers to be improved by several orders of magnitude. Average power of 60 W and repetition rate up to 160 GHz were obtained. By using SESAM-assisted KLM, sub-6 fs pulses directly from a Ti:sapphire oscillator was achieved. A major advantage SESAMs have over other saturable absorber techniques is that absorber parameters can be easily controlled over a wide range of values. For example, saturation fluence can be controlled by varying the reflectivity of the top reflector while modulation depth and recovery time can be tailored by changing the low-temperature growing conditions for the absorber layers. This freedom of design has further extended the application of SESAMs into mode-locking of fibre lasers where a relatively high modulation depth is needed to ensure self-starting and operation stability. Fibre lasers working at ~1 μm and 1.5 μm were successfully demonstrated.

=== Thermoelectrics ===
Quantum wells have shown promise for energy harvesting as thermoelectric devices. They are claimed to be easier to fabricate and offer the potential to operate at room temperature. The wells connect a central cavity to two electronic reservoirs. The central cavity is kept at a hotter temperature than the reservoirs. The wells act as filters that allow electrons of certain energies to pass through. In general, greater temperature differences between the cavity and the reservoirs increases electron flow and output power.

An experimental device delivered output power of about 0.18 W/cm2 for a temperature difference of 1 K, nearly double the power of a quantum dot energy harvester. The extra degrees of freedom allowed larger currents. Its efficiency is slightly lower than the quantum dot energy harvesters. Quantum wells transmit electrons of any energy above a certain level, while quantum dots pass only electrons of a specific energy.

One possible application is to convert waste heat from electric circuits, e.g., in computer chips, back into electricity, reducing the need for cooling and energy to power the chip.

=== Solar cells ===
Quantum wells have been proposed to increase the efficiency of solar cells. The theoretical maximum efficiency of traditional single-junction cells is about 34%, due in large part to their inability to capture many different wavelengths of light. Multi-junction solar cells, which consist of multiple p-n junctions of different bandgaps connected in series, increase the theoretical efficiency by broadening the range of absorbed wavelengths, but their complexity and manufacturing cost limit their use to niche applications. On the other hand, cells consisting of a p–i–n junction in which the intrinsic region contains one or more quantum wells, lead to an increased photocurrent over dark current, resulting in a net efficiency increase over conventional p–n cells. Photons of energy within the well depth are absorbed in the wells and generate electron–hole pairs. In room temperature conditions, these photo-generated carriers have sufficient thermal energy to escape the well faster than the recombination rate. Elaborate multi-junction quantum well solar cells can be fabricated using layer-by-layer deposition techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapor deposition. It has also been shown that metal or dielectric nanoparticles added above the cell lead to further increases in photo-absorption by scattering incident light into lateral propagation paths confined within the multiple-quantum-well intrinsic layer.

==== Single-junction solar cells ====
With conventional single-junction photovoltaic solar cells, the power it generates is the product of the photocurrent and voltage across the diode. As semiconductors only absorb photons with energies higher than their bandgap, smaller bandgap material absorbs more of the sun&#x27;s radiative spectrum resulting in a larger current. The highest open-circuit voltage achievable is the built-in bandgap of the material. Because the bandgap of the semiconductor determines both the Current and Voltage, designing a solar cell is always a trade-off between maximizing current output with a low bandgap and voltage output with a high bandgap. The maximum theoretical limit of efficiency for conventional solar cells is determined to be only 31%, with the best silicon devices achieving an optimal limit of 25%.

With the introduction of quantum wells (QWs), the efficiency limit of single-junction strained QW silicon devices have increased to 28.3%. The increase is due to the bandgap of the barrier material determining the built-in voltage. Whereas the bandgap of the QWs is now what determines the absorption limit. With their experiments on p–i–n junction photodiodes, Barnham&#x27;s group showed that placing QWs in the depleted region increases the efficiency of a device. Researchers infer that the resulting increase indicates that the generation of new carriers and photocurrent due to the inclusion of lower energies in the absorption spectrum outweighs the drop in terminal voltage resulting from the recombination of carriers trapped in the quantum wells. Further studies have been able to conclude that the photocurrent increase is directly related to the redshift of the absorption spectrum.

==== Multi-junction solar cells ====
Nowadays, among non-QW solar cells, the III/V multi-junction solar cells are the most efficient, recording a maximum efficiency of 46% under high sunlight concentrations. Multi-junction solar cells are created by stacking multiple p-i-n junctions of different bandgaps. The efficiency of the solar cell increases with the inclusion of more of the solar radiation in the absorption spectrum by introducing more QWs of different bandgaps. The direct relation between the bandgap and lattice constant hinders the advancement of multi-junction solar cells. As more quantum wells (QWs) are grown together, the material grows with dislocations due to the varying lattice constants. Dislocations reduce the diffusion length and carrier lifetime. Hence, QWs provide an alternate approach to multi-junction solar cells with minimal crystal dislocation.

===== Bandgap energy =====
Researchers are looking to use QWs to grow high-quality material with minimal crystal dislocations and increase the efficiency of light absorption and carrier collection to realize higher efficiency QW solar cells. Bandgap tunability helps researchers with designing their solar cells. We can estimate the effective bandgap as the function of the bandgap energy of the QW and the shift in bandgap energy due to the steric strain: the quantum confinement Stark effect (QCSE) and quantum size effect (QSE).
: formula_30

The strain of the material causes two effects to the bandgap energy. First is the change in relative energy of the conduction and valence band. This energy change is affected by the strain, formula_31, elastic stiffness coefficients, formula_32 and formula_33, and hydrostatic deformation potential, formula_34.
: formula_35

Second, due to the strain, there is a splitting of heavy-hole and light-hole degeneracy. In a heavily compressed material, the heavy holes (hh) move to a higher energy state. In tensile material, light holes (lh) move to a higher energy state. One can calculate the difference in energy due to the splitting of hh and lh from the shear deformation potential, formula_36, strain, formula_31, and elastic stiffness coefficients, formula_32 and formula_33.
: formula_40
: formula_41

The quantum confinement Stark effect induces a well-thickness dependent shift in the bandgap. If formula_42 is the elemental charge; formula_43 and formula_44 are the effective width of QWs in the conduction and valence band, respectively; formula_45 is the induced electric field due to piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization; and formula_4 is the reduced Planck constant, then the energy shift is:
: formula_47

The quantum size effect (QSE) is the discretization of energy a charge carrier undergoes due to confinement when its Bohr radius is larger than the size of the well. As the quantum well thickness increases, QSEs decrease. The decrease in QSEs causes the formula_48 state to move down and decrease the effective bandgap. The Kronig–Penney model is used to calculate the quantum states, and Anderson&#x27;s rule is applied to estimate the conduction band and valence band offsets in energy. 
===== Carrier capture and lifetime =====
With the effective use of carriers in the QWs, researchers can increase the efficiency of quantum well solar cells (QWSCs). Within QWs in the intrinsic region of the p-i-n solar cells, optically generated carriers are either collected by the built-in field or lost due to carrier recombination. Carrier recombination is the process in which a hole and electron recombine to cancel their charges. Carriers can be collected through drift by the electric field. One can either use thin wells and transport carriers via thermionic emission or use thin barriers and transport carriers via tunneling.

Carrier lifetime for escape is determined by tunneling and thermionic emission lifetimes. Tunneling and thermionic emission lifetimes both depend on having a low effective barrier height. They are expressed through the following equations:
: formula_49
: formula_50,
where formula_51 and formula_52 are effective masses of charge carriers in the barrier and well, formula_53 is the effective barrier height, and formula_54 is the electric field.

Then one can calculate the escape lifetime by the following:
: formula_55

The total probability of minority carriers escaping from QWs is a sum of the probability of each well,
: formula_56.

Here, formula_57, where formula_58 is recombination lifetime, and formula_59 is the total number of QWs in the intrinsic region.

For formula_60, there is a high probability for carrier recollection. Assumptions made in this method of modeling are that each carrier crosses formula_59 QWs, whereas, in reality, they cross different numbers of QWs and that a carrier capture is at 100%, which may not be true in high background doping conditions.

For example, taking In0.18Ga0.82As (125formula_62)/GaAs0.36P0.64 (40formula_62) into consideration, tunneling, and thermionic emission lifetimes are 0.89 and 1.84, respectively. Even if a recombination time of 50ns is assumed, the escape probability of a single quantum well and a 100 quantum wells is 0.984 and 0.1686, which is not sufficient for efficient carrier capture. Reducing the barrier thickness to 20 ångstroms reduces formula_64 to 4.1276 ps, increasing the escape probability over a 100 QWs to 0.9918. Indicating that using thin-barriers is essential for more efficient carrier collection.

==== Sustainability of quantum well devices compared to bulk material in light of performance ====
In the 1.1–1.3 eV range, Sayed et al. compares the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a metamorphic InGaAs bulk subcell on Ge substrates by Spectrolab to a 100-period In0.30Ga0.70As(3.5 nm)/GaAs(2.7 nm)/ GaAs0.60P0.40(3.0 nm) QWSC by Fuji et al. The bulk material shows higher EQE values than those of QWs in the 880-900 nm region, whereas the QWs have higher EQE values in the 400-600 nm range. This result provides some evidence that there is a struggle of extending the QWs&#x27; absorption thresholds to longer wavelengths due to strain balance and carrier transport issues. However, the bulk material has more deformations leading to low minority carrier lifetimes.

In the 1.6–1.8 eV range, the lattice-matched AlGaAs by Heckelman et al. and InGaAsP by Jain et al. are compared by Sayed with the lattice-matched InGaAsP/InGaP QW structure by Sayed et al. Like the 1.1–1.3 eV range, the EQE of the bulk material is higher in the longer wavelength region of the spectrum, but QWs are advantageous in the sense that they absorb a broader region in the spectrum. Furthermore, they can be grown in lower temperatures preventing thermal degradation.

The application of quantum wells in many devices is a viable solution to increasing the energy efficiency of such devices. With lasers, the improvement has already lead to significant results like the LED. With QWSCs harvesting energy from the sun become a more potent method of cultivating energy by being able to absorb more of the sun&#x27;s radiation and by being able to capture such energy from the charge carriers more efficiently. A viable option such as QWSCs provides the public with an opportunity to move away from greenhouse gas inducing methods to a greener alternative, solar energy.

<text>Metairie Cemetery is a historic cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, founded in 1872. The name has caused some people to mistakenly presume it is located in Metairie, Louisiana, but it is located within the New Orleans city limits on Metairie Road (and formerly on the banks of the since filled-in Bayou Metairie).

==History==
===Metairie Course===
====1838====

Before becoming a cemetery, the site, established on a high-and-dry ridge along Bayou Metairie (now Metairie Road), was a horse racing track, founded in 1838 by Col. James Garrison and Richard Adams who acquired the land from the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company. Its first president was Alexander Barrow and board of governors included: George B. Mulligan, Thomas W. Chinn, Balie Peyton, Samuel Jarvis Peters, Thomas J. Wells, George B. Ogden (President of New Orleans Canal and Banking Company), and Miner Kenner. 

====1839====

The Spring Meeting of The Metairie Jockey Club for 1839 over the Metairie Course commenced on Tuesday, March 26, and lasted for six days. The First Day of racing Sweepstakes for 3-year olds, 2 Mile Heats, Entrance Fee $1,000, Forfeit Fee $250, Nine Subscribers: Montfort Wells&#x27; &quot;Beeswing&quot;, C.C.S. Farrar, D. Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Dublin&quot;, H.A. Tayloe, Minor Kenner&#x27;s &quot;Greydoc&quot;, Ira Smith&#x27;s &quot;Maria&quot;, James S. Garrison&#x27;s &quot;Altorf&quot;, William R. Barrow&#x27;s &quot;Picayune&quot;, James Shy&#x27;s &quot;Curculia&quot;. Same Day, A match between the noted trotting horses &quot;Bird&quot; and &quot;Confidence&quot;, 2-mile heats in harnesses for $6,000. Second Day, Wednesday, March 27, Jockey Club Purse $800, 2 Mile Heats. Same Day Sweepstakes for Gentlemen Riders, 2 Mile Heats, Entrance Fee $50, the proprietors to add a silver cup, value $300. Third Day, Jockey Club Purse $1,200, 3 Mile Heats. Fourth Day, Jockey Club Purse $2,000, 4 Mile Heats. Fifth Day, Jockey Club Purse $600, Mile Heats, best 3 in 5. Same Day, Sweepstakes for 2 Year Olds, Mile Heats, Entrance Fee $500, Forfeit Fee $150, seven subscribers:Montfort Wells, A.L. Bingaman, C.C.S. Farrar, W.J. Minor, Minor Kenner, W.R. Barrow, James Shy. Sixth Day, Proprietors Purse, $1,000, 3 Mile Heats. Same Day, Match between the celebrated trotting hosrse &quot;Pompeii&quot; and &quot;Rolla&quot;, best 3 in 5, in harness for $1,000. P. CENAS Secretary.

====1848====
In 1848 Richard Ten Broeck, later part of the syndicate that purchased Lexington, bought the course and likewise established a joint-stock company, officially founding The Metairie Jockey Club. 

The race track was the site of the famous Lexington-Lecomte Race, April 1, 1854, billed as the &quot;Great States&quot; race. Former President Millard Fillmore attended. While racing was suspended because of the American Civil War, it was used as a Confederate Camp (Camp Moore) until David Farragut took New Orleans for the Union in April 1862. Metairie Cemetery was built upon the grounds of the old Metairie Race Course after it went bankrupt.

===Conversion to a cemetery===
The race track, which was owned by the Metairie Jockey Club, refused membership to Charles T. Howard, a local resident who had gained his wealth by starting the first Louisiana State Lottery. After being refused membership, Howard vowed that the race course would become a cemetery. After the Civil War and Reconstruction, the track went bankrupt and Howard was able to see his curse come true. Today, Howard is buried in his tomb located on Central Avenue in the cemetery, which was built following the original oval layout of the track itself. Mr. Howard died in 1885 in Dobbs Ferry, New York, when he fell from a newly purchased horse.

Metairie Cemetery was previously owned and operated by Stewart Enterprises, Inc., of Jefferson, Louisiana. However, in December 2013, Service Corporation International bought Metairie Cemetery and other Stewart locations.

== Sights ==
Metairie Cemetery has the largest collection of elaborate marble tombs and funeral statuary in the city.

One of the most famous is the Army of Tennessee, Louisiana Division monument, a monumental tomb of Confederate soldiers of the American Civil War. The monument includes two notable works by sculptor Alexander Doyle (1857–1922):
* Atop the tomb is an 1877 equestrian statue of General Albert Sidney Johnston on his horse &quot;Fire-eater&quot;, holding binoculars in his right hand. General Johnston was for a time entombed here, but the remains were later removed to Texas.
* To the right of the entrance to the tomb is an 1885 life-size statue represents a Confederate officer about to read the roll of the dead during the American Civil War. The statue is said to be modeled after Sergeant William Brunet of the Louisiana Guard Battery, but is intended to represent all Confederate soldiers.

Other notable monuments in Metairie Cemetery include:
* the pseudo-Egyptian pyramid;
* Laure Beauregard Larendon&#x27;s tomb, which features Moorish details and beautiful stained glass;
* the former tomb of Storyville madam Josie Arlington;
* the Moriarty tomb with a marble monument with a height of tall, which required the construction of a temporary special spur railroad line to transport the monument&#x27;s building materials to the cemetery; and
* the memorial of 19th-century police chief David Hennessy, whose murder sparked a riot.

The initial construction of at least one of these elaborate final resting places – restaurateur Ruth Fertel&#x27;s mausoleum – is estimated to have cost between $125,000 to $500,000 (in late 20th century dollars).

<text>Thermoacoustics is the interaction between temperature, density and pressure variations of acoustic waves. Thermoacoustic heat engines can readily be driven using solar energy or waste heat and they can be controlled using proportional control. They can use heat available at low temperatures which makes it ideal for heat recovery and low power applications. The components included in thermoacoustic engines are usually very simple compared to conventional engines. The device can easily be controlled and maintained.

Thermoacoustic effects can be observed when partly molten glass tubes are connected to glass vessels. Sometimes spontaneously a loud and monotone sound is produced. A similar effect is observed if one side of a stainless steel tube is at room temperature (293 K) and the other side is in contact with liquid helium at 4.2 K. In this case, spontaneous oscillations are observed which are named &quot;Taconis oscillations&quot;. The mathematical foundation of thermoacoustics is by Nikolaus Rott. Later, the field was inspired by the work of John Wheatley and Swift and his co-workers. Technologically thermoacoustic devices have the advantage that they have no moving parts, which makes them attractive for applications where reliability is of key importance.

==Historical review of thermoacoustics==
Thermoacoustic-induced oscillations have been observed for centuries. Glass blowers produced heat-generated sound when blowing a hot bulb at the end of a cold narrow tube. This phenomenon also has been observed in cryogenic storage vessels, where oscillations are induced by the insertion of a hollow tube open at the bottom end in liquid helium, called Taconis oscillations, but the lack of heat removal system causes the temperature gradient to diminish and acoustic wave to weaken and then to stop completely. Byron Higgins made the first scientific observation of heat energy conversion into acoustical oscillations. He investigated the &quot;singing flame&quot; phenomena in a portion of a hydrogen flame in a tube with both ends open.

Physicist Pieter Rijke introduced this phenomenon into a greater scale by using a heated wire screen to induce strong oscillations in his Rijke tube. Feldman mentioned in his related review that a convective air current through the pipe is the main inducer of this phenomenon. The oscillations are strongest when the screen is at one fourth of the tube length. Research performed by Sondhauss in 1850 is known to be the first to approximate the modern concept of thermoacoustic oscillation. Sondhauss experimentally investigated the oscillations related to glass blowers. Sondhauss observed that sound frequency and intensity depends on the length and volume of the bulb. Lord Rayleigh gave a qualitative explanation of the Sondhauss thermoacoustic oscillations phenomena, where he stated that producing any type of thermoacoustic oscillations needs to meet a criterion: &quot;If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation or taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged&quot;. This shows that he related thermoacoustics to the interplay of density variations and heat injection. The formal theoretical study of thermoacoustics started by Kramers in 1949 when he generalized the Kirchhoff theory of the attenuation of sound waves at constant temperature to the case of attenuation in the presence of a temperature gradient. Rott made a breakthrough in the study and modeling of thermodynamic phenomena by developing a successful linear theory. After that, the acoustical part of thermoacoustics was linked in a broad thermodynamic framework by Swift.

==Sound==
Usually sound is understood in terms of pressure variations accompanied by an oscillating motion of a medium (gas, liquid or solid). Thermoacoustic machines rely more on the temperature-position variations than the usual pressure-velocity variations.

The sound intensity of ordinary speech is 65 dB. The pressure variations are about 0.05 Pa, the displacements 0.2 μm, and the temperature variations about 40 μK. So, the thermal effects of sound cannot be observed in daily life. However, at sound levels of 180 dB, which are normal in thermoacoustic systems, the pressure variations are 30 kPa, the displacements more than 10 cm, and the temperature variations 24 K.

A full theory of thermoacoustics should account for the propagation of heat in the fluid as it makes compression cycles during the propagation of the sound wave. Good insights can however be gained by making the usual assumption of adiabatic compression. Even if no heat is exchanged during adiabatic compression, the temperature of the fluid &quot;does&quot; change and will tell the correct direction of heat flow. Under the adiabatic approximation, the one-dimensional wave equation for sound reads
:formula_1
with &quot;t&quot; time, &quot;v&quot; the gas velocity, &quot;x&quot; the position, and &quot;c&quot; the sound velocity given by &quot;c2=γp0/ρ0&quot;. For an ideal gas, &quot;c2=γRT0/M&quot; with &quot;M&quot; the molar mass. In these expressions, &quot;p0&quot;, &quot;T0&quot;, and &quot;ρ0&quot; are the average pressure, temperature, and density respectively. In monochromatic plane waves, with angular frequency &quot;ω&quot; and with &quot;ω=kc&quot;, the solution is
:formula_2
The pressure variations are given by
:formula_3
The deviation &quot;δx&quot; of a gas-particle with equilibrium position &quot;x&quot; is given by
and the temperature variations are
The last two equations form a parametric representation of a tilted ellipse in the &quot;δT – δx&quot; plane with &quot;t&quot; as the parameter.

If formula_4, we are dealing with a pure standing wave. Figure 1a gives the dependence of the velocity and position amplitudes (red curve) and the pressure and temperature amplitudes (blue curve) for this case. The ellipse of the &quot;δT – δx&quot; plane is reduced to a straight line as shown in Fig. 1b. At the tube ends &quot;δx&quot; =0, so the &quot;δT – δx&quot; plot is a vertical line here. In the middle of the tube the pressure and temperature variations are zero, so we have a horizontal line. It can be shown that the power, transported by sound, is given by
:formula_5
where &quot;γ&quot; is the ratio of the gas specific heat at fixed pressure to the specific heat at fixed volume and &quot;A&quot; is the area of the cross section of the sound duct.
Since in a standing wave, formula_4, the average energy transport is zero.

If formula_7 or formula_8, we have a pure traveling wave. In this case, Eqs.(1) and (2) represent circles in the &quot;δT – δx&quot; diagram as shown in Fig. 1c, which applies to a pure traveling wave to the right. The gas moves to the right with a high temperature and back with a low temperature, so there is a net transport of energy.

==Penetration depths==
The thermoacoustic effect inside the stack takes place mainly in the region that is close to the solid walls of the stack. The layers of gas too far away from the stack walls experience adiabatic oscillations in temperature that result in no heat transfer to or from the walls, which is undesirable. Therefore, an important characteristic for any thermoacoustic element is the value of the thermal and viscous penetration depths. The thermal penetration depth &quot;δ&quot;κ is the thickness of the layer of the gas where heat can diffuse through during half a cycle of oscillations. Viscous penetration depth δv is the thickness of the layer where viscosity effect is effective near the boundaries. In case of sound, the characteristic length for thermal interaction is given by the thermal penetration depth &quot;δ&quot;κ
:formula_9
Here &quot;κ&quot; is the thermal conductivity, &quot;V&quot;m the molar volume, and &quot;C&quot;p the molar heat capacity at constant pressure. Viscous effects are determined by the viscous penetration depth &quot;δ&quot;ν
:formula_10
with &quot;η&quot; the gas viscosity and &quot;ρ&quot; its density. The Prandtl number of the gas is defined as
:formula_11
The two penetration depths are related as follows
:formula_12
For many working fluids, like air and helium, &quot;P&quot;r is of order 1, so the two penetration depths are about equal. For helium at normal temperature and pressure, Pr≈0.66.
For typical sound frequencies the thermal penetration depth is ca. 0.1 mm. That means that the thermal interaction between the gas and a solid surface is limited to a very thin layer near the surface. The effect of thermoacoustic devices is increased by putting a large number of plates (with a plate distance of a few times the thermal penetration depth) in the sound field forming a stack. Stacks play a central role in so-called standing-wave thermoacoustic devices.

==Thermoacoustic systems==
Acoustic oscillations in a medium are a set of time depending properties, which may transfer energy along its path. Along the path of an acoustic wave, pressure and density are not the only time dependent property, but also entropy and temperature. Temperature changes along the wave can be invested to play the intended role in the thermoacoustic effect. The interplay of heat and sound is applicable in both conversion ways. The effect can be used to produce acoustic oscillations by supplying heat to the hot side of a stack, and sound oscillations can be used to induce a refrigeration effect by supplying a pressure wave inside a resonator where a stack is located. In a thermoacoustic prime mover, a high temperature gradient along a tube where a gas media is contained induces density variations. Such variations in a constant volume of matter force changes in pressure. The cycle of thermoacoustic oscillation is a combination of heat transfer and pressure changes in a sinusoidal pattern. Self-induced oscillations can be encouraged, according to Lord Rayleigh, by the appropriate phasing of heat transfer and pressure changes.

===Standing-wave systems===
The thermoacoustic engine (TAE) is a device that converts heat energy into work in the form of acoustic energy. A thermoacoustic engine operates using the effects that arise from the resonance of a standing-wave in a gas. A standing-wave thermoacoustic engine typically has a thermoacoustic element called the &quot;stack&quot;. A stack is a solid component with pores that allow the operating gas fluid to oscillate while in contact with the solid walls. The oscillation of the gas is accompanied with the change of its temperature. Due to the introduction of solid walls into the oscillating gas, the plate modifies the original, unperturbed temperature oscillations in both magnitude and phase for the gas about a thermal penetration depth δ=√(2k/ω) away from the plate, where k is the thermal diffusivity of the gas and ω=2πf is the angular frequency of the wave. Thermal penetration depth is defined as the distance that heat can diffuse though the gas during a time 1/ω. In air oscillating at 1000 Hz, the thermal penetration depth is about 0.1 mm. Standing-wave TAE must be supplied with the necessary heat to maintain the temperature gradient on the stack. This is done by two heat exchangers on both sides of the stack.

If we put a thin horizontal plate in the sound field, the thermal interaction between the oscillating gas and the plate leads to thermoacoustic effects. If the thermal conductivity of the plate material would be zero, the temperature in the plate would exactly match the temperature profiles as in Fig. 1b. Consider the blue line in Fig. 1b as the temperature profile of a plate at that position. The temperature gradient in the plate would be equal to the so-called critical temperature gradient. If we would fix the temperature at the left side of the plate at ambient temperature &quot;T&quot;a (e.g. using a heat exchanger), then the temperature at the right would be below &quot;T&quot;a. In other words: we have produced a cooler. This is the basis of thermoacoustic cooling as shown in Fig. 2b which represents a thermoacoustic refrigerator. It has a loudspeaker at the left. The system corresponds with the left half of Fig. 1b with the stack in the position of the blue line. Cooling is produced at temperature &quot;T&quot;L.

It is also possible to fix the temperature of the right side of the plate at &quot;T&quot;a and heat up the left side so that the temperature gradient in the plate would be larger than the critical temperature gradient. In that case, we have made an engine (prime mover) which can e.g. produce sound as in Fig. 2a. This is a so-called thermoacoustic prime mover. Stacks can be made of stainless steel plates but the device works also very well with loosely packed stainless steel wool or screens. It is heated at the left, e.g., by a propane flame and heat is released to ambient temperature by a heat exchanger. If the temperature at the left side is high enough, the system starts to produces a loud sound.

Thermoacoustic engines still suffer from some limitations, including that:
* The device usually has low power-to-volume ratio.
* Very high densities of operating fluids are required to obtain high power densities
* The commercially available linear alternators used to convert acoustic energy into electricity currently have low efficiencies compared to rotary electric generators
* Only expensive specially-made alternators can give satisfactory performance.
* TAE uses gases at high pressures to provide reasonable power densities which imposes sealing challenges particularly if the mixture has light gases like helium.
* The heat exchanging process in TAE is critical to maintain the power conversion process. The hot heat exchanger has to transfer heat to the stack and the cold heat exchanger has to sustain the temperature gradient across the stack. Yet, the available space for it is constrained with the small size and the blockage it adds to the path of the wave. The heat exchange process in oscillating media is still under extensive research.
* The acoustic waves inside thermoacoustic engines operated at large pressure ratios suffer many kinds of non-linearities, such as turbulence which dissipates energy due to viscous effects, harmonic generation of different frequencies that carries acoustic power in frequencies other than the fundamental frequency. 
The performance of thermoacoustic engines usually is characterized through several indicators as follows:
* The first and second law efficiencies.
* The onset temperature difference, defined as the minimum temperature difference across the sides of the stack at which the dynamic pressure is generated.
* The frequency of the resultant pressure wave, since this frequency should match the resonance frequency required by the load device, either a thermoacoustic refrigerator/heat pump or a linear alternator.
* The degree of harmonic distortion, indicating the ratio of higher harmonics to the fundamental mode in the resulting dynamic pressure wave.
* The variation of the resultant wave frequency with the TAE operating temperature

===Travelling-wave systems===

Figure 3 is a schematic drawing of a travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine. It consists of a resonator tube and a loop which contains a regenerator, three heat exchangers, and a bypass loop. A regenerator is a porous medium with a high heat capacity. As the gas flows back and forth through the regenerator, it periodically stores and takes up heat from the regenerator material. In contrast to the stack, the pores in the regenerator are much smaller than the thermal penetration depth, so the thermal contact between gas and material is very good. Ideally, the energy flow in the regenerator is zero, so the main energy flow in the loop is from the hot heat exchanger via the pulse tube and the bypass loop to the heat exchanger at the other side of the regenerator (main heat exchanger). The energy in the loop is transported via a travelling wave as in Fig. 1c, hence the name travelling-wave systems. The ratio of the volume flows at the ends of the regenerator is &quot;T&quot;H/&quot;T&quot;a, so the regenerator acts as a volume-flow amplifier.
Just like in the case of the standing-wave system, the machine &quot;spontaneously&quot; produces sound if the temperature &quot;T&quot;H is high enough. The resulting pressure oscillations can be used in a variety of ways, such as in producing electricity, cooling, and heat pumping.

<doc id="642900" wikidata="Q730348" url="?curid=642900" title="Benny Urquidez">
<text>Benny Urquidez (born June 20, 1952) is an American former professional kickboxer, martial arts choreographer and actor. Nicknamed &quot;The Jet&quot;, Urquidez was a non-contact karate competitor who later pioneered full-contact fighting in the United States. He made the transition from point to full-contact karate in 1974, the year of its inception in the US, frequently fighting in bouts where the rules were ambiguous and contrasts in styles were dramatic. Urquidez is also known for once holding the rare achievement of six world titles in five different weight divisions, and remained largely undefeated in his 27-year career. His only loss came in a Muay Thai match which was shrouded in controversy, as Urquidez had only agreed to a no-decision exhibition, a clause which was ignored when the fight had ended.

Between 1974 and 1993, he amassed a documented professional record of 49–1–1 (win-loss-draw) with 35 knockouts and two controversial no-contests, although he is also supposed to have an additional record of 10–0–1 (10 KOs) in undocumented professional fights, making a total of 59–1–2–2 (45 KOs). However, sources vary with &quot;Ratings&quot; listing Urquidez as 63–0–1, (57 knockouts) and on his own official webpage, Urquidez lists his fight record as 200–0, and says he was 63–0, with 57 knockouts in title defenses. Also, he claims to have been undefeated in the &quot;Adult Black Belt Division&quot; prior to entering full-contact karate. &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine voted Urquidez &quot;Competitor of the Year&quot; in 1978. In 2019, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.

He has appeared in occasional acting roles, including the Jackie Chan movies &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1984) and &quot;Dragons Forever&quot; (1988), and played a hitman in George Armitage&#x27;s &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; (1997).

==Early life, family and education==
Urquidez was born in Los Angeles County, California, the son of a wrestling mother and a boxing father. His parents are of Spanish (Basque), Mexican and Blackfoot ancestry. He has said that his father was Spanish and his mother was Native American.

Benny began competing in 1958, at the age of five, in &quot;peewee&quot; boxing and wrestling in Los Angeles. His martial arts instruction started when he was seven years old; his first formal teacher was Bill Ryusaki. Urquidez received his black belt at the age of 14, a highly unusual feat in the 1960s. His siblings also achieved the rank of black belt. His sister Lilly Rodriguez was a pioneer in kickboxing for women, and their late brother Reuben Urquidez appeared with Benny in a documentary on the combination martial art budojujitsu.

==Career==
At the age of 12, Urquidez attended the Long Beach International Karate Championships in 1964. He witnessed a demonstration by Bruce Lee, including the one-inch punch which sent a 245-pound man flying back. This demonstration by Lee inspired a young Urqidez to start entering martial arts tournaments.

He entered the point circuit in 1964 and earned a reputation as a colorful fighter. At the 1972 Santa Monica Kempo Open, Urquidez lost in the finals to Brian Strian. In the 1973 Internationals, he fought John Natividad in what is considered one of the greatest non-contact bouts in history. In an unprecedented 25-point overtime match, Natividad won the match 13–12, receiving the Grand Title and the $2,500 purse. In May 1974, at the PAWAK Tournament, Urquidez lost a 4–1 decision to Joe Lewis. He also competed in England and Belgium as a member of Ed Parker&#x27;s 1974 US team. Also in 1974, he began his move away from the non-contact style by entering and winning the World Series of Martial Arts Championship, effectively a tough-man contest with few rules. Over the next two decades, he fought under various kickboxing organizations (NKL, WPKO, Professional Karate Association (PKA), World Kickboxing Association (WKA), AJKBA, Shin-Kakutojutsu Federation, NJPW and MTN) to amass a record of 58 wins with no losses. This undefeated record, though official, is controversial and highly disputed.

In 1977, Urquidez traveled to Japan and fought under the WKA&#x27;s compromise US–Japan rules which included leg kicks and knees to the body. He defeated Katsuyuki Suzuki by KO in the 6th round (August 1977) as part of the professional wrestling event in which Antonio Inoki fought Everett Eddy in what was said to be a wrestler/karate fighter mixed match but was a pre-determined pro wrestling match. The Suzuki fight materialized because the newly formed WKA organization could not compete against the PKA in the US. At the same time, Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki, who gained the worldwide fame by fighting Muhammad Ali in the controversial 1976 boxer/wrestler mixed-match in Japan, had been looking for new opponents for what he called the world martial arts championship series. Eventually, promoter Ron Holmes discovered Everett Eddy for Inoki. By that time, Eddy had been coached by Arnold Urquidez, and lost in a knockout in the 1st round to PKA world heavyweight champion Ross Scott in the previous year. In the same event, Benny Urquidez knocked out Howard Jackson, but soon his lightweight title was stripped by the PKA, and so both Eddy and Urquidez had no action in the US, and had to look for fights overseas. Even though the Inoki/Eddy bout was successful, it was the fight between Urquidez and Suzuki, which shocked Japan, where Japanese kickboxing had been very popular. Though never tested for or achieved any rank in Japanese karate, Urquidez has decided to bestow upon himself the title of &quot;sensei&quot;, a Japanese honorific term which is given to experts and instructors meaning: &quot;someone who precedes you in knowledge&quot;.

The All-Japan Kickboxing Association, for which Suzuki had been rated as No. 2, became interested in the American sport of full-contact karate, decided to promote series of mixed-rules bouts between the American full-contact karate fighters and Japanese kickboxers. On November 14, 1977, the AJKF held the first of such event which featured Benny Urquidez, his brother-in-law Blinky Rodriguez, Marc Costello, Brendan Leddy, Tony Lopez, Leonard Galiza and Freddy Avila. Only Benny Urquidez and Costello came out as the winners for the American team. Urquidez&#x27;s victory over Kunimitsu Okao convinced the Japanese fight fans, and eventually began to be featured as the central figure for what was supposed to be the documentary comic book, &quot;The Square Ring&quot;, until he declined to avenge his loss against the Thai opponent Prayout Sittiboonlert. Urquidez&#x27;s second loss came in August 1980 in Florida. American Billye Jackson dominated seven rounds including knocking Urquidez down. Urquidez protested the decision and petitioned the WKA&#x27;s Howard Hansen to classify it as a no-contest.

After 1980, Urquidez&#x27; ring appearances became less frequent. Between 1981 and 1984 he fought only sporadically. In 1984, he fought Ivan Sprang in Amsterdam under modified Muay Thai rules (no elbows), winning by 6th-round TKO. His ring career largely came to a halt after 1985, and he retired after facing Yoshihisa Tagami at the age of 41. Subsequently, Urquidez became devoted to acting, teaching kickboxing and martial arts choreography. Urquidez&#x27;s late brother Reuben was also a competitive martial artist and actor; they appeared together in a 1982 training video, &quot;World Of Martial Arts&quot;, along with Steve Sanders (karate), Chuck Norris and John Saxon. Van Halen lead singer David Lee Roth dedicated the band&#x27;s hit 1984 song &quot;Jump&quot; to Urquidez, of whom Roth was a student.

In 2000, Urquidez and Emil Farkas founded the Los Angeles Film Fighting Institute, which was one of the first schools of its kind in the United States to teach martial artists the intricacies of stunt work.

Urquidez has had training in nine styles: Judo, Kajukenbo, Shotokan, Taekwondo, Lima Lama, White Crane Kung Fu, Jujutsu, Aikido and American Kenpo. He is the founder of Ukidokan Karate. He continued to teach at The Jets Gym in North Hollywood, California. Urquidez has also authored various instructional books and videos. He also has a special friendship with actor/client John Cusack with whom talks of opening up a bigger gym in Santa Monica, targeting former champions as clients and trainers are in the works as Cusack has shown interest in taking part as co-owner. The Jets Gym in the North Hollywood location closed in 2007, to make way for a shopping mall. Today, he is still very active teaching privately, and working as a stunt coordinator in the entertainment business. He teaches ukidokan kickboxing at Team Karate Center in Woodland Hills, California.

== Controversies ==
=== Varied fights ===
Benny Urquidez was the first kickboxing champion with an international profile who also operated as a free agent under different rules for different sanctions. Consequently, he fought in several unorthodox match-ups and hotly disputed bouts. In late 1974, in the grand finale of an early mixed martial arts-style tough man contest in Honolulu, Hawaii, a , Urquidez decisioned a , Dana Goodson after scoring a takedown and pin against Goodson in the third and final round.

A year later, in Detroit, Urquidez was disqualified for knocking out his opponent with a fourth punch under the subsequently-discontinued three-punch rule. The disqualifying referee was the opponent&#x27;s own karate instructor. The bout was excoriated on network television, prompting state athletic commissions across the United States to become interested in regulating the sport. Chuck Norris&#x27; short-lived International Karate League (IKL) and later the STAR System world ratings reversed this outcome.

Another three bouts were eventually ruled no-contests (NC). The first, in Los Angeles on March 12, 1977, was a nine-round NC (WKA) against Thai boxer Narongnoi Kiatbandit as part of the inaugural WKA world title event. Urquidez scored flash-knockdowns against Narongnoi in rounds three and six as well as five legal throws over three other rounds. Narongnoi was warned for illegal knee kicks and groin attacks on four occasions before being assessed with a point deduction in round nine. However, the point deduction came shortly after Narongnoi had scored his sole flash-knockdown which, in turn, provoked a riot among Muay Thai fans in the audience. The audience invaded the ring moments before the final bell. Scores were never collected for round nine. The California State Athletic Commission declared the no-contest.

Next, on April 29, 1978, Urquidez faced his fourth Japanese opponent Shinobu Onuki in Tokyo; the event was co-promoted by the AJKBA and Shin-Kakutojutsu Federation. Eventually, Urquidez executed a throw that dislocated Onuki&#x27;s shoulder. Initially, because of the throw, Urquidez was given a TKO loss, however, the promoters acknowledged that Urquidez used the throw without knowing it was illegal under Japanese rules; the bout was then scored as a no-contest. Following this unsatisfactory result, the two faced each other again in Las Vegas on January 2, 1980. The fight was aired by NBC, and this time Urquidez knocked out Onuki with a left hook to the body. Later, in October 1981, when the AJKBA merged with the WKA, the WKA transmuted the original Onuki no-contest to a TKO victory for Urquidez because, in fact, Urquidez&#x27;s fight contract had permitted throws.

Third, Urquidez fought to a seven-round NC (WKA) against Billye Jackson in West Palm Beach, Florida, on August 8, 1980. This non-title fight was first reported as a seven-round decision for Jackson; then was changed to a seven-round technical draw, and then to a no-contest. The WKA waited until March 1986 to unambiguously transmute this outcome owing to uneven glove assignments and a coerced last-minute rule change that unfairly affected Urquidez&#x27;s performance in an otherwise close bout. Despite multiple attempts to reschedule a rematch to settle the dispute Urquidez refused to fight Jackson. The no-contest status of these fights has been corroborated in print by Paul Maslak (Chief Administrator of the STAR System world ratings). As a side note, the WKA and Star system ratings were owned and operated by Urquidez brother, Arnold.

Meanwhile, on August 2, 1978, Urquidez faced the then fifth-ranked welterweight Thai boxer, Prayout Sittiboonlert, in Tokyo as part of the Shin-Kakutojutsu Organization&#x27;s first independent event. The rules for the bout included six two-minute rounds, one-minute intervals, and no elbow contact as per agreement with Urquidez. Urquidez lost a heart-stopping decision to the Thai, who controlled the fight with relentless knee attacks and through the masterful use of Thai clinches. Afterward, Urquidez claimed he had been maneuvered into a competitive bout under unaccustomed &quot;new rules&quot; through deliberate misrepresentations. A rematch was set on October 30, 1978, at the Budokan (Martial Arts Hall) as part of the five world championships card for the Shin-Kakutojutsu Organization. However, for unknown reasons, Urquidez canceled the fight on the day of the event. According to one report, Urquidez did travel to Japan, but was unable to recover sufficiently from a high fever which he contracted from an allergic reaction to pain medication being used to treat a lingering left knuckle injury. This sanctioning organization was among several discontinued in 1981 for alleged ties to organized crime. Both the WKA and the STAR world ratings regarded this bout as muay Thai, a separate sport, and did not include it as part of Urquidez&#x27;s rankings and record count for kickboxing.

After a six-year absence from the Japanese ring, Urquidez agreed to fight an exhibition against Nobuya Asuka on April 24, 1989, at the Tokyo Dome as part of the New Japan Pro-Wrestling event. The rules of the bout were five rounds at two-minutes each, one-minute intervals and without elbow or knee contact to the head. Additionally, it was established that, if the fight went the distance, it would automatically be scored as a draw. The bout did go five rounds without knockout or disqualification and a no-decision was immediately declared.

After another four-year absence on December 4, 1993, in &quot;The Legend&#x27;s Final Challenge&quot; at the Mirage Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, Urquidez fought Japanese champion Yoshihisa Tagami to establish the vacant WKA super welterweight world title. Despite having injured his left wrist in training, Urquidez proceeded with the bout and narrowly defeated his equally aggressive opponent with kicking attacks. Urquidez slipped to the canvas in round two; and Tagami scored a clean flash knockdown in round nine. Neither contestant was ever in serious trouble. The bout ended in a split decision, two judges scoring for Urquidez, one for Tagami.

=== Gracie Challenge ===
In September 1994, Urquidez revealed he had been challenged by Rorion Gracie for a mixed martial arts bout as part of the Gracie Challenge. He claimed to have backed down from the fight, considering it to be just a promotional stunt, due to Rorion demanding to fight for free after having negotiated for a fight purse. In response, in November of the same year, Rorion&#x27;s brother Royce Gracie challenged Urquidez himself, which Benny rejected on the grounds of being retired.

Months later, Royce Gracie wrote an attack piece printed in &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine titled &quot;Message for Urquidez: Actions Speak Louder Than Words&quot; in which he voiced his issues with Urquidez, criticizing Urquidez for not submitting to the Gracies&#x27; demands for a fight; Gracie alleged that Rorion had dominated Urquidez in a training bout at Urquidez&#x27;s Jet Center gym in 1978, taking him down &quot;several times&quot; without being touched. Although Gracie went on to state that &quot;that&#x27;s how the whole Gracie rivalry with Benny started&quot;, he went on to accuse Urquidez of having said he would &quot;help Rorion&quot;, but not following through on the offer. He also claimed Urquidez only wanted to fight under kickboxing rules, to lessen the chance of being defeated, and that Rorion refused on the grounds that he was &quot;not a kickboxer&quot;. None of Gracie&#x27;s claims were independently verified.

==Movie roles==
Urquidez has played a number of roles in various martial arts movies. The first was &quot;&quot; (1981), starring Joe Lewis and Bong Soo Han. Later, he made two movies with Jackie Chan, &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1984) and &quot;Dragons Forever&quot; (1988), wherein he fights against the characters played by Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. Urquidez is depicted as a relentlessly tough opponent who is defeated in the climactic fight scenes of both movies. His final fight with Chan in &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; is considered to be among the finest fights of Chan&#x27;s career, including by Chan himself.

Urquidez cameoed as a kickboxer in the Troma film &quot;Ragin&#x27; Cajun&quot;. The movie, filmed in 1988 and released in 1991, wrongfully asserted that it featured Urquidez&#x27;s first film appearance, stating in the opening credits, &quot;Introducing Benny &#x27;The Jet&#x27; Urquidez&quot;. He appeared in the 1989 film &quot;Roadhouse&quot; as one of the fighters seen at a car dealership which is partially destroyed in elaborately choreographed mayhem. He trained Patrick Swayze in his own fighting techniques for the film. Urquidez appears in the 1991 film &quot;Blood Match&quot;, and in 1992, he played a referee in the James Woods and Louis Gossett Jr. film &quot;Diggstown&quot;. He has a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1994), playing one of several prisoners put in a truck with Ken, Ryu, Sagat and Vega. Urquidez was also responsible for the physical training of most of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; cast. He was set to play a different character in the franchise, Raven, in a game based on the movie, but the character was later scrapped.

Urquidez performed in the film &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; (1997) as Felix La Poubelle, a hitman sent to kill a character played by John Cusack. He appeared in &quot;1408&quot; (2007) as a spectral killer with a hammer, again with Cusack. Urquidez is Cusack&#x27;s long-time kickboxing trainer. Urquidez also appeared as one of several thugs who accost Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s character in the first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film during an attempted robbery; Urquidez plays the thug wearing a black-and-white-striped T-shirt who makes kissing noises at Dunst.

He was a fight coordinator for an episode of the television drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;The Bittersweet Science&quot; (season 7, episode 10), and also appears in the episode in a 30-second role as an underground MMA referee.

<text>A photomask (also simply called a mask) is an opaque plate with transparent areas that allow light to shine through in a defined pattern. Photomasks are commonly used in photolithography for the production of integrated circuits (ICs or &quot;chips&quot;) to produce a pattern on a thin wafer of material (usually silicon). In semiconductor manufacturing, a mask is sometimes called a reticle.

In photolithography, several masks are used in turn, each one reproducing a layer of the completed design, and together known as a mask set. A curvilinear photomask has patterns with curves, which is a departure from conventional photomasks which only have patterns that are completely vertical or horizontal, known as manhattan geometry. These photomasks require special equipment to manufacture.

== History ==
For IC production in the 1960s and early 1970s, an opaque rubylith film laminated onto a transparent mylar sheet was used. The design of one layer was cut into the rubylith, initially by hand on an illuminated drafting table (later by machine (plotter)) and the unwanted rubylith was peeled off by hand, forming the master image of that layer of the chip, often called &quot;artwork&quot;. Increasingly complex and thus larger chips required larger and larger rubyliths, eventually even filling the wall of a room, and artworks were to be photographically reduced to produce photomasks (Eventually this whole process was replaced by the optical pattern generator to produce the master image). At this point the master image could be arrayed into a multi-chip image called a reticle. The reticle was originally a 10X larger image of a single chip.

The reticle was by step-and-repeater photolithography and etching used to produce a photomask with image-size the same as the final chip. The photomask might be used directly in the fab or be used as master-photomask to produce the final actual working photomasks.

As feature size shrank, the only way to properly focus the image was to place it in direct contact with the wafer. These contact aligners often lifted some of the photoresist off the wafer and onto the photomask and it had to be cleaned or discarded. This drove the adoption of reverse master photomasks (see above), which were used to produce (with contact photolithography and etching) the needed many actual working photomasks. Later, projection photo-lithography meant photomask lifetime was indefinite. Still later direct-step-on-wafer &quot;stepper&quot; photo-lithography used reticles directly and ended the use of photomasks.

Photomask materials changed over time. Initially soda glass was used with silver halide opacity. Later borosilicate and then fused silica to control expansion, and chromium which has better opacity to ultraviolet light were introduced. The original pattern generators have since been replaced by electron beam lithography and laser-driven mask writer or maskless lithography systems which generate reticles directly from the original computerized design.

== Overview ==

Lithographic photomasks are typically transparent fused silica plates covered with a pattern defined with a chromium (Cr) or Fe2O3 metal absorbing film. Photomasks are used at wavelengths of 365 nm, 248 nm, and 193 nm. Photomasks have also been developed for other forms of radiation such as 157 nm, 13.5 nm (EUV), X-ray, electrons, and ions; but these require entirely new materials for the substrate and the pattern film.

A set of photomasks, each defining a pattern layer in integrated circuit fabrication, is fed into a photolithography stepper or scanner, and individually selected for exposure. In multi-patterning techniques, a photomask would correspond to a subset of the layer pattern.

Historically in photolithography for the mass production of integrated circuit devices, there was a distinction between the term photoreticle or simply reticle, and the term photomask. In the case of a photomask, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the mask pattern and the wafer pattern. The mask covered the entire surface of the wafer which was exposed in its entirety in one shot. This was the standard for the 1:1 mask aligners that were succeeded by steppers and scanners with reduction optics. As used in steppers and scanners which use image projection, the reticle commonly contains only one copy, also called one layer of the designed VLSI circuit. (However, some photolithography fabrications utilize reticles with more than one layer placed side by side onto the same mask, used as copies to create several identical integrated circuits from one photomask). In modern usage, the terms reticle and photomask are synonymous.

In a modern stepper or scanner, the pattern in the photomask is projected and shrunk by four or five times onto the wafer surface. To achieve complete wafer coverage, the wafer is repeatedly &quot;stepped&quot; from position to position under the optical column or the stepper lens until full exposure of the wafer is achieved. A photomask with several copies of the integrated circuit design is used to reduce the number of steppings required to expose the entire wafer, thus increasing productivity.

Features 150 nm or below in size generally require phase-shifting to enhance the image quality to acceptable values. This can be achieved in many ways. The two most common methods are to use an attenuated phase-shifting background film on the mask to increase the contrast of small intensity peaks, or to etch the exposed quartz so that the edge between the etched and unetched areas can be used to image nearly zero intensity. In the second case, unwanted edges would need to be trimmed out with another exposure. The former method is &quot;attenuated phase-shifting&quot;, and is often considered a weak enhancement, requiring special illumination for the most enhancement, while the latter method is known as &quot;alternating-aperture phase-shifting&quot;, and is the most popular strong enhancement technique.

As leading-edge semiconductor features shrink, photomask features that are 4× larger must inevitably shrink as well. This could pose challenges since the absorber film will need to become thinner, and hence less opaque.
A 2005 study by IMEC found that thinner absorbers degrade image contrast and therefore contribute to line-edge roughness, using state-of-the-art photolithography tools.
One possibility is to eliminate absorbers altogether and use &quot;chromeless&quot; masks, relying solely on phase-shifting for imaging.

The emergence of immersion lithography has a strong impact on photomask requirements. The commonly used attenuated phase-shifting mask is more sensitive to the higher incidence angles applied in &quot;hyper-NA&quot; lithography, due to the longer optical path through the patterned film. During manufacturing, inspection using a special form of microscopy called CD-SEM (Critical-Dimension Scanning Electron Microscopy) is used to measure critical dimensions on photomasks which are the dimensions of the patterns on a photomask.

=== EUV lithography ===
EUV photomasks work by reflecting light, which is achieved by using multiple alternating layers of molybdenum and silicon.

== Mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) ==
Leading-edge photomasks (pre-corrected) images of the final chip patterns are magnified by four times. This magnification factor has been a key benefit in reducing pattern sensitivity to imaging errors. However, as features continue to shrink, two trends come into play: the first is that the mask error factor begins to exceed one, i.e., the dimension error on the wafer may be more than 1/4 the dimension error on the mask, and the second is that the mask feature is becoming smaller, and the dimension tolerance is approaching a few nanometers. For example, a 25 nm wafer pattern should correspond to a 100 nm mask pattern, but the wafer tolerance could be 1.25 nm (5% spec), which translates into 5 nm on the photomask. The variation of electron beam scattering in directly writing the photomask pattern can easily well exceed this.

==Pellicles==
The term &quot;pellicle&quot; is used to mean &quot;film&quot;, &quot;thin film&quot;, or &quot;membrane.&quot; Beginning in the 1960s, thin film stretched on a metal frame, also known as a &quot;pellicle&quot;, was used as a beam splitter for optical instruments. It has been used in a number of instruments to split a beam of light without causing an optical path shift due to its small film thickness. In 1978, Shea et al. at IBM patented a process to use the &quot;pellicle&quot; as a dust cover to protect a photomask or reticle. In the context of this entry, &quot;pellicle&quot; means &quot;thin film dust cover to protect a photomask&quot;.

Particle contamination can be a significant problem in semiconductor manufacturing. A photomask is protected from particles by a pelliclea thin transparent film stretched over a frame that is glued over one side of the photomask. The pellicle is far enough away from the mask patterns so that moderate-to-small sized particles that land on the pellicle will be too far out of focus to print. Although they are designed to keep particles away, pellicles become a part of the imaging system and their optical properties need to be taken into account. Pellicles material are Nitrocellulose and made for various Transmission Wavelengths. Current pellicles are made from polysilicon, and companies are exploring other materials for high-NA EUV and future chip making processes. 
== Leading commercial photomask manufacturers ==

The SPIE Annual Conference, Photomask Technology reports the SEMATECH Mask Industry Assessment which includes current industry analysis and the results of their annual photomask manufacturers survey.
The following companies are listed in order of their global market share (2009 info):

* Dai Nippon Printing
* Toppan Photomasks
* Photronics Inc
* Hoya Corporation
* Taiwan Mask Corporation
* Compugraphics

Major chipmakers such as Intel, Globalfoundries, IBM, NEC, TSMC, UMC, Samsung, and Micron Technology, have their own large maskmaking facilities or joint ventures with the abovementioned companies.

The worldwide photomask market was estimated as $3.2 billion in 2012 and $3.1 billion in 2013. Almost half of the market was from captive mask shops (in-house mask shops of major chipmakers).

The costs of creating new mask shop for 180 nm processes were estimated in 2005 as $40 million, and for 130 nm - more than $100 million.

The purchase price of a photomask, in 2006, could range from $250 to $100,000 for a single high-end phase-shift mask. As many as 30 masks (of varying price) may be required to form a complete mask set. As modern chips are built in several layers stacked on top of each other, at least one mask is required for each of these layers.

<doc id="642904" wikidata="Q2408040" url="?curid=642904" title="Jules Quicherat">
<text>Jules Étienne Joseph Quicherat (13 October 1814 – 8 April 1882) was a French historian and archaeologist.

His father, a working cabinet-maker, came from Paray-le-Monial to Paris to support his large family; Quicherat was born there. He was fifteen years younger than his brother Louis, a great Latin scholar and lexicographer, who survived him. Although very poor, he was admitted to the College of Sainte-Barbe, where he received a thorough classical education. He showed his gratitude to this establishment by writing its history in three volumes, published between 1860 and 1864. At the end of his studies, he hesitated for some time before deciding what career to follow until Jules Michelet ended his indecision by inspiring him with a taste for history.

In 1835, Quicherat entered the École des Chartes; he left two years later at the head of the college. Once more inspired by the example of Michelet, who had just written an admirable work on Joan of Arc, he published the text of the two trials of Joan, adding much contemporary evidence on her heroism in his &#x27; (5 vols. 1841-1849), as well as half a volume of&#x27;, in which it seems that the last word has been said on important points.

From the 15th century, he drew other inspirations. In 1844, he published memoirs of the adventures of a brigand, Rodrigue de Villandrando, which gradually grew into a volume full of fresh matter. He wrote full biographies of two chroniclers of Louis XI, one very obscure, Jean Castel, and the other, Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux, who was, on the contrary, a remarkable politician, prelate, and chronicler. Between 1855 and 1859, Quicherat published the latter&#x27;s works, most of which were now brought out for the first time. In addition to these he wrote &quot;Fragments inédits de Georges Chastellain&quot; and &quot;Lettres, mémoires et autres documents relatifs à la guerre du bien public en 1465&quot;.

These works did not wholly occupy his time: in 1847, he inaugurated a course of archaeological lectures at the École des Chartes, and in 1849, was appointed professor of diplomatics at the same college. His teaching had exceptional results. Although he was not eloquent and had a nasal voice, his hearers were loath to miss any of his thoughtful teachings, which were unbiased and well-expressed. Of his lectures, the public saw only some articles on special subjects, which were distributed in several reviews. Note should be made of a short treatise on &#x27; published in 1867, and a memoir&#x27; published in 1850, where he gives his theory on the use of stone arches important for the history of religious architecture. In an 1874 article on &quot;, he declared an exact date for the birth of Gothic architecture.

Following the advice of his friends, he began to transcribe his lectures on archaeology towards the end of his life. Still, only the introductory chapters, up to the 11th century, were found among his papers. On the other hand, the pupils trained by him circulated his principles throughout France, recognizing him as the founder of national archaeology. At one point, he seems to have taken a false step; with a warmth and pertinacity worthy of a better cause, he maintained the identity of Caesar&#x27;s Alesia with Alaise, and he died without becoming a convert to the opinion, now almost universally accepted, that Alise Sainte-Reine is the place where Vercingetorix capitulated. But even this error benefited science; some well-directed excavations at Alaise brought many Roman remains to light, which were subsequently sent to enrich the museum at Besançon.

After 1871, his course of lectures on diplomatics having been given up, Quicherat, still a professor of archaeology, was nominated director of the Ecole des Chartes. He filled this post with the same energy he had shown in the many scientific commissions he had taken part in. In 1878, he gave up his duties as professor, which then fell to the most conspicuous of his pupils, Robert de Lasteyrie. He died suddenly in Paris on April 8, 1882, a short time after correcting the proofs of &quot;, published in the Revue Historique.

After his death, it was decided to bring out his hitherto unpublished papers; among these are some important fragments of his archaeological lectures, but his &quot;&quot;, with which he was occupied for many years, is missing.

<text>Stanley Patrick Johnson (born 18 August 1940) is a British-French author of Ottoman descent, and former politician who was Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Wight and Hampshire East from 1979 to 1984. A former employee of the World Bank and the European Commission, he has written books on environmental and population issues. His six children include Boris Johnson, who was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 2019 to 2022. He is a former member of the Conservative Party.

==Personal life ==
Stanley Johnson was born in 1940 in Penzance, Cornwall, the son of Osman Kemal (1909–1992) (later known as Wilfred Johnson) and Irene Williams (1907–1987) (daughter of Stanley Fred Williams of Bromley, Kent, who was the grandson of Sir George Williams, and Marie Louise de Pfeffel). His paternal grandfather, Ali Kemal Bey, one of the last interior ministers of the Ottoman government, was assassinated in 1922 during the Turkish War of Independence. Stanley&#x27;s father was born in 1909 in Bournemouth, and his birth was registered as Osman Ali Wilfred Kemal. Osman&#x27;s Anglo-Swiss mother Winifred Brun died shortly after giving birth. Ali Kemal returned to the Ottoman Empire in 1912, whereafter Osman Wilfred and his sister Selma were brought up by their English grandmother, Margaret Brun, and took her maiden name, Johnson, Stanley&#x27;s father thus becoming Wilfred Johnson.

Johnson&#x27;s maternal grandmother&#x27;s parents were Hubert Freiherr von Pfeffel (born in Munich in the Kingdom of Bavaria on 8 December 1843) and his wife Hélène Arnous-Rivière (born on 14 January 1862). Hubert von Pfeffel was the son of Karl Freiherr von Pfeffel (born in Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony on 22 November 1811; died in Munich on 25 January 1890) by his marriage in Augsburg on 16 February 1836 to Karolina von Rothenburg (born in the Free City of Frankfurt on 28 November 1805; died in Frankfurt on 13 February 1872), herself said to be the illegitimate daughter of Prince Paul of Württemberg by Friederike Porth.

Stanley Johnson attended Sherborne School, Dorset. While still an undergraduate studying English at Exeter College, Oxford, he took part in the Marco Polo Expedition with Tim Severin and Michael de Larrabeiti, travelling on a motorcycle and sidecar from Oxford to Venice and on to India and Afghanistan. The adventure led to the publication of Severin&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;Tracking Marco Polo&quot;, with photographs by de Larrabeiti.

Johnson started studying at Columbia University in 1963, but dropped out after a year. While at Columbia he married the painter Charlotte Fawcett in Marylebone, with whom he had four children: Boris, former Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; Rachel, journalist and former editor-in-chief of &quot;The Lady&quot;; Jo, former Conservative MP for Orpington, former Minister of State for Universities, and former Head of the Lex Column at the &quot;Financial Times&quot;; and Leo, film-maker and entrepreneur. Johnson and Fawcett divorced in 1979. Johnson married Jennifer Kidd in Westminster in 1981, and they had two children, Julia and Maximilian.

In July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson posted pictures on Instagram of himself travelling to Athens, Greece. He was criticised by Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone for travelling at a time when guidance under lockdown was to avoid &quot;all but essential international travel&quot;. At the time, Greece had reopened its borders but banned direct travel from the United Kingdom; Johnson had circumvented Greece&#x27;s rules by travelling via Bulgaria.

In December 2020, Johnson said that he was applying for a French passport as his mother and her parents were French. After subsequently being awarded French citizenship Johnson stated that he was delighted.

==Career==

Johnson was the recipient of a United States, Harkness Fellowship and was then employed at the World Bank in Washington during the 1960s. He went on to become the Head of Prevention of Pollution Division at the European Commission (EC) in Brussels from 1973, acting briefly as advisor to the head of ECPS in May 1979, before taking a leave of absence a month later. He resumed his former role with the EC in 1984, until taking a second leave of absence in 1990, this time to work in the field of international environmental policy. He retired early from the EC in 1994. 

=== Politics ===
From June 1979–1984 Johnson served as the elected Conservative Party MEP (95,000 majority) representing the area of Hants East and the Isle of Wight.

At the 2005 general election, Johnson stood for the Conservative Party in the constituency of Teignbridge, where he came second behind Liberal Democrat Richard Younger-Ross.

In May 2008, Johnson hoped to be selected to contest his son Boris&#x27;s parliamentary seat of Henley for the Conservative Party, but local councillor John Howell was the candidate selected.

Having supported the Remain campaign during the 2016 European Union membership referendum, in October 2017 he came out in support of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, stating that &quot;the time has come to bail out&quot; and cited the approach and attitude of the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker as a major factor in his change of mind.

=== Books and other writing ===
He has published a number of books dealing with environmental issues and nine novels, including &quot;The Commissioner&quot;, which was made into a 1998 film starring John Hurt. In 1962 he won the Newdigate Prize for Poetry.

For a time, starting on 26 May 2005, he wrote a weekly column for the &quot;G2&quot; section of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and continued to write for various newspapers and magazines, often on environmental topics.

He wrote a memoir, &quot;Stanley I Presume&quot;, published in March 2009.

His 2015 novel &quot;The Virus&quot; is a thriller about the rise of a mysterious virus and the fight to stop a deadly pandemic.

=== Television ===
He was one of the first regular hosts of the late night discussion programme &quot;The Last Word&quot; on Channel 4&#x27;s More4 channel, and made an appearance on &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; on 7 May 2004.

In November 2017, Johnson was confirmed as a contestant for the seventeenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, finishing in seventh place. In 2018 he appeared on the BBC programme &quot;The Real Marigold Hotel&quot; with eight other celebrities. In February 2020 he appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Antiques Road Trip&quot;.

=== Awards ===
In 1983 he received the RSPCA Richard Martin Award for Outstanding Services to animal welfare. He was for many years an ambassador for the UNEP Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals based in Bonn, Germany.

In October 2015 Johnson was awarded the RSPB Medal by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds for his role in the creation of one of the cornerstones of Europe&#x27;s nature conservation policy – the Habitats Directive (1992).

In December 2015 he received the World Wide Fund for Nature Leader for a Living Planet Award.

== Public statements ==
In August 2018, Johnson said his son Boris Johnson&#x27;s comments that Muslim women who wear burkas look like &quot;letterboxes&quot; and &quot;bank robbers&quot; did not go far enough, and that criticism of the comments had been &quot;synthetic indignation&quot; created by political opponents.

In June 2022, ahead of Johnson&#x27;s visit to China for a television programme on the explorer Marco Polo, Johnson called for the UK parliament to lift a ban on the Chinese ambassador to the UK entering the parliamentary estate.

== Allegations of spousal abuse and inappropriate touching ==
Biographer Tom Bower records in an interview with his first wife Charlotte Fawcett that &#x27;he hit me many times, over many years&#x27;. She said of a 1970s incident &quot;He broke my nose. He made me feel like I deserved it. I want the truth to be told.&quot;

On 15 November 2021, Caroline Nokes accused Johnson of inappropriately touching her at the Conservative Party conference in Blackpool in 2003. Johnson said that he had &quot;no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all&quot;. Following this, journalist Ailbhe Rea accused Johnson of groping her at the 2019 Conservative Party conference.

<doc id="642925" wikidata="Q7295336" url="?curid=642925" title="Rasul v. Bush">
<text>Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that foreign nationals held in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp could petition federal courts for writs of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to review the legality of their detention. The Court&#x27;s 6–3 judgment on June 28, 2004, reversed a D.C. Circuit decision which had held that the judiciary has no jurisdiction to hear any petitions from foreign nationals held in Guantanamo Bay.

The lead petitioner, British citizen Shafiq Rasul, was one of the Tipton Three. The U.S. transported the three men to the United Kingdom in March 2004 before the decision was handed down, and the government released them the next day.

== Background ==
===Military order===
On September 14, 2001, Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, giving the President of the United States broad powers to prosecute a Global War on Terror in response to the September 11 attacks. Secretary of State Colin Powell and State Department Legal Advisor William Howard Taft IV advised that the President must observe the Geneva Conventions. Colonel Lawrence Morris proposed holding public hearings modeled on the Nuremberg trials. Major General Thomas Romig, the Judge Advocate General of the United States Army, recommended any new military tribunals be modeled on existing courts-martial.

However, Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Jay Bybee, relying on the unitary executive theory developed by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo, advised the President in a series of memos that he could hold enemy combatants abroad, indefinitely, without Congressional oversight, and free from judicial review. On November 13, 2001, President George W. Bush signed a military order titled the Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism, which sought to detain and try enemy combatants by military commissions under Presidential authority alone.

=== Capture and detainment ===
The various plaintiffs were taken to Guantanamo Bay for different reasons, but were generally captured or arrested during the United States invasion of Afghanistan.

The U.S. military transferred Rasul and Asif Iqbal, both British citizens, and David Hicks, an Australian citizen, to Guantanamo Bay in December 2001. Each denied voluntarily joining any terrorist forces. As noted by the District Court, they did not deny having fought for the Taliban, but claimed that if they &quot;did&quot; take up arms, it was only when being attacked and in self-defense. Rasul and Iqbal say they were with the Taliban because they were taken captive. Hicks is silent on the matter in court filings, but his father, in filing the brief, said that he believed that his son had joined the Taliban forces.

The twelve Kuwaitis, combined in &quot;Al Odah v. United States,&quot; claimed that they were in Pakistan and Afghanistan giving humanitarian aid. They were seized by villagers seeking bounties and &quot;sold&quot; to the United States (US) forces. The US transferred them to Guantanamo Bay starting in January 2002.

Mamdouh Habib, the plaintiff in &quot;Habib v. Bush,&quot; was arrested by Pakistani authorities on October 5, 2001, two days before the fighting began.

== Procedural history ==
===Court petitions===
The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) was the first organization to file two petitions, &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; and &quot;Habib v. Bush&quot;, challenging the U.S. government&#x27;s practice of holding foreign nationals in detention indefinitely who were captured in Afghanistan during the war against the Taliban regime and al-Qaida. The government had designated the detainees as enemy combatants and did not allow them access to counsel, the right to a trial, or knowledge of the charges against them.

On February 19, 2002, Guantanamo detainee Shafiq Rasul, a British citizen, petitioned in federal court for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to review the legality of his detention. Guantanamo detainee Mamdouh Habib, an Australian citizen, also filed a petition.

These cases were each filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the court decided them together, consolidating them under &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot;. Each of the filings alleged that the government had not allowed the detainee to speak at all to friends, family or lawyers, and had not given him any hearing whatsoever on the question of whether he was an enemy combatant in the war.

=== U.S. District Court ===
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied the detainees&#x27; petitions on July 30, 2002, finding that aliens in Cuba had no access to U.S. courts.

Citing &quot;Johnson v. Eisentrager&quot;, , in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that U.S. courts had no jurisdiction over German war criminals held in a U.S.-administered German prison, the District Court ruled that U.S. courts have jurisdiction only in a territory where the U.S. has sovereignty. Because the lease with Cuba regarding Guantanamo Bay stated that Cuba technically has &quot;ultimate sovereignty&quot;, the court held Guantanamo Bay could not be considered a sovereign territory of the United States and therefore foreign nationals could not be given a trial in the U.S. The plaintiffs pointed out that the U.S. has all effective powers in the area.

===U.S. Court of Appeals===
In &quot;Al Odah v. United States&quot; a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit including Judge A. Raymond Randolph, Judge Merrick Garland, and Judge Stephen F. Williams affirmed on March 11, 2003.

== Supreme Court ==
The Supreme Court of the United States, over the Government&#x27;s objections, agreed in November 2003 to hear the cases of the Guantánamo detainees, namely &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot;, which was consolidated with &quot;al Odah v. Bush&quot; (the latter represented twelve Kuwaiti men).

===Release of Rasul and Iqbal===
On March 9, 2004, two years after they were first detained, the U.S. released Rasul and Iqbal to the United Kingdom with no charges filed, along with three other British citizen detainees. The British government had been pressing the United States for the return of its citizens and legal residents. The next day, the UK government released all five men without charge.

===Oral arguments===
One-hour of oral arguments were heard on April 20, where former-Circuit Chief Judge John Joseph Gibbons appeared for the detainees and Theodore Olson, the Solicitor General of the United States, appeared for the Government.

During the oral arguments the following points came up:
* Many of the Justices&#x27; questions indicated a belief that &quot;Johnson v. Eisentrager&quot; was immaterial to the jurisdictional question at hand, while the government argued that it was material. Justice Stevens noted that the &quot;Ahrens v. Clark&quot; decision, the basis of the Eisentrager decision, had since been largely reversed in Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky (1973), and thus relevant parts of Eisentrager may no longer apply.
* Justice Souter noted that the ability of a U.S. citizen to get a trial may necessarily imply that the court has jurisdiction in that geographic area, since jurisdiction is largely a geographic and sovereignty matter. Since the government had said it would not challenge &#x27;habeas corpus&#x27; by a U.S. citizen in Guantanamo Bay, in &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot; (2004), this could establish jurisdiction at the base.
* The court had concern that there is a gray area where certain types of cases would fall through the cracks, because only the U.S. military appeared to have jurisdiction. On the other hand, Justice Scalia noted, it may be possible, and better, for Congress to remedy that situation, as they have deliberative powers the court does not.

==== Quotes ====
Justice Scalia regarding the purpose of jurisdiction: The Constitution requires jurisdiction—the Constitution requires that an American citizen who has the protection of the Constitution have some manner of vindicating his rights under the Constitution.

Justice Breyer on whether to deny jurisdiction to citizens outside the U.S. So what I&#x27;m thinking now, assuming that it&#x27;s very hard to interpret Eisentrager, is that if we go with you, it has a virtue of clarity. There is a clear rule. Not a citizen outside the United States; you don&#x27;t get your foot in the door. But against you is that same fact. It seems rather contrary to an idea of a constitution with three branches that the executive would be free to do whatever they want, whatever they want without a check.

Justice Scalia on whether the courts or Congress are better suited to rewrite laws:
Can we hold hearings to determine the problems that are bothering you? I mean, we have to take your word for what the problems are. We can&#x27;t call witnesses and see what the real problems are, can we, in creating this new, substantive rule that we&#x27;re going to let the courts create? Congress could do all that, though, couldn&#x27;t it? ...
If it wanted to change the habeas statute, it could make all sorts of refined modifications about issues that we know nothing whatever about because we have only lawyers before us, we have no witnesses, we have no cross-examination, we have no investigative staff. And we should be the ones, Justice Breyer suggests, to draw up this reticulated system to preserve our military from intervention by the courts.

===Opinion of the Court===
On June 28, 2004, the Supreme Court of the United States decided against the Government. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer, held that the detainees had a statutory right to petition federal courts for habeas review.

That same day, the Supreme Court ruled against the Government in &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;. Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor wrote the four justice plurality opinion finding that an American citizen detained in Guantanamo had a constitutional right to petition federal courts for habeas review under the Due Process Clause.

Quoting Lord Mansfield and William Blackstone, Justice Stevens reasoned that common law courts exercise habeas jurisdiction over all dominions under the sovereign&#x27;s control.

===Justice Kennedy&#x27;s concurrence in judgment===
Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred only in the judgment. While refusing to join the majority&#x27;s opinion&#x27;s view of &quot;automatic statutory authority&quot;, Justice Kennedy felt federal-court jurisdiction is permitted, &quot;in light of the status of Guantanamo Bay and the indefinite pretrial detention of detainees&quot;.

===Justice Scalia&#x27;s dissent===
Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justice Clarence Thomas, filed a dissenting opinion. Attacking the majority&#x27;s statutory interpretation Justice Scalia wrote, &quot;for this Court to create such a monstrous scheme in time of war, and in frustration of our military commanders&#x27; reliance upon clearly stated prior law, is judicial adventurism of the worst sort.&quot;

==Subsequent developments==
The United States Government announced that it planned to charge Hicks and Habib before a military commission. Habib was released in January 2005, after the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported his abduction from Pakistan to Egypt by the CIA soon after his arrest. He was held and tortured in Egypt for five months before being returned to Pakistan, and then transferred to military custody and Guantanamo Bay.

===Justice Rutledge&#x27;s influence===
Directly after law school, John Paul Stevens worked as a law clerk to Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge. In &quot;Ahrens v. Clark&quot; (1948), the Court held that no federal court had been given territorial jurisdiction over Ellis Island, provoking Justice Rutledge to file a dissent Stevens helped draft.

In 1956, Stevens wrote a book chapter where he quoted Justice Rutledge&#x27;s dissent from &quot;In re Tomoyuki Yamashita&quot; (1946): &quot;It is not too early, it is never too early, for the nation to steadfastly follow its great constitutional traditions, none older or more universally protective against unbridled power than due process of law in the trial and punishment of men, this is, of all men, whether citizens, aliens, alien enemies or enemy belligerents. It can become too late.&quot;

Justice Stevens quoted the &quot;Ahrens&quot; dissent approvingly in &quot;Rasul&quot;, fifty-six years after he had drafted it as a clerk.

===&quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; (2006)===
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz responded by creating &quot;Combatant Status Review Tribunals&quot; to determine if detainees were unlawful combatants. Detainee&#x27;s habeas petitions to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia were consolidated into two cases. In one, Judge Richard J. Leon rejected the detainees petition because they &quot;have no cognizable Constitutional rights&quot; on January 19, 2005. In the other, Judge Joyce Hens Green granted the detainees petition, finding the CSRTs were insufficient to protect the detainees rights under the Geneva Convention and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution on January 31, 2005.

On July 15, 2005, a panel of the D.C. Circuit made of Judge A. Raymond Randolph then-Circuit Judge John Roberts and Judge Stephen F. Williams vacated the lower rulings and threw out the detainees&#x27; petitions. On November 7, 2005, the Supreme Court agreed to review that judgment. On December 30, 2005, Congress responded by passing the Detainee Treatment Act, which changed the statute to explicitly strip detainees of any right to petition courts for habeas review.

On June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court decided against the Government in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;. Justice Stevens, writing for a five justice majority, found that courts had jurisdiction to hear those detainees&#x27; petitions which had been filed before Congress enacted the DTA and that the CSRTs violated the Geneva Conventions standards enacted in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

===&quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; (2008)===
Congress responded by passing the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which gave statutory authorization to the CSRTs and was explicit in retroactively stripping detainees of any right to petition courts for habeas review. On February 20, 2007, D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, joined by Judge David B. Sentelle upheld the Act and dismissed the detainees&#x27; petitions, over the dissent of Judge Judith W. Rogers.

On June 12, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court decided against the Government in &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot;. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five justice majority, held that the detainees had a right to petition federal courts for writs of habeas corpus under the United States Constitution. Justice Antonin Scalia strongly dissented, writing that the Court&#x27;s decision, &quot;will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed&quot;.

<doc id="642928" wikidata="Q6529849" url="?curid=642928" title="Les Paul and Mary Ford">
<text>[[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]] were a popular 1950s husband-and-wife musical duo who performed and recorded during 1945–1963. They both sang and played guitars.

Ford and Paul were music superstars during the first half of the 1950s, putting out 28 hits for Capitol Records between 1950 and 1957, including &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot; (11 weeks at No. 1), &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill&quot; (top 10), &quot;How High the Moon&quot; (nine weeks at No. 1), &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot; and &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot;.

==Background==
The couple were introduced to each other by Gene Autry in 1945 and were married on December 29, 1949. They first appeared in the pop charts in 1950. Between the years 1950 and 1954, Les Paul and Mary Ford had 16 top-ten hits. They had five top-ten hits within nine months. &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;, &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill&quot;, &quot;How High the Moon&quot; (#1 for nine weeks), &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Whispering&quot;. From August 1952 to March 1953 they had five more top-ten hits; &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Lady of Spain&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Sitting on Top of the World&quot; and &quot;Vaya Con Dios&quot; (#1 for 11 weeks). Their 1954 version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Fool to Care&quot; went to No. 6, and was featured in a memorable Southern Comfort commercial in 2013 that got over 1 million views on YouTube.

In 2009, they were inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.

Paul and Ford are famous for creating a makeshift recording studio in their garage. In their garage studio, they used multitrack recording to record many of their hits including ‘Lover’, ‘Nola’, ‘Brazil’ and ‘Whispering&#x27; with only the two of them.

Paul and Ford divorced acrimoniously in December 1964, which also ended the collaboration between the two.

The duo have a star at 1541 Vine Street in the Recording section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Radio and television programs==
Paul had hosted a 15-minute radio program, &quot;The Les Paul Show&quot;, on NBC in 1950, featuring his trio (himself, Ford, and rhythm player Eddie Stapleton) and his electronics, recorded from their home and with gentle humour between Paul and Ford bridging musical selections, some of which had already been successful on records, some of which anticipated the couple&#x27;s recordings, and many of which presented dazzling re-interpretations of such jazz and pop selections as &quot;In the Mood,&quot; &quot;Little Rock Getaway,&quot; &quot;Brazil,&quot; and &quot;Tiger Rag.&quot; Several recordings of these shows survive among old-time radio collectors today.

The show also appeared on television a few years later with the same format, but excluding the trio and retitled &quot;The Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford Show&quot; (aka &quot;Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford At Home&quot;) with &quot;Vaya Con Dios&quot; as a theme song. Sponsored by Warner–Lambert&#x27;s Listerine, it was widely syndicated during 1954—55 and was only five minutes long (one or two songs) on film and therefore used as a brief interlude or fill-in on programming schedules. Since Les created the entire show himself, including audio and video, he maintained the original recordings and was in the process of restoring them to up-to-date quality at the time of his death.

<text>The Saint Elias Mountains () are a subgroup of the Pacific Coast Ranges, located in southeastern Alaska in the United States, Southwestern Yukon and the very far northwestern part of British Columbia in Canada. The range spans Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve in the United States and Kluane National Park and Reserve in Canada and includes all of Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. In Alaska, the range includes parts of the city/borough of Yakutat and the Hoonah-Angoon and Valdez-Cordova census areas.

This mountain range is named after Mount Saint Elias, which in turn was named in 1741 by the Danish-born Russian explorer Vitus Bering.

==Geology==
The Saint Elias Mountains form the highest coastal mountain range on Earth. It formed due to the subduction of the Yakutat microplate underneath the North American Plate. The Yakutat microplate is a wedge shaped oceanic plateau with a thickness of . Similar to the adjacent Pacific Plate, which has a crustal thickness of , the Yakutat plate is moving northwestward at a rate of per year with respect to North America. The Yakutat plate is transported northwards along the active Fairweather Fault, which probably started more than 35 million years ago. Due to its thickness, the Yakutat plate is buoyant, resulting in surface uplift of the overriding North American plate, which formed the Talkeetna Mountains and the Alaska Range in Southcentral Alaska, located above the subducted part of the Yakutat plate.
The Saint Elias Mountains formed at the plate boundary between the Yakutat and North American plates. The up-to--thick sediments that have been deposited on top of the Yakutat plate became imbricated and deformed as they were scraped off and compose today the southern (coastal) flanks of the St. Elias Mountains. In contrast the high elevated regions of the drainage divide (Bagley Icefield, Seward Glacier) and north of it are composed of rocks that are part of the North American plate.
The highest peaks of the St. Elias Mountains are located in the high ice field region of the Kluane National Park (Mount Logan, Mount Vancouver) and north of the Malaspina Glacier (Mount Saint Elias, Mount Cook), in the region known as the St. Elias syntaxis. At the syntaxis region the tectonic style changes from strike-slip motion along the Fairweather Fault to collision west of Malaspina Strait. This tectonic transition concentrates stress in the crust at the syntaxis that together with efficient glacial erosion results in positive feedback processes that through time forms extreme high mountain peaks and local relief, and rapid exhumation of rocks from up to depths to the surface.

== Ranges ==
The mountains are divided by the Duke Depression, with the shorter, more rounded Kluane Ranges to the east, and the higher Icefield Ranges to the west. Sub-ranges of the Saint Elias include the Alsek Ranges, the Fairweather Range, and the Centennial Range.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Addison Earl Baker (January 1, 1907 – August 1, 1943) was commander of the 93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) in the U.S. Army Air Forces who led the group on the low-altitude Allied bombing mission of oil refineries at Ploieşti, Romania, Operation Tidal Wave. For his actions during World War II he received the United States of America&#x27;s highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor (posthumously).

Baker joined the Army Air Corps from Akron, Ohio in 1929, and earned his wings and a commission in 1931.

==Early military service==

Baker enlisted in the Army Air Corps on January 17, 1929, and graduated from the Air Corps Training Center on February 28, 1931. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps on February 27, 1931. On July 6, 1934, he was commissioned in the Michigan National Guard, serving until October 5, 1935. He later transferred to the Ohio National Guard, and was commissioned in the 112th Observation Squadron on April 15, 1936. He was inducted into federal service on 25 November 1940. In early 1942, he was reassigned to the newly-activated 93rd Bombardment Group.

==Final mission==
On August 1, 1943, the 93rd Bombardment Group, one of three group from the Eighth Air Force sent to the Ninth Air Force especially for this mission, took to the air at Benghazi, Libya. Piloting &quot;Hell&#x27;s Wench&quot;, a B-24 Liberator (Serial 42-40994), Baker led the 93rd as the second formation in the five-group mission of 177 aircraft. Co-piloting the aircraft was a volunteer and former member of the 93d, Major John L. Jerstad.

En route the aircraft carrying the mission navigator crashed at sea. As a result, when the force reached the target area, the lead group turned at the wrong point and flew towards Bucharest. Baker attempted to warn the mission commander of this error, but when that failed, led the remainder of the force to the correct turning point.

Although &quot;Hell&#x27;s Wench&quot; had been seriously damaged by German anti-aircraft guns and was on fire, Baker maintained formation and bombed his target. Subsequently, Baker broke formation to avoid a mid-air collision with bombers from the lead group, now arriving in the target area from the opposite direction. He attempted to gain altitude so that his crew could escape from the doomed aircraft by parachute, but despite his efforts, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Wench&quot; crashed and exploded, killing Baker and the other nine airmen aboard.

His body was initially not identified after being recovered by the Romanians, and he was buried as an unknown American in the Hero Section of the Civilian and Military Cemetery at Ploieşti. After the war, the American Graves Registration Committee attempted to identify as many of the unknowns from the Ploieşti mission as possible, but Baker&#x27;s remains were among those that were still unidentifiable with the forensics technology of the 1940s. He was memorialized on the Tablets of the Missing at the Florence American Cemetery and Memorial, in Florence, Italy. On April 13, 2022, the U.S. government&#x27;s Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that Baker&#x27;s remains had been identified on April 8, 2022 using modern forensics techniques. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Tablets of the Missing to denote that he has been accounted for. Baker was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery on September 14, 2022.

==Honors==
On March 11, 1944, Baker was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Major Jerstad also received the Medal of Honor, on October 28, 1943, for his role on the mission.


===Medal of Honor citation===
Rank and organization: Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army Air Corps, 93d Heavy Bombardment Group. Place and date: Ploesti Raid, Rumania, August 1, 1943. Entered service at: Akron, Ohio. Born: January 1, 1907, Chicago, Ill. G.O. No.: 20, March 11, 1944.

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy on August 1, 1943. On this date he led his command, the 93d Heavy Bombardment Group, on a daring low-level attack against enemy oil refineries and installations at Ploesti, Rumania. Approaching the target, his aircraft was hit by a large caliber antiaircraft shell, seriously damaged and set on fire. Ignoring the fact he was flying over terrain suitable for safe landing, he refused to jeopardize the mission by breaking up the lead formation and continued unswervingly to lead his group to the target upon which he dropped his bombs with devastating effect. Only then did he leave formation, but his valiant attempts to gain sufficient altitude for the crew to escape by parachute were unavailing and his aircraft crashed in flames after his successful efforts to avoid other planes in formation. By extraordinary flying skill, gallant leadership and intrepidity, Lt. Col. Baker rendered outstanding, distinguished, and valorous service to our Nation.

<doc id="642936" wikidata="Q1076175" url="?curid=642936" title="Immersion lithography">
<text>Immersion lithography is a technique used in semiconductor manufacturing to enhance the resolution and accuracy of the lithographic process. It involves using a liquid medium, typically water, between the lens and the wafer during exposure. By using a liquid with a higher refractive index than air, immersion lithography allows for smaller features to be created on the wafer.

Immersion lithography replaces the usual air gap between the final lens and the wafer surface with a liquid medium that has a refractive index greater than one. The angular resolution is increased by a factor equal to the refractive index of the liquid. Current immersion lithography tools use highly purified water for this liquid, achieving feature sizes below 45 nanometers.

==Background==
The ability to resolve features in optical lithography is directly related to the numerical aperture of the imaging equipment, the numerical aperture being the sine of the maximum refraction angle multiplied by the refractive index of the medium through which the light travels. The lenses in the highest resolution &quot;dry&quot; photolithography scanners focus light in a cone whose boundary is nearly parallel to the wafer surface. As it is impossible to increase resolution by further refraction, additional resolution is obtained by inserting an immersion medium with a higher index of refraction between the lens and the wafer. The blurriness is reduced by a factor equal to the refractive index of the medium. For example, for water immersion using ultraviolet light at 193 nm wavelength, the index of refraction is 1.44.

The resolution enhancement from immersion lithography is about 30–40% depending on materials used. However, the depth of focus, or tolerance in wafer topography flatness, is improved compared to the corresponding &quot;dry&quot; tool at the same resolution.

The idea for immersion lithography was patented in 1984 by Takanashi et al. It was also proposed by Taiwanese engineer Burn J. Lin and realized in the 1980s. In 2004, IBM&#x27;s director of silicon technology, Ghavam Shahidi, announced that IBM planned to commercialize lithography based on light filtered through water.

==Defects==
Defect concerns, e.g., water left behind (watermarks) and loss of resist-water adhesion (air gap or bubbles), have led to considerations of using a topcoat layer directly on top of the photoresist. This topcoat would serve as a barrier for chemical diffusion between the liquid medium and the photoresist. In addition, the interface between the liquid and the topcoat would be optimized for watermark reduction. At the same time, defects from topcoat use should be avoided.

As of 2005, Topcoats had been tuned for use as antireflection coatings, especially for hyper-NA (NA&gt;1) cases.

By 2008, defect counts on wafers printed by immersion lithography had reached zero level capability.

==Polarization impacts==
As of 2000, Polarization effects due to high angles of interference in the photoresist were considered as features approach 40 nm. Hence, illumination sources generally need to be azimuthally polarized to match the pole illumination for ideal line-space imaging.

==Throughput==
As of 1996, this was achieved through higher stage speeds, which in turn, as of 2013 were allowed by higher power ArF laser pulse sources. Specifically, the throughput is directly proportional to stage speed V, which is related to dose D and rectangular slit width S and slit intensity Iss (which is directly related to pulse power) by V=Iss*S/D. The slit height is the same as the field height. The slit width S, in turn, is limited by the number of pulses to make the dose (n), divided by the frequency of the laser pulses (f), at the maximum scan speed Vmax by S=Vmax*n/f. At a fixed frequency f and pulse number n, the slit width will be proportional to the maximum stage speed. Hence, throughput at a given dose is improved by increasing maximum stage speed as well as increasing pulse power.

According to ASML s product information about twinscan-nxt1980di, immersion lithography tools currently boasted the highest throughputs (275 WPH) as targeted for high volume manufacturing.

==Multiple patterning==


The resolution limit for a 1.35 NA immersion tool operating at 193 nm wavelength is 36 nm. Going beyond this limit to sub-20nm nodes requires multiple patterning. At the 20nm foundry and memory nodes and beyond, double patterning and triple patterning are already being used with immersion lithography for the densest layers.

<text>The Awarau River, also known as Larry&#x27;s Creek is located within the South Island of New Zealand. The river is about long and runs northwest from its headwaters in the Victoria Range to its confluence with the Inangahua River north of Reefton. It also drains part of the Brunner Range and there was a track along that range linking to Lyell by 1901, though none existed in 1874. A track also ran south over Kirwan Hill to the Montgomerie River.

A forestry road runs north of the river from SH69 to Larrys Creek Track, which runs a further to the site of the Caledonian Gold Mine. The mine operated from 1874 to 1910, with shafts up to deep. It is the most northerly in the Reefton goldfield, in albite-epidote hornfels facies, which are less than 370 million years old. Remnants of a stamping battery and a Robey portable steam engine are at the mine site. Colinton was formed in 1874 as the township for the mine (and the river was sometimes called Colin River). By 1878 it had a population of 44, but was gone by 1901. Just upstream is a deep, rocky gorge.

The only bridges over the river are the Stillwater–Ngākawau railway and SH69. Railway bridge 74 was a road-rail bridge of 7 spans, built in 1905 for £2,915. A bridge was planned at Colinton in 1880, but never built.

Nothofagus fusca (red beech, or tawhai raunui) forests grow to about the contour, with Nothofagus menziesii (silver beech, tawhai, or tahina) up to the tree line at about . Tūī, Anthornis melanura (korimako, makomako, kōmako, or bellbird), Petroica macrocephala (ngirungiru, or tomtit) and Petroica australis (Kakaruwai, or South Island robin) live in the bush.

<text>The Don Valley Brick Works (often referred to as the Evergreen Brick Works) is a former quarry and industrial site located in the Don River Valley in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Don Valley Brick Works operated for nearly 100 years and provided bricks used to construct many well-known Toronto landmarks, such as Casa Loma, Osgoode Hall, Massey Hall, and the Ontario Legislature. Since the closure of the original factory, the quarry has been converted into a city park which includes a series of naturalized ponds, while the buildings have been restored and opened as an environmentally focused community and cultural centre by Evergreen, a national charity dedicated to restoring nature in urban environments.

== History ==
The Don Valley Brick Works was created in 1889 by the Taylor brothers. John Taylor and his brothers, William and George, had purchased the site in the Don Valley in the 1830s where they established a paper mill. While digging post holes to make a fence, William came across some good quality clay. He took a sample to a local brick works where it was confirmed that it would make a high quality brick. A quarry was soon established at the north end of the site and a brick making plant was built at the south end of the property near the Don River.
The &quot;Don Valley Pressed Brick Company&quot; produced bricks using three techniques. The first was called a soft-mud process. Clay quarried from the site was mixed with water from nearby Mud Creek, placed in moulds which were dried and then baked in kilns. A second technique called dry-press bricks used quarried shale. The shale was placed into moulds and machine pressed. A third process called stiff-mud used a mixture of clay and shale that used less water than the soft-mud process. A column of clay was forced through a die which was then cut to form using a wire. Finished product was shipped by cart out of the valley along Pottery Road or by rail on a spur built into the yard. Bricks were used mostly in Toronto but were used across the continent. The bricks made were of such good quality that they won prizes at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893 and the Toronto Industrial Fair in 1894.

In 1893, the company added a continuous down-draft kiln which increased the quality and amount of bricks produced. By 1907 the company had two of these kilns in operation and was producing between 85,000 and 100,000 bricks per day. After a 1904 major fire destroyed much of downtown Toronto, the Brick Works supplied the brick for much of the ensuing construction.

In 1909, the Taylors sold the company to Robert Davies (a brother-in-law married to sister Margaret Anne Taylor). Davies changed the name to the &quot;Don Valley Brick Company Limited&quot;. In the 1920s a major expansion resulted in a name change to the &quot;Don Valley Brick Works Limited&quot;. Electricity was added and a new sand-lime plant was added that created a less expensive brick used for interior construction. In 1928, the company was sold to Strathgowan Investments and was renamed again to the &quot;Toronto Brick Company&quot;. At this time the company had reached peak production of about 25 million bricks per year. During the Great Depression, the area to the south of the Brick Works became a large encampment of indigent men from around Canada. They built shanties and were assisted by Toronto residents. During the winters, the men would sleep inside the Brick Works kilns. The company also operated a brick making facility in Birch Cliff from 1913 to 1963 on what was once a sand and gravel quarry. John Price Limited, a smaller brickmaker in east end Toronto on Greenwood Avenue was acquired then merged into the Toronto Brick Company and ceased operating in 1935.
During World War II, production was reduced. The plant used German prisoners of war that were housed at nearby Todmorden Mills. After the war a building boom revived demand. However, the sand-lime plant was destroyed by fire in 1946. Also the plant consolidated its outbuildings and three of the four signature chimneys were knocked down. Only one chimney remains today. The site underwent many changes during its existence, adding and removing buildings whenever and wherever it was conducive to the brick making process. The buildings, cluttered on the south end of the site, are all rectilinear buildings arranged in a grid-like pattern, connected wherever the users saw a need.

In 1956, United Ceramics Limited of Germany acquired the Brick Works. Over the next 25 years a new sand-lime plant was constructed. Also a Parkhill Martin Brick machine was moved from a nearby brick works to this site. It produced soft-mud bricks for the antique market. By the 1980s most of the usable clay and shale had been quarried. The company decided to offer the land to the city for $4 million CAD for conservation purposes. However, a company called Torvalley Associates offered $4,001,000 for the site and purchased the site. East York Council allowed the site to be re-zoned for a housing development.

The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority had final say on the matter since the site was partially on the floodplain of the valley. They expropriated the land in 1987 but were forced to pay approximately $14,000,000 since the land was zoned as residential. Another company, Brampton Brick leased the site and purchased the remaining equipment. They operated a retail outlet at the site until 1991.
 The fill in of the quarry began in the late 1940s. It was used as a city dump for years.
In 1994, restoration of the site began. The quarry was filled in using material from the excavation of the Scotia Plaza tower in downtown Toronto. Once filled, the site was landscaped to create a series of three ponds using water diverted from Mud Creek. The water flows out of the ponds into a channel that was used to divert water into the brick plant. The channel then flows underneath Bayview Avenue and back into the Don River. The remaining area was turned into meadow. The shores of the ponds were planted with native trees, shrubs and wildflowers. The site was officially opened in 1997 and christened the &quot;Weston Family Quarry Garden&quot;. The Beltline Trail, along the path of the old Toronto Belt Line Railway, passes by the Brick Works.

Since then, the site has attracted many species of birds and animals. Although no fish were stocked in the ponds, fish have migrated into the ponds from the Don River. The ponds have also become a dumping ground for goldfish and red-eared slider turtles that have outgrown their home terrariums.

== Weston Family Quarry Garden ==

The park section of the Brick Works, managed by the City of Toronto, includes a series of three ponds, a large meadow and a small forest. The ponds are fed by a diversion pipe running from Mud Creek which flows just to the west of the Brick Works. Initially, the area adjacent to the ponds was planted with species native to Ontario. This also included some species that are not locally native including tulip tree, fragrant sumac and eastern redbud. These Carolinian species, typically found farther south, are at the northern limit of their range in Toronto.

Once the wetlands became established, many species of birds have visited to forage or breed. Mammals, reptiles (including Midland painted turtle and snapping turtle), amphibians, and some fish have also found their way to the Brick Works and have established themselves. This includes ducks, Canada geese, toads, muskrats, sparrows, and others.

The Brick Works wetland is connected to a number of other nature reserve areas via forest trail, and is part of a larger effort to reestablish the Don Valley watershed.

The north quarry wall was the site of a number of important geological discoveries which provided information on the glacial history of southern Ontario. This area, referred to as the Toronto Brickyard, was designated as an earth science Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in 2009 for exhibiting &quot;Ordovician Georgian Bay Formation, Illinoian Glacial York Till, Sangamonian Interglacial Don Formation and Wisconsian Glacial Scarborough delta, Pottery Road sediments and Sunnybrook Till all overlain by North Bay Interstadial, Lake Iroquois sands.&quot;

== Future of the Brick Works ==
Evergreen, a Canadian non-profit organization whose activities have included stewardship of the Don Valley Brick Works buildings site since 2008, has transformed the abandoned buildings into a cultural centre with a focus on the environment. Having leased the &quot;industrial pad&quot; portion of the site from the Toronto Region and Conservation Authority, Evergreen has renovated several of the existing structures and constructed one new building known as the Centre for Green Cities. The goal of the revitalization is adaptive reuse, where most of the buildings will be reinforced where needed and repurposed to house the new programming planned for the site. In this way, the site can be recycled as much as possible and the historical integrity of the Don Valley Brick Works can be maintained.

Evergreen Brick Works will be an education centre addressing the themes of nature, culture and community. [...] [I]t will be a destination for families and individuals to enjoy a natural refuge, while sampling a rich offering of programs and services - from gardening workshops, heritage tours, and clay-making and organic food markets, to a retail nursery, demonstration gardens and leading-edge green design techniques.

$20 million of the project&#x27;s $55-million dollar budget was pledged by the federal government under the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund, and the Province of Ontario contributed an additional $10 million. The construction process began in November 2008, and grand opening of Evergreen Brick Works took place September 28, 2010. The complex is now open to the public, with regular shuttle bus service running daily from Broadview Subway Station. Public transit is also available from Davisville subway station by bus route 28 Bayview South.

Design and construction was a joint venture between Du Toit Allsopp Hiller Architects, Diamond Schmitt Architects, and several other prominent firms. DTAH is responsible for the master planning, while Diamond Schmitt are the designers of the new building, which includes the Young Welcome Centre. Other programming for the site includes art exhibits, children&#x27;s programming, garden centre, and office space for Evergreen and other environmental organizations.

Restoration to the building include structural reinforcement, and replacement of material such as the current asbestos transite roofing in favour of a more effective, longer lasting material. Several of the buildings were left without roof cladding in order to create open air spaces, leaving the steel trusses visible. The building&#x27;s red-brick masonry was preserved as much as possible, while interiors were renovated to update plumbing, life safety and mechanical systems, as outlined in Evergreen&#x27;s Master Plan Update 2007. Each building has programming set aside for it in DTAH&#x27;s planning scheme, such that the project can continue to expand as funds become available.

In 2009, &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; named Evergreen Brick Works one of the 10 finalists in its Geotourism Challenge 2009, &quot;a global competition of tourism-related projects that promote natural and cultural heritage while improving the well-being of the local people&quot;. The 10 finalists were chosen from 610 entries from 81 countries.

Since 2010 the Evergreen Brick Works has been home to the private school Gradale Academy. Outward Bound Canada has operated out of the location since 2011.

===July 2024 flood event ===
In 2024, during a major flooding event in southern Ontario, Evergreen Brick Works experienced severe flood damage. While it was built to mitigate weather-related risk, using 20,000 litre rain barrels, permeable materials, and green spaces designed to support stormwater absorption, the site is located on a flood plain and was not able to withstand the extent of the flooding. Owners of on-site eatery the Picnic Café estimated the cost of repairs of the café alone at $200,000 to $300,000.

As of 26 July 2024, the non-profit that operates Evergreen Brick Works was continuing to raise money to support repairs.

<text>The Banu Isam were a Berber Muslim dynasty that ruled Ceuta, present-day Spain, for four generations. The town had been destroyed in a rebellion, and was lying waste; sometime in the middle of the 9th century, Mâjakas, chief of the Berber Majkasa tribe, resettled it and founded a dynasty that ruled the town until the Umayyads took it over in 931.

Its kings were:
*Mâjakas
*`Isâm, son of Mâjakas
*Majîr, son of `Isâm
*Ridâ, son of `Isâm (?-931), who paid allegiance to the Idrisids, but surrendered the city to the Umayyads when the Idrisid capital fell.

<doc id="642965" wikidata="Q1687299" url="?curid=642965" title="William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey">
<text>William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, Lord of Lewes, Seigneur de Varennes (died 1088), was a Norman nobleman created Earl of Surrey under William II Rufus. He is among the few known from documents to have fought under William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. At the time of Domesday Book in 1086 he held extensive lands in 13 counties, including the Rape of Lewes, a tract now divided between the ceremonial counties of East Sussex and West Sussex.

==Early career==
William was a son of Rodulf or Ralph de Warenne and Emma and reported to have descended from a sibling of Duchess Gunnor, wife of Duke Richard I. Chronicler Robert of Torigni reported, in his additions to the &quot;Gesta Normannorum Ducum&quot; of William of Jumièges, that William de Warenne and Anglo-Norman baron Roger de Mortimer were both sons of an unnamed niece of Gunnor. Unfortunately Robert&#x27;s genealogies are somewhat confused – elsewhere he gives Roger as the son of William and yet again makes both sons of Walter de Saint Martin – while several of Robert&#x27;s stemmata seem to contain too few generations. Orderic Vitalis describes William as Roger&#x27;s &quot;consanguineus&quot; – literally a cousin, more generally a term of close kinship not typically used to describe brothers – and Roger de Mortimer appears to have been a generation older than him.

Charters report several earlier men associated with Warenne. A Radulf de Warenne appears in two charters, one dating between 1027 and 1035, the other from about 1050 and naming his wife, Beatrice. In 1059, a Radulf and wife Emma appear along with their sons Radulf and William. These occurrences have typically been taken to represent a single Radulf with successive wives, of which Beatrice was the mother of William and hence identical to the Gunnorid niece described by Robert de Torigny, yet the 1059 charter explicitly names Emma as William&#x27;s mother. 

Re-evaluation of surviving charters led Katherine Keats-Rohan to suggest that Robert of Torigni compressed two generations into one, as he appears to have done elsewhere, with Radulf (I) and Beatrice being parents of Radulf (II) de Warenne and of Roger de Mortimer – a Roger son of Radulf de Warenne appears in a charter dated 1040/1053 – while Radulf (II) in turn married Emma, and as attested by the 1059 charter, they had as sons Radulf (III) as the heir in Normandy, and William. Associations with the village of Vascœuil led to identification of the Warenne progenitrix with a widow Beatrice, daughter of Tesselin, Viscount of Rouen, who appeared there in 1054–1060. Robert of Torigni shows a different Viscount of Rouen to have married a niece of Gunnor, perhaps suggesting that it was through Beatrice that William de Warenne was linked with Gunnor&#x27;s family. 

William was from the hamlet of Varenne, near Arques-la-Bataille, Duchy of Normandy, now in the canton of Bellencombre, Seine Maritime. 

At the beginning of Duke William&#x27;s reign Radulf de Warenne was not a major landholder, whilst William de Warenne as a second son did not stand to inherit the family&#x27;s small estates. During the rebellions of 1052–1054 the young William de Warenne proved himself loyal to the Duke and played a strong part in the Battle of Mortemer, for which he was rewarded with lands confiscated from his kinsman, Roger of Mortemer, including the Castle of Mortimer and most of its lands. 

At about the same time he acquired lands at Bellencombre including the castle that became the centre of William de Warenne&#x27;s holdings in Normandy.

==Conquest of England==
William was among the Norman barons summoned to the Council of Lillebonne by Duke William when the decision was made to oppose King Harold II&#x27;s accession to the throne of England. He fought at Hastings and was rewarded with numerous holdings. Domesday records his lands stretching over 13 counties, including the important Rape of Lewes in Sussex, several manors in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, the major manor of Conisbrough in Yorkshire and Castle Acre in Norfolk, which became his headquarters or caput. 

He is one of few proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He fought against rebels at the Isle of Ely in 1071, where he showed a special desire to hunt down Hereward the Wake, who had killed his brother-in-law Frederick the year before. 

Hereward is supposed to have unhorsed him with an arrow shot.

==Later career==
Sometime between 1078 and 1082 William and his wife Gundred travelled to Rome, visiting monasteries on the way. In Burgundy they were halted by a war between Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. They visited Cluny Abbey in France and were so impressed by the monks and their dedication that they decided to found a Cluniac priory on their own lands in England, for which William restored buildings for an abbey. They sent to Hugh, Abbot of Cluny, to staff their monastery. At first Hugh was reluctant, but he finally sent several monks, including Lazlo, who was to be the first Abbot. The house founded was Lewes Priory, dedicated to St Pancras, which was England&#x27;s first Cluniac priory.

William supported the King in the siege of Saint-Suzanne against some rebellious lords. His loyalty to William II led to his creation as Earl of Surrey, probably in early 1088. In the Rebellion of 1088 he was mortally wounded at the First Siege of Pevensey Castle, and died on 24 June 1088 at Lewes, now in East Sussex. He was buried beside his wife, Gundred, in the chapter house of Lewes Priory which he had founded.

==Family==
William de Warenne married first, before 1070, Gundred, Countess of Surrey, sister of Gerbod the Fleming, 1st Earl of Chester.

William married secondly a sister of Richard Gouet, who survived him.

===Issue===
By Gundred, William had:
*William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (died 1138), who married Elisabeth (Isabelle) de Vermandois, widow of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester
*Edith de Warenne, who married first Gerard de Gournay, lord of Gournay-en-Bray, and then Drew de Monchy
*Reynold de Warenne, who inherited lands from his mother in Flanders and died c. 1106–1108
*A daughter of unknown name, who married Ernise de Coulonces.

He had no issue by his second wife.

<text>Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim (; 13 October 1771 – 18 October 1853) was a Saxon anatomist, entomologist and paleontologist.

Fischer was born as Gotthilf Fischer in Waldheim, Saxony, the son of a linen weaver. He studied medicine at Leipzig. He travelled to Vienna and Paris with his friend Alexander von Humboldt and studied under Georges Cuvier. He took up a professorship at Mainz, and then in 1804, became Professor of Natural History and Director of the Demidov Natural History Museum at the Moscow University. In August 1805, he founded the Société Impériale des Naturalistes de Moscou. Fischer was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1812 and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1818.

Fischer was mainly engaged in the classification of invertebrates, the result of which was his &quot;Entomographia Imperii Rossici&quot; (1820–1851). He also spent time studying fossils from the area around Moscow.

Due to his work studying the insects of Russia, the Russian government granted him nobility as well as the &quot;von Waldheim&quot; ending to his name.

<doc id="642973" wikidata="Q1192023" url="?curid=642973" title="Project Steve">
<text>Project Steve is a list of scientists with the given name Stephen or Steven or a variation thereof (e.g., Stephanie, Stefan, Esteban, etc.) who &quot;support evolution&quot;. It was originally created by the National Center for Science Education as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek parody&quot; of creationist attempts to collect a list of scientists who &quot;doubt evolution&quot;, such as the Answers in Genesis&#x27;s list of scientists who accept the biblical account of the Genesis creation narrative or the Discovery Institute&#x27;s &quot;A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism&quot;. The list pokes fun at such endeavors while making it clear that, &quot;We did not wish to mislead the public into thinking that scientific issues are decided by who has the longer list of scientists!&quot; It also honors Stephen Jay Gould. The level of support for evolution among scientists is very high. A 2009 poll by Pew Research Center found that &quot;[n]early all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time.&quot;

However, at the same time the project is a genuine collection of scientists. Despite the list&#x27;s restriction to only scientists with names like &quot;Steve&quot;, which it turns out is roughly 1 percent of scientists, Project Steve is longer and contains many more eminent scientists than any creationist list. In particular, &quot;Project Steve&quot; contains many more biologists than the creationist lists, with about 54% of the listed Steves being biologists. The &quot;List of Steves&quot; webpage provides an updated total of scientist &quot;Steves&quot; who have signed the list. , Project Steve has 1,498 signatories.

== Statement ==
The statement that signatories agree to reads:

There have been some complaints that the statement left out the geological sciences, where evolution is an important principle as well. However, this oversight was noticed too late and it was decided that it would be more effort than it is worth to go back to correct it.

== History ==
The project was named in honor of the paleontologist and essayist Stephen Jay Gould (1941–2002). It began in 2003, with an official press release on February 16, 2003. The press release was issued at the American Association for the Advancement of Science&#x27;s 2003 convention in Denver, Colorado, after a lecture by Lawrence Krauss titled &quot;Scientific Ignorance as a Way of Life: From Science Fiction in Washington to Intelligent Design in the Classroom.&quot; Krauss made the actual announcement and directed the reporters to NCSE Director Eugenie Scott, who was sitting in the audience in the front row.

The original goal was to collect the signatures of 100 Steves, but this goal was reached in about 10 days. Both Nobel Prize-winning Steves in science — Steven Weinberg and Steven Chu (who has since served as Secretary of Energy in Barack Obama&#x27;s Cabinet) — were among the first 100 Steves. Over 200 Steves responded in the first month. As the news of Project Steve spread by word of mouth, ever-increasing numbers of Steves contacted the NCSE, and the list continued to grow.

Project Steve captured the attention of the media. The first media coverage included articles in the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; and an interview of NCSE director Eugenie Scott by Australian science journalist and radio broadcaster Robyn Williams for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s radio show, &quot;The Science Show&quot;. &quot;The Science Show&quot; arranged for Geoff Sirmai and David Fisher of the Australian musical comedy team &quot;Comic Roasts&quot; to write the &quot;Steve Song&quot;, a parody of the Monty Python song about Spam, for Project Steve. The song had its debut on &quot;The Science Show&quot; episode featuring the interview of Scott which aired on Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National on March 8, 2003.

Cambridge University Lucasian Professor of Mathematics Stephen Hawking was the 300th Steve to sign the list. By the time the announcement was made on April 21, 2003, another five had joined to bring the total number of Steves to 305. By December 26, 2003, St. Stephen&#x27;s Day, &quot;Project Steve&quot; had grown to 400 scientists.

As Project Steve reached the 400 scientist mark, the NCSE decided to offer a commemorative novelty Project Steve t-shirt. The t-shirt is emblazoned with the proclamation, &quot;Over _00 Scientists named Steve Agree, Teach Evolution!&quot; in large letters, where the blank contains the most recent hundreds mark. A list of the current signatories is included in a smaller typeface on the t-shirt as well.

Eugenie Scott, Glenn Branch and Nick Matzke published an article in the July/August 2004 issue of the &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot; (with all the Steves that had signed up to that point listed as co-authors) called &quot;The Morphology of Steve&quot; which contained &quot;the first scientific analysis of the sex, geographic location, and body size of scientists named Steve&quot;. The data were obtained using NCSE&#x27;s &quot;pioneering experimental steveometry apparatus&quot;—the t-shirt.

Shortly after the second anniversary of Project Steve in February 2005, 543 Steves had signed the list. A front-page story in the Ottawa Citizen marking this event was published on February 20, 2005. On September 12, 2005, the 600th Steve signed the list. By February 16, 2006, the third anniversary of &quot;Project Steve&quot;&#x27;s official launch, the Steve-o-meter stood at 700. On April 24, 2007, the list had grown to 800 Steves. In February 2009, the milestone #1000 was assigned to professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Steven P. Darwin (no relation to Charles). Subsequent milestones were #1100 on August 25, 2009, #1200 on April 6, 2012, and #1300 on January 15, 2014.

There have been articles about &quot;Project Steve&quot; in &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, Focus on the Family&#x27;s &quot;Family News in Focus&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, MIT&#x27;s &quot;TechTalk&quot;, and &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, among many others.

==Reactions==
William Dembski, fellow of the Discovery Institute, whose &quot;&quot;Scientific Dissent from Darwinism&quot; petition had eight Steves as of July, 2007, has said that:

Inspired by Project Steve, and motivated by media coverage of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s &quot;Dissent From Darwinism&quot;&quot; list, during the &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; case, R. Joe Brandon initiated a four-day, word-of-mouth petition of scientists in support of evolution in October 2005. During the four-day drive &quot;A Scientific Support For Darwinism And For Public Schools Not To Teach Intelligent Design As Science&quot; gathered 7733 signatures of verifiable scientists. During the four days of the petition, &quot;A Scientific Support for Darwinism&quot; received signatures at a rate 697,000% higher than the Discovery Institute&#x27;s petition, &quot;A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism&quot;, according to archaeologist R. Joe Brandon.

<doc id="642974" wikidata="Q1939105" url="?curid=642974" title="William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey">
<text>William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (died 11 May 1138) was the son of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey and his first wife Gundred. He was more often referred to as &quot;Earl Warenne&quot; or &quot;Earl of Warenne&quot; than as Earl of Surrey.

==Life==
His father, the 1st Earl, was one of the Conqueror&#x27;s most trusted and most rewarded barons who, at his death in 1088, was the third- or fourth-richest magnate in England. In 1088 William II inherited his father&#x27;s lands in England and his Norman estates including the castles of Mortemer and Bellencombre in Haute-Normandy. But William II was not as disposed to serve the king as his father was. In January 1091, William assisted Hugh de Grandmesnil (died 1094) in his defence of Courcy against the forces of Robert de Belleme and Duke Robert of Normandy. In 1093 he attempted to marry Matilda (or Edith), daughter of king Malcolm III of Scotland. She instead married Henry I of England, and this may have been the cause of William&#x27;s great dislike of Henry I, which motivated him in the following years.

When Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy invaded England in 1101 William joined him. But when Curthose promptly surrendered to Henry I, William lost his English lands and titles and was exiled to Normandy. There he complained to Curthose that he had expended great effort on the duke&#x27;s behalf and in return lost all of his English possessions. Curthose&#x27;s return to England in 1103 was apparently made to convince his brother, the king, to restore William&#x27;s earldom. This was successful, though Curthose had to give up his 3,000-mark annual pension he had received after the 1101 invasion, after which William&#x27;s lands and titles were restored to him.

To further insure William&#x27;s loyalty Henry considered marrying him to one of his many illegitimate daughters. Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury forbade the marriage based on the couple being related in the fourth generation on one side, and in the sixth generation on the other. William was one of the commanders on Henry&#x27;s side (against Robert Curthose) at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106. Afterwards, with his loyalty thus proven, he became more prominent in Henry&#x27;s court.

In 1110, Curthose&#x27;s son William Clito escaped along with Helias of Saint-Saens, and afterwards Warenne received the forfeited Saint-Saens lands, which were very near his own in upper Normandy. In this way king Henry further assured his loyalty, for the successful return of Clito would mean at the very least Warenne&#x27;s loss of this new territory. He fought for Henry I at the Battle of Bremule in 1119. William, the second Earl of Surrey was present at Henry&#x27;s deathbed in 1135. After the king&#x27;s death disturbances broke out in Normandy and William was sent to guard Rouen and the Pays de Caux.

William was a donor to a number of priories, with his donations being mentioned in charters issued between 1130 and 1138 to Longueville Priory near Rouen, Normandy and to the priory of Bellencombre (also near Rouen) in 1135. His sons and his wife were witnesses to many of these charters.

William&#x27;s death is recorded as 11 May 1138 in the register of Lewes Priory and he was buried at his father&#x27;s feet at the chapter house there. His wife, the countess Elizabeth, survived him, dying before July 1147.

==Family==
In 1118, William finally acquired the royal-blooded bride he desired when he married Elizabeth of Vermandois. She was a daughter of Hugh I, Count of Vermandois and granddaughter of Henry I, King of France, as well as the widow of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester. 

By his wife Elizabeth, he had three sons and two daughters:

* William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey
* Reginald de Warenne, who inherited his father&#x27;s property in upper Normandy, including the castles of Bellencombre and Morteme. He married Alice de Wormegay, daughter of William de Wormegay, Lord of Wormegay in Norfolk, by whom he had a son, William de Warenne (founder of the priory of Wormegay), whose daughter and sole heir, Beatrice de Warenne, married, firstly, Doun, Lord Bardolf, and, secondly, Hubert de Burgh. Reginald was one of the persecutors of Archbishop Thomas Becket in 1170.
* Ralph de Warenne
* Gundred de Warenne, who married, firstly, Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick, and, secondly, William de Lancaster, Lord of Kendal, and is most remembered for expelling King Stephen&#x27;s garrison from Warwick Castle.
* Ada de Warenne, who married Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, and was the mother of two Scottish kings. She made many grants to the priory of Lewes.

<doc id="642978" wikidata="Q1625275" url="?curid=642978" title="Humphrey II of Toron">
<text>Humphrey II of Toron (1117 – 22 April 1179) was lord of Toron and constable of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He was the son of Humphrey I of Toron.

Humphrey had become lord of Toron sometime before 1140 when he married the daughter of Renier Brus, lord of Banias (the Herodian city of Caesarea Philippi). Through this marriage, Banias was added to Toron. Humphrey became castellan of Hebron in 1149 when Hebron became a domain of the royal family of Jerusalem. In 1153 he became constable of Jerusalem when Baldwin III of Jerusalem became sole ruler after a struggle with his mother Melisende. That year he was present with the king at the Siege of Ascalon.

Humphrey was defeated by Nur ad-Din at Banias in 1157 and was besieged in its castle until Baldwin III arrived to lift the siege. That year Humphrey also sold Banias and Chastel Neuf to the Knights Hospitaller (Chastel Neuf was captured by Nur ad-Din in 1167). Also in 1157 he helped negotiate the marriage of Baldwin III and Theodora, niece of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus. Humphrey himself later married Philippa, sister of Bohemund III of Antioch, who had previously had an affair with future Byzantine emperor Andronicus I Comnenus, Manuel&#x27;s cousin. Humphrey had been married before, to an unknown woman, and his marriage with Philippa produced no children.

In 1173 Humphrey relieved Nur ad-Din&#x27;s siege of Kerak in Oultrejordain. In 1176 his importance at the royal court was somewhat lessened due to the influence of Agnes of Courtenay, but he kept his position as constable. In 1177 this lessened importance was manifested when the lordship of Hebron was recreated and given to Raynald of Châtillon, lord of Oultrejordain, rather than Humphrey, who was still castellan. Nevertheless, he was one of the supporters of the Raymond III of Tripoli, regent for Baldwin IV. Raymond, Humphrey, and others represented the faction of old families at court, who were opposed to newcomers like Raynald, and later Guy of Lusignan.

Humphrey rebuilt Chateau Neuf in 1179 after it had been destroyed in various sieges. Also in 1179, he helped negotiate a truce between the Knights Hospitaller and Knights Templar. Later that year he accompanied Baldwin IV in an attack on a small Muslim force near Banias, but, although he saved Baldwin IV&#x27;s life, he suffered mortal wounds and died at his castle at Hunin on 22 April. He was succeeded in Toron by his 13-year-old grandson Humphrey IV, son of Humphrey III and Stephanie of Milly; Humphrey III of Toron was his son by his unknown first wife.

<doc id="642980" wikidata="Q716129" url="?curid=642980" title="William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey">
<text>William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey (11196 January 1148) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman, member of the House of Warenne, who fought in England during the Anarchy and generally remained loyal to King Stephen. He participated in, and ultimately perished during, the Second Crusade.

==Origins==
He was the eldest son of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (died 1138) by his wife Elizabeth de Vermandois. He was a great-grandson of King Henry I of France, and half-brother to Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, Waleran IV de Beaumont, Count of Meulan, and Hugh de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Bedford.

==Life==
Still in his minority in 1137 he was serving with Stephen, King of England in Normandy being one of those young nobles who initially fled the battle. Stephen pursued them, held them and did his best to pacify them but did not make them fight. At his father&#x27;s death in 1138, William became the third Earl of Surrey. At Easter 1138, he accompanied his half-brother Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester on an embassy to Paris for the purpose of ratifying a treaty between the English and French kings. On 2 February 1141, he and his half-brother Waleran were again with King Stephen at the Battle of Lincoln but fled at the initial charge of the enemy forces. They both joined Queen Matilda but on King Stephen&#x27;s release they were once again among his followers, and William witnessed a royal charter at Canterbury in late 1141.

===Charters===
With his brother Ralph, William was a joint donor in numerous charters issued by his parents and was a witness to his father&#x27;s charter, all to Longueville Priory near Rouen, Normandy (between 1130 and 1138). He was also a donor with his brother and both parents to the priory of Bellencombre (also near Rouen) in 1135. 

William was also the primary donor in a number of charters after his father died, between 1138 and 1147. One of particular instance occurred during a livery of seisin in 1147. 

At that event, William gave a large gift to the Lewes Priory which was secured with a lock of hair from his own and from his brother Ralph&#x27;s head cut by Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, before the altar of the priory church. Lewes Priory had been founded by William&#x27;s grandparents, William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, and his wife Gundrada, probably in 1081.

==Marriage and children==
William married Adela (&quot;alias&quot; Ela), daughter of Count William III of Ponthieu (also called William Talvas), by his wife Helie daughter of Odo I, Duke of Burgundy. They had one child and sole heiress, a daughter, Isabel de Warenne, &quot;suo jure&quot; 4th Countess of Surrey. She married firstly William of Blois (died 1159), the second son of king Stephen, who became Earl Warenne or Earl of Surrey. After he died childless in October 1159, she remarried to Hamelin, half-brother of King Henry II, who became Earl Warenne, or Earl of Surrey. He adopted the surname &quot;de Warenne&quot;, and the earldom continued in his descendants.

==Death on crusade==
He was one of the nobles who, along with his second cousin, King Louis VII of France, took crusading vows at the Council of Vézelay in 1146, and he accompanied the initial army of the Second Crusade the next year. William was killed at the Battle of Mount Cadmus while the crusader army was marching across Anatolia on their way to the Holy Land.

In December 1147, the French-Norman force reached Ephesus. They were joined by remnants of the army of the Holy Roman Empire, which had previously suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Dorylaeum in 1147. They marched across southwest Turkey and fought an unsuccessful battle at Laodicea (3–4 January 1148) on the border between the Byzantine Empire and the Sultanate of Rum. 

On 6 January 1148, they battled again in the area of Mount Cadmus, where Turks ambushed the infantry and non-combatants only, because they had become separated from the rest of the army. King Louis VII and his bodyguard of Knights Templars and noblemen recklessly charged the Turks. Most of the knights were killed, including William, and Louis barely escaped with his life. His army arrived later at the coastal city of Adalia. The battle is recorded by Odo of Deuil, personal chaplain to Louis, in his narrative, &quot;De Profectione&quot;.

<doc id="642982" wikidata="Q160603" url="?curid=642982" title="Trade winds">
<text>The trade winds or easterlies are permanent east-to-west prevailing winds that flow in the Earth&#x27;s equatorial region. The trade winds blow mainly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere, strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase. Trade winds have been used by captains of sailing ships to cross the world&#x27;s oceans for centuries. They enabled European colonization of the Americas, and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

In meteorology, they act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic, Pacific, and southern Indian oceans and cause rainfall in North America, Southeast Asia, and Madagascar and East Africa. Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion, which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge. The weaker the trade winds become, the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses.

The trade winds also transport nitrate- and phosphate-rich Saharan dust to all Latin America, the Caribbean Sea, and to parts of southeastern and southwestern North America. Sahara dust is on occasion present in sunsets across Florida. When dust from the Sahara travels over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates.

== History ==
The term originally derives from the early fourteenth century sense of trade (in late Middle English) still often meaning &quot;path&quot; or &quot;track&quot;. The Portuguese recognized the importance of the trade winds (then the &quot;volta do mar&quot;, meaning in Portuguese &quot;turn of the sea&quot; but also &quot;return from the sea&quot;) in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic Ocean as early as the 15th century. From West Africa, the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Africa, that is, to west and northwest. They could then turn northeast, to the area around the Azores islands, and finally east to mainland Europe. They also learned that to reach South Africa, they needed to go far out in the ocean, head for Brazil, and around 30°S go east again. (This is because following the African coast southbound means sailing upwind in the Southern hemisphere.) In the Pacific Ocean, the full wind circulation, which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher-latitude westerlies, was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta&#x27;s voyage in 1565.

The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel. During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.
By the 18th century, the importance of the trade winds to England&#x27;s merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of &quot;trade&quot;: &quot;(foreign) commerce&quot;. Between 1847 and 1849, Matthew Fontaine Maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world&#x27;s oceans.

== Cause ==
As part of the Hadley cell, surface air flows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles. A low-pressure area of calm, light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums, near-equatorial trough, intertropical front, or the Intertropical Convergence Zone. When located within a monsoon region, this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known as the monsoon trough. Around 30° in both hemispheres, air begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical high-pressure belts known as subtropical ridges. The subsident (sinking) air is relatively dry because as it descends, the temperature increases, but the moisture content remains constant, which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass. This warm, dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical (warm and moist) air mass. An increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion. When it occurs within a trade wind regime, it is known as a trade wind inversion.

The surface air that flows from these subtropical high-pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the Coriolis effect. These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. Because winds are named for the direction from which the wind is blowing, these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere. The trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the Doldrums.

As they blow across tropical regions, air masses heat up over lower latitudes due to more direct sunlight. Those that develop over land (continental) are drier and hotter than those that develop over oceans (maritime), and travel northward on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. Maritime tropical air masses are sometimes referred to as trade air masses. All tropical oceans except the northern Indian Ocean have extensive areas of trade winds.

== Weather and biodiversity effects ==
Clouds which form above regions within trade wind regimes are typically composed of cumulus which extend no more than in height, and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion. Trade winds originate more from the direction of the poles (northeast in the Northern Hemisphere, southeast in the Southern Hemisphere) during the cold season, and are stronger in the winter than the summer. As an example, the windy season in the Guianas, which lie at low latitudes in South America, occurs between January and April. When the phase of the Arctic oscillation (AO) is warm, trade winds are stronger within the tropics. The cold phase of the AO leads to weaker trade winds. When the trade winds are weaker, more extensive areas of rain fall upon landmasses within the tropics, such as Central America.

During mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere (July), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean Sea into southeastern North America (Florida and Gulf Coast). When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge travels over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Although the Southeast US has some of the cleanest air in North America, much of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s.

Every year, millions of tons of nutrient-rich Saharan dust cross the Atlantic Ocean, bringing vital phosphorus and other fertilizers to depleted Amazon soils.

<text>Tzomet (, lit., &quot;Crossroads&quot;) is a small, right-wing political party in Israel.

==History==
The party was founded by General Rafael Eitan in 1983, after his retirement from the position of chief-of-staff in 1982. He headed it throughout its existence, and modeled it in his spirit as a secular, right-wing party with a strong agricultural side. Many of Tzomet&#x27;s members and MKs were neighbors of Eitan in Tel Adashim (a small moshav). Tzomet ran for the 1984 elections in a joint list with the Tehiya party, and Eitan was its only member of the Knesset. Tzomet and the Tehiya parted way in 1987, and Tzomet ran independently in the 1988 elections, winning two seats. The party joined Yitzhak Shamir&#x27;s government in 1990, and Eitan was appointed Minister of Agriculture. However, the party left the coalition in December 1991 in protest at Shamir&#x27;s participation in the Madrid Conference.

In the 1992 elections, Tzomet rode a wave of secularist sentiment, gaining the support of many young Israelis, leading to a surprising result of eight seats. Despite Tzomet&#x27;s success it was not included in Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s left-wing coalition. The party&#x27;s surprising success was also its downfall. None of the new MKs had any political experience, and most were completely unknown. Due to Raful&#x27;s position in his party, the party was jokingly described as &quot;Raful and the seven dwarfs&quot;. Allegations of tyrannical behavior by Raful were raised, and in February 1992, three members: Gonen Segev, Esther Salmovitz, and Alex Goldfarb—left and founded the Yiud party (which then also splintered into Atid). The three left the party because Segev was offered the position of Minister of Energy by Yitzhak Rabin if he voted in favour of the Oslo Accords, which Tzomet opposed, and which would not have passed without his vote.

The splintering and infighting reduced the popularity of the party, despite this, ahead of the 1996 elections, Eitan became known as a potential candidate for PM. In the end Tzomet chose to run in a joint list with the Likud and Gesher under the name &quot;National Camp List&quot;. Tzomet was ensured several relatively high places in the combined list, partly as a reward for the withdrawal of Eitan as prime minister candidate, as the Likud feared that he would act as a spoiler for their candidate, Benjamin Netanyahu. The 1996 elections were the first Israeli elections to feature a double vote: one for the Knesset, and one direct vote for the prime minister. As part of the joint list, Tzomet managed to get all five of its Knesset members back into the Knesset. However, over the course of the next few years, Tzomet continued to splinter: Pini Badash left to run in municipal politics, Moshe Peled broke away to form his own Mekhora faction before joining Moledet while Eliezer Sandberg left to form the Centre Party. By the end of the 14th Knesset, Tzomet only had 2 MKs left: Eitan himself and Haim Dayan.

Following the dissolution of the Likud–Gesher–Tzomet alliance ahead of the 1999 elections, Tzomet was in the &quot;political desert&quot;, it attempted to join the National Union joint list or rejoin an alliance with the Likud, however both ventures failed and Tzomet ran alone for the Knesset. Over the years Tzomet had lost almost all its support, and won just 4,128 votes, less than 10% of the number needed to cross the 1.5% electoral threshold. After the humiliating defeat, Eitan retired from the political life. Following the retirement of Eitan, the party faded into obscurity in the Israeli political scene

Despite Rafael Eitan&#x27;s departure, the party, now headed by Moshe Gerin, ran in the 2003, the 2006 elections, and the 2009 elections, but won only 2,023, 1,342, and 1,520 votes, respectively, in the three elections, not meeting the election threshold in any of them. Following their failure to reach the threshold in four successive elections, the party decided not to run in the 2013 and 2015 elections.

==Modern Tzomet==

In the lead up to the April 2019 elections, Likud MK Oren Hazan failed to achieve a realistic spot in the Likud list, receiving only a small number of votes in the primaries. Following his failure in the Likud primaries, Oren Hazan declared that he would leave the Likud and head his own party, taking over the long-dormant Tzomet party.

Hazan reformed the party, abandoning Eitan&#x27;s secularism and statesmanlike conduct in favor of Hazan&#x27;s own rightwing populist policy and rhetoric. Under Hazan, Tzomet received the best result since Eitan&#x27;s departure, earning 2,417 votes. Despite Hazan&#x27;s marginal success, this result was far from enough to reach the electoral threshold, and Oren Hazan lost his Knesset seat.

Following Hazan&#x27;s failure to revive the party, it returned to the hands of Moshe Gerin who brought the party back to its original form, focusing on agrarianism and settlement. The party received an even better result in the September 2019 elections, receiving 14,805 votes (0.33% of the popular vote).

==Ideology==

Tzomet&#x27;s ideology was heavily reflective of Rafael Eitan (Raful) himself. Eitan was a moshavnik, as such, he was influenced by the moshavnik agricultural, nationalist and secularist ideology. 
Raful&#x27;s Tzomet&#x27;s platform included:
* Separation of religion and state and military recruitment of Ultra Orthodox Jews.
* Annexation of the West Bank.
* Restricting voting rights only to those who have completed national service.
* Switching to a presidential system.
* Aggressive policy against Palestinian terrorism.
* Economic policy based on economic liberalism and agriculture.

Under the leadership of Oren Hazan, Tzomet&#x27;s ideology changed considerably. Tzomet no longer mentioned any changes to Israel&#x27;s voting or government system. Hazan shifted Tzomet&#x27;s focus away from secularism and recruitment of the Ultra Orthodox. Under Hazan, Tzomet focused primarily on criticizing Netanyahu&#x27;s defense policy from the right and supporting more aggressive measures against terrorism and against the Israeli Arab members of the Knesset. After Hazan left the party, and Moshe Gerin came back to lead it, Tzomet&#x27;s ideology returned to its agrarianist base. The party&#x27;s support dwindled 280 times in the fall-winter 2019.

<doc id="642989" wikidata="Q1344508" url="?curid=642989" title="William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey">
<text>William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey (born 1160s–1170s, died 27 May 1240) was the son of Isabel de Warenne, 4th Countess of Surrey (suo jure) and Hamelin de Warenne. His father Hamelin granted him the manor of Appleby, North Lincolnshire.

== Origins ==
Although he spent most of his life in England he was raised in Normandy. In 1194 William de Warenne was one of those who with Richard I of England licensed the reopening of tournament circuits in England. Through his grandfather Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou he was cousin to kings Richard and John, and uncle to king Henry III. His father Hamelin de Warenne was son of Geoffrey Plantagenet who married Isabel de Warenne and adopted the surname. Therefore, he inherited royal connections through his paternal line and the Earldom of Surrey through his maternal line, a very powerful combination. De Warenne was present at the coronation of John, King of England on 27 May 1199. When Normandy was lost to the French in 1204 he lost his Norman holdings (in 1202 he was lieutenant of Gascony), but John recompensed him with lordship over the important towns of Grantham and Stamford. Such generous grants were not surprising for a royal cousin who posed no threat to the throne and as his sister Adela de Warenne was one of John&#x27;s mistresses.

== Tournament ==
Based on an example letter, which was likely copied from a real letter, he was in correspondence with William de Forz, 3rd Earl of Albemarle whom he considered a great knight and whom he wanted to join his tournament team some time between 1210 and 1240. The letter reads:

:The earl of Warenne to the count of Aumale, greetings. That which ceases from use has prepared the way for its own retirement. We knights are being kept from action like unskilled clodhoppers; this long interval of sitting around, which prevents the practice of knightly exercise, gives one kidney stones. You will have heard that a certain tournament has been sworn between us and O., the earl of such-and-such a place. We beg you with our utmost affection to come to it. Since we are unfit, we trust in your integrity as to a city; to your triumphal banner as to a castle with its walls and surrounding moat, which is accustomed to be the refuge of the weary and of those oppressed by an adverse fate. And those who are accustomed to our protection in the best possible manner have committed themselves to being defended [by] the might of your protection. We also desire your presence there all the more because we believe it will be essential to us.

== Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports ==
His first tenure of office as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports began in 1204, and lasted until 1206; he was again appointed as Warden in 1214. He was also a Warden of the Welsh Marches between 1208 and 1213. Between the years 1200 and 1208, and between 1217 and 1226 he was to serve as the High Sheriff of Surrey.

== Loyalist during the Rebellion ==
De Warenne was one of the few barons who remained loyal to his cousin, King John. In 1212, when a general rebellion was feared, John committed to him the custody of the northern shires. During the king&#x27;s difficulties with the barons, when they sought for the French prince to assume the English throne, William is listed as one of those who advised John to accede to &quot;Magna Carta&quot;. His allegiance only faltered a few times when the king&#x27;s cause looked hopeless; shortly before the death of John, he made terms with Prince Louis. In March 1217 he again demonstrated his loyalty to England by supporting the young King Henry III, and he was also responsible for the establishment of Salisbury Cathedral. He refers to Hubert de Burgh in a letter from 1218 as his dearest friend and lord &quot;&quot;sicut dominum et amicum carissimum&quot;.&quot;

However, he disliked the royal favorites who came into power after 1227, and used his influence to protect Hubert de Burgh when the latter had been removed from office by their efforts in 1232. Warenne&#x27;s relations with the king became strained in course of time. In 1238 he was evidently regarded as a leader of the baronial opposition, for the Great Council appointed him as one of the treasurers who were to prevent the king from squandering the subsidy voted in that year.

== Marriage and issue ==
William married Maud Marshal, widow of Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk, on 13 October 1225. They had one son, John, and a daughter, Isabel. John (1231–1304) succeeded his father as earl, while Isabel ( – 1282) married Hugh d&#x27;Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel. William may also have had an earlier, childless marriage to another Maud, daughter of William d&#x27;Aubigny, 2nd Earl of Arundel.

<text>Mohandas Dewese (born August 8, 1962), better known by his stage name Kool Moe Dee, is an American rapper, songwriter and actor. Considered one of the forerunners of the new jack swing sound in hip hop, he gained fame in the 1980s as a member of one of the pioneering groups in hip hop music, the Treacherous Three, and for his later solo career. During his career he released a total of seven studio albums (five of them solo), with 1994&#x27;s &quot;Interlude&quot; being the last to date.

His fast and aggressive rap style influenced following rap figures such as Big Daddy Kane, Beastie Boys, KRS-One, Rakim, Will Smith, N.W.A, Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay-Z, among others. Among his most famous songs are &quot;Go See the Doctor&quot;, &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; and &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot;.

Kool Moe Dee was ranked  33 on About.com&#x27;s list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007).

==Early life and education==
Born Mohandas Dewese in Harlem, Kool Moe Dee attended the State University of New York at Old Westbury, where he received a degree in communications in 1985.

==Career==
One of Kool Moe Dee&#x27;s first feats was being part of the first major rap battle in history. He lyrically attacked Busy Bee after one of his performances in 1981. He was extremely mad at Busy Bee, for talking smack about other MC&#x27;s, claiming that none of them could beat him in a contest. Moe Dee used some of his rhymes from &quot;The New Rap Language&quot; and &quot;Whip It&quot;. He also used a little bit of Busy Bee&#x27;s style during the battle. In 1985, the Treacherous Three disbanded. In 1986, he went solo, releasing a self-titled album that ranked 83 on &quot;Billboard&quot;. After meeting a young up and coming artist at Sugar Hill records by the name of Lavaba Mallison, who would later become his manager, Kool Moe Dee left Sugar Hill records to join Lavaba Mallison, Robert &quot;Gusto&quot; Wells, Greg Marius and up and coming producer Teddy Riley at the newly founded ROOFTOP records. He co-operated with the young producers Teddy Riley and Lavaba Mallison which contributed to the new jack swing movement that would gain popularity in the years to follow.

Kool Moe Dee released his second album, &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; which was his most successful album commercially, achieving platinum status. He then went on to release his third album, &quot;Knowledge Is King&quot; in 1989, which went gold. In 1990, he performed on Quincy Jones&#x27; album &quot;Back on the Block&quot; along with fellow rappers Melle Mel, Big Daddy Kane and Ice-T. The album gained considerable critical and financial success and won the 1991 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 1991, the release of his album &quot;Funke, Funke Wisdom&quot; signaled Kool Moe Dee&#x27;s decline. Moe Dee himself has stated that this was his worst album. He induced his release from Jive Records in 1992. After a two-year lay off, he released his greatest hits album which regained some of his former success and acclaim. In 1994, his album &quot;Interlude&quot; was released and failed to gain Moe Dee much of his former success of the mid-1980s. In 1993, he re-united with his fellow ex members of the Treacherous Three to release the album &quot;Old School Flava&quot; on Ichiban. His last commercial release was the single &quot;Love Love/What You Wanna Do&quot; which was released on Spoiled Brat Entertainment Inc. Moe Dee appeared in the MTV box office bomb &quot;Crossroads&quot; as a bartender.

=== Feud with LL Cool J ===
Kool Moe Dee conducted a long-running rivalry with fellow New York rapper LL Cool J. Along with other rappers such as MC Shan, Kool Moe Dee claimed that LL had stolen their rap styles. He also felt that LL was disrespecting rap pioneers such as Melle Mel and Grandmaster Caz by proclaiming that he was &quot;rap&#x27;s new grandmaster&quot; without paying due respect to those who came before him. He challenged LL on his platinum selling album &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; on the single of the same name. He also took a shot at LL by appearing on the album cover with a jeep in the background with the wheel crushing one of LL&#x27;s trademark red Kangol hats.

===&quot;Behind The Rhyme&quot; talk show===
In 2017 he launched as executive producer and host of &quot;Behind The Rhyme&quot;, a digital talk show series featuring an interview with a hip-hop legend or current star. The premiere episode was released in June 2020, featuring Chuck D, front man of Public Enemy and supergroup Prophets of Rage. The show is executive produced by industry veterans Ann Carli and Devin DeHaven, who also directs the series.

<text>The Blue River is a small river in the South Island of New Zealand. It flows its entire length within the Mount Aspiring National Park, and although on the southeastern side of the main divide, the river is within the boundaries of the West Coast region for its entire length.

The headwaters are southeast of the main range of the Southern Alps near the mountain Eyetooth, with the smaller Blue River North Branch and South Branch joining the main Blue River later. Shortly before flowing into the Makarora River, the river passes through a narrow gorge.

At its confluence with the Makarora River, the aptly named Blue Pools are the destination of a popular short walk from , with a bridge crossing the Blue River and providing good views upstream into the gorge and downstream over the river flowing into Makarora River. The longer Blue Valley tramping track leads deep into the Blue River Valley and along most of the length of the river.

<doc id="642996" wikidata="Q1153188" url="?curid=642996" title="Mount Lucania">
<text>Mount Lucania in Yukon is the third-highest mountain in Canada (5240 metres), and the second-highest mountain located entirely within the country (the summit of Mount Saint Elias, Canada&#x27;s second highest peak, is shared with the US state of Alaska). A long ridge connects Mount Lucania with Mount Steele (), the fifth-highest in Canada. Lucania was named by the Duke of Abruzzi, as he stood on the summit of Mount Saint Elias on July 31, 1897, having just completed the first ascent. Seeing Lucania in the far distance, beyond Mount Logan, he immediately named it &quot;after the ship on which the expedition had sailed from Liverpool to New York,&quot; the RMS &quot;Lucania&quot;.

== Climbing History ==
;First Ascent
The first ascent of Mount Lucania was made in 1937 by Bradford Washburn and Robert Hicks Bates. They used an airplane to reach Walsh Glacier, above sea level; the use of air support for mountaineering was novel at the time. Washburn called upon Bob Reeve, a famous Alaskan bush pilot, who later replied by cable to Washburn, &quot;Anywhere you&#x27;ll ride, I&#x27;ll fly&quot;. The ski-equipped Fairchild F-51 made several trips to the landing site on the glacier without event in May, but on landing with Washburn and Bates in June, the plane sank into unseasonal slush. Washburn, Bates and Reeve pressed hard for five days to get the airplane out and Reeve was eventually able to get the airplane airborne with all excess weight removed and with the assistance of a smooth icefall with a steep drop. Washburn and Bates continued on foot to make the first ascent of Lucania, and in an epic descent and journey to civilization, they hiked over through the wilderness to safety in the small town of Burwash Landing in the Yukon.

Washburn&#x27;s party was forced to abandon a great deal of gear—more than 1,000 pounds of cameras, surveying equipment and other supplies—on Walsh Glacier. In 2022, an expedition led by U.S. professional skier Griffin Post located Washburn&#x27;s lost equipment, which had been carried 14 miles from its original location by the glacier. Assisted by officials from Canada&#x27;s National Park Service and a team of archaeologists, much of the gear was collected and cleaned.

;Subsequent Notable Ascents
The second ascent of Lucania was made in 1967 by Jerry Halpern, Mike Humphreys, Gary Lukis, and Gerry Roach.

In April–May 2021, Pascale Marceau and Eva Capozzola summited the peak, the first all-woman team of climbers to do so.

<doc id="643001" wikidata="Q681841" url="?curid=643001" title="Leberkäse">
<text>(German, literally &#x27;liver-cheese&#x27;; sometimes also &quot;Leberkäs&quot; or &quot;Leberka(a)s&quot;) in Austria and the Swabian, Bavarian and Franconian parts of Germany, &#x27;leverkaas&#x27; in the Netherlands and &quot;Fleischkäse&quot; (&quot;meat-cheese&quot;) in Saarland, Baden, Switzerland and Tyrol) is a speciality food found in the south of Germany, in Austria and parts of Switzerland. It consists of beef, pork and bacon and is made by grinding the ingredients very finely and then baking it as a loaf in a bread pan until it has a crunchy brown crust. Variations may be made using other kinds of meat such as horse meat or turkey, or may contain additional ingredients such as cheese or minced chili peppers.

&quot;Leberkäse&quot; is also called &quot;Fleischlaib&quot;, which literally means &quot;meat-loaf&quot; in German, but it is not a meatloaf, which in German is called &quot;Hackbraten&quot; (literally &quot;ground roast&quot;, from &quot;Hackfleisch&quot;, &quot;ground meat&quot;, and &quot;ein Braten&quot;, &quot;a &quot;), &quot;faschierter Braten&quot; (literally &quot;minced &quot;, from &quot;faschieren&quot;, &quot;to mince&quot;, and &quot;ein Braten&quot;, &quot;a &quot;), &quot;Wiegebraten&quot;, &quot;falscher Hase&quot; (&quot;false hare&quot; or &quot;faux hare&quot;) and &quot;Heuchelhase&quot; (&quot;mock-hare&quot;).

== Consumption ==
&quot;Leberkäse&quot; is traditionally enjoyed in a variety of ways, including:
*Most of the time, it is served hot on a &quot;Semmel&quot; (hard wheat flour bread-roll) and traditionally seasoned with mustard or pickles. The result, generally called &quot;Leberkäsesemmel&quot; (in Swabia and the Franconian parts of Bavaria, &quot;Leberkäsweckle&quot;, &quot;Leberkäsweggla&quot; or &quot;LKW&quot; in short, an allusion to the abbreviation for &quot;Lastkraftwagen&quot;, heavy goods vehicle), is a staple of Southern German and Austrian fast food stalls, butcher shops and supermarkets.
*Cut into approximately finger-thick slices, usually served with traditionally medium hot mustard or Bavarian sweet mustard or sometimes ketchup and accompanied by soft pretzels or &quot;Kartoffelsalat&quot; (potato salad).
*Pan-fried (&quot;abgebräunt&quot; or &quot;gebraten&quot;, &quot;browned&quot;), in which case it is commonly accompanied by a fried egg and German potato salad, or &quot;Bratkartoffeln&quot; (home fries) and sometimes spinach. This is a very common &quot;Biergarten&quot; dish.
*Cold, cut into very thin slices and used on a variety of sandwiches, usually seasoned with pickled cucumbers. 
*Two slices of &quot;Leberkäse&quot; with a slice of ham and cheese in the middle are dipped into eggs and coated with breadcrumbs and then fried in the pan. This variant is called &quot;falsches Cordon Bleu&quot; (&quot;mock Cordon Bleu&quot;).

== Variants ==

Known variants include:

<text>Ole Nydahl (born 19 March 1941), also known as Lama Ole, is a &quot;lama&quot; providing Mahamudra teachings in the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. Since the early 1970s, Nydahl has toured the world giving lectures and meditation courses. With his wife, Hannah Nydahl (1946-2007), he founded Diamond Way Buddhism, a worldwide Karma Kagyu Buddhist organization with over 600 centers for lay practitioners.

Nydahl is the author of more than twenty books (in German and English) about Diamond Way Vajrayana Buddhism, with translations into multiple languages. Titles include &quot;The Great Seal: Mahamudra View of Diamond Way Buddhism&quot;,&quot;The Way Things Are&quot;, &quot;Entering the Diamond Way&quot;, &quot;Buddha and Love&quot; and &quot;Fearless Death&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ole Nydahl was born north of Copenhagen into an academic family. Growing up in Denmark during the second world war, Nydahl witnessed his parents working in the Danish resistance movement, helping transport Jews to neutral Sweden. In the early 1960s, he served briefly in the Danish Army, then studied philosophy, English, and German at the University of Copenhagen, where he completed the examen philosophicum with the best possible grade. He began but did not finish a doctoral thesis on Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;. As a young man, Nydahl was involved in boxing, motorcycles, race car driving and also travelled overland from Denmark to Nepal several times. As described in his autobiography &quot;Entering the Diamond Way&quot;, his travels were financed through smuggling, for which he was once arrested and detained in Denmark. He used this time in pre-trial detention for meditation and read &quot;Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrine&quot; by Walter Evans-Wentz.

==Involvement with Buddhism==
===Buddhist education===
In 1968, Ole Nydahl and his wife Hannah travelled to Nepal on their honeymoon. In Nepal they met their first Buddhist teacher, the Drukpa Kagyu master Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche. In December 1969, the Nydahls met Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa, head of the Karma Kagyu lineage. Nine years after the British woman Freda Bedi became the first Western student of the 16th Karmapa, the Nydahls took refuge and became students of the Karmapa. They studied and meditated in the Himalayas, where they completed the Ngöndro or preliminary practices in six months, and had explanations and empowerments for 8th Karmapa guru yoga meditation practice and other methods. During this time the Nydahls also became students of Mipham Chokyi Lodro, the fourteenth Shamarpa, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul, and Kalu Rinpoche in Sonada. From the Karmapa, the Nydahls learned about Vajrayana Buddhism and mahamudra, and received the Kagyu Ngagdzo transmission. From the Shamarpa, they took the Bodhisattva vows and learned about Gampopa&#x27;s Jewel Ornament of Liberation. They learned phowa from Ayang Rinpoche in 1972. In addition, the Nydahls received teachings and empowerments from various Tibetan lamas, including Dilgo Khyentse, Bokar Rinpoche, Gyaltrul Rinpoche and the Dalai Lama.

===Teaching===

Upon returning to Europe in 1972, the 16th Karmapa asked Hannah and Ole Nydahl to begin teaching Buddhism and organize meditation centers, first in their native Denmark, then in Germany and other countries. The centers belong to the Karma Kagyu lineage and operate under Ole Nydahl&#x27;s practical guidance. In the early 90s, Diamond Way Buddhism was founded as a way to protect established centers during the Karmapa controversy.

, there were 635 Diamond Way centers throughout the world. Most are in Europe, Russia, or the United States.

Ole Nydahl regularly travels between them during the year giving lectures and meditation courses. Until 2013, Nydahl taught conscious dying or phowa, as well as other Buddhist meditation practices, but in recent years he has been focused on giving Mahamudra; teachings on the nature of mind. He traveled almost constantly for over 40 years, teaching in a new city nearly every day, until 2017 when his health necessitated reducing his travel schedule.

Together with his students, Nydahl has created Buddhist centers that provide access to Vajrayana meditation methods without requiring an understanding of Tibetan language or culture. In the Diamond Way centers, the meditations and names of the various Buddha forms have been translated into Western languages. Ole Nydahl believes it essential for people to understand and read the meditations in their own language in order for Buddhism to become truly rooted in the West, as noted in the preface to the meditation booklet titled Refuge and the Enlightened Attitude, used in Diamond Way Buddhist Centers, in which Nydahl states, &quot;This practice used to have an exotic edge because the repetition was in Tibetan. It has now been brought into a Western context, enabling us to understand it on a much deeper level.&quot;

Diamond Way centers are run entirely by volunteers; the organization does not maintain any paid staff. The organizational structure is intended to be democratic and to function on the basis of idealism and friendship. According to Buddhism Today, the Diamond Way Buddhist magazine, &quot;hierarchical systems will not sell with independent people in the West. Nobody wants a distant teacher on a pedestal or a big organization standing on their shoulders and telling them what to think.&quot;

Students in Diamond Way Centers practice the Ngöndro given by Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama, which are a set of four foundational practices that are intended to prepare the mind for enlightenment, and several forms of guru yoga or meditation on the lama, such as the 16th Karmapa meditation, and the 8th Karmapa meditation (as given by the 16th Karmapa). In a newsletter dated 9 July 2010, Nydahl responded to questions about the types of practices taught in Diamond Way Centers by stating &quot;I never taught anything I was not asked to pass on by the great Sixteenth Karmapa and that its basis was always the Guru Yogas of the Karmapas. Nothing else is practiced in our now 650 Diamond Way centers world-wide where my students meditate side by side.&quot; According to Bee Scherer, &quot;This trajectory is a deliberate yet restrictive selection from the vast richness of Kagyu practices&quot;, providing an introductory course into Karma Kagyu practices.

==Influence==
Jørn Borup, a professor of religion at Aarhus University, says that Ole Nydahl is &quot;the most lasting influence on the Buddhist practice scene in Denmark&quot; and &quot;has in many ways been the icon of living Buddhism in Denmark&quot;. The total number of Nydahl&#x27;s adherents is unknown, but can be estimated conservatively to include 15,000 to 70,000 students and casual sympathizers worldwide. In Germany alone, the German Buddhist Union, (Deutsche Buddhistische Union) estimates that about 20,000 persons regularly visit the Diamond Way centers and groups.

The 14th Shamar Rinpoche, Shamarpa, stated in his biography of the 16th Karmapa that &quot;it was Lama Ole who made the Karmapa&#x27;s name be renowned and through this, he established some 600 dharma centers,&quot; noting that Nydahls work &quot;is also the result of Gyalwa Karmapa&#x27;s activity.&quot;

As well as co-founder of Diamond Way with his wife Hannah Nydahl, Ole Nydahl is co-founder and chairman of the board of The Diamond Way Buddhism Foundation. A non-profit international foundation under German law, it supports projects worldwide, such as a library in Karma Guen (Malaga, Spain), which translates and preserves Buddhist texts; organizes cultural events such as Tibetan art exhibitions; and is responsible for building retreat centers and stupas in Europe and Russia.

==Controversy==
===Lama and lay siddhi-yogi===
In 1972, in a letter to Queen Margarethe of Denmark, the 16th Karmapa called Ole and Hannah Nydahl &quot;trusted pupils&quot;, entrusting them to establish &quot;a Centre and meditation centre&quot; in Denmark. According to Bee Scherer, a professor of gender studies and religious studies at Canterbury Christ Church University, &quot;Nydahl was not sent back in 1972 already as a &quot;lama&quot; in the sense of a traditionally trained and fully qualified Buddhist teacher.&quot; According to Scherer, Nydahl &quot;gained recognition as a Lama (bla ma, traditionally acknowledged teacher)&quot; in the period after the death of the Sixteenth Karmapa in 1981. In August 1983, he was &quot;finally acknowledged as a &quot;Buddhist Master&quot; by the lineage holder Shamar Rinpoche&quot;, the 14th Shamarpa, who certified that Nydahl is &quot;appointed Buddhist Master&quot;. Scherer notes that since 1995 &quot;the usage of &quot;Lama&quot; by higher Lamas in reference to Nydahl has been documented.&quot;

Nydahl&#x27;s &quot;self-identification and legitimization as a Western Karma bKa&#x27; brgyud lay teacher&quot; is an important part of a &quot;continual hagiographical tradition he and his inner circle are writing and rewriting&quot;. These hagiographies contribute to the cohesion of the Diamond Way, and &quot;this claim of normative transmission is emphasized in almost every public lecture given by Nydahl himself.&quot; According to Scherer, Nydahl presents himself as a lay-siddhi yogi, with a &quot;polarizing style&quot;. The yogi-lay element is presented by Nydahl as a legitimization of his position as a teacher within the Karma Kagyu, and &quot;addresses Nydahl&#x27;s unconventional spiritual formation and education outside the prescribed curriculum of three-year retreats.&quot;

Scherer further notes that Nydahls&#x27; unconventional role as a siddhi-yogi, and his presentation of Mahamudra-teachings outside &quot;the gradual Tantric trajectory&quot;, has historical precedents in the crazy yogis who established Tibetan Buddhism. These precedents are relevant in understanding Nydahl&#x27;s role as a yogic/lay teacher. Lama Ole&#x27;s first teacher, Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche, interpreted Nydahl&#x27;s activity within the context of the Mahāsiddha tradition and the yogi/accomplisher way, stating, &quot;Almost all of the 84 Mahasiddhas followed the lay way, only a few of them were monks and nuns. Nowadays, the lay way is natural and beneficial for many people.&quot;

===Westernization and neo-orthopraxy===
According to Borup, &quot;[Nydahl] and his Diamond Way Buddhism is in no way representative of Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism or the teachings of the Karma Kagyu lineage.&quot; Martin Baumann, a professor of religion at the University of Lucerne, remarked in a newspaper interview &quot;when I listen to his [Nydahl&#x27;s] alarmingly superficial formulations in his talks I can understand his critics who say that he is presenting a watered-down &#x27;instant Buddhism&#x27;, a sort of &#x27;Buddhism light&#x27; for the West.&quot;

In a 2009 article, Bee Scherer, a professor of gender studies and religious studies at Canterbury Christ Church University and a student of Thaye Dorje, as well as a former student of Ole Nydahl, examined if these criticisms apply to the core rituals and practices performed in the &quot;Diamond Way&quot;. Scherer describes a number of practices, some of which have been partly adapted to the west, while others are fully in line with traditional Karma Kagyu practices, concluding that Baumann&#x27;s critique applies only partly. According to Scherer, Nydahl&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Way&quot; practices can best be described as a &quot;neo-orthopraxy&quot;, a new, westernized form of traditional practices. He regrets that Nydahl&#x27;s ideas are not discussed by Tibet scholars, and opines that they have a duty to counterbalance the prevailing negative criticism by sociologists and students of New Religious Movements.

===Role in the Karmapa controversy===
When a great Tibetan lama dies, it is tradition in Tibetan Buddhism to find the next reincarnation to continue the work. When Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the Sixteenth Karmapa (head of the Karma Kagyu) died in 1981, two potential successors were found, Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje, causing a major split in the Karma Kagyu. Because Shamar Rinpoche was one of Hannah and Ole Nydahl&#x27;s main teachers, they supported his recognition of Trinley Thaye Dorje as the 17th Karmapa.

Geoffrey Samuel, an academic expert in the field testified in court, while the recognition of Ogyen Trinley &quot;appears to have been accepted by a majority of Karma Kagyu monasteries and lamas, there remains a substantial minority of monasteries and lamas who have not accepted Ogyen Trinley as Karmapa. In particular, these include the Shamar Rinpoche, who historically has been the person most directly involved in the process of recognition.&quot;

It was largely because of the work of Hannah and Ole Nydahl that most European Karma Kagyu centers chose to support Trinley Thaye Dorje. As a result, Trinley Thaye Dorje is the &quot;patron&quot; of the centers of the Diamond Way Buddhism.

Due to his role in the Karmapa controversy, Nydahl has been heavily criticized by the supporters of Ogyen Trinley Dorje, such as the authors Mick Brown and Lea Terhune, a student of Tai Situpa. In connection to this, some blame Nydahl for causing the 1992 split of the Karma Kagyu, and accuse him of breaking the samayas to his teachers, which is deprecated in Vajrayana.

=== Political views ===
Some members of the press have criticized Nydahl&#x27;s version of Diamond Way Buddhism, describing it as featuring &quot;prevalent militaristic appearances, right-wing political views and fierce anti-Islam rhetoric&quot;. Others have more positive views of Nydahl&#x27;s work, describing his dedication to his work and patriotism. Scherer describes Nydahl&#x27;s representation of himself as &quot;a Buddhist teacher and protector of Western freedom&quot;. This addresses his legitimization narrative of himself as emanation of a Buddhist protector and his Kālacakra-linked fierce interpretation of Islam in particular as a key threat to Western freedom and human, especially women&#x27;s rights. Nydahl has referred to the Islamic religion as &quot;criminal&quot;, has called Allah a &quot;terrible god&quot;, and has characterized Muslim beliefs as antithetical to freedom of speech and women&#x27;s rights:

Nydahl says that he does not make political comments in his capacity as a lama, but as a &quot;responsible, thinking human being&quot;, and that no one can make such statements from a Buddhist perspective because Buddha Shakyamuni did not comment on religious ideas founded centuries after his death.

An online interview with Nydahl also featured the following statement: &quot;Judaism and Christianity are fine. Islam, I warn against. I know the Koran, I know the life story of Mohammad and I think we cannot use that in our society today.&quot;

=== Dispute with German Buddhist Union ===
Between late 1999 and April 2000 there was a public dispute between the German Buddhist Union and the German branch of Diamond Way, which was a member organisation of the Union. Due to Nydahl&#x27;s disparaging attitude towards Islam, his political statements, his manner of expressing and presenting himself, and his relationships with women, there were calls for the expulsion of Nydahl&#x27;s organisation from the Union. The dispute was resolved at a meeting between the two organizations on 4 October 2000; although differences were clear, they agreed to learn from the past and cooperate in the future. The conversation was described as &quot;a first step&quot; that &quot;should eliminate misunderstandings, and lead to clarity and cooperation&quot;. The German branch of Diamond Way &quot;(Buddhistischer Dachverband Diamantweg)&quot; remained a member of the German Buddhist Union.
In 2019 there were discussions and an application to exclude the Diamond Way from the German Buddhist Union (DBU), based on Nydahl&#x27;s statements about Islam. DBU members were worried about possible damage to reputation and the German section of Diamond Way decided to leave the DBU.

==Personal life==
Ole Nydahl met his future wife Hannah when he was 10 and she was five. They met again just after Nydhal came out of the army. Hannah Nydahl died of lung cancer in 2007.

In 2014 Nydahl married Alexandra Munoz Barbosa at the Copenhagen Diamond Way Buddhist center. In 2017 they were divorced.

On 31 August 2019 Ole Nydahl and Anne Behrend were married at the Diamond Way Buddhist center in Těnovice, Czech Republic.

In an interview in 2017 Ole Nydahl mentioned he had fathered two children.

On 18 December 2020 Ole Nydahl and Anne Behrend welcomed the birth of their daughter Freya.

<text>Ha-Mim () is the short form of the name Ha-Mim ibn Mann-Allah ibn Harir ibn Umar ibn Rahfu ibn Azerwal ibn Majkasa (), also known as Abu Muhammad; he was a member of the Majkasa sub-tribe of the Ghomara Berbers who proclaimed himself a prophet in 925 near Tetouan in Morocco. He was named after a well-known combination of Qur&#x27;anic initial letters.

His claim was widely accepted among the Ghomara of the time, and he established rules for them. He said that he received a revelation in the Berber language, portions of which historian Ibn Khaldun quotes in Arabic: &quot;O You who are beyond sight, who watches the world, release me from my sins! O You who saved Moses from the sea, You believe in Ha-Mim and in his father Abu-Khalaf Mann Allah...&quot;

He died in 927 fighting the Masmuda Berbers near Tangier, and was succeeded politically by his son Isa, who sent an embassy to the Umayyad Caliph Abd-ar-rahman III an-Nasir. His religion&#x27;s later history is unclear, but it vanished well before even Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s time.

<text>Aeolian processes, also spelled eolian, pertain to wind activity in the study of geology and weather and specifically to the wind&#x27;s ability to shape the surface of the Earth (or other planets). Winds may erode, transport, and deposit materials. They are effective agents in regions with sparse vegetation, a lack of soil moisture and a large supply of unconsolidated sediments. Although water is a much more powerful eroding force than wind, aeolian processes are important in arid environments such as deserts.

The term is derived from the name of the Greek god Aeolus, the keeper of the winds.

==Definition and setting==
&quot;Aeolian processes&quot; are those processes of erosion, transport, and deposition of sediments that are caused by wind at or near the surface of the earth. Sediment deposits produced by the action of wind and the sedimentary structures characteristic of these deposits are also described as &quot;aeolian&quot;.

Aeolian processes are most important in areas where there is little or no vegetation. However, aeolian deposits are not restricted to arid climates. They are also seen along shorelines; along stream courses in semiarid climates; in areas of ample sand weathered from weakly cemented sandstone outcrops; and in areas of glacial outwash.

Loess, which is silt deposited by wind, is common in humid to subhumid climates. Much of North America and Europe are underlain by sand and loess of Pleistocene age originating from glacial outwash.

The lee (downwind) side of river valleys in semiarid regions are often blanketed with sand and sand dunes. Examples in North America include the Platte, Arkansas, and Missouri Rivers.

==Wind erosion==

Wind erodes the Earth&#x27;s surface by &quot;deflation&quot; (the removal of loose, fine-grained particles by the turbulent action of the wind) and by &quot;abrasion&quot; (the wearing down of surfaces by the grinding action and sandblasting by windborne particles). Once entrained in the wind, collisions between particles further break them down, a process called &quot;attrition&quot;.

Worldwide, erosion by water is more important than erosion by wind, but wind erosion is important in semiarid and arid regions. Wind erosion is increased by some human activities, such as the use of 4x4 vehicles.

===Deflation===
Deflation is the lifting and removal of loose material from the surface by wind turbulence. It takes place by three mechanisms: traction/surface creep, saltation, and suspension. Traction or surface creep is a process of larger grains sliding or rolling across the surface. Saltation refers to particles bouncing across the surface for short distances. Suspended particles are fully entrained in the wind, which carries them for long distances. Saltation likely accounts for 50–70 % of deflation, while suspension accounts for 30–40 % and surface creep accounts for 5–25 %.

Regions which experience intense and sustained erosion are called deflation zones. Most aeolian deflation zones are composed of desert pavement, a sheet-like surface of rock fragments that remains after wind and water have removed the fine particles. The rock mantle in desert pavements protects the underlying material from further deflation. Areas of desert pavement form the &quot;regs&quot; or stony deserts of the Sahara. These are further divided into rocky areas called &quot;hamadas&quot; and areas of small rocks and gravel called &quot;serirs&quot;. Desert pavement is extremely common in desert environments.

Blowouts are hollows formed by wind deflation. Blowouts are generally small, but may be up to several kilometers in diameter. The smallest are mere dimples deep and in diameter. The largest include the blowout hollows of Mongolia, which can be across and deep. Big Hollow in Wyoming, US, extends and is up to deep.

===Abrasion===

Abrasion (also sometimes called &quot;corrasion&quot;) is the process of wind-driven grains knocking or wearing material off of landforms. It was once considered a major contributor to desert erosion, but by the mid-20th Century, it had come to be considered much less important. Wind can normally lift sand only a short distance, with most windborne sand remaining within of the surface and practically none normally being carried above . Many desert features once attributed to wind abrasion, including wind caves, mushroom rocks, and the honeycomb weathering called tafoni, are now attributed to differential weathering, rainwash, deflation rather than abrasion, or other processes.

&quot;Yardangs&quot; are one kind of desert feature that is widely attributed to wind abrasion. These are rock ridges, up to tens of meters high and kilometers long, that have been streamlined by desert winds. Yardangs characteristically show elongated furrows or grooves aligned with the prevailing wind. They form mostly in softer material such as silts.

Abrasion produces polishing and pitting, grooving, shaping, and faceting of exposed surfaces. These are widespread in arid environments but geologically insignificant. Polished or faceted surfaces called &quot;ventifacts&quot; are rare, requiring abundant sand, powerful winds, and a lack of vegetation for their formation.

In parts of Antarctica wind-blown snowflakes that are technically sediments have also caused abrasion of exposed rocks.

===Attrition===
Attrition is the wearing down by collisions of particles entrained in a moving fluid. It is effective at rounding sand grains and at giving them a distinctive &quot;frosted&quot; surface texture.

Collisions between windborne particles is a major source of dust in the size range of 2-5 microns. Most of this is produced by the removal of a weathered clay coating from the grains.

==Transport==

Wind dominates the transport of sand and finer sediments in arid environments. Wind transport is also important in periglacial areas, on river flood plains, and in coastal areas. Coastal winds transport significant amounts of siliciclastic and carbonate sediments inland, while wind storms and dust storms can carry clay and silt particles great distances. Wind transports much of the sediments deposited in deep ocean basins. In &quot;ergs&quot; (desert sand seas), wind is very effective at transporting grains of sand size and smaller.

Particles are transported by winds through suspension, saltation (skipping or bouncing) and creeping (rolling or sliding) along the ground. The minimum wind velocity to initiate transport is called the &quot;fluid threshold&quot; or &quot;static threshold&quot; and is the wind velocity required to begin dislodging grains from the surface. Once transport is initiated, there is a cascade effect from grains tearing loose other grains, so that transport continues until the wind velocity drops below the &quot;dynamic threshold&quot; or &quot;impact threshold&quot;, which is usually less than the fluid threshold. In other words, there is hysteresis in the wind transport system.

Small particles may be held in the atmosphere in suspension. Turbulent air motion supports the weight of suspended particles and allows them to be transported for great distances. Wind is particularly effective at separating sediment grains under 0.05 mm in size from coarser grains as suspended particles.

Saltation is downwind movement of particles in a series of jumps or skips. Saltation is most important for grains of up to 2 mm in size. A saltating grain may hit other grains that jump up to continue the saltation. The grain may also hit larger grains (over 2 mm in size) that are too heavy to hop, but that slowly creep forward as they are pushed by saltating grains. Surface creep accounts for as much as 25 percent of grain movement in a desert.

Vegetation is effective at suppressing aeolian transport. Vegetation cover of as little as 15% is sufficient to eliminate most sand transport. The size of shore dunes is limited mostly by the amount of open space between vegetated areas.

Aeolian transport from deserts plays an important role in ecosystems globally. For example, wind transports minerals from the Sahara to the Amazon basin. Saharan dust is also responsible for forming red clay soils in southern Europe.

===Dust storms===

Dust storms are wind storms that have entrained enough dust to reduce visibility to less than . Most occur on the synoptic (regional) scale, due to strong winds along weather fronts, or locally from downbursts from thunderstorms.

Crops, people, and possibly even climates are affected by dust storms. On Earth, dust can cross entire oceans, as occurs with dust from the Sahara that reaches the Amazon Basin. Dust storms on Mars periodically engulf the entire planet. When the Mariner 9 spacecraft entered its orbit around Mars in 1971, a dust storm lasting one month covered the entire planet, thus delaying the task of photo-mapping the planet&#x27;s surface.

Most of the dust carried by dust storms is in the form of silt-size particles. Deposits of this windblown silt are known as loess. The thickest known deposit of loess, up to , is on the Loess Plateau in China. This very same Asian dust is blown for thousands of miles, forming deep beds in places as far away as Hawaii. The Peoria Loess of North America is up to thick in parts of western Iowa. The soils developed on loess are generally highly productive for agriculture.

Small whirlwinds, called dust devils, are common in arid lands and are thought to be related to very intense local heating of the air that results in instabilities of the air mass. Dust devils may be as much as one kilometer high. Dust devils on Mars have been observed as high as , though this is uncommon.

==Deposition==


Wind is very effective at separating sand from silt and clay. As a result, there are distinct sandy (erg) and silty (loess) aeolian deposits, with only limited interbedding between the two. Loess deposits are found further from the original source of sediments than ergs. An example of this is the Sand Hills of Nebraska, US. Here vegetation-stabilized sand dunes are found to the west and loess deposits to the east, further from the original sediment source in the Ogallala Formation at the feet of the Rocky Mountains.

Some of the most significant experimental measurements on aeolian landforms were performed by Ralph Alger Bagnold, a British army engineer who worked in Egypt prior to World War II. Bagnold investigated the physics of particles moving through the atmosphere and deposited by wind. He recognized two basic dune types, the crescentic dune, which he called &quot;barchan&quot;, and the linear dune, which he called longitudinal or &quot;seif&quot; (Arabic for &quot;sword&quot;). Bagnold developed a classification scheme that included small-scale ripples and sand sheets as well as various types of dunes.

Bagnold&#x27;s classification is most applicable in areas devoid of vegetation. In 1941, John Tilton Hack added parabolic dunes, which are strongly influenced by vegetation, to the list of dune types. The discovery of dunes on Mars reinvigorated aeolian process research, which increasingly makes use of computer simulation.

Wind-deposited materials hold clues to past as well as to present wind directions and intensities. These features help us understand the present climate and the forces that molded it. For example, vast inactive ergs in much of the modern world attest to late Pleistocene trade wind belts being much expanded during the Last Glacial Maximum. Ice cores show a tenfold increase in non-volcanic dust during glacial maxima. The highest dust peak in the Vostok ice cores dates to 20 to 21 thousand years ago. The abundant dust is attributed to a vigorous low-latitude wind system plus more exposed continental shelf due to low sea levels.

Wind-deposited sand bodies occur as ripples and other small-scale features, sand sheets, and dunes.

===Ripples and other small-scale features===

Wind blowing on a sand surface ripples the surface into crests and troughs whose long axes are perpendicular to the wind direction. The average length of jumps during saltation corresponds to the wavelength, or distance between adjacent crests, of the ripples. In ripples, the coarsest materials collect at the crests causing inverse grading. This distinguishes small ripples from dunes, where the coarsest materials are generally in the troughs. This is also a distinguishing feature between water laid ripples and aeolian ripples.

A &quot;sand shadow&quot; is an accumulation of sand on the downwind side of an obstruction, such as a boulder or an isolated patch of vegetation. Here the sand builds up to the angle of repose (the maximum stable slope angle), about 34 degrees, then begins sliding down the &quot;slip face&quot; of the patch. A &quot;sandfall&quot; is a sand shadow of a cliff or escarpment.

Closely related to sand shadows are &quot;sand drifts&quot;. These form downwind of a gap between obstructions, due to the funneling effect of the obstructions on the wind.

===Sand sheets===

Sand sheets are flat or gently undulating sandy deposits with only small surface ripples. An example is the Selima Sand Sheet in the eastern Sahara Desert, which occupies in southern Egypt and northern Sudan. This consists of a few feet of sand resting on bedrock. Sand sheets are often remarkably flat and are sometimes described as &quot;desert peneplains&quot;.

Sand sheets are common in desert environments, particularly on the margins of dune fields, although they also occur within ergs. Conditions that favor the formation of sand sheets, instead of dunes, may include surface cementation, a high water table, the effects of vegetation, periodic flooding, or sediments rich in grains too coarse for effective saltation.

===Dunes===
A dune is an accumulations of sediment blown by the wind into a mound or ridge. They differ from sand shadows or sand drifts in that they are independent of any topographic obstacle. Dunes have gentle upwind slopes on the windward side. The downwind portion of the dune, the lee slope, is commonly a steep avalanche slope referred to as a slipface. Dunes may have more than one slipface. The minimum height of a slipface is about 30 centimeters.

Wind-blown sand moves up the gentle upwind side of the dune by saltation or creep. Sand accumulates at the brink, the top of the slipface. When the buildup of sand at the brink exceeds the angle of repose, a small avalanche of grains slides down the slipface. Grain by grain, the dune moves downwind.

Dunes take three general forms. Linear dunes, also called longitudinal dunes or seifs, are aligned in the direction of the prevailing winds. Transverse dunes, which include crescent dunes (barchans), are aligned perpendicular to the prevailing winds. More complex dunes, such as star dunes, form where the directions of the winds are highly variable. Additional dune types arise from various kinds of topographic forcing, such as from isolated hills or escarpments.

====Transverse dunes====

Transverse dunes occur in areas dominated by a single direction of the prevailing wind. In areas where sand is not abundant, transverse dunes take the form of barchans or crescent dunes. These are not common, but they are highly recognizable, with a distinctive crescent shape with the tips of the crescent directed downwind. The dunes are widely separated by areas of bedrock or reg. Barchans migrate up to per year, with the taller dunes migrating faster. Barchans first form when some minor topographic feature creates a sand patch. This grows into a sand mound, and the converging streamlines of the air flow around the mound build it into the distinctive crescent shape. Growth is ultimately limited by the carrying capacity of the wind, which as the wind becomes saturated with sediments, builds up the slip face of the dune. Because barchans develop in areas of limited sand availability, they are poorly preserved in the geologic record.

Where sand is more abundant, transverse dunes take the form of aklé dunes, such as those of the western Sahara. These form a network of sinuous ridges perpendicular to the wind direction. Aklé dunes are preserved in the geologic record as sandstone with large sets of cross-bedding and many reactivation surfaces.

Draas are very large composite transverse dunes. They can be up to across and high and extend lengthwise for hundreds of kilometers. In form, they resemble a large aklé or barchanoid dune. They form over a prolonged period of time in areas of abundant sand and show a complex internal structure. Careful 3-D mapping is required to determine the morphology of a draa preserved in the geologic record.

====Linear dunes====

Linear dunes can be traced up to tens of kilometers, with heights sometimes in excess of . They are typically several hundred meters across and are spaced apart. They sometimes coalesce at a Y-junction with the fork directed upwind. They have a sharp sinuous or en echelon crest. They are thought to form from a bimodal seasonal wind pattern, with a weak wind season characterized by wind directed an at acute angle to the prevailing winds of the strong wind season. The strong wind season produces a barchan form and the weak wind season stretches this into the linear form. Another possibility is that these dunes result from secondary flow, though the precise mechanism remains uncertain.

====Complex dunes====
Complex dunes (star dunes or rhourd dunes) are characterized by having more than two slip faces. They are typically across and high. They consist of a central peak with radiating crests and are thought to form where strong winds can come from any direction. Those in Gran Desierto de Altar of Mexico are thought to have formed from precursor linear dunes due to a change in the wind pattern about 3000 years ago. Complex dunes show Little lateral growth but strong vertical growth and are important sand sinks.

====Other dune types====
Vegetated parabolic dunes are crescent-shaped, but the ends of the crescent point upwind, not downwind. They form from the interaction of vegetation patches with active sand sources, such as blowouts. The vegetation stabilizes the arms of the dune, and an elongated lake sometimes forms between the arms of the dune.

Clay dunes are uncommon but have been found in Africa, Australia, and along the Gulf Coast of North America. These form on mud flats on the margins of saline bodies of water subject to strong prevailing winds during a dry season. Clay particles are bound into sand-sized pellets by salts and are then deposited in the dunes, where the return of the cool season allows the pellets to absorb moisture and become bound to the dune surface.

==Aeolian desert systems==

Deserts cover 20 to 25 percent of the modern land surface of the earth, mostly between the latitudes of 10 to 30 degrees north or south. Here the descending part of the tropical atmospheric circulation (the Hadley cell) produces high atmospheric pressure and suppresses precipitation. Large areas of this desert is floored with windblown sand. Such areas are called &quot;ergs&quot; when they exceed about in area or &quot;dune fields&quot; when smaller. Ergs and dune fields make up about 20% of modern deserts or about 6% of the Earth&#x27;s total land surface.

The sandy areas of today&#x27;s world are somewhat anomalous. Deserts, in both the present day and in the geological record, are usually dominated by alluvial fans rather than dune fields. The present relative abundance of sandy areas may reflect reworking of Tertiary sediments following the Last Glacial Maximum. Most modern deserts have experienced extreme Quaternary climate change, and the sediments that are now being churned by wind systems were generated in upland areas during previous pluvial (moist) periods and transported to depositional basins by stream flow. The sediments, already sorted during their initial fluvial transport, were further sorted by wind, which also sculpted the sediments into eolian landforms.

The state of an aeolian system depends mainly on three things: The amount of sediment supply, the availability of sediments, and the transport capacity of the winds. The sediment supply is largely produced in pluvial periods (periods of greater rainfall) and accumulates by runoff as fan deltas or terminal fans in sedimentary basins. Another important source of sediments is the reworking of carbonate sediments on continental shelves exposed during times of lower sea level. Sediment availability depends on the coarseness of the local sediment supply, the degree of exposure of sediment grains, the amount of soil moisture, and the extent of vegetation coverage. The potential transport rate of wind is usually more than the actual transport, because the sediment supply is usually insufficient to saturate the wind. In other words, most aeolian systems are &quot;transport-undersaturated&quot; (or &quot;sediment-undersaturated&quot;).

Aeolian desert systems can be divided into wet, dry, or stabilized systems. Dry systems have the water table well below the surface, where it has no stabilizing effect on sediments. Dune shapes determine whether sediment is deposited, simply moves across surface (a &quot;bypass&quot; system), or erosion takes place. Wet systems are characterized by a water table near the depositional surface, which exerts a strong control on deposition, bypass, or erosion. Stabilized systems have significant vegetation, surface cement, or mud drapes which dominate the evolution of the system. The Sahara shows the full range of all three types.

The movement of sediments in aeolian systems can be represented by sand-flow maps. These are based on meteorological observations, bedform orientations, and trends of yardangs. They are analogous to drainage maps, but are not as closely tied to topography, since wind can blow sand significant distances uphill.

The Sahara of North Africa is the largest hot desert in the world. Flowlines can be traced from erg to erg, demonstrating very long transport downwind. Satellite observations show yardangs aligned with the sandflow lines. All flowlines arise in the desert itself, and show indications of clockwise circulation roughly like high pressure cells. The greatest deflation occurs in dried lake beds where trade winds form a low-level jet between the Tibesti Mountains and the Ennedi Plateau. The flowlines eventually reach the, sea creating great plume of Saharan dust extending thousands of kilometers into the Atlantic Ocean. This creates a steady rain of silt into the ocean. It is estimated that 260 million tons of sediments are transported through this system each year, but the amount was much greater during the Last Glacial Maximum, based on deep-sea cores. Mineral dust of 0.1–1 microns in size is a good shortwave radiation scatterer and has a cooling effect on climate.

Another example of an aeolian system is the arid interior of Australia. With few topographic barriers to sand movement, an anticlockwise wind system is traced by systems of longitudinal dunes.

The Namib and Oman ergs are fed by coastal sediments. The Namib receives its sediments from the south through narrow deflation corridors from coast that cross more than of bedrock to the erg. The Oman was created by deflation of marine shelf carbonates during the last Pleistocene lowstand of the sea.

The Loess Plateau of China has been a long-term sink for sediments during the Quaternary ice age. It provides a record of glaciation, in the form of glacial loess layers separated by paleosols (fossil soils). The loess layers were desposited by a strong northwest winter monsoon, while the paleosols record the influence of a moist southeast monsoon.

The African savannah is mostly ergs deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum that are now stabilized by vegetation.

===Examples===
Major global aeolian systems thought to be linked with weather and climate variation:

* An average of 132 million tons of dust from the Sahara (primarily the Sahel and Bodélé Depression) across the Atlantic each year. 
* Harmattan winter dust storms in West Africa also occur blowing dust to the ocean.
* Asian dust originates in the Gobi Desert and reaches Korea, Japan, Taiwan (at times) and even the western US.
* The 2018 Indian dust storms transported dust from the Thar Desert towards Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
* Shamal June–July winds blowing dust in primarily north to south in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, UAE, and parts of Pakistan.
* Haboob dust storms in Sudan, Australia, Arizona associated with monsoon.
* Khamsin dust from Libya, Egypt and Levant in Spring associated with extratropical cyclones.
* Dust Bowl event in US, carried sand eastward. 5500 tons were deposited in Chicago area.
* Sirocco sandy winds from Africa/Sahara blowing north into South Europe.
* Kalahari Desert blowing sand/dust east across southern Africa toward Indian Ocean.
* Mars in the arid conditions, many aeolian processes have been discovered.

===In the geologic record===

Aeolian processes can be discerned at work in the geologic record as long ago as the Precambrian. Aeolian formations are prominent in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic of the western US. Other examples include the Permian Rotliegendes of northwestern Europe; the Jurassic–Cretaceous Botucatu Formation of the Parana Basin of Brazil; the Permian Lower Bunter Sandstone of Britain; the Permian-Triassic Corrie Sandstone and Hopeman Sandstone of Scotland; and the Proterozoic sandstones of India and northwest Africa.

Perhaps the best examples of aeolian processes in the geologic record are the Jurassic ergs of the western US. These include the Wingate Sandstone, the Navajo Sandstone, and the Page Sandstone. Individual formations are separated by regional unconformities indicate erg stabilization. The ergs interfingered with adjacent river systems, as with the Wingate Sandstone interfingering with the Moenave Formation and the Navajo Sandstone with the Kayenta Formation.

The Navajo and Nugget Sandstones were part of the largest erg deposit in the geologic record. These formations are up to thick and are exposed over . Their original extent was likely 2.5 times the present outcrop area. Though once thought to possibly be marine in origin, they are now all but universally regarded as aeolian deposits. They are made up mostly of fine- to medium-sized quartz grains that are well-rounded and frosted, both indications of aeolian transport. The Navajo contains huge tabular crossbed sets with sweeping foresets. Individual crossbed sets dip at an angle of more than 20 degrees and are from thick. The formation contains freshwater invertebrate fossils and vertebrate tracks. Slump structures (contorted bedding) are present that resemble those in modern wetted dunes. Successive migrating dunes deposited a vertical stacking of eolian beds between interdune bounding surfaces and regional supersurfaces. 

The Permian Rotliegend Group of the North Sea and north Europe contains sediments from adjacent uplands. Erg sand bodies within the group are up to thick. Study of the crossbedding shows that sediments were deposited by a clockwise atmospheric cell. Drilling core show dry and wet interdune surfaces and regional supersurfaces, and provide evidence of five or more cycles of erg expansion and contraction. A global rise in sea level finally drowned the erg and deposited the beds of the Weissliegend.

The Cedar Mesa Sandstone in Utah was contemporary with the Rogliegend. This formation records at least 12 erg sequences bounded by regional deflation supersurfaces. Aeolian landforms preserved in the formation range from damp sandsheet and lake paleosol (fossil soil) beds to thin, chaotically arranged dune sets to equilibrium erg construction, with dunes wide migrating over still larger draas. The draas survived individual climate cycles, and their interdunes were sites of barchan nucleation during arid portions of the climate cycles.

<text>In mathematics, nonstandard calculus is the modern application of infinitesimals, in the sense of nonstandard analysis, to infinitesimal calculus. It provides a rigorous justification for some arguments in calculus that were previously considered merely heuristic.

Non-rigorous calculations with infinitesimals were widely used before Karl Weierstrass sought to replace them with the (ε, δ)-definition of limit starting in the 1870s. For almost one hundred years thereafter, mathematicians such as Richard Courant viewed infinitesimals as being naive and vague or meaningless. 

Contrary to such views, Abraham Robinson showed in 1960 that infinitesimals are precise, clear, and meaningful, building upon work by Edwin Hewitt and Jerzy Łoś. According to Howard Keisler, &quot;Robinson solved a three hundred year old problem by giving a precise treatment of infinitesimals. Robinson&#x27;s achievement will probably rank as one of the major mathematical advances of the twentieth century.&quot;

== History ==
The history of nonstandard calculus began with the use of infinitely small quantities, called infinitesimals in calculus. The use of infinitesimals can be found in the foundations of calculus independently developed by Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton starting in the 1660s. John Wallis refined earlier techniques of indivisibles of Cavalieri and others by exploiting an infinitesimal quantity he denoted formula_1 in area calculations, preparing the ground for integral calculus. They drew on the work of such mathematicians as Pierre de Fermat, Isaac Barrow and René Descartes.

In early calculus the use of infinitesimal quantities was criticized by a number of authors, most notably Michel Rolle and Bishop Berkeley in his book &quot;The Analyst&quot;.

Several mathematicians, including Maclaurin and d&#x27;Alembert, advocated the use of limits. Augustin Louis Cauchy developed a versatile spectrum of foundational approaches, including a definition of continuity in terms of infinitesimals and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an ε, δ argument in working with differentiation. Karl Weierstrass formalized the concept of limit in the context of a (real) number system without infinitesimals. Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on ε, δ arguments instead of infinitesimals.

This approach formalized by Weierstrass came to be known as the &quot;standard&quot; calculus. After many years of the infinitesimal approach to calculus having fallen into disuse other than as an introductory pedagogical tool, use of infinitesimal quantities was finally given a rigorous foundation by Abraham Robinson in the 1960s. Robinson&#x27;s approach is called nonstandard analysis to distinguish it from the standard use of limits. This approach used technical machinery from mathematical logic to create a theory of hyperreal numbers that interpret infinitesimals in a manner that allows a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. An alternative approach, developed by Edward Nelson, finds infinitesimals on the ordinary real line itself, and involves a modification of the foundational setting by extending ZFC through the introduction of a new unary predicate &quot;standard&quot;.

==Motivation==

To calculate the derivative formula_2 of the function formula_3 at &quot;x&quot;, both approaches agree on the algebraic manipulations:

: formula_4

This becomes a computation of the derivatives using the hyperreals if formula_5 is interpreted as an infinitesimal and the symbol &quot;formula_6&quot; is the relation &quot;is infinitely close to&quot;.

In order to make &quot;f &quot;&#x27; a real-valued function, the final term formula_5 is dispensed with. In the standard approach using only real numbers, that is done by taking the limit as formula_5 tends to zero. In the hyperreal approach, the quantity formula_5 is taken to be an infinitesimal, a nonzero number that is closer to 0 than to any nonzero real. The manipulations displayed above then show that formula_10 is infinitely close to 2&quot;x&quot;, so the derivative of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;x&quot; is then 2&quot;x&quot;.

Discarding the &quot;error term&quot; is accomplished by an application of the standard part function. Dispensing with infinitesimal error terms was historically considered paradoxical by some writers, most notably George Berkeley.

Once the hyperreal number system (an infinitesimal-enriched continuum) is in place, one has successfully incorporated a large part of the technical difficulties at the foundational level. Thus, the epsilon, delta techniques that some believe to be the essence of analysis can be implemented once and for all at the foundational level, and the students needn&#x27;t be &quot;dressed to perform multiple-quantifier logical stunts on pretense of being taught infinitesimal calculus&quot;, to quote a recent study. More specifically, the basic concepts of calculus such as continuity, derivative, and integral can be defined using infinitesimals without reference to epsilon, delta.

==Keisler&#x27;s textbook==
Keisler&#x27;s Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach defines continuity on page 125 in terms of infinitesimals, to the exclusion of epsilon, delta methods.
The derivative is defined on page 45 using infinitesimals rather than an epsilon-delta approach.
The integral is defined on page 183 in terms of infinitesimals.
Epsilon, delta definitions are introduced on page 282.

==Definition of derivative==

The hyperreals can be constructed in the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the standard axiomatisation of set theory used elsewhere in mathematics. To give an intuitive idea for the hyperreal approach, note that, naively speaking, nonstandard analysis postulates the existence of positive numbers ε &quot;which are infinitely small&quot;, meaning that ε is smaller than any standard positive real, yet greater than zero. Every real number &quot;x&quot; is surrounded by an infinitesimal &quot;cloud&quot; of hyperreal numbers infinitely close to it. To define the derivative of &quot;f&quot; at a standard real number &quot;x&quot; in this approach, one no longer needs an infinite limiting process as in standard calculus. Instead, one sets

:formula_11

where st is the standard part function, yielding the real number infinitely close to the hyperreal argument of st, and formula_12 is the natural extension of formula_13 to the hyperreals.

==Continuity==
A real function &quot;f&quot; is continuous at a standard real number &quot;x&quot; if for every hyperreal &quot;x&#x27; &quot; infinitely close to &quot;x&quot;, the value &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&#x27; &quot;) is also infinitely close to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). This captures Cauchy&#x27;s definition of continuity as presented in his 1821 textbook Cours d&#x27;Analyse, p. 34.

Here to be precise, &quot;f&quot; would have to be replaced by its natural hyperreal extension usually denoted &quot;f&quot;*.

Using the notation formula_6 for the relation of being infinitely close as above,
the definition can be extended to arbitrary (standard or nonstandard) points as follows:

A function &quot;f&quot; is &quot;microcontinuous&quot; at &quot;x&quot; if whenever formula_15, one has formula_16

Here the point x&#x27; is assumed to be in the domain of (the natural extension of) &quot;f&quot;.

The above requires fewer quantifiers than the (&quot;ε&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;)-definition familiar from standard elementary calculus:

&quot;f&quot; is continuous at &quot;x&quot; if for every &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0, there exists a &quot;δ&quot; &gt; 0 such that for every &quot;x&#x27; &quot;, whenever |&quot;x&quot; − &quot;x&#x27; &quot;| &lt; &quot;δ&quot;, one has |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&#x27; &quot;)| &lt; &quot;ε&quot;.

==Uniform continuity==
A function &quot;f&quot; on an interval &quot;I&quot; is uniformly continuous if its natural extension &quot;f&quot;* in &quot;I&quot;* has the following property:

for every pair of hyperreals &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;I&quot;*, if formula_17 then formula_18.

In terms of microcontinuity defined in the previous section, this can be stated as follows: a real function is uniformly continuous if its natural extension f* is microcontinuous at every point of the domain of f*.

This definition has a reduced quantifier complexity when compared with the standard (ε, δ)-definition. Namely, the epsilon-delta definition of uniform continuity requires four quantifiers, while the infinitesimal definition requires only two quantifiers. It has the same quantifier complexity as the definition of uniform continuity in terms of &quot;sequences&quot; in standard calculus, which however is not expressible in the first-order language of the real numbers.

The hyperreal definition can be illustrated by the following three examples.

Example 1: a function &quot;f&quot; is uniformly continuous on the semi-open interval (0,1], if and only if its natural extension f* is microcontinuous (in the sense of the formula above) at every positive infinitesimal, in addition to continuity at the standard points of the interval.

Example 2: a function &quot;f&quot; is uniformly continuous on the semi-open interval [0,∞) if and only if it is continuous at the standard points of the interval, and in addition, the natural extension &quot;f&quot;* is microcontinuous at every positive infinite hyperreal point.

Example 3: similarly, the failure of uniform continuity for the squaring function

:formula_19

is due to the absence of microcontinuity at a single infinite hyperreal point.

Concerning quantifier complexity, the following remarks were made by Kevin Houston:

:The number of quantifiers in a mathematical statement gives a rough measure of the statement’s complexity. Statements involving three or more quantifiers can be difficult to understand. This is the main reason why it is hard to understand the rigorous definitions of limit, convergence, continuity and differentiability in analysis as they have many quantifiers. In fact, it is the alternation of the formula_20 and formula_21 that causes the complexity.

Andreas Blass wrote as follows:
:Often ... the nonstandard definition of a concept is simpler than the standard definition (both intuitively simpler and simpler in a technical sense, such as quantifiers over lower types or fewer alternations of quantifiers).

==Compactness==

A set A is compact if and only if its natural extension A* has the following property: every point in A* is infinitely close to a point of A. Thus, the open interval (0,1) is not compact because its natural extension contains positive infinitesimals which are not infinitely close to any positive real number.

==Heine–Cantor theorem==
The fact that a continuous function on a compact interval &quot;I&quot; is necessarily uniformly continuous (the Heine–Cantor theorem) admits a succinct hyperreal proof. Let &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; be hyperreals in the natural extension &quot;I*&quot; of &quot;I&quot;. Since &quot;I&quot; is compact, both st(&quot;x&quot;) and st(&quot;y&quot;) belong to &quot;I&quot;. If &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; were infinitely close, then by the triangle inequality, they would have the same standard part

:formula_22

Since the function is assumed continuous at c,

:formula_23

and therefore &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) are infinitely close, proving uniform continuity of &quot;f&quot;.

==Why is the squaring function not uniformly continuous?==

Let &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;2 defined on formula_24. Let formula_25 be an infinite hyperreal. The hyperreal number formula_26 is infinitely close to &quot;N&quot;. Meanwhile, the difference

:formula_27

is not infinitesimal. Therefore, &quot;f*&quot; fails to be microcontinuous at the hyperreal point &quot;N&quot;. Thus, the squaring function is not uniformly continuous, according to the definition in uniform continuity above.

A similar proof may be given in the standard setting .

==Example: Dirichlet function==
Consider the Dirichlet function
:formula_28

It is well known that, under the standard definition of continuity, the function is discontinuous at every point. Let us check this in terms of the hyperreal definition of continuity above, for instance let us show that the Dirichlet function is not continuous at π. Consider the continued fraction approximation an of π. Now let the index n be an infinite hypernatural number. By the transfer principle, the natural extension of the Dirichlet function takes the value 1 at an. Note that the hyperrational point an is infinitely close to π. Thus the natural extension of the Dirichlet function takes different values (0 and 1) at these two infinitely close points, and therefore the Dirichlet function is not continuous at &quot;π&quot;.

==Limit==
While the thrust of Robinson&#x27;s approach is that one can dispense with the approach using multiple quantifiers, the notion of limit can be easily recaptured in terms of the standard part function st, namely

:formula_29

if and only if whenever the difference &quot;x&quot; − &quot;a&quot; is infinitesimal, the difference &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) − &quot;L&quot; is infinitesimal, as well, or in formulas:

:if st(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;  then st(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) = L,

cf. (ε, δ)-definition of limit.

==Limit of sequence==
Given a sequence of real numbers formula_30, if formula_31 &quot;L&quot; is &quot;the limit&quot; of the sequence and

:formula_32

if for every infinite hypernatural &quot;n&quot;, st(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)=&quot;L&quot; (here the extension principle is used to define &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; for every hyperinteger &quot;n&quot;).

This definition has no quantifier alternations. The standard (ε, δ)-style definition, on the other hand, does have quantifier alternations:

:formula_33

==Extreme value theorem==

To show that a real continuous function &quot;f&quot; on [0,1] has a maximum, let &quot;N&quot; be an infinite hyperinteger. The interval [0, 1] has a natural hyperreal extension. The function &quot;f&quot; is also naturally extended to hyperreals between 0 and 1. Consider the partition of the hyperreal interval [0,1] into &quot;N&quot; subintervals of equal infinitesimal length 1/&quot;N&quot;, with partition points &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;i&quot; /&quot;N&quot; as &quot;i&quot; &quot;runs&quot; from 0 to &quot;N&quot;. In the standard setting (when &quot;N&quot; is finite), a point with the maximal value of &quot;f&quot; can always be chosen among the &quot;N&quot;+1 points &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, by induction. Hence, by the transfer principle, there is a hyperinteger &quot;i&quot;0 such that 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot;0 ≤ &quot;N&quot; and formula_34 for all &quot;i&quot; = 0, …, &quot;N&quot; (an alternative explanation is that every hyperfinite set admits a maximum). Consider the real point

:formula_35

where st is the standard part function. An arbitrary real point &quot;x&quot; lies in a suitable sub-interval of the partition, namely formula_36, so that st(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;. Applying st to the inequality formula_34, formula_38. By continuity of &quot;f&quot;,
:formula_39.
Hence &quot;f&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) ≥ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), for all &quot;x&quot;, proving &quot;c&quot; to be a maximum of the real function &quot;f&quot;.

==Intermediate value theorem==

As another illustration of the power of Robinson&#x27;s approach, a short proof of the intermediate value theorem (Bolzano&#x27;s theorem) using infinitesimals is done by the following.

Let &quot;f&quot; be a continuous function on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)&lt;0 while &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)&gt;0. Then there exists a point &quot;c&quot; in [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;c&quot;)=0.

The proof proceeds as follows. Let &quot;N&quot; be an infinite hyperinteger. Consider a partition of [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] into &quot;N&quot; intervals of equal length, with partition points &quot;xi&quot; as &quot;i&quot; runs from 0 to &quot;N&quot;. Consider the collection &quot;I&quot; of indices such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;)&gt;0. Let &quot;i&quot;0 be the least element in &quot;I&quot; (such an element exists by the transfer principle, as &quot;I&quot; is a hyperfinite set). Then the real number
formula_40
is the desired zero of &quot;f&quot;.
Such a proof reduces the quantifier complexity of a standard proof of the IVT.

== Basic theorems ==

If &quot;f&quot; is a real valued function defined on an interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], then the transfer operator applied to &quot;f&quot;, denoted by &quot;*f&quot;, is an &quot;internal&quot;, hyperreal-valued function defined on the hyperreal interval [*&quot;a&quot;, *&quot;b&quot;].

&quot;Theorem&quot;: Let &quot;f&quot; be a real-valued function defined on an
interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. Then &quot;f&quot; is differentiable at &quot;a &lt; x &lt; b&quot; if and only if
for every &quot;non-zero&quot; infinitesimal &quot;h&quot;, the value

:formula_41

is independent of &quot;h&quot;. In that case, the common value is the derivative of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;x&quot;.

This fact follows from the transfer principle of nonstandard analysis and overspill.

Note that a similar result holds for differentiability at the endpoints &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; provided the sign of the infinitesimal &quot;h&quot; is suitably restricted.

For the second theorem, the Riemann integral is defined as the limit, if it exists, of a directed family of &quot;Riemann sums&quot;; these are sums of the form

:formula_42

where

:formula_43

Such a sequence of values is called a &quot;partition&quot; or &quot;mesh&quot; and

:formula_44

the width of the mesh. In the definition of the Riemann integral, the limit of the Riemann sums is taken as the width of the mesh goes to 0.

&quot;Theorem&quot;: Let &quot;f&quot; be a real-valued function defined on an
interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. Then &quot;f&quot; is Riemann-integrable on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] if and only if
for every internal mesh of infinitesimal width, the quantity

:formula_45

is independent of the mesh. In this case, the common value is
the Riemann integral of &quot;f&quot; over [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;].

== Applications ==

One immediate application is an extension of the standard definitions of differentiation and integration to internal functions on intervals of hyperreal numbers.

An internal hyperreal-valued function &quot;f&quot; on [&quot;a, b&quot;] is &quot;S&quot;-differentiable at &quot;x&quot;, provided

:formula_46

exists and is independent of the infinitesimal &quot;h&quot;. The value is the &quot;S&quot; derivative at &quot;x&quot;.

&quot;Theorem&quot;: Suppose &quot;f&quot; is &quot;S&quot;-differentiable at every point of [&quot;a, b&quot;] where &quot;b&quot; − &quot;a&quot; is a bounded hyperreal. Suppose furthermore that

:formula_47

Then for some infinitesimal ε

:formula_48

To prove this, let &quot;N&quot; be a nonstandard natural number. Divide the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] into &quot;N&quot; subintervals by placing &quot;N&quot; − 1 equally spaced intermediate points:

:formula_49

Then

:formula_50

Now the maximum of any internal set of infinitesimals is infinitesimal. Thus all the εk&#x27;s are dominated by an infinitesimal ε. Therefore,

:formula_51

from which the result follows.

<text>A rash is a change of the skin that affects its color, appearance, or texture.

A rash may be localized in one part of the body, or affect all the skin. Rashes may cause the skin to change color, itch, become warm, bumpy, chapped, dry, cracked or blistered, swell, and may be painful.
The causes, and therefore treatments for rashes, vary widely. Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash, other symptoms, what the patient may have been exposed to, occupation, and occurrence in family members. The diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions.
The presence of a rash may aid diagnosis; associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases. For example, the rash in measles is an erythematous, morbilliform, maculopapular rash that begins a few days after the fever starts. It classically starts at the head, and spreads downwards.

== Differential diagnosis ==
Common causes of rashes include:
* Food allergy
* Medication side effects
* Anxiety
* Allergies, for example to food, dyes, medicines, insect stings, metals such as zinc or nickel; such rashes are often called hives.
* Skin contact with an irritant
** Fungal infection, such as ringworm
** Balsam of Peru
* Skin diseases such as eczema or acne
* Exposure to sun (sunburn) or heat
* Friction due to chafing of the skin
* Irritation such as caused by abrasives impregnated in clothing rubbing the skin. The cloth itself may be abrasive enough for some people
* Secondary syphilis
* Poor personal hygiene
Uncommon causes:
* Autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis
* Lead poisoning
* Pregnancy
* Repeated scratching on a particular spot
* Lyme disease
* Scarlet fever
* COVID-19 (see )

===Conditions===
==Diagnostic approach==

The causes of a rash are numerous, which may make the evaluation of a rash extremely difficult. An accurate evaluation by a provider may only be made in the context of a thorough history, i.e. medications the patient is taking, the patient&#x27;s occupation, where the patient has been and complete physical examination.

Points typically noted in the examination include:
* The appearance: e.g., purpuric (typical of vasculitis and meningococcal disease), fine and like sandpaper (typical of scarlet fever); circular lesions with a central depression are typical of molluscum contagiosum (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales are typical of psoriasis.
* The distribution: e.g., the rash of scarlet fever becomes confluent and forms bright red lines in the skin creases of the neck, armpits and groins (Pastia&#x27;s lines); the vesicles of chicken pox seem to follow the hollows of the body (they are more prominent along the depression of the spine on the back and in the hollows of both shoulder blades); very few rashes affect the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (secondary syphilis, rickettsia or spotted fevers, guttate psoriasis, hand, foot and mouth disease, keratoderma blennorrhagicum);
* Symmetry: e.g., herpes zoster usually only affects one side of the body and does not cross the midline.

A patch test may be ordered, for diagnostic purposes.

==Treatment==

Treatment differs according to which rash a patient has been diagnosed with. Common rashes can be easily remedied using steroid topical creams (such as hydrocortisone) or non-steroidal treatments. Many of the medications are available over the counter in the United States.

The problem with steroid topical creams i.e. hydrocortisone; is their inability to penetrate the skin through absorption and therefore not be effective in clearing up the affected area, thus rendering the hydrocortisone almost completely ineffective in all except the most mild of cases.

<doc id="643024" wikidata="Q784831" url="?curid=643024" title="Autoweek">
<text>Autoweek is a car culture publication and magazine based in Detroit, Michigan. It was first published in 1958 and in 1977 the publication was purchased by Crain Communications Inc, its current brand licensor. The magazine was published weekly and focused on motor sports, new car reviews, and old cars, events and DIY. Autoweek now publishes Autoweek.com.
Autoweek brand is owned by Crain Communications Inc., publisher of leading industry trade publications Advertising Age and Automotive News, among others, and is based in Detroit, Michigan.

The Autoweek also includes an &quot;Autoweek&quot; iPhone and iPad app.

As of November 2019 the publication went digital and was no longer available in printed format. Hearst Magazines entered a multi-year licensing deal with Crain Communications to operate the digital and experiential businesses of &quot;Autoweek&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Autoweek&quot; began publication in 1958 as a bi-weekly motorsports newsletter, titled &quot;Competition Press&quot;. One of the editors involved with the creation of the magazine was professional racer Denise McCluggage. In 1964, distribution was changed to weekly, the title was changed to &quot;Competition Press &amp; Autoweek&quot;, and vehicle reviews and industry news were included. The name was shortened to &quot;Autoweek&quot; in 1975.

In 1977, the magazine was purchased by Crain Communications, Inc. and eventually changed into a magazine in 1986. In 1988, Leon Mandel was named Publisher, a position he held until November, 2001. Leon&#x27;s son, Dutch Mandel, joined &quot;Autoweek&quot; in 1997 holding leadership positions culminating with his time as publisher. In 2016, Mandel left Autoweek and Rory Carroll became interim-publisher and later, publisher. In 2019, Patrick Carone became editorial director.

==Editorial direction==
At its launch, &quot;Autoweek&quot; (then titled: &quot;Competition Press&quot;) aimed to provide information for car and racing enthusiasts that was not readily available through other media outlets. The publication gave thorough coverage of major and minor races, as well as auto shows. Auto racing coverage included full grids, qualifying times, speeds, and tires, for both amateur and professional races. As television and cable began increasing motorsports coverage during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s &quot;Autoweek&quot; began to focus more prominently on automotive enthusiasts. As of 2012, in addition to covering auto racing and auto shows, &quot;Autoweek&quot; covers vehicle trends, reviews and automotive lifestyle stories.

<text>King Peak (sometimes called Mount King) is the fourth-highest mountain in Canada and the ninth-highest peak in North America. Situated just west of Mount Logan (highest in Canada), in Yukon, it is considered a satellite peak of the massive mountain.

== Climbing history ==
The first ascent of King Peak was made in 1952 by some students from the University of Alaska. Russell Alston Paige, Keith Hart, Elton Thayer and Bill Atwood walked to the Ogilvie Glacier at the foot of Quartz Ridge where the majority of their supplies had been air dropped. They reached Camp 2 on the west ridge on June 3. After waiting two days for a storm to subside, Hart and Thayer set out for the summit while Atwood remained in camp due to a knee injury. After struggling with rock towers and icy crests, they reached the top on June 6, 1952.

The second and third ascents were also completed in 1952 by an American team who had also just made the first ascent of Mount Augusta. From the south side of King Peak, they made their way up to the east ridge occasionally traversing to the north side to avoid steep slopes. After two failed summit attempts on July 20 and 21, Pete Schoening and Gibson Reynolds succeeded in negotiating the gendarme that had rebuffed the failed attempts and reached the top on July 23. Schoening returned the next day with Dick McGowan and Bill Niendorff to complete the third ascent.

<text>The Clearwater River () is on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The river originates on the northern slopes of Mount Mitchell on the western end of the Victoria Range, only one valley north of the Fox Glacier and Fox River. Clearwater River and its tributary creeks drain land to the north of the Cook River / Weheka. The river flows under a bridge of just north of the Fox Glacier township and passes close to Lake Matheson shortly after before flowing into Cook River / Weheka, which drains into the Tasman Sea.

<doc id="643036" wikidata="Q1307489" url="?curid=643036" title="Input impedance">
<text>In electrical engineering, the input impedance of an electrical network is the measure of the opposition to current (impedance), both static (resistance) and dynamic (reactance), into a load network or circuit that is &quot;external&quot; to the electrical source network. The input admittance (the reciprocal of impedance) is a measure of the load network&#x27;s propensity to draw current. The source network is the portion of the network that transmits power, and the load network is the portion of the network that consumes power.

For an electrical property measurement instrument like an oscilloscope, the instrument is a load circuit to an electrical circuit (source circuit) to be measured, so the input impedance is the impedance of the instrument seen by the circuit to be measured.

==Input impedance ==
If the load network were replaced by a device with an output impedance equal to the input impedance of the load network (equivalent circuit), the characteristics of the source-load network would be the same from the perspective of the connection point. So, the voltage across and the current through the input terminals would be identical to the chosen load network.

Therefore, the input impedance of the load and the output impedance of the source determine how the source current and voltage change. 

The Thévenin&#x27;s equivalent circuit of the electrical network uses the concept of input impedance to determine the impedance of the equivalent circuit.

== Calculation ==
If one were to create a circuit with equivalent properties across the input terminals by placing the input impedance across the load of the circuit and the output impedance in series with the signal source, Ohm&#x27;s law could be used to calculate the transfer function. 

===Electrical efficiency===
The values of the input and output impedance are often used to evaluate the electrical efficiency of networks by breaking them up into multiple stages and evaluating the efficiency of the interaction between each stage independently. To minimize electrical losses, the output impedance of the signal should be insignificant in comparison to the input impedance of the network being connected, as the gain is equivalent to the ratio of the input impedance to the total impedance (input impedance + output impedance). In this case, 
:formula_1 (or formula_2)
:&quot;The input impedance of the driven stage (load) is much larger than the output impedance of the drive stage (source).&quot;

====Power factor====
In AC circuits carrying power, the losses of energy in conductors due to the reactive component of the impedance can be significant. These losses manifest themselves in a phenomenon called phase imbalance, where the current is out of phase (lagging behind or ahead) with the voltage. Therefore, the product of the current and the voltage is less than what it would be if the current and voltage were in phase. With DC sources, reactive circuits have no impact, therefore power factor correction is not necessary. 

For a circuit to be modelled with an ideal source, output impedance, and input impedance; the circuit&#x27;s input reactance can be sized to be the negative of the output reactance at the source. In this scenario, the reactive component of the input impedance cancels the reactive component of the output impedance at the source. The resulting equivalent circuit is purely resistive in nature, and there are no losses due to phase imbalance in the source or the load.
:formula_3

===Power transfer===
The condition of maximum power transfer states that for a given source maximum power will be transferred when the resistance of the source is equal to the resistance of the load and the power factor is corrected by canceling out the reactance. When this occurs the circuit is said to be &quot;complex conjugate matched&quot; to the signals impedance. Note this only maximizes the power transfer, not the efficiency of the circuit. When the power transfer is optimized the circuit only runs at 50% efficiency. 

The formula for complex conjugate matched is 
:formula_4
When there is no reactive component this equation simplifies to formula_5 as the imaginary part of formula_6 is zero.

===Impedance matching===
When the characteristic impedance of a transmission line, formula_7, does not match the impedance of the load network, formula_8, the load network will reflect back some of the source signal. This can create standing waves on the transmission line. To minimize reflections, the characteristic impedance of the transmission line and the impedance of the load circuit have to be equal (or &quot;matched&quot;). If the impedance matches, the connection is known as a &quot;matched connection&quot;, and the process of correcting an impedance mismatch is called &quot;impedance matching&quot;. Since the characteristic impedance for a homogeneous transmission line is based on geometry alone and is therefore constant, and the load impedance can be measured independently, the matching condition holds regardless of the placement of the load (before or after the transmission line).
:formula_9

==Applications==

===Signal processing===

In modern signal processing, devices, such as operational amplifiers, are designed to have an input impedance several orders of magnitude higher than the output impedance of the source device connected to that input. This is called impedance bridging. The losses due to input impedance (loss) in these circuits will be minimized, and the voltage at the input of the amplifier will be close to voltage as if the amplifier circuit was not connected. When a device whose input impedance could cause significant degradation of the signal is used, often a device with a high input impedance and a low output impedance is used to minimize its effects. Voltage follower or impedance-matching transformers are often used for these effects.

The input impedance for high-impedance amplifiers (such as vacuum tubes, field effect transistor amplifiers and op-amps) is often specified as a resistance &quot;in parallel with&quot; a capacitance (e.g., 2.2MΩ ∥ 1pF). Pre-amplifiers designed for high input impedance may have a slightly higher effective noise voltage at the input (while providing a low effective noise current), and so slightly more noisy than an amplifier designed for a specific low-impedance source, but in general a relatively low-impedance source configuration will be more resistant to noise (particularly mains hum).

===Radio frequency power systems===

Signal reflections caused by an impedance mismatch at the end of a transmission line can result in distortion and potential damage to the driving circuitry.

In analog video circuits, impedance mismatch can cause &quot;ghosting&quot;, where the time-delayed echo of the principal image appears as a weak and displaced image (typically to the right of the principal image). In high-speed digital systems, such as HD video, reflections result in interference and potentially corrupt signal. 

The standing waves created by the mismatch are periodic regions of higher than normal voltage. If this voltage exceeds the dielectric breakdown strength of the insulating material of the line then an arc will occur. This in turn can cause a reactive pulse of high voltage that can destroy the transmitter&#x27;s final output stage.

In RF systems, typical values for line and termination impedance are 50 Ω and 75 Ω.

To maximise power transmission for radio frequency power systems the circuits should be &quot;complex conjugate matched&quot; throughout the power chain, from the transmitter output, through the transmission line (a balanced pair, a coaxial cable, or a waveguide), to the antenna &quot;system&quot;, which consists of an impedance matching device and the radiating element(s).

<text>The Cook River / Weheka is in the South Island of New Zealand. The headwaters are from the La Perouse Glacier on the western flanks of the Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana, and it flows west, then northeast, then northwest and into the Tasman Sea. Its tributaries include the Balfour River, fed by Balfour Glacier, and the Fox River, fed by Fox Glacier / Te Moeka o Tuawe. Much of the river lies within the Westland Tai Poutini National Park.
The river was renamed from Cook River to Cook River / Weheka as a result of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.

Brown trout can be fished for in the river.

Access along the river by foot is difficult beyond the junction with the Balfour River. There are no approved helicopter landing sites in the river valley, but there are chamois, tahr and small numbers of red deer available to hunters.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney F119, company designation PW5000, is an afterburning turbofan engine developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, which resulted in the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The engine delivers thrust in the class and was designed for sustained supersonic flight without afterburners, or supercruise. Delivering almost 22% more thrust with 40% fewer parts than its F100 predecessor, the F119 allows the F-22 to achieve supercruise speeds of up to Mach 1.8. The F119&#x27;s nozzles incorporate thrust vectoring that enable them to direct the engine thrust ±20° in the pitch axis to give the F-22 enhanced maneuverability.

The F119 is also the basis for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) propulsion system, with variants powering both the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 concept demonstrators. The X-35 won the JSF competition and the production Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is powered by an F119 derivative, the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 which produces up to of thrust.

==History==
The F119 resulted from the Joint Advanced Fighter Engine (JAFE) program in the early 1980s aimed at supplying the powerplant for the Air Force&#x27;s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) and the Navy&#x27;s Advanced Carrier-Based Multirole Fighter (VFMX). Detailed design of Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s submission, designated internally as PW5000, began when the request for proposals (RFP) for JAFE, later renamed the ATF Engine (ATFE) program with the cancellation of VFMX, was released in May 1983. Advances in engine technology, such as those from the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator (ATEGG) and the Joint Technology Demonstration Engine (JTDE) programs, allowed the design to do more work with fewer stages, with the PW5000&#x27;s compressor having only 6 stages compared to the 10 stages in the F100&#x27;s compressor. The high pressure and low pressure turbines were single stage and counter-rotating, which reduced the gyroscopic forces on the engine; it was hoped that counter-rotation would eliminate a row of turbine stators for a vaneless high and low pressure turbine interface, which would save weight and reduce parts count, but this was ultimately not successful and the stators were retained. The fan and compressor stages were to use integrally bladed rotors (IBR), also known as blisks, to reduce weight and cost and improve performance. Owing to the ATF&#x27;s demanding requirements for supercruise, the PW5000 design has low bypass ratio, high core and turbine inlet temperatures, and a fully variable convergent-divergent nozzle to achieve high specific thrust in intermediate, or non-afterburning power. The combustor, internally named Floatwall, eliminated welds to mitigate crack growth due to thermal cycling. The original RFP called for maximum thrust in the class for an aircraft gross weight of .

Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric were selected to make prototype engines, designated YF119 and YF120 respectively, for demonstration and validation (Dem/Val). Both engine makers would provide engines for both the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 and the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 ATF technology and flight demonstrators. The ATF&#x27;s increasing weight during development required more thrust to meet the performance requirements; as gross weight grew to , the required thrust was increased by 20% to over in military/intermediate power and class in full afterburner. Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s design changed to incorporate a 15% larger fan, increasing bypass ratio from 0.25 to 0.30. However, unlike General Electric, Pratt &amp; Whitney did not fit its larger fan on flightworthy YF119s for the ATF flight demonstrators to avoid potential reliability issues that may arise. Instead, the revised fan was extensively ground tested at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. As a result, both the YF-22 and YF-23 had lower performance with the YF119s than with the YF120s.

On 3 August 1991, Pratt &amp; Whitney was awarded the EMD contract for ATF engine, while the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics team won the contract for the ATF airframe. While the YF119 was a more conventional design compared to the General Electric&#x27;s variable cycle YF120, Pratt &amp; Whitney accrued far greater test hours (50% more) and emphasized reliability and the lower risk. Ground tests of the EMD F119-PW-100 were first conducted in February 1993. The production engines were fitted on the production F-22, and were first flown on the F-22&#x27;s maiden flight on 7 September 1997. A total of 507 engines were produced. The F119 Heavy Maintenance Center (HMC) for depot overhaul is located at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, with the first overall completed in 2013.

Turbine engine advances from ATEGG and JTDE continued with the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program, with applications in F119 improvement packages and derivatives. Prototype YF119 variants powered the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) concept demonstrator aircraft, and subsequent full scale development of the F119 derivative resulted in the F135 family of engines that powers the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

==Design==
The F119 is a twin-spool axial-flow low-bypass turbofan. It has a three-stage fan driven by a single-stage low pressure turbine and six-stage high pressure compressor driven by single-stage high pressure turbine. The shroud-less fan has wide-chord, low aspect ratio hollow titanium fan blades that are linear-friction welded to the disks to form single-piece integrally-bladed rotors (IBRs), or blisks. The fan and compressor stators and thrust-vectoring nozzle use a burn-resistant titanium alloy called Alloy C, with the first row of vanes variable in order to increase stall and surge margin. The Floatwall annular combustor is lined with high-cobalt material for oxidation resistance and combustion chamber durability, and ensures the clean burning of the fuel and reduced NOx generation. Within the turbine exhaust case, the high-pressure turbine blades are made of single-crystal superalloys and impingement cooled using air from the high-pressure compressor. The high and low pressure spools are counter-rotating. The requirement for the ATF to supercruise, or fly supersonic without afterburners, results in a very low bypass ratio of 0.30 for the F119-PW-100 in order to achieve high specific thrust. The F119 has dual-redundant full authority digital engine control (FADEC), also referred to internally as Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC), supplied by Hamilton Standard and fully integrated into the F-22&#x27;s vehicle management system, making the engine highly reliable, stall-resistant, and forgiving of rapid throttle inputs.
The three-zone (reduced from four from the prototype) afterburner, or augmentor, contributes to the stealth of the aircraft by having fuel injectors integrated into thick curved vanes coated with ceramic radar-absorbent materials (RAM). These vanes replace the traditional fuel spray bars and flame holders and block line-of-sight of the turbines. The rectangular convergent-divergent nozzle is fully variable for both the convergent throat and divergent areas for high nozzle pressure ratio and can vector ±20° in the pitch axis, greatly improving the aircraft&#x27;s pitch authority by augmenting the pitching moment of the tail with engine thrust; this enables the F-22 to remain controllable while flying at a trimmed alpha of over 60°. The thrust vectoring is fully integrated into the F-22&#x27;s flight control system to facilitate handling. The rectangular nozzle&#x27;s divergent section consists two wedge-shaped flaps for stealth and also contribute to lower infrared signature by flattening the exhaust plume and facilitating its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices.

The F119 places a high emphasis on human systems integration; features that facilitate engine maintenance and servicing include modular design such as an axially split case, color-coded cables and harnesses, and a reduction of the number of hand tools required for servicing to just five. Most components are one-deep and servicing can be conducted while wearing hazmat protective clothing. The engine has a design life of 8,650 total accumulated cycles, with inspection and overhaul of the hot section approximately every 2,000 hours and the cold section every 4,000 hours.

===Prototype variants===
While the production F119 on the F-22 incorporates rectangular thrust vectoring nozzles, prototype variants on other aircraft had different nozzle solutions that are tailored to the airframe.
The YF119 on the YF-23 had a single-expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) consisting of a variable wedge flap on the top and a fixed ramp on the bottom, which then transitions to a trench on top of the aft fuselage. While the SERN lacked thrust vectoring capability, it allowed the exhaust to be further cooled in the trenches, significantly reducing infrared signature when viewed from below the aircraft; the trenches in the aft deck were lined with tiles that were &quot;transpiration cooled&quot; from engine bleed air to withstand the heat of the exhaust.

The specialized YF119 variants on the X-32 and X-35 had provisions for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) operations. The YF119-PW-614 on the X-32 had a pitch-axis thrust vectoring nozzle and valves can redirect the engine exhaust and bleed air to provide direct lift, similar to the Pegasus engine on the Harrier. In contrast, YF119-PW-611 on the X-35 had a round axisymmetric nozzle that can swivel downwards while the low-pressure spool drives a lift fan that&#x27;s engaged through a clutch; engine bypass air is also routed to roll posts for additional lift and stability. The X-35 won the JSF competition and its shaft-driven lift fan system, called LiftSystem, was fully developed by Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney for the F135-PW-600.

<text>Sztum () (formerly ) is a town in northern Poland in the Powiśle region, located in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. It is the capital of Sztum County, with some 10,141 inhabitants (2004).

==History==

Signs of settlement dating back to the Roman Empire era have been found. In the early Middle Ages, a fortified settlement of the Old Prussians existed at the site, conquered by the Teutonic Knights in 1236. The castle was captured by the Poles after the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. Town rights were granted to the settlement in 1416 and confirmed by King Sigismund II Augustus in 1553.

In 1441 both the town and the local Teutonic county official joined the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and upon the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. The castle, which initially remained in the hands of the Teutonic Knights, was captured by Poles after a siege in 1454, but later it was taken over by the Teutonic Knights again. In 1466 by the Second Peace of Toruń the town was finally renounced by the Teutonic Knights and integrated with the Kingdom of Poland. As part of Poland, the town functioned as a seat of the Sztum County in Malbork Voivodeship and a place to hold the voivodeship&#x27;s sejmiks (regional court sessions). The Sztum Castle was the seat of the local starosts. In 1506 and 1512 the town was visited by Nicolaus Copernicus, and in 1552 it was visited by Polish King Sigismund II Augustus. 

In 1772 as a result of the First Partition of Poland the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. In October–December 1831, some Polish infantry units and intendant troops of the November Uprising stopped in the town on the way to their final internment places. In 1871, it became part of the newly created German Empire. In 1910, the Polish &quot;Bank Ludowy&quot; was founded in the town.

According to the Treaty of Versailles, after World War I the inhabitants of the town and its district were asked whether they want to remain in Germany or join the new Second Polish Republic in the East Prussian plebiscite of 1920. Ultimately in Stuhm, 2,079 (73.5%) votes were cast in favor of remaining in Germany and 751 (26.5%) votes were in favor of rejoining Poland. Based on that result, Stuhm was included in the Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder within East Prussia in Germany. In the interwar period, Sztum remained one of the main centers of the Polish community in the area. The Germans arrested 30 local Polish activists in August 1939, before the invasion of Poland which started World War II. During the war, the Germans operated a Nazi prison in the town. After World War II, Sztum again became part of Poland, under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference.

On 14 July 2012 the town and surrounding areas, including Barlewice, were hit by a Low-End F3/T6 tornado, resulting in one injury. Buildings saw significant roof damage, some of which were entirely torn off. Other buildings were damaged as well. The tornado was part of an outbreak that produced several tornadoes, one of which killed a person.

<doc id="643050" wikidata="Q476082" url="?curid=643050" title="M10 motorway (Great Britain)">
<text>The M10 was a motorway in Hertfordshire, England, running for approximately 3 miles (4.5 km) southeast from the M1 motorway at junction 7 near Hemel Hempstead to the A414 North Orbital Road at Park Street Roundabout, just south of St Albans. Opened in 1959, it was reclassified as part of the A414 in 2009 having only been a spur motorway for about 50 years.

==History==
The M10 opened on 2 November 1959 along with the M1 and M45, and was designed and constructed by Tarmac Construction as part of the St Albans bypass (along with the M1 between junctions 5 and 10).

At the time, the M1&#x27;s southern terminus was at junction 5 at Berrygrove, with the main route from there to the A1 in London being via the A41 Watford Bypass. Since the capacity of the A roads was much less than that of the motorway, a distributing spur was required to split up the traffic and reduce congestion at Berrygrove. The M10 was thus built to distribute southbound traffic on the M1 onto the A5 (now A5183) and, as an alternative, via the North Orbital Road and the A6 to the A1 Barnet Bypass.

The M45 was the equivalent distributing spur at the northern end of the M1, and is thus regarded as a sister motorway to the M10.

In later years, as the M1 was extended southwards into London and the M25 was built, the M10&#x27;s original purpose eroded. It was sometimes suggested that the motorway might have been extended to meet the M25 at junction 22, but this was never proposed.

==Downgrade==
In December 2008, widening of the M1 between the M25 and Luton was completed, with non-motorway collector/distributor lanes built to link junction 8 of the M1, at Hemel Hempstead, with junction 7 and the M10. As traffic could now travel between Hemel Hempstead and Park Street Roundabout without having to access the M1, there was no need to keep the M10 as a motorway. Hence, on 1 May 2009, the M10 was downgraded to an A road, and designated as part of the A414. This also released the &quot;M10&quot; designation for use elsewhere.
This also had the added bonus of allowing lorries to park when waiting for access to a proposed rail freight depot. Otherwise if the proposed rail freight depot went ahead and it had remained a motorway there would have been nowhere for lorries to wait.

<doc id="643051" wikidata="Q2725470" url="?curid=643051" title="Mount Steele">
<text>Mount Steele is the fifth-highest mountain in Canada and either the tenth- or eleventh-highest peak in North America. Its exact elevation is uncertain. Commonly-quoted figures are and . A lower southeast peak of Mt. Steele stands at .

It was named after Sir Sam Steele, the North-West Mounted Police officer in charge of the force in the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush.

== Elevation ==
Mount Steele&#x27;s exact elevation is uncertain. Until the 1960s, Canadian topographical maps showed an elevation of , which was determined in 1913 by International Boundary Commission surveyors. However, this height was never tied to the sea-level datum established by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. More recent Canadian topographical maps no longer show a spot height, and their contour lines indicate a summit elevation of 5,02020 metres (about 16,47060 ft). The older figure continues to be quoted by other sources.

== First ascent in 1935 ==
Walter A. Wood led a team consisting of Foresta Wood (Walter&#x27;s wife), Swiss guide Hans Fuhrer, Joseph W. Fobes, Harrison Wood and I. Pearce Hazard. The expedition approached the peak on the eastern side from Kluane Lake. Base camp was established at the foot of the Steele Glacier with horses carrying loads to Advance Base Camp (known as Camp 6) further along the glacier. ABC provided good views of the mountain and the team decided on the east ridge as their line of ascent.

After waiting for the weather to improve after heavy snowfalls, a four-man team consisting of Walter Wood, Harrison Wood, Fuhrer and Forbes left Camp 8 at the base of the ridge. Their plan to was to make a push to the summit. After steady upwards progress, deteriorating weather forced them to return to Camp 8 where they waited out a five-day storm which dumped over a metre of fresh snow. They started out again on August 15 and the ascent was made easier this time by windblown and hard steep snow slopes rather than steep soft snow on their earlier attempt. At , a plateau of wretched snow forced the team to crawl on all fours. Walter Wood commented:
Alternating the lead every 100 paces, they made their way from the plateau to the top, finally reaching the summit at 2:30 pm. The team enjoyed a blissful thirty minutes of windless conditions on top before beginning their descent.

== Avalanche and landslides ==
On 22 July 2007 at approximately 13:25 Pacific Daylight Time, a massive avalanche took place on Mount Steele when a slab of ice with a volume of about broke loose from its north face. The slab broke up as it fell down the side of the mountain, developing into an avalanche that crossed Steele Glacier, overtopped a ridge, and continued onto Hodgson Glacier, where it finally came to rest after traveling a total horizontal distance of . The avalanche covered about of the surface of Steele Glacier. The avalanche registered as a 2.1-magnitude seismic event.

At 17:57 Pacific Daylight Time on 24 July 2007 – only two days after the avalanche — a massive landslide occurred on the north face of Mount Steele when a section of ice and rock fell. With a volume estimated at between , it lasted about 100 seconds and reached a maximum speed of at least . Falling down the side of the mountain, the landslide traveled across the Steele Glacier, and reached the top of a ridge on the opposite side of the glacier, where it came to a stop before sliding back down onto Steele Glacier. It traveled a total horizontal distance of . It was immediately recognized as one of the largest landslides in Yukon Territory history, if not the largest, and is one of the largest in the recorded history of western Canada.

On 11 October 2015, of rock, snow, and ice with a volume of about slid down the side of Mount Steele and across the surface of Steele Glacier. It was one of the ten largest landslides of the year worldwide.

<text>The Buller River () is a river in the South Island of New Zealand. The Buller has the highest flow of any river in the country during floods, though it is only the 13th longest river; it runs for from Lake Rotoiti through the Buller Gorge and into the Tasman Sea near the town of Westport. A saddle at separates the Buller from the Motupiko River and that is divided from the Wairau River by a saddle, both aligned along the Alpine Fault, as is the top of the Buller valley.

Within the Buller Gorge and downstream from the Deepdale River joining, the Buller crosses from Tasman District into Buller District. The Paparoa Range separates the Buller River from the Grey River. A number of flora and fauna are found in the Buller catchment, many of these extending onto the slopes of the Paparoa Range.

The Buller River upstream from Murchison along with the Mangles River are popular for whitewater kayaking and recreational fishing, though the whole river can be kayaked; it is the only major river in the country with no hydro lakes, though a seismic survey for hydro power was done in 1973. For experienced canoeists the Ariki Falls section, between Murchison and Newton Flat, is also popular and novices can use it by carrying kayaks around the rapids, except when the river is very low and the rapids become unnavigable. The river is suitable for contact recreation approximately 95% of the time, though Tasman Council recognises it needs to be better because of the popularity of whitewater kayaking below Gowan Bridge.

 follows the river for , SH63, upstream from SH6, for and the Stillwater–Ngākawau railway line runs through the Lower Gorge to Westport. follows the river for much of its length.

This river has an annual mean flow of , is estimated to have reached in the 1926 flood and has the highest flood flow in the country of over . 93% of the water comes from the western mountains, which make up only 38% of the catchment, and it is highest in summer, partly due to melting snow.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Excavations at the mouth of the river, across from Westport, uncovered 77 stone adzes, 2,693 stone flakes (argillite, chert, obsidian and silcrete from manufacture of stone tools), minnow lures, moa bone, sites of huts, ovens, middens and urupā, with one shell carbon dated to between 1219 and 1316. Early trading is indicated by argillite from Ohana, at the south end of D&#x27;Urville Island, chert from upper North island and obsidian from Mayor Island / Tūhua. In 2004 the site was described as one of the largest and best preserved large Archaic sites in the country. More investigation may reveal whether it was occupied for more than a few years.

Subsequent pre-colonial history is obscure. The Waitangi Tribunal concluded that, &quot;very little is known about the history of Ngāti Apa&#x27;s occupation of the region . . . invasion by northern tribes in the early nineteenth century made it difficult to pass on any substantial record of the traditional history of this area&quot; and it was &quot;probably an area of migratory resource use rather than permanent occupation&quot;. One migratory resource was Ngāi Tahu&#x27;s pounamu trade, which had a greenstone trail through the valley, probably in summer, when the river would usually be lower. By virtue of a taua of 1829–1832, Ngāti Toa Rangatira was recognised in 2012 as having an interest in the upper part of the river.

=== European settlement ===
Europeans first discovered Lake Rotoiti in 1842. The first written record of the river mouth was in 1845, when a sealing captain, Joseph Thoms, was reported as finding, &quot;a large river, a mile wide. It has a bar at the entrance, on which he took soundings, and found sixteen feet at high water. The river appeared to be navigable for a considerable distance. Mr. Thoms anchored his vessel in five fathoms, and pulled up four or five miles in his boat. He describes the valley through which the river runs to be twenty miles wide, finely wooded, with some open land.&quot;

In 1846 Brunner was the first European to follow the full length of the Buller, together with his guide, E Kehu, of Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri, who already knew the area well (Ekehu had been taken prisoner by Ngāi Tahu while living near the Grey River). That expedition lasted almost 560 days. The journey was so difficult that they left Lake Rotoiti on 31 December 1846, but only reached the mouth of the river on 4 June 1847. They returned up the Buller, leaving Inangahua on 23 March 1848 and reached Lake Rotoiti again on 12 June 1848.

Surveyor John Rochfort discovered gold and coal in the Buller valley in 1859. Despite this indication of the land&#x27;s value, the 1860 Arahura Deed sold most of the West Coast to the government for £300 (about 1d per 100 acres), covering a total of , which included virtually all of the Buller valley south from the Gowan River.

A West Coast gold rush, coal mines and timber sawmills resulted in a rapid population increase in the 1860s. By 1867 there were 6,087 miners in Nelson Province and 10,466 people (and 1,612 tents, indicating the temporary nature of their stay) in Westland North, which also included the Grey valley. About 1,500 were in Westport in 1867, which was then the 3rd largest port for exporting gold, after Hokitika and Dunedin.

==== Name ====
William Fox was the New Zealand Company agent (a UK-based company of 1837, with a royal charter supporting colonisation efforts) in Nelson, when he, Thomas Brunner and Charles Heaphy, explored the Buller as far south as Murchison in February 1846. In a report to Colonel Wakefield, Fox said, &quot;As it will present a considerable feature on the maps of this island, I have called it the Buller, after the member for Liskeard&quot;, who was Charles Buller, a UK Member of Parliament and director of the New Zealand Company.

The original Māori name for the Buller may have been &quot;Kawatiri&quot;, although Patrick O&#x27;Regan thought that was a misunderstanding of Ka Awatiri. He translated &quot;Awatiri&quot; as a rapid river. The first 1846 expedition named the Buller valley around Murchison as the Aglionby valley, after the English MP, Henry Aglionby Aglionby. In 1911 O&#x27;Regan suggested it had dropped out of use because it was hard to pronounce.

==== River modifications ====
Organs Island was created, about upstream from Westport, when a loop in the Buller was bypassed by a straight flood relief channel built between 1882 and 1886. The old river course became silted up between 1925 and 1945, but part of it remains to allow Buller floodwater to overflow into the Orowaiti River. A wall in that overflow was repaired in 2022 after flooding.

==== Transport ====
Until roads were built, goods were carried from Westport to Lyell in fleets of canoes, or, later, horse-drawn boats, carrying up to 7 tons, or 12 tons up to Inangahua. They could take 11 weeks to make the journey, but the from Lyell could also be covered in 7 hours downstream.

Roads in the valley evolved. In good weather a footpath was passable along the length of the valley by 1864. Horses could usually travel from Nelson to Lyell by 1867 and wheeled traffic by 1876. A dray road opening from Inangahua to Lyell in 1878 facilitated animal-drawn transport vehicles.

A telegraph line opened to Lyell in 1874.

Job Lines began a link between Westport and Reefton in 1876, using horses from Westport and a coach from the Landing to Reefton. By July 1877 the road through the Lower Gorge had improved sufficiently for the coach to run through to Westport. The road near Tiroroa included two short tunnels, until Fern Arch was demolished in 1937.

The first Newman Brothers coach ran between Foxhill (end of the Nelson railway) and Hampden (Murchison) on 22 July 1879, following improvements to the road, was extended to Lyell in 1880 and, by Job Lines, to Reefton in 1882. A motor service began in 1913, allowing the journey between Westport and Nelson to be made in a day. A daily bus linking Nelson and Westport began in 1923. InterCity now runs buses on 4 days a week, taking 3 hours 29 minutes, including a 15 minute break at Murchison. By car the route takes a bit under 3 hours.

In 1964 the Nelson-Murchison Railways Road Services route was taken over by Nelson Suburban Bus Co.

===== Bridges =====

* The first bridge up the river is Buller Bridge, opened in 1888 as a road-rail bridge on the Cape Foulwind Railway and built by M&#x27;Lean and Son of Wellington for £13,704 15s 6d. It was a long, iron lattice bridge. That original bridge was replaced in 1976 by a concrete road bridge, slightly upstream. A ferry, and later a punt, crossed the river from Nine Mile Road, Te Kuha, from 1874. The punt was swept away in a 1908 flood, five horses were drowned and the coach was left in shallow water. It also broke free, or was damaged, in 1909 and 1926 floods. The last punt was built about 1914 and it closed in 1927.
* By 1911 there was a suspension bridge over the river, just downstream from Buller. Between 1928 and 1931 a suspension footbridge was also built over the river, from Westport, to link the railway construction workers&#x27; camp to the railway. It&#x27;s sometimes not clear in accounts which bridge is being described. Both bridges had gone by 1972.
* Buller River bridge No.89, on the Stillwater–Ngākawau Line, crosses the river near Inangahua. It is long, on 6 x spans, resting on diameter piles.
* Iron Bridge at Lyell, on SH6, was built by J &amp; A Anderson of Christchurch for £8,957 and replaced the punt on 4 August 1890. The Warren truss bridge spans , supported by a central pier in the river.
* Buller Gorge Swingbridge (suspension bridge) is about a kilometre below Ariki Falls. It is long and above the river.
* O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s Bridge, also on SH6, was built in 1908 and rebuilt in 1975.
* Longford Bridge, also on SH6, was rebuilt in 1966. The pre-stressed concrete, box girder bridge is long, with a main span of , above normal water level. It was built upstream of the 1899 single-lane, wooden, suspension bridge and cost £47,490.
* Nuggety Creek Bridge was built about 1919 to give access to Nuggety Creek Road and now has a 25 tonne weight limit.
* Gowan Valley Bridge was built between 1914 and 1917.
* Harleys Rock Bridge at Devils Grip, on SH63, was first built about 1875 and upgraded about 1928. The present concrete bridge was built in 1979.
* Upper Buller Bridge is on SH63. It was built in 1868 and rebuilt in 1928 and 1981.
* Buller Bridge on Mount Robert Road was built about 1955 and rebuilt in 2015.

== Natural history ==
In 1846 the land around what was later Westport was described as covered to the river edge with totara and kahikatea. Much of the river flows through beech forest, with matagouri scrub and mānuka in the upper reaches. Carmichaelia (New Zealand broom) grows in the lower valley, especially around Lyell. Along the river most lowland forest on the fertile alluvial soils has been felled, but stands of kahikatea and rimu remain in some inland lowland basins. Other trees and bushes in the valley include mountain akeake, daisy bush, Hector&#x27;s tree daisy, Dracophyllum densum, mountain cedar, mountain neinei, mountain toatoa, mountain and silver beech, pink pine, yellow-silver pine, southern rātā and small rimu. Among other plants there are wire rush, eyebright and ferns such as Gleichenia dicarpa, Gleichenia microphylla Leptopteris superba and Hymenophyllum rufescens.

Black-fronted terns and black-billed gulls nest in braided stretches of the river, especially near the Hinemoatū River. Great spotted kiwi (roa) live in the upper valley. Other birds include Australasian bittern (matuku hūrepo) long-tailed cuckoo (koekoeā), New Zealand falcon (kārearea), fernbird (kōtātā), New Zealand pipit (pihoihoi), rifleman (titipounamu), western weka kererū, tūī, korimako, riroriro, pīwakawaka, tauhou and morepork (ruru).

Speckled skinks (Oligosoma infrapunctatum) are rare in the upper part of the valley, but the most common of 8 species of lizard elsewhere in the valley.

Rhytida meesoni perampla snail, Leaf-veined slugs and many insects live in the valley, including the striped dung fly, Mycetophila fungus gnats, West Coast tree weta, Wellington tree weta, Kahurangi ground wētā, and Hakaharpalus and Kiwitrechus beetles. European wasps have become a problem in the beech forests since their spread in the 1970s, being known to kill and compete for food with lizards and other native species.

Bluegill bully, torrentfish, common bully and short-finned eels are in the river and streams. Salmon trout were introduced to the Buller in 1878 and trout in 1884.

Other introduced animals include stoats, red deer, goats, pigs and chamois. Rats were present when Europeans first explored the valley in 1846.

== Geology ==
Lake Rotoiti was created by a glacier and glacial moraines occupy a large area between the Buller and Gowan rivers. From the lake the Buller flows west through a gorge cut in granitic rocks of the Median Batholith. It then turns southwest to follow the axis of the Longford Syncline to Murchison. Tributary valleys around Murchison commonly follow north-south trending faults and fold axes.

The Buller&#x27;s deep gorges have been cut through the mountains as they have been raised by Quaternary faulting and folding. Some 350,000 years ago the river had wide floodplains, which remain as flat terraces above the narrow gorge, as at Manuka Flat, now roughly above the river. The Murchison Basin was filled between the Late Eocene and Early Miocene by sediments in increasingly shallow waters, indicating that the uplift of the area to the north began in the Early Miocene. It was particularly rapid during the late Miocene-Pliocene.

In the 1929 Murchison earthquake a landslide fell to dam the Buller at Fern Flat, about midway between Murchison and O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s Bridge. After two days the dam was washed away. The road between Murchison and Inangahua had 34 landslips, some up to wide. The road at White Creek, in the Upper Gorge, was split by a scarp. There were also slips in the 1968 Inangahua earthquake, one of which created a high dam in the river, just above Inangahua.

Above the Lower Gorge, podzol soils lie on sandstones of the Brunner Coal Measures. They are very infertile, acidic and tend to be very poorly drained. At high altitudes, the soils become skeletal and, in many places, unweathered rocks lie on the surface. Brunner Coal Measures are Eocene and were deposited in an estuary. There were coal mines near the Lower Gorge at Rahui (opened 1942) and Cascade (originally opened to improve mine drainage in 1897).

Gold is in quartz veins near Lyell, deposited by hydrothermal fluids, created by metamorphosis, about 420 million years ago.

Uranium was found in the Lower Gorge in 1955 and searches were made for viable deposits until the 1970s, but all were less than 0.1% U3O8. In 1972 the mountains on either side of the Gorge were officially named Mounts Cassin and Jacobsen, after the men who discovered the uranium.

== Tributaries ==
The Buller has several major tributaries. These include (in order from Lake Rotoiti) the Gowan River, the Matakitaki River, the Maruia River, and the Inangahua River. Other smaller tributaries include the Hinemoatū / Howard, Hope, Owen, Mangles, Matiri, Newton, Orikaka, Blackwater, Ohikaiti and Ohikanui Rivers.

In July 2001 the Buller Water Conservation Order came into force, listing the waters of the Buller River and tributaries that are to be retained in their natural state or protected because of the outstanding characteristics, features and values of the waters.

<text>Nowy Dwor Gdanski (; ; formerly ) is a town in Poland on the Tuja river in the Żuławy Wiślane region, capital of Nowy Dwór Gdański County, located in Pomeranian Voivodeship, with 10,171 inhabitants (2012).

==History==

The settlement was established in 1570. Initially owned by the Loitz family, it was later governed by the Wejher and Sobieski noble families, including King of Poland John III Sobieski. Administratively it was part of the Malbork Voivodeship within the Polish Crown. As a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772 it was annexed by the German state of Prussia. In 1920 it became part of the Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk).

On September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, causing World War II, the Germans murdered the local Polish customs inspector. The town was then annexed by Nazi Germany. During the war, a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp was operated by the Germans in the town. One of the places where the Germans used the forced labour of Stutthof prisoners was the train station, where there is now a memorial plaque. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in the war in 1945, the town again became part of Poland.

==Notable residents==
* Krzysztof Pilarz (born 1980), professional goalkeeper, (participated in over 250 games)
* Piotr Sierzputowski (born 1992), tennis coach

<text>In electrical engineering, the output impedance of an electrical network is the measure of the opposition to current flow (impedance), both static (resistance) and dynamic (reactance), into the load network being connected that is &quot;internal&quot; to the electrical source. The output impedance is a measure of the source&#x27;s propensity to drop in voltage when the load draws current, the source network being the portion of the network that transmits and the load network being the portion of the network that consumes.

Because of this the output impedance is sometimes referred to as the source impedance or internal impedance.

== Description ==
All devices and connections have non-zero resistance and reactance, and therefore no device can be a perfect source. The output impedance is often used to model the source&#x27;s response to current flow. Some portion of the device&#x27;s measured output impedance may not physically exist within the device; some are artifacts that are due to the chemical, thermodynamic, or mechanical properties of the source. This impedance can be imagined as an impedance in series with an ideal voltage source, or in parallel with an ideal current source (&quot;see&quot;: Series and parallel circuits). 

Sources are modeled as ideal sources (ideal meaning sources that always keep the desired value) combined with their output impedance. The output impedance is defined as this modeled and/or real impedance in series with an ideal voltage source. Mathematically, current and voltage sources can be converted to each other using Thévenin&#x27;s theorem and Norton&#x27;s theorem.

In the case of a nonlinear device, such as a transistor, the term &quot;output impedance&quot; usually refers to the effect upon a small-amplitude signal, and will vary with the bias point of the transistor, that is, with the direct current (DC) and voltage applied to the device.

== Measurement ==
The source resistance of a purely resistive device can be experimentally determined by increasingly loading the device until the voltage across the load (AC or DC) is one half of the open circuit voltage. At this point, the load resistance and internal resistance are equal. 

It can more accurately be described by keeping track of the voltage vs current curves for various loads, and calculating the resistance from Ohm&#x27;s law. (The internal resistance may not be the same for different types of loading or at different frequencies, especially in devices like chemical batteries.)

The generalized source impedance for a reactive (inductive or capacitive) source device is more complicated to determine, and is usually measured with specialized instruments, rather than taking many measurements by hand.

== Audio amplifiers ==
The real output impedance (ZS) of a power amplifier is usually less than 0.1 Ω, but this is rarely specified. Instead it is &quot;hidden&quot; within the damping factor parameter, which is:

: formula_1

Solving for &quot;Z&quot;S,

: formula_2

gives the small source impedance (output impedance) of the power amplifier. This can be calculated from the &quot;Z&quot;L of the loudspeaker (typically 2, 4, or 8 ohms) and the given value of the damping factor.

Generally in audio and hifi, the input impedance of components is several times (technically, more than 10) the output impedance of the device connected to them. This is called impedance bridging or voltage bridging.

In this case, &quot;Z&quot;L» &quot;Z&quot;S, (in practice:) &quot;DF&quot; &gt; 10

In video, RF, and other systems, impedances of inputs and outputs are the same. This is called impedance matching or a matched connection.

In this case, &quot;Z&quot;S = &quot;Z&quot;L, &quot;DF&quot; = 1/1 = 1 .

The actual output impedance for most devices is not the same as the rated output impedance. A power amplifier may have a rated impedance of 8 ohms, but the actual output impedance will vary depending on circuit conditions. The rated output impedance is the impedance into which the amplifier can deliver its maximum amount of power without failing.

== Batteries ==
Internal resistance is a concept that helps model the electrical consequences of the complex chemical reactions inside a battery. It is impossible to directly measure the internal resistance of a battery, but it can be calculated from current and voltage data measured from a circuit. When a load is applied to a battery, the internal resistance can be calculated from the following equations:
: formula_3

where
: formula_4 is the internal resistance of the battery
: formula_5 is the battery voltage without a load
: formula_6 is the battery voltage with a load
: formula_7 is the total resistance of the circuit
: formula_8 is the total current supplied by the battery

Internal resistance varies with the age of a battery, but for most commercial batteries the internal resistance is on the order of 1 ohm.

When there is a current through a cell, the measured e.m.f. is lower than when there is no current delivered by the cell. The reason for this is that part of the available energy of the cell is used up to drive charges through the cell. This energy is wasted by the so-called &quot;internal resistance&quot; of that cell. This wasted energy shows up as lost voltage. Internal resistance is formula_9.

<text>The Battle of Montgisard was fought between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Ayyubid Dynasty on 25 November 1177 at Montgisard, in the Levant between Ramla and Yibna. The 16-year-old Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, severely afflicted by leprosy, led outnumbered Christian forces against Saladin&#x27;s troops in what became one of the most notable engagements of the Crusades. The Muslim Army was quickly routed and pursued for twelve miles. Saladin fled back to Cairo, reaching the city on 8 December, with only a tenth of his army. Muslim historians considered Saladin&#x27;s defeat to be so severe that it was only redeemed by his victory ten years later at the battles of Cresson and Hattin and the Siege of Jerusalem in 1187. Saladin did defeat Baldwin IV in the Battle of Marj Ayyun and the Siege of Jacob’s Ford in 1179, only to be defeated by Baldwin again at the Battle of Belvoir Castle in 1182 and the Siege of Kerak in 1183.

==Background==
In 1177, King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, and Philip of Alsace who had recently arrived on pilgrimage, planned an alliance with the Byzantine Empire for a naval attack on Egypt; but none of these plans came to fruition. Instead, Philip decided to join Raymond III of Tripoli’s expedition to attack the Saracen stronghold of Harim in northern Syria. A large Crusader army, the Knights Hospitaller and many Knights Templar followed him. This left the Kingdom of Jerusalem with few troops to defend its various territories. Meanwhile, Saladin was planning his own invasion of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from Egypt. When he was informed of the expedition north, he wasted no time in organising a raid and invaded the Kingdom of Jerusalem with an army of some 21,000–26,000/30,000 men. Learning of Saladin&#x27;s plans, Baldwin IV left Jerusalem with, according to William of Tyre, only 375 Knights to attempt a defence at Ascalon, but Baldwin was stalled there by a detachment of troops sent by Saladin. Saladin left part of his army to besiege Gaza and a smaller force at Ascalon and marched northwards with the rest.

==Opposing forces==
The true numbers are impossible to estimate, since the Christian sources refer only to knights and give no account of the number of infantry and turcopoles, except that it is evident from the number of the dead and wounded that there must have been more men than the 375 Knights. It is also uncertain whether the so-called knights included mounted sergeants or squires, or whether they were true knights. One contemporary chronicler gave a strength of 7,000 for the Crusader army, while another contemporary estimate of 20,000 was probably a textual corruption of 10,000. However, modern historians generally deem the number of Frankish troops to have been lower; 80 Templars and 375 Knights for less than 500 armored heavy cavalry, as well as 2,500 to 4,000 infantry and archers (spearmen, swordsmen, axemen, crossbowmen and turcopoles), could explain why Saladin did not remotely believe such a tiny force of Christians should be considered a threat and marched at his leisure on Jerusalem, allowing his army to spread out across the countryside to pillage the Kingdom of Jerusalem&#x27;s farmlands.

Just as uncertain are the numbers of their opponents. An 1181 review listed Saladin&#x27;s Mamluk forces at 6,976 Ghulams and 1,553 Qaraghulams. However, there would have been additional soldiers available in Syria and elsewhere, while auxiliaries might have accompanied the Mamluks. William of Tyre reported Saladin&#x27;s strength as 26,000, while an anonymous chronicler estimated 12,000 Turkish and 9,000 Arab troops, which Stevenson calls &quot;greatly exaggerated&quot;. Accompanying Baldwin was Raynald de Châtillon, Lord of Oultrejordain, who had just been released from captivity in Aleppo in 1176. Raynald of Châtillon was a fierce enemy of Saladin and was King Baldwin&#x27;s second-in-command. Also with the army were Baldwin of Ibelin, his brother Balian, Reginald Grenier and Joscelin III of Edessa. Eudes de Saint-Amand, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, came with 80 Templar Knights. Another Templar force attempted to meet Baldwin IV at Ascalon, but they remained besieged at Gaza.

==Battle==
Saladin continued his march towards Jerusalem, believing that Baldwin IV wouldn&#x27;t follow him. He attacked Ramla, Lydda and Arsuf, but because Baldwin was supposedly not a danger, he allowed his army to be spread out over a large area, pillaging and foraging. However, unknown to Saladin, the forces he had left to subdue the King had been insufficient and now both Baldwin and the Templars were marching to intercept him before he reached Jerusalem.

The Christians, led by the King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, pursued the Muslims along the coast, finally catching their enemies at Mons Gisardi (Montgisard), near Ramla. The location is disputed, as Ramla was a large region that included the town under the same name. Malcolm Barber equates Mons Gisardi with the mound of Al-Safiya. Saladin&#x27;s chronicler Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani refers to the battle taking place by the mound of Al-Safiya, potentially modern Tell es-Safi near the village of Menehem, not far from Ashkelon, and within the contemporary Ramla province. Al-Safiya means white and, indeed, the Es-Safi hill is white with the foundations of a Crusader Castle recently found at the top, called Blanchegarde. Ibn al-Athīr, one of the Arab chroniclers, mentions that Saladin intended to lay siege to a Crusader Castle in the area. But Saladin&#x27;s baggage train had been apparently mired. There is a small stream north of Tell es-Safi bordering farmland that in November might have been plowed up and muddy enough to hinder the passage of the baggage train. The Egyptian chroniclers agree that the baggage had been delayed at a river crossing. Saladin was taken totally by surprise. His army was in disarray: part had been held up by the mired baggage train while another part of his force had scattered into raiding parties across the countryside. Saladin misread the danger and threat that Baldwin and his army was presenting to Saladin&#x27;s raiding forces. He mistakenly assumed that Baldwin was actually scared of Saladin&#x27;s army. The horses were tired from the long march. Some men had to hurry to collect their weapons from the baggage train. Saladin purposely left his baggage train in al-Arish so that his army would quickly move through Crusader territory. This would force his army to live off of the supplies and food that they had pillaged and taken from villagers. Saladin&#x27;s army, in a state of panic, scrambled to make battle lines against the enemy. King Baldwin IV ordered the relic of the True Cross to be raised in front of the troops. The King, whose teenage body was already ravaged by aggressive leprosy, was helped from his horse and dropped to his knees before the cross. He prayed to God for victory and rose to his feet to cheers from his men, who were moved by what they had just witnessed. Though Baldwin was very ill and could barely ride his horse, he decided it was too late to turn back and went into attack.

The Jerusalem army attacked the hurriedly arranged Muslims, inflicting heavy casualties. King Baldwin IV, fighting with bandaged hands to cover his sores, was in the thick of the fighting. Egyptian effective command was under Saladin&#x27;s nephew Taqi ad-Din. Taqi ad-Din apparently attacked while Saladin was putting his Mamluk guard together. As was hoped, Baldwin&#x27;s army caught a portion of Saladin&#x27;s army off guard. It turned out that Saladin himself led that section. Saladin called scouts to summon all the immediate sections for help. Then the sultan signalled for the start and deployment of battle. Taqi&#x27;s son Ahmad died in the early fighting. Saladin&#x27;s men were quickly overwhelmed. Saladin himself only avoided capture by escaping, as Ralph de Diceto claims, on a racing camel. By nightfall, those Egyptians that were with the Sultan had reached Caunetum Esturnellorum near the mound of Tell el-Hesi. This is about 25 miles from Ramla. It is only about 7 km from Tell es-Safi (al-Safiya).

King Baldwin pursued Saladin until nightfall, and then retired to Ascalon. Only a remnant of his army made it back to Egypt with him.

==Aftermath==
The cause of Saladin&#x27;s retreat and the Christian victory struck all Muslims. Some of Saladin&#x27;s parties even lied and said they had won the battle. Baldwin IV memorialized his victory by erecting a Benedictine monastery on the battlefield, dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria, whose feast day fell on the day of the battle. However, it was a difficult victory; Roger de Moulins, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, reported that men had been killed and 750 returned home wounded.

Meanwhile, Raymond III of Tripoli and Bohemund III of Antioch joined with Philip I of Alsace in a separate expedition against Harim in Syria; the siege of Harim lasted into 1178, and Saladin&#x27;s defeat at Montgisard prevented him from relieving his Syrian vassals. Saladin later captured Jerusalem after leprosy had killed King Baldwin IV.

==Fiction==
The Battle of Montgisard is alluded to in the 2005 movie &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, as a battle where King Baldwin IV defeated Saladin when he was sixteen. It was also described in the novel &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, written by Cecelia Holland.

An account of the battle is also given in Swedish author Jan Guillou&#x27;s novel &quot;Tempelriddaren&quot; (The Knight Templar) (), in which the protagonist, Arn Magnusson (de Gothia) is portrayed as a high-ranking member of the Knights Templar, commanding a contingent of the army at the battle of Montgisard. The battle is shown in the movie &quot;Arn – The Knight Templar&quot;, which was based on Guillou&#x27;s book.

<text>Karen Parfitt Hughes (born December 27, 1956) is the global vice chair of the public relations firm Burson-Marsteller. She served as the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs in the U.S. Department of State and as a counselor to President George W. Bush.

==Early life==
Born in Paris, France, Hughes is the daughter of American parents Patricia Rose (Scully) and Harold Parfitt, the last U.S. Governor of the Panama Canal Zone. After graduating from W. T. White High School in Dallas, Texas, Hughes earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Southern Methodist University in 1977 where she was a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority. She is of partial Irish and English descent.

==Early career==
Hughes worked as a television news reporter from 1977 to 1984. As a reporter, Hughes followed the 1980 presidential campaign. In 1984, she went to work as the Texas press coordinator for the Reagan-Bush campaign in the 1984 United States presidential election. She later became executive director of the Republican Party of Texas.

==White House==
Since 1994, Hughes has worked with George W. Bush, first as director of his campaign for the office of governor of Texas, and then as a from 2001 to 2002, while he was President of the United States.

Hughes left the Bush administration in July 2002 to return to Texas, but remained in daily contact with the Bush reelection campaign by telephone and e-mail, and spoke personally with Bush several times a week. In August 2004, Hughes returned to full-time service with the Bush campaign, setting up office on Air Force One, from where she planned the 2004 Republican National Convention and the late stages of the 2004 election. She has been praised by &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; as &quot;the most powerful woman ever to serve in the White House&quot;, and by ABC News as Bush&#x27;s &quot;most essential advisor.&quot;

==&quot;Ten Minutes from Normal&quot;==
In March 2004, Hughes published &quot;Ten Minutes from Normal&quot;, which includes an account of her decision to leave the White House. While promoting her book, she appeared on CNN on April 25, 2004 – the same day as the March for Women&#x27;s Lives – and said &quot;I think after September 11th the American people are valuing life more and realizing that we need policies to value the dignity and worth of every life. And President Bush has worked to say, let&#x27;s be reasonable, let&#x27;s work to value life, let&#x27;s try to reduce the number of abortions, let&#x27;s increase adoptions. And I think those are the kind of policies that the American people can support, particularly at a time when we&#x27;re facing an enemy, and really the fundamental difference between us and the terror network we fight is that we value every life. It&#x27;s the founding conviction of our country, that we&#x27;re endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, the right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;

==State Department==
On March 14, 2005, Bush announced his intention to nominate Hughes for the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy with the rank of ambassador — a job focused on changing foreigners&#x27; perceptions about America. The Senate confirmed her nomination in July 2005.
In her new capacity, Hughes spoke of improving the world&#x27;s perception of the United States via creation of a &quot;rapid-response unit&quot; and a plan to &quot;forward-deploy regional SWAT teams&quot;. During a town hall meeting on September 8, 2005, a State Department employee complained that &quot;recently, we&#x27;ve had tremendous amount of difficulty in some cases getting clearance for our ambassadors to speak.&quot; Hughes replied, &quot;If they make statements based on something I sent them, they&#x27;re not going to be called on the carpet.&quot;

At the end of her tenure in the State Department, Hughes said that one of her greatest accomplishments had been &quot;transforming public diplomacy and making it a national security priority central to everything we do in government&quot;. Hughes was the keynote speaker at the October 22, 2007, Public Relations Society of America&#x27;s International Conference and discussed, &quot;Waging Peace – The New Paradigm for Public Diplomacy.&quot;

==2005 tour of the Middle East==
Starting with a September 26, 2005, stop in Egypt, Hughes went on a &quot;listening tour&quot; of the Middle East to speak with leaders and people from the region. This was a response to growing fears in America about rampant anti-Americanism in the Middle East. Hughes was the third person chosen for this task by President Bush, following unsuccessful attempts by Charlotte Beers and Margaret Tutwiler. For her tour, Hughes asked two Citizen Ambassadors to accompany her: a Georgetown PhD student, Tina Kareema Dauod, and William O&#x27;Brien, a retired high school geography teacher.

On her September 27 stop in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, during a Q&amp;A with students in which a student shared her appreciation of women being allowed to drive in the United States, Karen Hughes acknowledged that every country has to chart its own course and choose what&#x27;s right for its own citizens, but also shared in the women&#x27;s sentiment about the United States. Another woman shared: &quot;The general image of the Arab woman is that she isn&#x27;t happy [...] Well, we&#x27;re all pretty happy.&quot;

In a press conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, Hughes incorrectly stated that Saddam Hussein &quot;had murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people using poison gas.&quot; Conventional sources attest that Saddam did order the deaths of several hundred thousand Iraqis during the al-Anfal Campaign and other violent suppressions, but casualties from his infamous gas attack on Halabja numbered in the thousands.

==Breast cancer research advocacy==
Hughes met business representatives from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to create the U.S.-U.A.E. Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research. It aims to develop breast cancer awareness campaigns and expand research in the Middle East by linking U.S. medical experts, fundraisers, health research activists, and businesses with their U.A.E. counterparts.

==Post White House==
In late October 2007, Hughes made it known that she would be resigning from her position in the Bush White House. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was quoted as saying she accepted the resignation &quot;with a great deal of sadness but also a great deal of happiness for what she has achieved.&quot;

Hughes is currently the global vice chair of Burson-Marsteller, a public relations company.

<text>Wallingford &amp; Crowmarsh Football Club is a football club based in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, England. They are currently members of the and play their home matches at The Hithercroft.

==History==
The club was founded in 1995 as the result of a merger of two local teams: the original Wallingford Town, a Hellenic League side at the time, founded in 1922, and neighbours Wallingford United, who had been founded in 1934. The newly merged club was named AFC Wallingford.

In 1997–98, the club became champions of the Chiltonian League, and gained promotion into the Combined Counties League.

In 2001–02, AFC Wallingford won the Combined Counties League championship comfortably, and then were runners-up to Withdean 2000 and AFC Wimbledon in the succeeding two years. However, the facilities at their ground, Hithercroft, did not meet the standards of the Isthmian League and thus they were denied further promotion. A Football Association grant of £100,000 was used to fund ground improvements which would make promotion possible if they were to again win the Combined Counties League.

However, after disruption caused by heavy player turnover (with several leaving for Didcot Town, who then won the FA Vase), the 2004–05 season saw AFC Wallingford unable to avoid last place and relegation. The 2005–06 season saw an upturn in fortunes for the club, with a runners-up finish in the Combined Counties League Division One, which resulted in a promotion and with it a switch to the Hellenic League Premier Division, a league deemed better suited to AFC Wallingford&#x27;s geographical location in Oxfordshire.

In 2011, Wallingford set up its first junior teams. During the close season of 2013, the club reverted to its former name, to become Wallingford Town AFC, as part of its bid to become more synonymous with and representative of the town itself and switched from the red and black kits of the past 40 years back to the original 1922 club colours of red and white stripes.

After numerous seasons in the North Berks League, the club was successful in their application to move into the non-league pyramid. In the 2016–17 season, the club resumed competing in the Hellenic League. Manager Mitchell moved into the vice chairman role and was replaced by Glenn Goudie. After three seasons of mid-table finishes, the club moved back to the Combined Counties League after the FA performed a re-structure of Step 5 and 6 leagues. Goudie stood down to take on the chairman&#x27;s role after COVID-19 halted the season and the club installed Lee Matthews as manager for the 2021–22 season. In May 2022, the club finished 3rd and earned a place in the play-offs. After defeating Rayners Lane 2–0 at home in the semi-final, the team won the final 2–1 after extra time defeating 2nd placed Hilltop. For the 2022–23 season, the club will compete in the Combined Counties Premier North.

In June 2022, Wallingford Town amalgamated with Crowmarsh Youth F.C. to become Wallingford and Crowmarsh F.C.

Wallingford Town play their home games at The Hithercroft at Wallingford Sports Park.

<text>The Sabine River is in the South Island of New Zealand. It is located in Nelson Lakes National Park.

There are two branches to the river—East Sabine and West Sabine. The West Sabine drains Lake Constance and the Blue Lake. The two branches join at the Sabine Forks, and flow into Lake Rotoroa. Apart from the upper reaches, which is open tussock and scrub, the river is set within unmodified beech forest. It is not a navigable river due to the rocky cascades along most of its length.

A tramping track runs along the river and forms the western branch of the Travers-Sabine tramping circuit. This route usually starts from Saint Arnaud at the northern end of Lake Rotoiti. It follows the course of the Travers River, goes up over the sub alpine Travers Saddle (1787 metres), and then descends along the East Sabine Valley and Sabine Valley to Lake Rotoroa. A track also ascends the West Sabine to Blue Lake. This route continues over the Waiau Pass, eventually connecting with the St James Walkway and Lewis Pass.

Three tramping huts are located in the Sabine Valley: Sabine Hut (on the shore of Lake Rotoroa, near the mouth of the Sabine); West Sabine Hut (near the Sabine Forks); and Blue Lake Hut.

==Ecology==
There is a diversity of flora and birdlife within the Sabine River Valley.

<text>The Chiltonian League was an English football league, existing from 1984 until its merger with the Hellenic League in 2000. While never having a defined place in the English football league system, successful clubs moved from the Chiltonian League to the Combined Counties League and to the South Midlands League.

==History==

=== 1984–1985 ===
The league originally consisted of a single section of 17 clubs, most of which had previously competed in the Wycombe &amp; District League.
=== 1985–1995 ===
After its inaugural season, the league expanded to two divisions (for first teams; reserve divisions were constituted separately). The divisions were originally known as Divisions One and Two, but after two seasons this was changed to Premier Division and Division One.

=== 1995–1999 ===
In 1995, the reserve divisions were scrapped and the league re-constituted into a single structure of three divisions – Premier Division, Division One and Division Two

=== 1999–2000 ===
With only six teams completing the 1998–99 Division Two season, that division was dropped and the league returned to a two-division structure. At the end of the 1999–2000 season, the league merged into an expanded Hellenic League.
