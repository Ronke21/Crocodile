<text>Lake Superior Provincial Park is one of the largest provincial parks in Ontario, covering about along the northeastern shores of Lake Superior between Sault Ste. Marie and Wawa in Algoma District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. Ontario Highway 17 (at this point part of the Trans-Canada Highway) now runs through the park. When the park was established by Ontario in 1944, there was no road access.

==History==
Traces of ancient volcanic activity can be seen in rock outcrops near Red Rock Lake and several other sites. For more than 2000 years, this was long an area of occupation by various cultures of indigenous peoples. The oldest artifacts found here date to approximately 500 BC.

At Agawa Rock, near the mouth of the Agawa River, there are pictographs created by the early Ojibwe people of this region. The figures are painted on the rock with a mixture of powdered hematite and animal fats and are estimated to be 150–400 years old. The records are visual representations of both historical events and legendary figures.

The first written description of these pictographs was published in 1851 by American ethnologist, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. As United States Indian agent in Sault Ste. Marie, he conducted extensive studies about the Ojibwe people, aided by his wife Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, who was half-Ojibwe and the daughter of a major fur trader in the city.
While the Ojibwe were forced to cede their lands to the Canadian government under an 1850 Treaty in exchange for reserves and annuities, they have preserved hunting and fishing rights to former territory. In the 1940s, the Lake Superior Provincial Park was established, and it took over an Ojibwe fishing village known as &quot;Nanabozhung&quot; within the boundaries.

From the late 20th century, the Batchewana First Nation, whose traditional territory included the village, also known as Gargantua Harbour, had long agitated to regain road access to the village. One of its reserves is Rankin Location 15D in Ontario and members have fished at Gargantua Harbour. In 2007 some 200 members, led by Chief Dean Sayers, restored a road to the village along a park trail, without a work permit. After trying to negotiate with the band, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) filed charges against it in 2008, saying that the First Nation had damaged park property.

The First Nation contended this was a traditional fishing and ceremonial area and construction of the road was necessary to exercise their Treaty rights. In March 2015 Justice Logan dismissed all but one of the eleven counts in the case. In his decision, Logan upheld that a Treaty right existed for the Batchewana First Nation to use Gargantua Harbour for commercial fishing and agreed that the road was necessary to get to the shore. He upheld one charge against Sayers and the Band for obstruction, requiring a fine to be paid.

==Climate==
Lake Superior Provincial Park has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) that is greatly moderated by its location on Lake Superior. Weather in the Park is highly variable depending on the location. Along the shore of Lake Superior, summer temperatures are significantly cooler than inland locations. During the winter, areas along Lake Superior are considerably milder than inland.

Winters in Lake Superior Provincial Park are very cold with significant snowfall. February is the coldest month in Lake Superior provincial Park with an average temperature of . Being located on the eastern shore of Lake Superior, snowfall is abundant during winter months. The park receives an average of annually.

Spring is a very short transition season in Lake Superior Provincial Park with snow often remaining on the ground into May.

Summers in Lake Superior Provincial Park are often cool due to the cold winds off Lake Superior. Summer is often slow to start due to the water on Lake Superior being so cold during May and June. During June and July, water temperatures are usually below and as a result fog is frequent. August is the warmest month with an average high of . August is when water temperatures on Lake Superior peak, with an average maximum of .

==Activities==

Recreational activities in the park include canoeing (especially in the interior lakes of the park), camping and hiking, fishing, swimming, boating, hunting, educational programs, wildlife viewing, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.

Hiking Trails
The 11 hiking trails located throughout the park can be accessed from Agawa Bay, Crescent Lake, or Rabbit Blanket Lake campgrounds, or from Highway 17. The Coastal Trail stretches and reveals the beautiful Lake Superior coastline. It is very demanding and can take between 5 and 7 days to complete. The Coastal Trail is part of the long-distance Voyageur Hiking Trail.

The 11 trails offer a wide variety of distances and difficulty from short half-hour hikes to multi-day trips. Orphan Lake Trail is a moderate difficulty trail that has a variety of terrain over an 8 km loop and takes approximately 2–4 hours to complete.

Pictographs
A short trail leads to the Agawa Rock Pictographs. They are located on a sheer rock face on Lake Superior. Several of the pictographs can be seen only from the water.

==Facilities==

===Park office===
The park office is located in the northern part of the park at Red Rock Lake. Senior staff, including the superintendent, can be reached at the park office between 9 am and 4 pm during summer months.

===Campgrounds===
====Agawa Bay====
Agawa Bay has 152 campsites. There are two comfort stations located in the campground equipped with showers, laundry facilities and flush toilets. An amphitheatre is located in the campground, and presentations here by park staff are a common occurrence in the summer months. All the campsites are within walking distance to Lake Superior. There is a premium for campsites located beside the beach. Permits are obtained at the Agawa Bay gatehouse. Firewood and ice is available for purchase at the Agawa Bay gatehouse.

Agawa Bay is also the location of the park&#x27;s visitor centre where information can be obtained about the park and surrounding areas. There are washrooms and a gift shop open to the public from May through September. The visitor centre has a display area orchestrating the history of the park and the influence that Lake Superior Park had on the fur trade, the Group of Seven artists and shipwrecks in the region. There are trailer storage opportunities available, but arrangements must be made with senior staff located in the northern part of the park at the park office. The visitor centre has received a number of awards for its design.

====Crescent Lake====
Crescent Lake (now closed) had 46 campsites and was located approximately 2 kilometres off of Highway 17 beside Crescent Lake.

====Rabbit Blanket Lake====
Rabbit Blanket Lake has 60 campsites. There is one comfort station located within the campground equipped with showers, laundry facilities and flush toilets. The campground is located beside Rabbit Blanket Lake. Firewood and ice can be purchased at the Rabbit Blanket gatehouse or the park office.

===Beaches===
====Agawa Bay Beach====
The Agawa Bay Beach is a 3 km long beach located at the Visitor Centre and the Agawa Bay Campground. This beach features an abrupt drop off and on wavy days, can have a dangerous undertow.

The water temperature here is usually cold, particularly in June and early July. By mid august, the lake has reached its peak surface temperature at around .

====Old Woman Bay====
Old Woman Bay is located in the Northern portion of the park. This beach has views of the nearby cliffs. The old Woman River also flows out into Lake Superior here. 
Old Woman Bay has the Nokomis trail, a 5 km loop that overlooks the Bay. The water temperature here is typically a few degrees colder than Agawa Bay.

====Katherine Cove====
Katherine Cove is one of the most popular beaches in Lake Superior Provincial Park. This beach is located around 15 km north of Agawa Bay and is very shallow. Due to being shallow, Katherine Cove is often warmer than most other beaches in Lake Superior Provincial Park.

====Bathtub Island====
Located 1 km south of Katherine Cove, this large sandy beach stretches to the mouth of the Sand River. 

Bathtub island is located around 50 meters offshore in the shallow water. This island features a pool in the rock that fills with waves and is then heated by the sun.

==Ecology==

===Forests===
Due to its size and location, the park lies in both the Eastern forest-boreal transition ecoregion and the Central Canadian Shield forests region. Its rugged landscape is wooded with a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees such as pine, maples and birch. Sugar maple dominates many forests in the southern two-thirds of the park.

=== Topography ===
The predominantly rocky coastline is interrupted by sandy beaches in a few locations. The park is situated within the Great Canadian Shield, dominated by exposed rocks or a thin layer of soil over rock.

===Fauna===
The park supports a large moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;) population. The best time for viewing moose is in the months of April, May, and June when the spring melt occurs. Other large animals found in the park include:
* White-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;)
* Black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;)
* Grey wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;)
During the summer months, the park provides habitat for warblers and other birds of the northern forests.

===Lakes and rivers===
In addition to its namesake, the park has numerous smaller lakes in its interior. A number of rivers also flow from the park&#x27;s interior:
* Agawa River
* Baldhead River
* Coldwater River
* Gargantua River
* Old Woman River
* Red Rock River
* Sand River
* Speckled Trout Creek
Several waterfalls on these rivers can be seen from the road or reached via hiking trails.

<doc id="651764" wikidata="Q1233795" url="?curid=651764" title="Memoirs of Hadrian">
<text>Memoirs of Hadrian () is a French-language novel by the Belgian-born French writer Marguerite Yourcenar about the life and death of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. First published in France in 1951, the book was a critical and commercial success. It was translated into English by Grace Frick and published as Hadrian&#x27;s Memoirs in 1954 by Farrar, Straus and Young and the following year in the UK as Memoirs of Hadrian (by Secker &amp; Warburg). American editions of this translation are now published under the latter title.

The book takes the form of a letter to Hadrian&#x27;s adoptive grandson and eventual successor &quot;Mark&quot; (Marcus Aurelius). The emperor meditates on military triumphs, love of poetry and music, philosophy, and his passion for his lover Antinous, all in a manner similar to Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;melancholy of the antique world.&quot;

Yourcenar noted in her postscript &quot;Carnet de note&quot; to the original edition, quoting Flaubert, that she had chosen Hadrian as the subject of the novel in part because he had lived at a time when the Roman gods were no longer believed in, but Christianity was not yet established. This intrigued her for what she saw as parallels to her own post-war European world. Although the historical Hadrian wrote an autobiography, it has been lost.

==Writing of the novel==
Yourcenar first thought of the idea for the book between 1924 and 1929. She then worked on various drafts intermittently between 1934 and 1937. The notion of writing the book from the point of view of a dying Hadrian occurred to her after reading a sentence in a draft from 1937 stating: &quot;I begin to discern the profile of my death.&quot;

She did not resume work on the book in earnest until December 1948, as she lived between New York and Hartford, Connecticut. She states that while she based her account of Hadrian on the two most principal sources, &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; and Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;Historia Romana&quot;, her goal was to reinterpret the past but also strive for historical authenticity.

==Synopsis==
The novel is told in the first person by Hadrian and is framed as a letter to Marcus Aurelius in the first chapter, Animula Vagula Blandula. The other chapters form a loose chronological narrative which he often breaks with various insights and recollections. The story begins with Hadrian, who is around sixty years of age, describing his incurable illness. He therefore wishes to recount important events in his life before his death.

His earliest memories are his boyhood years in Italica. He also talks of his early interest in astrology and his lifelong passion for the arts, culture, and philosophy of Greece; themes which he revisits throughout the book. He visits Athens to study, travels to Rome for the first time, and witnesses the accession of Trajan. He eventually joins the army and participates in the Dacian campaign. Hadrian, who is around thirty years old at the end of the war, describes his successes in the army and his relationship with Trajan who is initially cold towards him. He slowly gains Trajan&#x27;s favor and secures his position for the throne with the help of Plotina, the emperor&#x27;s wife, and also by marrying Sabina, Trajan&#x27;s grandniece.

During his military service, the outcome of the Sarmatian wars strongly affects him due to the appalling bloodshed and atrocities committed. He also begins to question the value of Trajan&#x27;s policy of military expansion. Trajan, in old age, begins an unsuccessful military campaign in Parthia after his successes over Dacia and Sarmatia. After a major defeat, Trajan hastily names Hadrian as his successor in a will shortly before his death. Following the death of Trajan, he hesitantly has his rivals executed and makes peace with Parthia. He travels frequently throughout the provinces of the Roman Empire while undertaking numerous economic and military reforms, promoting in his words: “humanitas, libertas, felicitas.” During a visit to Britain, he describes the construction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which represents part of his vision of curbing the military expansion of his predecessor and promoting peace.

Hadrian&#x27;s administration is a time of peace and happiness which he regards as his &quot;Age of Gold.&quot; He attributes this happiness to his love for Antinous, a beautiful Bithynian youth he meets in Nicomedia. He also feels genuinely loved by Antinous compared to the fleeting passions of his youth and the loveless relationship with his wife Sabina. While visiting Egypt, he despairs over the sudden and mysterious death of Antinous who drowns in the Nile. He ultimately believes that Antinous sacrificed himself in order to alter the outcome of troubling portents that both had witnessed earlier. In his grief, he devises the cult of Antinous and makes future plans to dedicate a new city to him in an effort to eternalize his memory.

Hadrian begins reflecting upon his advancing age and his change in temperament, recalling one incident where he accidentally blinds his secretary out of rage. Further troubling him is the outbreak of rebellion in Judea, which forces him to travel and take command of the troops. During an important siege, he despairs over the unraveling of his plans for peace, his ailing heart condition, and later over the rampant destruction in Judea. He states, &quot;Natura deficit, fortuna mutatur, deus omnia cernit. Nature fails us, fortune changes, a god beholds all things from on high…&quot;

During his final years in Rome and at his villa in Tibur, he ponders his succession and his thoughts turn to a memory of Marcus Aurelius as a virtuous and kind-hearted boy. Hadrian, now in advanced age and very poor health, begins to fear death and contemplates suicide through various means. He finally accepts his fate with resignation, or &quot;patientia&quot;, while reflecting on his newfound divine status throughout the Empire. Near death, he contemplates what the future may hold for the world, Rome, and for his soul.

<text>Robert Roy MacGregor (; 7 March 1671 – 28 December 1734) was a Jacobite Scottish outlaw, who later became a Scottish and Jacobite folk hero.

==Early life==

He was born in the Kingdom of Scotland at Glengyle, at the head of Loch Katrine, as recorded in the Church of Scotland baptismal register of Buchanan, Stirling. His parents were the local Clan MacGregor tacksman, Donald Glas MacGregor, and Margaret Campbell. He was also descended from the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch through his paternal grandmother. Seeing as the name MacGregor was outlawed, Rob Roy sometimes went by his mother&#x27;s name of Campbell.

In January 1693, at Corrie Arklet farm near Inversnaid, he married Mary MacGregor of Comar (1671–1745), who was born at Leny Farm, Strathyre. The couple had four sons: James Mor MacGregor (1695–1754), Ranald (1706–1786), Coll (died 1735) and Robert (1715–1754)—known as Robìn Òig or Young Rob. It has been argued that they also adopted a cousin named Duncan, but this is not certain.

==Jacobite risings==
Along with many Highland clansmen, at the age of eighteen Rob Roy MacGregor together with his father joined the Jacobite rising of 1689 led by John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee, and Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, to support the Stuart King James VII, whose flight from Britain following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 had been declared by the English Convention Parliament to be an abdication, then in Scotland the Convention of Estates adopted the Claim of Right and declared that James had forfeited the Scottish throne. Although victorious in initial battles, Dundee was killed at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, deflating the rising which then lost the Battle of Dunkeld. MacGregor&#x27;s father was taken to jail, where he was held on high treason charges for two years. MacGregor&#x27;s mother Margaret&#x27;s health failed during Donald&#x27;s time in prison. By the time Donald was finally released, his wife was dead.

Like many other Scottish clan chiefs during the 17th and 18th centuries, MacGregor operated an extralegal Watch over the cattle herds of the Lowland gentry in return for black mail (protection money), which was used to feed the families of his tenants and clansmen. Any cattle that were stolen from herds under his Watch were either retrieved or paid for in full.

MacGregor became a respected cattleman—this was a time when cattle raiding and protection rackets, selling protection against theft, were commonplace means of earning a living. MacGregor borrowed a large sum to increase his own cattle herd, but owing to the disappearance of his chief herder, who was entrusted with the money, MacGregor defaulted on his loan.
His principal creditor, James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose, then seized his lands. In a letter later circulated on his behalf and widely believed at the time, MacGregor alleged that Montrose had twice offered to forgive his debts in return for perjured testimony that would help to frame the Duke of Argyll for both high treason and Jacobitism. MacGregor further claimed that when he indignantly refused, he was branded an outlaw, and his wife and family were evicted from their house at Inversnaid, which was then burned down. MacGregor also claimed that John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl offered him a full pardon under the same terms, which he also indignantly refused. In retaliation, MacGregor waged a private blood feud against Montrose, both raiding his cattle and robbing his rents. 

Another version states that MacGregor&#x27;s estates of Craigrostan and Ardess were forfeited for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1715. The Duke of Montrose then acquired the property in 1720 by open purchase from the Commissioners of Enquiry.

==Glen Shira==
Despite having fought on opposing sides during the 1715 rising, MacGregor and his family moved immediately afterwards to Glen Shira, where they lived under the protection of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, also known as Red John of the Battles, &quot;Iain Ruaidh nan Cath&quot;. Argyll sought to negotiate an amnesty and protection for Rob. When MacGregor&#x27;s allegations about the reasons for his outlawry were made public by the Duke, it was widely believed, according to a surviving letter by a Church of Scotland minister, that Montrose and Atholl were both part of a plot by Argyll&#x27;s enemies in the House of Lords and at Court.

The Duke also granted him permission to build a house in the Glen for the surrendering up of weapons, &quot;Traditionally the story goes that Argyll only received a large cache of rusty old weapons.&quot; A sporran and dirk handle which belonged to Rob Roy may still be seen at Inveraray Castle. Rob Roy allegedly continued to use Glen Shira as a base for cattle raiding against the Montrose estates and despite repeated demands from the latter, Argyll refused to hand MacGregor over or otherwise curb his activities.

In July 1717, MacGregor and the whole of the Clan Gregor were specifically excluded from the benefits of the Indemnity Act 1717 which had the effect of pardoning all others who took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715.

MacGregor participated in the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719, in which a British Government army with allied Highlanders defeated a force of Jacobite Scots supported by the Spanish. Two of the Jacobite commanders, Lord George Murray and the 5th Earl of Seaforth, were badly wounded. Some accounts claim that Rob Roy himself was wounded, but the actual text of Ormonde&#x27;s account of the battle provides no evidence for this claim. Instead, it states that Seaforth was wounded: &quot;Finding himself hard-pressed, Lord Seaforth sent for further support. A reinforcement under Rob Roy went to his aid, but before it reached him the greater part of his men had given way, and he himself had been severely wounded in the arm.&quot;

Sometime around 1720 and after the heat of MacGregor’s involvement at the Battle of Glen Shiel had died down, Rob Roy moved to Monachyle Tuarach by Loch Doine. Sometime before 1722, he finally moved to Inverlochlarig Beag on the Braes of Balquhidder.

==Later life==

MacGregor&#x27;s feud against the Duke of Montrose continued until 1722, when he was forced to surrender. Later imprisoned, he was finally pardoned in 1727. He died in his house at Inverlochlarig Beg, Balquhidder, on 28 December 1734 after an illness brought on by old age and a bad winter, aged 63.

K. Macleay, M.D., in &quot;Historical Memoirs of Rob Roy and the Clan MacGregor&quot; quotes, &quot;but he had taken the resolution of becoming a Roman Catholic, and he accordingly left the lonely residence we have described, and returning to Perthshire, went to a Mr. Alexander Drummond, an old priest of that faith, who resided at Drummond Castle.&quot; Macleay takes the view that Rob did this out of sorrow for his crimes.

==Legacy==
Glengyle House, on the shore of Loch Katrine, dates back to the early 18th century, with a porch dated to 1707, and is built on the site of the 17th century stone cottage where Rob Roy is said to have been born. Since the 1930s, the Category B-listed building had been in the hands of successive water authorities, but was identified as surplus to requirements and put up for auction in November 2004, despite objections from the Scottish National Party.

The Rob Roy Way, a long distance footpath from Drymen to Pitlochry, was created in 2002 and named in Rob Roy&#x27;s honour.

Descendants of Rob Roy settled around McGregor, Iowa, United States, and in 1849 it was reported that the original MacGregor seal and signet was owned by Alex McGregor of Iowa. The Scots Gaelic clan seal was inscribed &quot;S&#x27; Rioghal Mo Dhream&quot; (&quot;Royal is my race&quot;). The signet was a bloodstone from Loch Lomond, and was sketched by William Williams.

In 1878, the football club Kirkintilloch Rob Roy was founded and named in his memory.

Early settlers to New Zealand named Roys Peak, Rob Roy Peak and Rob Roy Glacier in honour of Rob Roy MacGregor.

==In popular culture==

A fictionalised account of his life, &quot;The Highland Rogue&quot;, was published in 1723. Rob Roy became a legend in his own lifetime and George I was moved to issue a pardon for his crimes just as he was about to be transported to the colonies. The publication of &quot;Rob Roy&quot; by Sir Walter Scott in 1817 further added to his fame and fleshed out his biography. Hector Berlioz was inspired by the book to compose an overture. William Wordsworth wrote a poem called &quot;Rob Roy&#x27;s Grave&quot; during a visit to Scotland; the 1803 tour was documented by his sister Dorothy in &quot;Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland&quot; and the editor of the book changed the place of burial to the present location.

Adaptations of his story have also been told in film, including the silent film &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1922), the Walt Disney Productions film &quot;Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue&quot; (1953) and the 1995 film &quot;Rob Roy&quot; directed by Michael Caton-Jones (starring Liam Neeson as the title character and shot entirely on location in the Scottish Highlands). The 1995 &quot;Rob Roy&quot; film was also novelized in that year by Donald McFarlan (based on the screenplay by Alan Sharp) and adapted to a Nova abridged audiobook read by British actor Brian Cox, who also appeared in the film.

In 1894, a bartender at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City created the Rob Roy cocktail in honour of the premiere of &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, an operetta by composer Reginald De Koven and lyricist Harry B. Smith loosely based upon Robert Roy MacGregor.

In 2017, a new statue of Rob Roy was commissioned to be installed in Peterculter, Aberdeen. The sculptor appointed was David J. Mitchell, a graduate of Grays School of Art in Aberdeen. The statue was publicly unveiled at a ceremony on the bridge on 16 September 2017.

<text>The Age of Unreason is a series of four novels written by Gregory Keyes:

* &quot;Newton&#x27;s Cannon&quot; (1998), 
* &quot;A Calculus of Angels&quot; (1999), 
* &quot;Empire of Unreason&quot; (2000), 
* &quot;The Shadows of God&quot; (2001), 

Its title is a reference to Thomas Paine&#x27;s treatise &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;.
The story spans the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, with the action moving between England and France, later involving Russia, Austria, the Republic of Venice, and North America. The author makes use of pseudosciences (scientific alchemy instead of our physics) that were popular at the time: using affinity and aether, for example. Some historical characters appear in important roles: Isaac Newton, Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Cotton Mather, King Louis XIV of France, Emperor Peter the Great of Russia, King Charles XII of Sweden, and Edward Teach, better known as the pirate Blackbeard.

<text>In cricket, a crease is a white line painted or chalked on the field of play, that defines the area within which the batters and bowlers operate. The term &quot;crease&quot; may also be used to refer to the rectangular area enclosed by the lines. Law 7 of the Laws of Cricket governs the size and position of the crease markings, and defines the actual line as the back edge of the width of the marked line on the soil, i.e., the edge nearest to the wicket at that end.

Four creases (one popping crease, one bowling crease, and two return creases) are drawn at each end of the pitch, around the two sets of stumps. The bowling creases lie 22 yards (66 feet or 20.12 m) apart, and mark the ends of the pitch. For the fielding side, the crease defines whether there is a no-ball because the wicket-keeper has moved in front of the wicket before he is permitted to do so. In addition, historically part of the bowler&#x27;s back foot in the delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling crease to avoid a delivery being a no-ball. This rule was replaced by a requirement that the bowler&#x27;s front foot in the delivery stride must land with some part of it behind the popping crease (see below).

== History ==
The origin of creases is unsure but they were certainly in use by the beginning of the 18th century, being created by scratch marks, the popping crease being 46 inches in front of the wicket at each end of the pitch. In the course of time the scratches became cuts which were an inch deep and an inch wide. Such cuts were in use until the second half of the 19th century. Sometime during the early part of his career, Alfred Shaw suggested that the creases be made by lines of whitewash and this practice was gradually adopted during the 1870s.

==Crease lines==

===Popping crease===

The origin of the term &quot;popping crease&quot; is derived from the earlier feature of cricket pitches, the popping hole. One popping crease is drawn at each end of the pitch in front of each set of stumps. The popping crease is in front of and parallel to the bowling crease, and thus from the other popping crease. Although it is considered to have unlimited length (in other words, running across the entire field) the popping crease need only be marked to at least at right angles to, and on both sides of, the middle of the pitch. The popping creases are the edges of an area which is an &quot;unsafe zone&quot; for batsmen (they risk being out when they are in this area); the ball must travel through this area when initially bowled to the batsman.

====For the fielding side====
For the fielding team the popping crease is used as one test of whether the bowler has bowled a no-ball. To avoid a no-ball, some part of the bowler&#x27;s front foot in the delivery stride (that is, the first impression of stride when he/she releases the ball) must be behind the popping crease when it lands, although it does not have to be grounded. The foot may be on the line as long as some part of his/her foot is behind the line. This has given rise to the term &quot;the line belongs to the umpire.&quot; In addition, a no-ball is called if the bowled ball bounces more than once before it reaches the popping crease of the striker, or if more than two non-wicketkeeping fielders are behind that popping crease on the on side at the time of the delivery. There is no limit to how far a bowler may bowl behind the crease other than that he must be visible to the umpire sufficient for him to verify that the bowling is indeed legal.

====For the batting side====
For a batsman the popping crease – which can be referred to as the batting crease in the context of batting – determines whether they have been stumped or run out. This is described in Laws 29, 38, and 39 of the Laws of Cricket. For a run-out, the wicket near the popping crease must be put down when the batsman is not within their ground behind the popping crease. A 2010 amendment to Law 29 clarified the circumstance where the wicket is put down while a batsman has become fully airborne after having first made his ground; the batsman is regarded to not be out of his ground.

* If the batsman facing the bowler (the striker) steps out of his ground to play the ball but misses and the wicket-keeper takes the ball and puts down the wicket, then the striker is out &quot;stumped&quot;.
* If a fielder puts down either wicket whilst the batsmen are running between the wickets (or otherwise forward of the popping crease during the course of play), then the batsman nearer the ground of the downed wicket is out &quot;run out&quot;.

===Bowling crease===
Drawn parallel with the popping crease and four feet away from it. The bowling crease is the line through the centres of the three stumps at each end. It is long, with the stumps in the centre.

===Return crease===
Four return creases are drawn, one on each side of each set of stumps. The return creases lie perpendicular to the popping crease and the bowling crease, either side of and parallel to the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each return crease line starts at the popping crease but the other end is considered to be unlimited in length and need only be marked to a minimum of from the popping crease.

The return creases are primarily used to determine whether the bowler has bowled a no-ball. To avoid a no-ball, the bowler&#x27;s back foot in the delivery stride must land within and not touch the return crease. This is to stop the bowler from bowling at the batsmen from an unfair angle (i.e. diagonally).

==Using the crease==
Though the relatively small size of the crease is such that they limit the degree to which a batsman or a bowler can alter where they stand to face or deliver a ball, there is a degree of latitude afforded whereby both can move around the crease as long as they remain within the aforementioned confines. Batsmen &#x27;use the crease&#x27; when they move toward leg or off, before or while playing a shot. Bowlers &#x27;use the crease&#x27; by varying the position of their feet, relative to the stumps, at the moment of delivery. In so doing, they can alter the angle of delivery and the trajectory of the ball.

<text>Terence Aidan (Terry) Halpin (born 1950s) is an Australian computer scientist who is known for his formalization of the object–role modeling notation.

== Biography ==
Born in Australia, Halpin studied at the University of Queensland starting in the 1970s and eventually received a BSc, DipEd, BA, MLitStud and in 1989 a PhD with the thesis &quot;A logical analysis of information systems : static aspects of the data-oriented perspective&quot; under John Staples.

In the 1970s he started working at the University of Queensland at the Key Centre for Software Technology at the Department of Computer Science, which he combined with some work in industry on database modeling.

In the 1990s he moved to industry heading the database research at multiple software companies, including Visio Corporation. When this company was acquired by Microsoft he became Program Manager in Database Modeling, and worked on the &quot;conceptual and logical database modeling technology in Microsoft Visio for Enterprise Architects&quot;.

In the new millennium back in academia he was Professor at Neumont University, focusing on &quot;business rules approach to informatics&quot;. In 2009 he switched back to industry becoming a Principal Scientist at LogicBlox, and became a part-time Professor at INTI International University in Malaysia.

Halpin is a member of IFIP WG 8.1 (Design and Evaluation of Information Systems). He has been editor for multiple academic journals. And he several workshops and conferences on modeling both industry and academia.

== Work ==
Halpin&#x27;s research interest is in the field of &quot;conceptual modeling and conceptual query technology for information systems, using a business rules approach&quot;.

=== Object-role modeling ===
With his doctoral thesis Halpin (1989) formalized object-role modeling (ORM), a &quot;method for designing and querying database models at the conceptual level, where the application is described in terms easily understood by non-technical users&quot;.

== Publications ==
Halpin has authored several books and over 150 technical papers. A selection of books:

<doc id="651806" wikidata="Q166559" url="?curid=651806" title="HM Revenue and Customs">
<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs (commonly HM Revenue and Customs, or HMRC) is a non-ministerial department of the UK government responsible for the collection of taxes, the payment of some forms of state support, the administration of other regulatory regimes including the national minimum wage and the issuance of national insurance numbers. HMRC was formed by the merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise, which took effect on 18 April 2005. The department&#x27;s logo is the Tudor Crown enclosed within a circle.

==Departmental responsibilities==
The department is responsible for the administration and collection of direct taxes including Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Inheritance Tax (IHT), indirect taxes including Value Added Tax (VAT), excise duties and Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT), and environmental taxes such as Air Passenger Duty and the Climate Change Levy. Other aspects of the department&#x27;s responsibilities include National Insurance Contributions (NIC), the distribution of Child Benefit and some other forms of state support including the Child Trust Fund, payments of Tax Credits, enforcement of the National Minimum Wage, administering anti-money laundering registrations for Money Service Businesses and collection and publication of the trade-in-goods statistics. Responsibility for the protection of the UK&#x27;s borders passed to the UK Border Agency within the Home Office on 1 April 2008 and then to UK Border Force and the National Crime Agency in 2013; however, HMRC officers are also regularly deployed at the border to assist on operations.

HMRC is also a law enforcement agency, responsible for investigating and tackling tax fraud, excise (tobacco &amp; alcohol) fraud, smuggling, money laundering and a number of other types of offences against the Treasury. The criminal investigation department is at the head of its Customer Compliance Group, known as Fraud Investigation Service (FIS).

==Powers of officers==
HMRC has a strong cadre of criminal investigators responsible for investigating Serious Organised Fiscal Crime. This includes all of the previous Customs criminal work (other than drug trafficking, but used to include this up until 2008) such as tobacco, alcohol, and oils smuggling. They have aligned their previous Customs and Excise powers to tackle previous Inland Revenue criminal offences. Fraud Investigation Service are responsible for seizing (or preventing the loss of) billions of stolen pounds of HMG&#x27;s revenue. Their skills and resources include the full range of intrusive and covert surveillance and they are a senior partner in the Organised Crime Partnership Board.

HMRC&#x27;s criminal investigation department is Fraud Investigation Service (FIS). Officers deployed in their criminal investigation teams have the same powers as police officers, and have wide-ranging powers of arrest, entry, search and detention. HMRC have the power to apply for orders requiring information to be produced; apply for and execute search warrants; make arrests; search suspects and premises following arrest; and recover criminal assets through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. They also have extensive surveillance powers that authorised criminal investigation officers are trained to utilise.

The main power, under section 138 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (as amended by section 114 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) is to arrest anyone who has committed, or whom the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect has committed, any offence under the Customs and Excise Acts as well as related fraud offences.

On 30 June 2006, under the authority of the new Labour home secretary, John Reid, extensive new powers were given to HMRC. Under chairman Sir David Varney, a new Criminal Taxes Unit of senior tax investigators was created to target suspected fraudsters and criminal gangs. To disrupt and clamp down on criminal activity. This HMRC/CTU would pursue suspects in the same way the US Internal Revenue Service caught out Al Capone on tax evasion. These new powers included the ability to impose penalties without needing to prove the guilt of suspected criminals; extra powers to use sophisticated surveillance techniques, and for the first time, to have the same ability as customs officers to monitor suspects and arrest them. On 19 July 2006, the executive chairman of HMRC, Sir David Varney resigned.

HMRC is also listed under parts of the British government which contribute to intelligence collection, analysis and assessment. Their prosecution cases may be co-ordinated with the police or the Crown Prosecution Service.

== History ==
The merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs &amp; Excise was announced by then chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown in the budget on 17 March 2004. The name for the new department and its first executive chairman, David Varney, were announced on 9 May 2004. Varney joined the nascent department in September 2004, and staff started moving from Somerset House and New Kings Beam House into HMRC&#x27;s new headquarters building at 100 Parliament Street in Whitehall on 21 November 2004.

The planned new department was announced formally in the Queen&#x27;s Speech of 2004 and a bill, the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Bill, was introduced into the House of Commons on 24 September 2004, and received royal assent as the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 on 7 April 2005. The Act also creates a Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO) responsible for the prosecution of all Revenue and Customs cases.
The old Inland Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise departments had very different historical bases, internal cultures and legal powers. The merger was described by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; on 9 July 2004, as &quot;mating the C&amp;E terrier with the IR retriever&quot;. For an interim period officers of HMRC are empowered to use existing Inland Revenue powers in relation to matters within the remit of the old Inland Revenue (such as income tax, stamp duty and tax credits) and existing Customs powers in relation to matters within the remit of the old Customs &amp; Excise (such as value added tax and excise duties). However, a major review of the powers required by HMRC was announced at the time of the 2004 pre-budget report on 9 December 2004, covering the suitability of existing powers, new powers that might be required, and consolidating the existing compliance regimes for surcharges, interest, penalties and appeal, which may lead to a single, consolidated enforcement regime for all UK taxes, and a consultation document was published after the 2005 budget on 24 March 2005. Legislation to introduce new information and inspection powers was included in the Finance Act 2008 (Schedule 36). The new consolidated penalty regime was introduced via the Finance Act 2007 (Schedule 24).
As part of the spending review on 12 July 2004, Gordon Brown estimated that 12,500 jobs would be lost as result of the merger by March 2008, around 14% of the combined headcount of Customs (then around 23,000) and Inland Revenue (then around 68,000). In addition, 2,500 staff would be redeployed to &quot;front-line&quot; activities. Estimates suggested this may save around £300 million in staff costs, out of a total annual budget of £4 billion.
The total number of job losses included policy functions within the former Inland Revenue and Customs which moved into the Treasury, so that the Treasury became responsible for &quot;strategy and tax policy development&quot; and HMRC took responsibility for &quot;policy maintenance&quot;. In addition, certain investigatory functions moved to the new Serious Organised Crime Agency, as well as prosecutions moving to the new Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office.

A further programme of job cuts and office closures was announced on 16 November 2006. Whilst some of the offices closed were in bigger cities where other offices already exist, many were in local, rural areas, where there is no other HMRC presence. Initial proposals indicated that up to 200 offices would close and a further 12,500 jobs lost from 2008 to 2011. In May 2009, staff morale in HMRC was the lowest of 11 government departments surveyed.

In 2013, HMRC began to introduce an update to the PAYE system, which meant it would receive information on tax and employee earnings from employers each month, rather than at the end of a tax year. A trial of the new system began in April 2012, and all employers switched by October 2013.

In 2012, Revenue Scotland was formed and on 1 April 2015 it took HMRC responsibility to collect devolved taxes in Scotland. In 2015 Welsh Revenue Authority was formed and on 1 April 2018 it took HMRC responsibility to collect devolved taxes in Wales.

On 12 November 2015, HMRC proposed to replace local offices with 13 regional centres by 2027.

==Governance structure==
The board is composed of members of the executive committee and non-executive directors.

HMRC&#x27;s Criminal Investigators and Mobile Enforcement Officers deployed within Fraud Investigation Service are uniformed officers. HMRC Officers have the same powers as police officers, but their equivalent police ranks are at a higher grade (see table below):

==Performance==

HMRC collected £660 billion for the Treasury in 2018/19. It estimated that total theoretical tax liabilities in that year were £629 billion, but £31 billion was not collected due to the &quot;tax gap&quot;, made up of money lost to tax evasion, tax avoidance, error and unpaid tax debts. This equates to a collection rate of 95.3% (up from 92.7% in 2005-6). At the end of March 2009, HMRC was managing 20 million &#x27;open&#x27; cases (where the department&#x27;s systems identify discrepancies in taxpayer records or are unable to match a return to a record) which could affect around 4.5 million individuals who may have overpaid in total some £1.6 billion of tax and a further 1.5 million individuals who may have underpaid in total some £400 million of tax.

HMRC guidance notes that flexible arrangements can be made, where necessary, to assist individuals and businesses who have unpaid tax debts. Such &quot;Time to Pay arrangements&quot;, for example an agreed monthly payment schedule, are based on the debtor&#x27;s specific financial circumstances and the guidance notes that no &quot;standard&quot; Time to Pay arrangement exists. Interest is payable on a Time to Pay arrangement.

In 2007–08 HMRC overpaid tax credits to the value of £1 billion; at the end of March 2009, HMRC had £4.4 billion of overpayments to be recovered.

==Controversies==

===Child benefit records misplacement===

On 20 November 2007, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, announced that two discs that held the personal details of all families in the United Kingdom claiming child benefit had gone missing. This is thought to affect approximately 25 million individuals and 7.5 million families in the UK. The missing discs include personal details such as name, date of birth, National Insurance number, and bank details.

The then chancellor stated that there was no indication that the details had fallen into criminal hands; however, he urged people to monitor their bank accounts.

===IT problems===
EDS ran the Inland Revenue&#x27;s tax and National Insurance system
from 1994 to 2004. In 2003, the launch of a new tax credit system led to over-payments of £2 billion to over two million people. EDS later paid £71.25 million in compensation for the disaster. In 2004, the contract was awarded to Capgemini. This contract, also with Fujitsu and BT, was one of the biggest ever IT outsourcing contracts, at a value of £2.6 billion.

In February 2010, HMRC encountered problems following the implementation of their taxes modernisation program called Modernising Pay-as-you-Earn Processes for Customers (MPPC). The IT system was launched in June 2009 and its first real test came in a period known as annual coding. Annual coding issues certain codes to tax payers on a yearly basis. The annual coding process sent out incorrect tax coding notices to some taxpayers and their employers meaning that they would pay too much tax the following year.

===Underpayments to ethnic minority claimants===
In August 2010, seven HMRC staff were sacked for deliberately underpaying benefits to ethnic-minority claimants. Dave Hartnett, permanent secretary for tax at HMRC, said the department operates a zero-tolerance policy on racial discrimination.

===Goldman Sachs deal and surveillance of Osita Mba===

The whistleblower Osita Mba revealed to &quot;The Guardian&quot; that HMRC entered a deal with Goldman Sachs which allowed Goldman Sachs to escape paying £10 million interest on unpaid tax. Following this HMRC used powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) &quot;to examine the belongings, emails, internet search records and phone calls of their own solicitor, Osita Mba, and the phone records of his then wife&quot; to find if he had spoken to the investigations editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, David Leigh.

MPs in the House of Commons public accounts committee praised Osita Mba and called for scrutiny into HMRC&#x27;s use of RIPA powers in a report. The report said: &quot;We are deeply disappointed by HMRC&#x27;s handling of whistleblowers. We consider that HMRC&#x27;s use of powers reserved for tackling serious criminals against Mr Osita Mba was indefensible. HMRC told us that it had changed how it deals with whistleblowers and that it now provides information to its audit and risk committee who can use this to challenge how HMRC handles whistleblowers.&quot;

===Call waiting times===
In September 2015, a report from Citizens Advice highlighted frustration amongst callers to HMRC over long holding times. The report claimed that &quot;thousands&quot; of callers were waiting on average 47 minutes to have their call answered, often at considerable expense to the caller. HMRC alleged that the &quot;unscientific and out-of-date survey of tweets&quot; did &quot;not represent the real picture&quot; but said that 3000 extra staff had been taken on to respond to calls. A June 2015 report from the National Audit Office indicated that the total number of calls answered by HMRC fell from 79% in 2013–14, to 72.5% in 2014–15; however, a subsequent report in May 2016 suggested that performance improved following the recruitment drive.

=== EU Commission on UK Tax Exemption ===
In November 2024, HM Revenue and Customs began refunding several major British companies, including firms listed on the London Stock Exchange and ITV, following a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This decision reversed a previous European Commission ruling from 2019 that classified a UK tax exemption as illegal state aid, requiring HMRC to collect additional taxes.

The tax exemption, applicable from 2013 to 2018, was designed to support British-based multinationals by exempting certain overseas financing activities from controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. These rules generally prevent companies from reducing tax liabilities by shifting profits to foreign subsidiaries. The exemption, initially introduced by former UK Chancellor George Osborne, aimed to make the UK a more attractive headquarters for large international corporations.

The European Commission initially contended that this exemption provided undue benefits to British companies, constituting illegal state aid, and required the UK to collect back taxes. However, the final appeal in 2024 sided with the UK, allowing HMRC to refund the affected companies and marking a significant moment in the legal landscape for UK tax and state aid policy. 

==Revenue and Customs Digital Technology Services==
Revenue and Customs Digital Technology Services (RCDTS) is a subsidiary of HMRC established in 2015 to provide technical and digital services. The company works exclusively for HMRC and its employees are not civil servants. On 17 January 2022, HMRC announced its intention to wind up the company.

==Recent Investments==
HMRC has made a substantial investment of nearly £300 million to enhance its compliance and fraud investigation efforts. This funding has led to an increase in staffing within the Customer Compliance Group (CCG) and the Fraud Investigation Service (FIS). The CCG, responsible for enforcing tax compliance and addressing issues such as tax evasion, saw its workforce grow from 25,656 full-time equivalent staff (FTE) in November 2021 to a peak of 28,617 in October 2022, before stabilizing at 26,841 in October 2023. The FIS, which conducts both civil and criminal investigations into serious fraud cases, also experienced growth, increasing from 4,244 FTE in November 2021 to 4,956 by October 2022, although it slightly decreased to 4,735 by October 2023.
The financial commitment to the FIS is reflected in rising pay costs, which increased from £267.1 million in the 2021-2022 fiscal year to £288.8 million in 2022-2023, with an estimated expenditure of £286.2 million projected for 2023-2024. This investment underscores HMRC&#x27;s ongoing dedication to protecting public revenue and ensuring tax compliance across the UK.
Yves Laffont, Sector Lead for Financial Crime Consulting Services at FDM Group, noted that HMRC&#x27;s efforts serve as a model for businesses looking to strengthen their own fraud prevention teams. He emphasized the growing sophistication of fraudulent activities, including the use of artificial intelligence in scams. Laffont highlighted that fraud accounts for over 40% of recorded crimes in England but receives only 2% of police resources, which disproportionately affects vulnerable populations.
He further pointed out that tier 2 financial institutions are becoming prime targets for sophisticated criminal enterprises, posing risks to their customers. To combat these challenges effectively, Laffont advocates for rapid skill acquisition and holistic team development within organizations. He stresses the importance of establishing a risk management mindset and fostering adaptability to change as key components of successful fraud prevention strategies.

==HMRC and Fraud==
HMRC reports a significant increase in charity tax fraud cases across civil and criminal courts. The organization is actively working to improve systems that prevent fraudulent access to charitable tax reliefs, recognizing growing vulnerabilities in the nonprofit sector.
The rise in court cases highlights systemic challenges facing charitable organizations, particularly around financial management and compliance. Common issues include outdated financial records, incorrect documentation of authorized officials, and improper gift aid claim submissions. These administrative failures often lead to rejected tax returns and potential legal scrutiny.
Despite these challenges, the charity sector remains predominantly compliant. HMRC is taking proactive steps to support organizations by developing more interactive guidance, utilizing social media platforms, and creating clearer communication channels to help charities understand complex tax regulations.
Trustees of charitable organizations are strongly advised to seek professional financial guidance, especially when dealing with complex monetary matters. The increased legal actions serve as a warning to maintain rigorous financial controls and ensure accurate record-keeping.
The broader context suggests that while tax fraud in charities is a growing concern, HMRC&#x27;s approach is focused on education and prevention rather than purely punitive measures. The goal is to strengthen the integrity of the charitable sector and protect legitimate nonprofit activities from potential financial misconduct.

<doc id="651819" wikidata="Q291644" url="?curid=651819" title="Erna Solberg">
<text>Erna Solberg (; born 24 February 1961) is a Norwegian politician and the current Leader of the Opposition. She served as the prime minister of Norway from 2013 to 2021, and has been the leader of the Conservative Party since May 2004.

Solberg was first elected to the Storting in 1989, and served as Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in Bondevik&#x27;s Second Cabinet from 2001 to 2005. During her tenure, she oversaw the tightening of immigration policy and the preparation of a proposed reform of the administrative divisions of Norway. After the 2005 election, she chaired the Conservative Party parliamentary group until 2013. Solberg has emphasized the social and ideological basis of Conservative policies, though the party also has become visibly more pragmatic.

After winning the September 2013 election, Solberg became prime minister of Norway, the second woman to hold the position, after Gro Harlem Brundtland. Solberg&#x27;s Cabinet, often informally called the &quot;Blue-Blue Cabinet&quot;, was initially a two-party minority government consisting of the Conservative and Progress parties. The cabinet established a formalized cooperation with the Liberal and Christian Democratic parties in the Storting. The government was reelected in the 2017 election and was extended to include the Liberal Party in January 2018. This extended minority coalition is informally called the &quot;Blue-Green cabinet&quot;. In May 2018, Solberg surpassed Kåre Willoch to become the longest-serving prime minister of Norway from the Conservative Party. The government was further extended in January 2019 to include the Christian Democratic Party, and thereby secured a majority in Parliament. On 13 September 2021, following the parliamentary election which overturned her government&#x27;s majority in the Storting, she conceded defeat, leaving it to the Labour Party&#x27;s Jonas Gahr Støre to form a new government. On 12 October 2021, Solberg and her government tendered their resignations to King Harald V, clearing the way for Støre to form a new government, which was finalised two days later. She then returned to being the Leader of the Opposition.

==Early life and education==
Solberg was born 24 February 1961 in Bergen in western Norway and grew up in the affluent Kalfaret neighbourhood. Her father, Asbjørn Solberg (1925–1989), worked as a consultant in the Bergen Sporvei, and her mother, Inger Wenche Torgersen (1926–2016), was an office worker. Her parents are both executives. Solberg has two sisters, one older, one younger.

Solberg had some struggles at school, and at the age of 16 was diagnosed with dyslexia. She was nevertheless an active and talkative contributor in class. In her final year as a high-school student in 1979, she was elected to the board of the School Student Union of Norway, and in the same year led the national charity event Operasjon Dagsverk, in which students collected money for Jamaica.

In 1986, she graduated with her cand.mag. degree in sociology, political science, statistics and economics from the University of Bergen. In her final year, she led the Students&#x27; League of the Conservative Party in Bergen.

Since 1996 she has been married to Sindre Finnes, a businessman and former Conservative Party politician, with whom she has two children. The family has lived in both Bergen and Oslo.

==Early political career==
===Local government===
Solberg was a deputy member of Bergen city council in the periods 1979–1983 and 1987–1989, the last period on the executive committee. She chaired local and municipal chapters of the Young Conservatives and the Conservative Party.

===Parliamentarian===
She was first elected to the Storting (Norwegian Parliament) from Hordaland in 1989 and has been re-elected five times. She was also the leader of the national Conservative Women&#x27;s Association, from 1994 to 1998.

===Minister of Local Government and Regional Development===
From 2001 to 2005 Solberg served as the Minister of Local Government and Regional Development under Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik. Her alleged tough policies in this department, including a firm stance on asylum policy, earned her the nickname &quot;Jern-Erna&quot; (Norwegian for &quot;Iron Erna&quot;) in the media. 
In fact, numbers show that the Bondevik government, of 2001–2005, actually let in thousands more asylum seekers than the subsequent centre-left Red-Green government, of 2005–2009. In 2003, Solberg proposed introducing Islamic Sharia Councils in Norway after being informed of the existence of such councils in the United Kingdom, and, in 2004, said that she wished to increase immigration to Norway.

As Minister, Solberg instructed the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration to expel Mulla Krekar, being a danger to national security. Later, terrorism charges were filed against Krekar for a death threat he uttered in 2010 against Erna Solberg.

She had Mordechai Vanunu denied political asylum so as not to damage relations with Israel.

===Party Leader===
She served as deputy leader of the Conservative Party from 2002 to 2004 and, in 2004, she became the party leader.

After losing the 2009 elections, the party realised that a mere promise of tax cuts and a smaller role for the state would not convince voters. Solberg therefore abandoned her rhetoric that had earned her the nickname &quot;Iron Erna&quot; in the past and began to explain that a different approach was needed - instead of cuts, she wanted to reform, instead of dismantling the welfare state, she wanted to manage its structures more efficiently.

In 2011, she published a book called &quot;People, Not Billions&quot;, which could be better described as a new programme manifesto. She made regular visits to schools, health facilities and smaller municipalities, explaining to all that the goal was not to serve big business but to create conditions for the creation of new jobs, infrastructure development and economic restructuring. Solberg saw her long-term economic goal of moving Norway&#x27;s economy out of dependence on oil revenues as achievable through traditional right-wing methods of tax cuts, spending reductions and privatisation of state shares in companies. In addition, she promised to maintain free education and free health care.

==Prime Minister of Norway (2013–2021)==
 

Solberg became the head of government after winning the general election on 9 September 2013 and was appointed prime minister on 16 October 2013. Solberg is Norway&#x27;s second female prime minister after Gro Harlem Brundtland.

The Government was re-elected in 2017, making Solberg the country&#x27;s first conservative leader to win re-election since the 1980s. The centre-right parties were also able to maintain the majority in the Storting.

Erna Solberg has combined numerous national positions as Minister, Parliamentarian and regional politician with a strong commitment to global solutions for development, growth and conflict resolution.

She also negotiated with the Liberals to join the government in 2018. The Liberals officially joined the Solberg Cabinet on 17 January 2018. After the Christian Democrats alliance conflict that lasted from September to November 2018, they eventually negotiated to join the Solberg Cabinet on the grounds of a minor change in the abortion law, something that caused harsh backlash from the public and critics alike. The Christian Democrats officially joined the Cabinet on 22 January 2019.

She faced tensions between the components of her majority, leading to a break with the Progress Party.

She inherited the nickname &quot;Iron Erna&quot;, in reference to the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for her relentless management of the migration crisis in 2015, during which she had tightened reception conditions.

To cope with the fall in oil prices in March 2020, her government adopted a series of measures to support businesses, such as simplifying procedures for temporary layoffs of employees, and tax privileges.

===COVID-19 pandemic in Norway===
One day after her 60th birthday in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway, Solberg breached national health guidelines by going to a restaurant in Geilo with her husband and 13 family members to celebrate her birthday. The guidelines stated that restaurants only can hold 10 people of the same cohort. In March, she apologised for breaching guidelines and that she didn&#x27;t think of it properly before being questioned by NRK. She further stated that she should have known better. She was fined 20,000 NOK ($2,352) after a police investigation was conducted.

On 24 September 2021, her government announced a lift for all national major measures, taking effect the day after at 4:00pm, officially reopening the country.

===International engagements===
As Prime Minister, and former Chair of the Norwegian delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, she has championed transatlantic values and security.

In 2018 she assembled a global High Level Panel on sustainable ocean economy and introduced the topic at the G7 Summit. Her Government supports the World Bank&#x27;s PROBLUE initiative to prevent marine damage.

From 2016 the Prime Minister has co-chaired the UN Secretary General&#x27;s Advocacy group for the Sustainable Development Goals. Among the goals, she takes a particular interest in access to quality education for all, in particular girls and children in conflict areas. This was also central in her work as MDG Advocate from 2014 to 2016.

In one her many keynote speeches she stated that there is still a need for traditional aid and humanitarian assistance in marginalised and conflict-ridden areas of the world. The SDGs, however, take a holistic view of global development, and integrate economic, social and environmental factors.

Solberg has shown particular interest in gender issues, such as girl&#x27;s rights and education. Together with Graça Machel she has expressed the hope that in 2030 no factors such as poverty, gender and cultural beliefs will prevent any of today&#x27;s ambitious young girls from standing confidently on the world stage.

In 2016, she held a lecture at the International Institute for Strategic Studies The Global Goals in Singapore, addressing a road map to a Sustainable, Fair and More Peaceful Futurethe International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Solberg has secured significant financial support for the Global Partnership for Education and hosted the Global Finance Facility for women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s health pledging Conference in Oslo in November 2018. Her firm belief is that investment in education will accelerate progress on all other SDG goals.

In April 2017, she held a speech on globalization and development at Peking University in Beijing.

She was awarded the inaugural Global Citizen World Leader Award in 2018 for her international engagement.

In October 2019, she criticized the unilateral Turkish invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria, but dismissed calls for suspending Turkey from NATO.

In Solberg&#x27;s speech to the UN General Assembly in 2019 she advocated for Norway&#x27;s candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2021–2022. She upheld that UN needs to be strengthened and that the world needs strong multilateral cooperation and institutions to tackle global challenges such as climate change, cyber security and terrorism.

In May 2021, it was reported that Danish Defence Intelligence Service collaborated with National Security Agency to wiretap on fellow EU members and leaders, leading to wide backlash among EU countries and demands for explanation from Danish and American governments. Solberg said that, &quot;It&#x27;s unacceptable if countries which have close allied co-operation feel the need to spy on one another.&quot;

===Other news stories===
In April 2008, it was revealed that Solberg, as Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in 2004, had rejected a request for asylum in Norway by the Israeli nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu. While the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration had been prepared to grant Vanunu asylum, it was then decided that the application could not be accepted because Vanunu&#x27;s application had been made outside the borders of Norway. An unclassified document revealed that Solberg and the government considered that extraditing Vanunu from Israel could be seen as an action against Israel and thus unfitting to the Norwegian government&#x27;s traditional position as a friend of Israel and as a political player in the Middle East. Solberg rejected this criticism and defended her decision.

In 2014, she participated at the Agriculture and Food meeting which was held by Sylvi Listhaug where Minister of Transportation Ketil Solvik-Olsen and Minister of Climate and Environment Tine Sundtoft also were present. Later on, the four took a picture which appeared on the Government.no website on 14 March the same year. In April of the same year she criticized European Court over data retention which Telenor Group argued can be used without court proceedings.

In 2017, the Russian Embassy in Oslo had accused Norwegian officials and intelligence of using &quot;false and disconnected anti-Russian rhetoric&quot; and &quot;scaring Norway&#x27;s population&quot; about a &quot;mythical Russian threat&quot;. In response, Prime Minister Solberg said: &quot;This is an example of Russian propaganda that often comes when there&#x27;s a focus on security policy. There is nothing in this that&#x27;s new to us.&quot;

Solberg has tried to maintain and improve the China–Norway relations, which have been damaged since the Norwegian Nobel Committee decided to give the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010. In response to his death, caused by organ failure while in government custody on 13 July 2017, Solberg said: &quot;It is with deep grief that I received the news of Liu Xiaobo&#x27;s passing. Liu Xiaobo was for decades a central voice for human rights and China&#x27;s further development.&quot;

=== Defeat ===
In the 2021 election, center-left parties won the majority of seats and Solberg conceded defeat.

==Post premiership==
On 20 May 2022, it was announced that Solberg was becoming a board member of Global Citizen. Of her entry, she said: &quot;I say yes to this position because Global Citizen is perhaps the organization in the world that has the greatest potential to mobilize people, especially young people around the world, to fight poverty and achieve the UN&#x27;s sustainability goals&quot;.

On 13 November, Solberg announced that she would continue as leader of the Conservative Party and be their candidate for prime minister at the 2025 parliamentary election.

In the 2023 Norwegian local elections, the Conservatives won the most votes under Solberg. It was the first time since 1924 that the Labour Party failed to win the most votes in a national election.

===Husband&#x27;s stock trading controversy===
In the run up to the 2023 local elections, media outlets revealed that Solberg&#x27;s husband Sindre Finnes had been active in the stock market during Solberg&#x27;s premiership. She claimed to have been unaware of his purchases and had even declared herself impartial in dealing with companies Finnes had stocks in. A full list of the 3600 stock transactions in different companies were released on 15 September, four days after the election, when she also issued a public apology; while the National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime announced that they would consider grounds to open an investigation into the matter. On 3 November, they announced that they would not pursue an investigation into Finnes.

On 7 November 2023, she gave answers to questions during a hearing by the parliament&#x27;s Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs. On 21 November, the committee put forward further 12 questions. It is estimated that Finnes bought more 112 million Norwegian kroner in stocks while Solberg was a prime minister. The number of transactions, are estimates to be more than three thousand. Media reports indicated that Solberg had a conflict of interest, even if she did not know about every transaction.

On 26 November, &quot;E24&quot; reported that some of Solberg&#x27;s closest advisors at the Office of the Prime Minister did not archive, as required by law, &quot;central emails&quot; with Solberg&#x27;s husband - about her conflict-of-interest regarding his stock trading. The office&#x27;s knowledge of the affair and thereby the documents, were kept out of public for more than 10 years.

On 30 November, the Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs sent 13 more questions to the Office of the Prime Minister, which more specifically asks about record keeping.

<text>Generations of Winter (in Russian, Московская сага - Moskovskaya Saga) is a novel by the Russian writer Vasily Aksyonov.

Many critics have praised &quot;Generations of Winter&quot; as a new &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;-style, large-scale Russian novel, which tells the story of a Russian/Georgian family, the Gradovs, struggling to survive in the Stalin era.

As the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; put it: &quot;Aksyonov has ambitiously set out to challenge Tolstoy on his own ground, creating a gigantic historical novel on the grand pre-revolutionary model.&quot;

In late 2004 a television-series based on the novel premiered on Russian television. It has 22 episodes.

<doc id="651822" wikidata="Q1753242" url="?curid=651822" title="Orthographic map projection">
<text>Orthographic projection in cartography has been used since antiquity. Like the stereographic projection and gnomonic projection, orthographic projection is a perspective projection in which the sphere is projected onto a tangent plane or secant plane. The &quot;point of perspective&quot; for the orthographic projection is at infinite distance. It depicts a hemisphere of the globe as it appears from outer space, where the horizon is a great circle. The shapes and areas are distorted, particularly near the edges.

==History==
The orthographic projection has been known since antiquity, with its cartographic uses being well documented. Hipparchus used the projection in the 2nd century BC to determine the places of star-rise and star-set. In about 14 BC, Roman engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio used the projection to construct sundials and to compute sun positions.

Vitruvius also seems to have devised the term orthographic (from the Greek &quot;orthos&quot; (= “straight”) and graphē (= “drawing”)) for the projection. However, the name &quot;analemma&quot;, which also meant a sundial showing latitude and longitude, was the common name until François d&#x27;Aguilon of Antwerp promoted its present name in 1613.

The earliest surviving maps on the projection appear as crude woodcut drawings of terrestrial globes of 1509 (anonymous), 1533 and 1551 (Johannes Schöner), and 1524 and 1551 (Apian). A highly-refined map, designed by Renaissance polymath Albrecht Dürer and executed by Johannes Stabius, appeared in 1515.

Photographs of the Earth and other planets from spacecraft have inspired renewed interest in the orthographic projection in astronomy and planetary science.

The formulas for the spherical orthographic projection are derived using trigonometry. They are written in terms of longitude (&quot;λ&quot;) and latitude (&quot;φ&quot;) on the sphere. Define the radius of the sphere &quot;R&quot; and the &quot;center&quot; point (and origin) of the projection (&quot;λ&quot;0, &quot;φ&quot;0). The equations for the orthographic projection onto the (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) tangent plane reduce to the following:

:formula_1

Latitudes beyond the range of the map should be clipped by calculating the angular distance &quot;c&quot; from the &quot;center&quot; of the orthographic projection. This ensures that points on the opposite hemisphere are not plotted:

:formula_2.

The point should be clipped from the map if cos(&quot;c&quot;) is negative. That is, all points that are included in the mapping satisfy:
:formula_3.

The inverse formulas are given by:

:formula_4

where

:formula_5

For computation of the inverse formulas the use of the two-argument atan2 form of the inverse tangent function (as opposed to atan) is recommended. This ensures that the sign of the orthographic projection as written is correct in all quadrants.

The inverse formulas are particularly useful when trying to project a variable defined on a (&quot;λ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) grid onto a rectilinear grid in (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;). Direct application of the orthographic projection yields scattered points in (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), which creates problems for plotting and numerical integration. One solution is to start from the (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) projection plane and construct the image from the values defined in (&quot;λ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) by using the inverse formulas of the orthographic projection.

See References for an ellipsoidal version of the orthographic map projection.

==Orthographic projections onto cylinders==
In a wide sense, all projections with the point of perspective at infinity (and therefore parallel projecting lines) are considered as orthographic, regardless of the surface onto which they are projected. Such projections distort angles and areas close to the poles.

An example of an orthographic projection onto a cylinder is the Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection.

<text>Vasily Pavlovich Aksyonov (; August 20, 1932 – July 6, 2009) was a Soviet and Russian novelist. He became known in the West as the author of &quot;The Burn&quot; (&quot;Ожог&quot;, &quot;Ozhog&quot;, from 1975) and of &quot;Generations of Winter&quot; (&quot;Московская сага&quot;, &quot;Moskovskaya Saga&quot;, from 1992), a family saga following three generations of the Gradov family between 1925 and 1953.

==Early life==

Vasily Aksyonov was born to Pavel Aksyonov and Yevgenia Ginzburg in Kazan, USSR on August 20, 1932. His mother, Yevgenia Ginzburg, was a successful journalist and educator and his father, Pavel Aksyonov, had a high position in the administration of Kazan. Both parents &quot;were prominent communists.&quot; In 1937, however, both were arrested and tried for her alleged connection to Trotskyists. They were both sent to the Gulag and then into exile, and &quot;each served 18 years, but remarkably survived.&quot; &quot;Later, Yevgenia came to prominence as the author of a famous memoir, &quot;Into the Whirlwind&quot;, documenting the brutality of Stalinist repression.&quot;

Aksyonov remained in Kazan with his nanny and grandmother until the NKVD arrested him as a son of &quot;enemies of the people&quot;, and sent him to an orphanage without providing his family any information on his whereabouts. Aksyonov &quot;remained [there] until rescued in 1938 by his uncle, with whose family he stayed until his mother was released into exile, having served 10 years of forced labour.&quot; &quot;In 1947, Vasily joined her in exile in the notorious Magadan, Kolyma prison area, where he graduated from high school.&quot; Vasily&#x27;s half-brother Alexei (from Ginzburg&#x27;s first marriage to Dmitriy Fedorov) died from starvation in besieged Leningrad in 1941.

His parents, seeing that doctors had the best chance to survive in the camps, decided that Aksyonov should go into the medical profession. &quot;He therefore entered the Kazan University and graduated in 1956 from the First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Peterburg&quot; and worked as a doctor for the next 3 years. During his time as a medical student he came under surveillance by the MGB, who began to prepare a dossier against him. It is likely that he would have been arrested had the liberalisation that followed Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 not intervened.

==Career==

Reportedly, &quot;during the liberalisation that followed Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Aksyonov came into contact with the first Soviet countercultural movement of zoot-suited hipsters called &quot;stilyagi&quot; (the ones &#x27;with style&#x27;).&quot; As a result,
He fell in love with their slang, fashions, libertine lifestyles, dancing and especially their music. From this point on began his lifelong romance with jazz. Interest in his new milieu, western music, fashion and literature turned out to be life-changing for Aksyonov, who decided to dedicate himself to chronicling his times through literature. He remained a keen observer of youth, with its ever-changing styles, movements and trends. Like no other Soviet writer, he was attuned to the developments and changes in popular culture.
In 1956, he was &quot;discovered&quot; and heralded by the Soviet writer Valentin Kataev for his first publication, in the liberal magazine Youth. &quot;His first novel, &quot;Colleagues&quot; (1961), was based on his experiences as a doctor.&quot; &quot;His second, &quot;Ticket to the Stars&quot; (1961), depicting the life of Soviet youthful hipsters, made him an overnight celebrity.&quot;

In the 1960s Aksyonov was a frequent contributor to the popular &quot;Yunost&quot; (&quot;Youth&quot;) magazine and eventually became a staff writer. Aksyonov thus reportedly became &quot;a leading figure in the so-called &quot;youth prose&quot; movement and a darling of the Soviet liberal intelligentsia and their western supporters: his writings stood in marked contrast to the dreary, socialist-realist prose of the time.&quot; &quot;Aksyonov&#x27;s characters spoke in a natural way, using hip lingo, they went to bars and dance halls, had premarital sex, listened to jazz and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and hustled to score a pair of cool American shoes.&quot; &quot;There was a feeling of freshness and freedom about his writings, similar to the one emanating from black-market recordings of American jazz and pop.&quot; &quot;He soon became one of the informal leaders of the Shestidesyatniki—which translates roughly as &quot;the &#x27;60s generation&quot;—a group of young Soviets who resisted the Communist Party&#x27;s cultural and ideological restrictions.&quot; &quot;&#x27;It was amazing: We were being brought up robots, but we began to listen to jazz,&#x27; Aksyonov said in a 2007 documentary about him.&quot;

For all his hardship, Aksyonov, 

as a prose stylist, was at the opposite pole from Mr. Solzhenitsyn, becoming a symbol of youthful promise and embracing fashion and jazz rather than dwelling on the miseries of the gulag. Ultimately, however, he shared Mr. Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s fate of exile from the Soviet Union.

&quot;Solzhenitsyn is all about the imprisonment and trying to get out, and Aksyonov is the young person whose mother got out and he actually can live his life now,&quot; said Nina L. Khrushcheva, who is a granddaughter of Nikita Khrushchev and a friend of the Aksyonov family and who teaches international affairs at the New School in New York. &quot;It was important to have the Aksyonov light, that light of personal freedom and personal self-expression.&quot;
However, as Mark Yoffe notes in Aksyonov&#x27;s obituary, his &quot;open pro-Americanism and liberal values eventually led to problems with the KGB.&quot; &quot;And his involvement in 1979 with an independent magazine, &quot;Metropol&quot;, led to an open confrontation with the authorities.&quot; His next two celebrated dissident novels, &quot;The Burn&quot; and &quot;The Island of Crimea&quot;, could not be published in the USSR. &quot;The former explored the plight of intellectuals under communism and the latter was an imagining of what life might have been like had the white army staved off the Bolsheviks in 1917.&quot;

&quot;When &quot;The Burn&quot; was published in Italy in 1980, Aksyonov accepted an invitation for him and his wife Maya to leave Russia for the US.&quot; &quot;Soon afterwards, he was stripped of his Soviet citizenship, regaining it only 10 years later during Gorbachev&#x27;s perestroika.&quot;

&quot;Aksyonov spent the next 24 years in Washington, D.C., and Virginia, where he taught Russian Literature at George Mason University.&quot; &quot;He [also] taught literature at a number of [other] American universities, including USC and Goucher College in Maryland... [and] worked as a journalist for Radio Liberty.&quot;

&quot;He continued to write novels, among which was the ambitious &quot;Generations of Winter&quot; (1994), a multi-generational saga of Soviet life that became a successful Russian TV mini-series.&quot; The so-called &quot;&quot;The Moscow Saga,&quot; [this 1994] epic trilogy... described the lives of three generations of a Soviet family between the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953.&quot; The TV mini-series consisted of 24 episodes and was broadcast on Russian television in 2004. &quot;[In 1994], he also won the Russian Booker Prize, Russia&#x27;s top literary award, for his historical novel &quot;Voltairian Men and Women,&quot; about a meeting between the famous philosopher Voltaire and Empress Catherine II.&quot;
&quot;In 2004, he settled in Biarritz, France, and returned to the US less frequently, dividing his time between France and Moscow.&quot; His novel &quot;Moskva-kva-kva&quot; (2006) was published in the Moscow-based magazine &quot;Oktyabr&quot;.

&quot;Aksyonov was translated into numerous languages, and in Russia remained influential&quot;. In addition to writing novels, he is also known as the author of poems, occasionally performed as songs. He was reportedly &quot;forever a hipster [and] was used to being in the avant garde, be it in fashion or literary innovation.&quot; He was described as &quot;a colourful man, with his trademark moustache, elegant suits, expensive cars, and a love for grand cities, fine wine and good food.&quot;

On July 6, 2009, he died in Moscow at the age of 76. He is buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow.

==Political views==
Vasily Aksyonov was a convinced anti-totalitarian. On the presentation of one of his last novels, he stated: &quot;If in this country one starts erecting Stalin statues again, I have to reject my native land. Nothing else remains.&quot;

<text>Artscape Nordland () is an international art project that aims to bring art to people where they live, art museums being few and far apart in the sparsely populated county of Nordland. The first phase of the project lasted from 1992 until 1998. The project included 33 sculptures by 33 artists from 18 different countries placed in 32 municipalities in Nordland county plus 1 municipality in Troms county. Additional artwork was installed in 2009, 2010, and 2015, bringing the total to 36 sculptures installed.

The project has been celebrated by the composers Kari Beate Tandberg and Karsten Brustad who working together wrote «Skulpturlandskap Nordland – en musikalsk dialog» &quot;(&quot;Artscape Nordland: a musical dialogue&quot;)&quot;.

<text>Arturo &quot;Ka Turing&quot; Modesto Tolentino (September 19, 1910 – August 2, 2004) was a Filipino politician, lawyer, and diplomat who served as the Senate president and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. He was the vice-presidential running mate of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1986 Philippine election, which led to the ouster of Marcos in the People Power Revolution.

Tolentino helped write the Civil Code of the Philippines from 1948 to 1949 and authored the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act of 1960.

==Early career==
Arturo Modesto Tolentino was born in Manila. At UP Manila, he obtained an Associate in Arts as well as the Bachelor of Philosophy. He won a gold medal award as valedictorian at UP in 1938, and was valedictorian of the UP College of Law (1934). He later continued his studies and received the degrees of Master of Law and Doctor of Civil Law from the University of Santo Tomás. He was also a short story writer for the Philippines Free Press, and was a wrestler and bodybuilder.

As a debater and orator, he won seven gold medals (including the Quezon Medal) and two silver cups. He won the title of &quot;Inter-Collegiate Oratorical Champion of the Philippines&quot; in 1934. He successfully debated with American students from the University of Oregon in 1933 and from the University of Washington in 1934. In 1934, Tolentino also was the consort to the Miss Manila winner at the Manila Carnival. In UP, he was editor-in-chief of the Philippine Collegian and a fellow of the Upsilon Sigma Phi. Tolentino began practicing law after passing the bar in 1934.

==Early political career==

===House of Representatives (1949–1957)===
Tolentino was already a noted scholar and trial lawyer when he was selected in 1948 by President Manuel Roxas to be the youngest member of the Code Committee that would draft the first and only Civil Code of the Philippines, which was completed in late 1949 and took effect in 1950.
Tolentino was first elected as representative for Manila&#x27;s 3rd district in 1949; he was the first representative of the district following its establishment that year through the revised Manila city charter. He was re-elected in 1953. Shortly after his re-election, Tolentino was given the position of majority floor leader, which he held until his entry to the Senate four years later and one which, though less glamorous than that of speaker, he preferred and enjoyed.

===Senate (1957–1972)===
Tolentino was elected in the Senate in the 1957 election. He was re-elected in 1963 and in 1969. In 1966, shortly after Ferdinand Marcos was elected president, Tolentino was elected Senate president. A year later, however, he was ousted from his position.

==Vice presidential candidate (1986)==
Tolentino was chosen by Marcos as his vice-presidential running mate for the 1986 snap election. They were against the united opposition of Corazon Aquino and Salvador Laurel. According to the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL) final tally, Aquino and Laurel were consistently in the lead. The final tally showed Laurel winning by over 800,000 votes—roughly the same margin by which it showed Aquino defeating Marcos. However, according to the official COMELEC tally, Tolentino won over Laurel with a margin of approximately one million votes. He was ceremonially sworn in as Vice President of the Philippines on February 16, 1986, but functionally never took office. The disputed outcome would eventually lead to the People Power Revolution which ousted Marcos and installed Aquino as a revolutionary president. In 2013, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in its Resolution No. 2, series of 2013, officially stated that Tolentino was not elected as vice-president, consequently excluding him from the official roster of vice-presidents of the Philippines.

==1986 coup attempt==
After the People Power Revolution, Tolentino launched a failed coup attempt on July 6, 1986. He claimed that, since Marcos was in exile, he was constitutionally the acting president of the Philippines. Marcos allies and about 100 soldiers marched to the luxurious Manila Hotel, occupied it, and established a government. He expected massive support, but only several thousand of Marcos loyalists supported his cause, which dwindled to several hundred. On July 8, he agreed to surrender.

==Later life==
===Return to the Senate (1992–1995)===
In 1992, Tolentino successfully ran for the Senate, placing 18th as part of the Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition. However, his bid for re-election in 1995 was not successful, and he retired from politics. During this time he still took part in notable landmark cases including Tolentino v. Sec. of Finance.

===Death and legacy===
Tolentino died of a heart attack on the night of August 2, 2004, at the age of 93. He is buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.

Tolentino was once the foremost expert in civil law and persons throughout the 1960s to 1980s. The civil law volumes mainly used in the UP College of Law and other law universities are still the &quot;Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code of the Philippines&quot; volumes by Tolentino, a series of volumes published beginning circa 1960.

Sampaloc, Manila has a sports center named after the late senator and has a public monument of Tolentino along Instruccion Street.

==Personal life==
Tolentino&#x27;s first wife died during World War II. He then married Pilar Adorable, but had their marriage annulled due to differences in parenting. He later married Constancia Conde. Miriam Defensor Santiago considered Tolentino her mentor in the legal field and the Senate.

<doc id="651851" wikidata="Q6745056" url="?curid=651851" title="Malvern East, Victoria">
<text>Malvern East is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 13 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Stonnington local government area. Malvern East recorded a population of 22,296 at the 2021 census.

Malvern East is bounded to the north by Wattletree Road and Gardiners Creek, to the east by Warrigal Road, to the south by the Princes Highway (Dandenong Road) and to the west by Tooronga Road.

It is most famous for the Chadstone Shopping Centre, the largest shopping centre in the southern hemisphere, and the largest by total lettable space under one roof.

In recent times, what was once a relatively small suburb was extended to incorporate parts of neighbouring Chadstone. Based on its easterly proximity to Malvern, the expansion and redefinition of Malvern East was driven in the 1990s by resident groups eager to &#x27;reclaim&#x27; their address from being identified with the Chadstone Shopping Centre, which had been massively expanded since its original construction. However, the Chadstone Shopping Centre shares the &#x27;Malvern East&#x27; address and postcode.

==History==

The first Malvern East Post Office opened on 4 August 1914 by Mathew Renbach, who was raised in East Malvern and was renamed Wattletree Road twenty days later. The second Malvern East Post Office opened in 1924 and was renamed Central Park in 1928. The third Malvern East Post Office was renamed from Caulfield East in 1928, but reverted to that name in 1929. The fourth Malvern East Post Office opened around 1935 and closed in 1993.

Three Post Offices remain marking the major commercial areas of the suburb; Wattletree Road office on the corner of Tooronga Road, Central Park office on Burke Road near Wattletree Road and Darling South office on Waverley Road.

The suburb is also home to the Buddhist Society of Victoria, founded in 1953, making it the oldest Buddhist Institution in Victoria.

==Parks and gardens==

Malvern East has a number of popular public open spaces, the most notable of which are Hedgeley Dene Gardens, Central Park and the Urban Forest Reserve. While Central Park and its surrounding residential neighbourhood are subject to heritage protection, Hedgeley Dene Gardens is the first public open space to be designated worthy of protection on neighbourhood character grounds.

==Transport==
Malvern East is serviced by Darling, East Malvern and Holmesglen railway stations, all on the Glen Waverley line, Caulfield and Malvern railway stations on the Frankston line, Cranbourne line and Pakenham line and the numbers 3 and 5 tram routes.

The Melbourne bus routes 612, 623, 624, and 626 also service the area.

The suburb is also serviced by the community bike path along Gardiners Creek, which joins and is an integral part, of the Greater Melbourne network of bike paths.

==Sport==

The suburb has an Australian Rules football team, East Malvern Football Club, competing in the Southern Football League. The De La Salle Old Collegians Associated Football Club also competes at Waverley Park, on Waverley Road, in the Victorian Amateur Football Association in A Section.

Malvern East also boasts one of the largest Australian Rules Auskick clinics in Australia, which is held on Saturday mornings during winter.

Golfers play at the course of the East Malvern Golf Club, on Golfers Drive, the Malvern Valley Public Golf Course on Golfers Drive or at the course of the Nepean Golf Club, on Waverley Road.

==Notable citizens==
* Bruce Clarke (1925–2008), jazz guitarist, composer, and educator, lived in Malvern East

<text>The landing at Cape Helles () was part of the Gallipoli campaign, the amphibious landings on the Gallipoli peninsula by British and French forces on 25 April 1915 during the First World War. Helles, at the foot of the peninsula, was the main landing area. With gunfire support from the Royal Navy, the 29th Division was to advance along the peninsula on the first day and seize the heights of Achi Baba. The British then planned to capture the forts that guarded the straits of the Dardanelles.

A feigned landing at Bulair by the Royal Naval Division and a real landing at Anzac Cove were made to the north at Gaba Tepe, by the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, before dawn; a diversionary landing was made by French forces at Kum Kale on the Asiatic shore of the Straits. After dark, another demonstration was made by the French in Besika Bay.

The Helles landing was mismanaged by the British commander, Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston. V and W beaches became bloodbaths, despite the meagre defences, while the easy landings at other sites were not exploited. Although the British managed to gain a foothold, their plans were in disarray. For two months, the British fought costly battles to reach their first day objectives but they were eventually defeated by the Ottoman defenders.

==Background==
===Ottoman developments===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire was called the sick man of Europe; weakened by political instability, military defeat and civil strife following a century of decline. Power had been seized in 1908 by a group of young officers, known as the Young Turks, who installed Mehmed V as a figurehead Sultan. The new regime implemented a program of reform to modernise the political and economic system and redefine the national character of the empire. Germany provided significant investment and its diplomats gained more influence at British expense, previously the predominant power in the region and German officers assisted in training and re-equipping the army. Despite this support, the economic resources of the empire were depleted by the cost of the First and Second Balkan Wars and the French, British and Germans offered financial aid. A pro-German faction influenced by Enver Pasha, the former Ottoman military attaché in Berlin, opposed the pro-British majority in the Ottoman cabinet and tried to secure closer relations with Germany. In December 1913, the Germans sent a military mission to Constantinople, headed by General Otto Liman von Sanders. The geographic position of the Ottoman Empire meant that its neutrality in the event of a European war was of significant interest to Russia, France and Britain.

During the July Crisis in 1914, German diplomats offered an anti-Russian alliance and territorial gains in Caucasia, north-west Iran and Trans-Caspia. The pro-British faction in the Cabinet was isolated, due to the British ambassador taking leave until 18 August. As the crisis deepened in Europe, Ottoman policy was to obtain a guarantee of territorial integrity and potential advantages, unaware that the British might enter a European war. On 30 July 1914, two days after the outbreak of the war in Europe, the Ottoman leaders agreed to form the Ottoman-German Alliance in secret against Russia, although it did not require them to undertake military action. On 2 August, the British requisitioned two modern battleships, and which were being built for the Ottoman Navy in British shipyards, alienating supporters of the British in Constantinople, despite the offer of compensation if they remained neutral. During the strained diplomatic relations between the two empires, the German government offered two cruisers, and to the Ottoman navy as replacements. The Allies conducted the Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau which escaped, when the Ottoman government opened the Dardanelles to allow them to sail to Constantinople, despite being required under international law, as a neutral party, to block military shipping.

In September, the British naval mission to the Ottomans, which had been established in 1912 under Admiral Arthur Limpus, was recalled as it appeared that the Ottomans would soon enter the war and command of the Ottoman navy was taken over by Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon of the Imperial German Navy. On 27 September, the German commander of the Dardanelles fortifications unilaterally ordered the passage to be closed, adding to the impression that the Ottomans were pro-German. The German naval presence and the success of German armies in Europe, gave the pro-German faction in the Ottoman government enough influence to declare war on Russia. On 27 October, &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;, having been renamed &quot;Yavûz Sultân Selîm&quot; and &quot;Midilli&quot;, sortied into the Black Sea, bombarded the port of Odessa and sank several Russian ships. The Ottomans refused an Allied demand to expel the German missions and on 31 October 1914, formally entered the war on the side of the Central Powers. Russia declared war on Turkey on 2 November, the next day the British ambassador left Constantinople and a British naval squadron off the Dardanelles bombarded the outer forts at Kum Kale and Seddulbahir. A shell hit a magazine, knocked the guns off their mounts and killed Britain and France declared war on 5 November and the Ottomans declared a &quot;jihad&quot; (holy war) later that month, beginning the Caucasus Campaign against the Russians, to regain former Turkish provinces. Fighting also began in Mesopotamia, following a British landing to occupy the oil facilities in the Persian Gulf. The Ottomans prepared to attack Egypt in early 1915, to occupy the Suez Canal and cut the Mediterranean route to British India and the Far East.

===Allied strategy and the Dardanelles===

By late 1914, the race to the sea in France, a war of manoeuvre, had ended and trench lines had been dug from the Swiss border to the English Channel. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary closed the overland trade routes between Britain and France in the west and Russia in the east. The White Sea in the Arctic and the Sea of Okhotsk in the Far East, were icebound in winter and distant from the Eastern Front. The Baltic Sea was blockaded by the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; (Imperial German Navy) and the entrance to the Black Sea through the Dardanelles was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. While the empire remained neutral, trade with Russia continued but the straits were closed before the Ottomans went to war and in November mine laying was begun in the waterway.

Aristide Briand made a proposal in November, to attack the Ottoman Empire, which was rejected and an attempt by the British to pay the Ottomans to join the Allied side also failed. Later that month, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed a naval attack on the Dardanelles, based in part on erroneous reports of Ottoman troop strength. Churchill wanted to use a large number of obsolete battleships, which could not operate against the German High Seas Fleet, for an operation against the Dardanelles, with a small occupation force provided by the army. It was hoped that an attack on the Ottomans would also draw the former Ottoman territories of Bulgaria and Greece into the war, on the Allied side. On 2 January 1915, Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia appealed to Britain for assistance against the Ottomans, who were conducting an offensive in the Caucasus. Planning began for a naval demonstration in the Dardanelles to divert troops from the Caucasian theatre.

==Prelude==

===Ottoman defensive preparations===
The naval operations in the Dardanelles ended with the failure on 18 March, to push a naval force through the straits, during which three battleships were sunk and four capital ships were severely damaged by naval mines laid along the Asiatic shore. Preparations began for a landing to help the navy neutralise the forts and batteries guarding the straits but the preparations in Egypt were not concealed, the French commander even spoke of it in an interview with an Alexandria newspaper. On 24 March, Enver Pasha the Ottoman Minister of War unified the military forces around the Dardanelles, under the command of Marshal Otto Liman von Sanders and the Fifth Army headquarters. On arrival at Gallipoli, Liman ordered that the garrisons in the peninsula be concentrated and the 5th and 7th divisions were moved to Bulair. The 9th Division was deployed in the southern part of the peninsula, from Suvla Bay to Sedd el Bahr and the 11th Division garrisoned the Asiatic shore (the 3rd Division was sent later as a reinforcement). Near Boghali, the 19th Division was stationed as a reserve, under the command of the 5th Army headquarters, ready to move to Bulair, Gaba Tepe or the Asiatic side according to developments.

Liman emphasised a policy of mobile defence by the divisions in the three defensive areas, rather than persist with the attempt to guard the coast with continuous defences and the redeployment was carried out by night, to evade scrutiny by Allied reconnaissance aircraft. The 9th Division under Colonel Halil Sami Bey, deployed its forces according to the new defence scheme, creating a northern zone from the mouth of Aghyl Dere, north of Ari Burnu to Semerly Tepe, occupied by the 27th Regiment and some mountain artillery and a southern zone from Semerly Tepe to Sedd el Bahr, garrisoned by the 26th Regiment. The 25th Regiment was placed in reserve on the Kilid Bahr plateau near Serafim Farm, able to intervene in either zone. In the northern defence zone, the 27th Regiment commander Lieutenant-Colonel Ali Chefik Bey put the 2nd Battalion on the coast, with two guns at Gaba Tepe and two guns further inland; the 1st and 3rd battalions were held in reserve near Maidos (until bombed on 23 April, after which they were moved to an area within of Gaba Tepe). In the southern defence zone, Lieutenant-Colonel Kadri Bey the 26th Regiment commander, created three battalion areas, a northern or &quot;Kum Tepe sector&quot; from Semerly Tepe to Sari Tepe occupied by the 1st Battalion, with three companies supported by a field battery on the coast and a company in reserve, with two guns south of Gaba Tepe.

In the central &quot;Krithia sector&quot;, the 2nd Battalion covered the area from Sari Tepe, to the mouth of Gully Ravine and from Sedd el Bahr to the mouth of Tenkir Dere. One company was placed on the Aegean coast and one near Morto Bay, the other two were put in reserve at Kanli Dere, south-east of Krithia at the regimental headquarters. On the west bank of Kereves Dere, a battery of howitzers commanded the Straits. The southern &quot;Sedd el Bahr sector&quot;, ran from Gully Beach to Sedd el Bahr and was garrisoned by the 3rd Battalion and a company of engineers which were working on the beach defences. One company guarded W Beach, a company was placed at Sedd el Bahr with four Maxim guns on high ground overlooking V Beach and two companies were in reserve on low ground north-west of Morto Bay; twelve men watched X Beach. At the three beaches where the British were to make large landings, there were two infantry companies and with two infantry and one engineer company in reserve. On the Asiatic shore, the 3rd Division had two regiments near Troy and one from Kum Kale to Yeni Shehr; the 11th Division lay in reserve near Ezine, with detachments on either side of Besika Bay.

===Allied plan===
The purpose of the military operation was to assist the fleet to force the Straits, by taking from the rear the Ottoman forts on the European side of the Narrows and to obtain a vantage point, from which the forts on the Asiatic side could be dominated. The objective was the Kilitbahir plateau which covered the Ottoman forts in the Narrows and which ran in a semicircle most of the width of the peninsula, between Maidos and Soghanli Dere. The plateau ran from Kilitbahir westwards for about was about wide at its broadest point and high. The Ottomans had entrenched and wired the plateau and extended the fortifications south to Kakma Dagh ridge on the Straits and north to Gaba Tepe, forming a defensive line where the peninsula was wide and which dominated the Kilia plain to the south-west.

General Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the MEF chose to make two landings with two diversions. The Anzac Corps would make a surprise landing between Gaba Tepe and Fisherman&#x27;s Hut, with the covering force landing just before dawn, with no preliminary bombardment. After consolidating the left flank the force was to advance eastwards towards Maidos to cut Ottoman communications with the garrisons further south. On the Gallipoli peninsula on either side of Cape Helles, where the navy could provide support from three sides a covering force of the 86th Brigade and additional units would land and secure the beaches, then the main force would follow up and advance to the first day objectives, the village of Krithia and the hill of Achi Baba. Five beaches were selected for the landing, from east (inside the straits) to west (on the Aegean coast), S, V, W, X and Y beaches. V and W beaches were the main landings at the tip of the peninsula, either side of Cape Helles.

To the north of the Anzac landings a diversion was to be mounted at Bulair. The Royal Naval Division (RND) less two battalions, was to make a demonstration at the narrowest point of the peninsula, to induce the Ottomans to retain forces in the area during the main landings. A naval covering force would bombard the Bulair defences all day and one ship would make a close reconnaissance, with the transports visible in the background. To the south of the landings around Cape Helles, on the Asiatic shore at Kum Kale, a French regiment of the &quot;Corps expéditionnaire d&#x27;Orient&quot; would land temporarily at the same time as the 29th Division at Cape Helles, to distract Ottoman artillery on the Asiatic shore, confuse the Ottoman command and delay the dispatch of reinforcements from the Asia to Gallipoli, before withdrawing to join the main landings on the peninsula. Despite the assurance of a 1905 Admiralty report, that water was plentiful in the valleys, extensive preparations were made to maintain an adequate water supply. In April the Indian 9th Mule Corps arrived from France with and and in Egypt a Zion Mule Corps was formed from Jewish Russian émigrés from Palestine. The need for means to carry water was considered so urgent that in mid-April, a request was forwarded to Egypt for the Zion Mule Corps to be sent immediately, regardless of its lack of equipment.

==Battle==

===Air operations===
The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) aircraft of , co-operated with the Anzac landing with seaplanes and a kite balloon; Number 3 Aeroplane Squadron RNAS, with 18 aircraft, flew in support of the operation at Helles. Standing patrols were maintained over Helles and the Asiatic coast, in perfect flying weather, each pilot making three sorties during the day, beginning at dawn. As soon as Ottoman artillery replied to the landings, the aircraft observers used wireless to direct naval gunfire but were ignored because the quantity of naval gunnery was overwhelmed by the number of Ottoman targets. Once the troops were established ashore, the ships responded to messages from the aircrews who used flare guns to signal to ships unable to receive wireless transmissions. The flyers began bombing artillery, camps and troops, conducted photographic reconnaissance and kept watch on the peninsula up to Bulair and the Asiatic coast. The balloon rose at and the two observers watched the troops climb the cliffs and then reported the presence of the battleship &quot;Turgut Reis&quot; in the Narrows, which was chased away by . The airborne observers were hampered by the steep, scrub-covered hills and sandy gullies but maintained the patrols all day.

===V Beach===

====Covering force====

V Beach was long and wide, with a low bank about high on the landward side. Cape Helles and Fort Etrugrul (Fort No. 1) were on the left and the old Sedd el Bahr castle (Fort No. 3) was on the right looking from the sea; Hill 141 was further inland. The beach had been wired and was defended by about a company of men from the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Regiment, equipped with four Maxim guns. The first ashore was the 1st Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers which landed from ships&#x27; boats that were towed or rowed ashore. The rest were landed from a Trojan horse, , a converted collier, which had eleven machine-guns on the bow. Sally ports had been cut in the hull to allow the men to embark via gangways. The ship held the 1st Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers plus two companies of the 2nd Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment (from the 88th Brigade) and one company of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.

The tows containing the Dubliners were delayed by the current and came in thirty minutes late at The shore appeared lifeless following the bombardment but as the boats were about to land, the Ottoman defenders opened fire. Guns in the fort and castle enfiladed the beach and killed many of the men in the boats, some of which drifted away with no survivors. Many more casualties were suffered as the Dubliners waded ashore and some wounded men drowned. The survivors found shelter under the bank on the far side of the beach but most of the landing boats remained grounded with their crews dead around them. Two platoons landed intact on the right flank at the Camber and some troops reached the village, only to be overrun. Of the in the landing, killed and many of the rest were wounded. &quot;River Clyde&quot; grounded just before the tows and to connect the collier to the shore, the steam hopper &quot;Argyll&quot;, a flat-bottomed boat, was to beach ahead of it to provide a floating bridge, connecting the gangplanks in the bow of &quot;River Clyde&quot; to the beach. &quot;Argyll&quot; swung out to port and ended up broadside to the beach. The captain of &quot;River Clyde&quot;, Commander Edward Unwin, led men outside to manhandle three lighters (transport boats) on the starboard side, forward instead. Two companies of Munsters emerged from the sally ports, covered by the machine-guns on the bow and moved down the gangways to reach the shore but many were hit by bullets. Some troops managed to get ashore and others were drowned due to the weight of their equipment. Around another company made an attempt to disembark but after one company had got ashore, the casualties to the first two platoons were so great that the effort was suspended until dark.

====Main force====

Hunter-Weston had watched the landings on W Beach from offshore but received misleading reports at that the landings were succeeding. At Hunter-Weston instructed the main force to land and at second wave waited for the tows to return from the shore, although few arrived. Wounded were removed and several platoons under Brigadier-General Henry Napier sailed towards the beach. The calamity which had befallen the first wave was still unknown to Hunter-Weston, who at had ordered the troops on &quot;River Clyde&quot; to move towards the left flank and the troops on W Beach. At a company of the 2nd Hampshire tried to disembark but most were shot down on the gangways and the attempt was suspended. The vessel carrying Napier and his party was seen heading towards the beach and was called alongside &quot;River Clyde&quot;, from where Napier saw many men on the lighters in front of the collier and jumped onto the nearest, unaware that the men were dead. Napier and his staff reached the hopper, were pinned down and Napier was killed a few minutes later. At Hamilton, who had been watching the landing from , instructed Hunter-Weston to suspend the landing at V Beach and divert the rest of the V Beach force to W Beach.
During the afternoon &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, and bombarded the Ottoman defences on V Beach, which had little effect on the volume of fire directed at the British. During another attempt to land from &quot;River Clyde&quot;, when the bridge to the shore had been repaired at few troops managed to reach the ledge beyond the beach. At the battleships resumed the bombardment on the village, the crest of the ridge and the upper works of the fort; at about moved to the right flank and attacked the fort, where an Ottoman machine-gun crew repulsed the attack and forced the survivors back under cover. After dark the gangways of &quot;River Clyde&quot; were cleared of dead and wounded, which took until A surgeon on board the collier treated from despite being wounded in the foot. Around midnight, Hunter-Weston sent orders to attack Hill 141 but two liaison officers from Hamilton&#x27;s staff reported that a night attack was impossible; onshore the troops were organised into three parties to attack at after a bombardment by &quot;Albion&quot;.

The Ottoman defenders had an advantage in fighting from prepared positions, in the absence of surprise or accurate covering fire from the ships but experienced problems with communication and found that the artillery was out of range of the beach. Major Mahmut, the commander of the 3rd Battalion, 26th Regiment, could not find the position of the landing for some time in the confusion. Calls for reinforcements from the 25th Regiment were not met until on 26 April. A platoon commander Abdul Rahman, reported many casualties and at the Ottomans at the fort and on the flank under Sergeant Yaha were forced back. The battalion lost half of its men and the morale of many of the survivors collapsed next day when outflanked by the troops on S Beach. The Ottomans retired rapidly up the Kirte and Kandilere river beds, abandoning about seventy wounded men. Attempts to rally on the second line of defence failed and the survivors fell back to a line from Krithia in the late afternoon. By 27 April the beach defenders had lost 

===W Beach (&quot;Lancashire Landing&quot;)===

====Covering force====

W Beach lay on the coast to the north-west of Cape Helles, just south of Tekke Burnu, the site of a small gully. An infantry company from the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Regiment defended the beach, which was about long and from wide, with steep cliffs at the ends and a relatively easy approach over sand dunes in the centre, to a ridge with a view of the sea. The Ottomans had mined the beach and laid extensive barbed wire entanglements, including one along the shore and trip wires just under the surface of the water, a few yards offshore. Trenches on the high ground overlooked the beach and two machine-guns were hidden in the cliffs, to cover the wire in enfilade. The ridge beyond the centre of the beach was commanded by entrenchments on higher ground to the north-east and south-west and away lay one of two redoubts close to Hill 138, both extensively wired and behind slopes with no cover. Another barbed-wire entanglement ran from the southern redoubt to the cliffs near a lighthouse which blocked an advance from W Beach towards V Beach.

The 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers were embarked in the cruiser &quot;Euryalus&quot; and the battleship , which took up positions off the beach. The troops transferred to thirty-two cutters at about and &quot;Euryalus&quot; closed in on the beach at around An hour later, the six tows from &quot;Euryalus&quot; sailed towards the shore, in line abreast at intervals, the tows from &quot;Implacable&quot; to the left. As the tows reached to within of the shore they were cast off and the sailors in the cutters began to row. The shore had been silent but as the first boat landed, Ottoman small-arms fire swept the British and caused many casualties. &quot;Euryalus&quot; and lifted their bombardment ten minutes before the British landed and the Ottoman infantry had been able to emerge from cover. The survivors jumped from the cutters and tried to rush ashore but many leapt into deep water and sank under the weight of their equipment. The preliminary bombardment had not cut the wire along the shore and the surviving Fusiliers were fired on from three sides as they cut the wire or crawled underneath. A witness later wrote:

Small parties of Fusiliers got through the entanglement, reached the dunes behind the shore and captured the trenches beyond. Some of the tows from &quot;Implacable&quot; diverted towards the north side of the bay and landed unopposed. A small party climbed the cliff and occupied a trench on the top, drove off an Ottoman counter-attack and then engaged the Ottoman troops on the northern flank of the beach. Ottoman small-arms fire against the main landing began to diminish after a trench was hit by heavy shells from offshore; the Fusiliers cut more paths through the wire and attacked the cliff at the south end of the beach. Naval observers could see the trenches on the cliff top and as the British attacked the ships were

By the British had got far enough inland to deny the Ottomans observation over the area. On the northern flank, Brigadier-General Hare and the others who had outflanked the Ottoman defences to the north, advanced towards X Beach but after were engaged from Hill 114 and Hare was wounded. The second wave of tows had landed with few losses at around and prepared to attack Hill 138 with the survivors of the first wave. An inaccurate map caused delay as Hill 138 turned out to have another crest to the south-west crowned with another redoubt. During the landing, compasses, binoculars and watches had been soaked which added to the confusion. Two parties attacked the redoubts but were repulsed as troops on the left flank fought up the gully leading from the beach towards Hill 114, which was also attacked from X Beach. Ottoman prisoners taken near W Beach reported that there was only one division south of Krithia.

====Main force====
At Hunter-Weston ordered the main body to land and diverted some of the troops bound for V Beach to W Beach as reinforcements, which arrived at and at Hamilton ordered that the troops bound for V Beach be diverted to W Beach. Many casualties were incurred by the first reinforcements from long-range rifle fire as they approached the beach but were then obscured by the cliffs and were able to land and move between the flanks of the Lancashire Fusiliers. On the left flank the Fusiliers gained touch with troops from X Beach by and complete the capture of Hill 114. On the right, troops landed and tried to reach Hill 138 but were pinned down halfway to the crest. Another attack was made after another battalion had landed and the area had been bombarded by &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Euryalus&quot;.

The first redoubt was captured at and then after a difficult advance through barbed wire, took the second redoubt unopposed and with few casualties after the garrison retreated. The fall of the two redoubts enabled the troops pinned down near the lighthouse to advance towards V Beach until more wire was encountered. Troops tried to cut through but were visible on the sky line and shot down. Observers on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Albion&quot; offshore watched the attempts while unable to open fire due to ignorance of the situation ashore. After an hour the wire was cut but the troops were pinned down again on the far side.

It was not until that the disaster at V Beach was reported to Colonel Wolley-Dod on W Beach, who ordered the troops at the two redoubts to capture the cliff above V Beach. The troops were already advancing to Fort No 1. but the Ottoman defenders at V Beach swiftly stopped the advance and the troops dug in, which ended the attempt to retrieve the situation at V Beach. On the northern flank, Hill 114 was consolidated but an advance to the second objective from W Beach was not made and despite outnumbering the Ottoman troops British awaited fresh orders, which were not forthcoming, due to the loss of the commander of the landing force and the difficulties in communication with the headquarters staffs still afloat. The plan for a combined advance to the second objective broke down and there was no-one ashore to devise an alternative. With a definite objective the troops and officers of the 29th Division overcame many novel obstacles but then the twelve battalions between Hill 114 and Hill 138 did not press on against an exiguous defence.

===S Beach===
S Beach lay inside the Straits at a small break in the cliffs at the north end of Morto Bay, from V Beach. On top of the cliff lay de Tott&#x27;s Battery, a derelict fortification. No defences had been prepared in the area and only one Ottoman platoon guarded the beach, with another platoon inland. Four trawlers, each with six lifeboats in tow, made slow progress against the Dardanelles current and mine sweepers in the Straits but Ottoman artillery on the Asiatic shore fired at other targets and the trawlers came inshore without incident and when the trawlers reached the shallows the tows were cast off. The landing party of three companies of the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers covered by the battleship &quot;Cornwallis&quot; made landfall under fire from the Ottoman platoon in a trench half-way up the cliff. Two companies landed on the beach and one escaladed the cliffs at Eski Hissarlik point to capture de Tott&#x27;s Battery.

Captain Davidson of &quot;Cornwallis&quot; made an unauthorised landing with a party of sailors and marines to supplement the landing force, casualties for all of the landing parties being sailors and marines. At the battery the British overlooked the Ottoman platoon and took fifteen prisoners; by the landings were complete. From the cliffs, the disaster at V Beach could be seen but the instructions given to the commander were to wait for the advance from the south. After a prisoner claimed that there were another troops nearby, the commander continued to consolidate the position, rather than attack the rear of the Ottoman position at Sedd el Bahr. It was later found that the only Ottoman troops near the landing was a company less the platoon killed and captured during the landing and another company sent from Krithia but diverted to Sedd el Bahr before the landing commenced. The landing by the captain of &quot;Cornwallis&quot; led to a delay in the arrival of the ship at V Beach, where it was scheduled to regulate the landing.

===X Beach (&quot;Implacable Beach&quot;)===

====Covering force====

X Beach was long under a low crumbling cliff on the Aegean shore around from W Beach, about above Tekke Burnu. No Ottoman defences had been built and only twelve soldiers guarded the beach. The Ottoman party was stunned by the bombardment from &quot;Implacable&quot; after the troops bound for W Beach had disembarked and the four tows had sailed parallel to the battleship until it was from the shore. The landing party had reached the shore and climbed to the top of the cliff with no casualties by when the tows returned to collect the rest of the battalion and equipment, which had arrived by As the British pushed inland, they came close to a locality where two Ottoman reserve companies were bivouacked. One company had been sent towards W Beach and met the British advance from X Beach. The British commander Lieutenant-Colonel H. E. B. Newenham, ordered an attack to the north-east to form a defensive flank on the left, two platoons to advance frontally and dig in from the beach and the rest of the landing force to attack Hill 114 on the right, to gain touch with the troops on W Beach.

The attack to the north-east began around until stopped by Ottoman small-arms fire after but on the right flank, the attack reached the top of Hill 114 by to the cheers of the watching sailors on &quot;Implacable&quot;. The front along the beach was long and had numerous gaps, with the left flank engaged with the Ottoman defenders. With no reconnaissance possible before the landing and only one inaccurate map to read, the value of the view from the cliffs above the beach had not been appreciated beforehand. The landward slopes of hills 138 and 141 were easily visible and within reach of an advance from X Beach, which might have cut off the defenders of W Beach. S Beach at Morto Bay away was also visible but the landing force on X Beach concentrated on the landing. Few of the officers in the X Beach party knew of the landing at S Beach and no messages were passed between them during the day.

====Main force====
The main force began to land at with little interruption by the Ottomans, apart from the sound of firing on the left flank. Two of the main force battalions had been withdrawn from the landing, to reinforce the landings at Y and S beaches and the 1st Border and 1st Inniskilling battalions were the divisional reserve, to be held back for emergencies. The initial landing party was not under the command of Brigadier-General W. R. Marshall and the main force had no instructions, to participate in its second phase advance to a line from Y Beach to Sedd el Bahr. No news had arrived of the other landings and the easy arrival at X Beach, led to him expecting soon to be joined by the troops from W and V beaches. Marshall climbed the cliff and during a briefing, received a message requesting assistance from the left flank so sent the reserve company. Marshall ordered the Borderers to the top of the cliff and then sent a company to assist the troops on Hill 114. Soon afterwards, British troops were seen retreating on the left, pursued by Ottoman infantry and Marshall began to order a counter-charge when he was wounded and Major C. D. Vaughan killed.

The Ottoman infantry were a few hundred yards from the shore when they were repulsed by a bayonet charge. The British were content to restore the position and did not pursue the Ottomans. Some news had arrived by but nothing from W Beach or divisional headquarters. It could be seen that the troops on W and V beaches had been delayed because Ottoman soldiers were still holding hills 141 and 138, although in unknown strength. Marshall was certain of his instructions regarding the reserve battalions and ordered them to dig in on a perimeter. Though greatly outnumbered, the Ottomans paralysed the initiative of the invaders and gained time to organise defences and bring up reinforcements. At Marshall contacted Hunter-Weston offering to advance to Y Beach but was ordered to wait until morning and complete the original plan. An order then arrived from W Beach from Wolley-Dod to advance the right flank towards X Beach and gain touch but this was not possible as the Ottomans counter-attacked Y Beach.

===Y Beach===
Y Beach was a considerable distance north along the Aegean coast, close to Krithia and behind most of the Ottoman defences at Cape Helles. The sea at the shore was deep enough for boats to sail within a few yards and the coast was a steep cliff about high, with two gullies giving easy access to the top. The area was undefended and the nearest Ottoman troops were two platoons south near Gully Ravine, a platoon of the 2nd Battalion, 26th Regiment at Sari Tepe and the 25th Regiment at Serafim Farm, away. The 1st Battalion, 26th Regiment was stationed between Semerly Tepe and Sari Tepe, north of Y Beach but was held back to guard against another landing for two days. The cruisers and with a transport N2 and eight trawlers rendezvoused west of Y Beach with the covering force, the battleship and the cruiser . At the troops transferred to the trawlers which steamed inshore, with &quot;Goliath&quot; out and the cruisers closer to the shore. At trawlers steamed forward until they touched bottom and then embarked their troops in the boats, which were rowed to the beach as the bombardment on Cape Helles began.

The Plymouth Battalion RND (Lieutenant-Colonel Godfrey Matthews), the 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers (Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Koe) and a company of the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers landed at Y Beach from Scouts moving forward in the centre and on the flanks found four Ottoman soldiers, two of whom were killed and two captured. Two companies advanced to Gully Ravine, about beyond the cliff top and at two companies of marines moved forward south-eastwards across the ravine, to search for a suspected Ottoman artillery piece. News of the success of the landing was passed to Hamilton as &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; steamed past at The landing force waited until mid-afternoon for the expected advance from Cape Helles, in conditions so quiet, that Matthews and an adjutant crossed Gully Ravine and walked to within of Krithia and found no sign of Ottoman troops.

The marine search party moved for about south-east but found no sign of a gun and retired at unchallenged. A message was sent to X Beach asking for an update, but no reply was received. At at noon, firing was heard from X Beach but no instructions arrived from 29th Division Headquarters, so Matthews ordered the position to be consolidated. At with no sign of an advance from the cape Matthews withdrew from the ravine and began to dig in again on the cliff top. Dead ground around the landing site forced the British to establish a lengthy perimeter, along which the 29th Division troops were placed in the centre and marines on the flanks. From the ships the retirement could not be seen and digging in on the new positions was slowed, because entangled roots lay under the surface and the heavy digging implements were still on the beach, which resulted in the entrenchments being little more than deep by late afternoon.

At Serafim Farm, Sami Bey the Ottoman 9th Division commander, received news of the landing as soon as it began and at sent an infantry battalion, an artillery battery and a section of machine-guns to the landing site. Just after one of the guns opened fire and at Ottoman infantry began to counter-attack the beachhead. The first attack was made by a company and was dispersed by naval gunfire. When the guns ceased fire after dark, the Ottoman infantry attacked with great determination. By reinforcements had increased the number of Ottoman troops to battalions and British losses led Matthews to signal for reinforcements, for which he received no reply. At dawn on 26 April, the Ottoman infantry withdrew, having suffered casualties and inflicted British losses of Koe had been mortally wounded and his adjutant killed; ammunition had run short in the beachhead and was complicated by the need to supply Mark VI as well as Mark VII rifle ammunition. As soon as dawn broke, the bombardment ships resumed firing.

During the night, some British troops began to straggle back to the beach and their morale was depressed further, when a ship salvo fell short into the beachhead. At the ships received a request for help from a party ashore, which had run out of ammunition and was the first indication that things were amiss. Boats sent to the beach to re-embark the party and its wounded were seen by other troops on the beach, the impression was formed that a general re-embarkation had begun and some stragglers climbed aboard the boats. Unknown to Matthews and the troops on the heights who had spent the night repulsing Ottoman infantry attacks, the evacuation had already begun. A few minutes later Matthews signalled that the ships should fire beyond the cliff edge, onto Ottoman troops who were massing for another attack, which began at and broke through the centre of the British line.

With no reserves, the British rallied and routed the attackers by a bayonet charge, which ended the threat to the beachhead. The initial Ottoman breakthrough had caused a panic behind the British defenders, which was reflected in signals received by the ships. After the attack had been repulsed, Matthews toured the positions on the right flank and found that they were empty. When he realised that the troops nearer the beach had been re-embarking, he saw no option but to allow it to continue and collected a party of men to defend the gully, until the wounded had been evacuated. By all of the troops on the beach had left and the rearguard withdrew from the cliff and was rowed away within thirty minutes. During the departure, no gunfire was received from the Ottoman troops in the vicinity and when a naval officer led a party of marines ashore in the afternoon to look for survivors, they were able to search the area for an hour without interference.

===Diversions===

====Bulair====
Eleven troopships, , and , two destroyers and several trawlers made rendezvous off Bulair before dawn. The warships began a day-long bombardment just after first light and a destroyer made a close pass off the beach. Later on, ships&#x27; boats were swung out from the troopships and lines of eight cutters pulled by trawlers, made as if to land. In the late afternoon men began to embark on the boats, which headed for the shore just before dark and returned after nightfall. During the night, Lieutenant-Commander B. C. Freyberg swam ashore and lit flares along the beach, crept inland and observed the Ottoman defences, which he found to be dummies, returning safely. Just after dawn, the decoy force sailed south to join the main landings.

====Kumkale====

At French battleships and , with the cruisers and , the British battleship and the Russian cruiser began a bombardment of Kumkale before the landed near the fort, on a small undefended beach but the current flowing from the Dardanelles was so fast, that the landing force reached the beach only at The lack of surprise was compensated for by the long bombardment, on terrain much flatter than that of the peninsula and most of the Ottoman troops were so shaken by the time of the landing, that they had retired across the river. The fort and village of Kum Kale were swiftly occupied with few casualties. The rest of the disembarkation was also delayed by the current but at an advance began towards Yeni Shehr and the Orkanie Mound, where the advances were stopped by the Ottoman defenders. An observation aircraft reported that reinforcements had arrived and the attempt was abandoned. During the night the French illuminated the area with searchlights and &quot;Jauréguiberry&quot; maintained a slow bombardment. At Ottoman counter-attacks began and continued until dawn, all of them costly failures; the French prepared to resume the advance to Yeni Shehr in the morning.

On 26 April, Ottoman troops captured the Kum Kale cemetery and then advanced with white flags and dropped their weapons. Ottoman and French troops mingled, officers began to parlay and suddenly Capitaine Roeckel was abducted. French troops resumed hostilities but the French and Ottoman infantry were still mixed up and some Ottomans slipped past, occupied several houses and captured two machine-guns. The French re-captured the houses but an attempt to get the guns back was another costly failure. The French concluded that the surrender had been genuine but had then been infiltrated by other troops conducting a ruse. The French shot nine prisoners in reprisal. During the day the Ottoman commander requested reinforcements. By the end of the diversion, French casualties were and the Ottoman defenders had including By 27 April, the French had landed on the right flank of the British at Helles. After the landings, the Ottoman commander, General Weber Pasha, was criticised for being caught unprepared, poor tactics, communication failures and leadership, although the flat terrain had made accurate bombardment from offshore much easier. An Ottoman artillery battery at Tepe caused severe casualties during the departure, and &quot;Savoie&quot; sailed inshore to bombard the Ottomans.

====Beşik Bay====
On the night of six French troop transports, with two destroyers and a torpedo boat, appeared off Besika Bay (now Beşik Bay). The warships commenced a bombardment and boats were lowered from the transports, to simulate a disembarkation. At the cruiser &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; arrived and joined in the bombardment, before the force was recalled to Tenedos at The Ottoman garrison was detained in the area until 27 April, although the Turkish Official Account recorded that the landings at Kum Kale and the demonstration at Besika Bay had been recognised as ruses. Transfers of troops from the Asiatic shore was delayed by lack of boats and the fear of Allied submarines, rather than apprehension about landings on the Asiatic side. It was not until 29 April, that troops from the area appeared on the Helles front.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
In 2001, Travers wrote that the fire power of the modern Ottoman weapons and resilience of field fortifications, caused many Allied losses, particularly at V and W beaches. There was much criticism of Hamilton, for not ordering Hunter-Weston to send more troops to Y Beach but this was not due to Hamilton leaving discretion to his subordinate, since Hunter-Weston was ordered to divert part of the main force from V to W Beach at noon. Conditions at V Beach were not known to Hamilton, until he had been in contact with Hunter-Weston and interfering with the landing plan, could have added to the delays in landing troops. Hunter-Weston concentrated on the landings at V and W beaches and later on Hill 138, which was consistent with the tendency of generals on the Western Front to dwell on areas where enemy resistance was strongest and to reinforce failure. Travers wrote that the French landing at Kum Kale had been overlooked yet had been one of the most successful, despite initial Ottoman confidence that the landing would be defeated by the four battalions concentrated nearby. The Ottoman XV Corps commander General Weber Pasha was criticised for being unprepared, poor communications, tactics and leadership, when fighting in flatter terrain than that on the peninsula, on which the French artillery was able to dominate the Ottoman infantry. Despite this advantage, the French advance was stopped by the Ottomans on 26 April, in a costly defensive action.

The landings at S, X, Y and Kum Kale were the most successful, through surprise, close naval support and the inability of the Ottomans to garrison all of the coast, only the most obviously vulnerable points. The main landings at V and W beaches were the most costly. Naval ships which moved close inshore to bombard the Ottoman positions had some effect and at W Beach were able to suppress Ottoman return fire, after the early British losses. At V Beach the bombardments had less effect and the ploy of landing from &quot;River Clyde&quot; failed, leaving the survivors stranded until 26 April. The landing at Y Beach was a success because it was unopposed, yet the difficulty of bombarding the high ground was the cause of much of the British difficulty. Travers also listed inexperience and technical inadequacy, which left the senior commanders stuck aboard ship and the commanders who went ashore, becoming casualties. While greatly outnumbered, the Ottomans made good use of their field fortifications, machine-guns and rifles to defend the beaches and obstruct any advance inland.

In 1929, C. F. Aspinall-Oglander, the British Official Historian wrote that in the course of the Gallipoli campaign, the MEF failed to reach its first day objectives but that the plan to advance to Achi Baba had a reasonable chance of success. He wrote that the main reason for the failure, lay in the unusual number of senior officers who became casualties. From the beginning of the landings, the 29th Division lost two of three brigadiers, two of three brigade majors and most of the senior officers in the battalions of the covering force, which landed at X, W and V beaches. Oglander also wrote that making landings on small beaches with few boats, required elaborate and rigid instructions, if the passage from ship to shore was to be efficient and the plans laid by the army and navy staffs and the headquarters of the 29th Division had been excellent but left very little discretion, should the landings not meet equal success. The commanders on Y and S beaches had been ordered to wait for the advance from the main beaches and join in the attack on Achi Baba. No provision was made for an attack &quot;towards&quot; the main beaches to give assistance, yet the number of troops landed on the minor beaches exceeded the size of the Ottoman garrison at the south end of the peninsula.

The failure to contemplate the possibility, that the troops at Y and S beaches might need to support the main landings, also exposed the failure to retain a reserve under the control of the Commander-in-Chief. Oglander speculated that had there been two battalions available, to land at the weakest point that the main landings had revealed in the Ottoman defences, Helles and Sedd el Bahr would have fallen by midday. Such a manoeuvre would have needed good communication between land and sea but the difficulty was underestimated and hampered British operations all day. The obvious difficulties of moving troops in open boats by instalments had been distracting, particularly the moments between disembarkation and reaching the shore, despite the confidence of the navy in its plans for bombardment. The apprehension was justified and the landing at V Beach was only saved from catastrophe by the covering fire of the machine-guns on &quot;River Clyde&quot;; defeat at W Beach was only averted by turning the Ottoman right flank. Lack of experience of opposed landings under modern conditions, made it difficult to rally scattered units and the challenge of organising an advance inland was underestimated. It had been a mistake not to stress to all members of the landing force, that there would be little time to move inland before Ottoman reinforcements arrived.

The landing plan had been based on the importance of maintaining liaison between the army and navy, which had led to a decision that the 29th Division headquarters should stay aboard &quot;Euryalus&quot; and that Hamilton and the MEF headquarters should remain on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, the flagship of the naval commander-in-chief. Despite the efforts of the navy, Hunter-Weston and the 29th Division headquarters were out of contact with the landing forces for most of the day, despite being barely from the front line. When &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was needed to bombard V Beach, Hamilton was isolated there, from the afternoon to the evening of 25 April, incapable of intervening anywhere else. Oglander suggested that a separate communications vessel should have been prepared for the army and navy staffs, equipped with signalling apparatus to maintain touch with the landing forces, free from other demands for its services.

The stress and exhaustion of the landings and the unknown nature of the environment ashore combined with officer casualties left some of the units of the 29th Division to be in great difficulty by the afternoon, unaware that the Ottoman defenders were in an equally demoralised state. Before the invasion Hunter-Weston had printed a &quot;Personal Note&quot; to each soldier in the division to explain the hazards of the landing as a forewarning, writing of

to which the troops would be exposed. In the southern landings, the British landed battalions by against a maximum of two Ottoman battalions and Oglander wrote that the failure at V Beach caused the failure of the British plan to reach Achi Baba. The Ottoman defenders were too few to defeat the invasion but the leadership of Sami Bey, who sent the few reinforcements available to the 26th Regiment, gave orders to drive the British into the sea, a simple instruction which all could understand. The company at Sedd el Bahr endured the naval guns and held on to the position all day, being reinforced by about two companies. Overnight, the small parties of Ottoman infantry at W and X beaches contained the British and by on 26 April had compelled the abandonment of Y Beach.

===Casualties===

Oglander wrote that the Turkish Official Account recorded casualties, from the five battalions south of Achi Baba before morning on 27 April, in the first two days of the landings at Cape Helles. John Keegan in 1998, wrote that British casualties at Cape Helles during the morning were The 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers and 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers re-formed a composite battalion, known as the Dubsters and the original battalions were reformed after the evacuation. The Munsters moved to the 48th Brigade in the 16th (Irish) Division in May 1916 and were joined by the Dubliners in October 1917. Of the eleven survived the Gallipoli campaign unscathed.

===Subsequent operations===
The Allied attack began at on 28 April with a naval bombardment. The plan of advance was for the French to hold position on the right, while the British line would pivot and capture Krithia and Achi Baba from the south and west. The plan was poorly communicated to the brigade and battalion commanders of the 29th Division. Hunter-Weston remained in the rear and was not able to exert any control as the attack developed. The initial advance was swift but pockets of Ottoman resistance were encountered, in some places the advance was stopped and at others kept moving, leaving both sides outflanked, which was more of a disadvantage to the attackers. As the British and French advanced, the terrain became more difficult, as the troops reached four great ravines, which ran from the heights around Achi Baba towards the cape.

On the left flank, two battalions of the 87th Brigade (1st Border Regiment and 1st Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers) entered Gully Ravine but were halted by a machine-gun post near Y Beach. No further advance could be made up the ravine until the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles captured the post on the night of which involved them climbing a vertical slope, which had defeated the Royal Marine Light Infantry and the Royal Dublin Fusiliers; the site became known as &quot;Gurkha Bluff&quot;. Exhausted, demoralised and virtually leaderless British troops could go no further, in the face of increasing Ottoman resistance and in places, Ottoman counter-attacks drove the French and British back to their starting positions. By the attack had been called off. Of troops involved, and casualties were suffered.

==Victoria Cross==

Six Victoria Crosses were awarded to troops who took part in the landing on W Beach, three in August 1915 and three more in 1917. Because of this, the event was later described in the Allied press as &quot;six VCs before Breakfast&quot;. The recipients were
* Captain Cuthbert Bromley
* Corporal John Grimshaw
* Private William Kenealy
* Sergeant Alfred Richards
* Sergeant Frank Stubbs
* Captain Richard Willis

The six men were originally nominated by Major Bishop, the battalion commanding officer, after consulting &quot;the officers who happened to be with him at the time and who did not include either of the officers awarded the Cross&quot;. Initially, the recommendation was endorsed by Hunter-Weston and Hamilton but was not carried forward by the War Office. In August, three medals were awarded after a second recommendation by Hunter-Weston; under the original 1856 warrant establishing the award, up to four VCs could be awarded as a result of balloting the units involved. Hunter-Weston stated that a vote had been held and Willis was selected by the officers, Richards by the NCOs and Kenealy by the private soldiers. The awards were published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 24 August 1915.

Brigadier Owen Wolley-Dod, a member of Hunter-Weston&#x27;s general staff and a Lancashire Fusilier, who had landed on the beach shortly after noon, pressed for more awards to be made; the other three men were recognised in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 13 March 1917, with an identical citation to the original three men. Bromley had died when his troopship had been sunk and Grimshaw had been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for his actions during the landing. The DCM was cancelled and replaced by a Victoria Cross. Stubbs had been killed in the assault on Hill 114 on the day of the landing.

===V Beach===
Six Victoria Crosses were awarded at V Beach to sailors or men from the Royal Naval Division who had attempted to maintain the bridge of lighters and recover the wounded, including Commander Unwin, Sub-Lieutenant Arthur Tisdall, Able Seaman William Williams, Seaman George Samson and Midshipmen George Drewry and Wilfred Malleson. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Doughty-Wylie was awarded a posthumous VC, for leading the attack finally to capture Sedd el Bahr on the morning 26 April, during which William Cosgrove of the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was also awarded a VC.

<doc id="651860" wikidata="Q189271" url="?curid=651860" title="Mahmud of Ghazni">
<text>Abu al-Qasim Mahmud ibn Sabuktigin (; 2 November 971 – 30 April 1030), usually known as Mahmud of Ghazni or Mahmud Ghaznavi (), was Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire, ruling from 998 to 1030. During his reign and in medieval sources, he is usually known by his honorific title Yamin al-Dawla (, ). At the time of his death, his kingdom had been transformed into an extensive military empire, which extended from northwestern Iran proper to the Punjab in the Indian subcontinent, Khwarazm in Transoxiana, and Makran.

Highly Persianized, Mahmud continued the bureaucratic, political, and cultural customs of his predecessors, the Samanids. He established the ground for a future Persianate state in Punjab, particularly centered on Lahore, a city he conquered. His capital of Ghazni evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual centre in the Islamic world, almost rivalling the important city of Baghdad. The capital appealed to many prominent figures, such as al-Biruni and Ferdowsi.
Mahmud ascended the throne at the age of 27 upon his father&#x27;s death, albeit after a brief war of succession with his brother Ismail. He was the first ruler to hold the title &quot;Sultan&quot; (&quot;authority&quot;), signifying the extent of his power while at the same time preserving an ideological link to the suzerainty of the Abbasid Caliphs. During his rule, he invaded and plundered the richest cities and temple towns, such as Mathura and Somnath in medieval India seventeen times, and used the booty to build his capital in Ghazni.

== Birth and background ==
Mahmud was born in the town of Ghazni in the region of Zabulistan (in present-day Afghanistan) on 2 November 971. His father, Sabuktigin, was a Turkic slave commander who laid foundations to the Ghaznavid dynasty in Ghazni in 977, which he ruled as a subordinate of the Samanids, who ruled Khorasan and Transoxiana. Mahmud&#x27;s mother was a local woman of possible Iranian descent from a landowning aristocrat family in the region of Zabulistan, and he is therefore known in some sources as &quot;Mahmud-i Zavuli&quot; (&quot;Mahmud from Zabulistan&quot;). Not much about Mahmud&#x27;s early life is known, other than that he was a school-mate and foster brother of Ahmad Maymandi, a Persian native of Zabulistan.

==Family==
Mahmud married the daughter of Abu&#x27;l Haret Ahmad, and they had twin sons, Mohammad and Ma&#x27;sud, who succeeded him one after the other; his grandson by Mas&#x27;ud, Maw&#x27;dud Ghaznavi, also later became ruler of the empire. According to &quot;Mirat-i-Masudi&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Masud&quot;), a Persian-language hagiography written by Abdur Rahman Chishti in the 1620s, Mahmud&#x27;s sister, Sitr-e-Mu&#x27;alla, was purportedly married to Dawood bin Ataullah Alavi, also known as Gazi Saiyyed Salar Sahu, whose son was Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud.

Mahmud&#x27;s companion was a Georgian slave, Malik Ayaz, about whom poems and stories have been told.

== Early career==

In 994 Mahmud joined his father Sabuktigin in the capture of Khorasan from the rebel Fa&#x27;iq in aid of the Samanid Emir, Nuh II. During this period, the Samanid Empire became highly unstable, with shifting internal political tides as various factions vied for control, the chief among them being Abu&#x27;l-Qasim Simjuri, Fa&#x27;iq, AbuAli, the General Bekhtuzin as well as the neighbouring Buyids and Kara-Khanid Khanate.

==Reign==
Sabuktigin died in 997, and was succeeded by his son Ismail as the ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty. The reason behind Sabuktigin&#x27;s choice to appoint Ismail as heir over the more experienced and older Mahmud is uncertain. It may have been due to Ismail&#x27;s mother being the daughter of Sabuktigin&#x27;s old master, Alptigin. Mahmud shortly revolted, and with the help of his other brother, Abu&#x27;l-Muzaffar, the governor of Bust, he defeated Ismail the following year at the battle of Ghazni and gained control over the Ghaznavid kingdom. That year, in 998, Mahmud then traveled to Balkh and paid homage to Amir Abu&#x27;l-Harith Mansur b. Nur II. He then appointed Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Isfaraini as his vizier, and then set out west from Ghazni to take the Kandahar region followed by Bost (Lashkar Gah), which he transformed to a militarised city.
Mahmud initiated the first of numerous invasions of North India. On 28November 1001, his army fought and defeated the army of Raja Jayapala of the Kabul Shahis at the Battle of Peshawar. In 1002 Mahmud invaded Sistan and dethroned Khalaf ibn Ahmad, ending the Saffarid dynasty. From there he decided to focus on Hindustan to the southeast, particularly the highly fertile lands of the Punjab region.

Mahmud&#x27;s first campaign to the south was against an Ismaili state first established at Multan in 965 by a da&#x27;i from the Fatimid Caliphate in a bid to curry political favor and recognition with the Abbasid Caliphate; he also engaged elsewhere with the Fatimids. At this point, Jayapala attempted to exact revenge for an earlier military defeat at the hands of Mahmud&#x27;s father, who had controlled Ghazni in the late 980s and had cost Jayapala extensive territory. His son Anandapala succeeded him and continued the struggle to avenge his father&#x27;s suicide. In the Battle of Chach, he assembled a powerful confederacy that suffered defeat as his elephant turned back from the battle at a crucial moment, turning the tide in Mahmud&#x27;s favor once more at Lahore in 1008 and bringing Mahmud control of the Shahi dominions of Udbandpura.

===Ghaznavid campaigns in the Indian subcontinent===

Following the defeat of the Indian Confederacy, after deciding to retaliate for their combined resistance, Mahmud then set out on regular expeditions against them, leaving the conquered kingdoms in the hands of Hindu vassals and annexing only the Punjab region. He also vowed to raid and loot the wealthy region of northwestern India every year.

In 1001 Mahmud of Ghazni first invaded modern day Pakistan and then parts of India. Mahmud defeated, captured, and later released the Hindu Shahi ruler Jayapala, who had moved his capital to Peshawar (modern Pakistan). Jayapala killed himself and was succeeded by his son Anandapala. In 1005 Mahmud of Ghazni invaded Bhatia (probably Bhera), and in 1006 he invaded Multan, at which time Anandapala&#x27;s army attacked him. The following year Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and crushed Sukhapala, ruler of Bathinda (who had become ruler by rebelling against the Shahi kingdom). In 1008–1009, Mahmud defeated the Hindu Shahis in the Battle of Chach. In 1013, during Mahmud&#x27;s eighth expedition into eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Shahi kingdom (which was then under Trilochanapala, son of Anandapala) was overthrown.

In 1014 Mahmud led an expedition to Thanesar. The next year he unsuccessfully attacked Kashmir. The ruler of Kashmir Sangramaraja had been an ally of the Hindu Shahis against the Ghaznavids, and Mahmud wanted retribution. Antagonized by Sangramaraja&#x27;s having helped Trilochanapala, Mahmud invaded Kashmir. He advanced along the Tohi river valley, planning to enter Kashmir through the Tosamaidan pass. However, his advanced was checked by the strong fort of Loharkot. After having besieged the fort for a month, Mahmud abandoned the siege and retreated, losing many of his troops on his way and almost losing his own life as well. In 1021, Mahmud again attempted to invade Kashmir, but was again not able to advance beyond the Loharkot fort. After the two failed invasion attempts, he did not attempt to invade Kashmir again.

In 1018 Mahmud attacked Mathura and defeated a coalition of rulers there while also killing a ruler called Chandrapala. The city of Mathura was &quot;ruthlessly sacked, ravaged, desecrated and destroyed&quot;. In particular, Al-utbi mentioned in his work &quot;Tarikh-e-yamini&quot;, that Mahmud Ghaznavi destroyed a &quot;great and magnificent temple&quot; in Mathura. According to Firishta, writing a &quot;History of Hindustan&quot; in the 16th-17th century, the city of Mathura was the richest in India, and was consecrated to Vāsudeva-Krishna. When it was attacked by Mahmud of Ghazni, &quot;all the idols&quot; were burnt and destroyed during a period of twenty days, gold and silver was smelted for booty, and the city was burnt down. The Art of Mathura fell into decline thereafter.

In 1021 Mahmud supported the Kannauj king against Chandela Ganda, who was defeated. That same year Shahi Trilochanapala was killed at Rahib and his son Bhimapala succeeded him. Lahore (modern Pakistan) was annexed by Mahmud. Mahmud besieged Gwalior, in 1023, where he was given tribute. Mahmud attacked Somnath in 1025, and its ruler Bhima I fled. The next year, he captured Somnath and marched to Kachch against Bhima I. That same year Mahmud also attacked the Jats of Jud and defeated them. Mahmud&#x27;s desecration of the Somnath temple in Gujarat in 1024 CE motivated Rajput king Bhoja to lead an army against him, however after Somnath raid, Mahmud Gazhnavi chose a more dangerous route via Sindh, to avoid facing the invading powerful armies of Bhoja, he passed through a desert, where the scarcity of food and water killed a large number of his soldiers and animals, Kitabh Zainu&#x27;l Akhbar () by &#x27;Abd al-Hayy Gardizi,
Tabaqat-i-Akbari by Nizamuddin Ahmad and Firishta&#x27;s writings also mention this incident.

Christoph Baumer notes that in 1026 CE, Jats &quot;inflicted heavy losses&quot; on the army of Mahmud while it was on its way from Somnath to Multan. Later in 1027 CE, he avenged the attack by the Jats, who had been resisting &quot;forced Islamisation&quot; for the past 300 years, by ravaging their fleet in the Indus river. Even though the Jats had a bigger fleet than Mahmud, he is said to have had around 20 archers on each of his 1400 boats, stocked with &quot;special projectiles&quot; carrying naphtha, which he used to burn the Jats&#x27; fleet.

The Indian kingdoms of Nagarkot, Thanesar, Kannauj, and Gwalior were all conquered and left in the hands of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist kings as vassal states and he was pragmatic enough not to neglect making alliances and enlisting local peoples into his armies at all ranks. Since Mahmud never kept a permanent presence in the northwestern subcontinent, he engaged in a policy of destroying Hindu temples and monuments to crush any move by the Hindus to attack the Empire; Nagarkot, Thanesar, Mathura, Kannauj, Kalinjar (1023) and Somnath all submitted or were raided. It is estimated Mahmud&#x27;s invasions killed over 2 million people.

==Events and challenges==

In 1025 Mahmud raided Gujarat, plundering the Somnath temple and breaking its &quot;jyotirlinga&quot;. He took away booty of 2 million dinars. The conquest of Somnath was followed by a punitive invasion of Anhilwara. Some historians claim that there are records of pilgrimages to the temple in 1038 that do not mention damage to the temple. However, powerful legends with intricate detail had developed regarding Mahmud&#x27;s raid in the Turko-Persian literature, which &quot;electrified&quot; the Muslim world according to scholar Meenakshi Jain.

===Historiography concerning Somnath===

Historians including Thapar, Eaton, and A. K. Majumdar have questioned the iconoclastic historiography of this incident. Thapar quoted Majumdar (1956): 
Thapar also argued against the prevalent narrative: 

===Political challenges===

The last four years of Mahmud&#x27;s life were spent contending with the influx of Oghuz and Seljuk Turks from Central Asia and the Buyid dynasty. Initially, after being repulsed by Mahmud, the Seljuks retired to Khwarezm, but Togrül and Çagrı led them to capture Merv and Nishapur (1028–1029). Later, they repeatedly raided and traded territory with his successors across Khorasan and Balkh and even sacked Ghazni in 1037. In 1040, at the Battle of Dandanaqan, they decisively defeated Mahmud&#x27;s son, Mas&#x27;udI, resulting in Mas&#x27;ud abandoning most of his western territories to the Seljuks.

===Death===
On 30 April 1030 Sultan Mahmud died in Ghazni at the age of 58. Sultan Mahmud had contracted malaria during his last invasion. The medical complication from malaria had caused lethal tuberculosis. His mausoleum is located in Ghazni, Afghanistan.

==View on religion and war==

Under the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni, the region broke away from the Samanid sphere of influence. While he acknowledged the Abbasids as caliph as a matter of form, he was also granted the title Sultan in recognition of his independence.

Following Mahmud&#x27;s recognition by the Abbasid caliphate in 999, he pledged a &quot;jihad&quot; and a raid on India every year. In 1005 Mahmud conducted a series of campaigns during which the Ismailis of Multan were massacred.

Following his quest for Jihad in India, Mahmud Ghazni not only ruined the Somnath temple and plundered its treasures but also killed every devotee present in the town. He did the same with women devotees, either killing them or kidnapped them to be later sold in the slave markets of Afghanistan.

Mahmud used his plundered wealth to finance his armies which included mercenaries. The Indian soldiers, whom Romila Thapar presumed to be Hindus, were one of the components of the army with their commander called &quot;sipahsalar-i-Hinduwan&quot; and lived in their own quarter of Ghazna practicing their own religion. Indian soldiers under their commander Suvendhray remained loyal to Mahmud. They were also used against a Turkic rebel, with the command given to a Hindu named Tilak according to Baihaki.

Indian historian Mohammad Habib states that there was no imposition of Jizya on &quot;non-Muslims&quot; during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni nor any mention of &quot;forced conversions&quot;: 

A. V. Williams Jackson, Professor of Indo-Iranian Languages in Columbia University has written in his book &quot;History of India&quot;, &quot;Mahmud vowed that every year he would wage a Holy War against the infidels of Hindustan&quot;. During the seventh year of his reign, Mahmud mintage from Lahore styled him as &quot;Mahmud &quot;but-shikan&quot;&quot; (Mahmud the breaker of idols).

==Legacy==
By the end of his reign, the Ghaznavid Empire extended from Ray in the west to Samarkand in the north-east, and from the Caspian Sea to the Yamuna. Although his raids carried his forces across the Indian subcontinent, only a portion of the Punjab and of Sindh in modern-day Pakistan came under his semi-permanent rule; Kashmir, the Doab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat remained under the control of the local Hindu dynasties.

The booty brought back to Ghazni was enormous, and contemporary historians (e.g. Abolfazl Beyhaghi, Ferdowsi) give descriptions of the magnificence of the capital, as well as of the conqueror&#x27;s munificent support of literature. He transformed Ghazni, the first centre of Persian literature, into one of the leading cities of Central Asia, patronizing scholars, establishing colleges, laying out gardens, and building mosques, palaces, and caravansaries. Mahmud brought whole libraries from Ray and Isfahan to Ghazni. He even demanded that the Khwarizmshah court send its men of learning to Ghazni.

Mahmud patronized the notable poet Ferdowsi, who after laboring 27 years, went to Ghazni and presented the Shahnameh to him. There are various stories in medieval texts describing the lack of interest shown by Mahmud to Ferdowsi and his life&#x27;s work. According to historians, Mahmud had promised Ferdowsi a dinar for every distich written in the Shahnameh (which would have been 60,000 dinars), but later retracted his promise and presented him with dirhams (20,000 dirhams), at that time the equivalent of only 200dinars. His expedition across the Gangetic plains in 1017 inspired Al-Biruni to compose his &quot;Tarikh Al-Hind&quot; in order to understand the Indians and their beliefs. During Mahmud&#x27;s rule, universities were founded to study various subjects such as mathematics, religion, the humanities, and medicine.

The Ghaznavid Empire was ruled by his successors for 157 years. The expanding Seljuk empire absorbed most of the Ghaznavid west. The Ghorids captured Ghazni in 1150, and Mu&#x27;izz al-Din (also known as Muhammad of Ghori) captured the last Ghaznavid stronghold at Lahore in 1187.

Despite Mahmud&#x27;s remarkable abilities as a military commander, he failed to consolidate his empire&#x27;s conquests with subtle authority. Mahmud also lacked the genius for administration and could not build long term enduring institutions in his state during his reign.

The military of Pakistan has named its short-range ballistic missile the Ghaznavi Missile in honour of Mahmud of Ghazni. In addition, the Pakistan Military Academy, where cadets are trained to become officers of the Pakistan Army, also gives tribute to Mahmud of Ghazni by naming one of its twelve companies Ghaznavi Company.

==Personality==

Sultan Mahmud thought of himself as &quot;the Shadow of the God on Earth&quot;, an absolute power whose will is law. He paid great attention to details in almost everything, personally overseeing the work of every department of his divan (administration).

Mahmud appointed all his ministers himself without advising his wazir (chief advisor) or diwan, though occasionally he had to, as his religion dictated that Muslims should consult each other on all issues. Most of the time he was suspicious of his ministers, particularly of the wazir, and the following words are widely believed to be his: &quot;wazirs are the enemies of kings...&quot; Sultan Mahmud had numerous spies (called ) across his empire, supervised by the special department within his diwan.

Mahmud was a patron of literature, especially poetry, and he was occasionally found in the company of talented poets either in his palace or in the royal garden. He was often generous to them, paying unstintingly for their works according to their talent and worth.

<doc id="651865" wikidata="Q2032124" url="?curid=651865" title="Reboly">
<text>Reboly (, , ) is a settlement in the Republic of Karelia of the Russian Federation by the Finnish border, located southeast of Kuhmo and northeast of Lieksa. In 1926 the settlement had a population of 1,465, in 2010 - 258 people.

== History ==
Reboly was first mentioned in 1555; by 1679 it was the center of a district with 23 villages and 220 households. Its location on the Russo-Swedish border led to several cases in which the village was destroyed by Swedish detachments. In the nineteenth century it became an often-visited site by Finnish nationalist scholars, such as Elias Lönnrot, Matthias Castrén and D. E. D. Europaeus.

After the Finland&#x27;s declaration of independence the settlement and its district became an issue in Finnish-Russian relations when its predominantly Karelian population held a vote in August 1918 to join Finland. The Finnish Army moved to occupy Reboly in October. In the Treaty of Tartu, 1920, Finland gave up its claims on Reboly and the neighbouring Porosozero, and instead received Petsamo in the far north, which had been annexed by Finnish trooрs in 1918.

The anti-Soviet sentiment in Reboly was still strong, and in 1921, after the Red Army re-took Reboly and Porosozero, local pro-Finnish activists formed a short-lived resistance movement known as the Metsäsissit (literally &quot;Forest Guerillas&quot;). Together with Finnish volunteers, they were instrumental in the East Karelian uprising of 1921–1922.

During the negotiations prior to the Winter War, the Soviet government offered Reboly and Porosozero in exchange for a smaller area on the Karelian Isthmus. The offer was rejected.

Reboly was occupied from 1941 to 1944 by the Finnish 14th Division during the Continuation War, until it was recaptured by Soviet forces.

<doc id="651866" wikidata="Q455442" url="?curid=651866" title="Firuz Shah Tughlaq">
<text>Firuz Shah Tughlaq (; 1309 – 20 September 1388) was the 3rd Sultan of the Tughlaq dynasty, ruling from 1351 until his death in 1388. He succeeded his cousin Muhammad bin Tughlaq following the latter&#x27;s death at Thatta, Sindh. His father was Sipahsalar Rajab, the brother of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, the founder of the dynasty, whilst his mother was a Bhatti taking origins in Abohar, Dipalpur in the Punjab region. 

Firuz Shah has been accredited with the construction of numerous cities and irrigation projects and has been regarded as a great builder with the creation of Firozpur, Hisar and Fatehabad in the Punjab and Haryana regions. Firuz Shah&#x27;s reign was met with numerous conquests such as against the Raja&#x27;s of Bengal, Sindh and Kangra later in his reign, whilst upon receiving the throne it has been noted he successfully repelled a Mongol attack.

==Background==
The Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi is one of the main sources of information regarding the Sultan&#x27;s background, early life and the origins of his parents. It was narrated that Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq longed for his brother, Sipahsalar Rajab, to marry the daughter of one of the Rai&#x27;s of Dipalpur in Punjab and was later informed of the beauty of one Rana Mall Bhatti&#x27;s daughter called Bibi Naila. Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq sent a proposal of marriage to the Rai however he declined which led the Sultan to demand the payment of revenue for a year causing hardship to the people for three days until Bibi Naila heard the cries of her mother due to the severity caused by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq and ultimately accepted his proposal. Upon marrying Sipahsalar Rajab her name was changed to Sultan Bibi Kadbanu. When Firuz Shah was seven years old, his father Sipahsalar Rajab had died and was then raised by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq. The addition of &#x27;Tughlaq&#x27; to his name has been reported to have been a modern alteration out of convenience, that Persian and contemporary sources only used the name &#x27;Firuz Shah&#x27; when referring to him.

Firuz Shah was mentored by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq and Muhammad bin Tughluq in the handling of affairs of the state and the duties and functions held by the royalty. When he was fourteen years of age, Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq succeeded the throne of Delhi and he travelled with the Sultan, learning the arts of public affairs. Upon Muhammad bin Tughluq&#x27;s succession to the throne, Firuz Shah, now around sixteen years of age, had assumed the rank of &#x27;deputy of the lord chamberlain&#x27; (Naib-i Amir Hajib) with the title of Naib Barbak, commanding twelve thousand horses.

==Reign==

Upon Muhammad bin Tughluq&#x27;s death, Firuz Shah succeeded the throne on 23 March 1351, on the banks of Sindh. According to the Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, a group of Mongols had plundered a baggage train and were advancing to Firuz&#x27;s camp leading to a battle wherein the latter was victorious and the captives secured by the Mongols set free. The defeated Mongols fled their camps back to their own countries, securing Firuz Shah&#x27;s first victory as emperor. During this time it was thought by the Khwaja-i-Jahan of the empire through misinformed intelligence that Firuz Shah was missing and presumed dead, causing him to place an imposter son of Muhammad bin Tughluq on the throne but upon finding out that Firuz was alive he gathered an army of twenty thousand at Delhi until peace was made. Firuz hearing of this unanimously agreed with his nobles that Muhammad bin Tughluq had only one daughter and thence marched through Multan, Dipalpur and Ajodhan, gathering a large army of soldiers, nobles, and commoners from these cities for his march to Delhi, including thirty six Rajas of this region, he also completed a pilgrimage to the tomb of Baba Farid. According to this same tradition, whilst marching to Delhi, Firuz received a son, naming him Fath Khan and founded the town of Fatehabad after him at the place of his birth. The Khawaja-i-Jahan had set to Fatehabad and sued for peace pleading with Firuz for his mistake, securing Firuz&#x27;s rule.

=== Attempted regicide ===
A daughter of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, Khudawand-zada, alongside her husband, conspired to murder Firuz, out of jealousy, when he came to visit her next. It was a custom of Firuz Shah to visit Khudawand-zada after Friday prayers but seeing hidden signals being made on his visit, he left her palace and took the sword from a Rai Chirhu Bhatti, one of his nobles, confronting her soon after and demanding her immediate retirement in addition to the exile of her husband. 

=== Conquests ===

==== First invasion of Bengal ====
In 1353, Firuz Shah set to invade the region of Bengal ruled by Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah and camped on the banks of the Kosi River with over seventy thousand men. During this time the ruler of Gorakhpur submitted to Firuz and payed a tribute of over twenty thousand Tankas. Firuz Shah&#x27;s army crossed the Kosi River causing Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah to flee with his army to Ekdala, West Bengal. He soon after besieged the city but feigned a retreat leading to Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah to leave the city with his army to harass the Sultans retreat. The sultans army was secretly split into three divisions led by Tatar Khan, Malik Dillan and Malik Hisam Nawa and an assault was led on the Bengal army causing one hundred and eighty thousand casualties to Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah and his eventual retreat. Tatar Khan attempted to persuade Firuz to annex Bengal however he declined, stating that previous Delhi sultans had annexed it however it was not prudent due to the marshy lands of the region. Two years after the invasion of Bengal, Firuz built the city of Hisar and before his second invasion constructed the city of Firozabad on the banks of the Yamuna river.

==== Second invasion of Bengal ====
Preceding Firuz&#x27;s invasion, the king of Sonargaon was slain by Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah and his son-in-law Zafar Khan had fled to the court of Firuz in Hisar with preprations soon made in Delhi to avenge Zafar Khan&#x27;s claims. Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah upon hearing of Firuz Shah&#x27;s preperations for war, had fled from Ekdala to Sonargaon, deeper in Bengal for a securer position. Like the first invasion Firuz had amassed an army of seventy thousand men and marched towards Bengal in 1358, creating the city of Jaunpur named after the second sultan of the Tughlaq dynasty, Muhammad bin Tughluq during his expedition. Simultaneously, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah had died and was succeeded by his son Sikandar Shah who was then to be besieged at Ekdala by the Delhi army. The outcome of the war led to the creation of a peace treaty with Sikandar Shah under the condition that Zafar Khan was to regain his dominion in Sonargaon which was accepted, both Firuz Shah and Sikandar Shah would send gifts including elephants and horses to commemorate the treaty.

On the return from Bengal, Firuz Shah was met with conflict from the Rai of Jajpur, modern day Odisha and in 1360 had invaded the region taking prisoners and spoils of war, such as horses and cattle, meanwhile the Rai of Odisha had surrendered and sued for peace promising an anual tribute of 20 elephants.

==== Conquest of Kangra ====
Firuz received reports that the Rai of Kangra had invaded his kingdom and plundered some of his districts, initiating his march to Nagarkot. Whilst passing through the city of Sirhind, he built a canal connecting the Sarasvati River with the Markanda River and constructed a fort named Firuzpur. The Rai of Kangra secured himself in a fort at Nagarkot and taking advantage, the Sultan&#x27;s army had plundered the country of Kangra and besieged the fort of the Rai for six months until he surrendered himself, but was permitted to retain his kingdom under the Fiefdom of Firuz.

The Nurpur kingdom centred in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh under Kailas Pal (1353–1397), who ruled alongside Firuz Shah, had been noted as a great ally of the Tughlaq dynasty. It had been written that Tatar Khan, a Khorasanian governor, had been defeated with his face slashed by Kailas Pal and was killed by the Gakhars upon his invasion of the Punjab, 5000 Mansabdar was gifted to him as a reward for this victory. Kailas Pal is also stated to have consutructed an irrigation channel from the Ravi River to Pathankot. The Nurpur kingdom supposedly converted to Islam during the reign of Firuz Shah according to records and Firuz had also converted the Chauhan Rajputs from Hinduism to Islam.

==== Conquest of Thatta ====
In 1362, Firuz Shah set for Thatta, modern day Sindh, with ninety thousand horses and 480 elephants whilst collecting a large fleet of boats to accompany the army down the Indus River for his conquest. Firuz&#x27;s horses suffered a great disease which wiped out three quarters of them and he decided to retreat to Gujarat to regain his strength and gather more horses. During the retreat, his army lacked food and his soldiers began to starve, the situation further worsened after &#x27;treacherous guides&#x27; had led them to where there was no fresh water, causing some of their executions which induced the rest of the guides to lead the army to the fertile plains of Gujarat. In 1363, Firuz, after re-strengthening his forces, continued his expedition launching a suprise assault on Thatta, which inclined the people who were tilling their lands to apply a scorched earth policy, destroying their fields and taking shelter in mud forts west of the Indus River. Firuz dispatched two of his garrisons to cross the river and besiege the town but without much luck they were forced to retreat and gather more forces from Delhi. During this time the Delhi army reaped the crops from the conquered lands, replenishing food supplies whilst starving out the forces of Thatta causing the rulers to submit to Firuz with an annual tribute of four hundred thousand Tankas to be sent to Delhi.

=== Death ===
Due to his senile state, Firuz Shah had abdicated the throne to his son Muhammad Shah III in 1387 but after devoting his rule to pleasure and abstaining from royal duties, the Delhi nobles had set out against Muhammed causing Firuz to confer the royal titles upon his grandson, Tughluq Khan, the son of his deceased son Fath Khan, who died in 1374. A year later in 1388, Firuz had passed away at the age of 78 or 79 after a rule of thirty seven years. His tomb is located in Hauz Khas, Delhi, close to the tank built by Alauddin Khalji and attached to the tomb is a madrasa built by Firuz in 1352–53.

== Legend of Firuz Shah ==
According to legends the Gujari Mahal situated in Hisar, Haryana is where the story between Firoz Shah and his lover, a lady of the Gurjar tribe, took place.

According to the story, when one day Firuz went out for hunting he felt thirsty in the dense forest, but there was a great shortage of water there as the land there was sandy and uneven. Firoz was so thirsty that he fell down from the horse and fainted. During this time, a girl of the Gurjar tribe was passing from there who used to work as a milkmaid. When she saw him lying unconscious, she fed some milk to Sultan. Due to which Firuz regained consciousness.

After this, he started visiting this place often. Whenever the Sultan went for hunting, he would visit the Gurjar colony. Soon, Emperor Firoz Shah Tughlaq and Gujari became good friends. Later when Firoz ascended the throne, he went to her village and proposed to Gujari and asked her to accompany him to the throne of Delhi but Gujari refused to leave Hisar as she thought she would not be treated rightly by the other queens of Sultan. It is said that Emperor shifted his court from Delhi to Hisar to marry Gujari and there he built this special palace for his lover Gujari after their marriage. She became the favourite wife of Firuz.

==Administrative policies==
Firuz was a Sufi Muslim who tried to uphold the laws of Islam and adopted Sharia policies. He made a number of important concessions to theologians. He tried to ban practices that the orthodox theologians considered un-Islamic, an example being his prohibition of the practice of Muslim women going out to worship at the graves of saints. He persecuted a number of sects that were considered heretical by the Muslim theologians. Firuz took to heart the mistakes made during his cousin Muhammad&#x27;s rule. He recognised the Deccan&#x27;s independance and was indiscriminately benevolent and lenient as a sultan.
Rather than awarding position based on merit, Firuz allowed a noble&#x27;s son to succeed to his father&#x27;s position and jagir after his death. The same was done in the army, where an old soldier could send his son, son-in-law or even his slave in his place. He increased the salary of the nobles. He stopped all kinds of harsh punishments such as cutting off hands. He also lowered the land taxes that Muhammad had raised. Firuz&#x27;s reign has been described as the greatest age of corruption in medieval India: He once gave a golden tanka to a distraught soldier so that he could bribe the clerk to pass his sub-standard horse.

Firoz Shah&#x27;s reign was marked by both administrative reforms and aggressive religious policies aimed at consolidating Islamic rule in India. A devout Muslim, he is known for his efforts to enforce Sharia law, which included widespread persecution of Hindus and destruction of their religious institutions. Firuz renovated Surya kund in the Dakshinaarka sun temple of Gaya and acknowledged its greatness. It has an inscription mentioning his name twice.

=== Infrastructure and education ===
Firuz instituted economic policies to increase the material welfare of his people. Many rest houses (&quot;sarai&quot;), gardens and tombs (Tughluq tombs) were built. He commissioned many public buildings in Delhi. He built the Firoz Shah Palace Complex at Hisar in 1354, over 300 villages and dug five major canals, including the renovation of the Prithviraj Chauhan era Western Yamuna Canal, for irrigation bringing more land under cultivation for growing grain and fruit. Firoz Shah founded several cities around Delhi, including Jaunpur, Firozpur, Hissar, Firozabad, Fatehabad. Most of Firozabad was destroyed as subsequent rulers dismantled its buildings and reused the spolia as building materials, and the rest was subsumed as New Delhi grew. When the Qutb Minar was struck by lightning in 1368, knocking off its top storey, he replaced them with the existing two floors, faced with red sandstone and white marble. One of his hunting lodges, Shikargah, also known as Kushak Mahal, is situated within the Teen Murti Bhavan complex, Delhi. The nearby Kushak Road is named after it, as is the Tughlaq Road further on. He brought two Ashokan Pillars from Meerut, and a Topra near Radaur in Yamunanagar district of Haryana, carefully cut and wrapped in silk, to Delhi in bullock cart trains. He re-erected one of them on the roof of his palace at Firuz Shah Kotla.

Hindu religious works were translated from Sanskrit to Persian and Arabic. He had a large personal library of manuscripts in Persian, Arabic and other languages. A number of madrasas (Islamic religious schools) were opened to encourage the religious education of Muslims. He set up hospitals for the free treatment of the poor and encouraged physicians in the development of Unani medicine. He provided money for the marriage of girls belonging to poor families under the department of Diwan-i-Khairat.

<doc id="651868" wikidata="Q543525" url="?curid=651868" title="Chabrias">
<text>Chabrias (; bef. 420–357 BC) was an Athenian general active in the first half of the 4th century BC. During his career he was involved in several battles, both on land and sea.  The orator Demosthenes described him as one of the most successful commanders Athens ever had:To sum up the whole: he is the only general who never lost a single city or post or ship or soldier, when he commanded you: none of your enemies has any trophy over you and him, while you have many over many enemies under his command.

== Family ==
Little is known of Chabrias&#x27; background, except that his father&#x27;s name was Ctesippus and that he was rich enough to be subject to the liturgy, having been a trierarch in 377–376 BC. He is known to have had one other son, also named .

== Career ==

===Corinthian War (395–387 BC)===
Chabrias’s first appearance in the historical record was his appointment as &quot;strategos&quot; (general) in 390–89 during the Corinthian War (so called because most of the fighting took place in and around Corinth). In this conflict, Athens joined a coalition including Thebes, Corinth, and Argos to challenge Sparta&#x27;s dominance and unfair treatment of various cities in Greece. His first assignment in the spring of 389 was to replace his fellow general Iphicrates as commander of the Athenian garrison at Corinth when Iphicrates was recalled to Athens.

Within the year the garrison itself was recalled and in 388 BC Chabrias was given command of a small fleet (ten ships and 800 peltasts) to assist King Evagoras of the city of Salamis on the island of Cyprus, who was attempting to secede from the Persian empire. At the time, the Spartans had stationed a garrison on the island of Aegina which was harassing Athenian shipping through the Saronic Gulf and raiding small villages on the Attic coast. On his outbound leg, Chabrias staged a night time landing on Aegina to set up an ambush. The next morning a second Athenian force under Demainetos landed and openly marched inland. The Spartan garrison came out to attack them and was caught in the trap. The garrison commander Gorgopas was killed, along with hundreds of Spartan and Aegetinian troops. The Attic coast was then free from raids and Athens had command of the sea once again – at least for the time being.

The Corinthian War ended with a peace agreement imposed on Greece by the Great King of Persia, Artaxerxes II (also known as the Peace of Antalkides, for the Spartan diplomat who negotiated it). This cessation in fighting left those Greeks inclined to mercenary service free to participate in wars outside their homeland. Chabrias took advantage of this situation and sometime in the 386-384 BC period, without official sanction from the Athenian government, hired himself out to the Egyptian king Hakor to lead the Greek mercenary force the king had assembled for his attempt to break away from Persian control. Then, as Diodorus Siculus tells it:Pharnabazus, who had been appointed by the King general of the Persian armies, prepared large supplies of war material, and also sent ambassadors to Athens, first to denounce Chabrias, who by becoming general of the Egyptians was alienating, so he said, the King&#x27;s affection from the people of Athens, and, secondly, to urge them to give him Iphikrates as general. The Athenians, being eager to gain the favor of the Persian King and to incline Pharnabazus to themselves, quickly recalled Chabrias from Egypt and dispatched Iphikrates as general to act in alliance with the Persians.Though Chabrias&#x27; participation on the Egyptian side of the conflict was embarrassing to Athens, it did not seriously harm his long-term career. He was shortly called back into service.

===Boeotian War (378–371 BC)===
In the winter of 379–8 BC, Thebes and Sparta went to war over Thebes efforts to unite Boeotia into a federated state. Sparta had previously occupied Thebes’ Cadmeia, killed the leaders of the anti-Spartan faction in the city and were supporting by force a pro-Spartan regime.  This winter, exiled Thebans living in Athens returned to their city and killed the Spartan commander, along with the Theban politicians complicit with them, and forced the Spartan garrison to quit the city. Sparta responded by sending an army under the command of one of its kings, Cleombrotus, to reestablish the status quo. To prevent this army from passing through Attica on its way north, Chabrias was dispatched to the border region to guard the road that led through Eleutherai. This forced Cleombrotus to enter Boeotia by another route.

Athens soon joined the war on the Theban side and in the spring of 378 BC, King Agesilaos II of Sparta led an army of eighteen thousand Peloponnesians into Boeotia to attack Thebes. Chabrias was dispatched with a mercenary force of five thousand to assist the Thebans in holding off the attack. Taking a position at the top of a ridge near the city, the combined Theban/Athenian army waited as the Peloponnesians approached. The first wave of the attack was by the Spartan peltasts and was easily repulsed. Agesilaos ordered his hoplites to attack next and as they began to climb the ridge, Chabrias gave a signal and the whole Athenian force, joined by the Theban Sacred Band, instantly stood at ease – shields leaning on each soldier&#x27;s left knee and spears resting on the ground, pointing upward. It was a gesture of contempt, but it also spoke to the high level of discipline of the troops and gave Agesilaos pause. Rather than attack such a force while climbing uphill, he recalled his forces and left the field. Though the Peloponnesians were free to ravage the surrounding country, Thebes itself was safe. It was a moral and psychological victory for Thebes, and...This device was so extolled by fame throughout Greece, that Chabrias chose to have the statue, which was erected to him at the public charge by the Athenians in the &quot;agora&quot;, made in that posture. Hence it happened that wrestlers, and other candidates for public applause, adopted, in the erection of their statues, those postures in which they had gained a victory. In 378 BC, Athens began building what is called the Second Athenian Confederacy. Cities from all over Greece signed on, including almost all those on the island of Euboea. Histiaia, at the north end of the island, was the one holdout, due to Athens having driven out the citizens in 446 and established a Cleruchy there.  

After the Peloponnesian War, Sparta had restored the city to its original citizens and they were not now inclined to join with the rest of the island in joining Athens’ new league.  Athens, wishing to complete its alliance with all the cities of Euboea, sent Chabrias to deal with the situation. As Diodorus tells it,Chabrias, in command of the force dispatched by the Athenians, laid waste Histiaia, and, fortifying its Metropolis, as it is called, which is situated on a naturally steep hill, left a garrison in it, and then sailed to the Cyclades and won over Peparethos and Sciathos and some other islands which had been subject to the Lacedaemonians. Two years later (376 BC), after another expedition into Boeotia, the Sparta&#x27;s Peloponnesian allies prevailed upon it to institute a naval blockade of Athens rather than put them through another long march to the north. This Sparta attempted to do, and initially was successful in stopping grain shipments into the port of Piraeus.  Athens soon sent Chabrias out to break up the Spartan fleet. The battle, which took place off the island of Naxos, went to the Athenians and shipments resumed. It is worth noting that when Chabrias had the remnants of the Spartan fleet on the run, he held back his ships so they could retrieve those in the water, both living and dead. As Diodorus relates:For he recalled the Battle of Arginusae (406 BC) and that the &quot;ekklesia&quot;, in return for the great service performed by victorious generals, condemned them to death on the charge that they had failed to bury the men who had perished in the fight; consequently he was afraid, since the circumstances were much the same, that he might run the risk of a similar fate. Accordingly, refraining from pursuit, he gathered up the bodies of his fellow citizens which were afloat, saved those who still lived, and buried the dead. Had he not engaged in this task he would easily have destroyed the whole enemy fleet. In the battle eighteen triremes on the Athenian side were destroyed; on the Lakedaimonian side twenty-four were destroyed and eight captured with their crews. Chabrias then, having won a notable victory, sailed back laden with spoils to the Peiraieus and met with an enthusiastic reception from his fellow citizens. Since the Peloponnesian War this was the first naval battle the Athenians had won.In appreciation for this victory, and for his service to the city to date, the Athenians granted Chabrias and his descendants &quot;ateleia&quot;, or freedom from the liturgies (providing warships, as his father had done, or choruses for dramatic productions, or managing and funding a gymnasium, etc.). To Chabrias’ credit, he did not insist of this exemption, later serving as trierarch in c. 365 and choregos sometime after 360.

Diodorus reports a further action by Chabrias the following year (375 BC) in Thrace. The Triballi, an inland tribe suffering from a famine, invaded the region around Abdera, a coastal city, ravaging the land with impunity. On their way home, the Abderites attacked them, killing some two thousand. The Triballi later retaliated and, drawing the Abderites into a trap, the latter were–butchered almost to a man, as many as took part in the fight. But just after the Abderites had suffered so great a disaster and were on the point of being besieged, Chabrias the Athenian suddenly appeared with troops and snatched them out of their perils. He drove the barbarians from the country, and, after leaving a considerable garrison in the city, was himself assassinated by certain persons.This last event is clearly an error, for Chabrias lived another eighteen years.  

In the spring of 373 BC, Chabrias &quot;won the race at the Pythian games with his chariot and four, which he purchased from the sons of Mitys the Argive, and, on his return from Delphi, gave a banquet to celebrate the victory at Kolias (a promontory on the Attic coast south of Athens). From the historian Hypereides we learn that Chabrias owned a mansion. Using the location of this banquet, it is reasonable to suggest that it was located not in Athens, but along the coast south of the city.

In 371 BC, Thebes defeated the Spartan army at Leuktra and the whole military balance of power in Greece changed. Thebes was now the dominant power and repeatedly invaded the Peloponnese to consolidate its new-found power.  In the course of these invasions it liberated the helots, those peoples of Messene who had been Spartan slaves for centuries. Seeing Thebes thus become the aggressor, Athens concluded a mutual defense treaty with Sparta, which still had allies in the Peloponnese. In 369 BC Thebes planned an expedition into the Peloponnese and Chabrias was dispatched with an army to Korinth to help the Spartans and their allies repel it.  The combined armies created a defensive line across the isthmus outside the city but the Thebans punched through and proceeded to ravage the countryside from Troezen and Epidauros in the south to Sikyon in the north. They eventually returned to Korinth and managed to force their way through the gates into the city. Chabrias and his Athenians drove them out again.In the rivalry which followed, the Boeotians gathered all their army in line of battle and directed a formidable blow at Korinth; but Chabrias with the Athenians advanced out of the city, took his station on superior terrain and withstood the attack of the enemy. The Boeotians, however, relying upon the hardihood of their bodies and their experience in continuous warfare, expected to worst the Athenians by sheer might, but Chabrias&#x27; corps, having the advantage of superior ground in the struggle and of abundant supplies from the city, slew some of the attackers and severely wounded others. The Boeotians, having suffered many losses and being unable to accomplish anything, beat a retreat. So Chabrias won great admiration for his courage and shrewdness as a general and got rid of the enemy in this fashion.

===Oropos Affair===
Chabrias is not known to participate extensively in Athenian politics, but he was at times associated with Callistratus, one of the leading politicians of this time.  For example, Iphikrates had selected both men to join him in his expedition to Corcyra in 372. (Xenophon vi.2.39) Then, in 366, the two men incurred the enmity of certain partisans in the Athenian assembly by counseling the city not to go to war over the Theban acquisition of the coastal village of Oropos in the northwest corner of Attica.  Control of the area had shifted back and forth between Athens and Thebes for generations, and at the time in question was an Athenian territory. Certain exiles from the village had induced Themison, tyrant of Eretria in Euboea, to take control so they could return. Athens sent a regiment out to take it back, but by the time it got there, Thebes had stepped in and taken it for themselves.  

In the later Assembly debate over to what to do, Kallistratos and Chabrias advised restraint, expecting that the situation could be resolved diplomatically.  When Thebes refused to cede control, the two men were brought up on charges.  The specifics are not clear, but in ancient Athens anyone could sue anyone for almost anything. The eloquence of Callistratus saved them this time, but five years later Kallistratos was indicted a second time and condemned to death in absentia, he having left town before the trial.

In the late summer of 362 Chabrias once again went to the aid of an Egyptian king (Tachos) in revolt against Persia. This time he joined the aging Spartan King Agesilaos who had been sent by Sparta to command the infantry. Chabrias was to command the king&#x27;s navy. As before, Chabrias went on his own, without the sanction of the Athenian assembly, but this time no embarrassing recall was forthcoming. During this affair, Agesilaos transferred his allegiance to a rival for the Egyptian throne, Nektanebos, and Tachos was later compelled to flee to Persia and seek asylum with Artaxerxes. What Chabrias did during this internal revolt is not recorded.  

There is a brief mention in an oration of Demosthenes of Chabrias being sent on a mission to the Chersonese in 359/8 with one vessel in an abortive attempt to help an Athenodoros, an ally who capitulated to his enemies for lack of funds from Athens.

=== Social War (357–355 BC) and the death of Chabrias ===
In 357 four members of the Athenian Confederacy (Byzantium, Rhodes, Chios, and Kos) suffered internal revolts in which their democratic governments were overtaken by oligarchies, the reported motivation being the heavy-handed way Athens was managing the league. Each city then announced it was seceding from the Confederacy. In the initial action of the war, the Athenian admiral Chares was sent with a fleet to the various cities and set things right. Chabrias was appointed trierarch for this expedition. Cornelius Nepos provides the most complete description of what happened:Chabrias lost his life in the Social War, in the following manner. The Athenians were besieging Chios; Chabrias was on board the fleet as a private man, but had more influence than all who were in command; and the soldiers looked up to him more than to those who were over them. This circumstance hastened his death; for while he was anxious to be the first to enter the harbor, and ordered the captain to steer the vessel towards it, he was the occasion of his own death, since, after he had made his way into it, the other ships did not follow. Upon which, being surrounded by a body of the enemy, his ship, while he was fighting with the utmost bravery, was struck with the beak of one of the enemy&#x27;s vessels, and began to sink. Though he might have escaped from the danger, if he had cast himself into the sea, for the fleet of the Athenians was at hand to take him up as he swam, he chose rather to die, than to throw away his arms and abandon the vessel in which he had sailed. The others would not act in a similar manner, but gained a place of safety by swimming. He, on the other hand, thinking an honorable death preferable to a dishonorable life, was killed with the weapons of the enemy, while he was fighting hand to hand with them.

<text>James Weddell (24 August 1787 – 9 September 1834) was a British sailor, navigator and seal hunter who in February 1823 sailed to latitude of 74° 15′ S—a record 7.69 degrees or 532 statute miles south of the Antarctic Circle—and into a region of the Southern Ocean that later became known as the Weddell Sea.

==Early life==

He was born in Ostend on the Belgian coast, the son of a Scottish sea captain (captains were permitted their wives at sea). He was apprenticed as a seaman (this normally started at age eight) and so received little education, but could at least read and write. He originally worked on merchant ships on the north-east Scottish coast.

He entered the merchant service very early in his life and was apparently bound to the master of a Newcastle collier (a coal transport vessel) for some years. About 1805 he shipped on board a merchantman trading to the West Indies, making several voyages there.

In 1808 he struck his captain, which was considered a severe crime, and was handed to the Royal Navy for punishment. This proved a positive rather than negative step. He studied navigation during his imprisonment and on release joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He rose rapidly through the ranks, becoming captain.

He was aboard in 1813 in the English Channel when she captured the &quot;Young True Blooded Yankee&quot;, a small American privateer. With the end of the Napoleonic War he was laid off on half pay in February 1816, and for a while resumed merchant voyages to the West Indies. In 1819 he was paid off in full from the Royal Navy.

==Voyages to the Antarctic==
In 1819 Weddell was introduced to James Strachan, a shipbuilder of North Leith, a partner of &quot;Strachan &amp; Gavin&quot; shipbuilders.

Strachan, together with James Mitchell, a Scottish insurance broker living in London, owned the 160-ton brig , an American-built ship taken during the War of 1812 and re-fitted for sealing. News of the discovery of the South Shetland Islands had just broken, and Weddell suggested that fortunes might be made in the new sealing grounds. His first voyage as the captain of the &quot;Jane&quot; took him to the Falkland Islands and further south. He returned with the holds full, and the voyage was so profitable that Strachan and Mitchell had a second ship, the &quot;Beaufoy&quot;, built.

The next voyage from 1821 and 1822 took both ships to the South Shetland Islands. However, there were some 45 sealers operating in the area, and seal were already becoming rare (a mere two years after the discovery of the islands), and so he scouted for new hunting grounds.

Michael McCleod, the captain of the &quot;Beaufoy&quot;, sighted the South Orkney Islands on 22 November 1821, an independent discovery from that of Powell and Palmer just a few days earlier. There, they hunted for seals, and arrived back in England in July.

On the third voyage from 1822 to 1824, Weddell again commanded the &quot;Jane&quot;, while the captain of the &quot;Beaufoy&quot; was one Matthew Brisbane. Together they sailed to the South Orkneys again. Sealing proved disappointing, though, and after searching for land between the South Shetlands and the South Orkneys (and not finding any), they turned south in the hope to better sealing ground. The season was unusually mild and tranquil, and on 20 February 1823, the two ships had reached latitude 74°15′S and longitude 34°16′45″W (−74.25, −34.279): the southernmost position any ship had ever reached up to that time. A few icebergs were sighted, but there was still no sight of land, leading Weddell to theorize that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days&#x27; sailing would have brought him to Coats Land (to the east of the Weddell Sea), but Weddell decided to turn back.

After deciding to go back, Weddell cheered the crew with the announcement of being southward of any former navigator and held a little ceremony; the colours were hoisted, a gun was fired, both crews gave three cheers, and an allowance of grog dispelled the gloom. A hope was infused that fortune might yet favor the crew of sealers. The area was named &quot;The Sea of George the Fourth&quot;, but the naming did not become permanent. The region would not be visited again until 1911, when Wilhelm Filchner discovered the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf.

Weddell returned north and sheltered at South Georgia, where he and his crews searched for the elusive seal. They wintered at the Falklands and sailed again for the South Shetlands in November 1823. At the beginning of 1824, the two ships separated. Weddell returned in March 1824 to the Falklands and headed back to England, where he arrived in July.

The Weddell seal was discovered and named in the 1820s during expeditions led by James Weddell.

His record for a southerly voyage, three degrees beyond that of James Cook, caused some raised eyebrows. Weddell was persuaded by Strachan and Mitchell to incorporate everything in a book. The first edition appeared in 1825, followed by second enlarged edition in 1827, incorporating some information from the &quot;Beaufoy&quot; which had returned to England in 1826.

Weddell appears to have been resident in Edinburgh, Scotland in the summer of 1826, when he was cited for non-payment of a debt of £245, loaned to him by the Commercial Bank. As his name appears on no directory in this period he was either living with a friend or relative.

Papers now in the National Archives of Scotland show that he and his sponsors appear to have fallen out over liability for payment, and is probably more than coincidence that the navigational instruments taken by Weddell on board, cost, according to his book, £240. The Leith merchants engaging him may have felt that these were unnecessary for a sealing expedition, yet Weddell has been criticised by such historians as David Walton for failing to take more instruments, not fewer. The legal papers fail to indicate what happened to the debt.

He was certainly in Edinburgh in February 1827 as he was elected an Ordinary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, requiring his physical presence (were he not present he would have been elected an Honorary Fellow). His proposer was Admiral Norwich Duff.

==Later life==
Weddell offered his services to the Admiralty with a proposal for a return voyage to the high southern latitudes, but was turned down. Instead, he returned to trading along the warmer Atlantic coasts. In 1829 he was again master of the &quot;Jane&quot;, but on a passage from Buenos Aires to Gibraltar &quot;Jane&quot; leaked so badly that she had to be given up at the Azores. Weddell and his cargo were transferred to another ship for the passage to England, but this ran aground on the island of Pico, and Weddell only barely survived.

The loss of the &quot;Jane&quot; meant financial ruin for Weddell, who was forced to take paid employment as a ship&#x27;s master. In September 1830 he left England as master of , bound for the Swan River Colony in western Australia. From there he proceeded to Tasmania. He sailed back to England in 1832.

Weddell died on 9 September 1834 at the age of forty-seven. Although perhaps less affluent and famous than might be expected, he died in his house at Norfolk Street off the Strand in London. He was buried in the churchyard of St Clement Danes in the Strand, very close to his home.

==Commemorations==
Three places are named after him – the Weddell Sea, Weddell Islands in the South Orkney Islands, and Weddell Island in the Falklands. Also the Weddell seal is named after him.

<text>Peachtree Street is one of several major streets running through the city of Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Beginning at Five Points in downtown Atlanta, it runs North through Midtown; a few blocks after entering into Buckhead, the name changes to Peachtree Road at Palisades Road. Much of the city&#x27;s historic and noteworthy architecture is located along the street, and it is often used for annual parades, (such as the Atlanta St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade and Atlanta Christmas Parade), as well as one-time parades celebrating events such as the 100th anniversary of Coca-Cola in 1986 and the Atlanta Braves&#x27; 1995 and 2021 World Series victories.

==History==

Atlanta grew on a site occupied by the Creek people, which included a major village called Standing Peachtree. There is some dispute over whether the Creek settlement was called Standing Peachtree or Standing &quot;Pitch&quot; Tree, corrupted later to &quot;peach&quot;. Pine trees, common to the area, were also known as pitch trees due to their sap.

A trail known as the Peachtree Trail stretched from northeast Georgia to Standing Pitch Tree along the Chattahoochee River. The original Peachtree Road began in 1812 at Fort Daniel located at Hog Mountain in present-day Gwinnett County and ran along the course of the trail to the Chattahoochee. Some portions of the present road trace this route.

After the American Civil War a shantytown named Tight Squeeze developed at Peachtree at what is now 10th Street in Midtown Atlanta. It was infamous for vagrancy, desperation, and robberies of merchants transiting the settlement.

In 1867, the name of Whitehall Street, the original road to White Hall Tavern in today&#x27;s West End neighborhood, was changed to Peachtree Street from Marietta Street south to the railroad crossing (now &quot;gulch&quot;) just north of Alabama Street. Later in the 1980s, the portion of Whitehall Street from Five Points south to Forsyth Street and Memorial Drive, a major shopping district from the Civil War through mid-20th century, was renamed Peachtree Street SE. 

In 2007, Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin unveiled a $1 billion, 20-year plan to transform Peachtree Street with streetscape upgrades, public parks, buried utilities, and the addition of a streetcar, based on a sixteen-month study by the Peachtree Corridor Partnership task force.

==Nomenclature==
The Peachtree name is common throughout the Atlanta area. In fact, it is often joked by natives that half of the streets in Atlanta are named Peachtree, and the other half have five names to make up for it. While “Peachtree” alone almost always refers to this street or its continuations, there are 71 streets in Atlanta with a variant of “Peachtree” in their name. Some include:
* Peachtree Creek Road
* Peachtree Lane
* Peachtree Avenue
* Peachtree Circle
* Peachtree Place
* Peachtree Drive
* Peachtree Plaza
* Peachtree Way
* Peachtree Memorial Drive
* New Peachtree Road
* Peachtree Walk
* Peachtree Park Drive
* Peachtree Parkway
* Peachtree Valley Road
* Peachtree Battle Avenue (commemorating the Battle of Peachtree Creek)
* Peachtree Dunwoody Road (running between Peachtree Street and Dunwoody, Georgia)
* Old Peachtree Road (traces part of the route of the original Peachtree Trail for which the road is named; in Gwinnett County.) 

Peachtree is also seen in place names: 
* Peachtree Center is a major development of skyscrapers and other high-rises in downtown, with Peachtree Center Avenue running a block east of Peachtree Street.
* Peachtree City is a planned-suburb golf community located south of the city, in Fayette County.
* Peachtree Corners is also a planned suburb located north of the city, in Gwinnett County.

===West Peachtree Street===
West Peachtree Street is not a western branch of Peachtree Street, but a major parallel (and unlike Peachtree, almost perfectly straight) due north–south street running one block west of Peachtree Street through downtown, and mostly two or three blocks west (due to the curves in Peachtree Street) through Midtown. West Peachtree divides the northeast and northwest quadrants of the city and county for street addressing purposes.

Where the current Peachtree Street turns to Peachtree Road and briefly heads northwest, it actually crosses West Peachtree, leaving it on the &quot;east&quot; side. It is at this point that the Buford-Spring Connector (Georgia 13) begins, taking the route of old I-85. The studios of WSB-TV are located on this section of “West” Peachtree Street , which terminates at I-85. The MARTA Red/Gold lines run directly under West Peachtree Street. The Civic Center MARTA Station is located under West Peachtree street where the road crosses the Downtown Connector 
(I-75/85) The station is notable as it is among a very small number of subway stations in the world that are simultaneously above a highway and below street level.

The intersection of the two Peachtree streets in downtown form Hardy Ivy Park, while in midtown, the intersection forms Pershing Point Park.

==Route numbers==
From the Buford–Spring Connector north to Roswell Road, Peachtree Street and Peachtree Road carry U.S. Route 19 (US 19) and State Route 9 (SR 9). At a five-way intersection with East/West Paces Ferry Road at the center of the original Buckhead Village, US 19 and SR 9 split off onto Roswell Road, while SR 141 begins on Peachtree instead. South of the connector, US 19 and SR 9 continue on two one-way streets: West Peachtree Street northbound and Spring Street southbound.

Peachtree meets Piedmont Road (SR 237) between Buckhead Village and Lenox Square. Besides the southwestern terminus of SR 13 (mentioned above) the only other major intersection in Atlanta is at North Avenue, which carries US 29, US 78, US 278, and SR 8.

There are no direct highway interchanges from Peachtree to the Downtown Connector (I-75/I-85), I-85 itself, or SR 400 freeways, all of which it crosses.

==Landmarks==

Many of Atlanta&#x27;s most prominent buildings and landmarks are located along Peachtree Street. In downtown, 191 Peachtree Tower, Georgia-Pacific Tower, Westin Peachtree Plaza and SunTrust Plaza all line Peachtree. In Midtown, Bank of America Plaza, Atlanta&#x27;s tallest building, is a block south of the &quot;Fabulous&quot; Fox Theatre, a grand movie palace completed in 1929.

Author Margaret Mitchell was killed by a speeding car in 1949 while crossing Peachtree Street as a pedestrian at the intersection with 13th Street. Mitchell wrote her classic &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; in the basement apartment of a boarding house at the corner of 10th Street and Peachtree Street. That house is now a museum and is located across 10th Street from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta which serves the southeastern United States. The film debuted at the Loew&#x27;s Grand Theatre, at the corner of Peachtree and Forsyth Street, where the Georgia-Pacific Building now stands.

Office buildings 1100 Peachtree (formerly owned and occupied by BellSouth) and 1180 Peachtree, home to major law firms, are prominent business addresses. The heart of Atlanta&#x27;s arts scene is found just north on Peachtree where the Woodruff Arts Center, including the High Museum of Art, Atlanta Symphony, Alliance Theatre Company, and the Atlanta campus of the Savannah College of Art &amp; Design are located.

Although most have been demolished, there are still several historic buildings left along Peachtree in Buckhead. Several of these are stores, in single-story brick buildings constructed well before the annexation of Buckhead in 1952.

Northeast of the city limit, the road goes through Brookhaven and passes Oglethorpe University. Upon entering Chamblee, the road splits into Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and Peachtree Road. Peachtree Road becomes a two-lane road that travels farther east towards Doraville, while Peachtree Industrial Boulevard continues more on a more northerly trajectory (as Georgia 141) towards Dunwoody and Peachtree Corners.

==Retail==
The Buckhead shopping district features many high-end retailers, concentrated in the Phipps Plaza and Lenox Square malls. Buckhead Atlanta (formerly &quot;Streets of Buckhead&quot;) is a mixed-use development that opened in 2014. The &quot;Midtown Mile&quot; was a concept to make part of Peachtree in Midtown like the Magnificent Mile in Chicago.

==Geography==

Atlantans are often convinced that the ridge followed by Peachtree Street is part of the Eastern Continental Divide. While Peachtree Street is atop a ridge, railroad tracks were built on the actual Eastern Continental Divide, which follows DeKalb Avenue from Decatur to Five Points, then turns southwest toward the Atlanta airport, with the northwest side draining into the Chattahoochee or Flint Rivers and therefore into the Gulf of Mexico, and the southeast side eventually into the Atlantic Ocean. In 1959, Whitehall Street SW, which meets Peachtree Street NE at Five Points, was renamed &quot;Peachtree Street SW&quot;, and the Eastern Continental Divide follows this street, so a small portion of the story may be technically correct. Atlanta&#x27;s primary water source is the Chattahoochee and much of the water is pumped over the watershed. To balance the river flows, treated sewage is pumped back to the Chattahoochee.

==In popular culture==
*In Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s epic Civil War romance &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara lives on various points of Peachtree Street along the novel. Coincidentally, it is also where the author herself was struck by a speeding automobile in Midtown, causing her death.
*Frank Sinatra co-wrote a song with Jimmy Saunders and Leni Mason called &quot;Peachtree Street&quot; in 1950. He recorded it as a duet with Rosemary Clooney.
*Sir Elton John kept a home on Peachtree Road in Buckhead, for which his 2004 album &quot;Peachtree Road&quot; was named, from 1991 to 2023.
*John Mayer references Peachtree Street in his song &quot;Neon.&quot;

<text>Homecoming is the third album by jazz trio Gateway, consisting of guitarist John Abercrombie, bassist Dave Holland and drummer Jack DeJohnette, recorded in December 1994 and released on ECM—the trio&#x27;s first release since &quot;Gateway 2&quot; (1978).

== Reception ==

An AllMusic review by Greg Turner stated &quot;The Gateway Trio is a cooperative in the greatest sense of the word... Even though this only the third Gateway recording and the group&#x27;s first in 17 years, each group member collaborates frequently with the others. As a result there is always a great sense of interplay between Abercrombie&#x27;s sometimes-mellow-sometimes-distorted guitar, Holland&#x27;s huge toned bass, and DeJohnette&#x27;s dancing drums... This is a fine return to recording for a great group&quot;. A separate AllMusic review by jazz critic Scott Yanow stated: &quot;the high improvisational level makes this a set deserving of close listens.&quot;

Regarding the album&#x27;s title track, Tyran Grillo wrote: &quot;The joy in every lick and tumble is in full evidence. DeJohnette is aflame, Abercrombie following his trail of embers with laser precision and shaving off an twist of lime for his solo, while Holland... is at his buoyant best.&quot; Concerning the album as a whole, he commented: &quot;If only we could get a taste of this alchemy in our drink, we might all live beyond our time. Invigorating and fine, &quot;Homecoming&quot; is a joy to explore time and again.&quot;

<doc id="651884" wikidata="Q625420" url="?curid=651884" title="Perfect (grammar)">
<text>The perfect tense or aspect (abbreviated &#x27; or &#x27;) is a verb form that indicates that an action or circumstance occurred earlier than the time under consideration, often focusing attention on the resulting state rather than on the occurrence itself. An example of a perfect construction is &quot;I have made dinner.&quot; Although this gives information about a prior action (the speaker&#x27;s making of the dinner), the focus is likely to be on the present consequences of that action (the fact that the dinner is now ready). The word &quot;perfect&quot; in this sense means &quot;completed&quot; (from Latin &quot;perfectum&quot;, which is the perfect passive participle of the verb &quot;perficere&quot; &quot;to complete&quot;).

In traditional Latin and Ancient Greek grammar, the perfect tense is a particular, conjugated-verb form. Modern analyses view the perfect constructions of these languages as combining elements of grammatical tense (such as time reference) and grammatical aspect. The Greek perfect tense is contrasted with the aorist and the imperfect tenses and specifically refers to completed events with present consequences; its meaning is thus similar to that of the English construction, &quot;have/has (done something)&quot;. The Latin perfect tense is contrasted only with the imperfect tense (used for past incomplete actions or states) and is thus used to mean both &quot;have/has done something&quot; and &quot;did something&quot; (the preterite use). Other related forms are the pluperfect, denoting an event prior to a past time of reference, and the future perfect, for an event prior to a future time of reference.

In the grammar of some modern languages, particularly of English, the &quot;perfect&quot; may be analyzed as an aspect that is independent of tense – the form that is traditionally just called the perfect (&quot;I have done&quot;) is then called the present perfect, while the form traditionally called the pluperfect (&quot;I had done&quot;) is called the past perfect. (There are also additional forms such as future perfect, conditional perfect, and so on.) The formation of the perfect in English, using forms of an auxiliary verb (&quot;have&quot;) together with the past participle of the main verb, is paralleled in a number of other modern European languages.

The perfect can be denoted by the glossing abbreviation or . It should not be confused with the perfective aspect (), which refers to the viewing of an action as a single (but not necessarily prior) event. To avoid confusion with the perfective, the perfect is occasionally called the retrospective ().

==As an aspect==
In some analyses, the &quot;perfect&quot; is identified as one of the grammatical aspects. In the perfect aspect, the event being referred to is viewed as already completed at the time of reference. It should not be confused with the perfective aspect, which marks a situation as a single event &quot;without internal structure&quot;, and does not imply prior occurrence or present relevance as the perfect aspect does. The perfect also contrasts with the prospective aspect, which encodes the present relevance or anticipation of a future event. While the perfect is a relatively uniform category cross-linguistically, its relation to the experiential and resultative aspects is complex – the latter two are not simply restricted cases of the perfect.

The perfect is not necessarily incompatible with other grammatical aspects. In English, for example, it can be combined with the progressive (continuous) aspect, wherein an event is viewed as temporary and ongoing. A form such as the present perfect progressive &quot;I have been working&quot; combines the meanings expressed by the two aspects – viewing my working as an ongoing process, but one which is now completed (or, as in &quot;I have been working for two hours&quot;, restricting attention to the completed portion of that process).

If perfect is viewed as an aspect, then the verb forms traditionally called just &quot;perfect&quot; (as in Greek or – in appropriate contexts – in Latin) in fact combine the perfect aspect with present tense (the event occurred prior to the time of speech). The pluperfect and future perfect forms combine perfect aspect with past and future tense respectively. This analysis is reflected more explicitly in the terminology commonly used in modern English grammars, which refer to present perfect, past perfect and future perfect (as well as some other constructions such as conditional perfect).

However, not all uses of &quot;perfect&quot; verb forms necessarily express this &quot;perfect aspect&quot; – sometimes they are simply used as expressions of past tense, that is, as preterites. This applies to some uses of the Latin perfect, and also (for example) to the modern German &quot;Perfekt&quot;.

==Types==
In English, several uses of the perfect aspect have been recognized:
* Resultative perfect (referring to a state in the present which is the result or endpoint of an event in the past): 
:: &quot;I have lost my pen-knife&quot; (message: I still don&#x27;t have it)
* Continuative perfect (past situations continuing into present):
:: &quot;I have always guided him&quot; 
* Anterior perfect (completed past situations, but with relevance to the present):
:: &quot;It has rained&quot; (implication: the streets are wet now)
* Experiential perfect (stating that a given situation has occurred at least once in a period of time leading up to the present time):
:: &quot;Bill has been to America&quot;
:: &quot;I have seen that film three times now&quot;
* Universal perfect (stating that a given situation has been going on continuously during a period leading up to the present time):
:: &quot;The meaning of the Perfect has been debated for 200 years&quot;

In other languages other uses of the perfect are found:
* Perfect of present state (stating that a present situation holds as a result of something that has happened recently):
:: (Swahili) &#x27;he is tired&#x27; (lit. &#x27;he has become tired&#x27;)
:: (Swahili) &#x27;he is standing&#x27; (lit. &#x27;he has stood up&#x27;). This can be considered to be the same as resultative perfect. 
* Perfect of very recent past:
:: (Alicante Spanish) &#x27;(An hour ago) I was walking in the forest. Suddenly I stepped on a snake. It bit me in the leg.&#x27; (lit. &#x27;I have stepped on a snake ... it has bitten me&#x27;). 
* Evidential or inferential perfect (a statement that something must have happened because of the evidence available):
:: (Swedish) &#x27;The thief evidently got in through this window&#x27; (literally, &#x27;has got in&#x27;)
* Reportative perfect (referring to an event which the speaker has heard about but not personally witnessed). This is common in languages such as Turkish, Persian, Georgian, and Bulgarian:
:: (Turkish) &#x27;They say I was/am ill&#x27; (literally, &#x27;I have been ill&#x27;)

==Discontinuous past==
In some languages a type of tense has been noted with exactly the opposite implication to a perfect. This type of tense is known as discontinuous past. Thus if a sentence such as &quot;I have put the book on the table&quot; implies that it is still on the table, so a discontinuous past sentence &quot;I put the book on the table&quot; in these languages would imply that the book is no longer on the table.

==Construction with auxiliaries==
A number of modern European languages exhibit a parallel type of perfect (or perfect-like) construction, formed with an auxiliary verb in combination with the past participle of the main verb. The auxiliary may be a verb meaning &quot;have&quot; (as in the English &quot;I have won&quot;) or a verb meaning &quot;be&quot; (as in the French , &quot;I (have) arrived&quot;, literally &quot;I am arrived&quot;).

The &quot;have&quot;-perfect developed from a construction where the verb meaning &quot;have&quot; denoted possession, and the past participle was an adjective modifying the object, as in &quot;I have the work done&quot;. This came to be reanalyzed, with the object becoming the object of the main verb, and the participle becoming a dependent of the &quot;have&quot; verb, as in &quot;I have done the work.&quot; The construction could then be generalized to be used also with intransitive verbs. A vestige of the original interpretation is preserved in some languages in the form of inflection on the participle to agree with the gender and number of the object.

The &quot;be&quot;-perfect developed similarly, from a construction where the verb meaning &quot;be&quot; was an ordinary copula and the participle expressed a resultative state of the subject. It is consequently used mostly with verbs that denote a change in the state or location of the subject, and in some languages the participle inflects to agree with the gender and number of the subject.

Languages that use these constructions can generally inflect the auxiliary to produce different verb forms for the perfect aspect: the pluperfect or past perfect is produced with the auxiliary in the past tense, the future perfect with the auxiliary in the future tense, and so on. These include non-finite forms such as perfect infinitives. (More possible forms and examples are given under below.)

The basic (present) perfect form, with the auxiliary in the present tense, may specifically carry the meaning of perfect aspect, as in English; however in some languages it is used more generally as a past tense (or preterite), as in French and German.

The use of auxiliaries and meaning of the constructions in various languages are described below.
* English uses &quot;have&quot; as the auxiliary; the use of &quot;be&quot; with some intransitive verbs (as in &quot;I am come&quot;; &quot;he is gone&quot;) is archaic. For more details see the section on below.
* German uses (&quot;have&quot;) as the auxiliary with most verbs, and (&quot;be&quot;) with some intransitives, including the copula itself. The German &quot;present perfect&quot; construction is called the (perfect), and for most verbs is the usual past tense for colloquial speech and dialects. For details, see German verbs. Other Germanic languages have similar constructions, such as the of Swedish and the (compound past) of Dutch.
* French uses (&quot;have&quot;) as the auxiliary with most verbs, but uses (&quot;be&quot;) with reflexive verbs and with a certain number of intransitive verbs. The past participle is inflected to agree in gender and number with the subject when is used, and with a direct object when is used, but then only when the object precedes the verb (which is normally the case with personal pronouns and in some relative and interrogative clauses). The construction with &quot;present perfect&quot; form is called the (compound past) and is the usual past tense for completed events, corresponding to both the English present perfect and to the simple past. For more details see .
* Italian uses (&quot;have&quot;) and (&quot;be&quot;) as auxiliaries, distributed in much the same way as and in French. The participle agrees with the subject when is used, and with a preceding pronoun direct object when is used. The present perfect is often used also for completed events where English would use the simple past. For details see Italian grammar.
* Spanish uses (&quot;have&quot;) as the auxiliary with all verbs. The &quot;present perfect&quot; form is called the and is used similarly to the English present perfect. While (&quot;to be&quot;) was used as an auxiliary verb in a similar sense to modern French and Italian, this use disappeared by the 18th century. See Spanish verbs.

Celtic languages (except Cornish and Breton) have a somewhat different type of perfect construction, where a word meaning &quot;after&quot; is used together with a verbal noun. This is described under Welsh grammar and Irish conjugation. By analogy with this construction, sentences of the form &quot;I&#x27;m after eating&quot; (meaning &quot;I have eaten&quot;) are used in Irish English. Middle Cornish and Middle Breton used a perfective particle &quot;re&quot; with the preterite to express a present perfect sense, although this has largely fallen out of use in the modern languages, being replaced with periphrastic formations using the verbs &quot;to be&quot; or &quot;to have&quot; with a past participle.

==In particular languages==

===Proto-Indo-European===
In reconstructions of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), the verb form that has traditionally been called &quot;perfect&quot; in fact signified stative aspect (a current state of being). The name was assigned based on similarity to the Greek or Latin perfect tense, before the stative nature of the form was fully recognized. For details of its formation, see Proto-Indo-European verbs.

===Ancient Greek===
The Ancient Greek perfect developed from the PIE perfect (stative) form; in both cases the stem is typically formed by reduplication. In Greek, however, it took on a true &quot;perfect&quot; meaning, indicating an action with a permanent result. The effect of the action is seen in the resulting state; this state may belong to either the subject or the object. The meaning is therefore similar to the English present perfect, although usage of the Greek perfect is rather narrower than in English. Greek also has a pluperfect and a (compound) future perfect, although their use is rare.

Other verb forms used in Ancient Greek to refer to past circumstances were the aorist, which was used simply to report past events (for example in narrative), and the imperfect.

For details of the formation and use of the Greek perfect, see Ancient Greek verbs (see also ). For the (compound) perfect found in modern Greek, see Modern Greek verbs.

===Latin===
In Latin the PIE aorist merged with the perfect. Consequently, the Latin perfect tense serves both as a true perfect (meaning, for example, &quot;I have done&quot;), and as a simple preterite, merely reporting a past event (&quot;I did&quot;). It contrasts with the imperfect, which denotes uncompleted past actions or states.

Latin also has pluperfect and future perfect forms. For details of how all of these forms are made, see Latin conjugation.

===English===
The English perfect is made with a form of the auxiliary verb &quot;have&quot; together with the past participle of the main verb. The auxiliary is inflected for tense and mood, and can also appear in non-finite forms (infinitive, participle or gerund), thus giving rise to a number of constructions which combine the perfect aspect with other verbal properties:
*&quot;I have eaten&quot;; &quot;he has eaten&quot; (present perfect, generally denoting something that took place prior to the present moment)
*&quot;I had eaten&quot; (past perfect, something that took place prior to a moment in the past)
*&quot;I will have eaten&quot; (future perfect, something to take place prior to a moment in the future)
*&quot;I would have eaten&quot; (conditional perfect, something conceived as taking place in hypothetical past circumstances)
*&quot;Have [your dinner] eaten&quot; (perfect imperative) 
*&quot;...that he have eaten...&quot; (present perfect subjunctive, a rarely used form; see English subjunctive)
*&quot;(to) have eaten&quot; (perfect infinitive)
*&quot;having eaten&quot; (perfect gerund or participle)

The perfect can also be combined with another aspect that is marked in English – the progressive (or continuous) aspect. In perfect progressive (or perfect continuous) constructions, the perfect auxiliary (a form of &quot;have&quot;) is followed by the past participle &quot;been&quot; (from &quot;be&quot;, the auxiliary of the progressive aspect), which in turn is followed by the present participle of the main verb. As before, the perfect auxiliary can appear in various tenses, moods and non-finite forms:
*&quot;I have been eating&quot;; &quot;he has been eating&quot; (present perfect progressive)
*&quot;I had been eating&quot; (past perfect progressive)
* etc.

The perfect aspect (or perfect progressive) can also be combined with marking for the passive voice. Perfect passive forms can be constructed by replacing the participle of the main verb with the corresponding participle of &quot;be&quot; followed by the past participle of the main verb: &quot;it has been eaten&quot;; &quot;it will have been eaten&quot;; &quot;it has been being eaten&quot;. Perfect progressive passives, as in the last example, therefore involve two consecutive participles of the auxiliary verb &quot;be&quot;; these constructions are rarely used.

The implications of the present perfect (that something occurred prior to the present moment) are similar to those of the simple past. The simple past is generally used when the occurrence has a specific past time frame – either explicitly stated (&quot;I wrote a book in 1995; &quot;the water boiled a minute ago), or implied by the context (for example, in the narration of a sequence of events). The present perfect, on the other hand, is used when the assumed time frame lasts up until the present moment: &quot;I have written two novels&quot; (in my lifetime; I am still alive); &quot;You have done no work this morning&quot; (it is still the morning). It is often used to draw attention to the consequences rather than the action: &quot;I&#x27;ve built a tree-house&quot; (the time of building is not important; the focus is on the result, the present existence of the tree-house).

Perfect progressive forms are used mainly to refer to an action continuing up to (or nearly up to) the time of reference, again with emphasis on its consequences (&quot;we were tired because we had been running&quot;), or its duration (&quot;we have been working for ten hours/since 7 o&#x27;clock&quot;). They may express interrupted activities (&quot;I had been writing a novel when she came to talk to me&quot;).

The perfect infinitive (without &quot;to&quot; in most cases) can be used after modal verbs with various meanings, chiefly to express modality with regard to past events: &quot;you should have done that&quot;; &quot;she might have seen it&quot;. With &quot;would&quot; (and sometimes &quot;should&quot; and &quot;could&quot;), it forms a contrary-to-fact past conditional (conditional perfect), as in &quot;she would/could have done it if she had tried&quot;. (These verb forms might not be considered to be truly in the perfect aspect.) For more information on such constructions, see English modal verbs (particularly the sections on the individual modals).

<text>Raymond Allen Draper (August 3, 1940, New York City – November 1, 1982) was an American jazz tuba player.

==Early life and education==
Draper was born in New York City and attended the Manhattan School of Music in the mid-1950s.

== Career ==
As a leader, he recorded his first album, &quot;Tuba Sounds&quot; (Prestige 1957), at the age of 16, with a quintet. His second album, &quot;The Ray Draper Quintet featuring John Coltrane&quot;, was recorded at the age of 17 with slight changes in his quintet, including John Coltrane.

Imprisoned over his drug use, after his release in the late 1960s, Draper formed the first jazz rock fusion band composed of established jazz musicians of the day. This preceded Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, which is normally recognized as the first jazz rock fusion group and recording by two years. Original band members included George Bohanon on trombone, Hadley Caliman on tenor sax, John Duke on upright bass, Paul Lagos on drums and Tom Trujillo on guitar. This band, after its first live performance at Hollywood&#x27;s Whisky a Go Go - where it shared the bill with Nazz - was offered numerous record deals and booked solid at rock venues for the rest of the year. Paul Lagos went on to tour with John Mayall and was one of the founders of the group Pure Food &amp; Drug Act, featuring Don &#x27;Sugarcane&#x27; Harris.

Draper began using heroin again, whereupon the more experienced band members quit, except for the youngest member, guitarist Tom Trujillo and his landlord, Chuck Gooden. This led to a search for new members and hirings that included San Diego trumpeter Don Sleet and Ernie Watts. After two years of searching and many personnel changes, including getting clean from drugs, Draper brought drummer Paul Lagos back, along with saxophonist Richard Aplanalp, trumpeter Phil Wood, and bassist Ron Johnson. This new group was eventually named Red Beans and Rice, named after their favorite meal cooked by Draper&#x27;s first wife, Cassondra. This group appeared on bills with some of the day&#x27;s headlining groups including Jimi Hendrix, Chicago Transit Authority, Jethro Tull, and Gil Scott Heron. In a 1970 &quot;Billboard&quot;, reviewing a Dr. John performance mentioned that &quot;His excellent support included Ray Draper on tuba...&quot;.

They went on to record the album produced by Jackie Mills titled &quot;Red Beans and Rice Featuring Sparerib Ray Draper&quot; on Epic Records. But when the band saw that Draper and his manager Forrest Hamilton had put only Draper&#x27;s picture on the cover, the whole group quit and Draper was on his own once more. After this, he got hooked back on heroin and he sporadically performed and recorded but he was no longer able to recreate the band sound with other players. He left California and spent a couple years in London before returning to New York in the hopes of becoming clean once again. He remarried and had two children, Kayella and Hakim, with his second wife, Anne, continuing to compose for other musicians. 
Draper played for a time with Max Roach, as mentioned in the 2004 book, &quot;Drummin&#x27; Men&quot;: &quot;For a time, the Roach group included a tuba, played by young, talented Ray Draper. The instrument was used both as a rhythmic presence and as part of the front-line sound.&quot; In 1982, Draper joined the orchestra of Lionel Hampton.

In 1982, coming out of a bank in Harlem, he was held up by a gang of juveniles. The 13-year-old leader of the gang shot him, after Draper had given him his money. Draper had been clean of drug use and was working on a composition, found in his attaché case upon his death.

<text>Pagurus pollicaris is a hermit crab commonly found along the Atlantic coast of North America from New Brunswick to the Gulf of Mexico. It is known by a number of common names, including gray hermit crab, flat-clawed hermit crab, flatclaw hermit crab, shield hermit crab, thumb-clawed hermit crab, broad-clawed hermit crab, and warty hermit crab.

&quot;P. pollicaris&quot; inhabits the shells of shark eye snails and whelks. It grows to a length of and a width of . The shell is often shared by the commensal zebra flatworm (&quot;Stylochus ellipticus&quot;).

The diet of the flat-clawed hermit crab comprises organic matter, algae, and sometimes other hermit crabs. Fish are the most important predators of this species.

<doc id="651888" wikidata="Q2028879" url="?curid=651888" title="Breda 30">
<text>The Fucile Mitragliatore Breda modello&quot; 30also known as Breda 30 or the Alpine scythe (la falce degli Alpini) or Finita Burrasca (The storm is over)&quot; was the standard light machine gun of the Royal Italian Army during World War II. The Breda Modello 30 was issued at platoon level and gave Italian rifle squads extra firepower. As a light machine gun it had many problems including jamming and overheating. It was fed by a 20 round stripper clips which had to be oiled by a lubrication device. Despite all its faults it formed the main base of fire for infantry units during the war.

==Design==
The Breda 30 was rather unusual for a light machine gun. It was fed from a fixed magazine attached to the right side of the weapon and was loaded using brass or steel 20-round stripper clips. If the magazine or its hinge/latch were damaged the weapon became unusable. It also fired from a closed bolt along with using short recoil for its action. The rotating bolt was locked by six radially-arranged lugs (reminiscent of, e. g., AR-15, Mondragón rifles or George Fosbery&#x27;s shotgun).

The recoil operation was violent and often resulted in poor primary extraction. In the primary extraction phase of automatic firearms cycling, the initial small rearward movement of the hot expanded cartridge case away from the chamber&#x27;s walls should be powerful but not too rapid, otherwise reliability problems may arise. Separated cases resulting in jamming of the Breda were usually the consequence of poor primary extraction, and this was often difficult to remedy in the field. The Breda 30 inherently lacked good primary extraction in its design, and thus utilized a small lubrication device that oiled each cartridge as it entered the chamber. The dust and sand of the deserts of North Africa caused significant premature wear and jamming.

As an automatic weapon&#x27;s chamber and barrel heat up with prolonged automatic fire, the resulting excessive temperature can cause a chambered round to &quot;cook off,&quot; or ignite without intent of the gunner. As a result of firing from a closed bolt, the Breda 30 could not fully take advantage of the cooling properties of air circulation like an open bolt weapon would, thus making cooked off rounds a realistic hazard. The disastrous results could lead to potential injuries to or even the death of the gunner. Some Bredas were eventually modified to accept the new 7.35 mm Carcano cartridge, which the Italian military was making an effort to adopt; however, this was short-lived as slowed production never allowed full adoption of the new cartridge.

==Service history==
In regular army units, one Breda 30 was issued to each squad (standard issue was 24 to 27 per battalion), although this was later changed to two weapons per squad. An Italian infantry company therefore had about six light machine guns in the early years of World War II (two per platoon), but this number eventually increased to twelve for the majority of the war (four per platoon).

An infantry platoon was divided into two large sections, each of twenty men, which were further split into rifle and light machine gun squads. The section was commanded by a sergeant, who also controlled the LMG squad. The latter was made up of two Breda 30s, each manned by a corporal gunner, an assistant gunner and two ammunition bearers. The balance of the section was the rifle squad of eleven men. Due to the importance of its extra firepower, the Breda 30 was most often given to the squad&#x27;s most reliable soldier (unlike other armies of the time, it was not rare to see an NCO carrying the squad&#x27;s automatic weapon). The manual indicates that the two squads were to operate as distinct elements, with the two LMGs supporting the rifle squad in its objective. At the time, most other armies embedded a light machine gun with each section or squad, usually half the size of the Italian section, which by comparison seems an unwieldy organisation. As individual weapons, pistols were issued to each corporal gunner, a carbine for the sergeant-major, and rifles for all others.

The Breda 30 was first used in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.

The Wehrmacht adopted the Breda 30 in small numbers after the occupation of Northern and Central Italy following the Italian armistice of 1943 with the Allies, as the MG 099(i); it filled a similar role as the German MG 34, a light machine gun, predominantly utilized in Italian campaign battlefields.

==Combat performance==

The Breda 30 was widely viewed as a poorly designed weapon. It had a low rate of fire, low magazine capacity, used sometimes unreliable ammunition and was highly prone to stoppages. The vital oiling system was very susceptible to allowing dust and debris to get into the action system, making the weapon unreliable in combat conditions. Though the magazine system was designed with the rationale that the feed lips on a detachable magazine are prone to damage, the Breda&#x27;s sole magazine could also become disabled if the hinges or latches were damaged, and the slit on the top for viewing the ammunition count provided another way for debris to enter and jam the magazine.

The Breda&#x27;s rear and fore sight were both on the gun body, so only one barrel could be zeroed and any spare barrels would, when installed, invariably lead to decreased accuracy without re-zeroing the sights. The magazine was loaded using 20-round stripper clips, which were known to be fragile, especially in combat conditions. In North Africa, the weapon&#x27;s full-auto mode was nearly unusable: desert sand and dust caused the weapon to jam continuously, with the oil used in the cartridge lubrication only exaggerating this problem. Because of its highly frequent jamming and stoppages, the Breda, despite being a machine gun, was more comparable to a semi-automatic rifle in terms of fire output. In the Balkans, Eastern Front and other theatres of war, the weapon achieved slightly better results. 

Low magazine capacity, frequent jamming and the complicated barrel change made firing and reloading a slow and laborious process, resulting in the Breda 30 being a weapon only capable of laying down a diminutive amount of firepower and making it a very modest contributor to a firefight. When considering all of the gun&#x27;s deficiencies, taken during combat when it was at its worst, the practical rate of fire of the Breda 30 could even have been comparable to a semi-automatic weapon&#x27;s practical rate of fire, as the standard American rifle was (the M1 Garand and M1 Carbine) and the later German Gewehr 43.

Although considerably flawed when compared to its contemporaries, the Breda 30 was still considered the deadliest weapon of the standard Italian infantryman&#x27;s arsenal, since heavy machine guns were seen in relatively small numbers and submachine guns such as Beretta Model 38 were very rare. The Breda 30 along with the Carcano rifle made up the backbone of the Italian infantry armament during the Second World War. Field reports on the weapon were of mixed nature: the Breda&#x27;s very low rate of fire often resulted in a turning of the tide during a firefight against Italian soldiers; however, the Breda 30, in most occasions, was the fastest and most helpful weapon available. The Italian Army attempted to counter the Breda&#x27;s defects by stressing the importance of the loader&#x27;s role: every soldier was trained to be a Breda 30 loader and taught how to rapidly feed one ammunition strip after another (this was not always possible, as with Breda 30s mounted on motorcycles). Careful polishing was also carried out frequently with extra attention being paid to the Breda&#x27;s lubrication system and ammunition availability.

<text>Melbourne Town Hall, often referred to as simply Town Hall, is the administrative seat of the local municipality of the City of Melbourne and the primary offices of the Lord Mayor and city councillors of Melbourne. Located on the northeast corner of Swanston and Collins street in the central business district of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the building was completed in 1887 and heritage listed on the Victorian Heritage Register in 1974. The building is frequently used for art and cultural events such as concerts, festivals, theatrical plays and exhibitions.

==History==

Melbourne was officially incorporated as a town on 13 December 1842, with Henry Condell as its first Mayor. However, it was not until 1854 that its first Town Hall was completed. Begun in 1851, the work ground to a halt with the beginning of the Victorian gold rush. The foundation stone of a new, grander Town Hall was laid on 29 November 1867 by the visiting Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, after the demolition of the first. The current town hall officially opened on 11 August 1870 with a lavish ball, which was personally funded by the Lord Mayor Samuel Amess.

The foundation stone of the additional front portico was laid in 1887, and Sir Henry Weedon laid the foundation of the administrative annex building on 27 August 1908.

An early cinema event Soldiers of the Cross premiered at the Melbourne Town Hall on 13 September 1900 to an audience of about four thousand people.

In 1913, the city hired a hall keeper in his 30s named James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Dewar, a Scottish immigrant and Black Watch veteran from Dundee. He continued to work there loyally for 30 years. James lived with his wife and family in the Hall&#x27;s penthouse, raising their children there, and retired in 1943. During their upbringing in the Town Hall, their only playing space was a small asphalt yard where the children went &quot;pigeon-nesting&quot; on the roof. 

In his obituary in 1946, The Argus reported that James was a familiar face at the Hall in this era. In his duties, he greeted various visitors from locals to royals, including the French General Paul Pau, the Princes of Wales Edward VIII, and Prince Henry, the Duke of Gloucester. James was described as a &quot;friend, guide, and philosopher&quot; to many Lord Mayors of Melbourne. When opera singer Dame Nellie Melba performed at the Hall in 1928, she wanted to give an encore, but her piano had been packed up and there was no music. James lent her his piano from his upstairs penthouse so she could perform. 

On 1 February 1925, a fire destroyed a large part of the town hall, including the main auditorium and pipe organ valued then at £15,000. It was rebuilt and enlarged, extending east over the site previously occupied by the Victoria Coffee Palace, an early temperance hotel frequented by Melbourne&#x27;s power brokers. The rebuilt section lost some of Reed&#x27;s original flourishes including the elaborate mansard roof.

In 1964, The Beatles attended a civic reception at the Melbourne Town Hall. &quot;Outside 20,000 teenagers had gathered to obtain a glimpse of the pop idols. Again, frenzied and hysterical cheering and uncontrollable screaming erupted when the Beatles emerged.&quot;

==Architecture==
The Town Hall was designed by the famous local architect Joseph Reed and Barnes, in the Second Empire style. Reed&#x27;s designs also included the State Library of Victoria, the Royal Exhibition Building, and Melbourne Trades Hall.

The building is topped by Prince Alfred&#x27;s Tower, named after the Duke. The tower includes a 2.44 m diameter clock, which was started on 31 August 1874, after being presented to the council by the Mayor&#x27;s son, Vallange Condell. It was built by Smith and Sons of London. The longest of its copper hands measures 1.19 m long, and weighs 8.85 kg.

The building and the portico, excluding the interiors, were first classified on the basis of its Venetian Renaissance facade architecture by the National Trust in 1964 and reclassified in 1971. The organ and the 1927 murals by Napier Waller commissioned for £1,700 (a 2021 value of A$138,340.00) are also classified as historically significant at the State level. They were painted directly in line onto the newly installed asbestos Celotex acoustic tiles in a redecoration of the Auditorium after a fire in 1925. Waller, who had been given a free hand in devising the artworks explained that the figures were not intended to be allegorical, but to create rhythm, and that line-work was used because a skin of paint would interfere with the panels&#x27; sound-absorbing quality. The actual painting on the series of 7 metre high by 4m wide wall sections from Waller&#x27;s half-scale cartoons produced in his Darebin studio was undertaken by H. Oliver and Sons under the artist&#x27;s supervision.

==Organ==
The Main Auditorium includes a magnificent concert organ, now comprising 147 ranks and 9,568 pipes. The organ can be played by a fixed console located directly beneath the front pipes or by a secondary mobile console which is placed in close view of the audience for recitals. This organ is of great significance as it is the largest and most comprehensive pipe organ in Australia (measuring by number of voices/stops, the Sydney Opera House organ has more pipes thanks to its entirely &quot;straight&quot; design; there is no borrowing or duplexing at all whereas the Melbourne Town Hall organ makes extensive use of borrowing in the pedal division). The organ is best suited for romantic and symphonic works but is capable of playing just about anything thanks to its vast tonal resources.

=== History of the organ ===

The organ was originally built by Hill &amp; son (of England) in 1872 before a fire destroyed it in 1925. A new organ constructed by Hill Norman &amp; Beard was installed in 1929 and has since then been rebuilt and enlarged by Schantz Organ Company of the United States of America from 1995 to 2001 at a cost of $4.5 million. The rebuild included 2 new floating divisions (Fanfare &amp; Bombarde), many new voices and a secondary moveable console

<doc id="651895" wikidata="Q113627710" url="?curid=651895" title="Continuous and progressive aspects">
<text>The continuous and progressive aspects (abbreviated and ) are grammatical aspects that express incomplete action (&quot;to do&quot;) or state (&quot;to be&quot;) in progress at a specific time: they are non-habitual, imperfective aspects.

In the grammars of many languages the two terms are used interchangeably. This is also the case with English: a construction such as &quot;He is washing&quot; may be described either as &quot;present continuous&quot; or as &quot;present progressive&quot;. However, there are certain languages for which two different aspects are distinguished. In Chinese, for example, &quot;progressive&quot; aspect denotes a current action, as in &quot;he is getting dressed&quot;, while &quot;continuous&quot; aspect denotes a current state, as in &quot;he is wearing fine clothes&quot;.

As with other grammatical categories, the precise semantics of the aspects vary from language to language, and from grammarian to grammarian. For example, some grammars of Turkish count the -iyor form as a present tense; some as a progressive tense; and some as both a continuous (nonhabitual imperfective) and a progressive (continuous non-stative) aspect.

== Continuous versus progressive ==

The progressive aspect expresses the &quot;dynamic&quot; quality of actions that are in progress while the continuous aspect expresses the &quot;state&quot; of the subject that is continuing the action. For instance, &quot;Tom is reading&quot; can express dynamic activity: &quot;Tom is reading a book&quot; – i.e. right now (progressive aspect), or Tom&#x27;s current state: &quot;Tom is reading for a degree&quot; – i.e. Tom is a student (continuous aspect). The aspect can often be ambiguous; &quot;Tom is reading Ulysses&quot; may describe his current activity (it&#x27;s in his hand), or the state of having started, but not yet finished, the book (it&#x27;s in his bag).

== Continuous and progressive in various languages ==

Unless otherwise indicated, the following languages treat continuous and progressive aspects the same, in which case the term continuous is used to refer to both.

=== English ===

==== Use ====

The continuous aspect is constructed by using a form of the copula, &quot;to be&quot;, together with the present participle (marked with the suffix &quot;-ing&quot;). It is generally used for actions that are occurring at the time in question, and does not focus on the larger time-scale. For example, the sentence &quot;Andrew was playing tennis when Jane called him.&quot; indicates what Andrew was doing when Jane called him, but does not indicate for how long Andrew played, nor how often he plays; for that, the simple past would suffice: &quot;Andrew played tennis three hours every day for several years.&quot;

Salikoko Mufwene contrasts the effect of the progressive form on the meanings of action verbs versus those of lexically stative verbs:
:#[I]t converts events expected to be punctual into longer-lasting, even if transient, states of affairs [e.g., &quot;Nancy is writing a letter&quot;];
:# it [con]versely converts those states of affairs expected to last long (lexical statives) to shorter-lasting / transient states of affairs [e.g., &quot;Tom is living with us&quot;]; and 
:# it simply presents those verbs whose denotations are neutral with regard to duration as in process / in (transient) duration [e.g., &quot;The wall is cracking&quot;], though duration is most expected of statives.

==== Origin ====

The progressive aspect in English likely arose from two constructions that were used fairly rarely in Old and Early Middle English. The first used a form of beon/wesan (to be/to become) with a present participle (-ende). This construction has an analogous form in Dutch (see below). The second used beon/wesan, a preposition, and a gerund (-unge), and has been variously proposed as being influenced by similar forms in Latin and French or British Celtic, though evidence one way or another is scant. Over the course of the Middle English period, sound shifts in the language meant that the (-ende) participle ending and the (-unge) gerund ending merged into a new ending, (-ing). This change, which was complete in southern England around the late fifteenth century and spread north from there, rendered participles and gerunds indistinguishable. It is at this point that a sudden increase in the use of progressive forms is visible, though they would not take their current form until the eighteenth century. Linguist Herbert Schendl has concluded that &quot;with this feature, a polygenetic origin ... seems attractive, and at least the further extension of the progressive is a language-internal development.&quot;

=== Berber ===
In the Amazigh language, past continuous is formed by using the fixed participle (original meaning: I forgot); is added before the verb that is in the present tense. So we have:

: he writes / he is writing

: he was writing

Present continuous is usually the same as the present tense. But in the Riff variety of Berber, the participle is added before the verb to form present continuous.

=== Chinese ===
Chinese is one family of languages that makes a distinction between the continuous and progressive aspects.

==== Cantonese ====
Cantonese has a very regular system for expressing aspects via verb suffixes. is typically used to express progressive aspect while is used to express continuous aspect. Take the following example:

In the example, the progressive aspect expresses the fact that the subject is actively putting on clothes rather than merely wearing them as in the continuous aspect. This example is useful for showing English speakers the difference between continuous and progressive because &quot;wearing&quot; in English never conveys the progressive aspect. (Instead, &quot;putting on&quot; must be used).

In Cantonese, the progressive marker can express the continuous aspect as well, depending on the context (so the example above could also mean &quot;I&#x27;m wearing clothes&quot; in addition to &quot;I&#x27;m putting on clothes&quot;), but in general, the progressive aspect is assumed. In order to emphasize the progressive aspect rather than the continuous, (literally meaning &quot;at here&quot;) can be used in front of the verb:

 can also be used without to indicate the progressive aspect.

==== Mandarin ====

Unlike Cantonese, Mandarin does not have a verb suffix for expressing the progressive aspect, but it can use the pre-verbal auxiliary &quot;zhèngzài&quot; (or just ), similar to how Cantonese uses in front of the verb. The continuous aspect does have a verb suffix, &quot;zhe&quot;.

=== Danish ===
Danish has several ways of constructing continuous aspect.

* The first is using the form + infinitive (&quot;is at&quot; meaning &quot;in the process of&quot;). For instance (&quot;he is at to build new house&quot;) meaning &quot;he is building a new house&quot;. This is similar to the German form using &quot;&quot;.
* Some verbs are always or default continuous, for instance verbs indicating motion, location or position, such as (&quot;sitting&quot;), (&quot;standing&quot;), (&quot;lying&quot;) or (&quot;walking&quot;). This means their present tense forms are their continuous forms: (&quot;he stands there&quot;) means &quot;he is standing over there&quot;, and (&quot;I sit down&quot;), means &quot;I am sitting&quot;. Note this means Danish often has two different forms of simple verbs when they make sense both continuous and non-continuous – English has only one such fully functional pair remaining, and it happens to share this one with Danish (&quot;to lay&quot;) and (&quot;to lie&quot;) – &quot;Lay down so you can lie down&quot;.
* Using these default continuous verbs together with a non-default continuous verb makes both continuous. This is a form also used in other Germanic languages such as Norwegian and Dutch. For instance: (&quot;he stands and smokes&quot;) means &quot;he is smoking (while standing)&quot;.
* Another form is used for motions such as walking, driving or flying. When constructing perfect tense they can be constructed with either &#x27;is&#x27; or &#x27;has&#x27;. Where &#x27;has&#x27; indicates a completed travel, and &#x27;is&#x27; indicates a started journey. For instance (&quot;he is walked&quot;) meaning &quot;he has left (on foot)&quot;, versus meaning &quot;I have flown (at some point in time)&quot;.

=== Dutch ===
The continuous aspect is commonly used in Dutch, though not as often as in English. There are various methods of forming a continuous:
* One form is the same as in English: &quot;zijn&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) with the present participle, e.g., &quot;Het schip is zinkende&quot; (&quot;The ship is sinking&quot;). This form puts stress on the continuous aspect and often gives some dramatic overtone, making it not commonly used.
* The second method is the most common in Dutch. It is formed with &quot;zijn&quot;, followed by the preposition and definite article &quot;aan het&quot; and the gerund (verb used as a noun), e.g., &quot;Ik ben aan het lezen&quot; (literally &quot;I am at the reading&quot;), meaning &quot;I am reading&quot;.
* The third method is by using a verb expressing a physical position, like &quot;zitten&quot; (&quot;to sit&quot;), &quot;staan&quot; (&quot;to stand&quot;), &quot;liggen&quot; (&quot;to lie&quot;), followed by &quot;te&quot; and the infinitive. Examples: &quot;Ik zit te lezen&quot; (lit. &quot;I sit to read&quot;), meaning &quot;I am reading (while sitting)&quot;, &quot;Ik stond te wachten&quot; (lit. &quot;I stood to wait&quot;), meaning &quot;I was waiting (while standing)&quot;, &quot;Zij ligt te slapen&quot; (lit. &quot;She lies to sleep&quot;), meaning &quot;She is sleeping (while lying down)&quot;, &quot;Wij lopen te zingen&quot; (lit. &quot;We walk to sing&quot;), meaning &quot;We are singing (while walking)&quot;. When translating into English or another language, the physical position generally isn&#x27;t mentioned, only the action itself. In English, similar constructions exist but are uncommon and marginally more frequent only in certain dialects, e.g. &quot;I sat (there) reading&quot;, &quot;I stood (there) waiting&quot;, etc.
* A fourth method, also available in English, is using &quot;zijn&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) with the adverb and preposition &quot;bezig met&quot; (&quot;busy with&quot;) and the gerund, e.g., &quot;Ik ben bezig met lezen&quot; (lit. &quot;I am busy with reading&quot;), meaning &quot;I am (busy) reading&quot;. If there is an object, there are two forms: 1. the gerund is preceded by the neuter article &quot;het&quot; and followed by the preposition &quot;van&quot; (&quot;of&quot;) and the object, e.g. &quot;Ik ben bezig met het lezen van deze brief&quot; (lit. &quot;I am busy with the reading of this letter&quot;), meaning &quot;I am reading this letter&quot;; 2. the object comes before the full infinitive (instead of the gerund), e.g. &quot;Ik ben bezig met deze brief te lezen&quot; (lit. &quot;I am busy with this letter to read&quot;), meaning &quot;I am reading this letter&quot;. This form of the continuous is mostly used for a real (physical) activity. Grammar-wise, it is possible to say &quot;zij is bezig te denken&quot; (lit. &quot;she is busy to think&quot;, she is thinking) or &quot;hij is bezig te slapen&quot; (lit. &quot;he is busy to sleep&quot;, he is sleeping), but it sounds strange in Dutch. In these cases, other forms of the continuous are generally used, specifically the second method: &quot;Zij is aan het denken&quot; and &quot;hij is aan het slapen&quot;.
* A fifth method also involves the use of &quot;zijn&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) with the adverb &quot;bezig&quot; (&quot;busy&quot;), this time followed by &quot;te&quot; and the infinitive, e.g. &quot;Ik ben bezig te koken&quot; (lit. &quot;I am busy to cook&quot;), meaning &quot;I am cooking&quot;. If there is an object, it comes before the verb, e.g. &quot;Ik ben bezig aardappelen te koken&quot; (lit. &quot;I am busy potatoes to cook&quot;), meaning &quot;I am cooking potatoes&quot;. This form is also mainly used for real activities. &quot;Zij is bezig te denken&quot; and &quot;Hij is bezig te slapen&quot; are uncommon.
* The sixth method is a special form of the continuous. It implicitly means that the subject is away to do an activity. It uses &quot;zijn&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;), followed by the infinitive, e.g., &quot;Zij is winkelen&quot; (lit. &quot;She is shop&quot;), meaning &quot;She is (away) shopping&quot;.

=== French ===

French does not have a continuous aspect per se; events that English would describe using its continuous aspect, French would describe using a neutral aspect. Many express what they are doing in French by just using the present tense. That being said, French can express a continuous sense using the periphrastic construction (&quot;to be in the middle of&quot;) followed by a simple infinitive; for example, English&#x27;s &quot;we were eating&quot; might be expressed in French either as (literally &quot;we were in the middle of eating&quot;), or as simply (&quot;we ate&quot;).

An exception is in relating events that took place in the past: the imperfect (or ) has a continuous aspect in relation to the simple (historic) past (or ); e.g. (&quot;we were eating when he knocked at the door&quot;). However, the compound past () is more often used to denote past events with a neutral aspect in a non-narrative context.

It is also possible to use the present participle (or ) as a &quot;gerund&quot; (or ) in relation to the tense of the opposed verb, e.g. , opposed here to the imperfect but the simple past is also possible, e.g. . In such construction (used without any leading preposition ), the required subject for the &quot;gerund&quot; verb takes the indirect form when it is a pronoun allowing such distinction, so the normal subjects are changed to , e.g. instead of , but 

If the subject of the &quot;gerund&quot; is the same as the opposed verb conjugated at any other tense, it is omitted in the progressive gerund, but implied by the preposition , e.g. (&quot;while eating and while we are discussing, he doesn&#x27;t listen to us&quot;). The preposition may be omitted if the &quot;gerund&quot; has an implied subject and takes an object which is not a pronoun; in that case the object may be prefixed before the &quot;gerund&quot; verb (and its possessive may be omitted when it refers to that implied subject), e.g. (lit. &quot;Path making,&quot; i.e. &quot;While making his path&quot;, &quot;he doesn&#x27;t think about anything&quot;).

Quebec French and Louisiana French often express a continuous sense using the periphrastic construction (lit. &quot;to be after&quot;) followed by a simple infinitive; for example, English&#x27;s &quot;we were eating&quot; might be expressed either as simply with the imperfect () like in France, or as ; but in France, this could be confusively understood as a discontinuous past (lit. &quot;we were after having eaten&quot;, i.e. &quot;we had eaten&quot;), especially in colloquial oral speech, as if the past infinitive (more commonly used with the preposition ) was changed into a simple infinitive with the omitted auxiliary. Haitian Creole offers a similar construction with the adverb &quot;ap&quot;, which is descended from .

==== Jèrriais ====
Formed exactly as in Rhenish German, Jèrriais constructs the continuous with verb &quot;êt&#x27; &quot; (be) + à (preposition) + infinitive. For example, &quot;j&#x27;têmes à mangi&quot; translates as &quot;we were eating&quot;.

=== German ===
There is no continuous aspect in standard German. The aspect can be expressed with &quot;gerade&quot; (&quot;just now, at the moment&quot;) as in &quot;er liest gerade&quot; meaning &quot;he is reading&quot;. Certain regional dialects, such as those of the Rhineland, the Ruhr Area, and Westphalia, form a continuous aspect using the verb &quot;sein&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;), the inflected preposition &quot;am&quot; or &quot;beim&quot; (&quot;at the&quot; or &quot;on the&quot;), and the neuter noun that is formed from an infinitive. This construction was likely borrowed from Low German or Dutch which use the exact construction to convey the same meaning. For example, &quot;ich bin am Lesen&quot;, &quot;ich bin beim Lesen&quot; (literally &quot;I am on/at the reading&quot;) means &quot;I am reading&quot;. Known as the &quot;rheinische Verlaufsform&quot; (roughly &quot;Rhenish progressive form&quot;), it has become increasingly common in the casual speech of many speakers around Germany through popular media and music, although it is still frowned upon in formal and literary contexts. In Southern Austro-Bavarian, the aspect can be expressed using &quot;tun&quot; (&quot;to do&quot;) as an auxiliary with the infinitive of the verb as in &quot;er tut lesen&quot; for &quot;he is reading&quot; (cf. English &quot;he does reading&quot;).

===Hawaiian===
In Hawaiian, the present tense progressive aspect form &quot;ke&quot; + verb + &quot;nei&quot; is very frequently used.

=== Hindi-Urdu ===

Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani) has distinct constructions to convey progressive and continuous actions. Progressive actions are marked through the progressive aspect participle rahā used along with the verb root, while the continuous action is conveyed through the perfective adjectival participle which is constructed by conjugating the verb into its perfective aspect participle and combining it with the perfective aspect participle of the verb honā (to be), which is huā.
=== Icelandic ===
Icelandic possesses a present continuous aspect much like that found in English. This feature is unique among the Scandinavian languages. It is formed with the copula &quot;vera&quot; (to be) + &quot;að&quot; (infinitive marker) + infinite verb. Its usage differs slightly from English, as it generally cannot be used in static contexts, for example standing or sitting, but rather to describe specific activities. The following examples illustrate this phenomenon.
: &quot;Ég er að borða eplið.&quot;
: I&#x27;m eating the apple.
In contrast with:
: &quot;Ég stend á borðinu.&quot;
: I&#x27;m standing on the table.
In the second example, the simple present tense is used as it describes a state, &quot;standing&quot; on the table. The construction *&quot;ég er að standa á borðinu&quot; is incorrect in Icelandic. In addition this method of constructing the continuous present there exists a second method akin to the one which exists in the other Scandinavian languages, where a present participle ending in &quot;-andi&quot; is used along with the copula &quot;vera&quot;. This is a way of using the present participle that is analysed as more adjectival or adverbial than verbal, as it cannot be used with transitive verbs. With certain verbs it also has a frequentative implication, as in the following example:
: &quot;Ég er gangandi í skóla.&quot;
: I walk to school (regularly).
Technically the use of the present participle is often not an example of continuous aspect in Icelandic.

=== Italian ===

Italian forms a progressive aspect in much the same way as in Spanish, using a conjugated form of the auxiliary verb &quot;stare&quot; (&quot;to stay&quot;) followed by the gerund of the main verb. There are only two forms of gerunds, the choice depending upon the ending of the main verb in the infinitive: &quot;-ando&quot; for verbs whose infinitive ends in &quot;-are&quot; (&quot;parlare/parlando&quot;, &quot;mangiare/mangiando&quot;) or &quot;-endo&quot; if the infinitive ends in &quot;-ere&quot; or &quot;-ire&quot; (&quot;leggere/leggendo&quot;, &quot;dormire/dormendo&quot;). Thus &#x27;I am speaking/reading/sleeping&#x27; is expressed &quot;Sto parlando/leggendo/dormendo&quot;.

==== Present tense ====

The present tense and the present progressive can have distinct meanings in Italian. Both can be used for present-time actions in progress: &quot;parlo con Mario&quot; and &quot;sto parlando con Mario&quot; can both mean &#x27;I&#x27;m speaking with Mario (this moment, right now)&#x27;, but only the bare present can be used to express ongoing state, as in &quot;parlo inglese&quot; &#x27;I speak English&#x27;, i.e. to convey the information &#x27;I am able to speak English&#x27; (regardless of what I am doing at the time of speaking). Thus the present progressive clarifies immediacy: &quot;Sto uscendo&quot; &#x27;I&#x27;m leaving (just now; on my way out)&#x27;.

The present continuous is formed by using the present tense of the verb &quot;stare&quot; + the gerund. As in English, the gerund conveys the main meaning of the utterance: &quot;sto pattinando (skating), &quot;I am skating. For the regular verbs, the gerund is formed from the infinitive of the verb by taking the stem and attaching the appropriate gerund suffix: &quot;-are&quot; verbs take &quot;-ando&quot; and the &quot;-ere&quot; and &quot;-ire&quot; verbs both take &quot;-endo&quot;. The table shows the conjugations of &quot;stare&quot; in the present tense with a gerund to exemplify the present continuous:

The present continuous tense has a very predictable conjugation pattern even for verbs that are typically irregular, such as &quot;essere&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) and &quot;avere&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;). For verbs with reduced infinitives, the gerund uses the same stem as the imperfect (which sometimes corresponds to the stem of the 1st person singular indicative present).

==== Past tense ====

To form the past progressive, &quot;stare&quot; is conjugated in the imperfect and used with the gerund. For example, while &quot;sto andando&quot; means &quot;I am going&quot;, &quot;stavo andando&quot; expresses &quot;I was going&quot;. In conventional Italian speaking, &quot;stavo andando&quot; and imperfect &quot;andavo&quot; are mostly interchangeable in the progressive meaning (&quot;stavo andando&quot;/&quot;andavo&quot; &quot;in ospedale&quot;... &#x27;I was going [i.e. on my way] to the hospital...&#x27;), whereas past habitual &quot;I used to go&quot;, &quot;I went (often, repeatedly)&quot; is expressible only with the imperfect &quot;andavo&quot;.

Conjugations of the Past Progressive:

Like the present progressive, the Italian past progressive is extremely regular. Forms of &quot;stare&quot; are those common to &quot;-are&quot; verbs in the imperfect (&quot;stare/stavo&quot;, &quot;parlare/parlavo&quot;, etc.).

There is no readily available means in Italian for expressing the distinction between English &quot;We were reading&quot; and &quot;We have been reading.&quot;

===Japanese===
Standard Japanese uses the same grammar form to form the progressive and the continuous aspect, specifically by using the &quot;-te iru&quot; form of a verb. Depending on the transitivity of the verb, they are interpreted as either progressive or continuous. For example:

Intransitive:
:
:The pen is in the bag (continuous).

Transitive:
:
:He is eating dinner (progressive).
:
:He is putting the pen in the bag (resultative). – this is usually understood to be resultative state as in &quot;he keeps the pen in the bag&quot; but can syntactically be interpreted as progressive, however this is highly strange and pragmatically incorrect.

Some dialects such as Chūgoku dialect and Shikoku dialect have different grammar forms for the progressive and the continuous aspect; the &quot;-yoru&quot; form for the progressive and the &quot;-toru&quot; form for the continuous. For example:

Continuous:
:
:The cherry blossoms have fallen.

Progressive:
:
:The cherry blossoms are falling.

===Pantesco===

In the Pantesco dialect of Sicilian, a progressive aspect can be formed by the use of clitics, which are formed from unstressed versions of the dialect&#x27;s personal pronouns. This structure is unique among Romance languages.

===Portuguese===
In Portuguese the continuous aspect is marked by gerund, either by a proper &quot;-ndo&quot; ending (common in Brazil and Alentejo) or &quot;a&quot; (&quot;to&quot;) and the infinitive (gerundive infinitive – the standard form in most of Portugal); for example &quot;to be doing&quot; would be either &quot;estar a fazer&quot; or, similar to other Romance languages, &quot;estar fazendo&quot;.

===Quechua===
Quechua uses a specific suffix: &quot;-chka&quot; or &quot;-ykaa&quot;; which is directly attached before the conjugation suffixes. Although the continuous aspect in Quechua is similar to that of English, it is more used than the simple tenses and is commonly translated into them (simple present and past), because of the idea that actions are not instantaneous, but they have a specific duration (&quot;mikuni&quot; [I eat] and &quot;mikuchkani&quot; [I am eating] are both correct, but it is preferred to use &quot;mikuchkani&quot; because &quot;we do not eat in a second&quot;).

===Slavic languages===

In Slavic languages, there is a clear distinction between perfective and imperfective grammatical aspects in the verb stem, with the latter emphasizing that the action is, was or will be in progress (habitual or otherwise). It was in relation to these languages that the modern concept of grammatical aspect in general originally developed. The majority of verbs in Slavic languages have at least one complementary verb for both aspects – e.g. Czech &quot;&quot; (perfective; done on a single occasion) and &quot;&quot; (imperfective; done over a longer period of time) which translates as &quot;&quot;to buy&quot; and &quot;be buying&quot;&quot; respectively.

Perfective verbs are commonly formed from imperfective ones by the addition of a prefix; conversely the imperfective verb can be formed from the perfective one by modification of the stem or ending. Suppletion also plays a small role. Perfective verbs generally cannot be used with the meaning of a present tense – their present-tense forms in fact have future reference. An example of such a pair of verbs, from Polish, is given below:
*Infinitive (and dictionary form): &quot;pisać&quot; (&quot;to write&quot;, imperfective); &quot;napisać&quot; (&quot;to write&quot;, perfective)
*Present/simple future tense: &quot;pisze&quot; (&quot;writes&quot;); &quot;napisze&quot; (&quot;will write&quot;, perfective)
*Compound future tense (imperfective only): &quot;będzie pisać&quot; (&quot;will write, will be writing&quot;)
*Past tense: &quot;pisał&quot; (&quot;was writing, used to write, wrote&quot;, imperfective); &quot;napisał&quot; (&quot;wrote&quot;, perfective)

In at least the East and West Slavic languages, there is a three-way aspect differentiation for verbs of motion, with two forms of imperfective, determinate and indeterminate, and one form of perfective. The two forms of imperfective can be used in all three tenses (past, present, and future), but the perfective can only be used with past and future. The indeterminate imperfective expresses habitual aspect (or motion in no single direction), while the determinate imperfective expresses progressive aspect. The difference corresponds closely to that between English &quot;I (regularly) go to school&quot; and &quot;I am going to school (now)&quot;. The three-way difference is given below for the Russian basic (unprefixed) verbs of motion. When prefixes are attached to Russian verbs of motion, they become more or less normal imperfective/perfective pairs, although the prefixes are generally attached to the indeterminate imperfective to form the prefixed imperfective and to the determinate imperfective to form the prefixed perfective. For example, prefix &quot;при-&quot; + indeterminate &quot;ходи́ть&quot; = &quot;приходи́ть&quot;; and prefix &quot;при-&quot; + determinate &quot;идти́&quot; = &quot;прийти&quot; (to arrive (on foot)).

=== Spanish ===
In Spanish, the continuous is constructed much as in English, using a conjugated form of &quot;estar&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) plus the &quot;gerundio&quot; (gerund/gerundive/adverbial participle) of the main verb; for example, &quot;estar haciendo&quot; means &quot;to be doing&quot; (&quot;haciendo&quot; being the &quot;gerundio&quot; of &quot;hacer&quot;, &quot;to do&quot;).

Like English, Spanish also has a few related constructions with similar structures and related meanings; for example, &quot;seguir haciendo&quot; means &quot;to keep doing&quot; (&quot;seguir&quot; being &quot;to continue&quot;).

Conjugations of the Present Progressive in Spanish:

=== Swedish ===
Swedish has several ways of constructing continuous aspect.

* The first is using the form + infinitive (&quot;hold on&quot; meaning &quot;in the process of&quot;). For instance (&quot;I&#x27;m writing a letter&quot;).
* Some verbs are always or default continuous, for instance verbs indicating motion, location or position, such as &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;lie&quot;, &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;stay&quot;. This means their present tense forms are their continuous forms: (&quot;he lies in my bed&quot;) means &quot;he is lying in my bed&quot;, and &quot;she sits in the kitchen&quot; means &quot;she is sitting in the kitchen&quot;. Note this means Swedish often has two different forms to simple verbs when they make sense both continuous and non-continuous – English has only one such fully functional pair remaining, and it happens to share this one with Swedish (&quot;to lay&quot;) and &quot;att ligga&quot; (to lie) – &quot;Lay down so you can lie down&quot; = &quot;&quot;.
* Using these default continuous verbs together with a non-default continuous verb makes both continuous. This is a form also used in other Germanic languages such as Norwegian, Danish and Dutch. For instance: , , and , all mean &quot;he is reading (while lying/standing/sitting/going)&quot;. Also note that these may be in the past tense: , , and , all mean &quot;he was reading (while lying/standing/sitting/going)&quot;.

<text>Pacific Western Airlines Ltd (PWA) was an airline that operated scheduled flights throughout western Canada and charter services around the world from the 1950s through the 1980s.

In 1987, PWA purchased Canadian Pacific Air Lines, and the merged airlines became Canadian Airlines International.

== History ==
Pacific Western Airlines was a pioneer in the aviation history and known for its ability to profitably operate short haul air routes. The company raised profits and reserves and eventually formed Canadian Airlines in 1987. In 2001, Air Canada took over the aviation entities that Pacific Western Airlines had created.

Predecessor air carrier Central British Columbia Airlines was started by pilots Russ Baker and Walter Gilbert with financing supplied by Karl John Springer. Springer was a successful prospector, familiar with the importance of air transportation to prospecting and mine development. The company was based in Prince George and Fort St. James, British Columbia. At incorporation July 8, 1945, Frank Cooke and Lawrence Dickinson were recorded as President and Secretary-Treasurer as the pilots continued with Canadian Pacific Air Lines before CBCA went into operation. Baker&#x27;s wife Madge paid the lawyer&#x27;s fees for incorporation. After Baker had secured a contract with BC Forest Service to patrol for forest fires, Springer advanced $150,000 at 6% interest, secured by aircraft and other CBCA property.

Pilots provided air service to remote mining camps and logging operations in the North, delivering men and materials to isolated destinations.
It was in 1949 that Central B.C. Airways was commissioned to do aerial surveys for the giant aluminium and power complexes at Kitimat and Kemano in the rugged mountainous backcountry of British Columbia. During the development of this project, Central B.C. Airways handled 95% of the air support, consisting mainly of heavy industrial freight and workers.

Between 1949 and 1952, the company acquired seven other smaller flying services. With each acquisition, the company expanded its base of operations, providing the much needed manpower and equipment necessary to maintain a rapidly expanding air service. These companies included Associated Air Taxi, Associated Airways, Kamloops Air Service, Skeena Air Transport, Whitehorse Flying Services and Port Alberni Airways.

===1950s to 1970s===
In 1953, the company adopted the name Pacific Western Airlines. Additional companies were acquired, such as Queen Charlotte Airlines in 1955, giving the company a foothold in scheduled services, and Associated Airways in 1955, leading to a vital contract in the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line in Canada&#x27;s north.

In 1958, Russ Baker died.

A year later, in 1959, Pacific Western was part of the largest single transfer of scheduled services in Canadian aviation history. In that year, Canadian Pacific Air Lines released licensed routes from Edmonton to 18 points in Northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories. With this transfer, in addition to its existing routes, Pacific Western was licensed to provide scheduled air services over approximately 7,000 miles throughout Western and Northern Canada.

At this point in time, the company acquired a reputation for innovation and aggressiveness by developing several unique services for freight customers and passengers.

The Calgary-Edmonton &quot;Chieftain Airbus&quot; shuttle service was inaugurated in 1963, with passengers carrying their luggage to the aircraft and depositing it on the ramp for loading. A ticket agent on board a 66-seat Douglas DC-4 propliner would then collect the fare during the 55-minute flight. The airline operated the service from the close-in Edmonton City Centre Airport (YXD, formerly Edmonton Industrial Airport).

When the &quot;Chieftain Airbus&quot; service first started, it was estimated that it would take ten years to move one million passengers. That goal was reached in less than eight years.

1964 marked the introduction of another unique service known as Inclusive Tour Charter programs. This was another first for Canada, with excursion flights from Vancouver to Grand Cayman Islands. Later in the same year, Pacific Western pioneered group charters across the Atlantic, mainly to the United Kingdom.

In 1966, in anticipation of a regional air policy for Canada, Pacific Western began placing orders for jet and turboprop equipment. The regional policy became a reality in 1968, and the company was able to add many more ports of call to the already long list of destinations in Western Canada. Services at this point stretched from the U.S.Pacific Northwest to the Arctic Archipelago.

Boeing 707 equipment was added to the fleet in 1967, and Inclusive Tour programs were introduced to Mexico and Hawaii in the winter, with several European destinations served during the summer, all on a charter basis. The addition of a cargo model Boeing 707 meant that livestock and perishables could now be carried all over the world, and the name Pacific Western became synonymous with &quot;World Air Cargo&quot;. The company aircraft visited more than 90 countries during this period of time.

Pacific Western operated a worldwide Boeing 707 cargo and passenger charter program until the last aircraft was sold in 1979.

In 1967, Pacific Western became the first commercial operator of the Lockheed L-100 Hercules turboprop freighter. The Hercules were acquired to support Canada&#x27;s extensive search for energy and minerals in Northern Canada. Then, following the Spring ice break-up, the Hercules would rejoin the main cargo fleet in worldwide operations. Diverse cargoes included 21,000 kilos of dimes, 20,000 kilos of Christmas cake, and a shipment of electronic equipment to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the first commercial air shipment to that country.

In November 1968, the company introduced jet service on its scheduled route system with the delivery of its first Boeing 737-200 jetliner. Pacific Western was the first Canadian carrier to order the 737. The &quot;Stampeder Service&quot; linking Alberta and B.C. began on December 17, 1968.

Another transfer of licensing authority from CP Air (formerly Canadian Pacific Air Lines) to Pacific Western provided the company with routes throughout the Interior of B.C. in 1969. The acquisition and control of B.C. Air Lines in September 1970 enabled the company to supply expanded air service to routes in the B.C. Interior and on the coast. PWA then began operating small Nord 262 turboprop aircraft that had been previously flown by B.C. Air Lines.

With larger equipment such as the Douglas DC-4, Douglas DC-6, Convair 640, Lockheed L-188 Electra, Boeing 727-100C and Boeing 737-200, Pacific Western provided scheduled air service throughout B.C., Alberta and the Northwest Territories. By 1969, the &quot;Chieftain Airbus&quot; shuttle service between Calgary and Edmonton was being flown with Boeing 737-200 jets, Convair 640 turboprops and Douglas DC-6 propliners.

As the 1970s progressed, the airline&#x27;s equipment varied and the company began a fleet rationalization program, concentrating on the 117-seat Boeing 737-200 as the backbone of the mainline fleet. During the mid 1970s, Pacific Western was operating Boeing 727-100C jetliners in addition to its Boeing 737-200 and -200C aircraft. By the late 1970s, the company operated an all-jet mainline fleet.

===Government of Alberta ownership===
In 1974, the Government of Alberta under Progressive Conservative Premier Peter Lougheed assumed ownership of Pacific Western Airlines to assure the development of the North and Western Canada. The province purchased the airline for $37.5 million () during a secret takeover bid. The Alberta government moved quickly out of worries British Columbia Premier Dave Barrett had a similar plan. 

Following the acquisition, PWA&#x27;s headquarters moved from Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, British Columbia, moved to Calgary, Alberta. Calgary International Airport became the airline&#x27;s new hub. 

In 1983 the Peter Lougheed government sold the airline for $37.7 million () after promising to do so during the 1982 Alberta general election.

In 1976, Pacific Western was continuing to operate its &quot;Chieftain Airbus&quot; shuttle service between Calgary (YYC) and the Edmonton City Centre Airport (YXD, formerly the Edmonton Industrial Airport) with up to fourteen round trip flights a day operated with Boeing 737-200 jetliners.

In 1978, the company acquired the regional carrier Transair Ltd. of Winnipeg which included that airline&#x27;s Boeing 737-200 jets. In February 1979, in an agreement with the Canadian Transport Commission, Transair ceased all scheduled operations east of Winnipeg and Calgary/Edmonton via Regina and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. This linked the Pacific Western/Transair systems, completing the first step to eventual merger. On December 1, 1979, all operating licences and routes were transferred to Pacific Western Airlines and Transair ceased as a regional carrier.

Like Pacific Western, Transair comprised several companies. Its history dated back to 1947 with the founding of Central Northern Airways. In 1956, Central Northern Airways and Arctic Wings merged under the name Transair. The most significant of various amalgamations during the years took place in 1969 when Transair and Midwest Airlines combined their operations to form a diversified regional carrier serving midwest prairie Canada to Toronto and the Arctic with the Transair fleet including Boeing 737-200 and Fokker F28 Fellowship jets for scheduled services and the Boeing 707 for charter flights.

===1985 Labour disputes===
On November 20, 1985, labour disputes began between the International Union, the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, the International Association of Machinists and the Canadian Air Line Flight Attendants&#x27; Association against Pacific Western. Between 90 and 125 picketers paraded for two hours through the terminal in December.

The unions appealed from the judgment of the honourable Mr. Justice Dixon on December 24, 1985, in which he granted an interim injunction restraining from various picketing activities and limiting the number of pickets permitted at one time at various locations.

Dixon, J. gave oral reasons for judgment stating that, despite the stated purpose of the picketing, improper and lawful activities had occurred during the course of it. He said:

&quot;I am persuaded on the evidence before me that the interest of the travelling public and the business interest of the applicant have been compromised by the picketing activities of the respondents and that such activities have exceeded the bounds of that which is proper and lawful, such that limited picketing only is to be permitted.&quot;

The labour dispute lasted until April 1986.

===1980s and merger===
By 1986 Pacific Western was the largest airline in Western Canada, carrying over 3 million passengers per year. In 1986, joint marketing agreements were signed with local service carriers: Calm Air of Thompson, Manitoba and Time Air of Lethbridge, Alberta, under the Pacific Western Spirit Program. Pacific Western employed nearly 3,000 people throughout Western Canada and Ontario.

Organizational changes in 1986 established a formal structural relationship between the holding company, Pacific Western Airlines Corporation, and the airline operating company, Pacific Western Airlines Ltd.

On December 2, 1986, PWA Corporation announced its intention to purchase Canadian Pacific Air Lines for $300 million, effective February 1, 1987.

The airline went through several iterations, originally consisting of small float planes in the 1950s, evolving to include a varied fleet of Convair 640 turboprops and Douglas propliners including DC-3, DC-4, DC-6 and DC-7C into the 1960s. PWA had a major impact in the Arctic and was instrumental in providing service to many isolated communities. The airline also operated several Boeing 707 aircraft that served in both a passenger and cargo capacity for charter work. Along with a number of Lockheed L-100 (the civilian version of the C-130 Hercules), PWA became a major player in the world air cargo business (also used extensively too support oil exploration in the High Arctic). The airline expanded to include a variety of aircraft, including Boeing 727-100s, Boeing 737-200s and two Boeing 767-200 aircraft. The airline was briefly owned by the Alberta provincial government in the mid 1970s. According to the July 1, 1983, edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), the airline was operating its Boeing 767 aircraft on scheduled services into Vancouver, Calgary, Regina and Winnipeg. By early 1985, the OAG listed 767 service being flown on a weekday roundtrip routing of Seattle (SEA) - Vancouver (YVR) - Calgary (YYC) - Saskatoon (YXE) - Winnipeg (YWG). The 767s were the largest aircraft ever operated in scheduled passenger service by PWA. However, they were then removed from the fleet in favor of the smaller Boeing 737.

Following the removal of the Boeing 767 aircraft during the mid 1980s, the fleet then exclusively consisted of Boeing 737-200 and 737-200C jetliners. Pacific Western had become one of the most innovative airlines on the west coast of Canada, servicing communities throughout western Canada and across the country.

In 1987, PWA Corp, the parent corporation of Pacific Western Airlines, purchased Canadian Pacific Air Lines (which formerly operated as CP Air but had changed its name back to Canadian Pacific) to form Canadian Airlines International. Wardair, another Canadian airline, was later purchased by PWA in 1989, resulting in only two major airlines in Canada: Canadian Airlines International and Air Canada. PWA and later Canadian airlines were based in Calgary. In December 1999, Air Canada took over Canadian Airlines International.

<text>Libinia emarginata, the portly spider crab, common spider crab or nine-spined spider crab, is a species of stenohaline crab that lives on the Atlantic coast of North America.

==Distribution==
&quot;Libinia emarginata&quot; occurs from Nova Scotia to the Florida Keys and through the Gulf of Mexico. It lives at depths of up to , with exceptional records of up to .

==Description==
&quot;Libinia emarginata&quot; is roughly triangular in outline and very heavily calcified, with a carapace about long and a leg span of . The whole crab is khaki, and the carapace is covered in spines and tubercles, and, as with other decorator crabs, often clothes itself in debris and small invertebrates.

===Reproduction===

Mating takes place, and eggs are produced from June to September. The eggs are initially a bright orange-red, but turn brown during development, which takes around 25 days. The eggs then hatch as zoea larvae, and the female can produce another brood of eggs within 12 hours, unlike many other crab species whose females only mate immediately after molting.

==Similar species==
&quot;Libinia emarginata&quot; is very similar to &quot;Libinia dubia&quot; with which it is largely sympatric. They can be told apart by examining the row of spines along the center of the carapace: in &quot;L. emarginata&quot; there are nine, while in &quot;L. dubia&quot; there are only six. Also, the rostrum of &quot;L. dubia&quot; is more deeply forked than that of &quot;L. emarginata&quot;.

==Ecology and behavior==
&quot;Libinia emarginata&quot; lives on various substrates, at depths of up to . Adults are sluggish and not aggressive, and younger crabs are frequently covered with sponges and hydroids.

Despite its small size, in comparison to other predatory crabs, &quot;L. emarginata&quot; feeds on large starfish such as &quot;Asterias forbesi&quot;.

Unusually for crabs, &quot;L. emarginata&quot; preferentially walks forwards, rather than sideways, although they are also capable of sidelong movement. Its skeletal, muscular and neural anatomy more closely resembles that of forward-walking species, rather than that of more closely related sideways-walking species.

&quot;L. emarginata&quot; will mate in large aggregations. These aggregations may function as a protective mechanism during reproduction. Males of &quot;L. emarginata&quot; show an unusual &quot;obstetrical behavior&quot;, in which gravid females who are about to release their larvae are held behind the male and aggressively protected.

<doc id="651910" wikidata="Q1740597" url="?curid=651910" title="Khartoum Resolution">
<text>The Khartoum Resolution () of 1 September 1967 was issued at the conclusion of the 1967 Arab League summit, which was convened in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, in the wake of the Six-Day War. The resolution is famous for containing (in the third paragraph) what became known as the &quot;Three Noes&quot; () or &quot;The Three Noes of Khartoum&quot; ().

== Resolution text ==
#The conference has affirmed the unity of Arab states, the unity of joint action and the need for coordination and for the elimination of all differences. The Kings, Presidents and representatives of the other Arab Heads of State at the conference have affirmed their countries&#x27; stand by an implementation of the Arab Solidarity Charter which was signed at the third Arab summit conference in Casablanca.
#The conference has agreed on the need to consolidate all efforts to eliminate the effects of the aggression on the basis that the occupied lands are Arab lands and that the burden of regaining these lands falls on all the Arab States.
#The Arab Heads of State have agreed to unite their political efforts at the international and diplomatic level to eliminate the effects of the aggression and to ensure the withdrawal of the aggressive Israeli forces from the Arab lands which have been occupied since the aggression of 5 June. This will be done within the framework of the main principles by which the Arab States abide, namely, no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it, and insistence on the rights of the Palestinian people in their own country.
#The conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil recommended that suspension of oil pumping be used as a weapon in the battle. However, after thoroughly studying the matter, the summit conference has come to the conclusion that the oil pumping can itself be used as a positive weapon, since oil is an Arab resource which can be used to strengthen the economy of the Arab States directly affected by the aggression, so that these States will be able to stand firm in the battle. The conference has, therefore, decided to resume the pumping of oil, since oil is a positive Arab resource that can be used in the service of Arab goals. It can contribute to the efforts to enable those Arab States which were exposed to the aggression and thereby lost economic resources to stand firm and eliminate the effects of the aggression. The oil-producing States have, in fact, participated in the efforts to enable the States affected by the aggression to stand firm in the face of any economic pressure.
#The participants in the conference have approved the plan proposed by Kuwait to set up an Arab Economic and Social Development Fund on the basis of the recommendation of the Baghdad conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil.
#The participants have agreed on the need to adopt the necessary measures to strengthen military preparation to face all eventualities.
#The conference has decided to expedite the elimination of foreign bases in the Arab States.

==Interpretations==
Commentators have frequently presented the resolution as an example of Arab rejectionism. 
Abd al Azim Ramadan stated that the Khartoum decisions left only one option—war. Efraim Halevy, Guy Ben-Porat, Steven R. David, Julius Stone, and Ian Bremmer all agree the Khartoum Resolution amounted to a rejection of Israel&#x27;s right to exist. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) itself enlisted the Khartoum Resolution to advocate against acceptance of Israel&#x27;s right to exist as articulated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. Benny Morris wrote that the Arab leaders &quot;hammered out a defiant, rejectionist platform that was to bedevil all peace moves in the region for a decade&quot; despite an Israeli offer on 19 June 1967 &quot;to give up Sinai and the Golan in exchange for peace.&quot; Odd Bull of the UNTSO opined in much the same manner in 1976.

Avi Shlaim has argued that Arab spokesmen interpreted the Khartoum declarations to mean &quot;no formal peace &quot;treaty&quot;, but not a rejection of peace; no &quot;direct&quot; negotiations, but not a refusal to talk through third parties; and no &quot;de jure&quot; recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state&quot; (emphasis in original). Shlaim states that the conference marked a turning point in Arab–Israeli relations by noting that Gamal Abdel Nasser urged Hussein of Jordan to seek a &quot;comprehensive settlement&quot; with Israel. Shlaim acknowledges that none of that was known in Israel at the time, whose leaders took the &quot;Three Nos&quot; at face value. Fred Khouri argued that &quot;the Khartoum conference cleared the way for the Arab moderates to seek a political solution and to offer, in exchange for their conquered lands, important concessions short of actually recognizing Israel and negotiating formal peace treaties with her.&quot;

In the event, indirect negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Egypt eventually opened through the auspices of the Jarring Mission (1967–1973), and secret direct talks also took place between Israel and Jordan, but neither avenue succeeded in achieving a meaningful settlement, which set the stage for a new round of conflict.

<text>Brian Louis Allen Sutter (born October 7, 1956) is a Canadian former ice hockey forward and former head coach in the National Hockey League (NHL). Brian is the second oldest of the famous Sutter brothers and the oldest of the six that played in the NHL. He is also the only one to have his number retired by an NHL team.

==Career==

===Player===
Sutter was drafted by the St. Louis Blues during the 2nd round (20th overall) in the 1976 NHL Entry Draft. He played for the Blues until 1988, when a nagging back injury forced him into retirement. In 12 years with the Blues, he played in three NHL All-Star Games – 1982, 1983, and 1985. For the last nine years of his career, he was the Blues&#x27; captain. His jersey, #11, was retired by the St. Louis Blues on December 30, 1988.

===Coaching===
Immediately after retiring, he was named the Blues&#x27; head coach (1988–1992). In 1991, he won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL&#x27;s best coach. All told, he spent the first 16 years of his adult life at ice level with the Blues.

Sutter subsequently held head coaching positions with the Boston Bruins, Calgary Flames, and Chicago Blackhawks (2001–2004). On June 21, 2005, the Blackhawks hired Dale Tallon as their new general manager; Tallon and the rebuilding Blackhawks decided not to renew Sutter&#x27;s contract.

During the 2006–07 season, Sutter coached the Bentley Generals of the Chinook Hockey League, leading the team to its first berth in the Allan Cup, Canada&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s hockey championship.

Sutter was named the head coach of the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Red Deer Rebels on July 12, 2007, replacing his younger brother Brent, who left the Rebels to become the head coach of the NHL&#x27;s New Jersey Devils. On March 24, 2008, the Rebels announced that Brian Sutter had resigned as head coach of the team, citing personal reasons.

Sutter returned as head coach of the Generals for the 2008–09 season, leading them to its first Allan Cup title in 2009. In August 2012, Sutter left the Generals to become the new head coach of the Innisfail Eagles, also of the Chinook Hockey League. He stepped down as head coach of Innisfail in 2022.

==Personal life==
Sutter and his wife Judy have two children, a son Shaun and a daughter, Abigail.

<doc id="651913" wikidata="Q13632551" url="?curid=651913" title="Co-curricular activity (Singapore)">
<text>In Singapore, a co-curricular activity (CCA), is a non-academic activity that all students must undertake as part of their education. Introduced by the Ministry of Education (MOE), CCAs are strongly encouraged at the primary and post-secondary level but compulsory at secondary level. Students can choose from 4 categories: clubs and societies, physical sports, uniformed groups, and visual and performing arts. They may also start their own activities with the school’s approval. Anyone offering enrichment activities to schools must be registered with the MOE. 

==Structure==
CCA choices vary widely from school to school, although schools at each education level are required to conform to national standards prescribed for that level. Joining a CCA is strongly encouraged in the primary and post-secondary education level. However, in secondary schools, CCAs are treated more seriously. Students are required to pick at least one Core CCA to join in Secondary One, while being able to choose a second CCA if they wish. If the student excels and achieves results in their CCA, 1 to 2 &#x27;O&#x27; Level points are removed from the examination aggregate (a lower aggregate indicates better marks) at the end of the fourth/fifth year.

The activities available as CCA choices can be divided into 4 key categories:

* Clubs &amp; Societies
* Physical Sports
* Uniformed Groups
* Visual &amp; Performing Arts

== Competitions ==
Many CCA-related competitions are held in Singapore, creating a competitive environment which provide CCA groups an objective to work towards.

The Ministry of Education organises competitions for competitive sports at the zonal and national level, respectively the yearly Zonal and National Schools Competitions. MOE also organises the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) for the Aesthetics CCAs.

==List of CCAs==

It contains the city of Spokane (the second largest city in the state), the Tri-Cities, the Columbia River and the Grand Coulee Dam, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the fertile farmlands of the Yakima Valley and the Palouse. Unlike in Western Washington, the climate is dry, including some desert environments.

===Counties===
Eastern Washington is composed of Adams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Garfield, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman, and Yakima counties. Some definitions also include part of Skamania County that lies east of the ridge line of the Cascade Mountains.

==Climate==

A significant difference between Eastern Washington and the western half of the state is its climate. While the west half of the state is located in a rainy oceanic climate, the eastern half receives little rainfall due to the rainshadow created by the Cascade Mountains. Also, due to being farther from the sea, the east side has both hotter summers and colder winters than the west. Most communities in Eastern Washington, for example, have significant yearly snowfall, while in the west snowfall is minimal and not seen every year. The east and west do still have some climatic traits in common, though: more rainfall in winter than summer, a lack of severe storms, and milder temperature ranges than more inland locations.

There is some variation in both temperature and rainfall throughout Eastern Washington. Generally, lower elevations are both hotter and drier than higher elevations. This is easily seen in the comparison between low-elevation Richland with higher elevation Spokane.

==Population==
Compared to Western Washington, Eastern Washington has roughly twice the land area and one-fourth the population. As of the 2020 census, Eastern Washington was home to 1,667,593 of the state&#x27;s total 7,705,281 residents, making its population comparable to that of West Virginia. The population growth rate between the two is roughly the same. Of Washington&#x27;s ten Congressional districts, Eastern Washington exactly encompasses two (the 4th and 5th), aside from a small portion of the 8th in Chelan, Douglas, and Kittitas Counties.

==Education==

Eastern Washington hosts a number of universities including three of the state&#x27;s five public universities.

===Public institutions===
*Central Washington University
*Eastern Washington University
*Washington State University
*A number of local community colleges including:
**Big Bend Community College
**Columbia Basin College
**Spokane Community College
**Spokane Falls Community College
**Walla Walla Community College
**Wenatchee Valley College
**Yakima Valley College

===Private institutions===
*Gonzaga University
*Heritage University
*Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences
*Walla Walla University
*Whitman College
*Whitworth University

===Research institutions===
*Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
*Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute at Central Washington University

==Proposed statehood==

There have been sporadic movements to create a 51st state out of Eastern Washington by splitting the current state down the Cascades, but proposals have rarely progressed out of the state legislature&#x27;s committees. Bills in the Washington State Legislature which would have requested the United States Congress to take up the question were proposed in 1996, 1999, 2005, and 2017. Proposed names for the new state have included Lincoln, Columbia, Liberty, or simply &quot;Eastern Washington&quot;. Many of these proposals would include the Idaho Panhandle as part of the proposed state of Lincoln.

Eastern Washington tends to vote Republican, whereas Western Washington usually votes Democratic. However, Spokane, the proposed capital and largest city, tends to have a higher democratic vote than other Eastern Washington cities. Additionally, Whitman County votes Democratic.

<text>Sauropoda (), whose members are known as sauropods (; from &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, &#x27;lizard-footed&#x27;), is a clade of saurischian (&#x27;lizard-hipped&#x27;) dinosaurs. Sauropods had very long necks, long tails, small heads (relative to the rest of their body), and four thick, pillar-like legs. They are notable for the enormous sizes attained by some species, and the group includes the largest animals to have ever lived on land. Well-known genera include &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;,
&quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus,&quot; and &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot;.

The oldest known unequivocal sauropod dinosaurs are known from the Early Jurassic. &quot;Isanosaurus&quot; and &quot;Antetonitrus&quot; were originally described as Triassic sauropods, but their age, and in the case of &quot;Antetonitrus&quot; also its sauropod status, were subsequently questioned. Sauropod-like sauropodomorph tracks from the Fleming Fjord Formation (Greenland) might, however, indicate the occurrence of the group in the Late Triassic. By the Late Jurassic (150 million years ago), sauropods had become widespread (especially the diplodocids and brachiosaurids). By the Late Cretaceous, one group of sauropods, the titanosaurs, had replaced all others and had a near-global distribution. However, as with all other non-avian dinosaurs alive at the time, the titanosaurs died out in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Fossilised remains of sauropods have been found on every continent, including Antarctica.

The name Sauropoda was coined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878, and is derived from Ancient Greek, meaning &quot;lizard foot&quot;. Sauropods are one of the most recognizable groups of dinosaurs, and have become a fixture in popular culture due to their impressive size.

Complete sauropod fossil finds are extremely rare. Many species, especially the largest, are known only from isolated and disarticulated bones. Many near-complete specimens lack heads, tail tips and limbs.

==Description==
Sauropods were herbivorous (plant-eating), usually quite long-necked quadrupeds (four-legged), often with spatulate (spatula-shaped: broad at the tip, narrow at the neck) teeth. They had tiny heads, massive bodies, and most had long tails. Their hind legs were thick, straight, and powerful, ending in club-like feet with five toes, though only the inner three (or in some cases four) bore claws. Their forelimbs were rather more slender and typically ended in pillar-like hands built for supporting weight; often only the thumb bore a claw. Many illustrations of sauropods in the flesh miss these facts, inaccurately depicting sauropods with hooves capping the claw-less digits of the feet, or more than three claws or hooves on the hands. The proximal caudal vertebrae are extremely diagnostic for sauropods.

===Size===

The sauropods&#x27; most defining characteristic was their size. Even the dwarf sauropods (perhaps 5 to 6 metres, or 20 feet long) were counted among the largest animals in their ecosystem. Their only real competitors in terms of size are the rorquals, such as the blue whale. But, unlike whales, sauropods were primarily terrestrial animals.

Their body structure did not vary as much as other dinosaurs, perhaps due to size constraints, but they displayed ample variety. Some, like the diplodocids, possessed tremendously long tails, which they may have been able to crack like a whip as a signal or to deter or injure predators, or to make sonic booms. &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, at long, was the longest sauropod known from reasonably complete remains, but others, like the old record holder, &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, were also extremely long. The holotype (and now lost) vertebra of &quot;Amphicoelias fragillimus&quot; (now &quot;Maraapunisaurus&quot;) may have come from an animal long; its vertebral column would have been substantially longer than that of the blue whale. However, research published in 2015 speculated that the size estimates of &quot;A. fragillimus&quot; may have been highly exaggerated. The longest dinosaur known from reasonable fossils material is probably &quot;Argentinosaurus huinculensis&quot; with length estimates of to according to the most recent researches. However the giant &quot;Barosaurus&quot; specimen BYU 9024 might have been even larger reaching lengths of 45–48 meters (148–157 ft).

The longest terrestrial animal alive today, the African elephant, can only reach lengths of .

Others, like the brachiosaurids, were extremely tall, with high shoulders and extremely long necks. The tallest sauropod was the giant &quot;Barosaurus&quot; specimen at tall. By comparison, the giraffe, the tallest of all living land animals, is only 4.8 to 5.6 metres (15.74 to 18.3 ft) tall.

The best evidence indicates that the most massive were &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; (65–80 metric tons), &quot;Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum&quot; (60-80 metric tons), the giant &quot;Barosaurus&quot; specimen (60-80+ metric tons) and &quot;Patagotitan&quot; with &quot;Puertasaurus&quot; (50-55 metric tons). Meanwhile, &#x27;mega-sauropods&#x27; such as &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; has long been scrutinized due to controversial debates on its validity, but recent photos re-surfacing in 2022 have legitimized it, allowing for more updated estimates that range between 110–170 tons, rivaling the blue whale in size. The weight of &quot;Amphicoelias fragillimus&quot; was estimated at 122.4 metric tons with lengths of up to nearly 60 meters but 2015 research argued that these estimates were based on a diplodocid rather than the more modern rebbachisaurid, suggesting a much shorter length of 35–40 meters with mass between 80–120 tons. Additional finds indicate a number of species likely reached or exceeded weights of 40 tons. The largest land animal alive today, the bush elephant, weighs no more than .

Among the smallest sauropods were the primitive &quot;Ohmdenosaurus&quot; (4 m, or 13 ft long), the dwarf titanosaur &quot;Magyarosaurus&quot; (6 m or 20 ft long), and the dwarf brachiosaurid &quot;Europasaurus&quot;, which was 6.2 meters long as a fully-grown adult. Its small stature was probably the result of insular dwarfism occurring in a population of sauropods isolated on an island of the late Jurassic in what is now the Langenberg area of northern Germany. The diplodocoid sauropod &quot;Brachytrachelopan&quot; was the shortest member of its group because of its unusually short neck. Unlike other sauropods, whose necks could grow to up to four times the length of their backs, the neck of &quot;Brachytrachelopan&quot; was shorter than its backbone.

Fossils from perhaps the largest dinosaur ever found were discovered in 2012 in the Neuquén Province of northwest Patagonia, Argentina. It is believed that they are from a titanosaur, which were amongst the largest sauropods.

On or shortly before 29 March 2017 a sauropod footprint about 5.6 feet (1.7 meters) long was found at Walmadany in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia. The report said that it was the biggest known yet. In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi estimated the size of the animal at 31 meters (102 ft) and 72 tonnes (79.4 short tons) based on the 1.75 meter (5.7 ft) long footprint.

===Limbs and feet===
As massive quadrupeds, sauropods developed specialized &quot;graviportal&quot; (weight-bearing) limbs. The hind feet were broad, and retained three claws in most species. Particularly unusual compared with other animals were the highly modified front feet (&quot;manus&quot;). The front feet of sauropods were very dissimilar from those of modern large quadrupeds, such as elephants. Rather than splaying out to the sides to create a wide foot as in elephants, the manus bones of sauropods were arranged in fully vertical columns, with extremely reduced finger bones (though it is not clear if the most primitive sauropods, such as &quot;Vulcanodon&quot; and &quot;Barapasaurus&quot;, had such forefeet). The front feet were so modified in eusauropods that individual digits would not have been visible in life.

The arrangement of the forefoot bone (&quot;metacarpal&quot;) columns in eusauropods was semi-circular, so sauropod forefoot prints are horseshoe-shaped. Unlike elephants, print evidence shows that sauropods lacked any fleshy padding to back the front feet, making them concave. The only claw visible in most sauropods was the distinctive thumb claw (associated with digit I). Almost all sauropods had such a claw, though what purpose it served is unknown. The claw was largest (as well as tall and laterally flattened) in diplodocids, and very small in brachiosaurids, some of which seem to have lost the claw entirely based on trackway evidence. Titanosaurs may have lost the thumb claw completely (with the exception of early forms, such as &quot;Janenschia&quot;).

Titanosaurs were most unusual among sauropods, as, across their history as a clade, they lost not just the external claw but also completely lost the digits of the front foot. Advanced titanosaurs had no digits or digit bones, and walked only on horseshoe-shaped &quot;stumps&quot; made up of the columnar metacarpal bones.

Print evidence from Portugal shows that, in at least some sauropods (probably brachiosaurids), the bottom and sides of the forefoot column was likely covered in small, spiny scales, which left score marks in the prints. In titanosaurs, the ends of the metacarpal bones that contacted the ground were unusually broad and squared-off, and some specimens preserve the remains of soft tissue covering this area, suggesting that the front feet were rimmed with some kind of padding in these species.

Matthew Bonnan has shown that sauropod dinosaur long bones grew isometrically: that is, there was little to no change in shape as juvenile sauropods became gigantic adults. Bonnan suggested that this odd scaling pattern (most vertebrates show significant shape changes in long bones associated with increasing weight support) might be related to a stilt-walker principle (suggested by amateur scientist Jim Schmidt) in which the long legs of adult sauropods allowed them to easily cover great distances without changing their overall mechanics.

===Air sacs===
Along with other saurischian dinosaurs (such as theropods, including birds), sauropods had a system of air sacs, evidenced by indentations and hollow cavities in most of their vertebrae that had been invaded by them. Pneumatic, hollow bones are a characteristic feature of all sauropods. These air spaces reduced the overall weight of the massive necks that the sauropods had, and the air-sac system in general, allowing for a single-direction airflow through stiff lungs, made it possible for the sauropods to get enough oxygen. This adaptation would have advantaged sauropods particularly in the relatively low oxygen conditions of the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.

The bird-like hollowing of sauropod bones was recognized early in the study of these animals, and, in fact, at least one sauropod specimen found in the 19th century (&quot;Ornithopsis&quot;) was originally misidentified as a pterosaur (a flying reptile) because of this.
===Armor===

Some sauropods had armor. There were genera with small clubs on their tails, a prominent example being &quot;Shunosaurus&quot;, and several titanosaurs, such as &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; and &quot;Ampelosaurus&quot;, had small bony osteoderms covering portions of their bodies.

===Teeth===

A study by Michael D&#x27;Emic and his colleagues from Stony Brook University found that sauropods evolved high tooth replacement rates to keep up with their large appetites. The study suggested that &quot;Nigersaurus&quot;, for example, replaced each tooth every 14 days, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; replaced each tooth every 62 days, and &quot;Diplodocus&quot; replaced each tooth once every 35 days. The scientists found qualities of the tooth affected how long it took for a new tooth to grow. &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;&#x27;s teeth took longer to grow than those for &quot;Diplodocus&quot; because they were larger.
It was also noted by D&#x27;Emic and his team that the differences between the teeth of the sauropods also indicated a difference in diet. &quot;Diplodocus&quot; ate plants low to the ground and &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; browsed leaves from top and middle branches. According to the scientists, the specializing of their diets helped the different herbivorous dinosaurs to coexist.

===Necks===

Sauropod necks have been found at over in length, a full six times longer than the world record giraffe neck. Enabling this were a number of essential physiological features. The dinosaurs&#x27; overall large body size and quadrupedal stance provided a stable base to support the neck, and the head was evolved to be very small and light, losing the ability to orally process food. By reducing their heads to simple harvesting tools that got the plants into the body, the sauropods needed less power to lift their heads, and thus were able to develop necks with less dense muscle and connective tissue. This drastically reduced the overall mass of the neck, enabling further elongation.

Sauropods also had a great number of adaptations in their skeletal structure. Some sauropods had as many as 19 cervical vertebrae, whereas almost all mammals are limited to only seven. Additionally, each vertebra was extremely long and had a number of empty spaces in them which would have been filled only with air. An air-sac system connected to the spaces not only lightened the long necks, but effectively increased the airflow through the trachea, helping the creatures to breathe in enough air. By evolving vertebrae consisting of 60% air, the sauropods were able to minimize the amount of dense, heavy bone without sacrificing the ability to take sufficiently large breaths to fuel the entire body with oxygen. According to Kent Stevens, computer-modeled reconstructions of the skeletons made from the vertebrae indicate that sauropod necks were capable of sweeping out large feeding areas without needing to move their bodies, but were unable to be retracted to a position much above the shoulders for exploring the area or reaching higher.

Another proposed function of the sauropods&#x27; long necks was essentially a radiator to deal with the extreme amount of heat produced from their large body mass. Considering that the metabolism would have been doing an immense amount of work, it would certainly have generated a large amount of heat as well, and elimination of this excess heat would have been essential for survival.
It has also been proposed that the long necks would have cooled the veins and arteries going to the brain, avoiding excessively heated blood from reaching the head. It was in fact found that the increase in metabolic rate resulting from the sauropods&#x27; necks was slightly more than compensated for by the extra surface area from which heat could dissipate.

==Palaeobiology==

===Ecology===

Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) performed on a titanosauriform sauropod from the Turonian-aged Tamagawa Formation suggests that the sauropod fed on plant material that was softer than insect exoskeletons or mollusc shells, with the diet likely consisting of ferns and gymnosperms. The DMTA results also suggested that sauropods likely masticated more energetically than present-day lepidosaurs do.

When sauropods were first discovered, their immense size led many scientists to compare them with modern-day whales. Most studies in the 19th and early 20th centuries concluded that sauropods were too large to have supported their weight on land, and therefore that they must have been mainly aquatic. Most life restorations of sauropods in art through the first three quarters of the 20th century depicted them fully or partially immersed in water. This early notion was cast in doubt beginning in the 1950s, when a study by Kermack (1951) demonstrated that, if the animal were submerged in several metres of water, the pressure would be enough to fatally collapse the lungs and airway. However, this and other early studies of sauropod ecology were flawed in that they ignored a substantial body of evidence that the bodies of sauropods were heavily permeated with air sacs. In 1878, paleontologist E.D. Cope had even referred to these structures as &quot;floats&quot;.

Beginning in the 1970s, the effects of sauropod air sacs on their supposed aquatic lifestyle began to be explored. Paleontologists such as Coombs and Bakker used this, as well as evidence from sedimentology and biomechanics, to show that sauropods were primarily terrestrial animals. In 2004, D.M. Henderson noted that, due to their extensive system of air sacs, sauropods would have been buoyant and would not have been able to submerge their torsos completely below the surface of the water; in other words, they would float, and would not have been in danger of lung collapse due to water pressure when swimming.

Evidence for swimming in sauropods comes from fossil trackways that have occasionally been found to preserve only the forefeet (manus) impressions. Henderson showed that such trackways can be explained by sauropods with long forelimbs (such as macronarians) floating in relatively shallow water deep enough to keep the shorter hind legs free of the bottom, and using the front limbs to punt forward. However, due to their body proportions, floating sauropods would also have been very unstable and maladapted for extended periods in the water. This mode of aquatic locomotion, combined with its instability, led Henderson to refer to sauropods in water as &quot;tipsy punters&quot;.

While sauropods could therefore not have been aquatic as historically depicted, there is evidence that they preferred wet and coastal habitats. Sauropod footprints are commonly found following coastlines or crossing floodplains, and sauropod fossils are often found in wet environments or intermingled with fossils of marine organisms. A good example of this would be the massive Jurassic sauropod trackways found in lagoon deposits on Scotland&#x27;s Isle of Skye. Studies published in 2021 suggest sauropods could not inhabit polar regions. This study suggests they were largely confined to tropical areas and had metabolisms that were very different to those of other dinosaurs, perhaps intermediate between mammals and reptiles. New studies published by Taia Wyenberg-henzler in 2022 suggest that sauropods in North America declined due to undetermined reasons in regards to their niches and distribution during the end of the Jurassic and into the latest Cretaceous. Why this is remains unclear, but some similarities in feeding niches between iguanodontians, hadrosauroids and sauropods have been suggested and may have resulted in some competition. However, this cannot fully explain the full decline in distribution of sauropods, as competitive exclusion would have resulted in a much more rapid decline than what is shown in the fossil record. Moreover, it must be determined as to whether sauropod declines in North America was the result of a change in preferred flora that sauropods ate, climate, or other factors. It is also suggested in this same study that iguanodontians and hadrosauroids took advantage of recently vacated niches left by a decline in sauropod diversity during the late Jurassic and the Cretaceous in North America.

===Herding and parental care===

Many lines of fossil evidence, from both bone beds and trackways, indicate that sauropods were gregarious animals that formed herds. However, the makeup of the herds varied between species. Some bone beds, for example a site from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina, appear to show herds made up of individuals of various age groups, mixing juveniles and adults. However, a number of other fossil sites and trackways indicate that many sauropod species travelled in herds segregated by age, with juveniles forming herds separate from adults. Such segregated herding strategies have been found in species such as &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, &quot;Bellusaurus&quot; and some diplodocids.

In a review of the evidence for various herd types, Myers and Fiorillo attempted to explain why sauropods appear to have often formed segregated herds. Studies of microscopic tooth wear show that juvenile sauropods had diets that differed from their adult counterparts, so herding together would not have been as productive as herding separately, where individual herd members could forage in a coordinated way. The vast size difference between juveniles and adults may also have played a part in the different feeding and herding strategies.

Since the segregation of juveniles and adults must have taken place soon after hatching, and combined with the fact that sauropod hatchlings were most likely precocial, Myers and Fiorillo concluded that species with age-segregated herds would not have exhibited much parental care. On the other hand, scientists who have studied age-mixed sauropod herds suggested that these species may have cared for their young for an extended period before reaching adulthood. A 2014 study suggested that the time from laying the egg to the time of the hatching was likely to have been between 65 and 82 days. Exactly how segregated versus age-mixed herding varied across different groups of sauropods is unknown. Further examples of gregarious behavior will need to be discovered from more sauropod species to detect possible distribution patterns.

Multiple nesting sites discovered in Argentina and India contain 30-400 clutches of fossilized eggs that were found preserved, providing evidence of sauropod maternal care. Researchers suggest that sauropods might have settled in nesting grounds close to volcanic activity for geothermal incubation, in which the mothers keep their eggs warm. This behavior is similar to modern birds and reptiles who follow the same method. 

===Rearing stance===

Since early in the history of their study, scientists, such as Osborn, have speculated that sauropods could rear up on their hind legs, using the tail as the third &#x27;leg&#x27; of a tripod. A skeletal mount depicting the diplodocid &quot;Barosaurus lentus&quot; rearing up on its hind legs at the American Museum of Natural History is one illustration of this hypothesis. In a 2005 paper, Rothschild and Molnar reasoned that if sauropods had adopted a bipedal posture at times, there would be evidence of stress fractures in the forelimb &#x27;hands&#x27;. However, none were found after they examined a large number of sauropod skeletons.

Heinrich Mallison (in 2009) was the first to study the physical potential for various sauropods to rear into a tripodal stance. Mallison found that some characters previously linked to rearing adaptations were actually unrelated (such as the wide-set hip bones of titanosaurs) or would have hindered rearing. For example, titanosaurs had an unusually flexible backbone, which would have decreased stability in a tripodal posture and would have put more strain on the muscles. Likewise, it is unlikely that brachiosaurids could rear up onto the hind legs, as their center of gravity was much farther forward than other sauropods, which would cause such a stance to be unstable.

Diplodocids, on the other hand, appear to have been well adapted for rearing up into a tripodal stance. Diplodocids had a center of mass directly over the hips, giving them greater balance on two legs. Diplodocids also had the most mobile necks of sauropods, a well-muscled pelvic girdle, and tail vertebrae with a specialised shape that would allow the tail to bear weight at the point it touched the ground. Mallison concluded that diplodocids were better adapted to rearing than elephants, which do so occasionally in the wild. He also argues that stress fractures in the wild do not occur from everyday behaviour, such as feeding-related activities (contra Rothschild and Molnar).

===Head and neck posture===
There is little agreement over how sauropods held their heads and necks, and the postures they could achieve in life.

Whether sauropods&#x27; long necks could be used for browsing high trees has been questioned based on calculations suggesting that just pumping blood up to the head in such a posture for long would have used some half of its energy intake. Further, to move blood to such a height—dismissing posited auxiliary hearts in the neck—would require a heart 15 times as large as of a similar-sized whale.

The above have been used to argue that the long neck must instead have been held more or less horizontally, presumed to enable feeding on plants over a wide area with less need to move about, yielding a large energy saving for such a large animal. Reconstructions of the necks of &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; have therefore often portrayed them in near-horizontal, so-called &quot;neutral, undeflected posture&quot;.

However, research on living animals demonstrates that almost all extant tetrapods hold the base of their necks sharply flexed when alert, showing that any inference from bones about habitual &quot;neutral postures&quot; is deeply unreliable. Meanwhile, computer modeling of ostrich necks has raised doubts over the flexibility needed for stationary grazing.

===Trackways and locomotion===

Sauropod trackways and other fossil footprints (known as &quot;ichnites&quot;) are known from abundant evidence present on most continents. Ichnites have helped support other biological hypotheses about sauropods, including general fore and hind foot anatomy (see &quot;Limbs and feet&quot; above). Generally, prints from the forefeet are much smaller than the hind feet, and often crescent-shaped. Occasionally ichnites preserve traces of the claws, and help confirm which sauropod groups lost claws or even digits on their forefeet.

Sauropod tracks from the Villar del Arzobispo Formation of early Berriasian age in Spain support the gregarious behaviour of the group. The tracks are possibly more similar to &quot;Sauropodichnus giganteus&quot; than any other ichnogenera, although they have been suggested to be from a basal titanosauriform. The tracks are wide-gauge, and the grouping as close to &quot;Sauropodichnus&quot; is also supported by the manus-to-pes distance, the morphology of the manus being kidney bean-shaped, and the morphology of the pes being subtriangular. It cannot be identified whether the footprints of the herd were caused by juveniles or adults, because of the lack of previous trackway individual age identification.
Generally, sauropod trackways are divided into three categories based on the distance between opposite limbs: narrow gauge, medium gauge, and wide gauge. The gauge of the trackway can help determine how wide-set the limbs of various sauropods were and how this may have impacted the way they walked. A 2004 study by Day and colleagues found that a general pattern could be found among groups of advanced sauropods, with each sauropod family being characterised by certain trackway gauges. They found that most sauropods other than titanosaurs had narrow-gauge limbs, with strong impressions of the large thumb claw on the forefeet. Medium gauge trackways with claw impressions on the forefeet probably belong to brachiosaurids and other primitive titanosauriformes, which were evolving wider-set limbs but retained their claws. Primitive true titanosaurs also retained their forefoot claw but had evolved fully wide gauge limbs. Wide gauge limbs were retained by advanced titanosaurs, trackways from which show a wide gauge and lack of any claws or digits on the forefeet.

Occasionally, only trackways from the forefeet are found. Falkingham &quot;et al.&quot; used computer modelling to show that this could be due to the properties of the substrate. These need to be just right to preserve tracks. Differences in hind limb and fore limb surface area, and therefore contact pressure with the substrate, may sometimes lead to only the forefeet trackways being preserved.

====Biomechanics and speed====

In a study published in PLoS ONE on October 30, 2013, by Bill Sellers, Rodolfo Coria, Lee Margetts &quot;et al.&quot;, &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; was digitally reconstructed to test its locomotion for the first time. Before the study, the most common way of estimating speed was through studying bone histology and ichnology. Commonly, studies about sauropod bone histology and speed focus on the postcranial skeleton, which holds many unique features, such as an enlarged process on the ulna, a wide lobe on the ilia, an inward-slanting top third of the femur, and an extremely ovoid femur shaft. Those features are useful when attempting to explain trackway patterns of graviportal animals. When studying ichnology to calculate sauropod speed, there are a few problems, such as only providing estimates for certain gaits because of preservation bias, and being subject to many more accuracy problems.

To estimate the gait and speed of &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;, the study performed a musculoskeletal analysis. The only previous musculoskeletal analyses were conducted on hominoids, terror birds, and other dinosaurs. Before they could conduct the analysis, the team had to create a digital skeleton of the animal in question, show where there would be muscle layering, locate the muscles and joints, and finally find the muscle properties before finding the gait and speed. The results of the biomechanics study revealed that &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; was mechanically competent at a top speed of 2 m/s (5 mph) given the great weight of the animal and the strain that its joints were capable of bearing. The results further revealed that much larger terrestrial vertebrates might be possible, but would require significant body remodeling and possible sufficient behavioral change to prevent joint collapse.

===Body size===

Sauropods were gigantic descendants of surprisingly small ancestors. Basal dinosauriformes, such as &quot;Pseudolagosuchus&quot; and &quot;Marasuchus&quot; from the Middle Triassic of Argentina, weighed approximately or less. These evolved into saurischia, which saw a rapid increase of bauplan size, although more primitive members like &quot;Eoraptor&quot;, &quot;Panphagia&quot;, &quot;Pantydraco&quot;, &quot;Saturnalia&quot; and &quot;Guaibasaurus&quot; still retained a moderate size, possibly under . Even with these small, primitive forms, there is a notable size increase among sauropodomorphs, although scanty remains of this period make interpretation conjectural. There is one definite example of a small derived sauropodomorph: &quot;Anchisaurus&quot;, under , even though it is closer to the sauropods than &quot;Plateosaurus&quot; and &quot;Riojasaurus&quot;, which were upwards of in weight.

Evolving from sauropodomorphs, the sauropods were huge. Their giant size probably resulted from an increased growth rate made possible by tachymetabolic endothermy, a trait which evolved in sauropodomorphs. Once branched into sauropods, sauropodomorphs continued steadily to grow larger, with smaller sauropods, like the Early Jurassic &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; and &quot;Kotasaurus&quot;, evolving into even larger forms like the Middle Jurassic &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; and &quot;Patagosaurus&quot;. Responding to the growth of sauropods, their theropod predators grew also, as shown by an &quot;Allosaurus&quot;-sized coelophysoid from Germany.

====Size in Neosauropoda====
Neosauropoda is quite plausibly the clade of dinosaurs with the largest body sizes ever to have existed. The few exceptions of smaller size are hypothesized to be caused by island dwarfism, or other ecological pressures, although there is a trend in some Titanosauria towards a smaller size. The titanosaurs, however, were some of the largest sauropods ever. Other than titanosaurs, diplodocoids also reached truly gigantic sizes. Meanwhile, a clade of diplodocoids, called Dicraeosauridae, are identified by a small to medium body size. No sauropods were very small, however, for even &quot;dwarf&quot; sauropods are larger than , a size reached by only about 10% of all mammalian species.

====Independent gigantism====
Although in general, sauropods were large, a gigantic size ( or more) was reached independently at multiple times in their evolution. Many gigantic forms existed in the Late Jurassic (specifically Kimmeridgian), such as the turiasaur &quot;Turiasaurus&quot;, the mamenchisaurids &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot; and &quot;Xinjiangtitan&quot;, the diplodocoids &quot;Maraapunisaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Supersaurus&quot; and &quot;Barosaurus&quot;, the camarasaurid &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, and the brachiosaurids &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; and &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;. Through the Early to Late Cretaceous, the giants &quot;Borealosaurus&quot;, &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;, &quot;Paralititan&quot;, &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Puertasaurus&quot;, &quot;Antarctosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dreadnoughtus&quot;, &quot;Notocolossus&quot;, &quot;Futalognkosaurus&quot;, &quot;Patagotitan&quot; and &quot;Alamosaurus&quot; lived, with all possibly being titanosaurs. One sparsely known possible giant is &quot;Huanghetitan ruyangensis&quot;, only known from long ribs. These giant species lived in the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous, appearing independently over a time span of 85 million years.

====Dwarfism in sauropods====

Two well-known island dwarf species of sauropods are the Cretaceous &quot;Magyarosaurus&quot; (at one point its identity as a dwarf was challenged) and the Jurassic &quot;Europasaurus&quot;, both from Europe. Even though these sauropods are small, the only way to prove they are true dwarfs is through a study of their bone histology. A study by Martin Sander and colleagues in 2006 examined eleven individuals of &quot;Europasaurus holgeri&quot; using bone histology and demonstrated that the small island species evolved through a decrease in the growth rate of long bones as compared to rates of growth in ancestral species on the mainland. Two other possible dwarfs are &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot;, which existed on the island of Madagascar, an isolated island in the Cretaceous, and &quot;Ampelosaurus&quot;, a titanosaur that lived on the Iberian peninsula of southern Spain and France. &quot;Amanzia&quot; from Switzerland might also be a dwarf, but this has yet to be proven. One of the most extreme cases of island dwarfism is found in &quot;Europasaurus&quot;, a relative of the much larger &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;: it was only about long, an identifying trait of the species. As for all dwarf species, their reduced growth rate led to their small size. Another taxon of tiny sauropods, the saltasaurid titanosaur &quot;Ibirania&quot;, 5.7 m (18.7 ft) long, lived a non-insular context in Upper Creaceous Brazil, and is an example of nanism resultant from other ecological pressures.

===Paleopathology and paleoparasitology===
Sauropods are rarely known for preserved injuries or signs of illnesses, but more recent discoveries show they could suffer from such pathologies. A diplodocid specimen from the Morrison Formation referred to as &quot;Dolly&quot; was described in 2022 with evidence of a severe respiratory infection. Sauropod ribs from Yunyang County, Chongqing, in southwest China show evidence of rib breakage by way of traumatic fracture, bone infection, and osteosclerosis. A sauropod tibia exhibiting initial fracture has been described from the Middle Jurassic of Yunyang County in southwestern China.

&quot;Ibirania&quot;, a nanoid titanosaur fossil from Brazil, suggests that individuals of various genera were susceptible to diseases such as osteomyelitis and parasite infestations. The specimen hails from the late cretaceous São José do Rio Preto Formation, Bauru Basin, and was described in the journal &quot;Cretaceous Research&quot; by Aureliano et al. (2021). Examination of the titanosaur&#x27;s bones revealed what appear to be parasitic blood worms similar to the prehistoric &quot;Paleoleishmania&quot; but are 10-100 times larger, that seemed to have caused the osteomyelitis. The fossil is the first known instance of an aggressive case of osteomyelitis being caused by blood worms in an extinct animal.

==History of discovery==
The first scraps of fossil remains now recognized as sauropods all came from England and were originally interpreted in a variety of different ways. Their relationship to other dinosaurs was not recognized until well after their initial discovery.

The first sauropod fossil to be scientifically described was a single tooth known by the non-Linnaean descriptor &quot;Rutellum implicatum&quot;. This fossil was described by Edward Lhuyd in 1699, but was not recognized as a giant prehistoric reptile at the time. Dinosaurs would not be recognized as a group until over a century later.

Richard Owen published the first modern scientific descriptions of sauropods in 1841, in a book and a paper naming &quot;Cardiodon&quot; and &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot;. &quot;Cardiodon&quot; was known only from two unusual, heart-shaped teeth (from which it got its name), which could not be identified beyond the fact that they came from a previously unknown large reptile. &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot; was known from slightly better, but still scrappy remains. Owen thought at the time that &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot; was a giant marine reptile related to modern crocodiles, hence its name, which means &quot;whale lizard&quot;. A year later, when Owen coined the name Dinosauria, he did not include &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot; and &quot;Cardiodon&quot; in that group.

In 1850, Gideon Mantell recognized the dinosaurian nature of several bones assigned to &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot; by Owen. Mantell noticed that the leg bones contained a medullary cavity, a characteristic of land animals. He assigned these specimens to the new genus &quot;Pelorosaurus&quot;, and grouped it together with the dinosaurs. However, Mantell still did not recognize the relationship to &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot;.

The next sauropod find to be described and misidentified as something other than a dinosaur were a set of hip vertebrae described by Harry Seeley in 1870. Seeley found that the vertebrae were very lightly constructed for their size and contained openings for air sacs (&quot;pneumatization&quot;). Such air sacs were at the time known only in birds and pterosaurs, and Seeley considered the vertebrae to come from a pterosaur. He named the new genus &quot;Ornithopsis&quot;, or &quot;bird face&quot; because of this.

When more complete specimens of &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot; were described by Phillips in 1871, he finally recognized the animal as a dinosaur related to &quot;Pelorosaurus&quot;. However, it was not until the description of new, nearly complete sauropod skeletons from the United States (representing &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;) later that year that a complete picture of sauropods emerged. An approximate reconstruction of a complete sauropod skeleton was produced by artist John A. Ryder, hired by paleontologist E.D. Cope, based on the remains of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, though many features were still inaccurate or incomplete according to later finds and biomechanical studies. Also in 1877, Richard Lydekker named another relative of &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Titanosaurus&quot;, based on an isolated vertebra.
In 1878, the most complete sauropod yet was found and described by Othniel Charles Marsh, who named it &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. With this find, Marsh also created a new group to contain &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot;, and their increasing roster of relatives to differentiate them from the other major groups of dinosaurs. Marsh named this group Sauropoda, or &quot;lizard feet&quot;.

==Classification==

The first phylogenetic definition of Sauropoda was published in 1997 by Salgado and colleagues. They defined the clade as a node-based taxon, containing &quot;the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Vulcanodon karibaensis&quot; and Eusauropoda and all of its descendants&quot;. Later, several stem-based definitions were proposed, including one by Yates (2007), who defined Sauropoda as &quot;the most inclusive clade that includes &quot;Saltasaurus loricatus&quot; but not &quot;Melanorosaurus readi&quot;&quot;.

Proponents of this definition also use the clade name Gravisauria, defined as the most recent ancestor of &quot;Tazoudasaurus naimi&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus loricatus&quot; and all of its descendants for the clade equivalent to Sauropoda as defined by Salgado &quot;et al.&quot; The clade Gravisauria was appointed by the French paleontologist Ronan Allain and Moroccan paleontologist Najat Aquesbi in 2008 when a cladistic analysis of the dinosaur found by Allain, &quot;Tazoudasaurus&quot;, as the outcome was that the family Vulcanodontidae. The group includes &quot;Tazoudasaurus&quot; and &quot;Vulcanodon&quot;, and the sister taxon Eusauropoda, but also certain species such as &quot;Antetonitrus&quot;, &quot;Gongxianosaurus&quot; and &quot;Isanosaurus&quot; that do not belong in Vulcanodontidae but to an even more basic position occupied in Sauropoda. It made sense to have Sauropoda compared to this, more derived group that included Vulcanodontidae and Eusauropoda in a definition: defined as the group formed by the last common ancestor of &quot;Tazoudasaurus&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; (Bonaparte and Powell, 1980) and all its descendants. Aquesbi mentioned two synapomorphies, shared derived characteristics of Gravisauria: the vertebrae are wider side to side than front to rear and possession of asymmetrical condyles femoris at the bottom of the femur. Those were previously not thought to be Eusauropoda synapomorphies but Allian found these properties also on &quot;Tazoudasaurus&quot;.

Gravisauria split off in the Early Jurassic, around the Pliensbachian and Toarcian, 183 million years ago, and Aquesbi thought that this was part of a much larger revolution in the fauna, which includes the disappearance of Prosauropoda, Coelophysoidea and basal Thyreophora, which they attributed to a worldwide mass extinction.

The phylogenetic relationships of the sauropods have largely stabilised in recent years, though there are still some uncertainties, such as the placement of &quot;Euhelopus&quot;, &quot;Haplocanthosaurus&quot;, &quot;Jobaria&quot; and Nemegtosauridae.

<text>The Eland is an air-portable light armoured car based on the Panhard AML. Designed and built for long-range reconnaissance, it mounts either a 60mm (2.4 in) breech-loading mortar or a Denel 90mm (3.5 in) gun on a very compact chassis. Although lightly armoured, the vehicle&#x27;s permanent 4X4 drive makes it faster over flat terrain than many tanks.

The Eland was developed for the South African Defence Force (SADF) in South Africa&#x27;s first major arms programme since World War II, with prototypes completed in 1963. By 1991, 1,600 examples had been built for home and export; prominent foreign operators included Morocco and Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia). Local overhauls incorporating lessons from internal operations have resulted in a vehicle capable of withstanding the unforgiving Southern African environment and highly mobile operational style of the SADF.

==Development history==
===Background===
For many years the standard armoured car of the South African Defence Force was the Daimler Ferret, which was developed in the late 1940s and armed with a single general-purpose machine gun. By the mid-1960s, Ferret spares were becoming difficult to obtain, and its armament was considered less than adequate. In 1961, South Africa accordingly secured a similar platform with a much wider range of armament installations: the French Panhard AML. That July a South African military delegation headed by Minister of Defence Jim Fouché and Commandant-General Pieter Grobbelaar, chief of the SADF, went to France to negotiate a licensing agreement with Panhard. The AML was favoured because the SADF&#x27;s priorities at the time were fighting a possible counter-insurgency campaign or an unconventional bush war, the basic requirements of which were light armoured vehicles with the greatest mobility and most simplified maintenance.

One hundred AMLs were purchased, presumably for preliminary evaluation purposes, as well as enough turrets, engines, and other associated parts for the later assembly of another 800 in South Africa. Panhard also approved a licence for domestic production of the AML chassis in South African plants. A separate licence was obtained from the French government&#x27;s &quot;Direction technique des armements terrestres&quot; (DTAT) between 1964 and 1965 for the manufacture of the AML turrets and armament. The result was the VA (&quot;Vehicle A&quot;) Mk2, first offered to the SADF&#x27;s armoured car regiments and reconnaissance commands in 1964. Bids were accepted from four local companies for the manufacture of 300 AMLs with working armament, along with another 150 turretless demonstrators; this contract was claimed by Sandock-Austral, now Land Systems OMC. The production lines were set up with technical assistance from Henschel, an engineering firm based in the Federal Republic of Germany. Panhard subcontracted the project to Henschel rather than carrying out the work itself as it was anxious to avoid criticism from its potential clients in other African states.
Sandock VAs initially fared rather poorly; all 56 models furbished in 1966 were rejected by the South African Army. An extensive rebuild programme followed - the Panhards were returned to the manufacturer, completely disassembled, restructured, and trialled again. These new vehicles claimed a local content of forty per cent but remained heavily bolstered by components imported from France in 1961. Upon undergoing several upgrades to the steering (Mk2) and brakes (Mk3), each vehicle was also equipped with a custom fuel system; the electric clutches were concurrently replaced by more conventional pressure plate clutches (Mk4). While South Africa&#x27;s AMLs remained externally similar to their French counterparts, up to two-thirds of their parts were of local origin by 1967, the main part of that balance being a new water cooled inline-4 cylinder petrol engine installed in the Mk5. Subsequent models were officially designated &quot;Eland&quot;.

Panhard&#x27;s initial licensing contract with the South African government extended to the local assembly or manufacture of up to 1,000 AMLs. Furthermore, all vehicles produced under the terms of this licence could only be re-exported with written permission from the French Minister of Defence. It is unclear whether these restrictions extended to the second generation of Elands, which were produced with wholly South African parts and components beginning in 1973. South Africa may have renewed the original Panhard licence as part of a larger agreement with France concerning the transfer of arms and defence technology around January 1974; another 700 Elands were manufactured between 1974 and 1986. By 1985 production had reached two hundred vehicles a year. A surplus of parts were manufactured for the Eland as well as the original AML series; according to General Jannie Geldenhuys, after 1979 Panhard actually fulfilled orders for older AML parts it no longer produced by sourcing them from South Africa.

Operated by a crew of three, each Eland was built on a small and remarkably lightweight 4X4 chassis with a height of 2.5 metres, a length of 5.12 metres, and a weight of 6 metric tons. The Eland had a maximum range of 450 kilometres and a mileage of 2 kilometres per litre. As South Africa was primarily interested in a light patrol vehicle armed for counter-insurgency purposes, most Elands were armed with the 60mm Brandt Mle CM60A1 gun-mortar, better known by its South African manufacturing code &quot;K1&quot; and also designated in SADF service as the &quot;M2&quot;, as well as two 7.62mm Browning machine guns. This was known as the &quot;Eland-60&quot;.

The second most common variant was designed specifically to fulfill a South African requirement for a gun-armed armoured car capable of furnishing mobile fire support for the mounted units and undertaking aggressive reconnaissance as needed. As the SADF had been organised along the lines of Commonwealth doctrine in general and British doctrine in particular, it wanted a vehicle capable of filling the same role as the Alvis Saladin. Although the Saladin was evaluated favourably since it shared most of its interchangeable parts with the army&#x27;s Alvis Saracen armoured personnel carriers, the AML licence had already been purchased and there was an advantage to fulfilling the same requirement with another preexisting vehicle type. Negotiations to purchase Saladins from the United Kingdom also stalled after the election of Harold Wilson and his incoming Labour Party government, which took a harder line on arms sales to South Africa.

In response to SADF inquiries concerning an AML more similar to the Saladin in terms of armament, Panhard produced the AML-90. There was substantially more firepower in the new variant: its 90mm low-pressure rifled cannon, with a range of 1,200 metres, enabled it to knock out all but the heaviest contemporary tanks. This evolved into the &quot;Eland-90&quot; in South African service.

===Service life===
Elands formed the mainstay of the South African Armoured Corps for nearly three decades, although as early as 1968 SADF officials were discussing their replacement or supplementation with something more suited to countering tank warfare as the prospect of conventional military conflict in southern Africa became increasingly likely. That year the armoured corps undertook a feasibility study for replacing the Eland with a larger, more mobile, and more heavily armed wheeled vehicle. While acknowledging the Eland was sufficient for border patrol and counter-insurgency, South African strategists were also concerned that it was unsuited for conventional battlefields. During a wargaming exercise designed to simulate a foreign invasion of South West Africa, the SADF found that the Eland-90 suffered from three major disadvantages: it had no trench-crossing ability, its off-road mobility was limited due to its four wheels and high ground pressure, and the 90mm cannon was ineffective against enemy armour at long range. In 1969, South African officials proposed fitting the existing fleet with ENTAC wire-guided anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). This was never implemented but the advantages of an ATGM capability in armoured car regiments were recognised as a means to compensate for the mediocre range of the Eland-90&#x27;s main armament. Another proposal for an Eland variant armed with an autocannon appeared in 1971. The armoured corps evaluated several Elands armed with 20mm and 40mm autocannons between 1971 and 1972 and finally settled on the Hispano-Suiza HS.820 as its armament of choice. This was known as the &quot;Eland-20&quot; but was not adopted by the SADF.

In 1970 the South African Army was operating 500 Elands of various marks, with another 356 on order. The fleet then consisted of 369 Eland-60s and 131 Eland-90s. This was followed by the Eland Mk6 programme, which entailed older models upgraded to Mk5 standards. By 1975 the army had 1,016 Eland Mk5s and Mk6s in service. The Eland was first tested in combat that year against Cuban and People&#x27;s Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) forces during Operation Savannah. Reports of PT-76 and T-34-85 tanks being fielded by FAPLA during the Angolan Civil War perturbed South African military advisers then involved in training FAPLA&#x27;s rivals, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and its armed wing. The advisers reported that UNITA&#x27;s anti-tank capabilities were next to nonexistent and requested a squadron of SADF armoured cars, along with their crews, to help turn the tide against FAPLA. Twenty-two Eland-90s were flown out to UNITA&#x27;s headquarters at Silva Porto in mid-October 1975, and soon clashed with FAPLA armour. Elands were to acquire a fearsome combat reputation in Angola, where they earned the moniker &quot;Red Ants&quot; due to unorthodox but effective crew tactics and the lack of any equivalent Cuban or FAPLA vehicles. Less than two months later, Cuban general Abelardo Colomé Ibarra cited his inability to counter the Elands&#x27; superior manoeuvrability as one of the greatest tactical challenges facing the Cuban-FAPLA coalition in Angola. Nevertheless, with the onset of the Angolan rainy season the wheeled vehicles were increasingly hampered by mud, and their crews found fighting capability constrained when operating on terrain better suited for tracked vehicles. They criticised the lowness of the hull as well, which made sighting difficult over thick bush. The Elands&#x27; reliability was also somewhat called into question: nearly half the armoured cars in the squadron were rendered unserviceable at one time or another due to engine failures. These limitations emphasised the need for the development of a new mark of Eland further modified for southern African conditions.

The Eland continued to enjoy distinction in SADF service, especially with the 1 Special Service Battalion and 61 Mechanised Infantry Battalion Group. During Operation Protea and Operation Askari in 1981 and 1983, respectively, Eland-90s proved capable of eliminating Cuban and FAPLA T-34-85 and T-54/55 tanks at close range. The SADF began to gradually retire its Elands beginning in the mid-1980s, replacing them with the larger and notably more dependable Ratel-90 and Ratel-60 infantry fighting vehicles, which could carry the same armament but also a squad of infantry.
Once envisaged only as a scout car, the Eland auspiciously doubled in the role of an assault gun and an ersatz tank destroyer—but its obsolescence was highlighted by several factors, namely a flammable petrol engine which was especially vulnerable to rocket-propelled grenades or mine explosions, and its limited off-road mobility. The effectiveness of the low-pressure 90mm gun against modern tanks was also questionable; during Operation Askari Eland-90s&#x27; high-explosive anti-tank shells rarely penetrated enemy T-54s without multiple hits.

Although they remained relatively popular with the armoured corps, Elands were not well-regarded by the mechanised infantry due to several unsuccessful attempts to integrate them with Ratel-mounted combat teams. The Eland simply lacked the range and mobility to keep pace with the Ratels during a firefight, and was more prone to technical malfunctions in the bush. The squat, compact vehicles were often ridiculed as &quot;noddy cars&quot; by infantrymen due to their quaint profile and small size as compared to the much heavier Ratel. This derisive nickname may have also been a reference to an Eland-90&#x27;s tendency to rock on its axles while firing its main gun. Another train of thought was that it resembled the vehicle of childhood book character named Noddy with its oversized tires. Nevertheless, it was later adopted with affectionate pride by Eland crews.

The final variant to enter production, the Eland Mk7, was introduced in 1979. It possessed new power brakes, a modified transmission, and a lengthier hull for accommodating taller South African crewmen. A domed cupola with vision blocks was also added over the commander&#x27;s hatch. Hard lessons driven home by Operation Savannah ensured the new Elands were also designed for operating long distances from supply and logistical centres, with maximum ease of maintenance in the field. For example, the engine was now mounted on a rail frame so it could be removed and replaced in under forty minutes. The Eland Mk7 was kept in production for another eight years, until its basic technology had become quite dated despite continuous upgrades. The South African Armoured Corps retired most of its Elands from combat service in the late 1980s, utilising them primarily for training Ratel-90 crews. In October 1988, South Africa unveiled a new indigenous armoured car known as the Rooikat. The Rooikat, which had emerged from the original requirement for a larger and more effectively armed vehicle to supplant the Eland series on conventional battlefields, was much more mobile and carried a sophisticated 76mm high-velocity cannon capable of engaging armour at longer standoff ranges. In 1994, the Eland-60 and Eland-90 were formally retired from the newly integrated South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in favour of the Rooikat.

==Combat history==
===South African Border War===
====Initial service====

South Africa&#x27;s determination to retain the disputed territory of South West Africa, which it had governed essentially as a fifth province since World War I, resulted in an armed insurgency by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), the militant wing of the nationalist South West African People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO). Insurgent activity took the form of ambushes and selective target attacks, particularly in the Caprivi Strip near the Zambian border. Reflecting a trend characteristic of many Anglophone Commonwealth states, local police were initially granted responsibility for managing counter-insurgency operations rather than the South African armed forces. However, by 1969 the security situation in Caprivi had deteriorated to the point that the SADF was forced to deploy a troop of Elands and several companies of infantry there.

A year later, PLAN began adopting mine warfare as an integral part of its attempts to hinder the mobility of South African convoys on the limited road network. Mine-laying was often used as a means to throw the convoys into disarray prior to an ambush. This tactic resulted in some of the heaviest SADF and police casualties thus far and evolved into one of the most defining features of PLAN&#x27;s war effort for the next two decades. The SADF&#x27;s immediate solution was to utilise its Elands for convoy escort purposes, as they were the only vehicles it possessed capable of surviving a mine explosion and also suppressing an ambush. An Eland-60 or Eland-90 was delegated to lead each convoy, with the other drivers continuing in its tracks. However, it soon became clear this practice was not an effective countermeasure. The armoured cars&#x27; petrol engines were vulnerable to the risk of fire whenever they detonated a mine. PLAN also responded by acquiring anti-tank mines, namely Soviet TM-46s, in large quantities.

On one occasion an Eland-90 detonated two TM-46s, which sent the vehicle airborne and hurled it about thirty metres away, after which it landed on its turret. Although the three crew members escaped serious injury, incidents like these demonstrated that the Eland simply lacked the mass to absorb the explosive force of an anti-tank mine. For the SADF and the police, the only other viable option was the adoption of armoured personnel carriers with mine-proof hulls that could move quickly on roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine like the TM-46 was encountered. This would trigger a series of experiments aimed at producing a new class of military vehicle, the mine resistant and ambush protected vehicle (MRAP). From 1974 onward, Elands began to be replaced in their traditional role of convoy escort by specialised mineproofed vehicles.

====Operation Savannah====

The collapse of Portuguese colonial rule in South West Africa&#x27;s northern neighbour, Angola, led to dramatic changes in South African foreign and defence policy. Factional infighting between the three rival Angolan nationalist movements pursuing their own separate strategies directed towards consolidating political power and influence in the colonial state was almost inevitable; by mid 1975 the country had degenerated into outright civil war. South Africa discreetly sponsored two of three Angolan factions, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), in the hopes of eliciting their cooperation with the SADF to deny PLAN sanctuary in Angola; this project was known as Operation Savannah. However, both UNITA and the FNLA were defeated and driven from the Angolan capital, Luanda, by the third faction—People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) that July.

Unlike the FNLA and UNITA, the MPLA possessed a militant wing, the People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA), which was well-equipped for conventional warfare and aided by an infusion of arms from the Soviet Union and Cuban military advisers. Instrumental in its capture of Luanda were a number of second-hand Soviet T-34-85 tanks, likely manned by well-drilled and experienced Cuban crews. Neither the FNLA nor UNITA possessed anti-tank weaponry, and their lightly armed troops were no match for the FAPLA armour. As part of its own covert intervention programme in Angola, the Central Intelligence Agency was able to persuade Zaire to donate some Panhard AML-90s and M40 recoilless rifles to the FNLA and UNITA in exchange for receiving more modern American weaponry. South Africa assembled an advisory and liaison team which included six armour instructors to train the UNITA AML crews. The SADF advisers planned to have three crews trained in several weeks, but they were not afforded this luxury as a FAPLA offensive was already underway to seize UNITA&#x27;s headquarters at Nova Lisboa. Permission was granted by the South African political leadership to have the AMLs manned by the instructors until such a time as the UNITA crews could be trained to a minimal standard. UNITA and the SADF advisory team first clashed with a FAPLA armoured unit at the village of Norton de Matos, where they came under heavy fire from T-34-85 and PT-76 tanks. The South Africans attempted to fight off their opponents with their AML-90s and some ENTAC anti-tank missiles, but were forced to withdraw after a fierce skirmish.

The action at Norton de Metos had deeply shaken South Africa&#x27;s confidence in UNITA&#x27;s ability to win the war against FAPLA on its own, especially with its limited arsenal. During a meeting with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi and the heads of the advisory mission on October 7, the SADF instructors argued that they would need better armour assets than the handful of dilapidated AMLs possessed by Savimbi. Their request was approved on the condition that any extension of the SADF&#x27;s operational capacities in Angola remain strictly covert. All equipment, weapons, vehicles, and ammunition bound for the Angolan front were to be supplied through nonconventional channels and unmarked. SADF uniforms and insignia were explicitly prohibited. On October 9, a squadron of Eland-90s and their crews were hurriedly deployed to the border, ready to be airlifted deep into Angola five days later. The personnel involved were stripped of all their identifiable equipment, even their dog tags, and re-issued with nondescript uniforms and personal weapons impossible to trace. They were told to pose as mercenaries if questioned. Officials exempted Elands from the ban on South African weapons because it was well known that UNITA and the FNLA operated the externally identical AML, and they were regarded as suitably anonymous. To reinforce this impression, SADF crew members painted the armoured cars with UNITA markings. The Elands were attached to two separate composite battlegroups of motorised infantry, code named &quot;Task Force Zulu&quot; and &quot;Task Force Foxbat&quot;, respectively. Their objectives were to destroy the FAPLA forces south of Luanda and advance northwards, seizing as much territory as they could for the FNLA and UNITA before Angola&#x27;s formal independence date on November 11, six weeks away. It was intended for Eland troops to merely support motorised infantry on roads, but since no other armour was available the South Africans deployed them as column spearheads. Eland-90s performed reconnaissance by fire, depending on their speed and mobility to carry them through potential ambushes. The SADF&#x27;s use of light, fast-moving Elands backed by truck-mounted infantry advancing at full speed allowed it to retain the initiative and keep FAPLA continually off balance. Task Force Zulu was able to cover about ninety kilometres per day, even when the rainy season slowed momentum. By the time FAPLA redeployed sufficient forces along its southern front to halt the SADF advance, Zulu and Foxbat had advanced over 500 kilometres and captured eighteen major towns and cities.

FAPLA hastily established a rough line of defence from Norton de Matos to the strategic railway junction at Catengue, which lay on the highway between Nova Lisboa and Luanda. Unbeknownst to the SADF, Catengue was situated near a FAPLA training camp which housed a significant contingent of Cuban advisers. The Cubans planned an elaborate defence of Catengue, intending to pin the South African armoured cars on the road and strip away the supporting FNLA foot soldiers with a composite battery of 82mm mortars and Grad-P 122mm rocket artillery. As the Eland crews attempted to redeploy to suppress the defenders, a FAPLA anti-tank section with B-10 recoilless rifles and RPG-7s would finish them off. Although they had to come to a halt to return fire, the Elands escaped destruction during the actual engagement by rapidly manoeuvring between firing positions. While the armoured cars laid down suppressing fire on the mortar pits and kept the FAPLA troops preoccupied, the supporting SADF and FNLA infantrymen regrouped and carried out a successful flanking attack. The defenders were routed. Four Cubans had died during the battle for Catengue, seven were wounded, and another thirteen listed as missing in action.

Unaware that Catengue had fallen, several companies of Cuban and FAPLA infantry and an armoured reconnaissance platoon advanced south to reinforce the junction. The Eland-90s took up positions alongside the narrow highway and ambushed the approaching FAPLA vehicles one at a time, destroying them. Meanwhile, the revelation that Cuban advisers had been engaged by South African regulars with armour of their own prompted President Fidel Castro to approve a request from FAPLA for direct military assistance. In the following weeks, Cuban combat troops began arriving in Luanda by sea and air. Upon their arrival, they were supplied with T-34-85 tanks, hundreds of which had been shipped directly to Luanda by the Soviet Union to avoid transshipment delays in Havana.

The next major engagement between the Cubans and South African armour did not occur until November 23. One of the last settlements the SADF needed to capture before it could reach within striking distance of Luanda itself was Porto Amboim. To slow the SADF&#x27;s advance, Cuban sappers had destroyed all the bridges over the Cuvo River south of Porto Amboim. Undeterred, both South African battlegroups began searching for alternative routes towards the east. More Cuban units redeployed to block their advance again at Quibala, a town which sat astride the only other highway to Luanda. While reconnoitering potential routes by which to attack Quibala from the east, Foxbat encountered an intact bridge over the Mabassa River near the village of Ebo. The defenders had anticipated that the SADF might attempt to cross the river there and had laid an ambush with recoilless rifles, BM-21 Grads, and a ZiS-3 anti-tank gun. When the South African armoured cars began crossing the bridge, the Cubans opened fire. The first Eland on the bridge was immediately knocked out by an RPG or recoilless rifle round, followed in rapid succession by three more. The surviving Elands on the opposite bank found it difficult to take evasive action due to their inability to manoeuvre in thick mud, and another three were destroyed. Futile attempts were made to recover the armoured cars for several hours, after which Foxbat withdrew. FAPLA later extricated the damaged and wrecked Elands on site and towed them away for propaganda purposes.

With its advance stymied for the time being, the SADF continued its search for alternative routes to Quibala and discovered another surviving bridge on the Nhia River, which had been damaged but not thoroughly demolished by Cuban sappers. This was known informally as &quot;Bridge 14&quot;. South African army engineers began to repair the bridge under the cover of darkness on December 11, allowing the accompanying Elands to launch a surprise attack across it at dawn. Cuban mortar crews and anti-tank platoons armed with 9M14 Malyutka missiles had begun to deploy into ambush positions just beyond the bridge; however, several were wiped out when the SADF took the precaution of shelling the opposite riverbank with artillery. As they advanced the Eland crews also avoided the centre of the bridge, where the Cubans had trained their missiles. Taken by surprise, the defending Cuban and FAPLA units began a disorderly withdrawal. They regrouped at the village of Catofe, about sixteen kilometres south of Quibala, where they were reinforced by a company of T-34-85 tanks and prepared to make a final stand. Foxbat&#x27;s Elands approached within five kilometres of Catofe but did not advance any further, owing to concerns about having overextended their lines.

While the campaign south of Quibala was in progress, two new battle groups modelled after Foxbat and Zulu, codenamed X-Ray and Orange respectively, had been formed in Silva Porto to fight the Cuban-FAPLA alliance in eastern Angola. Orange was dispatched northwards to capture Malanje while X-Ray moved further east to secure the railway line from Benguela. On 18 December, the first &quot;armour-to-armour&quot; engagement between South Africa and Cuba occurred when a troop of Eland-90s attached to Battle Group Orange reconnoitring potential river crossings east of Bridge 14 encountered three T-34-85s on the opposite bank. The Elands opened fire, destroying the lead tank and forcing the others to withdraw.

South Africa&#x27;s decision to terminate Operation Savannah in the face of heavy international opposition and an increasingly formidable Cuban troop presence was made around January 1976, and the last SADF forces departed Angola in March. A detailed study of the Eland&#x27;s advantages and shortcomings during that campaign was subsequently undertaken by the South African Armoured Corps. Much of the lessons learned from Angolan operations could also be readily applied to northern South West Africa, where the characteristics of the annual rainy season, compounded by dense vegetation and muddy terrain, were quite similar. Eland crews found that the density of the bush impeded their mobility, line of vision, and the traversing angle of their turrets. The region was also prone to dry flood plains, which filled into marshlike &quot;oshanas&quot; during the rainy season and posed a notoriously difficult obstacle for the four-wheeled armoured cars. While the Eland-90s brought to bear enormous firepower, they possessed limited ammunition stowage capacity. During Operation Savannah, it was not uncommon for an Eland to expend all its stored ammunition during a firefight and have to withdraw to the rear to resupply. Fourthly, the Eland was not designed as a troop-carrying vehicle. It possessed no interior space to accommodate an infantry section, forcing the attached SADF infantrymen to proceed on foot or ride in unarmoured trucks which offered minimal protection during ambushes. These issues highlighted the need for a dedicated infantry fighting vehicle in SADF service, which soon emerged in the form of the Ratel.

====Operations Reindeer and Sceptic====
Elands were again mobilised by the SADF for Operation Reindeer in May 1978, a coordinated strike on three suspected PLAN training complexes in Angola. For the purposes of this operation, the SADF experimented with an integrated combat team consisting of mechanised infantry mounted in the new Ratels, backed by attached Eland-90s providing fire support as needed. Three combat teams of Ratels and Eland-90s were created for the assault on a heavily fortified PLAN camp known as the &quot;Dombondola Complex&quot;, also code named Objective Vietnam. One troop of Eland-90s would follow the Ratels during the attack, while the other two were to redeploy on the nearby highway linking Cuamato to Chetequera, where they could intercept stragglers or potential guerrilla reinforcements. The combat teams were backed by rear echelon which included a battery of towed BL 5.5-inch Medium Guns and logistics vehicles carrying enough fuel and ammunition for the journey; these were escorted by Eland-60s in a supporting role.

During the course of Operation Reindeer, numerous Elands repeatedly stalled in mud and even loose sand, leaving no alternative but to tow them out with the much heavier Ratels. The speed at which the combat team was able to cover ground was negatively affected by the Elands&#x27; poor momentum on broken terrain. Their petrol engines were also an issue, since this factor necessitated a separate logistics apparatus from those of the Ratels. When the attack on Vietnam began, the Eland-90s deployed into a static formation and began firing on the PLAN defenders. This would prove to be a fatal error, as the close proximity of the Elands to each other and their crews&#x27; failure to exploit their mobility allowed the guerrillas to concentrate their mortars and anti-tank weapons on the lightly armoured vehicles. It also limited their arcs of fire. Due to poor visibility on the battlefield, turret crews were inclined to leave all their hatches open for maximum situational awareness. The open hatches resulted in injuries and deaths due to mortar fragments. Additionally, the crews raised complaints about the 90mm ammunition, which was difficult to load and resulted in stoppages due to some inefficient plastic components.

As a result of the lessons incorporated during Operation Reindeer, the SADF and Sandock-Austral made several changes to the Eland and its main armament. The latest mark of Eland to be introduced incorporated a raised commander&#x27;s cupola with vision blocks, similar to that of the Ratel. This improved the crew commander&#x27;s observation capacity without compromising the protection afforded by the turret armour. Furthermore, the use of 90mm ammunition sourced from France was discontinued and production of local 90mm ammunition optimised for the Eland was accelerated. Finally, the armoured corps acknowledged that in a composite mechanised infantry group, the Eland-90 was not suited to fight in tandem with the Ratel. The former&#x27;s fire support potential was useful, but its mobility was inferior to that of the Ratel and the need to maintain a separate logistics apparatus for a separate vehicle type, especially one with a petrol engine, was not deemed economical. These concerns were addressed in the short run by mating a Ratel chassis to an Eland-90&#x27;s turret and 90mm gun, creating the Ratel-90. The Ratel-90 was seen as the ideal solution, since it simplified logistics and did not compromise the overall mobility of a mechanised combat team. Its six wheels, longer operating range, and 72 stowed rounds of 90mm ammunition were also considered much more suitable for mobile bush operations.

In June 1980 the SADF launched Operation Sceptic, the largest combined arms operation undertaken by any South African military force since World War II. Sceptic was essentially identical to Reindeer in terms of objectives and organisation: there were three mechanised combat teams equipped with Ratels, including the new Ratel-90s; the SADF also attached a fourth combat team consisting of Eland-90s and support infantry in Buffel armoured personnel carriers. There were also fifth and sixth combat teams composed entirely of paratroops, who functioned as light infantry, and a rear echelon. Their objective was to eliminate three PLAN training camps in southern Angola. The Eland-90s were given the task of leading the combat teams because the narrow width of their wheels made it difficult for them to follow in the wide tracks left by the Ratels. South African strategists also recognised that the Elands retained the poorest momentum and placed them at the front of the column to prevent them from being separated from the Ratels in the thick bush. As a consequence of this decision the combat teams advanced at a maximum speed of about 20 km/h. When the terrain became more challenging, the advance slowed to about 10 km/h. Due to their limited operating range several of the Elands ran out of fuel and had to be towed to the objective. When the combat teams reached the first PLAN facility, the stalled Elands were inadvertently towed by the Ratels into an insurgent ambush. Their crews found themselves unable to support the mechanised assault group while fighting for their own survival, and the 90mm guns were used as extremely close range to suppress counterattacking PLAN forces.

====Operation Protea====
SWAPO cadres and their Angolan hosts were undeterred by preceding SADF campaigns. Partisan recruitment continued in earnest, and the difficulties experienced in storming &quot;Smokeshell&quot; forced South African tacticians to recognise that conventional cross-border operations were intricate affairs. Nevertheless, &quot;Operation Sceptic&quot; had demonstrated that pressure on the home front could be relieved with aggressive preemptive or counterstrike strategy. In August 1981, four mechanised battlegroups staged &quot;Operation Protea&quot; - converging on SWAPO camps at Ongiva and Xangongo. At least three were equipped with Eland-90s, the remainder of the force being bolstered by Ratels and Eland-60s (again seconded to an artillery troop). &quot;Protea&quot; had three objectives: to disrupt SWAPO&#x27;s logistical apparatus in southern Angola, to preempt further infiltration of South West Africa, and to capture or destroy as much military equipment as possible. This offensive was destined to encounter an unexpectedly large presence of Angolan regular forces, who brought their heavy armour into offensive action for the first time. In preparation for potential encounters with FAPLA T-34-85 tanks, elements of 61 Mechanised practised &quot;firebelt&quot; actions, integrating mutual support and specialised manoeuvres. It was, however, stripped of its Ratel-90 antitank platoon for &quot;Protea&quot;, necessitating a greater dependence on the Eland: a vehicle unable to keep pace with Ratels during rapid firebelts.
South African forces advanced on 23 August, cutting Xangongo off from Ongiva and establishing a blocking force near Chicusse. They stormed into Xangongo at 1:25 PM the following day, though it was late afternoon before the battle intensified. This settlement was garrisoned by FAPLA&#x27;s 19th Brigade, which included a T-34 company and mechanised squadron. Although Elands were vulnerable to the T-34&#x27;s 85mm gun, their vastly superior mobility and the experience of SADF crews made a considerable difference. Three tanks had been demolished by late afternoon. Elands were also deployed with the blocking force on the main axis of the Xangongo-Cahama highway, where it was hoped that their speed on tarred surfaces could be better exploited. They did not have to wait long. In the evening a sizeable FAPLA convoy, consisting of armoured personnel carriers, infantry, and artillery, was glimpsed fleeing towards Cahama. Upon identifying the point vehicle as a BRDM-2, a South African spotter ordered &quot;skiet hom met ‘n 90,&quot; (&quot;shoot it with a 90[mm]&quot;). Hit by three rounds, the vehicle ignited. A number of trailing BTR-152s, GAZ-66s, and BM-21s were also captured or destroyed.

The assault on Ongiva began with an air strike on 27 August, while artillery engaged in knocking out predetermined FAPLA or SWAPO targets. Angolan troops counterattacked on at least two occasions with T-34s, three of which were annihilated by concentrated fire from the Ratel or Eland-90 squadrons. In hindsight, tanks played a relatively limited role in the defence. Most had been dug in for use as static artillery - firing from entrenched positions near FAPLA camps and installations. This restricted their trajectory. Moreover, the T-34s faced south; their crews were thus unable to counter South African armoured cars arriving from the north.

====Operation Askari====
At the end of &quot;Operation Protea&quot;, South Africa had captured over 3,000 tonnes of ammunition, overrun some 38,850 square kilometres of Angolan territory, and inflicted serious casualties on SWAPO and FAPLA. Most significantly, the SADF installed its own garrisons at Xangongo and Ongiva - leaving behind two companies detached from the South West African Territorial Force (SWATF), an Eland squadron, and the special forces of 32 Battalion. Throughout 1982 Eland-90s were a common sight on the roads around Xangongo, deterring SWAPO from reentering the town.

By 1983, FAPLA had completed an exhaustive two-year retraining and reequipment programme, greatly increasing in size, sophistication, and competence under the eye of Soviet military advisors. Luanda was spending 35% of its budget on external defence, and Mikoyan MiG-21s were beginning to disrupt the traditional South African Air Force superiority. Within five months of &quot;Protea&quot;, Cuba had committed another 7,000 troops to Angola. They also brought T-54/55 tanks, which were more formidable than the antiquated T-34.

In April South Africa began compiling intelligence on SWAPO plans to move an additional 1,000 guerrillas into the operational area, using the Cunene rainy season for cover. Modelled after &quot;Protea&quot;, &quot;Operation Askari&quot; began on 20 December 1983: headed for insurgent staging areas identified by aerial reconnaissance, four battalion-sized combat groups crossed into Angola. &quot;Askari&quot; called for a single unit of Eland-90s, which were scraped together from Regiment Mooirivier and Regiment Molopo. Unlike past operations, their crews were predominantly reservists. The Elands were assigned to &quot;Task Force Victor&quot;, which was to acquire the unfortunate reputation of being &quot;Askari&quot; poorest element. Marshalled against them were four FAPLA brigades stationed at Caiundo, Cuvelai, Mulondo, and Cahama, or one-seventh of the Angolan Army. Soviet commander Valentin Varennikov, who was instrumental in directing the Angolan defence, was confident that &quot;given their numerical strength and armament, the brigades...[would] be able to repel any South African attack&quot;.

The SADF, however, had no intention of making frontal attacks that could be costly in lives or resources. &quot;Askari&quot; depended on being able to keep FAPLA at bay through air strikes, long-distance bombardment, and light probing. In keeping with this principle, &quot;Task Force Victor&quot; marched east through Mongua before harassing FAPLA&#x27;s 11th Brigade at Cuvelai, their intended target. Angolan defenders responded with heavy artillery. A disappointed General Constand Viljoen warned that if no major successes were achieved before 31 December, the operation might not continue. But Cuvelai had been identified as a key location in SWAPO&#x27;s upcoming monsoon offensive, and had to be neutralised before &quot;Victor&quot; could be withdrawn. A flurry of new orders were issued accordingly: probing actions were to cease, and the enemy attacked &quot;forcefully&quot; prior to the 31st. The SWAPO camps near the town were the objective: South African officers were confident that neither Angola nor two adjacent Cuban battalions nearby would intervene.

In line with his new directives, &quot;Victor&quot; commandant Faan Greyling was instructed to advance from the northeast. But this route was barred by the Cuvelai River, which was in flood and complicated by the heaviest rains in living memory. Predictably, the Elands got stuck as they struggled up the muddy banks of every stream. SWAPO was waiting for &quot;Victor&quot; in force behind artillery, sixteen minefields, and ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns. Faulty intelligence also complicated the attack: FAPLA did come to SWAPO&#x27;s assistance with 13 T-55 tanks. As his men were poorly equipped with antitank weapons, Greyling&#x27;s Eland-90s had to bear the brunt of the armoured thrust. Their inadequate low velocity cannon had great difficulty against the T-55s, often dispensing multiple shells before penetrating the tanks&#x27; armour. Crew tactics were to encircle single tanks with an Eland troop (four cars) and keep on shooting until their target burned. This required intense coordination between the Eland commanders, who directed each other by radio until they were able to concentrate their fire on a T-55&#x27;s exposed side or rear, preferably while its turret was pointed in another direction.

Sensing an opportunity to disengage, Greyling called off the attack, but it was too late. Exhausted by the intensity of the firefight and already demoralised by their repeated failures, the South Africans retreated. Headquarters demanded he resume the advance—Greyling retorted he would not do so without coherent planning or reconnaissance. It eventually fell to an overworked 61 Mechanised to complete the objective. Due to the higher profile of their Ratel-90s they could locate T-55s over dense vegetation before the Angolan gunners in turn spotted them, an advantage Elands did not possess. The armoured cars succeeded in knocking out at least five tanks on the river, which were captured and retained for inspection. South Africa finally took what was left of Cuvelai on January 7.

====Later service====
The mediocre performance of improvised tank destroyers at Cuvelai convinced Ep van Lill, commander of 61 Mechanised, that his men could no longer be asked to fight tanks with armoured cars. Van Lill informed General Viljoen that the Eland-90 simply could not stand up to the heavier protection and armament of T-54/55s. &quot;Tank busting&quot; expended too much 90mm ammunition and fatigued recoil systems. As demonstrated during &quot;Askari&quot;, crew morale was also affected when ordered to take on T-55s in their vulnerable vehicles. This contradicted South African Armoured Corps (SAAC) doctrine, which was to fight tanks with tanks.

A few weeks later, van Lill was vindicated when a squadron of British Centurions - modified in South Africa as the &quot;Olifant Mk1&quot; - were delivered to the 61 Mechanised base in Omuthiya. As Angola was not seen as a conventional threat to South West Africa itself, the retention of tanks in that territory was not regarded as cost-effective and Olifant crews frequently rotated out. During Operations &quot;Moduler&quot;, &quot;Hooper&quot;, and &quot;Packer&quot;, Ratel-90s were again used in the role of tank destroyers.

&quot;Task Force Victor&quot; performance during &quot;Askari&quot; left much to be desired. At SADF review meetings, the reservists involved were bluntly criticised as &quot;the worst battle group in 82 Mechanised Brigade&quot;. More attention was devoted to improving reservist leadership and morale. Also noted was the antiquity of the Eland, which was beginning to hinder operations. It was not deployed in Angola by the SADF again.

===South West Africa===
Although most Elands were gradually removed from front-line service with the SADF after 1984, being relegated to the role of training vehicles for Ratel-90 crews, a large number continued to be deployed by the SWATF during internal counter-insurgency operations against PLAN. The armoured cars frequently patrolled the roads to deter guerrilla raids and escorted local convoys. South Africa equipped the SWATF with a single regiment of Eland-90s and Eland-60s at its inception in 1980, drawing their crews from local national servicemen. The regiment rarely operated as a cohesive unit. Rather, its squadrons were attached on a rotating basis to a variety of modular infantry battalions. In concert with the supporting infantrymen, Eland crews carried out search and destroy operations, manned road patrols and road checkpoints, and guarded static installations.

In August 1987, the SADF launched &quot;Operation Moduler&quot; to turn back a major FAPLA offensive in southern Angola, sparking the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. During &quot;Moduler&quot;, the SWATF&#x27;s 201 Battalion was ordered to deploy as far north as Ongiva and prevent Angolan units from re-occupying that settlement. For the purposes of this operation they were provided with an oversized squadron of Eland-90s. Most of the infantrymen were armed with a combination of anti-tank rifle grenades and RPG-7s in the event they needed to support the Elands against FAPLA tanks. Due to a shortage of troop-carrying vehicles, some were transported riding atop the armoured cars. They took up concealed positions on the road between Ongiva and Xangongo, and on October 5 a large FAPLA motorised contingent was sighted approaching the settlement, consisting primarily of truck-mounted infantry and a few BTR-60 and BTR-40 armoured personnel carriers. The advance was being screened by a reconnaissance troop of BRDM-2s, which blundered into the killzone and were engaged by the Eland-90s. While taking evasive action, one of the BRDMs drove off the road and collided with an Eland, causing momentary confusion. Most of the FAPLA column was destroyed in the ensuing firefight. Following this incident, FAPLA began deploying the more heavily armed BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles for convoy support purposes in areas where it was likely to encounter South African armour.

The ambush on October 5 is not mentioned in official Soviet or FAPLA communiques. However, an Angolan state bulletin dated September 13 alludes to an unspecified attack by SADF or SWATF troops specifically involving Eland-90s and Eland-60s. It is unclear whether this is a reference to the same action, as FAPLA claimed the South African unit responsible was 32 Battalion, which was not deployed near Ongiva at the time and only equipped with Ratel-90s. According to the bulletin, four Elands were destroyed during that engagement. Soviet sources reference at least three Eland-90s knocked out during &quot;Operation Moduler&quot; and &quot;Operation Hooper&quot;. The first was observed by a road near the Chambinga river crossing on 17 November 1987, and had apparently suffered a catastrophic kill as a result of being impacted by a BM-21 rocket. The other two were reported as destroyed by FAPLA&#x27;s 59 Brigade on 2 December 1987. These could only have been SWATF vehicles, as the Eland was no longer being actively used by the SADF; nevertheless, they do not appear among the losses acknowledged as a result of &quot;Moduler&quot; and &quot;Hooper&quot;.

SWATF Elands were mobilised again as part of &quot;Operation Hilti&quot; to counter a division of Cuban troops massing near the South West African border in mid 1988. The Cuban forces were believed to possess a brigade-sized formation of T-55 and T-62 tanks, which the SWATF would find difficult to deter with its outnumbered and obsolete Eland fleet. On 24 June, the SWATF and SADF retreated south after clashing with the Cuban tanks advancing on Cuamato, just north of the border. The following day, twelve Eland-90s were deployed to Cuamato to help 201 Battalion stop the tanks. However, the anticipated Cuban attack did not materialise, and the armoured cars were subsequently withdrawn without incident. Three were detached to safeguard the hydroelectric dam at Calueque, while the others returned to South West Africa. One was destroyed in an air strike by Cuban Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23s just outside Calueque on 27 June.

===Rhodesia===
Rhodesia waged a long and bitter counter-insurgency campaign against two rival insurgent armies, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), from 1965 to 1980. From the beginning of the war, the Rhodesian Air Force was perturbed by the likelihood of insurgent saboteurs disrupting fuel depots, forward airfields, and other installations vital to its operational capabilities. In 1971, the Rhodesian Air Force Security Training Unit (STU) was established for base security duties. The STU was trained and equipped by the South African government, which provided it with radios, small arms and ammunition, and basic weapons instruction. Requests for new equipment were made through a liaison officer attached to the Rhodesian Special Branch, who overheard an airman demand, perhaps in jest, &quot;a dozen armoured cars please&quot; when he asked the STU if there was anything else he could procure for them. This was interpreted and approved as an official request, and by the end of year twelve Eland-60s had been delivered by rail to the STU. The deployment of these armoured cars subsequently became an integral part of the unit&#x27;s doctrine.

The Elands gave much-needed mobility to STU personnel and allowed them to take part in responding quickly to insurgent raids, particularly one well-planned ZANLA assault on Grand Reef Air Base in 1978. They were dug into fixed revetments while on static guard duty, but also carried out routine patrols before each aircraft landed. At one point, it was standard practice at New Sarum for at least one Eland-60 crew to circle the airfield and check for suspicious activity or any other irregularities before an aircraft landed. During an insurgent raid, the Eland-60s would emerge from their revetments and intercept the attackers, providing much-needed fire support and firing illumination rounds to pinpoint insurgents for the dismounted security personnel.

The first STU Eland crews underwent a twelve-week training programme in Bloemfontein with the South African Armoured Corps, but subsequent intakes were trained locally. The armoured cars were all initially deployed in a single squadron at New Sarum Air Base, where their crews were mockingly referred to as “Desert Rats”, in reference to a popular nickname for British tank crews serving with the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa during World War II. The STU later embraced this mascot and adopted “Desert Mice” as an informal callsign for the Eland-60 squadron. Its motto, “Seek and Squeak”, parodied the “Seek and Strike” maxim of the RhAF&#x27;s No. 4 Squadron.

The Rhodesian Armoured Car Regiment (RhACR), originally formed as part of the British Empire&#x27;s war effort in 1941, was reactivated in 1972 and equipped with Ferret scout cars. However, the Ferrets were in delipidated condition, having been inherited by Rhodesia from the British Forces Aden after seeing several years of hard use in the Aden Emergency. The Ferret design also lacked the firepower to be truly effective against hardened ground targets and dug-in insurgents, being armed with just a single general-purpose machine gun. Following a failed project to increase the Ferret&#x27;s firepower by the addition of a 20mm autocannon, the Rhodesian government turned to South Africa, which offered to supply RhACR with Eland-90s. The first sixteen Eland-90s were delivered to the regiment in 1975. More Eland-90s were successively donated or loaned to the RhACR until 1979, and the earlier Eland Mk5s replaced by Mk6s. Estimates of the total number of Eland-90s in service with the Rhodesian Army by late 1979 range from 30 to 60. Eventually, four composite Eland-90 and Ferret squadrons were formed: A, B, and C squadrons were strictly reserve formations, while D squadron was a regular unit. The reserve squadrons were attached to the &quot;independent companies&quot; of the Rhodesia Regiment on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, and were the first to be mobilised for cross-border raids on the insurgents&#x27; external base camps in neighbouring Mozambique.

For the most part, the RhACR Eland-90s were utilised in the internal security and convoy escort role. The armoured cars were deployed at army roadblocks and frequently patrolled the borders to deter insurgent infiltrators. In the event of a conventional conflict, the Eland-90s were to be used in their secondary role of conventional reconnaissance vehicles. Their light armour protection was always a concern for the Rhodesian crews, particularly after trials proved that the Eland&#x27;s hull could be penetrated by armour-piercing 7.62×39mm rounds. Problems with the clutches were also encountered, which led to all the RhACR&#x27;s Elands being retrofitted with new clutches adopted from the army&#x27;s Land Rover utility vehicles.

All the Elands supplied to Rhodesia were fitted with number plates registered to the South African Police, which had a presence on Rhodesia&#x27;s northern border. This measure was initiated to maintain some form of deniability and keep South Africa&#x27;s role in arming the Rhodesian Security Forces covert. However, the Rhodesians abandoned the façade after the last South African police officers were recalled from that country in 1976. Another South African condition made unenforceable by the departure of the police was that the Elands were not to be deployed outside Rhodesia; after 1976 this was routinely ignored and the vehicles were used in external operations as needed. During Operation Miracle in 1979, Rhodesian Eland-90s spearheaded an assault on &quot;Monte Cassino&quot;, a heavily fortified ZANLA complex at New Chimoio, Mozambique. The Mozambicans responded by counterattacking with a T-54 tank company, supported by mechanised infantry in BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers. The Rhodesian forces managed to disperse the tanks with artillery and air strikes without committing their armoured cars.

===Zimbabwe===
As Rhodesian hopes for an eminent victory in the bush war quickly faded in the wake of Operation Miracle, the government acceded to a constitutional conference, mediated by the United Kingdom, with the senior insurgent leadership. The conference concluded after forty-seven plenary sessions with agreements on a phased political transition, a constitutional conference including the insurgent factions, and a ceasefire on 15 December 1979. Recognising that its Rhodesian allies were politically moribund, the South African government began withdrawing its support. It also demanded the return of the Eland armoured cars and hundreds of FN MAG machine guns supplied to Rhodesia on ostensibly permanent loan. A senior general officer in the Rhodesian Army was appointed to make the necessary arrangements. Just prior to the country&#x27;s 1980 elections, the STU Eland-60s were driven directly across the border. Most of the RhACR Eland-90s were loaded onto tank transporters and trucked back to South Africa as well. However, this process had not yet been completed when the political transition period ended and Rhodesia obtained internationally recognised sovereignty as Zimbabwe, under a new regime dominated by the former insurgent leadership. The repatriation of the armoured cars was abruptly terminated, leaving a handful of Eland-90s in the possession of the fledgling Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA). The number of Elands inherited by the ZNA is disputed, with some sources citing sixteen and others twenty-eight.

The SADF had no desire to leave the Eland-90s in the hands of a potentially hostile regime, and was implicated in a plot to destroy the armoured cars. SADF intelligence operatives sabotaged the fuel tanks of the Eland-90s and a number of other vehicles parked at King George VI Barracks in Harare with timed explosive devices in December 1980. The explosives were discovered when two detonated prematurely after becoming saturated by petrol. ZNA engineers disarmed and removed the remaining devices, albeit with some difficulty, as the Elands&#x27; turrets had to be removed to access their fuel tanks.

Zimbabwe was ravaged by inter-factional clashes between ex-ZANLA and ZIPRA militants between 1980 and 1981. Being relatively neutral in the dispute, the former Rhodesian Armoured Car Regiment was seen as a prime candidate for restoring order. In January 1981, a troop of four Eland-90s manned by national serviceman and led by Sergeant &quot;Skippy&quot; Devine was dispatched to keep the peace in Bulawayo, where rival ZANLA and ZIPRA units were encamped pending their integration into the national army&#x27;s 13th infantry battalion. The following month, the ZIPRA troops across Bulawayo revolted in what became known as the 1981 Entumbane uprising. On February 8, the armoured cars charged the mutineers&#x27; camp at Glenville and overran it with little resistance. Three days later, ZIPRA reinforcements in the form of a motorized column led by BTR-152 armoured vehicles and possibly including T-34-85 tanks was spotted approaching Bulawayo. Devine was ordered to intercept and destroy them. The Eland-90s promptly identified and knocked out a BTR at an outlying intersection. Taking up positions on the high ground overlooking Selborne Avenue, they stayed in place until two more BTRs attacked, firing indiscriminately with DShK machine guns. Both were destroyed by 90mm shells at two hundred metres. Devine&#x27;s Eland-90s knocked out a fourth BTR mere hours later. The ZIPRA tanks were later found abandoned near the road; none were in fighting condition. Devine was awarded the Bronze Cross of Zimbabwe for his actions at Entumbane.

After 1980, the former Rhodesian Armoured Car Regiment, now part of the Zimbabwe Armoured Corps, was reduced to a single regular squadron of Eland-90s. The Zimbabwean Ministry of Defence wanted to bring the regiment up to its pre-1980 strength of four squadrons, one to complement each of the ZNA&#x27;s four infantry brigades. From 1984 onwards, the Eland-90 was largely superseded in front-line service by the heavier, six-wheeled EE-9 Cascavel, which was adopted in sufficient numbers to form the three additional armoured car squadrons. A proposal to retrofit the ZNA Elands with upgraded 90mm guns and turrets was discussed but never reached fruition. In Zimbabwean service, the armoured cars suffered from a dwindling supply of spare parts and erratic maintenance. Some were still in service as late as the Second Congo War, during which most of the remaining Elands were believed to have been destroyed or otherwise lost to attrition.

===Western Sahara War===
Prior to the outbreak of the Western Sahara War, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) received relatively little modern armament, particularly from non-Francophone states. Meanwhile, the Polisario Front, intent on waging an armed struggle for Sahrawi independence, had stockpiled weapons from Algeria and seized additional equipment during raids on Moroccan forces. The hardware attrition rate spiralled upwards after the Madrid Accords and it quickly became apparent that new suppliers were needed to fill the bulk of FAR&#x27;s needs. A gradual arms buildup in the Sahara began in 1976. Financial assistance from Saudi Arabia allowed Rabat to tap a broad supply network: weaponry was obtained as far abroad as Iran, West Germany, and Belgium. Orders for Panhard AML-90s were placed with France; although some did arrive in second-hand condition, Panhard had long closed its production line and referred Morocco to South Africa. The first Eland Mk6s were imported in 1976. Others appeared with Ratels in the FAR after 1978. They were accompanied by eight South African instructors for training Moroccan crews, though other personnel were expressly forbidden to approach them.

Morocco grew more concerned with each successive FAR setback, and in September 1979 General Ahmed Dlimi adopted a new strategy of consolidating the forces spread out across Western Sahara. Individual garrisons were mustered into tactical groups for massed search and destroy operations against Polisario guerrillas menacing Dakhla, Zag, and Tarfaya. FAR&#x27;s Elands were first sighted during &quot;Operation Imam&quot;, one such attempt to break the encirclement of Zag. The Moroccan crews proceeded through a narrow valley against the counsel of their South African instructors, who correctly suspected a Polisario ambush. A large guerrilla force was able to trap and cut off the column of armoured cars in the valley. Over 30 Elands were captured during the failed offensive and some were destroyed. Domestic markings had been censored prior to export, but the vehicles were identified by an Afrikaans inscription on their intact fill caps. Eland-90s remained a notable feature in El Aaiún&#x27;s anniversary parades for several years to come.

===Other conflicts===
South Africa supplied 40 Elands of unknown designation to the Ugandan People&#x27;s Defence Force in the mid-1990s, along with Buffel mine-protected troop carriers. The armoured cars likely entered service during the Second Congo War, and may have seen action with Ugandan armour at Kisangani. They were later deployed against the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army. Local media also published reports that Nelson Mandela&#x27;s administration offered Elands to Pascal Lissouba before his loyalists were defeated by Angolan invaders in the Republic of the Congo Civil War. These claims could not be independently verified. Another source maintains that the original Congo order was placed in 1994 and only one was delivered.

At least 100 Eland-90s and 20 Eland-60s were emptied from SANDF surplus in 1999 and handed to a Belgian defence contractor (Sabiex) for resale. In September 2006, it emerged that President Idriss Déby of Chad was negotiating their purchase. The first 40 were delivered via France on March 3, 2007, and soon blooded in the fighting against a rebel faction encroaching on Adré. While Belgium reported the 1999 deal to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, it neglected to offer any details regarding Chad. Sabiex could neither confirm nor deny the sale to Amnesty International. The Wallonia Directorate for Arms Licences merely recalled authorising export to a buyer in France, without any restrictions as to further sales or transfers. Chad has since used its Elands on routine patrols near the Sudanese border, and against Islamic radicals in northern Mali.

Because the Eland is regarded as a cheap alternative to improvised technicals in areas where climate, terrain, and lack of support infrastructure or technical skill forestall the operation of large heavy armour forces, it has remained popular with sub-Saharan armies and insurgent groups.

==Description==
Eland hulls are constructed of a welded homogenous steel that provides moderate protection against grenade fragments, antipersonnel mines, and light weapons. The driver is seated at the front of the vehicle and is provided with a one-piece hatch cover that swings to the right. He has a total of three integral periscopes, which may be replaced by passive infrared or night vision equipment for driving in darkness. The turret is in the centre of the hull, where two other crew members are alternatively seated by variant. The rear power plant is completely enclosed in the hull with air intake and exhaust openings safeguarded through a ballistic grille conceding unrestricted air passage.

An Eland&#x27;s gearbox has one reverse and six forward gears. It is crosswise, coupled to both sides of the bevel pinion. Drive is transmitted from the gearbox to two lateral transfer boxes via pinions to the rear wheels and drive shafts that follow the hull to the front wheels. The shafts have extra universal joints beneath the turret. Each shaft drives a second cam type differential which bar either of the two wheel pairs from exerting a speed radically different from the other. In this respect Elands are less likely to experience transmission fouls and tyre wear than other armoured cars with a single central differential. The Panhard electric clutch, a major stumbling block for inexperienced drivers, has been replaced by a more concurrent hydraulic system for easier maintenance and reduced crew training time.

Also noteworthy is the independent suspension consisting of coil springs and hydropneumatic shock absorbers on trailing arms in the wheel mechanism; South Africa later adopted this design for the Rooikat. All four wheels are of the split rim type and fitted with Dunlop 12.00x20 tyres. There are two hydraulic braking systems, one for the front and one for the rear.

===External===
A squat, four wheeled, vehicle, the Eland slopes downwards at the front and less prominently at the rear. There are large semicircular wheel arches, which are obscured by storage bins adjacent to each rear wheel. Sand channels are stowed across the front of the hull, with headlamps located on either side of the towing shackle, beneath the channels. There are three periscopes over the driver&#x27;s position. Turrets are shallow and rounded, with sloping sides and a prominent sighting periscope to the right. There is a domed cupola over the commander&#x27;s hatch.

==Variants==
===Eland-60===
Modelled after Panhard&#x27;s AML HE-60-7, the &quot;Eland-60&quot; was the first Eland variant to enter service. It is armed with twin 7.62mm machine guns on the left and a single 60mm mortar on the right. Unlike its French predecessor, only one machine gun is mounted coaxially in the turret. A second was typically carried on a pintle for anti-aircraft use. The mortar has an elevation of +75° and a depression of -11°. A single type of mortar is available: the Hotckiss-Brandt CM60A1, produced under licence as the Model K1. It can be fired on a flat trajectory and is effective up to 300 metres in the direct role, or 1,700 metres in the indirect role. No more than 56 rounds of 60mm and 3,800 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition are carried. South African crews usually stored 44 mortar bombs per vehicle.

Eland-60s have a rounded turret with a large, dual-piece, hatch cover opening front and rear.

===Eland-90===
Modelled after Panhard&#x27;s AML H-90, the &quot;Eland-90&quot; functioned as a fire support platform and assault gun. In this role it was easy to underestimate. During combat against tanks, its biggest edge was superior mobility, although this was diminished somewhat by the lack of a stabilised cannon. The armoured cars were often decisively outranged by the Angolan tanks, and their inability to fire on the move resulted in a poor rate of engagement. Eland-90s are equipped with a Denel GT-2 90mm gun; a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun is also mounted to the left of the main armament. The GT-2 has an elevation of +15° and a depression of -8°. Turret rotation is manual and takes approximately twenty seconds. A gunner is seated on the right and has a one-piece hatch cover. The loader or commander is on the left of the gun and a single hatch cover provided for the commander. Total ammunition capacity is 29 rounds of 90mm and 2,400 rounds of 7.62mm.

When needed, Eland-90s could accommodate two ENTAC or SS.11 missiles, both of which slide out of external rails to be launched.

===Eland-20===
The &quot;Eland-20&quot; was a base Ratel&#x27;s turret atop the Eland chassis. It is fitted with a 7.62mm machine gun and 20mm GI-2 (M963 F2) autocannon offering an elevation of +38° and a depression of -8°. The 20mm cannon has a cyclic rate of fire of 750 rounds per minute. If required, another 7.62mm machine gun can be mounted on the turret roof.

Destined for export, Eland-20s were marketed primarily to Morocco. At least 18 of Ireland&#x27;s AMLs were also upgraded to this standard by South Africa and redesignated &quot;AML H-20&quot;.

===Other variants===
In 1994, an Eland was showcased with a turbocharged diesel four-cylinder powerpack developing 103 hp at 4,000 rpm. This was mounted on a sliding frame to facilitate easier engine removal and maintenance. Apart from the new engine, other changes were made to enhance performance in tropical climates. These included modified air conditioning and cooling systems. Reumech OMC—then a subsidiary of Vickers—marketed the design as &quot;Eland Mk7 Diesel Turbocharged&quot;, or simply &quot;Eland Mk7 DT&quot;. An estimated 200 Mk7s were haggled from the SANDF for diesel conversion.

Mechanology Design Bureau, another South African firm, has proposed removing the Eland-90&#x27;s turret altogether and replacing it with a giant cupola. This relieves ground pressure considerably, allowing for the installation of a specialised electronic reconnaissance suite. A similar upgrade was proposed for the Eland-60, although the latter retains its original turret.

Several foreign companies currently offer extensive rebuild or overhaul programmes for the Eland, particularly with regards to improving engine performance and reliability. Saymar, an Israeli firm, has proposed a modified Eland with a two-litre Toyota diesel engine developing 76 kW (102 hp). Another upgrade programme is being marketed by Belgium&#x27;s Sabiex International, which includes the complete refurbishment of the vehicle&#x27;s transmission, electrical system, and drive train.

Various demonstrators have been built at the SANDF School of Armour utilising an Eland drive train, suspension, or chassis. Examples include an armoured personnel carrier resembling the Panhard M3 and an 8X8 Rooikat prototype.

==Armament and ammunition==
The modular design of Eland weapon systems allowed Sandock-Austral to update or downgrade armament with ease according to prospective clients&#x27; wishes. Ranging is manual and Eland-90s assisted by a non-stabilised optical fire control system.

Like the AML, the Eland is equipped with a two-person turret. The original Eland-60 had an unusual combination of the 60mm K1 mortar and two medium, or one heavy, machine guns - a combination inspired by French experiences in the Algerian War. The mortar weighs 75 kg and is 1.8 metres long. Maximum effective range of the K1 as produced by Denel Land Systems is stated to be 1,700 metres. An Eland-60 was always present in every South African support troop due to the effectiveness of its illumination bombs during night operations.

It was the SAAC which first recommended an AML with heavier armament: they were then looking for a fire support platform to complement the Alvis Saracen. Due to parts compatibility the Alvis Saladin was an obvious initial choice. Nevertheless, the AML licence had already been purchased, so there were obvious advantages in filling the same role with an existing vehicle. Panhard&#x27;s response was the AML H-90.

The 90mm Denel GT-2 gun, which fires fin-stabilised high-explosive (HE) and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectiles, is heavier than that mounted in the Saladin and provides the Eland with a very potent form of armament, considering its small size and speed. It weighs 380 kg and has a double baffle muzzle brake. With the muzzle brake, it measures 4.1 metres in length. Low-angled rifling is used in the barrel. The breech of the gun is semi-automatic and fitted with a vertical sliding wedge breech block. The firing mechanism utilises a mechanical firing pin which was prone to sticking and malfunction in dusty climates. There is also a recoil control mechanism consisting of a single cylinder with a constant stress spring and a hydropneumatic recuperator designed to return the GT-2 to its original firing position. This process entailed releasing oil into a nitrogen reservoir as the gun recoiled upon firing. Oil levels and the nitrogen pressure had to be monitored frequently; if neither was sufficient turret crews were forced to physically manhandle their gun back into position. During the 1970s, the recoil systems in all the Eland-90s were modified to allow the gun to be fired in all directions from the fully traversing turret without the risk of knocking the extremely lightweight armoured car over. In theory, these modifications also permitted the gun to be fired while the vehicle was in forward motion, although crews were prohibited from doing so due to the likelihood of transmission damage.

South Africa began producing its own 90mm ammunition in large quantities after French high-explosive rounds were blamed for causing stoppages in Eland-90s during Operation Reindeer.

Maximum effective range of the Denel GT-2 is stated to be 2,200 metres (HE). The HEAT-T round will penetrate 320mm of armour at a zero angle of incidence or 150mm of armour at a 60° angle of incidence. A locally manufactured fin-stabilised, shaped charged, projectile was also under development in 1976. The complete round weighs 7 kg of which the projectile itself weighs 3.65 kg. The complete round is 654mm in length with the projectile being 500mm in length. This round has an m/v of 750 m/s and a maximum velocity of 760 m/s, and effective range is given as 1,200 metres.

==Doctrine==
The Eland&#x27;s first combat deployment to the Caprivi Strip revealed major flaws in South African armour doctrine. Firstly, the SAAC learned that significant swathes of Namibian (and Angolan) terrain were not ideal conditions for military vehicles. Caprivi had thick bush which restricted movement, turret traverse, and visibility. It also confounded textbook formations. Second, Eland crews were trained on the arid flats of Bloemfontein and Walvis Bay. The conditions they encountered were quite unlike anything the SADF had prepared them for.

Much was learned from Elands&#x27; performance in &quot;Operation Savannah&quot;. Their ability to move so swiftly over tar and packed gravel surprised FAPLA on multiple occasions. They were also rather silent; a quiet petrol engine enabled stealth during ambush or evasive manoeuvres. Furthermore, the Eland-90 proved that it was powerful enough to defeat the heaviest armour ranged against it, the Soviet T-34. &quot;Savannah&quot; was the SAAC&#x27;s first experience of mobile warfare in the Angolan bush, creating a laboratory where new tactics could be tested.

According to the South African Military College at Voortrekkerhoogte, which clearly recognised the Eland&#x27;s weakness in attrition warfare, SADF doctrine was to be &quot;based on not to hold ground but to create the design of battle in such a way that you would lure the enemy into killing ground and then [with] the superiority of fire and movement, you would kill him completely.&quot; Factors such as rapid movement, striking from the flank, surprise and confusing the enemy with continuous manoeuvring thus became integral components in the new SAAC. That Voortrekkerhoogte was worried about the Eland&#x27;s light construction was apparent. It subsequently issued a requirement for a &quot;heavy armoured car&quot; and grafted support infantry into the existing squadrons to deal with the threat posed by RPGs. Due to lack of space in an Eland to accommodate support troops, infantry mobility vehicles were called for. The SADF experimented with Land Rovers, Bedford RLs, and Unimog trucks before United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 further limited their choices. There were logistical incentives for adopting the Panhard M3, which shared many interchangeable parts with the Elands, but this notion was rejected: Pretoria wanted a true MRAP. After dozens of trials and modifications the Buffel was finally born.

Eland squadrons operated on the troop (platoon) level in operational areas: one was assigned to virtually every major settlement (i.e. Rucana, Ondangwa, Eenhana, Katima Mulilo, etc.). There were four Elands in a troop - Bravo Car, Alpha Car, Charlie Car, and Delta Car. Alpha and Charlie were the troop sergeant and leader respectively. Bravo was always an Eland-60. Delta was the additional option: either a second Eland-60 or a support infantry Buffel. This provided an excellent mix of direct and indirect fire to troop commanders. Bravo could release illumination bombs for night attacks or create a smokescreen. Charlie and Alpha laid down suppressive fire. If present Delta infantry debussed and attacked on foot from the nine o&#x27;clock position. Communication in the troop was essential, as fire had to be lifted once Delta moved to target.

The armoured car troop was expected to operate independently. Its own crews carried out repair and recovery with limited resources. Operations were dictated by the amount of fuel, ammunition, water and ration that could be carried per vehicle. The Eland&#x27;s easy maintenance allowed them to operate on makeshift repairs in the field for up to seven days, hunting SWAPO cadres by day and forming open laagers by night.

One of the first major breakthroughs of the late 1970s was the development of the Ratel. Three years after Springfield-Bussing built the first prototype in 1974, Magnus Malan reported to Parliament that the Ratel was &quot;successfully industrialised&quot;. Ratels replaced Buffels in support troops and by 1982 all armoured car regiments had been retrained to depend on mechanised infantry during conventional operations. A second watershed came when twelve junior officers and senior noncoms underwent training as tank commanders in the Israeli Defense Forces, which had amassed considerable experience with mobile mechanised warfare. Officers who attended courses at the IDF combat school included the later commanders of 61 Mechanised, including Gert van Zyl and Ep van Lill. The acquired expertise in armour tactics was implemented in SAAC curricula and manuals, replacing the archaic British doctrine of World War II. Commands became more concise, emphasis shifted to reaction speed, and evaluation methods improved substantially. Nevertheless, the SAAC defeated the purpose of Israeli tank drills by applying them directly to armoured cars, setting a trend that continued throughout the border war.

Throughout the 1980s, Elands played a supporting role for the Ratel-mounted mechanised combat groups. Specific infantry battalions such as 61 Mechanised also held generic platoons of Eland-90s or Ratel-90s as an antitank reserve. The latter was preferred, as Elands experienced difficulty observing other forces in thick bush. Spotting tanks was a particular problem. Their crews had an even chance of noticing FAPLA T-54/55s, which also had low profiles. This poor visibility in vegetation also complicated command and control, frustrating both driver and troop leader to no end.

For decades, Elands were widely deployed in lieu of tanks in the SAAC. The main danger with this policy was that crews and commanders were often forced to use them against Angolan or Cuban tanks. Whenever T-55s appeared on the battlefield, they caused anxious moments for the Eland-90. The tanks carried stabilised cannon, so they could fire on the move, whereas the Eland-90 needed to come to a stop before discharging its main gun. Firing the 90mm GT-2 while in forward motion was theoretically possible but disrupted the recoil procedure and risked catastrophic damage to the vehicle&#x27;s transmission. Their inferior armament and optics meant that Elands had to close in on a tank to eliminate it, which demanded considerable skill. Where possible gunners aimed for the rear, flank, or a vulnerable margin beneath the turret front. Naturally the tank would also turn to avoid exposing its thinner armour, so expert manoeuvring was required before they could get behind a T-55 and destroy it from there.

Eland-90 troops always identified one tank as a priority target. Then, when the chance came, the Elands fired simultaneously—knocking out the tank. To avoid being hit between volleys, they had to keep moving. This protocol was derived from SADF experience fighting T-34s and later applied to T-55s. Armoured car commanders believed it wouldn&#x27;t have fared well against T-62s. Eland-90s struggled in big, dense, bushes while attempting to carry out their usual tactic during &quot;Operation Askari&quot; and were hereafter deemed unfit for high intensity campaigns.

==Survivors==

South Africa formally retired its Eland fleet in 1994. However, at least one reserve armoured unit continued to operate Elands as late as 1996. Of the 1,268 still accounted for in 1991, only 235 remained in reserve storage by 1998. A statistic released by the Department of Defence in 1997 confirmed that Elands valued in excess of 41.3 million rand had been scrapped. In October 2005, all the SANDF&#x27;s remaining Elands were offered for sale. Tenders for Eland-90s were still available in 2009.

In January 2005, two Elands at the South African National Museum of Military History were repossessed and impounded by the SANDF. The seizure of the vehicles was justified on the grounds that they had been marked off for disposal from the army&#x27;s inventory some time prior, but SANDF officials had no record of their transfer to the museum. Why both Elands were being exhibited at the museum without the SANDF&#x27;s apparent knowledge remains a mystery. The disputed Elands were eventually acquired by Denel, which had them overhauled at its own expense and returned to the museum in July 2015.

Both the South African Armour Museum in Bloemfontein and Sandstone Estates in Ficksburg have preserved at least one Eland-90 and Eland-60 apiece. Others survive on SANDF bases as gate guardians. Four armoured units are known to have retained individual Eland-90s for ceremonial purposes: 1 Special Service Battalion, the Umvoti Mounted Rifles, Regiment Mooirivier, and Regiment Oranjerivier. These vehicles participate in parades, public exhibitions, and fire gun salutes during special occasions, such as the anniversary of the South African Armoured Corps. Turretless Elands modified with ring-mounted handrails are still used for transporting SANDF dignitaries on parade grounds during official inspections.

An Eland-90 was sold at a private auction in Portola Valley, United States, on July 11–12, 2014. Another Eland-60 was sold to the Jordanian government by an unidentified supplier in the United Kingdom the following year, for exhibition at the Royal Tank Museum in Aqaba. Other foreign museums known to possess Elands in their collections include the Gweru Military Museum in Zimbabwe and the Sahrawi People&#x27;s Liberation Army Museum in Algeria.

For several decades, an Eland-90 captured by FAPLA during Operation Savannah was publicly displayed in a square near the centre of Luanda. This vehicle has undergone at least one restoration and now resides at the Angolan Museum of the Armed Forces.

==In popular culture==
Eland-90s painted with UNITA markings make an appearance in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;, during a fictitious engagement of Operation Alpha Centauri. A number of the armoured cars are knocked out by FAPLA T-62 tanks outside Jamba in the protagonist&#x27;s first mission, &quot;Pyrrhic Victory&quot;.

Eland armoured cars feature prominently in the Larry Bond novel &quot;Vortex&quot;, which depicts a hypothetical SADF invasion of newly independent Namibia during the early 1990s. The Elands are pressed into front-line service to complement the Rooikat in the reconnaissance and fire support role, as the SADF was equipped with relatively few of the newer armoured cars during the novel&#x27;s time frame.

A mercenary unit surreptitiously acquires several mothballed Eland-90s from the SANDF&#x27;s reserve stores with the connivance of two corrupt South African armour officers in &quot;The Liberators&quot;, by Tom Kratman. The armoured cars are subsequently used to destroy several T-55 tanks in a coup d&#x27;état attempt.

<doc id="651922" wikidata="Q445405" url="?curid=651922" title="Darius Rucker">
<text>Darius Carlos Rucker (born May 13, 1966) is an American singer, musician, and songwriter. He first gained fame as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of rock band Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, which he founded in 1986 at the University of South Carolina along with Mark Bryan, Jim &quot;Soni&quot; Sonefeld, and Dean Felber. The band released five studio albums with Rucker as a member and charted six top 40 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Rucker co-wrote most of the songs with the other members of the band.

His debut studio album, an R&amp;B record titled &quot;Back to Then&quot; (2002) was released through Hidden Beach Recordings. Six years later, Rucker signed to Capitol Nashville as a country singer and released his second album, &quot;Learn to Live&quot; (2008). Its first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I Don&#x27;t Think About It&quot;, peaked at number one on Hot Country Songs chart, making it the first song by a Black artist to do so since Charley Pride in 1983. It was followed by three similarly successful singles: &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Like This for Long&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot;, and &quot;History in the Making&quot;.

In 2009, he became the first Black American to win the New Artist Award from the Country Music Association, and the second Black person to win any award from the association. His third album, &quot;Charleston, SC 1966&quot;, was released on October 12, 2010. The album included the number one country singles, &quot;Come Back Song&quot; and &quot;This&quot;. His fourth album, &quot;True Believers&quot; (2013), reached number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and spawned the singles &quot;True Believers&quot;, &quot;Wagon Wheel&quot;, and &quot;Radio&quot;. His first country Christmas album, &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (2014) reached number 31 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. His sixth album, &quot;Southern Style&quot; (2014) reached number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, supported by the singles &quot;Homegrown Honey&quot; and &quot;Southern Style&quot;. His seventh and eighth studio albums, &quot;When Was the Last Time&quot; (2017) and &quot;Carolyn&#x27;s Boy&quot; (2023) followed thereafter.

==Early life==
Rucker was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina. His single mother, Carolyn, a nurse at Medical University of South Carolina, raised him with his three sisters and two brothers. According to Rucker, his father was never around, and Rucker saw him only before church on Sundays. His father was in a gospel band called The Traveling Echoes. Rucker has said that he had a typical Southern African-American upbringing. His family attended church every Sunday and was economically poor; at one point, his mother, her two sisters, his grandmother and 14 children were all living in a three-bedroom house. But he says that he looks back on his childhood with very fond memories. His sister, L&#x27;Corine, recalled that singing was always his dream.

==Hootie &amp; the Blowfish==
Darius Rucker has been the lead singer of Hootie &amp; the Blowfish since its formation in 1986. He met fellow band members Mark Bryan, Jim &quot;Soni&quot; Sonefeld, and Dean Felber while attending the University of South Carolina. Bryan first heard Rucker singing in the shower, and the two became a duo, playing R.E.M. covers at a local venue. They later recruited Felber and finally Sonefeld joined in 1989. As a member of Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Rucker has recorded seven studio albums: &quot;Cracked Rear View&quot; (1994), &quot;Fairweather Johnson&quot; (1996), &quot;Musical Chairs&quot; (1998), &quot;Scattered, Smothered and Covered&quot; (2000), &quot;Hootie &amp; the Blowfish&quot; (2003), &quot;Looking for Lucky&quot; (2005) and &quot;Imperfect Circle&quot; (2019), also charting within the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 six times. All six albums feature songs that Rucker, Bryan, Felber, and Sonefeld wrote. As the frontman, Rucker began to be called simply &quot;Hootie&quot; by fans, though the band title combines the nicknames of his college friends. Before his rise to fame, he lived in the basement of the Sigma Phi Epsilon house at the University of South Carolina, attempting to launch his career through the college bar scene.

Rucker&#x27;s signature contribution to the band is his baritone voice, which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has called &quot;ingratiating,&quot; &quot;TIME&quot; has called &quot;low, gruff, [and] charismatic,&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; has characterized as a &quot;barrelhouse growl.&quot; Rucker said they &quot;flipped&quot; the formula of the all black band with a white frontman, like Frank Sinatra performing with Count Basie. Musically, he has sometimes been criticized or spoofed for not being &quot;black enough&quot;. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ran a sketch of Tim Meadows playing Rucker leading beer-drinking, white fraternity members in a counter-march to Louis Farrakhan&#x27;s Million Man March. He also received death threats for singing the Hootie song &quot;Drowning,&quot; a protest song against the flying of the Confederate flag above the South Carolina statehouse.

Shortly after gaining a measure of fame, Felber and Rucker (who consider themselves best friends) moved into an apartment in Columbia, South Carolina. With Rucker&#x27;s recognition as the frontman of a successful band came increased opportunities. In October 1995, he was asked to sing the national anthem at the World Series. Frank Sinatra invited him to sing at his 80th birthday party; he sang &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp.&quot; That same week, he made a voice cameo in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. He also joined Nanci Griffith on the song &quot;Gulf Coast Highway&quot; for her 1997 album &quot;Blue Roses from the Moons&quot;, and sang backing vocals on Radney Foster&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;See What You Want to See&quot;. He encouraged Atlantic Records to agree to a deal with Edwin McCain and made a guest appearance on McCain&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot;.

In regard to the future of Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Rucker was quoted by CBS news as stating in late 2011, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever break up totally. We&#x27;re Hootie &amp; the Blowfish. ... We&#x27;ll make another record and do another tour someday. I don&#x27;t know when, but it will happen. There&#x27;s one more in us.&quot; After a ten-year hiatus, Rucker and the band announced that they would be touring with Barenaked Ladies in 2019 while also releasing a new album that same year.

Their sixth studio album &quot;Imperfect Circle&quot; was released on November 1, 2019.

==Solo career==

In 2001, he made his solo R&amp;B debut album, &quot;The Return of Mongo Slade,&quot; for Atlantic Records. Because of contractual changes, it was never released by the label. Hidden Beach Recordings, an independent label, acquired the masters from Atlantic and released the album as &quot;Back to Then&quot; in July 2002. The album included work from the production team of Jill Scott, and she made an appearance on the track &quot;Sometimes I Wonder.&quot; The single &quot;This Is My World&quot; was featured in the 2001 comedy film &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;. In regards to the album, &quot;That was just a minute in my life,&quot; he later told &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; about the record. &quot;I was listening to a lot of Notorious B.I.G. and Lauryn Hill at that time, and I wanted to make a neo soul record.&quot; He also said in the article that he doesn&#x27;t anticipate recording an R&amp;B-styled disc again. &quot;Country music is my day job now. I&#x27;ll probably do this till it&#x27;s all over, but that album was a lot of fun.&quot;

Rucker appeared on a pop-star edition of the quiz show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; in July 2001. He also portrayed a singing cowboy in a television commercial for the fast-food company Burger King, promoting its TenderCrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch sandwich in 2005. In the commercial, he sang a jingle set to the tune of &quot;The Big Rock Candy Mountains&quot;. In 2006 Rucker lent his voice to the track &quot;God&#x27;s Reasons&quot; written by Dean Dinning and Joel A. Miller for the film &quot;The Still Life&quot;.

===Country music===
====2008–2009: &quot;Learn to Live&quot;====
In early 2008, Rucker signed to Capitol Records Nashville as the beginning of a career in country music. His first solo single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I Don&#x27;t Think About It&quot; (which he co-wrote with Clay Mills) debuted at No. 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts for the week of May 3, 2008. It is the first single from his second album, &quot;Learn to Live&quot;. For this album, Rucker worked with Frank Rogers, a record producer who has also produced for Brad Paisley and Trace Adkins. Rucker also made his Grand Ole Opry debut in July 2008. The single reached number one in September, making Rucker the first solo, African-American artist to chart a number one country hit since Charley Pride&#x27;s &quot;Night Games&quot; in 1983.
&quot;Learn to Live&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 6, 2009, and received a platinum certification on August 7, 2009. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Like This for Long&quot;, spent three weeks at the top of the country chart in mid-2009. Its follow-up, &quot;Alright&quot;, became Rucker&#x27;s third straight No. 1 hit, making him the first singer to have his first three country singles reach No. 1 since Wynonna in 1992. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;History in the Making&quot; was released in September and peaked at No. 3. The singles also crossed over to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at 35, 36, 30 and 61.
&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine said that &quot;there&#x27;s a sense of purpose that makes Rucker feel like a member of the country family, rather than calculating interloper.&quot; Rucker made visits to various country stations around the United States, explaining that he was aware that he was the &quot;new kid on the block.&quot; Mike Culotta, the program director of Tampa, Florida, radio station WQYK-FM expected that Rucker would be &quot;somebody who would have entitlement,&quot; but instead said that &quot;Darius engaged everybody.&quot; When Rucker found that &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I Don&#x27;t Think About It&quot; went to number one, he cried. On November 11, 2009, Rucker won the Country Music Association New Artist of the Year award (formerly known as the Horizon Award), making him the first African American to do so since the award was introduced in 1981. Only one other African American has won at the CMAs: Charley Pride, who won entertainer of the year in 1971 and male vocalist in 1971 and 1972.

====2010–2011: &quot;Charleston, SC 1966&quot;====
Rucker released his second country album, &quot;Charleston, SC 1966&quot;, on October 12, 2010. The title is inspired by Radney Foster&#x27;s solo debut album, &quot;Del Rio, TX 1959.&quot; Its first single was &quot;Come Back Song,&quot; which Rucker wrote with Chris Stapleton and Casey Beathard. It was his fourth country number one as well as a NO. 37 hit on the Hot 100. The album&#x27;s second single was &quot;This&quot;, which was released to radio in November 2010 and also reached No. 1 in the country chart. Rucker wrote it with Rogers and Kara DioGuardi. &quot;I Got Nothin&#x27;&quot; was the album&#x27;s third single, peaking at No. 18. Also included on the album is a duet with Brad Paisley titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;. &quot;Charleston, SC 1966&quot; received a gold certification.

====2012–2014: &quot;True Believers&quot;====
On May 20, 2011, Rucker delivered the commencement address to the graduating class of the Medical University of South Carolina.

On December 14, 2011, CBSnews.com reported that Rucker was working on a third country album with recording set to begin January 2012 followed by the release of the album early in the year. The album&#x27;s lead-off single, &quot;True Believers,&quot; made its chart debut in September. On October 12, 2012, Rucker told Broadway&#x27;s Electric Barnyard that his album would also be titled &quot;True Believers&quot;. &quot;True Believers&quot; peaked at No. 18.

The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Miss You&quot;, was released to country radio on February 3, 2014.

On October 2, 2012, Rucker was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry. Halfway through his set at the Opry that night he answered questions from the audience which included a question from Brad Paisley. Paisley said: &quot;I have two questions. One, are you still the worst poker player in the world? And two, would you like to become the newest member of the Grand Ole Opry?&quot; Rucker accepted, and it became official on October 16.

Rucker was a featured performer at the C2C: Country to Country festival in London on March 17, 2013, which was headlined by Carrie Underwood.

On January 6, 2016, Rucker announced that he was working on his fifth country album. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;If I Told You&quot;, was released to country radio on July 5, 2016. It reached number one in the Country Airplay chart nearly a year later, and peaked at number four on the Hot Country Chart.

==Golf==
On November 7, 2016, Rucker told ESPN that he had become a partner in MGC Sports, a sports agency that currently represents golfers (among them Steve Stricker and Kenny Perry), football players, and coaches. He added that he was planning to reduce his performance commitments from 100 dates per year to about 30, and that he thought his experience in the entertainment business would be an asset to potential clients. Rucker will be able to work without restrictions for golfers, but because he is not registered with the NFL players&#x27; union, he initially will only be able to meet with NFL players under very limited circumstances.

Rucker has hosted the Darius Rucker Intercollegiate at Long Cove Club in Hilton Head since 2012. The three-day tournament annually hosts some of the top women&#x27;s intercollegiate golf teams in the country.

==Personal life==
Rucker is an ardent South Carolina Gamecocks fan as well as a Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Reds fan.

Rucker&#x27;s mother died in November 1992 of a heart attack. His grief inspired two Hootie &amp; the Blowfish songs: &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Home&quot; and &quot;Not Even the Trees.&quot; On April 21, 1995, his girlfriend, Elizabeth Ann Phillips, gave birth to Rucker&#x27;s first child, a daughter, Carolyn Pearl Phillips. Rucker married Beth Leonard in 2000. Their first child, daughter Daniela Rose, was born on May 16, 2001, and their son, Jack, on October 27, 2004. The Hootie song &quot;Where Were You&quot; is about Rucker&#x27;s strained relationship with his father, and was released only in Europe, where Rucker thought that his father would be unlikely to hear it. His country single &quot;Alright&quot; was inspired by his marriage. Rucker and his wife announced their divorce in 2020.

Rucker is a friend of golfer Tiger Woods, whom he met in a bar in 1993 when Woods was 18. Rucker sang at the golfer&#x27;s wedding with Hootie &amp; the Blowfish and at his father&#x27;s funeral. His interest in golf goes well beyond his relationship with Woods; he was a VIP guest of Team USA at the 2016 Ryder Cup, and he attended Arnold Palmer&#x27;s funeral shortly before the Cup.

For the &quot;Undercover Boss&quot; series episode &quot;Celebrity Undercover Boss: Darius Rucker&quot;, which premiered May 12, 2017, Rucker disguised himself as a 62-year-old music teacher, ran an open mic night and worked as a roadie.

On February 1, 2024, Rucker was arrested in Williamson County, Tennessee on two misdemeanor drug charges and one misdemeanor vehicle registration violation. He was released after posting $10,500 bail. In a statement given to &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, Rucker&#x27;s lawyer Mark Puryear claimed that Rucker was &quot;fully cooperating with authorities related to the misdemeanor charges.&quot;

Rucker released &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short: A Memoir&quot; () in 2024.

On January 29, 2025, Rucker revealed in an Instagram post that he would be relocating to London, England, to tour more frequently around the United Kingdom, and work on new creative endeavors. He has no plans to renounce his U.S. citizenship.

== Philanthropy and impact ==
Rucker has regularly worked with charities that support sick and underprivileged children, via benefit concerts, volunteering, the World Golf Foundation&#x27;s The First Tee Program, and the Hootie &amp; The Blowfish Foundation which has raised nearly $4.5 million to provide funding to public education systems throughout South Carolina.

He serves as a board member of the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children&#x27;s Hospital in Charleston, where his mother worked for over thirty years from the time Rucker was a child, and has helped raise millions of dollars to help build a new hospital.

He also made a commitment to support St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital after touring the facility in 2008. Since then, Rucker has spearheaded an annual event resulting in over $1.6 million raised for St. Jude&#x27;s to date.

<doc id="651924" wikidata="Q462650" url="?curid=651924" title="A Touch of Frost">
<text>A Touch of Frost is a British television detective mystery drama series starring David Jason produced by Yorkshire Television (later ITV Studios) for ITV from 6 December 1992 until 5 April 2010, initially based on the Frost novels by R. D. Wingfield. Writing credit for the three episodes in the first 1992 series went to Richard Harris.

The series stars Jason as Detective Inspector William Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Frost, an experienced and dedicated detective who frequently clashes with his superiors. In his cases, Frost is usually assisted by a variety of detective sergeants or constables, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost&#x27;s interactions with the bureaucratically-minded Superintendent Norman &quot;Horn-rimmed Harry&quot; Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.

A number of young actors had their major debut as supporting cast in the show, including: Matt Bardock, Ben Daniels, Neil Stuke, Mark Letheren, Colin Buchanan, Jason Maza, Jim Sturgess, Damian Lewis and Marc Warren.

==Background==
The series is set in the fictional southern England town of Denton. Denton may be in Berkshire, Oxfordshire or Wiltshire. There are many references to Reading, Oxford, and Swindon. In SE1E1 a character mentions going to Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, implying it is a short journey away and thus in the Hertfordshire or Essex area. In SE2E3 a suspect talks about &quot;Driving over to Chelmsford&quot;, implying reasonable proximity to Denton, again placing the action in the Herts/Essex area. Frost drives a blue Ford Sierra – D843 MPP. This is a Luton registration (ending &#x27;PP&#x27;), a very common registration in Hertfordshire, consistent with Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. In the earlier episodes, the M4 and A417 were often seen, and the map of Swindon was seen in the control room, although a map of Reading was used occasionally. Paperwork given to Frost and other characters refers to Denton station as being part of the Thames Valley Police. In SE2E4 Frost hurries to Denton station and Network SouthEast branding is visible on the station signs. This is broadly consistent with most of the putative locations listed, though not with the actual Yorkshire locations. In SE4E1 Frost and Toolan observe a train passing, consisting of a British Rail Class 141 Pacer in West Yorkshire Metro red and cream livery coupled with a British Rail Class 142 Pacer in BR Provincial Sector blue livery. Both units in those liveries are quite inconsistent with Network SouthEast but very much with the Yorkshire locations. In some episodes ambiguous references to &#x27;County&#x27; are made. This is inconsistent with Denton being part of Thames Valley since this is not part of a County force. One reference implies &#x27;County&#x27; has jurisdiction beyond that of Denton. Either &#x27;County&#x27; is the HQ of the county force Denton belongs to, or Denton is a small city force, surrounded by a larger county force. A situation analogous to that of Oxford City Police and Oxfordshire Constabulary pre-1968.

Filming location names are sometimes used in lieu of a fictional address, one such example occurs in SE2E1 where Frost is made aware of, and later visits, an address of interest located at King George Gardens. The scene was filmed at King George Gardens, Chapel Allerton, Leeds. The Denton Police Station of early seasons was filmed in an industrial complex at the intersection of Burley Road and Westfield Road in Leeds; this has since been demolished. Seacroft Hospital in Leeds was used as the &#x27;Denton&#x27; Hospital.

The role of Frost was notable in changing the public perception of David Jason from a predominantly comic actor to a dramatic actor.

At a press conference in London on 15 September 2008, David Jason announced that he would be quitting the role of DI Jack Frost. Jason&#x27;s main reason for quitting the role was that Frost was by now the oldest detective on television and he felt that it was &#x27;natural&#x27; to retire as Frost. At 68, a police detective would already have been retired for eight years. Sir David said: &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t want me to play Frost in a wheelchair, would you?... Frost is getting a little long in the tooth. I still enjoy doing it and it&#x27;s a great part but I just think he&#x27;s got to retire. It&#x27;ll be a sad day.&quot;

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* DI William Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Frost (David Jason, 1992–2010) is a cynical and mercurial detective, whose talents are offset by human failings which include drinking other people&#x27;s beverages, a scruffy fashion sense, and leaving his home, office, and car in states of disarray. This is marginally different from how he is portrayed in the novels, where he often lacks sympathy and has a stern, intimidating, almost vitriolic tone. He is frequently shown to avoid paperwork, leaving his subordinates to finish it. He never uses a police notebook to record evidence and other information, instead scribbling notes on various bits of paper which he stuffs in his coat pockets. Frost is widowed in the first episode. He had planned to abandon his wife, but, just as he was going to tell her, he was advised that she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. After hearing this news, he drank heavily and deliberately angered an armed man, who shot him. As a result of subduing the man in what was perceived as a courageous, heroic act, Frost was awarded the highest British civilian award for gallantry, the George Cross, but which he describes in Episode 1 as anything but heroic. Whenever he is reminded of his award, he tends to suffer embarrassment and guilt. He is respected and admired by his colleagues and is shown to be a well-meaning but flawed man as acknowledged by troubled youth, the elderly and even by some criminals he has previously arrested. On several occasions, as in the novels, Frost breaks the law and plants evidence to get an arrest or conducts searches without permission (often gaining entry with one of his large bunch of keys, which, of course, is impossible, as he would need hundreds, and selecting the right one first time, equally unlikely) although he always has the correct suspect, as well as helping sympathetic villains or misdemeanours, often to get out of the paperwork. This type of behaviour regularly saw Frost suspended, disciplined or threatened with the same throughout the series. In the first novel, his name is shown to be Jack Frost, when DC Barnard finds his George Cross in a drawer and the inscription reads &quot;To Jack Edward Frost&quot;. It was felt by the producers that the name Jack Frost was implausible for the TV series, so Frost was given William as his real first name, or &quot;Billy&quot; as his wife called him, with Jack becoming a nickname. Also in the novels, he was a chain-smoker; this again was altered in the series to have Frost quit smoking in the first episode and occasionally struggle with stopping the habit over the subsequent two series, with a penchant for unhealthy foods taking its place.
* Superintendent Norman Mullett (Bruce Alexander, 1992–2010), a social climber concerned with appearances and ambitious for promotion, is Frost&#x27;s boss and his constant foil on the job. Mullett has a love-hate relationship with Frost, whose detective skills he admires but whose people and political skills he abhors. The long-suffering Mullett frequently threatens to sack Frost, but Frost&#x27;s ability to close cases usually saves him. In addition, receiving the George Cross made Frost &quot;the Chief Constable&#x27;s blue-eyed boy&quot;, thus protecting Frost from being sacked or retired by Mullett. His background in the novels was extensive; highly educated and a qualified solicitor, Mullett always drove a prestige car and was married in the series to Elspeth, who was occasionally seen, and was assured promotion to Chief Superintendent once the new police station was completed. Eventually, this promotion is turned down in a later episode thanks to yet another crisis caused by Frost who, surprisingly, gets off lightly. Frost&#x27;s nickname for Mullett is &quot;Horn-rimmed Harry&quot; due to the traditional design of his spectacles. Frost also has a plastic, mounted grey mullet hanging on his office wall; a grey mullet is a fish commonly found in British coastal waters but not usually eaten as it is considered bland. Frost constantly tries to avoid Mullett but, just as he thinks he has managed to avoid him, Mullett spots him and generally calls out, &quot;Ah, Jack&quot; to which Frost replies, &quot;Ah, there you are, sir&quot;. His first name was given in the novel &quot;Hard Frost&quot; as Stanley, but this novel was not written until a couple of years after the name Norman was given to the character by the writers of the TV series. In the final episode, Mr. Mullett appears to be wearing a blazer with the badge of the Army Intelligence Corps. However, in episode SE3E1, Mullett is shown wearing a blazer with an unidentified British military &#x27;bullion&#x27; badge (but not that of the Army Intelligence Corps).

===Supervising Officers===
* DCI Jim Allen (Neil Phillips, 1992–1994), the first DCI to feature in the series. He and Frost get on well, sharing jokes about Mullett and concern for each other&#x27;s emotions on harrowing cases. They only argue when Frost is taken off a serial rape case. He is mentioned in the second episode of the third series as &quot;being away&quot;, but is never seen again.
* DCI Charlie Hawkes (Matthew Marsh, 1995), temporarily replaced DCI Allen. Popular with his subordinates, Hawkes&#x27; tenure is marked by his mishandling of the death of a young girl. Hawkes viciously obtains a confession from a local male with Down&#x27;s Syndrome, but Frost finds the actual killer. Hawkes also inadvertently allows an imposter to pose as a visiting CID officer too. 
* DCI Jim Peters (Nigel Harrison, 1996–1997), replaces temporary DCI Charlie Hawkes. He is more laid-back and humorous than Allen and appears to have a good relationship with Frost. He is the last DCI featured in the series, with Frost taking over the position in all but name for the rest of the show.
* DSI Bailey (Gwyneth Strong, 1997), is a Discipline &amp; Complaints officer who suspends Frost, believing he&#x27;s part of an evidence tampering conspiracy led by former superior Charlie Fairclough. Frost, innocent of the charge, persuades Fairclough to confess. Despite her clashes with Frost and Mullett during the case, Frost admits she is a good and effective officer. 
* Chief Superintendent Babcock (Michael Cochrane, 2002) is a senior officer within Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary, reviewing Denton CID. Babcock strongly dislikes Frost, aiming to ensure his dismissal. After Frost stops a serial killer and numerous other crimes, Babcock is unable to get his wish.

===Detective Sergeants===
* George Toolan (John Lyons, 1992–2010), Jack&#x27;s long-time friend and colleague with whom he shares an office. George is about the same age as Jack but a rank lower. Though he is more cautious, George is steadfastly loyal to Frost. Originally DCI Allen&#x27;s assistant, he is later partnered with Frost on many occasions. In the first novel his name was George Martin, but as &#x27;Toolan&#x27; he was retained for the series. He is known to have a wife, Mary, who confronts Frost after George is injured by falling from a flight of stairs. He was one of only three characters who stayed with the show until its demise and was the only permanent cast member to be killed off in the show&#x27;s history. His death plays a role in Frost&#x27;s decision to retire, as he no longer sees the office as a safe haven to escape his outside troubles without George there.
* Hazel Wallace (Caroline Harker, 1992–2003) is a young, happy-go-lucky uniformed officer. In the first novel, she was originally named Hazel Page and did not appear in any subsequent books, replaced in succession by other female officers, but was retained in the series for continuity. In the first episode she starts a relationship with DC Clive Barnard, but this quickly fizzles out when he is transferred away from Denton. Upon his temporary return, Barnard attempts to rekindle their romance, but she is in another relationship. At the end of the same series, she moves to CID. Though she ceased to be a regular, she continued to make guest appearances in later series and was promoted to detective sergeant. She also gave birth to a daughter whom she brought into the station on one occasion. In the second series she almost fell victim to a serial rapist but overpowered him in her apartment.
* Clive Barnard (Matt Bardock, 1992; 1995–1997) was the nephew of the Chief Constable and newly promoted into CID when he first meets Frost. Most people believe he has only got into CID through his family connections, but Frost sees beyond that and takes Barnard under his wing. Whilst Barnard is transferred away from Frost after only a brief tenure, the two still work together occasionally on cases over the following years. Later promoted to DS, Barnard is shot dead in the line of duty, saving Frost&#x27;s life. Frost, saying Clive is the real hero, places his George Cross on Clive&#x27;s body to be buried with him. He appeared in the first novel and was carried across onto the series for continuity.
* Sandy Gilmore (Tony Haygarth, 1992) is a chain-smoking copper of the 80s, who is seconded to Denton CID to cover the number of officers on sick leave. Although he inappropriately tries to smoke in the houses of people he is interviewing and gets a reprimand, Frost begins to like his instinctive, proactive sense of policing.
* Maureen Lawson (Sally Dexter, 1994; 2003) is a strong-willed, hardworking gay detective who sometimes lets her personal judgement get in the way. She left divisional CID after a burglary victim was stabbed by her jealous lover, though she was saved from further repercussions by Frost&#x27;s protection. She later returned to help Frost investigate the murder of a local businessman.
* Frank Nash (Neil Stuke, 1996) is a young, hardworking officer who, after a move to Denton from London, is trying to settle down with his wife and start a family. However, the long hours that Frost makes him work begin to strain his marriage, so he and his wife decide to up sticks and move back to London. Frost tipped Frank for good success and wished him all the best.
* Rab Prentice (Russell Hunter, 1996) is an old-fashioned, laidback Scottish detective due for retirement. His constant bemoaning of sex and relationships, and repeated remarks to Frost about old age, easily rile the inspector. To Frost&#x27;s shock, Prentice applies for the &quot;ill health pension&quot; at the end of the episode (citing &quot;stress&quot;) in order to retire early and embark on a relaxed lifestyle.
* Liz Maud (Susannah Doyle, 1997) is an ambitious, high-flying detective who transferred to Denton from the West End. Whilst investigating child abuse, Maud inadvertently risks Frost&#x27;s career when a report she files implies Frost went easy on a murder suspect. After finding the real killers, Maud returns to London when Mullett refuses her application to become an Acting DI. 
* Billy &quot;Razor&quot; Sharpe (Philip Jackson, 1999; 2005) is nicknamed &quot;Razor&quot; because he&#x27;s not very sharp. However, Frost rates him because he&#x27;s a &quot;plodder&quot; who is methodical in his work. After once working with Frost, Sharpe returns to support him during an investigation into a serial killer, having previously worked on a similar case. Here, Sharpe is stabbed but non-fatally by the killer. 
* Bill Dorridge (Paul Jesson, 1999–2000) was assigned by newly promoted Assistant Commissioner Cremond to temporarily replace DS George Toolan, who was temporarily reassigned to &quot;community duties&quot; due to disciplinary action. Dorridge is an amiable, by-the-book detective with experience in most investigative sections, especially liking commercial fraud.
* Terry Reid (Robert Glenister, 2001–2003) is a tough London detective who has suffered from alcohol and drug addictions. He has often been in trouble for his extreme methods, though he has mellowed by the time he works with Frost. Working together on several cases, Frost and Reid become friends. Frost also learns about an act of bravery by Reid, for which he was awarded the Military Medal.
* Annie Marsh (Cherie Lunghi, 2008) is a hardworking detective from Manchester who is not keen on Frost&#x27;s methods of cutting corners and bending the rules to get a result. Once, before she and Frost were posted at Denton, she reported him for endangering the life of a young PC and being unprofessional – something he took to heart and still remembers to this day.

===Detective Constables===
* Vic Webster (George Anton, 1992) is briefly Frost&#x27;s partner. When PC Shelby, a confident uniformed officer with a reputation as a ladies&#x27; man, is murdered, Frost investigates and finds Webster killed him because Shelby had been having an affair with his wife. Webster denies the charges, but Frost is ultimately successful in finding evidence to prove his case, resulting in Webster being sentenced for his crime.
* Carl Tanner (Lennie James, 1994) is a black officer seconded to support Frost with investigations into a murder and burglaries within a black majority area of Denton. Appointed by Mullett purely for public relations, Tanner nonetheless proves himself as an able, dedicated officer. However, despite their newly formed working relationship, Tanner is reassigned again by Mullett following the conclusion of the cases.
* Martin Costello (Neil Dudgeon, 1994) is an unpopular officer with a negative perception of him when he becomes Frost&#x27;s partner. This is due to Costello being reassigned to Denton CID after punching a DCI in his former unit. Moody, sullen and cynical, it&#x27;s only when Frost issues a stern warning about Costello&#x27;s conduct that he lightens up and shows Frost exactly why he&#x27;s a good officer.
* Giles (Sarah Kirkman, 2003) is an officer protecting trial witness Cathy Thompson, as Cathy awaits to testify against gangland villain Jack Flynn. When one of Flynn&#x27;s hitmen attempts to murder Cathy, Giles scares the hitman off. However, because her colleague DC Chandler had taken an unauthorised trip to the shop at the same time, Giles and Chandler are suspended and told bluntly their careers are over. 
* Chandler (Robert Horwell, 2003) is an officer protecting trial witness Cathy Thompson. Chandler&#x27;s negligence results in Flynn&#x27;s hitman nearly murdering Cathy, prompting Cathy to flee with her son Robbie. Alongside his partner Giles, Chandler is suspended and bluntly told his police career is as good as obliterated.

===Uniformed officers===
* PC Ernie Trigg (Arthur White, 1994–2010), the police archivist. He helps Frost with knowledge of known associates and crime methods he has collected over the years that are not available in the police computer system. He and Frost knew each other long before they were stationed at Denton. 
* Sgt Alan Hadley (Sean Blowers, 2003) is a senior firearms officer overseeing a manhunt for gangland hitman Gary Tinley. Whilst chasing Tinley, Hadley&#x27;s partner PC Kenny Russell is killed, supposedly by Tinley. However, Frost and Reid discover Hadley actually murdered Russell and framed Tinley as revenge for Russell having an affair with his wife Sheila. Before being arrested, Hadley commits suicide out of guilt. 
* WPC Claire Toms (Colette Brown, 1996) serves as Frost&#x27;s partner when recovering a kidnap victim held to ransom. With training in kidnap recovery and hostage negotiation, Toms proves to be a useful and capable partner despite her youth and junior rank. After the successful conclusion of the operation, Toms returns to other duties.
* PC Craven (Ian Mercer, 1996), a patrol officer Frost encounters a few times during investigations. When Frost is rendered homeless after a house fire and moves into the shared accommodation block for police officers, Craven is one of his flatmates. Craven is perturbed to find food from the shared kitchen going missing, unaware that Frost himself is the culprit. 
* WPC Lindsey Hunter (Katrina Levon, 1996) is temporarily seconded into CID to support Frost&#x27;s investigation of an assault on a student at Denton University. After the case is solved and the culprit apprehended, Hunter returns to uniform, earning Frost&#x27;s respect and gratitude for her competent conduct during the investigation.
* WPC Holland (Miranda Pleasence, 1997–1999) attracts Frost&#x27;s ire during an investigation into an elderly woman murdering her husband. Frost, sympathetic to the elderly woman&#x27;s plight given the long-term abuse she suffered from her husband, chastises Holland&#x27;s callous attitude. Holland is also romantically involved with DS Barnard and is devastated by his death in the line of duty.
* WPC Ronnie Lonnegan (Michelle Joseph, 2002) is temporarily assigned to CID to support Frost when Denton station is under inspection. A black female officer who is recently widowed, Lonnegan dismisses a series of early gaffes from Frost, and the two work well together whilst hunting a serial killer stalking Denton. After the killer is caught, Lonnegan returns to her former duties.
* WPC Tracy Miller (Daniele Lydon, 2003) is assigned to protect Cathy Thompson and her son Robbie, as Cathy is a key witness in a major murder trial against gangland criminal Jack Flynn. Miller is shot and badly wounded by Flynn&#x27;s hitman, resulting in her losing an arm. The brutal crime drives Frost on to catch Flynn and those responsible, as Miller was a recruit of his. 
* PC Kenny Russell (Stuart Bowman, 2003) is an armed response officer, working on the manhunt for Gary Tinley, a gangland hitman. Russell is shot and killed, supposedly by Tinley. However, Frost and Reid discover Russell&#x27;s partner, Alan Hadley, killed Russell as he&#x27;d been having an affair with his wife, Sheila.

===Other Service Personnel===
* Sandy Longford (Bill Stewart, 1992-1999), Denton Evening News journalist who has a longstanding love–hate relationship with Frost, since each party is often either useful or a nuisance to the other. Longford regularly pesters Frost for confidential details of ongoing cases to report on, although Frost often uses Longford&#x27;s local knowledge and contacts to help solves cases.
* Captain Carlisle (Ralph Brown, 1996), a member of the Royal Military Police and Special Investigation Branch forced to partner with Frost during an investigation into the murder of a Territorial Army volunteer. Whilst Frost and Carlisle initially clash, they eventually work together to solve the murder and uncover other crimes, including the illegal selling of weapons and blackmail. 
* Eileen Cleary (Helen Masters, 2003) is a solicitor with the CPS assigned to the trial of gangland villain Jack Flynn. Cleary strikes up a rapport with key witness Cathy Thompson, but Terry Reid views Cleary negatively after previous experiences. After repeated attempts by Flynn&#x27;s men to murder Cathy, Frost deduces Cleary as Flynn&#x27;s informant. Upon being arrested, Cleary reveals Flynn is the father of her son, which informs her betrayal. 
* Martine Phillips (Sara Stewart, 2005), is a criminal profiler assigned to help Denton CID investigate the brutal murder of a mother. Phillips establishes they&#x27;re dealing with a serial killer seeking sexual gratification and is threatened by the killer during the case. DS Sharpe develops a crush on her, but Phillips rejects any kind of romantic or sexual attention from him before leaving. 
* Christine Moorhead (Phyllis Logan, 2010), an RSPCA officer who works with Jack to help crack his final case, involving dog fighting. She later becomes a key witness in a murder, and the couple becomes closer. Jack finds himself bonding with her teenage children and, as such, the pair decide to marry. However, on their wedding day, her ex-husband, in a drunken fit of jealousy, tries to kill Jack by ploughing into the side of his car in his 4x4. However, he misses, instead killing DS George Toolan. It is on the strength of his relationship with Christine that Jack decides to retire, now that he has something outside the station to live for.

===Romantic Interests===
* Shirley Fisher (Lindy Whiteford, 1992–2000), the nurse who cared for Jack&#x27;s terminally ill wife. She later develops a relationship with Jack, which continues for some time. The relationship is strained when Shirley realises she can&#x27;t cope with the demands of Jack&#x27;s job and how he frequently stands her up on important occasions. The pair separate, although Jack on several occasions seems to regret their parting.
* Rosalie Martin (Isla Blair, 1996–1997) is a widow who encounters Frost when he investigates the murder of a gigolo whom Rosalie had been seeing. A spark develops, and Rosalie promises to contact him when she&#x27;s ready to move on romantically. She does so a year later, leading her and Frost to begin a relationship. However, this is brief and ends when Rosalie confesses she has feelings for another man. 
* Kitty Rayford (Gwyneth Powell, 1997), an ex-prostitute whom Jack knew in her youth. She and Jack meet again in &quot;Penny for the Guy&quot; when he crashes into her car after skipping a temporary red light. The pair maintain a physical relationship until they go their separate ways in &quot;True Confessions&quot; as Frost realises he cannot give Kitty the ongoing companionship she desperately desires.
* Dr. Pam Hartley (Susan Penhaligon, 2002) is a criminal profiler who Jack meets at a training course. Frost seeks Pam&#x27;s advice about a suspected serial killer and the two also begin a relationship. However, the killer kidnaps Pam because she had previously recommended he be taken into care as a child. Frost saves Pam from being murdered, but sometime later, off-screen, they break up.

==Episodes==
==Production==
The series is based on the novels of R. D. Wingfield:
* &quot;Frost at Christmas&quot; (1984)
* &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; (1987)
* &quot;Night Frost&quot; (1992)
* &quot;Hard Frost&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Winter Frost&quot; (1999)
* &quot;A Killing Frost&quot; (2008)

By discarding several minor sub-plots in &quot;Frost at Christmas&quot;, the two major cases were able to be investigated in the one episode, being the pilot &quot;Care and Protection&quot;. This novel, and the pilot, introduced the characters of Frost, Mullet, DI Allen (DCI in the series), DS George Martin (Toolan in the series), Sgt. Bill Wells, Sgt. Johnny Johnson, DS Arthur Hanlon (uniform sergeant in the series), DC Barnard, PC Jordan, PC Simms, WPC Hazel Page (Wallace in the series), PC Stringer, newspaper reporter Sandy Lane (Longford in the series), Dr McKenzie, pathologist Drysdale (Simpkins in the series), his assistant Miss Grey and Shirley, Frost&#x27;s on/off love interest.

Due to their length, many of the other books were split into multiple episodes. &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; was split over three episodes. &quot;Night Frost&quot; was split over two (although the element of DS Gilmore&#x27;s marriage break-up was used in the series 4 episode &quot;The Things We Do for Love&quot;, which has no other reference to &quot;Night Frost&quot;, for the series-only character of DS Nash). &quot;Hard Frost&quot; was the last and perhaps most closely referenced novel filmed, which was split across two almost unrelated episodes. Despite the show still being produced when the last two novels were written, they were never used as source material for episodes, possibly due to their more graphic subject matter.

The iconic saxophone solo heard during the show&#x27;s theme music was performed by Barbara Thompson.

The aspect ratios of &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; have been the subject of discussion. From series 1 through to 5, the series was originally shown and transferred to DVD in the 4:3 aspect ratio (which was still mostly the UK television norm in the 1990s). From series 6 onwards, the show was shown in a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio. The DVD releases reflected this change. However, from 2012, ITV3 HD have been broadcasting a growing number of episodes of the series in high definition, remastered from the original 16mm source. In these HD versions, even the opening series are shown in widescreen. Comparisons to the 4:3 version of the shows (still available on DVD) have shown that the frame has been &quot;opened-up&quot; to include previously unseen parts of the frame. This not only means that these episodes fit the widescreen ratio without cropping out important material, they are a new experience.

==Reception==
Reviewing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; at the series finale, Nancy Banks-Smith wrote, &quot;Tragedians can play tragedy, but comedians can play anything. David Jason, never cut out by nature to be a copper, has been exceptional as Frost. Well up there with Poirot, Morse and Columbo.&quot;

==International broadcast==
In Australia, the series aired on ABC, UK.TV and 7Two. In Canada, the series aired on Knowledge, SCN and TVOntario. In New Zealand, the series aired on Prime, TV1 and UK.TV. In the United States, the series aired on A&amp;E Network. In the Netherlands, the series aired on KRO, while in Italy on La7. Other countries that have aired the series include Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Japan, Norway and Sweden.

In Ireland the series originally aired on RTÉ, but was later dropped by RTÉ in the early 2000s and was not acquired by TV3 Ireland (which was then part owned by ITV, until 2006), however with the introduction of UTV Ireland in 2015 the series made a return and has aired across all Virgin Media channels (formerly TV3) since UTV Ireland&#x27;s takeover in 2017.

==DVD releases==
==Prequel series==
Free @ Last TV, who produced the Sky1/Acorn TV series &quot;Agatha Raisin&quot;, are developing a prequel series, based on the novel &quot;First Frost&quot;, published in 2011 by Transworld Publishers Ltd.

<text>Dromaeosaurus (; ) is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period (middle late Campanian and Maastrichtian), sometime between 80 and 69 million years ago, in Alberta, Canada and the western United States. The type species is Dromaeosaurus albertensis, which was described by William Diller Matthew and Barnum Brown in 1922. Its fossils were unearthed in the Hell Creek Formation, Horseshoe Canyon Formation and Dinosaur Park Formation. Teeth attributed to this genus have been found in the Prince Creek Formation. &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; is the type genus of both Dromaeosauridae and Dromaeosaurinae, which include many genera with similar characteristics to &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; such as possibly its closest relative &quot;Dakotaraptor&quot;. &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; was heavily built, more so than other dromaeosaurs that are similar in size, like &quot;Velociraptor&quot;.

==Discovery and naming==

Despite receiving widespread attention in popular books on dinosaurs, and the usage of a complete mounted skeleton cast in museums throughout the world, &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; is poorly known from actual fossils. The preparation of the popular cast by the Tyrrell Museum was only made possible by knowledge gained from other dromaeosaurids that have been discovered more recently.

The first known &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; remains were discovered by paleontologist Barnum Brown during a 1914 expedition to Red Deer River on behalf of the American Museum of Natural History. The area where these bones were collected is now part of Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada. The find, holotype AMNH 5356, consisted of a partial skull in length, a mandible, two hyoids, a first metacarpal and some foot bones. The skull lacked most of the top of the snout. Several other skull fragments, and about thirty isolated teeth, are known from subsequent discoveries in Alberta and Montana.

In 1922 William Diller Matthew and Brown named and described the type species of &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;: &quot;Dromaeosaurus albertensis&quot;. The generic name is derived from the Greek (&#x27;) meaning &#x27;runner&#x27; and (&#x27;) meaning &#x27;lizard&#x27;. The specific name, &quot;albertensis&quot;, refers to Alberta.

Another seven species of &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; were named: &quot;Dromaeosaurus laevifrons&quot; (Cope 1876) Matthew &amp; Brown 1922; &quot;Dromaeosaurus cristatus&quot; (Cope 1876) Matthew &amp; Brown 1922 (&quot;Troodon&quot;); &quot;Dromaeosaurus? gracilis&quot; (Marsh 1888) Matthew &amp; Brown 1922; &quot;Dromaeosaurus explanatus&quot; (Cope 1876) Kuhn 1939; &quot;Dromaeosaurus minutus&quot; (Marsh 1892) Russell 1972 (an alvarezsaurid); &quot;Dromaeosaurus falculus&quot; (Cope 1876) Olshevsky 1979 and &quot;Dromaeosaurus mongoliensis&quot; (Barsbold 1983) Paul 1988 (&quot;Adasaurus&quot;). Most of them were based on fragmentary material, some belonging to other genera, and far less complete than that of &quot;Dromaeosaurus albertensis&quot;, and those that haven&#x27;t been reclassified are considered &quot;nomina dubia&quot; today. Nevertheless, it has grown apparent that &quot;Dromaeosaurus albertensis&quot; is even rarer in its habitat than other small theropods, although it was the first dromaeosaurid of which reasonably good cranial material was described.
The genus &quot;Chirostenotes&quot; was considered to be synonymous with &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; at one point in time.

==Description==

&quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; was a medium-sized carnivore, about in length and in body mass. Its mouth was full of sharp teeth, and it probably would have had a sharply curved &quot;sickle claw&quot; on each foot. It lived during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. However, some fragmentary remains such as teeth that may belong to this genus have been found from the late Maastrichtian age Hell Creek and Lance Formations, dating to 66 million years ago. Teeth have also been found in the Aguja Formation.

&quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; had a relatively robust skull with a deep snout. Its teeth were rather large and were shaped like a curved cone with a coat of enamel covering the crown. It had only nine teeth in each maxilla. &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; also had a vein at the back of the head, the &quot;vena capitis dorsalis&quot;, that drained the front neck muscles through two long canals running to the posterior surface of the brain.
The Meckelian groove of Dromaeosaurus is rather shallow and does not have much depth.

==Classification==

Matthew and Brown originally placed &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; to its own subfamily, the Dromaeosaurinae, within the &quot;Deinodontidae&quot; (now known as Tyrannosauridae) based on some similarities in the general proportions of the skull. In 1969, John H. Ostrom recognized that &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; shared many features with &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and the newly discovered &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, and assigned these forms to a new family: Dromaeosauridae. Since then, many new relatives of &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; have been found.

The exact relationships of &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; are somewhat unclear. Although its rugged build gives it a primitive appearance, it was actually a very specialized animal. In an analysis of the clade Dromaeosaurinae, species such as &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, &quot;Achillobator&quot; and &quot;Yurgovuchia&quot; have been recovered. The genus &quot;Dakotaraptor&quot; has been classified as the sister taxon to &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;, but more recent analysis do not recover such a close relationship.

Below is a cladogram by Senter &quot;et al.&quot; in 2012. &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; is recovered as the sister taxon to &quot;Yurgovuchia&quot;, &quot;Utahraptor&quot; and &quot;Achillobator&quot;.

The cladogram below follows a 2015 analysis by paleontologists Robert DePalma, David Burnham, Larry Martin, Peter Larson, and Robert Bakker, using updated data from the Theropod Working Group. In this analysis, &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; is classified as the sister taxon of &quot;Dakotaraptor&quot;.

== Paleobiology ==
&quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; differs from most of its relatives in having a short, massive skull, a deep mandible, and robust teeth. The teeth tend to be more heavily worn than those of its relative &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot;, suggesting that its jaws were used for crushing and tearing rather than simply slicing through flesh. Therrien &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) estimated that &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; had a bite nearly three times as powerful as that of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and suggested it relied more on its jaws than on the sickle claw to kill its prey. In a study predominantly centered around &quot;Shuvuuia&quot;, &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; was compared to the former and also to &quot;Alioramus&quot;, in which both &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; and &quot;Alioramus&quot; were discovered to be diurnal predators. 

=== Feeding behavior ===
&quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;&#x27; feeding habits were also discovered to be typical of coelurosaurian theropods, with a characteristic &quot;puncture and pull&quot; feeding method. Studies of wear patterns on the teeth of this animal by Angelica Torices &quot;et al.&quot; in a study regarding theropod feeding habits indicate that dromaeosaurid teeth share similar wear patterns to those seen in the Tyrannosauridae and Troodontidae, respectively. However, micro-wear on the teeth indicated that &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; likely preferred larger prey items than the troodontids it shared their environment with. Such differentiations in its diet likely allowed the theropod to inhabit the same environment as its more distant maniraptoran relatives. The same study also indicated that both &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; and &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot; (also analyzed in the study) likely included bone in their diet and were better adapted to handle the stresses associated with attacking struggling prey while troodontids, equipped with weaker jaws, preyed on softer animals and prey items such as invertebrates and carrion. This feeding strategy and ability to handle struggling prey was also a feature that the theropod also shared with tyrannosaurids such as &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, which was also analyzed in said study alongside these smaller theropods.

<text>John Clifford Pemberton (August 10, 1814 – July 13, 1881) was a United States Army officer who fought in the Seminole Wars and with distinction during the Mexican–American War. He resigned his commission to serve as a Confederate lieutenant-general during the American Civil War. He led the Army of Mississippi from December 1862 to July 1863 and was the commanding officer during the Confederate surrender at the Siege of Vicksburg.

==Early life and career==
Pemberton was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second child of John and Rebecca Clifford Pemberton. His ancestor, Phineas Pemberton, traveled to the Colony of Pennsylvania from Lancashire, England 
, along with William Penn in 1682. John entered the United States Military Academy in 1833 and was a roommate and close friend of George G. Meade. He graduated in 1837, standing 27th in his class out of 50 cadets. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment on July 1, 1837. He participated with the 4th during the U.S. Army actions against the Seminole Indian tribe during the Second Seminole War in 1837 and 1838, fighting in Florida at the Battle of Loxahatchee on January 24, 1838.

Pemberton and the 4th Artillery served in garrison duty at Fort Columbus, Governors Island, New York, from 1838 to 1839, and then at the Camp of Instruction located near Trenton, New Jersey, in 1839. He then served along the northern U.S. frontier during the brief Canadian Border Disturbances of the Aroostook War. Pemberton and the 4th were next stationed in Michigan, serving at Detroit in 1840, at Fort Mackinac in the upper Great Lakes in Michigan in 1840 and 1841, and at Fort Brady in 1841. He then served in Buffalo, New York, from 1841 to 1842, and was promoted to first lieutenant on March 19, 1842. Pemberton and the 4th returned to garrison duty at Fortress Monroe, in Hampton Roads harbor on coastal Virginia in 1842, then were stationed at the U.S. Army Cavalry School at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, in 1842 and 1843, and returned to Fort Monroe from 1844 to 1845.

From 1845 to 1846, Pemberton and the 4th Artillery were part of the U.S. military occupation of Texas before the admission of the Republic of Texas into the United States as the 28th state in 1845. Then the 4th was sent to Mexico at the start of the Mexican–American War the following year. He fought at the Battle of Palo Alto on May 8, 1846, and at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma the next day. He then fought well at the Battle of Monterrey in that fall and was appointed a brevet captain &quot;for Gallant Conduct in the several Conflicts at [Monterrey]&quot; on September 23.

Pemberton then fought in the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1847 actions in Mexico, including the Siege of Vera Cruz in March, the Battle of Cerro Gordo in April, the skirmish near Amazoque in May, the capture of San Antonio and the Battle of Churubusco in August, and most notably in the Battle of Molino del Rey that September. Pemberton was appointed a brevet major for his performance at Molino del Rey on September 8. He then was part of the storming of Chapultepec Castle on September 13, and the Battle for Mexico City that day and the next, where Pemberton was wounded. Pemberton held the position of Aide-de-Camp to Brevet Brigadier General William J. Worth from August 4, 1846, to May 1, 1849, and was a fellow staff lieutenant in the same division as his future opponent in the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant. He was an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847 – a military society founded by U.S. Army officers who served in Mexico City during the military occupation following the war.

===After Mexican-American War===
In 1848, Pemberton married Martha Thompson of Norfolk, Virginia.

After the war with Mexico, Pemberton and the 4th Artillery served in garrison duty at Fort Pickens near Pensacola, Florida, in 1849. He then fought in Florida during hostilities against the Seminoles in 1849 and 1850. The 4th returned to garrison duty at New Orleans Barracks in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1850, and Pemberton was promoted to captain on September 16. He next served in Fort Washington, Maryland, along the lower Potomac River below the capital in 1851 and 1852, at Fort Hamilton, New York, from 1852 to 1856. He and the 4th Artillery fought again in Florida during further hostilities against the Seminoles from 1856 to 1857.

Pemberton and the 4th were then on frontier duty at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 1857 to 1858, and participated in the Utah War in 1858. He was then stationed at Fort Kearny in the New Mexico Territory in 1859, at Fort Ridgely in Minnesota from 1859 to 1861. After returning from the West in April 1861, he passed through Baltimore during the infamous Baltimore riot of 1861 in command of a regiment in transit on April 18–19, 1861, en route to Fort McHenry. Later he was briefly on garrison duty at the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., in April 1861.

==American Civil War==
At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Pemberton resigned from his commission in the United States Army and joined the Confederate States Army, despite his birth in a free state and the fact that his two younger brothers both fought for the United States. He resigned his commission, effective April 29, despite pleas from his family and his former commander Winfield Scott. His decision was due to the influence of his Virginia-born wife and many years of service in the slave states before the war. He was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Army of the Confederate States of America (ACSA) on March 28, and was made assistant adjutant general of the forces around and in the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, on April 29, the date of his resignation from the U.S. Army. He was promoted to colonel on May 8. On May 9, Pemberton took a commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Artillery of the Provisional Army of Virginia. Upon the absorption of the Provisional Army of Virginia into the PACS, Pemberton was appointed a major of artillery, a line field commission, on June 15, 1861, and was quickly promoted to brigadier general two days later. His first brigade command was in the Department of Norfolk, Virginia, leading its 1st Brigade from June to November.

Pemberton was promoted to major general on January 14, 1862, and given command of the Confederate Department of South Carolina and Georgia, an assignment lasting from March 14 to August 29, with his headquarters in Charleston, South Carolina. As a result of Pemberton&#x27;s abrasive personality, his public statement that if he had to make a choice, he would abandon the area rather than risk the loss of his outnumbered army, and the distrust of his free-state birth, the governors of both states in his department petitioned President of the Confederate States of America Jefferson Davis for his removal. Davis needed a commander for a new department in Mississippi and also a command for Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, so he sent Pemberton west and assigned the more popular Beauregard to Charleston.

===Vicksburg===
On October 10, 1862, Pemberton was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, and assigned to defend the fortress city of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and the Mississippi River, known as the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. Davis gave him the following instructions regarding his new assignment: &quot;... consider the successful defense of those States as the first and chief object of your command.&quot; Pemberton arrived at his new headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi, on October 14.

His forces consisted of fewer than 50,000 men under the command of Maj. Gens. Earl Van Dorn and Sterling Price, with around 24,000 in the permanent garrisons at Vicksburg and Port Hudson, Louisiana. John D. Winters described the men under Pemberton as &quot;a beaten and demoralized army, fresh from the defeat at Corinth, Mississippi.&quot; Pemberton faced his former Mexican War colleague, the aggressive U.S. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and over 70,000 U.S. soldiers in the Vicksburg Campaign.

In an attempt to carry out his orders from both Davis and Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, Pemberton and his Army of Mississippi set out east to combine with Johnston&#x27;s forces gathering around Jackson while remaining in contact and covering Vicksburg. Another order from Johnston changing their proposed meeting location caused Pemberton to turn around. When he did, he accidentally collided with Grant&#x27;s army at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16 and suffered a significant defeat. Pemberton retreated to the Big Black River, where he fought and suffered even more heavy losses on May 17. Pemberton resolved to defend Vicksburg and led his defeated men back into its defenses on May 18. In the process, he gave up the high ground on Hayne&#x27;s Bluff, which Sherman had failed to take in December. Johnston had advised him that if this ground ever fell, Vicksburg would be untenable and that he should escape with his army of 31,000, sacrificing the city. Pemberton refused to take this advice. He held firm for over six weeks while soldiers and civilians were starved into submission. (Pemberton, well aware of his reputation as a Northerner by birth, was probably influenced by his fear of public condemnation as a traitor if he abandoned Vicksburg.)

On the evening of July 2, 1863, Pemberton asked in writing his four division commanders if they believed their men could &quot;make the marches and undergo the fatigues necessary to accomplish a successful evacuation&quot; after 45 days of siege. With four votes of no, the next day, Pemberton asked the U.S. soldiers for an armistice to allow time for the discussion of terms of surrender, and at 10:00 a.m. on July 4, he surrendered the city and his army to Grant. The written terms (which in the first talks were simply unconditional surrender) were negotiated so that the Confederate soldiers would be paroled and:

Pemberton surrendered 2,166 officers and 27,230 men, 172 cannons, and almost 60,000 muskets and rifles to Grant. This, combined with the successful Siege of Port Hudson on July 9, reestablished the United States complete control over the Mississippi River, a major strategic loss for the Confederacy that cut off Lt. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith&#x27;s command and the Trans-Mississippi Theater from the Confederacy for the rest of the war.

After his surrender, Pemberton was exchanged as a prisoner on October 13, 1863, and returned to Richmond. There he spent some eight months without an assignment. At first, Gen. Braxton Bragg thought he could use Pemberton. Still, after conferring with his ranking officers, he advised Davis that taking on the discredited lieutenant general &quot;would not be advisable.&quot; Pemberton finally wrote Davis directly, asking to return to duty &quot;in any capacity in which you think I may be useful.&quot; Davis replied that his confidence in him remained unshaken, saying:


Pemberton resigned as a general officer on May 9, 1864, and Davis offered him a commission as a lieutenant colonel of artillery three days later, which he accepted, a testimonial of his loyalty to the Confederacy and the Confederate cause. He commanded the artillery of the defenses of Richmond until January 9, 1865. He was appointed inspector general of the artillery as of January 7, and held this position until he was captured in Salisbury, North Carolina, on April 12. Along with Pemberton and his 14 remaining guns, the U.S. soldiers rounded up about 1,300 men and nearly 10,000 small arms. There is no record of his parole after his capture.

==Postbellum life==
After the war, Pemberton lived on his farm near Warrenton, Virginia, from 1866 to 1876. He carried on a feud with Johnston about the Vicksburg campaign. His mother, Rebecca Clifford Pemberton (1782–1869), survived her husband John Pemberton (1783–1847) by more than two decades, and a few years after her death, Pemberton returned to Pennsylvania.

==Death and legacy==

Pemberton died in Lower Gwynedd Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 1881, although his widow Martha Thompson Pemberton would survive until 1907. The families of several famous people, including General George Meade and Admiral John A. Dahlgren (whose brother also served as a Confederate General), protested against the unrepentant Confederate Pemberton&#x27;s burial at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, where his mother and father had been buried. He was interred at the cemetery despite a supposed decision that he would be interred elsewhere. He is the only Confederate general buried in Philadelphia.

A statue depicting Pemberton, sculpted by Edmond Thomas Quinn, was erected in the Vicksburg National Military Park. His grandson, also John C. Pemberton, in 1942 published a book about his grandfather&#x27;s defense of Vicksburg, and donated family papers and his research concerning his grandfather to the University of North Carolina, which maintains them in its Special Collections.

<text>Robin Mark Ventura (born July 14, 1967) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and manager. Ventura played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox, New York Mets, New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers. He was also the manager for the White Sox for five seasons. The White Sox selected Ventura with the tenth overall pick in the 1988 amateur draft from Oklahoma State University (OSU). He is a six-time Rawlings Gold Glove winner, two-time MLB All-Star selection and a National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee.

While playing college baseball for the Cowboys at OSU, Ventura was a three-time All-American who achieved a Division I-record 58-game hitting streak. In 1988, he won the Dick Howser Trophy and Golden Spikes Award and played for the gold medal-winning Olympic baseball team. In his MLB career, he hit 18 grand slams, ranking fifth all-time. In Game 5 of the 1999 National League Championship Series, Ventura hit the &quot;Grand Slam Single&quot; that won the game but did not actually become a home run because he was unable to complete the circuit around the base paths. Later in his playing career, cartilage and arthritis issues in his ankle hampered his abilities in the field.

After the 2011 season, the White Sox hired Ventura to be their manager. He managed the team from 2012 until 2016.

==Amateur career==
Born to parents John and Darlene Ventura on July 14, 1967, in Santa Maria, California, Ventura is of Italian and Portuguese descent. After attending Righetti High School in Orcutt, California, Ventura was a 3-time All-American at Oklahoma State University, where he played college baseball for the Oklahoma State Cowboys.

With the Cowboys, Ventura led the nation in runs (107), runs batted in (RBIs; 96) and total bases (204) in 69 games as a freshman in 1986. In 1987, he had an NCAA-record 58-game hitting streak, breaking the previous record of 47; he also led Division I in RBIs two years in a row. His hitting streak remains the Division I record, though his mark was surpassed in 2003 by Damian Costantino of Division III Salve Regina University, who had a 60-game streak.
Ventura helped OSU reach the finals of the 1987 College World Series, although they lost the championship game to a Stanford University team that included future teammate Jack McDowell. Ventura collected four hits – including a pair of doubles – in the final game and batted .364 for the series. That summer, he played for the Hyannis Mets in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), hitting .370 and led the league in runs batted in with 37. On January 19, 2002, Ventura was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2001. In January 2020, Ventura returned to Oklahoma State to complete his degree and serves as a student assistant coach for the baseball team.

In 1988, Ventura earned a spot on the gold medal-winning Olympic baseball team, batting .409 during the tournament. He won both the Golden Spikes Award and the Dick Howser Trophy for outstanding collegiate play, concluding his 3-year OSU career with a .428 batting average, a .792 slugging percentage, and 302 RBI. On July 4, 2006, Ventura was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame as a member of its inaugural class.

==Professional career==
===Chicago White Sox===
After being picked tenth in the 1988 Major League Baseball draft by the White Sox, Ventura spent much of at AA Birmingham before joining the White Sox that September. While in Birmingham, he earned a spot in the Southern League All-Star Game and was voted the league&#x27;s top defensive third baseman. He was named to the 1990 Topps All-Star Rookie Roster and earned the starting third base role with the White Sox the next spring. While his rookie year was marred by an 0-for-41 slump and 25 errors, his 123 hits were the most by a White Sox rookie since Ozzie Guillén in 1985; he also led AL rookies with 150 games played. The next year he won his first Gold Glove Award for fielding excellence, set a team record for RBI at third base, and led the AL in putouts. In , Ventura won another Gold Glove and earned a spot on the All-Star team.

In , Ventura saw his batting average drop 20 points to .262, though both his slugging and on-base percentages rose slightly. He also collected his 500th hit that May and won his third straight Gold Glove, while becoming the first AL third baseman with three consecutive 90-RBI campaigns since Graig Nettles (1975–78). On August 4, 1993, during a game against the Texas Rangers, Ventura was hit by a pitch thrown by Nolan Ryan. Ventura charged the mound, where Ryan, 20 years Ventura&#x27;s senior, placed Ventura in a headlock and punched him six times, causing a bench-clearing brawl. This brawl was voted the top baseball brawl of all time by ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. The White Sox won the AL West that year, which resulted in Ventura&#x27;s only playoff trip while in Chicago. They would lose in the ALCS to the Toronto Blue Jays.

When play resumed in following the 1994 strike, Ventura had ten errors in the first ten games. He spent some time at first base that year amid trade rumors, but ended the year with a career-high .295 average, and on September 4 hit two grand slams in one game, the eighth player in history to do so and the first since Frank Robinson in 1970. The next season, he won his fourth Gold Glove, reached new highs in fielding percentage, homers and RBIs, and set team records in career homers by a third baseman (142) and grand slams (9).

When spring training began in the White Sox were picked by many to win their division. In a spring training game at Ed Smith Stadium, Ventura slid into home plate and caught his foot in the mud, suffering a compound fracture and dislocation to his right ankle. The initial prognosis was that he would be lost for the season. However, Ventura was able to return on July 24, more than a week ahead of the most optimistic predictions. He collected the game-winning hit that night, and homered in his first at-bat the next evening. The White Sox did not make the playoffs, in part due to the &quot;White Flag Trade&quot;. In , Ventura&#x27;s final season with the Sox, he won his fifth Gold Glove, but only hit .263. His homer and RBI totals were close to his career averages, but the White Sox attempted repeatedly to trade him and declined to renew his contract, with owner Jerry Reinsdorf claiming that he was &quot;deteriorating.&quot;

===New York Mets===
 Ventura departed Chicago in December 1998 when the New York Mets signed him to a four-year deal. In his first year in New York, Ventura hit .301 with 32 homers, 120 RBI and just nine errors in the field. On May 20, he became the first player ever to hit a grand slam in both games of a doubleheader. In 1999, he and fellow infielders Edgardo Alfonzo, Rey Ordóñez, and John Olerud were featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as the &quot;Best Infield Ever.&quot; However, Ventura injured his left knee in August; when the problem finally came to light, just before the postseason, it had worsened into a tear of the cartilage. Ventura borrowed the phrase &quot;Mojo Risin&quot; from The Doors&#x27; &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; and made it the rally cry for the Mets that year, meeting Doors lead singer Jim Morrison&#x27;s widow Patricia Kennealy-Morrison when the Mets invited her to a game just before the playoffs.

Despite his injury, Ventura provided the game-winning, bases-loaded, two-out single in the eleventh inning against the Pirates on the final weekend of the regular season. After sweeping Pittsburgh, the Mets defeated the Cincinnati Reds in a play-in game to determine the National League Wild Card team. In Game 5 of the 1999 NLCS, with the Atlanta Braves up 3–2 in the fifteenth inning, a bases-loaded walk to Todd Pratt forced in the tying run and brought Ventura to the plate. Ventura hit a home run into right-center field. Pratt, however, did not see the ball leave the park and ran back to first base, hoisting Ventura into the air and lugging him off the field before he could round the bases. The hit was officially scored an RBI single, commonly referred to as the &quot;Grand Slam Single.&quot; The Mets eventually lost the series. He won his first NL Gold Glove that fall, bringing his career total to six.

In , still recovering from off-season surgery on both his knee and right shoulder, he hit just .232 with 24 homers and 84 RBI. He spent part of July on the disabled list with inflammation in his repaired shoulder, and was plagued with errors; but rebounded to hit .320 with three homers and 13 RBIs in the last two weeks of the season. When the Mets reached the World Series, he hit his only World Series home run against the Yankees&#x27; Orlando Hernández. In , he batted .237 with 21 homers and 61 RBI.

===New York Yankees===
At the end of the season, the Mets traded Ventura to the Yankees for David Justice. In , Ventura batted .247 with 27 homers and 93 RBI, the eighth time he topped 90 RBI. He was selected to his second and final All-Star team, along with all other members of the Yankees infield. In that year, Ventura had the lowest fielding percentage of all third basemen in the major leagues at .941. The Yankees lost the Division Series, where Ventura hit .286 with four RBI.

After hitting free agency, Ventura re-signed with the Yankees on a one-year deal with $5 million. In , he was platooned at third base with Todd Zeile, another former Met. Ventura struggled through the first few months of the year; by late July he hit nine homers and 42 RBI. He tied Shea Hillenbrand for the major league lead in errors by a third baseman, with 23.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On July 31, , Ventura was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Bubba Crosby and Scott Proctor. On August 3, he hit an inside-the-park home run in Atlanta for his first home run as a member of the Dodgers. He spent most of the remainder of the season on the bench.

Re-signed by the Dodgers in December, Ventura entered with a chance to be the Dodgers&#x27; starting first baseman, but that changed during the last week of spring training when new general manager Paul DePodesta traded for Cleveland outfielder Milton Bradley. This set off a domino effect that ended in Ventura being relegated to a bench role as a backup infielder and pinch hitter.

He had a game-winning RBI in the second game of the season against the San Diego Padres. He only hit five home runs that season, two of which were pinch-hit game-winning home runs: on July 17 against the Arizona Diamondbacks and on August 1 against the San Diego Padres. He also hit his 17th career grand slam on August 29 against the Mets and his 18th career grand slam on September 7 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Ventura made his pitching debut on June 25 during a blowout loss against the Anaheim Angels, allowing a single amid three fly ball outs. The Dodgers made it to the NLDS, but lost in four games. The Dodgers went a perfect 10–0 in games that he hit a home run. Ventura retired after the season due to arthritis in his right ankle.

==Post-playing career==
===Retirement===
 Ventura&#x27;s 1997 ankle injury—a compound fracture and dislocation—also affected his leg muscles, which began to atrophy following the accident. Full strength in his leg never returned, and the daily pain from his ankle and leg contributed to Ventura&#x27;s decision to retire from baseball. After retirement, Ventura limped badly and was forced to walk with a cane regularly. On November 18, 2005, Ventura underwent an ankle allograft. Following the surgery and rehabilitation, he now walks without pain and without a limp. He returned to Shea Stadium for the final game on September 28, 2008, for the closing ceremonies with ex-teammates Edgardo Alfonzo, John Franco, Todd Zeile and Mike Piazza.

Ventura&#x27;s first year of eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame was in 2010, when he received just 1.3% of the votes, failing to reach the 5.0% threshold to stay on the ballot. His next opportunity for Hall of Fame consideration will be in 2023 by the Expansion Era Committee.

He was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame in 2018. In January 2020, Ventura returned to Oklahoma State to complete his degree and serve as a student assistant coach for the baseball team. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 2022. Ventura remained on staff with the Cowboys as a volunteer assistant for the 2023 season.

===Managerial career===
In June 2011, Ventura joined the White Sox organization as special advisor to director of player development Buddy Bell. Just four months later, he was hired as the 39th manager for the Chicago White Sox on October 6, 2011, succeeding interim manager Don Cooper (who succeeded Ozzie Guillén for two games). Ventura was the 17th former White Sox player to manage the club. In his first season as their manager, the White Sox finished 85–77, three games behind the AL Central champion Detroit Tigers. Ventura&#x27;s first ejection as a manager came on May 30, 2012, when he was thrown out by umpire Mark Wegner while protesting Wegner&#x27;s ejection of White Sox pitcher José Quintana. Ventura was a finalist to be the American League Manager of the Year, which was ultimately awarded to Oakland Athletics manager Bob Melvin. Despite ending 2013 in last place, the White Sox re-signed Ventura for the 2014 season.

Chicago planned to bring him back for the 2017 season, despite growing dissatisfaction with Ventura among the fan base. However, after four straight losing seasons, he resigned after the 2016 season.

===Broadcasting===
Ventura has also provided color commentary for the College World Series. In 2010, he worked as a color commentator for the Little League Southwest Region Finals on ESPN with Carter Blackburn. Ventura also occasionally appeared on ESPNU as an anchor.

<doc id="651934" wikidata="Q4774382" url="?curid=651934" title="Anti-incumbency">
<text>Anti-incumbency is sentiment in favor of voting out incumbent politicians, for the specific reason of being incumbent politicians. It is sometimes referred to as a &quot;throw the bums out&quot; sentiment. Periods of anti-incumbent sentiment are typically characterized by wave elections. This sentiment can also lead to support for term limits.

In a two-party system, anti-incumbent voters have only one party to vote for, when voting against the incumbent; in a multi-party system, public mood, i.e., the tendency of opinions held by voters over a set of related policy issues, can determine which parties receive the anti-incumbent vote.

==Causes==
When voters perceive times as bad, this can cause anti-incumbent sentiment. However, this is subject to biases. Perceptions of whether, e.g., economic conditions have worsened during a politician&#x27;s term are influenced by partisan bias, for instance. In the United States, reliance on partisan media, as opposed to mainstream media, is associated with anti-incumbent attitudes toward Congress. New democracies&#x27; elections, such as those in Central and Eastern Europe, and in Latin America and Asia, often are characterized by anti-incumbency.

==History==
===Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, virtually every government has been ousted from power after one legislative period.

===Bhutan===
The 2018 Bhutanese National Assembly election had an anti-incumbent result.

===India===
India has the highest rate of anti-incumbency in the world, with incumbents from the ruling party having only a fifty-fifty shot at returning to parliament. For example, since 1985, the electorate in Assam, India has oscillated between voting the Asom Gana Parishad and the Indian National Congress to power. In Karnataka, the last time the ruling government was re-elected was in the 1985 Indian elections. Kerala has always voted in whichever is the opposition pre-poll alliance since 1982 assembly elections. Voter turnout does not appear correlated with incumbents&#x27; electoral performance.

In 2018, India&#x27;s period of anti-incumbency was accompanied by acute rural distress, multiple farmer agitations and serious joblessness.

===Mexico===
In the 2010 Mexican gubernatorial elections, incumbents from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, National Action Party, and Party of the Democratic Revolution were rejected.

===United States===
Eras of anti-incumbent sentiment included the Gilded Age, in which the majority party in the U.S. House of Representatives shifted six times in the 15 Congressional elections between 1870 and 1900, with three of those shifts involving losses of more than 70 seats by the majority party. David M. Kennedy notes, &quot;Generations of American scholars have struggled to find a coherent narrative or to identify heroic leaders in that era&#x27;s messy and inconclusive political scene.&quot;

The 1992 United States elections were also characterized by anti-incumbent sentiment, as a stubborn recession and persistently high unemployment fuelled voter dissatisfaction. A 2013 poll found that 60% of Americans would vote to &quot;defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including [their] own representative&quot; if that option were available.

The 2024 United States presidential election also has fueled considerable anti-incumbent sentiment, particularly among Generation Z, primarily due to immigration policy, post-COVID inflation, the Israel–Palestine conflict, and the age of the incumbent president at the time.

The concept of anti-incumbency, at least with regard to U.S. elections, is controversial, since more often voters will punish only one party. Three organizations that supported voting out incumbents were Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out, Vote Out Incumbents Democracy and Tenure Corrupts.

==Criticism==
A perceived disadvantage of anti-incumbency, with regard to judicial elections, is that good lawyers will not want to accept what they regard as a revolving-door judgeship. Another criticism of anti-incumbency is that it causes political parties to focus on single-term policies rather than long-term development.

<text>The Leichter Panzerspähwagen (German: &quot;light armoured reconnaissance vehicle&quot;) was a series of light four-wheel drive armoured cars produced by Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1944.

==Development history==
The Sd.Kfz. 221 was the first in a series of light reconnaissance vehicles designed to meet operational requirements including reliability, an ability to run on a variety of grades of fuel, simple construction and good off-road performance. However, this type proved too small and too lightly armed, so in 1936-37 a heavier version was planned, using one of two standard chassis for four-wheeled armoured cars - one with a front-mounted engine, the other rear-mounted. The latter was used in the Sd.Kfz. 222, which then became the standard light armoured car in German army service until the defeat of Nazi Germany.

The vehicles were developed by Eisenwerk Weserhütte of Bad Oeynhausen by using the chassis of the type Horch 108 (one of the &quot;Einheits-PKW der Wehrmacht&quot; standardised designs of heavy off-road car for the armed forces) with an angled armoured body and turret.

Chassis were built by Horch (Auto Union) in Zwickau and assembled by F. Schichau of Elbing and Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen in Hanover-Linden.

The rear-mounted petrol engine was originally a 3.5 Litre Horch V8 with (Ausf. A chassis); from 1942, this was replaced by a 3.8 Litre with (Ausf. B chassis), giving it a road speed of and a cross-country speed of . It had a maximum range of .

Used by the reconnaissance battalions (&quot;Aufklärungs-Abteilung&quot;) of the Panzer divisions, the type performed well enough in countries with good road networks, like those in Western Europe. However, on the Eastern Front and in the deserts of the North African campaign, this class of vehicle was hampered by its relatively poor off-road performance.

The Sd.Kfz. 222 was fitted with heavier armament and a larger turret than the Sd.Kfz. 221 but it was still comparatively cramped and lacked top protection other than a wire screen designed to allow grenades to roll off, but this made using the main armament problematic. The machine gun was mounted co-axially with the autocannon, and both weapons were pintle-mounted, and fitted with an elevation and traverse mechanism and floor-mounted firing mechanisms. The turret was rotated by the traversing weapons rather than the weapons being fixed to a traversing turret. There was thus no bearing-ring and no turret basket, only a fighting compartment largely obstructed by the breeches of the weapons.

When the limitations of the vehicle were highlighted during the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 the Sd.Kfz. 222 was gradually replaced in the reconnaissance role by the Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track, but the turret and armament of the Sd Kfz 222 was sometimes retained, despite its shortcomings (the Sd.Kfz. 250/9 variant was a Sd.Kfz. 250 fitted with a top plate surmounted by the same turret and gun combination of the Sd.Kfz 222 fitted to the half-track) Captured Sd.Kfz 222s were examined by Soviet designers before they created the similar BA-64 light armoured car.

Front and sides were made of RHA; thinner plates protected the top, rear, and bottom. Cast vision ports later replaced ports cut into the armour. The open-topped turret was fitted with wire mesh anti-grenade screens. Beginning in 1939, the front armour was increased to . In 1942, the Ausf. B chassis was introduced; this had 30 mm of frontal armour, as well as a more powerful engine.

==Variants==
;Sd. Kfz. 221
Base model and first production series of light armoured car built on a standardised chassis for military use; full designation was &quot;Leichter Panzerspähwagen (M.G.)&quot; The Sd.Kfz. 221 was armed with a single 7.92 mm &quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; (MG) 13 machine gun, replaced from 1938 onwards with a &quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; (MG) 34. It had a two-man crew (driver and commander/gunner), and was equipped with four-wheel drive. Production ran from 1935 to 1940 with at least 339 vehicles produced. It was only produced with Ausf. A chassis and a maximum frontal armour of 14.5 mm. Some Sd. Kfz 221 were rearmed with a 2.8 cm sPzB 41 heavy anti-tank rifle in a modified turret. 

;Sd. Kfz. 222
This version of the vehicle was armed with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and one MG 13 machine gun; full designation was &quot;Leichter Panzerspähwagen (2 cm)&quot;. The crew was increased to three by the addition of a gunner, relieving the commander of that task. In 1938, the MG 13 was replaced by an MG 34, and in 1942 the KwK 30 was replaced by the faster-firing KwK 38 of the same calibre. Production ran from 1937 to late 1943, with at least 990 vehicles produced. 

;Sd. Kfz. 223
An armoured car with similar features to the Sd. Kfz. 221, but with the addition of a frame antenna and a 30-watt &quot;FuG 10&quot; medium-range radio set; full designation was &quot;Leichter Panzerspähwagen (Fu)&quot;. Later versions of the vehicle were equipped with an improved 80-watt &quot;FuG&quot; &quot;12&quot; radio set. It was originally armed with an MG 13 machine gun, but in 1938 this was changed to an MG 34. The three-man crew consisted of a driver, commander and radio operator. Production ran from 1936 to January 1944, with at least 567 vehicles produced.

;&quot;Kleiner Panzerfunkwagen&quot; Sd. Kfz. 260/261
Unarmed radio car versions with long-range radio equipment and a large &quot;bed-frame&quot; antenna over the vehicle. Generally for signals use, three were used as armoured cars in Finland. The Sd. Kfz 260 was equipped with radio sets to communicate with aircraft, and the Sd.Kfz. 261 with radio sets to communicate with other ground units. By 1 September 1940, the manufacturers had orders for 36 Sd.Kfz. 260 and 289 Sd.Kfz. 261. Production ran from April 1941 to April 1943, with 483 vehicles of both types produced.

<doc id="651941" wikidata="Q716116" url="?curid=651941" title="Tony Granato">
<text>Anthony Lewis Granato (born July 25, 1964) is an American former professional ice hockey left winger and former head coach of the Wisconsin Badgers men&#x27;s ice hockey team. He served as head coach of the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Previously, he was the head coach of the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Colorado Avalanche, as well as an assistant coach for the Detroit Red Wings and the Pittsburgh Penguins.

==Playing career==

===New York Rangers===
After high school, Granato was drafted by the New York Rangers in the sixth round, 120th overall, in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft. After a college career at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Granato made an immediate impact in his first season with the Rangers in 1988–89, leading the team in goals scored (36), which still stands as the team record for goals by a rookie. In what Rangers at the time called &quot;the biggest [deal] in club history&quot;, Granato was traded with teammate Tomas Sandström to the Los Angeles Kings on January 20, 1990, in exchange for center Bernie Nicholls.

===Los Angeles Kings===
Granato continued to be a prolific goal scorer with the Kings and was a key player in their run to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, contributing 17 points over the course of the playoffs. During a February 9, 1994, game in Los Angeles, Granato, after receiving a hard hit from the Chicago Blackhawks&#x27; Neil Wilkinson, retaliated by hitting Wilkinson in the head with a two-handed slash. Granato was subsequently suspended by the NHL for 15 games. As of 2012, this was the seventh-longest suspension in NHL history. On January 25, 1996, Granato suffered a serious head injury in a game against the Hartford Whalers that resulted in a bleeding on the left lobe of his brain. He underwent surgery and although there was speculation he would not play again, he returned to the ice in the 1996–97 NHL season after being traded to the San Jose Sharks.

===San Jose Sharks===
Granato returned to the ice in the 1996–97 NHL season with San Jose. Due to concerns of further brain injury, Granato wore a specially padded helmet as a precautionary measure. He had a productive first season in San Jose registering 25 goals and 15 assists in 76 games. In 1997, Granato received the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. However, his productivity steadily declined, with only 59 collective points in his remaining four seasons with the Sharks. He retired as a player after the 2001 season.

==Coaching career==
Granato joined the Colorado Avalanche as an assistant coach prior to the 2002–03 NHL season. After a sub-par start to the season, the Avalanche fired head coach Bob Hartley on December 18, 2002, and Granato was subsequently promoted to replace him. Following the slow start under Hartley, the Avalanche went 32–11–4–4 under Granato and captured their ninth consecutive division title (including one title as the Quebec Nordiques). However, they lost in the first round of the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs to the Minnesota Wild in seven games after a 3–1 series lead. In his first full season behind the bench, Granato led Colorado to a 40–22–20 record, finishing second in their division. During the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Avalanche defeated the Dallas Stars in five games in the quarter-finals, but lost to the Sharks in six games in the semi-finals.

After the disappointing playoff loss to the Sharks, Granato was replaced by Joel Quenneville. Granato was reassigned and agreed to stay on as an assistant, holding that position for three seasons. On May 22, 2008, Granato was renamed head coach of the Avalanche after the departure of Quenneville for the 2008–09 NHL season. The Avalanche posted a record of 32–45–5, the worst since the team moved from Quebec in 1995, and Granato was fired on June 5, 2009.

On August 5, 2009, Granato joined the coaching staff of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signing on as an assistant coach. Granato guided the Penguin&#x27;s defense (2.49 goals against per game, tenth) and penalty killing (85.0 percent, fifth) to top-ten league finishes during the 2013–14 NHL season.

On June 25, 2014, it was announced the Penguins would not retain their coaching staff for the 2014–15 season.

On July 15, 2014, Granato was hired as an assistant coach for the Detroit Red Wings.

On March 30, 2016, Granato was named the head coach at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

On August 4, 2017, Granato was announced as the head coach for the United States national team during the 2018 Winter Olympics. His team eventually placed seventh.

On March 6, 2023, University of Wisconsin Director of Athletics Chris McIntosh announced that Granato would not return for the 2023-24 season.

==Personal life==
Granato is the older brother of Hall of Fame hockey player Cammi Granato, and is the brother-in-law of former NHL player Ray Ferraro. Tony and his wife, Linda, are the parents of four children. Tony still has a lot of personal connections to his hometown, Downers Grove. Siblings Don, Rob, and Cammi were influenced by the Chicago Blackhawks and the 1980 Winter Olympics USA gold medal. He is now (2023) a TV analyst for both the NHL and the Chicago Blackhawks.

On December 11, 2023, Granato announced that he had been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and that he would be taking a leave of absence from his television career to begin treatment on the cancer that same week. After a four week absence, Granato returned to broadcasting for the first time on January 7, 2024.

Granato is a Christian.

<doc id="651944" wikidata="Q1988599" url="?curid=651944" title="Pro Evolution Soccer 3">
<text>Pro Evolution Soccer 3 (known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 7 in Japan and World Soccer: Winning Eleven 7 International in North America) is a football simulation video game developed and produced by Konami as part of the &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; series. Initially released for the PlayStation 2, it is also the first in the series to be released on Microsoft Windows.

While the Japanese version featured Japanese national team coach Zico, the European version cover features the image and signature of iconic Italian referee Pierluigi Collina, who had previously officiated the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final. This was unusual, as football games had come to almost exclusively feature only players and managers on their covers; plus, referees only appear in cutscenes in this game (they would only be integrated to the playing field in the next entry of the series). &quot;PES 3&quot; was succeeded by &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 4&quot;, which was released in 2004.

== New features ==
* New graphics engine.
* Improved gameplay, control, ball physics, animation and AI.
* New Shop mode, where points can be traded in for hidden items.
* Master League expanded to four divisions, with tons of new players.
* Support for 1–4 players (multitap required for 3 or 4 players).

== Licenses ==
The game does not include any full leagues but 64 clubs from various European countries. 6 clubs are fully licensed, which are the five Italian Serie A clubs Milan, Roma, Juventus, Lazio and Parma, as well as Feyenoord from the Dutch Eredivisie.
