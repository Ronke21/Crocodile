<text>Governance is the overall complex system or framework of processes, functions, structures, rules, laws and norms born out of the relationships, interactions, power dynamics and communication within an organized group of individuals. It sets the boundaries of acceptable conduct and practices of different actors of the group and controls their decision-making processes through the creation and enforcement of rules and guidelines. Furthermore, it also manages, allocates and mobilizes relevant resources and capacities of different members and sets the overall direction of the group in order to effectively address its specific collective needs, problems and challenges. 

The concept of governance can be applied to social, political or economic entities (groups of individuals engaged in some purposeful activity) such as a state and its government (public administration), a governed territory, a society, a community, a social group (like a tribe or a family), a formal or informal organization, a corporation, a non-governmental organization, a non-profit organization, a project team, a market, a network or even on the global stage. &quot;Governance&quot; can also pertain to a specific sector of activities such as land, environment, health, internet, security, etc. The degree of formality in governance depends on the internal rules of a given entity and its external interactions with similar entities. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. 
Smaller groups may rely on informal leadership structures, whereas effective governance of a larger group typically relies on a well-functioning governing body, which is a specific group of people entrusted with the authority and responsibilities to make decisions about the rules, enforcing them and overseeing the smooth operation of the group within the broader framework of governance. The most formal type of a governing body is a government, which has the responsibility and authority to make binding decisions for a specific geopolitical system (like a country) through established rules and guidelines. A government may operate as a democracy where citizens vote on who should govern towards the goal of public good. Beyond governments, other entities can also have governing bodies. These can be legal entities or organizations, such as corporations, companies or non-profit organizations governed by small boards of directors pursuing more specific aims. They can also be socio-political groups including hierarchical political structures, tribes, religious subgroups, or even families. In the case of a state, governance expresses a growing awareness of the ways in which diffuse forms of power and authority can secure order even in the absence of state activity. A variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence this system of state governance. These include lobbies, think-tanks, political parties, non-government organizations, community and media. Governance is also shaped by external factors such as globalization, social movements or technological progress.

From a normative perspective, good, effective and fair governance involves a well-organized system that fairly represents stakeholders&#x27; interests and needs. Such governance guides the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the group&#x27;s objectives, policies, and programs, ensuring smooth operation in various contexts. It fosters trust by promoting transparency, responsibility, and accountability, and employs mechanisms to resolve disputes and conflicts for greater harmony. It adapts to changing circumstances, keeping the group responsive and resilient. By delivering on its promises and creating positive outcomes, it fosters legitimacy and acceptance of the governing body, leading to rule-compliance, shared responsibility, active cooperation, and ultimately, greater stability and long-term sustainability.

Many institutions of higher education - such as the Balsillie School of International Affairs, Munk School of Global Affairs, Sciences Po Paris, Graduate Institute Geneva, Hertie School, and the London School of Economics, among others - offer governance as an academic subjects. Many social scientists prefer to use the term &quot;governance&quot; when discussing the process of governing, because it covers the whole range of institutions and involved relationships.
Governance encompasses the processes and structures by which decisions are made and enforced within an organization or society. It involves the interplay of laws, social norms, power dynamics, and communication, shaping the conduct and order of a social system. Governance can be exercised by formal entities like governments, organizations, or informal groups. It&#x27;s a dynamic process, adapting to changing circumstances and motivations. Governance is essential for the smooth functioning of any entity, be it a nation, a corporation, or a non-profit organization. It provides a framework for accountability, transparency, and the pursuit of shared goals. The concept of governance is constantly evolving, reflecting the changing dynamics of power and the increasing complexity of global issues.

== Definitions ==
The World Bank defines governance as:
The Worldwide Governance Indicators project of the World Bank defines governance as:

This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.

An alternate definition sees governance as:

According to the United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:
==Origin of the word==

Like &quot;government&quot;, the word &quot;governance&quot; derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb &quot;kubernaein&quot; [&quot;kubernáo&quot;] (meaning &quot;to steer&quot;, the metaphorical sense first being attested in Plato). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early-modern England, when the phrase &quot;governance of the realm&quot; appears in works by William Tyndale and in royal correspondence from James V of Scotland to Henry VIII of England. The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) appears in Charles Plummer&#x27;s &quot;The Governance of England&quot; (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin manuscript by John Fortescue, also known as &quot;The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy&quot;). This usage of &quot;governance&quot; to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in Sidney Low&#x27;s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.

However, the use of the term &quot;governance&quot; in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the UN, the IMF and the World Bank.
Since then, the term has gained increasing usage.

==Types==
Governance often refers to a particular level of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular &#x27;field&#x27; of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular &#x27;model&#x27; of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).

Governance can also define normative or practical agendas. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among political, public sector, voluntary, and private sector organizations.

===Governance as process===
In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist. These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to states, to corporations, to non-profits, to NGOs, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex outsourcing relationships), to project teams, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.

Most theories of governance as process arose out of neoclassical economics. These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on transaction cost economics.

== As a normative concept ==

===Fair governance===

When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of good governance. In the case of a business or of a non-profit organization, for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. &quot;Good governance&quot; implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the &quot;agents&quot;) to respect the rights and interests of the stakeholders (the &quot;principals&quot;), in a spirit of democracy.

===Good governance===
Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Different organisations have defined governance and good governance differently.

===Effective governance===
The effectiveness of governments is not a straightforward and consentient type of governance. Measurement and conceptualization of effectiveness is controversial and often used interchangeably with good governance. However, during the period of 1996–2018, an effort was made by the World Bank to create a comparable measure of the performance of governments; the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). The WGI is constituted by over 30 databases which are rescaled and categorized into six categories; among these is government effectiveness. According to this category, effective governance is composed by five aspects: the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service, the degree of the government&#x27;s independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government&#x27;s commitment to such policies. In short, effective governance is about quality of service, the independence of government and the quality of policies and implementation.

Adding to these components, one might argue that responsiveness to citizen&#x27;s needs is high in an effective government. Acting according to these needs, effectiveness is achieved by transparent, decentralized and neutral structures, that are consistent and disciplined. Therefore, efficient financial management, high-quality and committed personnel and formalized and standardized ways of processes is needed. For the latter, governments became much more efficient with the arise of bureaucracies. Nevertheless, governments in a rapidly changing environment need to be able to adapt quickly, so being bounded by rigid structures of functioning could work as a detriment.

Since the conceptualization of effective governance is not onefold, some more components that might constitute it are suggested: “It should be small in extent with limited intervention in the economy; a clear vision and processes; committed quality personnel that can formulate and implement policies and projects; comprehensive participation with the public; efficient financial management; responsive, transparent and decentralized structures and political stability”.

==== Internal and external effective governance ====
The components of effective governance described above all have a domestic character, within the boundaries of the national territory, national policies and about the inhabitants of a country. This is the internal aspect of effective governance, which mainly focuses on national services and policies. The external aspect of effective governance on the other hand, exclusively focuses on the international domain of politics. It entails the state&#x27;s capacity to exercise its rights and fulfil its duties in alignment with international law, the representation of its people in the international political landscape and its participation in international relations.

The purpose of effective governance in the internal aspect is to be the sovereign within its national territory; in the external aspect to wield sovereignty over international relations. For this reason, it is a necessary characteristic of the state to have unrestricted capacity to act, without any form of dependence in both state and international law. This independency is the core of statehood.

==== Effects of effective governance ====
In an attempt to identify predictors of effective government, a study was conducted to investigate what characteristics of the state are more deeply established by effective governance. The most striking conclusion was that effective governance has a big share in the economic growth and developing, although on the long term. However, this is a bi-directional relationship: economic growth does lead to more effective governance as well. Moreover, effective governance does have a positive influence on reducing corruption, strengthening political stability, contribution to improved rule of law and improved government spending and accountability. As is the case with economic development, it is plausible the argue that effective governance and the named predictors are a positive feedback cycle: they reinforce each other, and so indirectly themselves.

==== Absence of effective governance ====
When a state fails to govern effectively, this does not simply imply the absence of the characteristics of effective governance. First of all, the absence of effective governance is lack of capacity of the state to supply its inhabitants with political goods, such as rights and freedoms. Zartman describes how absence of effective governance comes about: “as the disintegration ofstate structure, authority (legitimate power), law, and political order”. Five main characteristics are to be differentiated in the absence of effective governance: disorganizing of the structure of the processes in the state, violent conflicts, violations of human rights and social fragmentation, all of which have an endogenous character.

===Measurement and assessment===

Since the early years of the 2000s (decade), efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the world. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the African Peer Review Mechanism. Examples of self-assessments are country-led assessments that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.

One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the Worldwide Governance Indicators project, developed by members of the World Bank and the World Bank Institute. The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the World Bank Governance Surveys, which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country&#x27;s own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.

A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability. Section 10 of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.

The International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the Open Budget Initiative in 2006 with the release of the first Open Budget Survey (OBS). The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created Open Budget Index (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new OBS Tracker, which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents. The Open Budget Index data are used by the Open Government Partnership, development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds. Examples of country-led assessments include the Indonesian Democracy Index, monitoring of the Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia and the Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan.

Section 10 of the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their performance plans and reports in machine-readable format, thereby providing the basis for evaluating the quality of their performance of the governance functions entrusted to them, as specified in their strategic objectives and performance indicators. Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record.

== By field of governance (society) ==

=== Collaborative governance ===
A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.

=== Environmental governance ===
=== Global governance ===
=== Health governance ===
According to the WHO, &quot;governance in the health sector refers to a wide range of steering and rule-making related functions carried out by governments/decisions makers as they seek to achieve national health policy objectives that are conducive to universal health coverage.&quot; A national health policy is a complex and dynamic process, which changes from State to State according to the political, historical and socio-economic situation prevailing in the country. Mainly it seeks to strengthen the health system, making sure that they are capable of meeting the health needs of targeted populations.

More broadly, health governance requires a synergistic set of policies, many of which reside in sectors other than health as well as governors beyond the national governments, which must be supported by structures and mechanisms that enable collaboration. For instance, in the European context, a health policy framework called Health 2020 was developed as a result of the collaboration between State members in the region. It gives policy-makers a vision, a strategic path and a set of priorities to improve health, guaranteeing that it is more equitable and sustainable.

In the 21st century, global trends (e.g., changing population demographics and epidemiology, widening social inequalities, and a context of financial uncertainty) have influenced health system priorities and subsequently the setting of the health governance function. These trends have resulted in the emergence of joint actions of all stakeholders to achieve seminal changes in 21st-century societies. It is also important to consider that people have witnessed a global shift from traditional and reactive healthcare to proactive care, mainly enabled by investment in advanced technologies. Recent artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning have made possible the automation as well as the standardisation of many processes in healthcare, which have also brought to light challenges to the existing governance structures. One of these challenges concerns the ownership of health data.

=== Metagovernance ===
&quot;Metagovernance&quot; is the &quot;governing of governing&quot;. It represents the established ethical principles, or &#x27;norms&#x27;, that shape and steer the entire governing process.

There are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some believe metagovernance to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can &quot;potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor&quot; who wishes to influence the governing process. Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government, and media focus on specific issues at the sociocultural level. Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted &#x27;norms&#x27;. The fact that &#x27;norms&#x27; can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.

=== Multi-level governance ===
Multi-level governance is the concept and study of the fact that many intertangled authority structures are present in a global political economy. The theory of multi-level governance, developed mainly by Liesbet Hooghe and Gary Marks, arose from increasing European integration, particularly through the European Union. José Manuel Barroso, former President of the European Commission, has stated that &quot;the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union&#x27;s competitive edge&quot; and that, in times of economic crisis, &quot;multilevel governance must be a priority.&quot;

===Participatory governance===
Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The theoretical framework of participatory governance as a variant of governing can be dated back to the early 1990s when academics began to stress the need for citizen participation in the government process. This decentralization of state power &quot;strength[ens] vertical accountability&quot; improving the relationship between citizens and municipal governments. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.

The role of citizens in participatory governance is to be afforded a form of state power as an elected group of non-political citizens to contribute to the public policy process. Different manifestations of participatory governance include participatory budgeting, councils, and community organizations involved at the state level, taking on state studies or participating in social issues. Over the last two decades, the most rapidly growing form of participatory governance has been participatory budgeting. In 2004, the British Columbia Citizens Assembly was the first form of direct citizen engagement created to envision the provincial electoral system. Adopted by Brazil, participatory budgeting was used to &quot;enhance citizens&#x27; empowerment and the quality of [their] democracy.&quot; Both examples contributed to the discussion of increasing citizen engagement as a mechanism to increase the effectiveness, legitimacy, and social justice of democratic governance.

Action through participatory governance impacts policy at the municipal level. An example is the use of municipal housing councils in Brazil to impact policy adoption, which finds that housing councils are associated with a greater likelihood of program adoption beneficial to the needs reflected by the citizens. The mechanism of participatory governance links the social sphere to the political to produce policies directly molded by or influenced by citizens. Therefore, participatory governance potentially improves public service delivery and the allocation of resources.

=== Public governance ===
There is a distinction between the concepts of governance and politics. Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common policy. Governance, on the other hand, conveys the administrative and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones. This distinction assumes the possibility of the traditional separation between &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;administration&quot;. Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both &quot;governance&quot; and &quot;politics&quot; involve aspects of power and accountability.

In general terms, public governance occurs in various ways:
* through networks involving public-private partnerships (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations
* through the use of market mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation
* through the formation and execution of consensus
* through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and their state bureaucracy

=== Regulatory governance ===
Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending. The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic. The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.

===Security sector governance===
Security sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about security and their implementation within the security sector of a single state. SSG applies the principles of good governance to the security sector in question.

== By field of governance (other) ==

=== Contract governance ===
Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way. In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the &quot;framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided&quot;, adding further that &quot;because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.&quot;

=== Corporate governance ===
Corporate governance refers to the mechanisms, processes, practices, and relations by which corporations are controlled and operated by their boards of directors, managers, shareholders, and stakeholders. Corporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control an organization. Corporate governance also includes the relationships between people within an organization, (the stakeholders) and the corporate goals. The principal players include the shareholders, management, and the board of directors. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.

===Information technology governance===
IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure that investment in IT generates business value and mitigates the risks that are associated with IT projects.

=== Internet governance ===
Internet governance was defined by the World Summit on the Information Society as &quot;the development and application by Governments, the private sector and civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet.&quot; Internet governance deals with how much influence each sector of society should have on the development of the Internet, such as to what extent the state should be able to censor it, and how issues on the Internet, such as cyber-bullying and criminal behavior should be approached.

=== Land governance ===

Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘land grabbing’. The operational dimension of land governance is land administration.

Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business – hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.

There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance. For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called &#x27;land grabbing&#x27;, was partly made possible by the Washington Consensus-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.

The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as land administration: ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’. And another factor is accountability: the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.

The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT), endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS).

=== Landscape governance ===
Landscape governance roughly refers to the rules, processes and institutions according to which decisions regarding the protection, management and planning of the landscape are made. Landscape governance differs from country to country according to the national context (e.g., political system, organization of public administration, economy, culture etc.). Generally, landscape governance could be described asboth an empirical observation and a normative idea based on the principles of place-based multi-stakeholder dialogue, negotiation and spatial decision-making, and aims to achieve environmental, economic and social objectives simultaneously. The current discourse about landscape governance calls for participatory and inclusive processes, that take into account the local realities (i.e. biophysical, cultural, social parameters), and the local needs and concerns of the multiple landscape agents; and effectively deal with cases of conflicting interests, ensuring the democratic and just treatment of the landscape.

The introduction of holistic approaches to landscape governance is the focus of the evolving interdisciplinary landscape research. Such an approach is the conceptualization of landscape as a commons. The discussion about commons-based landscape governance puts forward the need for open technologies (i.e. accessible, under creative commons licenses, open-source) that can facilitate public access to landscape data (e.g., maps/satellite images for the study and monitoring of landscape change) and the distributed participation in the decision making, mapping and planning (e.g. open platforms).

=== Private governance ===
Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, dispute resolution organizations, or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the &quot;quality of life and opportunities of the larger public.&quot; Simply put, private—not public—entities are making public policy. For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers. The term &quot;public policy&quot; should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by government. Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is &quot;governmental policy&quot;, which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.

=== Project governance ===
Project governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made and outcomes of a project are realized. Its role is to provide a repeatable and robust system through which an organization can manage its capital investments—project governance handles tasks such as outlining the relationships between all groups involved and describing the flow of information to all stakeholders.

<text>David Allen Johnson (born January 30, 1943) is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He played as a second baseman from through , most notably in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won four American League pennants and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1971. Johnson played in MLB from 1965 to 1975, then played for two seasons in the Nippon Professional Baseball league before returning to play in MLB with the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs from 1977 to 1978. A three-time Rawlings Gold Glove Award winner, he was selected to four All-Star Game teams during his playing career.

After retiring as a player, Johnson became a successful manager. He led the New York Mets to the 1986 World Series title, and to an additional National League East title in 1988. He won the American League&#x27;s Manager of the Year Award in 1997, when he led the Baltimore Orioles wire-to-wire to the American League East division championship. He won the same award in the National League in 2012, when he led the Washington Nationals to the franchise&#x27;s first division title since moving to Washington, D.C., and its first overall since 1981. Johnson managed teams to their respective League Championship Series in three consecutive years  – the Cincinnati Reds in 1995 and the Orioles in both 1996 and 1997. He also briefly managed the Los Angeles Dodgers. He led the United States national team to its first medal finish in a World Baseball Classic, taking third place at the 2009 edition.

==Playing career==
After one season playing baseball at Texas A&amp;M University, Johnson signed with the Baltimore Orioles as an amateur free agent in 1962. Johnson was then assigned to the Stockton Ports in the Class C California League where he hit .309 with 10 home runs and 63 runs batted in in 97 games. Promoted to the AA Elmira Pioneers in 1963, Johnson hit .326 in 63 games before advancing to the AAA Rochester Red Wings for the final 63 games of the season. Returning to the Red Wings for the entire 1964 season, Johnson had 19 HRs, 73 RBIs, and 87 runs.

In 1965, Johnson made the Orioles out of spring training, but after hitting only .170 in 20 games he spent the latter part of the season with the Red Wings, batting .301 in 52 games. Back with the Orioles in 1966, Johnson saw limited playing time until the Orioles created space in the lineup for him by trading second baseman Jerry Adair to the Chicago White Sox on June 13. Johnson then hit for a .257 batting average, seven home runs and 56 RBIs to finish third in American League Rookie of the Year balloting for 1966. Johnson was a full-time starter in the major leagues for the next eight seasons, averaging over 142 games played in a season.

Johnson reached the World Series with the Orioles in , , , and , winning World Series rings in 1966 and 1970. He also won the AL Gold Glove Award the final three seasons. Orioles shortstop Mark Belanger won the award as well in 1969 and 1971, joining a select list of shortstop-second baseman combinations to have won the honor in the same season. Third baseman Brooks Robinson also was in the middle of his record 16 straight Gold Glove streak when Johnson and Belanger won their awards.

Upset after being replaced as the starting second baseman by Bobby Grich, and with the Orioles in need of a power-hitting catcher, Johnson was traded along with Pat Dobson, Johnny Oates and Roric Harrison to the Atlanta Braves for Earl Williams and Taylor Duncan on the last day of the Winter Meetings on December 1, 1972. The following season with the Braves, Johnson hit 40 home runs for the first and only time in his career, tying Rogers Hornsby&#x27;s record for most single-season home runs by a second baseman with 42, and hitting a 43rd as a pinch-hitter. Johnson&#x27;s second-highest home run total was 18, in the 1971 season. That same season Atlanta&#x27;s Darrell Evans hit 41 home runs, and Hank Aaron hit 40 homers, making the 1973 Braves the first team to feature three teammates that each hit 40 home runs in the same season.

Four games into the 1975 season and after getting a hit in his only at bat, Johnson was released by the Braves.

He then signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Japan&#x27;s Central League, with whom he played in both the 1975 and 1976 seasons. Johnson was the Giants&#x27; first foreign player of note in more than 15 years, and faced a lot of pressure to perform in Japan. He struggled in his first season, battling injuries, and incurred the wrath of the Giants&#x27; manager (and former Hall of Fame player) Shigeo Nagashima. Despite playing much better in 1976, Johnson was not invited back by the Giants, who also reportedly prevented him from signing with any other NPB teams.

In 1977, Johnson returned to the United States, signing as a free agent with the Philadelphia Phillies. As a utility infielder Johnson still hit .321 with 8 home runs in 78 games and played in one game in the Phillies&#x27; National League Championship Series loss to the Dodgers.

During the 1978 season, Johnson hit two grand slams as a pinch-hitter, becoming the first major leaguer to accomplish this in a season. (Four other players, Mike Ivie (1978), Darryl Strawberry (1998), Ben Broussard (2004), and Brooks Conrad (2010), subsequently equaled Johnson&#x27;s feat.) Shortly afterwards, Philadelphia dealt him to the Chicago Cubs, with whom he played the final 24 games of his career before retiring at the end of the season.

==Managing career==

===Minor leagues===
In 1979, Johnson was hired to be the manager of the Miami Amigos of the AAA Inter-American League. Although Johnson guided the team of released and undrafted players to a .708 winning percentage, the league folded 72 games into its only season, having planned to play a 130-game season. In 1981, Johnson was hired to manage the New York Mets AA team, the Jackson Mets, leading the team to a 68–66 record in his only season with the team. In 1983, Johnson was named as the manager of the Mets AAA Tidewater Tides, which finished with a 71–68 record.

===New York Mets===

Johnson took over the Mets in 1984, a team that had not won a pennant since 1973. He became the first National League manager to win at least 90 games in each of his first five seasons. The highlight of his time with the Mets was winning the 1986 World Series against the Boston Red Sox. While with the Orioles in 1969, Johnson was the final out in the Miracle Mets World Series win.

Years later, he summed up his approach to managing by saying, &quot;I treated my players like men. As long as they won for me on the field, I didn&#x27;t give a flying fuck what they did otherwise.&quot; The 1983 team had won 68 games, but talent was showing for a potential winner with rookie Darryl Strawberry. A trade to acquire Keith Hernandez and Johnson&#x27;s decision to suggest bringing up Dwight Gooden helped turn them into a winner of 90 games for the 1984 season. Gary Carter was acquired before that year, and the Mets won 98 games the next year, but it was only good enough for another second-place finish (three games behind St. Louis). The 1986 team won 108 games, which was the best in the majors. It was only the second time the Mets won 100 games in a season, with the other time being 1969.

The Mets won 92 games the following season, but they fell three games short of matching St. Louis. The next year, they won 100 games to win the division. The NLCS ended with a seven-game loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, which turned on a loss in Game 4 after winning two of the first three games.

He had a bitter feud with general manager Frank Cashen. When the Mets struggled early in the 1990 season, starting the season 20–22, he was fired. He finished with a record of 595 wins and 417 losses in the regular season and 11 wins and nine losses in the post-season. He remains the winningest manager in Mets history and was inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame with Frank Cashen, Darryl Strawberry, and Dwight Gooden on August 1, 2010.

===Cincinnati Reds===
After more than two seasons out of baseball, the Cincinnati Reds hired Johnson 44 games into the 1993 season. As was the case with the Mets, Johnson revived the Reds almost immediately. He led the team to the National League Central lead at the time of the 1994 players&#x27; strike and won the first official NL Central title in 1995. However, early in the 1995 season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced Johnson would not return in 1996, regardless of how the Reds did. Schott named former Reds third baseman Ray Knight (who had played for Johnson on the Mets championship team) as bench coach, with the understanding that he would take over as manager in 1996.

Johnson and Schott had never gotten along, and relations had deteriorated to the point that he had nearly been fired after the 1994 season. According to Johnson, Schott would even send notes to him that were addressed to him by her St. Bernard. By most accounts, the final straw came because Schott did not approve of Johnson living with his fiancée Susan before they were married (the two met in 1993 and married a year later). According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Schott had decided before the 1995 season even started that it would be Johnson&#x27;s last one in Cincinnati. The Reds defeated the Dodgers in the NLDS and reached the NLCS in Johnson&#x27;s last season as the Reds&#x27; manager, being swept by the eventual World Series champion Atlanta Braves. Johnson finished with a record of 204 wins and 172 losses in the regular season and three wins and four losses in the post-season.

===Baltimore Orioles===
In 1996, Johnson returned to Baltimore as the Orioles&#x27; manager on a three-year, $2.25 million contract. The Orioles had gone 71–73 the previous year, but the team had promising talent to go with future Hall of Famers Cal Ripken Jr., Mike Mussina, Eddie Murray, and Roberto Alomar. The team went 88–74, finishing four games behind the New York Yankees in the AL East but it was good enough for the Wild Card by three games. It was the Orioles&#x27; first trip to the postseason since winning the 1983 World Series. The Orioles met the Cleveland Indians in the Division Series, the defending champion of the American League who had won 99 games, the best in the majors that season. The Orioles won the first two games before Cleveland forced a Game 4 with a win, and they were one inning away from forcing another one before the Orioles rallied with an Alomar two-out RBI single, and he gave them the lead in the 12th on a home run that delivered Baltimore to the Championship Series against the New York Yankees. The Orioles were leading Game 1 4–3 in the eighth inning before a fly ball hit by Derek Jeter was illegally caught over the fence by a fan over the hands of Tony Tarasco that tied the game. The Yankees won the game in the eleventh inning. While the Orioles rebounded to win Game 2, the Yankees then won the next three.

The Orioles did even better in the following season, as they went 98–64 to finish with the best record in the American League while retaining the key core from before (albeit with the loss of Murray while acquiring future Hall of Famer Harold Baines mid-season). In the Division Series, they faced the Seattle Mariners. The Orioles won the series in four games, as they routed the Mariners with 23 runs while allowing just 11. They met the Cleveland Indians in the Championship Series, who had upset the Yankees. The Orioles lost in a heartbreaker of a playoff series, however. All four losses in the series to the Indians were by one run, with two of them happening in extra innings (Game 3, for example, was lost on an alleged missed call of a foul tipped bunt). The Orioles outscored Cleveland 19–18 and out-hit them 54–40, but the Indians prevailed in Game 6 to advance to the World Series.

However, Johnson and Orioles owner Peter Angelos never got along. In fact, the two men almost never spoke to each other. The end reportedly came when Johnson fined Roberto Alomar for skipping a team banquet in April 1997 and an exhibition game against the AAA Rochester Red Wings during the 1997 All-Star Break. Johnson ordered Alomar to pay the fine by making out a check to a charity for which his wife served as a fundraiser. However, Alomar donated the money to another charity after players&#x27; union lawyers advised him of the possible conflict of interest. In negotiations after the season, Angelos let it be known that he considered Johnson&#x27;s handling of the Alomar fine to be grossly inappropriate, enough to be a firing offense. Johnson was prepared to admit he had made an error in judgment regarding the fine, but Angelos demanded Johnson admit he had acted recklessly in not leaving the decision to him. Presumably, such an admission would have given Angelos grounds to fire Johnson for cause. Johnson refused to do so. Johnson had doubts over whether he would return for the final year of his contract (saying as much eight days after the Orioles had lost on October 15), and a spirited 90-minute phone call between Johnson and Angelos a week later was the last time they spoke to each other. He offered his resignation by fax (after failing to reach Angelos by phone), which Angelos accepted on the same day that Johnson was named American League Manager of the Year on November 5. Johnson did not express bitterness with his time in Baltimore, although Angelos released the text of his response letter to the resignation, stating that Johnson&#x27;s letter &quot;fails to recognize the real issue posed by your imposition and handling of the Alomar fine and your divisive statement to the press in July that unless the Orioles got to the World Series, you would not be permitted to return ... Your own actions and conduct, not mine, have produced the fulfillment of your prophecy.&quot;

The Orioles promoted pitching coach in Ray Miller (who Angelos had hired after ordering Pat Dobson to be removed after the 1996 season), but the team would not have another winning season, let alone garner a postseason berth, until 2012. As Orioles manager, Johnson logged a winning percentage of .574.
===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Johnson had interviewed with the Toronto Blue Jays after the 1997 season but wasn&#x27;t hired. Two years later, he returned to the majors as manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had won 88 games the previous year. On May 3, he won his 1,000th game as manager, doing so with a 7–0 victory over the Montreal Expos. Johnson did so in his 1,740th game as manager. No manager reached the 1,000 wins plateau nearly as fast as Johnson until Joe Girardi (1,808) in 2020. Johnson suffered the only full losing season of his managerial career, finishing in third place eight games under .500 with 77 wins. While the Dodgers rebounded to second place the next year, it was not enough to save Johnson&#x27;s job. He finished with a record of 163 wins and 161 losses despite having high-priced talent, such as Kevin Brown and Gary Sheffield (alongside growing talent in future Hall of Famer Adrian Beltre) by general manager Kevin Malone.

===Olympics and Team USA===
Johnson briefly managed the Netherlands national team in 2003 during the absence of Robert Eenhoorn, then served as a bench coach under Eenhoorn at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He had a ruptured appendix that had to have multiple stomach surgeries after it had gone undiagnosed. He then became manager of Team USA, where he managed the United States team to a seventh-place finish out of an 18-team field in the 2005 Baseball World Cup, held in The Netherlands. The team finished tied for second in its group during group play with a 6–2 record before falling, 11–3, to eventual winner and 24-time World Cup champion Cuba in the quarterfinals. A subsequent 9–0 loss to Nicaragua put the Americans into the seventh-place game with Puerto Rico, where they prevailed with an 11–3 win.

Johnson served as bench coach for Team USA during the 2006 World Baseball Classic, managed Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and managed Team USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In 2009, Johnson was also the head coach for the Florida Collegiate Summer League, DeLand Suns, and returned as the head coach for the 2010 Sanford River Rats season.

===Washington Nationals===

Johnson first joined the Washington Nationals front office on June 7, 2006, when he was appointed as a consultant by vice president/general manager Jim Bowden. He was named a senior advisor to current GM Mike Rizzo after the 2009 campaign. He became the Nationals manager on June 26, 2011, after the unexpected resignation of Jim Riggleman three days earlier. He served as manager for the rest of the 2011 season. The Nationals won eighty total games in that season, which was good enough for a third-place finish, the best finish for the organization since the move to Washington. On October 31, the Nationals announced that Davey Johnson would be their manager for the 2012 season.

On October 1, 2012, Johnson led the Nationals to the franchise&#x27;s first division title since 1981 (when they were the Montreal Expos), eventually achieving a franchise-record 98 wins—the most wins in baseball that year, headlined by rising stars in Stephen Strasburg, Gio Gonzalez, Ian Desmond, and Bryce Harper. However, the team would be without Strasburg for the postseason, as the organization had decreed he would only pitch 160 innings for the whole year (owing to recovering from UCL surgery that limited him in 2011), which he reached in his final start on September 7 (he finished with a 15–6 record and a 3.16 ERA). The Division Series marked the first playoff game in the District of Columbia in 79 years, and they faced the defending champion St. Louis Cardinals. While they won a close opening game, two subsequent blowouts put them on the wall for Game 4, which they won on a walk off home run by Jayson Werth. In Game 5, the Nationals jumped to a 6–0 lead by the third inning, but the lead slowly evaporated over the next five innings to where it was only 7–5 heading into the ninth inning. Drew Storen (who had pitched in the blowout loss in Game 2 and the two subsequent games) was sent to save the ninth inning, but the Cardinals rallied with one out remaining to score four runs to cap a dramatic meltdown for the Nationals. It was the third and final time that Johnson had led a team to the best record in the majors without leading them to the World Series. On November 10, Johnson signed a contract to return as manager of the Nationals for the 2013 season. Three days later, Johnson was named National League Manager of the Year. Johnson noted in his autobiography that just before being awarded the Manager of the Year award, he was offered to sign a document by owner Mark Lerner and GM Mike Rizzo to retire after the 2013 season, as opposed to simply not renewing the contract. At any rate, Johnson called the season a &quot;World Series or bust&quot; year, which came to backfire on him.

The 2013 team struggled after a promising start of winning seven of their first ten games, as they went into the All-Star break with a 48–47 record. Despite having a 18–9 record in the month of September, they finished four games out of a Wild Card berth while finishing second in the NL East with an 86–76 record. On September 29, 2013, Johnson announced his retirement. He had the club record for wins (224) until Dave Martinez passed him in 2021. In 2014, Johnson became a consultant.

Just fifteen managers have finished with a record of 300 or more wins above .500. Johnson finished with a record of 1,372–1,071–2 to finish 301 games above .500 as a manager. In all but one full season as a manager, he won at least 85 games. He is also tenth all time in winning percentage for managers with 1,000 wins. All but Johnson in each category have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, and he has missed induction four times (twice on the Veterans Committee in 2008 and 2010 and twice with Today&#x27;s Game ballot in 2017 and 2018)

===Managerial record===

==Personal life==
Johnson was born in Orlando, Florida. He graduated from Alamo Heights High School in San Antonio, Texas. He also attended the Johns Hopkins University and Texas A&amp;M University, and he graduated from Trinity University in 1964 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics. Johnson is known for taking a statistical approach to baseball that started with his playing career, when he earned the nickname &quot;Dum Dum&quot; for his attempts to advise his pitching teammates to throw for the middle of the plate instead of the corner; he made computer printouts for manager Earl Weaver to use to optimize the lineup, but they were not used. When he became a manager, he pioneered computer-based sabermetrics while managing the Mets.

Johnson met his future wife, Susan, in 1993 (they married the following January) while she was organizing a golf tournament for her deaf-blind son Jake and his learning center (she also specialized in charity for Johns Hopkins Hospital).

Johnson&#x27;s daughter, Andrea, was a nationally ranked amateur surfer in the late 1980s. Andrea died in 2005 from septic shock and complications from schizophrenia. In 2011, his stepson Jake died from pneumonia at the age of 34.

In 2018, he, alongside Erik Sherman, wrote his autobiography &quot;My Wild Ride in Baseball and Beyond&quot;, with the proceeds going to his wife Susan&#x27;s nonprofit organization, Support Our Scholars.

In 2021, Johnson was treated in a hospital after contracting COVID-19, but recovered.

<text>An imidazopyridine is a nitrogen containing heterocycle that is also a class of drugs that contain this same chemical substructure. In general, they are GABAA receptor agonists, however recently proton pump inhibitors, aromatase inhibitors, NSAIDs and other classes of drugs in this class have been developed as well. Despite usually being similar to them in effect, they are not chemically related to benzodiazepines. As such, GABAA-agonizing imidazopyridines, pyrazolopyrimidines, and cyclopyrrones are sometimes grouped together and referred to as &quot;nonbenzodiazepines.&quot; Imidazopyridines include:

== Sedatives ==
Anxiolytics, sedatives and hypnotics (GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators):
* Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines:
** Alpidem (original brand name Ananxyl)—an anxiolytic that was withdrawn from the market worldwide in 1995 due to hepatotoxicity.
** DS-1—a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator selective for the α4β3δ subtype, which is not targeted by other GABAergics such as benzodiazepines or other nonbenzodiazepines.
** Necopidem—an anxiolytic. It has not found clinical use.
** Saripidem—a sedative and anxiolytic. It is not used clinically.
** TP-003—a subtype-selective partial agonist at GABAA receptors, binding to GABAA receptor complexes bearing either α2, α3 or α5 subunits, but only showing significant efficacy at α3.
** Zolpidem (original brand name Ambien)—a widely used hypnotic. Generic versions are widely available.
* Imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines:
** Bamaluzole—a GABAA receptor-agonizing anticonvulsant that was never marketed.

== Antipsychotic ==
Antipsychotics:
* Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines:
** Mosapramine (brand name クレミン, Cremin)—an atypical antipsychotic used in Japan.

== Gastrointestinal ==
Drugs used for peptic ulcer disease (PUD), GERD and gastroprokinetic agents (motility stimulants):
* Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines:
** CJ-033466—an experimental gastroprokinetic acting as a selective 5-HT4 serotonin receptor partial agonist.
** Zolimidine—a gastroprotective agent.
** Linaprazan—a potassium-competitive acid blocker which demonstrated similar efficacy as esomeprazole in healing and controlling symptoms of GERD patients with erosive esophagitis.
** SCH28080—the prototypical potassium-competitive acid blocker which has not found clinical use because of liver toxicity in animal trials and elevated liver enzyme activity in the serum of human volunteers.
* Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines:
** Tenatoprazole—it blocks the gastric proton pump leading to decline of gastric acid production.

== Anti-inflammatories ==
NSAIDs, analgesics and antimigraine drugs:
* Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines:
** Miroprofen—a derivative of propionic acid.
* Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines:
** Telcagepant—a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist which was in clinical trials as a remedy for migraine. Its development was terminated.

== Cardiovascular ==
Drugs acting on the cardiovascular system:
* Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines:
** Olprinone (loprinone)—a cardiac stimulant.

== Bone ==
Drugs for treatment of bone diseases:
* Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines:
** Minodronic acid (brand names Bonoteo, Recalbon)—a third-generation bisphosphonate used for the treatment of osteoporosis.

== Antineoplastic ==
Antineoplastic agents:
* Imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines:
** Fadrozole (brand name Afema)—an aromatase inhibitor.
* Imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines:
** 3-Deazaneplanocin A—an &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl--homocysteine synthesis inhibitor and histone methyltransferase EZH2 inhibitor.

== Antiviral ==
Directly-acting antiviral agents:

* Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines:
** Tegobuvir (GS-9190) - an allosteric, non-nucleoside hepatitis C virus NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor targeting the thumb II allosteric site.
==DAergic==
*PIP3EA [885446-91-3] D4 agonist, shown to induce penile erection in rats.

<text>Yang Jianli (born Lanling County, Linyi, southern Shandong, China, August 15, 1963) is a Chinese dissident with a United States residency. He is the son of a Communist Party leader. Yang was detained in China in 2002 and was released in 2007. He now lives in the United States, where he is a human rights activist.

==Early life==
Yang, a Tiananmen Square activist in 1989, came to the United States, earned two Ph.D.s (Ph.D., Political Economy, Harvard University and Ph.D. Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley), and then founded the &quot;Foundation for China in the 21st Century&quot;. He was blacklisted by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which also refused to renew his passport, because of his political activism.

==Imprisonment==
Yang returned to China in April 2002 on a friend&#x27;s passport to view labor unrest in northeast China. He was detained when trying to board a domestic flight, and held incommunicado by the Chinese in violation of their own and international law. His wife and children, as well as his extended family, were denied access and were concerned for his health and safety while he was in prison. The advocacy group Freedom Now took up his case.

=== International reactions ===
On May 28, 2003, a United Nations working group on arbitrary detention ruled that Yang Jianli had been held by the Chinese government in violation of international law. On June 25, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed H.Res.199 and the U.S. Senate introduced S.Res.184.

On August 4, 2003, the United States called on China to release Yang. &quot;We&#x27;ve raised the case repeatedly with senior Chinese officials, and we urge that Dr. Yang be released and allowed to return to his family here in the United States,&quot; US State Department deputy spokesman Philip Reeker said.

=== Petitioning by lawmakers and academics ===
On December 8, 2003, a letter from Harvard University Law School with 29 faculty signatures was sent via FedEx to Wen Jiabao through the Chinese Embassy. Two days later, letters from Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government and Medical School with 78 faculty signatures were sent to Wen Jiabao via the same methods.

On April 26, 2004, members of Congress held a press conference to commemorate the second anniversary of Yang&#x27;s detention. 67 legislators issued a warning in a letter to Hu as they marked the second year in detention of Yang Jianli. Citing Vice President Dick Cheney, Republican Party lawmaker Christopher Cox said meanwhile that the US embassy in Beijing spoke directly with the Chinese government about Yang&#x27;s case.

On May 13, 2004, the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People&#x27;s Court returned a guilty verdict and sentenced Yang to five years in prison for espionage and illegal entry.

A few months later, on October 6, 21 U.S. senators and 85 U.S. representatives wrote a petition to Hu Jintao to grant Yang parole. On June 15, 2005, a bipartisan group of 40 U.S. senators (including Jon Kyl, Barbara Mikulski, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Ted Kennedy, and Bob Dole) sent a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao urging Yang&#x27;s release.

On April 10, 2006, 119 US lawmakers urged Bush to raise Yang Jianli&#x27;s case. Later, on September 3, Yang Jianli was released on the condition that he leave China immediately. However, Yang first insisted on returning to his hometown to sweep his father&#x27;s tomb. As a result, he was once again imprisoned while at the airport.

==Return to the United States==

On April 27, 2007, Yang was released from Chinese prison but was not allowed to leave China. Later, on August 19, he was finally allowed to return to the United States.

Reminded of his experience with the June 4, Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 for freedom of speech and democracy, Yang&#x27;s recent article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; shortly after his return to the United States reflects his vivid observation of the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests, spiritually coined as Saffron Revolution, including China&#x27;s &#x27;parasitic relationship with Burma&#x27; and the genuine will of freedom-loving intellectuals around the world condemning the current brutal oppressions in Burma.

In March 2016, together with Fang Zheng and Zhou Fengsuo, Yang published an op-ed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; protesting Donald Trump&#x27;s characterization of the Tiananmen Square Massacre as the act of a &quot;strong, powerful government&quot;.

He has been a guest speaker at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy on several occasions, and is the founder of the NGO, &quot;Initiatives for China&quot;, a US-based organisation dedicated to working for a peaceful transition to democracy in China. He also established the &quot;Foundation for China in the 21st Century&quot;.

In 2016, he organised an Interfaith Conference of China&#x27;s ethnic and religious minorities in Dharamshala, India, which is home to the Dalai Lama&#x27;s residence and the headquarters of the Central Tibetan Administration (the Tibetan government in exile). The conference has brought together representatives of the Uyghurs, Mongolians, Christians, Falun Gong; and the people of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.

In June 2016, Yang organised an event in Washington D.C. to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in China. Its technical systems were hacked, so that some participants in other countries could not fully communicate.

In March 2018, Yang was invited to speak by the advocacy group UN Watch at the UN Human Rights Council but Chinese diplomat Chen Cheng repeatedly interrupted in a failed attempt to halt the address. In his talk, Yang questioned the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s right to represent China at the United Nations and criticized its human rights abuses.

In 2020, Yang applied for United States citizenship but was rejected due to his former membership in the Chinese Communist Party. In response, Yang sued the federal government, which agreed to make him eligible to apply for citizenship again in four years.

Yang is a primary target of the Chinese government&#x27;s disinformation networks.

<doc id="652905" wikidata="Q3473598" url="?curid=652905" title="Curlew, Washington">
<text>Curlew is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in northwestern Ferry County, Washington, United States, between Malo and Danville on State Route 21. The BNSF Railway ran through the town. The historic Ansorge Hotel is located in Curlew. As of the 2010 census, the population of the community was 118. The settlement is named for the curlew birds once prevalent in the area.

==Geography==
Curlew is located at the confluence of Long Alec Creek and the Kettle River. Its elevation is above sea level. Via State Route 21, it is north of Republic, the Ferry County seat, and south of the Canadian border.

One of the most popular sites on the Kettle River in summer is &quot;the Old Swimming Hole&quot; near the center of town. Curlew was a pick-up point for moonshine that was dropped in the Kettle River. The tradition is still celebrated on the first Sunday in June each year during the Curlew Barrel Derby Days. A barrel is set adrift in the Kettle River at the Job Corps Bridge, and local citizens bet on when it will reach town.

==History==

===Early community===
In 1896, two traders, Guy S. Helphry and J. Walters, set up a general store at an old ferry crossing near the junction of Curlew Creek and the Kettle River. The site around the store grew into a collection of log buildings and other stores. In 1898, a post office was established and the town was named &quot;Curlew&quot;. Miners, railroad workers, natives, and others passed through the region and by 1901, a bridge was built across the Kettle River and the community had grown to a population of 200. Nearby mines such as Drummer, Lancaster and Panama grew. Curlew&#x27;s population and expansion peaked at this time, and the town contained two general stores, two saloons, a hotel, two livery stables, a dry goods store and several other businesses. 

The Curlew Air Force Station, part of the network of Air Defense Command radar stations, was near the area and was operational in the 1950s. , the radar site no longer exists, and the base, northwest of Curlew up the Kettle River valley, is in use by Job Corps.

===Railroad expansion===
In fall 1901, the Republic and Kettle Valley Railway (operating as the Kettle Valley Lines) (KVL), and Washington and Great Northern Railway (W&amp;GN) (operating as the
Spokane Falls and Northern Railway subsidiary of the Great Northern Railway) (GN) were building competing Grand Forks (BC)–Curlew–Republic (WA) lines. About a mile north of Curlew, the KVL grade passed over the GN one. In January 1902, GN construction crews were unsuccessful in pulling down the KVL trestlework that crossed the GN track. Law enforcement officers diffused a series of subsequent confrontations.

KVL, which began the Grand Forks–Curlew–St. Peter&#x27;s Creek passenger service in March 1902, extended the line to five or six miles north of Republic in April, and held a symbolic last spike ceremony. That July, the GN Marcus (WA)–Grand Forks–Curlew–Republic passenger service began. GN began Curlew–Midway (BC) passenger service in December 1905.

===Railroad demise===
In 1919, the KVL became insolvent, and all services are believed to have ceased that year, and the track was subsequently abandoned. In 1935, GN abandoned Curlew–Molson. In 2006, the Kettle Falls International Railway, the GN successor, abandoned the 28.5-mile San Poil–Danville section, ending all railroad service to Curlew.

<text>Front Mission 3, also known in Japan as is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation. It was released in Japan in 1999, and North America by Square Electronic Arts and Europe in 2000. &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; is the third main entry and the fifth entry overall in the &quot;Front Mission&quot; series. Like other &quot;Front Mission&quot; titles, &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; is part of a serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their struggles involving mecha known as &quot;wanzers&quot;.

&quot;Front Mission 3&quot; was the first title in the &quot;Front Mission&quot; series to be released in North America, Europe and Australia.

A remake for the Nintendo Switch, titled &quot;Front Mission 3: Remake&quot;, was announced in September 2022.

==Gameplay==

The mechanics of &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; are a radical departure from &quot;Front Mission&quot; and &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;. While it is a tactical role-playing game, there is a stronger emphasis on role-playing elements as opposed to strategic elements in &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. New to &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; is the Double Feature Scenario – this allows the player to experience two different scenarios that exist independently of one another within the game&#x27;s storyline. In other words, the player can play through two stories; while they may share common events and environments, the stories are largely unique and in essence are fully-fledged games.

&quot;Front Mission 3&quot; missions are traditional tactical RPG fare, ranging from destroying all enemy targets to protecting a certain allied target. Where the game differs significantly from its predecessors lies mainly through a new combat feature – the ability to attack the pilots themselves. During any attack, the pilot can be damaged or forcefully ejected from their machines. The player can also have a pilot eject from their unit to fight on foot, or hijack another machine on the battlefield. The game also changes how skills are learned; instead of gaining experience to improve a pilot&#x27;s proficiencies, they are now learned by equipping wanzer parts and using them in battle. When certain conditions are met, there is a random chance that a pilot may learn a new skill from one of their wanzer parts, which can be programmed into the wanzer&#x27;s battle computer. Many gameplay features from &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; have also been removed, greatly simplifying the overall structure of mission play. Missions are now much smaller in scale, limiting the amount of strategic options the player can use.

There are some returning features from &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; that are used for mission play though, namely Action Points (AP) and Links. Action Points (AP) is a feature that dictates how much can be done with each unit. Actions such as moving and attacking require a certain amount of AP to use. At the end of a full turn, which is one Player Phase and Enemy Phase, a set amount of AP is replenished. A unit&#x27;s AP amount value depends on how many combat ranks its pilot has earned; these are earned by destroying enemy units. Links is a unique ability that allows multiple units to provide offensive support to each other during Player Phase battles. Links operates differently in &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;; a unit&#x27;s pilot must have a Link-class skill and the appropriate weapons (which also acts as their linked actions) equipped. Once this condition is met, a linked battle will commence if the skill activates. Up to three units can be linked together to form one &quot;link&quot;.

Other returning features that appear in mission play include mission rankings and mission branching. As in Front Mission Alternative, players are graded on how well or poorly they clear missions. While there are incentives to perform well, the game does not reward the player with new parts or weapons as it did in &quot;Alternative&quot;. Mission branching returns and now allow players to choose what type of mission to play next. Aside from these, the Network feature from &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; returns and is greatly expanded upon. Players can now browse through the pseudo-Internet, send and receive e-mail messages, tinker with online files and wallpapers, or use the new Battle Simulator feature. The Battle Simulator is a game mode where the player can participate in VR training exercises. These drills can be used to increase the fighting proficiencies of the player&#x27;s pilots and can be taken as many times as needed. Lastly, players can strengthen their parts with the return of the remodeling feature. Through this, the player can augment a wanzer&#x27;s armor coating (known as &quot;Def-C&quot;), the accuracy of its weapons, increase its jumping power to scale buildings, or equip it with rollers to dash on flat surfaces quickly.

==Story==
Set in October 2112, the story of &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; takes place in Southeast Asia, revolving around the cold war between the Oceania Cooperative Union (OCU) and the People&#x27;s Republic of Da Han Zhong (DHZ). Since the People&#x27;s Republic of Alordesh won their independence from the O.C.U. in 2102, member-states within the union also formed their own separatist movements. Countries such as Indonesia and Singapore began voicing their anti-OCU sentiments, both through peaceful and non-peaceful means. In 2106, pro-nationalist forces in the Philippines wage war on the government and their OCU handlers. Desperate to maintain stability in the region, the O.C.U. Central Parliament allows the United States of the New Continent (USN) to send in peacekeeping forces to resolve these conflicts. Eventually, the supranational union is pushed to the breaking point in 2112 when a mysterious explosion occurs at a Japanese Defense Force (JDF) base in Japan.

===Plot===
There are two plots of &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;, and both revolve around Japanese wanzer test pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama. Through a decision made early in the game, the player can play either the DHZ scenario or the USN scenario. The DHZ scenario stars Japanese scientist Aliciana &quot;Alisa&quot; Takemura, while the USN scenario revolves around scientist Emir &quot;Emma&quot; Klamsky.

Although both scenarios have different characters and story scenarios, they both share a number of events and locations in the game. Due to its storytelling approach, it is not known which of the two scenarios is canonically related to &quot;Front Mission 5: Scars of the War&quot;. On October 31, Kazuki begins testing a new prototype wanzer at a Kirishima Heavy Industries test site near Okinawa. Upon completing the test, he is informed that some construction wanzers need to be taken to the JDF base in Yokosuka. Ryogo asks Kazuki if he can join him in delivering the wanzers. If the player chooses to go with him, they will play the USN scenario. If the player does not go with him, they will play the DHZ scenario.

In either case, Kazuki and Ryogo are eventually tasked to deliver the Kirishima prototypes to the Yokosuka base. As they ready the wanzers for delivery, an explosion leads Kazuki to attempt going inside the base itself. The two test pilots are eventually forced to leave the base. Realizing that his sister Alisa was recently transferred to the base, Kazuki and Ryogo eventually find themselves back inside the complex.

The two are then forced to escape the base and their JDF pursuers under different circumstances. On the USN scenario, Kazuki and Ryogo are aided by Emir with help from her USN allies. On the DHZ scenario, DHZ agent Liu Hei Fong saves the two and Alisa from being captured. In either case, Takemura and Kusama are blamed as terrorists behind the Yokosuka base attack. Wondering why they are being chased, Emma or Liu tells the two that the JDF stole a top-secret USN weapon called MIDAS from a base in Alaska, and that the explosion came from a failed attempt to reproduce it. The raid itself, which is in the game&#x27;s opening cutscene, is viewed in &quot;Scars of the War&quot; as security camera footage.

The group pursues MIDAS to an OCU base hidden inside Taal Volcano in the Philippines, but the OCU uses it against a DHZ-aided rebel force conducting an amphibious landing in Batangas City. With MIDAS apparently gone for good, the group moves to the DHZ where they become involved in the government&#x27;s battle against the USN-aided Hua Lian Rebels.

As the battle escalates, the group encounters the &quot;Imaginary Numbers&quot; and &quot;Real Numbers,&quot; the results of a genetic engineering program intended to create the perfect human. Developed in Ravnui (formerly Belarus), Bal Gorbovsky, the head of the program, had secretly continued his work with the DHZ government masquerading as the Ravnui Ambassador. However, the Imaginary Numbers turn on Bal and reveal that the MIDAS used in the Philippines was a successful duplicate. Their leader, Lukav Minaev, also reveals that Emir and Alisa were also both created by the project, and that two scientists who adopted them as family helped them escape before they were killed.

The Imaginary Numbers flee to Japan where they support a coup d&#x27;état hatched by Masao Sasaki, the ultra-nationalist JDF Chief of Staff who ordered the Alaska raid. Kazuki&#x27;s group follows them to Japan, where he is reunited with his estranged father Isao Takemura. They manage to defeat the coup forces, clear their names and pursue the Imaginary Numbers back to Ocean City, a floating island located off Okinawa. Although they finally defeat the Imaginary Numbers and safely detonate the original MIDAS out at sea, the game&#x27;s ending will either be resolved or left ambiguous depending on the scenario chosen.

==Development and release==
&quot;Front Mission 3&quot; was developed by Development Division 6 of Square, led by Toshirou Tsuchida. It was the fifth entry in the series after the two mainline entries and two spin-off titles. &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; was the first game produced in-house by Square, who had bought out and incorporated original developer G-Craft. Production lasted two years, with the team using their experience creating &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; for the PlayStation to polish and improve on the gameplay experience. Akihiro Yamada acted as one of the game&#x27;s artists. During production, several different characters went through multiple drafts, and some characters and concepts needed to be dropped. Kiyotaka Akaza acted as one of the programmers, while Ko Sato designed the battle system. As with other entries in the &quot;Front Mission&quot; series, the team consciously drew their inspirations from sources other than traditional mecha anime and manga. Its North American release was the first &quot;Front Mission&quot; title to release outside Japan.

===Audio===

The game&#x27;s musical score, &quot;Front Mission 3 Original Soundtrack&quot;, was composed and arranged by Koji Hayama, Hayato Matsuo, and SHIGEKI. It was produced by Hayama and Matsuo. The soundtrack was released on September 22, 1999, by DigiCube and has not had a re-release since. It bears the catalog number &quot;SSCX-10035&quot;.

Hayama and Matsuo split the composition of the soundtrack, with the former composing 20 tracks and the latter 26 tracks, respectively. SHIGEKI has a sole contribution, the first track of disc one.

==Reception==
The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 32 out of 40.

Yukiyoshi Ike Sato of &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted that the Japanese version may be a title worth introducing the franchise to American audiences, but criticized its graphics for being a notch lower than &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;. Sam Bishop of &quot;IGN&quot; lauded the game&#x27;s battle mechanics as rare in other Square installments since &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, but cited the graphics transitions between overhead play and individual battles as spotty. Derek Williams of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it four stars out of five and said, &quot;&quot;Front Mission 3&quot;″s deep, strategic gameplay makes up for most any of the flaws. Chances are you&#x27;ll be having so much fun with the strategic combat that you may not even pay attention to the story, or find yourself booting up the combat simulator more often than you advance the plot.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; praised the missions for their varied objectives and special events, but criticized the game&#x27;s limited tactical possibilities, giving it six out of ten and stating that &quot;there&#x27;s none of the learning progression of wargames that gradually release more sophisticated units and abilities, so it&#x27;s simply a matter of grasping the basics and applying them over and over.&quot; Adam Pavlacka of &quot;NextGen&quot; called it &quot;A solid game with some engaging RPG elements. Worth your time if you find the idea of realtime strategy exhausting.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; summed up the review by saying, &quot;Even if you&#x27;re not a fan of the genre, &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; is sure to attract RPG and strategy enthusiasts alike.&quot;

The game sold 298,342 units in Japan the year of its release.

It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Strategy Game&quot; award among console games, losing to &quot;Ogre Battle 64&quot;.

&quot;Front Mission 3&quot; has been re-released a number of times in Japan. In 2000, the game re-released as part of Square&#x27;s Millennium Collection, and included collectable goods such as a keychain penlight, key fobs, and a wallet and chain. In 2002, the game was re-issued as part of Sony&#x27;s PSone Books line of best-sellers. The game was also packaged with both &quot;Front Mission&quot; and &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; as part of the &quot;Front Mission History&quot; compilation in 2003. Finally, the game was re-released in 2006 as part of Square Enix&#x27;s Ultimate Hits line. The game was re-released on the European PSN in September 2010 and on the North American PSN in December 2010.

<text>Katherine Vandam Bornstein (born March 15, 1948) is an American author, playwright, performance artist, actor, and gender theorist. In 1986, Bornstein started identifying as gender non-conforming and has stated &quot;I don&#x27;t call myself a woman, I know I&#x27;m not a man&quot; after having been assigned male at birth and receiving sex reassignment surgery. Bornstein now identifies as non-binary and uses the pronouns they/them and she/her. Bornstein has also written about having anorexia, being a survivor of PTSD, and being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Bornstein grew up just outside of Asbury Park, New Jersey, in an upper middle-class Conservative Jewish family of Russian and Dutch descent. Bornstein studied Theater Arts with John Emigh and Jim Barnhill at Brown University (Class of &#x27;69). Bornstein joined the Church of Scientology, becoming a high-ranking lieutenant in the Sea Org, but later became disillusioned and formally left the movement in 1981. Bornstein&#x27;s antagonism toward Scientology and public split from the church have had personal consequences; Bornstein&#x27;s daughter, herself a Scientologist, no longer has any contact per Scientology&#x27;s policy of disconnection.

=== Transition and post-op ===
Bornstein never felt comfortable with the belief of the day that all trans women are &quot;women trapped in men&#x27;s bodies.&quot; Bornstein did not identify as a man, but the only other option was to be a woman, a reflection of the gender binary, which required people to identify according to only two available genders. Another obstacle was the fact that Bornstein was attracted to women. She had sex reassignment surgery in 1986.

Bornstein settled into the lesbian community in San Francisco, and wrote art reviews for the gay and lesbian paper &quot;The Bay Area Reporter&quot;. Over the next few years, they began to identify as neither a man nor a woman. This catapulted Bornstein back to performing, creating several performance pieces, some of them one-person shows. It was the only way that she knew how to communicate life&#x27;s paradoxes.

Bornstein also teaches workshops and has published several gender theory books and a novel. &quot;Hello Cruel World&quot; was written to keep &quot;teens, freaks, and other outlaws&quot; from dying by suicide. &quot;Do whatever it takes to make your life more worth living,&quot; Bornstein writes, &quot;just don&#x27;t be mean.&quot; In a May 2018 interview with the LGBTQ&amp;A podcast, they said that they no longer have thoughts of suicide since writing the book. 

Bornstein&#x27;s partner is Barbara Carrellas. They live in New York City with three cats, two dogs, and a turtle.

=== Cancer diagnosis ===
In August 2012, Bornstein was diagnosed with lung cancer. Doctors thought Kate was cancer-free after surgery, but it emerged in February 2013 that the disease had returned. Laura Vogel, a friend of Kate&#x27;s, launched a GoFundMe campaign on March 20 to help fund the cancer treatment. In December 2015, Bornstein announced that they had been cancer-free for two years.

=== Later years ===
Bornstein made their Broadway debut in July 2018 in the play &quot;Straight White Men&quot;.

Speaking to the LGBTQ&amp;A podcast in July 2021, Bornstein talked about how her view of gender evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Gender became inconsequential to me while I was in quarantine and grappling with old age...This is where you really need to be letting go of shit. I&#x27;m letting go of the ability to be cute, in certain ways. I&#x27;m too old for that. My face is sagging, my boobs are sagging. Boy, oh boy. They&#x27;re down to my waist and you let go of that as being necessary to your gender.&quot;

== Works ==
In 1989, Bornstein created a theatre production in collaboration with Noreen Barnes, &quot;Hidden: A Gender&quot;, based on parallels between their own life and that of the intersex person Herculine Barbin, starring Bornstein and Justin Vivian Bond. In 2009, Bornstein&#x27;s &quot;Hello, Cruel World: 101 Alternatives to Suicide for Teens, Freaks, and Other Outlaws&quot; was a Lambda Literary Award Finalist for LGBT Nonfiction and Honorbook for the Stonewall Children&#x27;s and Young Adult Literature. Bornstein edited &quot;Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation&quot; in collaboration with S. Bear Bergman. The anthology won Lambda Literary and Publishing Triangle Awards in 2011. Bornstein&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;A Queer and Pleasant Danger: A Memoir&quot;, was released May 2012, and in April 2013, they released &quot;My New Gender Workbook: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving World Peace Through Gender Anarchy and Sex Positivity&quot;. Recently, Bornstein has taken part in a theatrical tour in England. She also took part in being a cast member in the reality TV show of I Am Cait.

<text>Franny &quot;and&quot; Zooey is a book by American author J. D. Salinger which comprises his short story &quot;Franny&quot; and novella &quot;Zooey&quot; . The two works were published together as a book in 1961, having originally appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1955 and 1957 respectively. The book focuses on siblings Franny and Zooey, the two youngest members of the Glass family, which was a frequent focus of Salinger&#x27;s writings.

&quot;Franny&quot; tells the story of Franny Glass, Zooey&#x27;s sister, a college student. The story takes place in an unnamed college town during Franny&#x27;s weekend visit to her boyfriend Lane. Disenchanted with the selfishness and inauthenticity she perceives all around her, she aims to escape it through spiritual means.

&quot;Zooey&quot; is set shortly after the events of &quot;Franny&quot; in the Glass family apartment in New York City&#x27;s Upper East Side. While actor Zooey&#x27;s younger sister Franny suffers a spiritual and existential breakdown in their parents&#x27; Manhattan living room, leaving their mother Bessie deeply concerned, Zooey comes to Franny&#x27;s aid, offering what he thinks is brotherly love, understanding, and words of sage advice.
==Plot summary==

===&quot;Franny&quot;===
The short story concerns Franny&#x27;s weekend date with her collegiate boyfriend, Lane Coutell. Lane takes her to a fashionable lunch room, where Franny quickly becomes exasperated when he appears interested only in conversing about the minutiae of his academic frustrations. Franny questions the importance of college education and the worth of Lane&#x27;s friends. She eats nothing, feels faint, and becomes progressively more uncomfortable talking to Lane. Eventually, she excuses herself to visit the restroom, where, after a nervous breakdown, she regains her composure.

Franny returns to the table, where she expresses her feeling of being troubled with egotism and the need to be accomplished. Lane then spots the small book that Franny has been carrying and asks her about it. She explains that the book is titled &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot; and tells the story of how a Russian wanderer learns the power of &quot;praying without ceasing&quot;. The Jesus Prayer involves internalizing the prayer &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me&quot; to a point where, in a manner similar to a Zen koan, it becomes unconscious, almost like a heartbeat. Lane is less interested in the story than in keeping their timetable for the party and football game, though when Franny faints due to her mental state, he tends to her and postpones the weekend&#x27;s activities. After she wakes, he goes to call a taxi to take her to her lodging and leaves Franny alone. The story concludes with Franny lying in the restaurant, her lips moving soundlessly, suggesting that she is practising the act of praying without ceasing.

===&quot;Zooey&quot;===
Zooey reads a four-year-old letter from his brother Buddy in the bath in his family&#x27;s home. In the letter, Buddy discusses their eldest brother Seymour&#x27;s suicide several years previously and encourages Zooey to pursue an acting career if he is drawn to it. Zooey&#x27;s mother, Bessie, enters the bathroom, and the two have a long discussion, centering upon Bessie&#x27;s worries about his sister, Franny, who is in a state of emotional collapse and is refusing food. During the conversation, Zooey verbally spars and banters with his mother and repeatedly requests that she leave. Bessie tolerates Zooey&#x27;s behavior, and simply states that he&#x27;s becoming more and more like his brother Buddy and wonders what has happened to her children that were once so &quot;sweet and loving&quot;.

After Bessie leaves, Zooey gets dressed and goes to the living room, where he finds Franny on the sofa with their cat Bloomberg. He begins speaking with her and ends up upsetting Franny by claiming that her motives for reciting the &quot;Jesus Prayer&quot; are rooted in ego reinforcement. Zooey feels guilty and retreats into the former bedroom of Seymour and Buddy, and reads the back of their door, covered in philosophical and religious quotations. After contemplation, Zooey telephones Franny, pretending to be Buddy. Franny eventually discovers the ruse, but she and Zooey continue to talk. Zooey shares with her some words of wisdom that Seymour once gave him, suggesting that one should live with optimism and love because, even if nobody else does, Jesus notices. After Zooey hangs up, Franny lies in their parents&#x27; bed and smiles at the ceiling before eventually falling asleep.

==Major themes==
The story reflects Salinger&#x27;s known interest in Eastern religious philosophies such as Zen Buddhism and Hindu Advaita Vedanta, as well as Eastern Orthodox Christian spirituality. There is also a discussion of whether the book is a &quot;mystical story&quot; or a &quot;love story&quot; in the introduction to the second section, as speculated by the book&#x27;s narrator, Buddy Glass (who decides it&#x27;s the latter). Gerald Rosen, in his 1977 book &quot;Zen in the Art of J. D. Salinger&quot;, observes that &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; could be interpreted as a modern Zen tale, with the main character Franny progressing throughout the short story and novella from a state of ignorance to the deep wisdom of enlightenment. Jennifer Dunn, in an essay, mentioned that the “disparity between bright busy surfaces and inner emptiness” found in &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; can be read as a metaphor for modern society. Carl Bode, in a University of Wisconsin journal, suggested that Salinger, while writing in &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; that “the phoney and the genuine equally deserve our love,” found this as an answer to some of his own emotional problems.

==Original publication==
The book is a reworking from &quot;Ivanoff, the Terrible&quot; (1956).

&quot;Franny&quot; and &quot;Zooey&quot; were originally published separately in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. &quot;Franny&quot; appeared in the magazine in the January 29, 1955 issue, and &quot;Zooey&quot; in the May 4, 1957 issue. Salinger published &quot;Franny&quot; and “Zooey” together as a book in July 1961, through Little, Brown and Company, and dedicated the book to &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor William Shawn.

Since the misconception that Franny was pregnant was nearly universal at the time of original publication (the New Yorker’s editors themselves believed Franny was pregnant), Salinger first edited the text before reconsidering, torn between his annoyance at the notion readers might interpret the story through the lens of a pregnant Franny on one hand, and his reluctance of delivering clear-cut messages on the other. In the end, he made only a single change; having Lane Coutell say &quot;Too goddam long between drinks. To put it crassly,&quot; in the hope this was seen as a reference to sex rather than menstruation. According to the Salinger scholar Warren French, the change was insufficient.

== Reception ==
The book was very popular with the reading public, spending 26 weeks at the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Fiction Best Sellers list in 1961 and 1962, but critics gave it mixed reviews. John Updike felt that Salinger&#x27;s work was more than adequate. He praised Salinger&#x27;s characterizations, writing that they &quot;melt indistinguishably together in an impossible radiance of personal beauty and intelligence&quot;. He also pointed out that Salinger has a &quot;correctly unctuous and apprehensive tone&quot;. However, a few critics thought that Salinger had shamed himself with this particular piece of work. Janet Malcolm quotes Maxwell Geismar who called it an &quot;appallingly bad story&quot;, and George Steiner called it &quot;a piece of shapeless self indulgence&quot;. In 2011, Jay McInerney criticized the creation of the &quot;self satisfied Glass family&quot;, but also stated that the story showed Salinger&#x27;s &quot;evolving beliefs&quot;.

==Adaptations and legacy==
The 1995 Iranian film &quot;Pari&quot; is a loose adaptation of the book.

The book&#x27;s characters inspired much of the child prodigy material present in Wes Anderson&#x27;s 2001 movie &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;.

The book plays a central role in the 2016 film &quot;Carrie Pilby&quot;, as well as in the romance of the protagonists in the 2020 Netflix series &quot;Dash &amp; Lily&quot;.

<text>The Weissach axle is a rear suspension arrangement first used in 1978 in the Porsche 928 and echoed in subsequent production models. The goal of the initial Weissach axle design was to eliminate lift-off oversteer by allowing the rear suspension to adjust itself during cornering manoeuvres and handle both longitudinal and lateral forces. A fully developed version was used in the Porsche 911 (993).

It is named after the town of Weissach (), where a Porsche research and development centre is based. &quot;Weissach&quot; is also a backronym for &quot;Winkel einstellende, selbst stabilisierende Ausgleichs-Charakteristik&quot; (angle-adjusting, self-stabilizing equalization characteristic).

==Design==
The Weissach axle is a variant of the semi-trailing arm suspension design. The tendency of a vehicle to oversteer when decelerating is compounded by the compliant bushings found in most trailing arm suspensions. When the vehicle decelerates, the trailing arms and wheels pivot downwards relative to the chassis. This results in toe out, which makes the vehicle unstable.

In a Weissach axle, the frontmost or outer bushing of each trailing arm is replaced by a short link. When the vehicle decelerates and the trailing arms pivot downwards, the links pull the hubs and cause them to rotate inward slightly; the result is toe in, which adds stability and reduces the risk of oversteer.

==Other manufacturers==
The rear suspension of the second-generation Mazda RX-7 (FC) uses what Mazda refers to as the Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS), which also serves to increase stability at higher cornering loads and when braking.

==Early life==
Omar Epps was born in Brooklyn. His parents divorced during childhood, and he was raised by his mother, Bonnie Maria Epps, an elementary school principal. He lived in several Brooklyn neighborhoods while growing up (Bedford–Stuyvesant, East New York, and East Flatbush). He began writing poetry, short stories, and songs at the age of ten. He attended the prestigious Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, New York City&#x27;s highly selective public high school for students with artistic talent. Before he started acting, he belonged to a rap group called Wolfpack, which he formed with his cousin in 1991.

==Career==
In 1992, Epps made his feature film debut playing a DJ alongside rapper 2Pac as the star of cinematographer Ernest Dickerson&#x27;s directorial film debut &quot;Juice&quot;. The following year, Epps played one of several roles as an athlete, the first as a running back in the college football drama &quot;The Program&quot; alongside James Caan. In 1994, he returned to sports, as co-star of &quot;Major League II&quot;, taking over the role of center fielder Willie Mays Hayes from its originator, Wesley Snipes. His next athletic endeavor was playing a track and field star in John Singleton&#x27;s &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, a look at the politics and racial tensions of college life. Epps led the cast in the 1996 BBC/HBO film &quot;Deadly Voyage&quot;, as a Ghanaian attempting to hide with other stowaways on a major commercial vessel leaving Africa. He won the best actor award at the Monte Carlo Television Festival for portraying Kingsley Ofusu in this true story about the plight of undocumented African stowaways hoping to reach America.
In his network television debut, Epps guest starred as Dr. Dennis Gant, a surgical intern struggling with depression, on the hit medical drama &quot;ER&quot; for several episodes in its third season. After his television work on &quot;ER&quot;, Epps returned to film in 1997 with a role as a giddy moviegoer, on a date with a woman played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who ends up an early victim of a psychopathic slasher in the blockbuster sequel &quot;Scream 2&quot;. Also in 1997, Epps starred in the fact-based HBO movie &quot;First Time Felon&quot; as a small-time criminal who goes through Chicago&#x27;s boot camp reform system and undertakes a heroic flood rescue, only to be faced with the adjustment of re-entering society with the mark of ex-con. In 1999, Epps was cast as Linc in &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;. While &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; proved a critical and box-office bust, Epps&#x27;s later 1999 effort &quot;The Wood&quot; offered him a serious and multi-dimensional role as Mike Tarver, narrator and lead of this critically-acclaimed coming-of-age ensemble comedy. Following a group of middle-class African Americans from youth to adulthood, the debut effort from director-screenwriter Rick Famuyiwa co-starred Richard T. Jones and Taye Diggs. Also in 1999, Epps was featured alongside Stanley Tucci and LL Cool J, playing an undercover detective who finds himself caught up in the illegal goings-on he is investigating in &quot;In Too Deep&quot;. 

In 2000, Epps starred in &quot;Love &amp; Basketball&quot;, featuring Alfre Woodard and Sanaa Lathan. He portrayed Quincy, the NBA hopeful who has a stormy relationship with an equally adept female basketball star Monica, played by Lathan. Epps followed with supporting roles in a wide range of films, including &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, and the telepic &quot;Conviction&quot;. He had a leading role as a gangster in &quot;Brother&quot;, a movie by the celebrated Japanese actor/director Takeshi Kitano.

In 2004, Epps played drug-dealer-turned-prizefighter Luther Shaw who falls under the tutelage of boxing promoter Jackie Kallen (Meg Ryan) in the film biopic &quot;Against the Ropes&quot;. That same year, Epps was a character in the video game &quot;Def Jam Fight for NY&quot;. Epps also returned to a top-rated medical television drama in 2004, with his role as the brilliant neurologist, Dr. Eric Foreman, who stands his ground medically against the routine barbs of the irascible Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) on the award-winning Fox television series &quot;House&quot;. The role in the long-running series earned him an NAACP Image Award in 2007, 2008 and 2013 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. 

In 2014, Epps took on the role of agent J. Martin Bellamy in the ABC television series, &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The series focuses on a number of individuals who return from the dead, and change the lives of their families and friends in Arcadia, Missouri. 

In July 2020, Epps starred in the Netflix psychological thriller &quot;Fatal Affair&quot;. Since 2021, Epps has appeared as Detective Malcolm Howard in the Starz crime drama &quot;Power Book III: Raising Kanan&quot;.

In 2022, it was announced that Epps would star in the Lee Daniels-directed supernatural horror &quot;The Deliverance&quot; alongside Mo&#x27;Nique, Andra Day, Miss Lawrence, and Tasha Smith. The film was released in select theaters and on Netflix in August 2024.

==Personal life==
Epps was in a relationship with costar Sanaa Lathan after both starred in Love and Basketball. They dated from 1999-2001. 

Epps married singer Keisha Spivey, from the R&amp;B group Total, in 2006. They have two children, daughter K&#x27;mari Mae and son Amir. He also has a daughter, Aiyanna, from a previous relationship.

Epps and actor/comedian Marlon Wayans are longtime friends. They met as high school classmates at LaGuardia High, both graduating in 1990. The 1997−1999 theme song used for the sitcom &quot;The Wayans Brothers&quot; was co-produced by Epps, with Marlon and Shawn Wayans.

In a 2018 interview, Epps denied the long-standing rumor that he is related to fellow actor Mike Epps, saying, &quot;Me and Mike Epps ain&#x27;t related, though, we spoke like, &#x27;Where you from? Where you from?&#x27;&quot;

Epps authored an autobiography titled &quot;From Fatherless to Fatherhood&quot; that was released by Lulu Publishing in June 2018.

Epps serves on the Cultural Council of RepresentUs, a nonprofit organization that focuses on passing anti-corruption laws in the United States. In June 2020, he narrated an educational video for the organization about America&#x27;s criminal justice system.

<doc id="652935" wikidata="Q2326854" url="?curid=652935" title="Houghton-le-Spring">
<text>Houghton-le-Spring ( ) is a town in the Sunderland district, in Tyne and Wear, England which has its recorded origins in Norman times. Historically in County Durham, it is now administered as part of the Tyne and Wear county. 

It lies between Durham, southwest and Sunderland, northeast. Seaham is also directly east. The villages and towns of Newbottle, Fencehouses and Hetton-le-Hole lie nearby. It had a population of 36,746.

Other villages within the Houghton-le-Spring postal district include: Philadelphia, Penshaw, Shiney Row, Chilton Moor and Woodstone Village.

==History==
The earliest mention of the town&#x27;s name is in the Boldon Book in 1183 as &#x27;Hoctona&#x27;. An English transcription states:

:&quot;In Houghton are thirteen cottagers, whose tenures, works and payments are like those of Newbotill; and three other half cottagers, who also work like the three half cottagers of Newbotill. Henry the greeve, holds two oxgangs of for his service. The smith – for his service. The carpenter holds a toft and for his service. The punder (one who impounds straying animals) has and the thraves of Houghton, Wardon and Morton; he renders 60 hens and 300 eggs. The mills of Newbotill and Bidic, with half of Raynton Mill, pay XV marks. The demesne, consisting of four carucates and the sheep pastures are in the hands of the lord.&quot;

An ancient document dated 1220 describes the town as &#x27;Houghton Sprynges&#x27;. The name Houghton comes from the Old English &quot;hoh&quot; meaning hill and &quot;tun&quot; meaning settlement.

During excavations under the church of St Michael and All Angels in 2008–09 as part of the church&#x27;s refurbishment, not only were Roman remains discovered but some very ancient stones which suggest that the area has been settled since prehistoric times and that the site of the church has had some religious significance for thousands rather than hundreds of years. Glass inserts in the new floor of the church enable some of these to be seen.
In 1311, the village was owned by Albreda, widow of Sir Henry Spring, hence the addition of &#x27;le spring&#x27;. That explanation of the addition of &#x27;le Spring&#x27; is debatable and there are alternatives. One opinion is that it is derived from the &quot;Le Spring&quot; family, Lords of Houghton in ancient times. Another explanation, which is backed up by a &quot;Regester Booke belonginge to the Paryshe of Houghton in the Springe&quot; from 1598, is based around the medicinal springs which flow from the surrounding limestone rocks. This latter explanation ties in with the Roman names in the area in which &quot;le&quot; is taken to be &quot;in the&quot; as in Chester-le-Street, Witton-le-Wear, Dalton-le-Dale, Hetton-le-Hole. Credence is added to this consideration by the area of the town formerly known as the Lake and the stream/spring that nowadays still runs through the centre of the town, although this has long since been directed to run through a culvert.

The parish church of St Michael and All Angels dates back to Norman times and contains the tomb of Bernard Gilpin, known as &#x27;the Apostle of the North&#x27;. Gilpin was Archdeacon of Durham and in 1557 became the rector at Houghton-le-Spring, which at that time was one of the largest parishes in England.

During World War II, Houghton was relatively unscathed from the German bombing raids, though some fleeing German planes did jettison their loads after bombing attempts on the nearby coastal town of Sunderland.

Houghton was an active coal-mining town. The local mine began to sink its first shaft in 1823 and was active until its closure in 1981. At its peak in the early 20th century, the pit employed over two thousand workers.

==Houghton Feast==

Houghton Feast is an ancient festival held every October in the town. It has its origins in the 12th century as a dedication festival to the parish church of St Michael &amp; All Angels. The festival lasts ten days and typically features a fairground, carnival, fireworks, braying Hettoners and an ox-roasting event in commemoration of Rector Bernard Gilpin&#x27;s feeding of the poor. It was expanded in the 16th century by Gilpin and again in the late 18th century when it became connected with horse racing.

==Today==
Houghton-le-Spring&#x27;s main shopping area is Newbottle Street, with some businesses branching off onto nearby streets for example Mautland Street, Sunderland Street, Church Street and Durham Road. The White Lion pub is the last of four &#x27;Lion&#x27; houses, with the other three having been drastically redeveloped as new businesses or demolished in the 1960s.

Kepier Academy, formerly Kepier School, is the main secondary school serving the town.

<doc id="652936" wikidata="Q4886804" url="?curid=652936" title="Benadryl">
<text>Benadryl is a brand of various antihistamine medications used to stop allergies, whose content varies in different countries, but which includes some combination of diphenhydramine, acrivastine, and/or cetirizine.

It is sold by Kenvue and is used to relieve allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny nose, rash, and hives. Some forms of Benadryl are to be taken orally, while some creams and gels are to be applied to the skin. Common side effects of the drug include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth and throat, confusion, and blurred vision.

In the United States and Canada, the active ingredient is diphenhydramine. In the United Kingdom, the active ingredients of Benadryl are the second-generation antihistamines acrivastine or cetirizine. Benadryl is also sold as a cough medicine in Australia, India and New Zealand containing diphenhydramine, as well as the antitussive dextromethorphan or the expectorant guaifenesin.

== Types of Benadryl ==
There are many different forms of Benadryl found in different countries. In the United States and Canada, there are several versions of Benadryl for allergies, some to be taken orally and some as a topical analgesic. In Australia, New Zealand and India, Benadryl is known as a cough liquid.

=== Benadryl Allergy ===
Benadryl Allergy is the name of a Benadryl product found in the United States and Canada. It is an antihistamine drug used to relieve allergies. Its active ingredient is diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine. It is known to be sedative, making drowsiness a common side effect. It is an oral drug to be taken by mouth, to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever and the common cold. It can also be used to relieve allergies such as itching, sneezing, runny nose, rash and hives.

Benadryl Allergy for Children is also available. It comes in liquid form and can be used to provide fast and effective relief for allergies such as sneezing, itchy, runny nose, itchy eyes and hives.

Benadryl Allergy is widely used as a sleep aid among adults. While it is not marketed as an over-the-counter (OTC) sleeping aid, most versions of Benadryl contain diphenhydramine, a drug with sedative properties. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) has also been used by parents to help improve their infant&#x27;s sleep habits. However, this has been met by criticism on whether it is appropriate to do so.

=== Benadryl Allergy Relief ===
In the United Kingdom, Benadryl can be found as Benadryl Allergy Relief. The main ingredient in this medication is acrivastine. Acrivastine is a non-drowsy antihistamine used to relieve allergies. It can treat hay fever, hives, insect bites and stings, conjunctivitis and eczema. Benadryl Allergy Relief contains 8 mg of acrivastine in each capsule. It is to be taken orally.

Benadryl Allergy Relief Plus Decongestant can also be found in the United Kingdom. It is used to relieve sinus, stuffy and runny nose, itchy eyes and sneezing. This version contains acrivastine and pseudoephedrine as its active ingredients. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant used to relieve a nasal congestion. Benadryl Allergy Relief Plus Decongestant contains 8 mg of acrivastine and 60 mg of pseudoephedrine per capsule, and it is to be taken orally.

=== Benadryl Topical ===
Benadryl can also be found in a topical form including gels and creams. Benadryl Itch Stopping Cream is a topical cream used to provide temporary itch relief for allergies, hives or even some insect bites. It can be found in the United States and Canada. This topical medication contains 2% of diphenhydramine hydrochloride and 1% of zinc acetate. This medication is intended for topical use only and not to be ingested.

=== Benadryl Cough Syrup ===

Benadryl in Australia and New Zealand comes in the form of a cough syrup. It is not to be confused with Benadryl for allergies. There are several forms of cough syrup available in the market for different types of coughs such as dry, tickly cough, chesty coughs and coughs with nasal congestion. Cough liquids for children are also available.

Benadryl Chesty Forte is used to relieve heavy chesty coughs and chest congestion. The main ingredients found are guaifenesin and bromhexine hydrochloride. It is to be taken orally to provide relief from cough and congested chests due to the common cold. Benadryl Dry, Tickly Cough Liquid is a cough medicine found in Australia. It is used to temporarily relieve irritating coughs. Pholcodine is the main ingredient found in this cough liquid. This medication is to be taken orally and may cause drowsiness.

In India, Benadryl can also be found in the form of a cough liquid and also cough lozenges. Benadryl Cough Syrup contains diphenhydramine, ammonium chloride and citrate as its main ingredients. It is used to relieve cough and cold, and also soothes the throat.

== Adverse effects ==
A common side effect of taking Benadryl containing diphenhydramine is drowsiness. Other common side effects can include dry mouth and throat. Symptoms such as confusion and blurred vision can also occur. Other side effects of taking Benadryl include headache and dizziness.

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine and an anticholinergic drug. Anticholinergic drugs block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Studies propose that long-term use of anticholinergic drugs is associated with an increased risk for dementia among older people. Long-term use of Benadryl can also lead to constipation and confusion.

== Interactions ==
Benadryl containing diphenhydramine can interact with alcohol as both are central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Side effects such as drowsiness and dizziness may be enhanced when taking alcohol with diphenhydramine. Mixing diphenhydramine with alcohol can also increase the chances of losing consciousness due to sedation. This combination can also lead to impaired motor skills and decreased alertness. Driving, operating machinery or any other activities that require full concentration and consciousness are not recommended as these effects persist.

Benadryl may interact with other medications such as anti-depressants, sleeping pills, muscle relaxants and other antihistamines. It is important to check with a professional before taking Benadryl with any other medications, vitamins and herbal products.

== History ==
In 1943, diphenhydramine was discovered by chemist George Rieveschl and one of his students, Fred Huber, while they were conducting research into muscle relaxants at the University of Cincinnati. Huber first synthesized diphenhydramine. Rieveschl then worked with Parke-Davis to test the compound, and the company licensed the patent from him.

In 1946, Benadryl was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prescription use. In 1982 it was approved as an over-the-counter medication.

Before 2007, Benadryl was marketed by Pfizer Consumer Healthcare (originally Warner–Lambert).

=== Recalls ===
On 15 January 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, recalled five lots of Benadryl due to the presence of an unusual odor linked to the chemical 2,4,6-tribromoanisole.

In April 2010, over four million packs of Benadryl Children Allergy tablets were recalled after it was revealed that they might contain a higher concentration of active ingredients than specified on the label, as well as inactive ingredients that had not met internal testing requirements.

=== Benadryl Topical Packaging Change ===

In 2010, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported over one hundred cases of mistaken ingestion by mouth, the packaging of Benadryl Itch Stopping Gel was redesigned to include a new warning (&quot;for skin use only&quot;), and a sticker was added as an additional precaution.

== Society and culture ==
Diphenhydramine has a common side effect of drowsiness or sleepiness. Because of these sedative properties, Benadryl is often used as a sleep aid in people with insomnia. A study published in the &quot;American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&quot; discovered that approximately one in three adults between the ages of 65 and 80 occasionally use over-the-counter drugs like Benadryl to help with sleep. In 2017, American Academy of Sleep Medicine discouraged the use of over-the-counter antihistamines as a sleep aid in treating chronic insomnia. The usage of antihistamines as a sleep aid could cause sleepiness during the day, grogginess and falls.

=== Recreational usage and the &#x27;Benadryl challenge&#x27; ===

In May 2020, the Cook Children&#x27;s Medical Center in Fort Worth, TX reported that 3 teenagers had been hospitalized as a result of diphenhydramine overdose. They claimed that the teenagers had gotten information on how to abuse Benadryl from the social media app TikTok. That August, an Oklahoma teen reportedly died from a Benadryl overdose. After a later-deleted Facebook post by the teen&#x27;s family member claimed that the death was the result of a &quot;Benadryl challenge,&quot; news outlets reported on the dangers of the supposed social media trend. This prompted the FDA to release a statement on the dangers of high doses of diphenhydramine.

== Availability ==
Benadryl is available as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug in most countries. Benadryl can be found in several countries including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, India, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Benadryl comes in oral tablets and oral liquid to be taken by mouth. Some types of Benadryl such as Benadryl Itch Stopping Cream and gels are meant to be applied to the skin, not to be ingested.

<doc id="652937" wikidata="Q580556" url="?curid=652937" title="Royal Netherlands Air Force">
<text>The Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF; , &quot;Royal Air Force&quot;) is the military aviation branch of the Netherlands Armed Forces. It was created in 1953 to succeed its predecessor, the &quot;Luchtvaartafdeling&quot; () of the Dutch Army, which was founded in 1913. The aerobatic display team of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, active from 1979 until 2019, was the Solo Display Team.

==History==
The Royal Netherlands Air Force was preceded by the Army Aviation Group (, abbreviation LVA), founded in 1913. It was renamed as Army Aviation Brigade () in 1939. In 1953, it was raised to the level of independent operational part of the Dutch Armed Forces and renamed as Royal Netherlands Air Force ().

===Army Aviation Group===
Dutch air power started on 1 July 1913, with the founding of the Army Aviation Group at Soesterberg airfield () having four pilots. When founded, the Army Aviation Group operated one aircraft, the &quot;Brik&quot;, which was supplemented with three French Farman HF.20 aircraft a few months later. These aircraft were soon outdated, and the Dutch government ordered several fighter/reconnaissance Nieuport and Caudron aircraft to replace them.

====World War I (1914–1918)====
The Netherlands maintained a neutral position during World War I and the Army Aviation Group did not take part in any action. Instead, they focused on developing the force&#x27;s capabilities.

Pilot training was opened and established for ranks including officers in technical, aerial photography, meteorological and navigation flights.

New airfields were built at Arnhem, Gilze-Rijen air base, Venlo and Vlissingen.

Because of the war, it was difficult to procure suitable aircraft. In 1917, the situation changed and their personnel increased to 650.

====Interbellum====
After the end of World War I the Dutch government cut the defence budget and the Army Aviation Group was almost dissolved. As political tensions in Europe increased during the late 1930s the government tried to rebuild the armed forces again in 1938 but there were many problems, not least the shortage of pilot instructors, navigators and pilots to fly the new multiple engine aircraft. Lack of standardisation and resulting maintenance issues added to the complexity of the rebuilding task.

===Army Aviation Brigade===
====World War II====

As war loomed, in July 1939 the Army Aviation Group was renamed the Army Aviation Brigade ().

In August 1939, the Netherlands government mobilised its armed forces, but due to limited budgets the Army Aviation Brigade operated only 176 combat aircraft of the following types:

* 16 Fokker T.V type bombers
* 36 Fokker D.XXI single-engine fighters
* 35 Fokker G.I twin-engine fighters
* 7 Fokker D.XVII single-engine fighters
* 17 Douglas DB-8A-3N light bombers
* 20 Fokker C.X light bombers
* 33 Fokker C.V reconnaissance aircraft
* 20 Koolhoven F.K.51 artillery observer aircraft

In May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands. Within five days the Dutch Army Aviation Brigade was defeated by the Luftwaffe. All of the Brigade&#x27;s bombers, along with 30 D.XXI and 17 G.I fighters were shot down; two D.XXI and eight G.I were destroyed on the ground. Two G.I were captured by German forces, one of which was later flown to England by a Fokker pilot. The Douglas bombers were used as fighters because no suitable bombs were available; these aircraft were poorly suited for this role and eight were shot down and three destroyed on the ground in the first hours of the conflict.

In spite of their numerical superiority the Luftwaffe lost 350 aircraft in the conquest of the Netherlands, many to anti-aircraft fire and crashes at improvised landing fields in the Netherlands rather than due to action by Dutch fighter aircraft. The cost was high – almost 95% of the Dutch pilots were lost. In recognition of their actions Queen Wilhelmina granted the highest Dutch military decoration, the (MWO), to the Army Aviation Brigade collectively.

Some aircrews escaped to England and on 1 June 1940, 320 Squadron and 321 Squadron were established there under RAF operational command. Due to a shortage of personnel, 321 Squadron was absorbed by 320 Sqn in January 1941. Although their personnel were predominantly from the Navy Air Service, Army Aviation aircrew also served with 320 Sqn until the end of the war.

In 1941, the Royal Netherlands Military Flying School was re-established, in the United States at Jackson Field (also known as Hawkins Field), Jackson, Mississippi, operating lend-lease aircraft and training all military aircrew for the Netherlands.

The separate (ML-KNIL; Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Military Air Service) continued in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI), until its occupation by Japan in 1942. Some personnel escaped to Australia and Ceylon. 321 Squadron was re-formed in Ceylon, in March 1942, from Dutch aviators.

In 1942, 18 (NEI) Squadron, a joint Dutch-Australian unit was established, in Canberra, equipped with B-25 Mitchell bombers. It saw action in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), which included the Dutch East Indies. In 1943, 120 (NEI) Squadron was established. Equipped with Kittyhawk fighters, it flew many missions under Australian command, including the recapturing of Dutch New Guinea. In 1944, transport aircraft operated by the KNIL in the SWPA were integrated into another joint unit, 19 (NEI) Squadron.
In June 1943, a Dutch fighter squadron was established in England. 322 (Dutch) Squadron, equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire, saw action as part of the RAF. 322 Sqn aircraft featured the British RAF roundels as well as the Dutch orange triangle. 322 Sqn was successfully deployed against incoming V-1 flying bombs. From mid-1944, during the invasion of Normandy, it executed ground attack missions over France and Belgium.

In July 1944, the Directorate of Netherlands Airpower was established in London.

====Late 1940s and early 1950s====
In 1947, its Chief of Air Force Staff was appointed.

During the Indonesian War of Independence, the air force committed ground attacks and transported material and personnel. In 1948, transportation aircraft were used in support of the first Dutch airborne raid in southern Sumatra and Djokjakarta.

In 1951 several non-combat functions in the Army Aviation were opened to women.

===Royal Netherlands Air Force===
On 27 March 1953 the Royal Netherlands Air Force officially became an independent part of the Dutch armed forces, rather than part of the Army.

The Air Defense Command, (, abbreviated &quot;CLV&quot;) consisting of a command unit, five radar stations and six fighter squadrons, had been established. Its radar equipment as well as its air defense fighters all came from obsolete RAF stocks.

* The Spitfire Mk.IX was used by 322 Squadron RNLAF until 1954 but was replaced as new squadrons were established.
* The Gloster Meteor F Mk.IV was used by 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327 and 328 Squadrons from 1948 to 1957. Bases included Soesterberg and Leeuwarden.
* The Gloster Meteor F Mk.VIII was used by 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327 and 328 sqn from 1951 to 1958.

After the Netherlands joined NATO another new command: Tactical Air Command (, abbreviated &quot;&quot;CTL&quot;) was established.

* CTL consisted of seven new strike squadrons (306, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315 and 316 sqn), all equipped with Republic F-84G Thunderjets. These aircraft were supplied by the United States under the &quot;Mutual Defense Aid Program&quot; from 1952 to 1956. 311 was the first flying squadron to be stood up at Volkel on 1 May 1951.
* 322, 323, 324, 325, 326 and 327 Sqn operated the Hawker Hunter F Mk.4 between 1955 and 1964, and 322, 324, 325 and 326 Sqn operated the Hawker Hunter F Mk.6 between 1957 and 1968.
* 700, 701 and 702 Sqn operated the North American F-86K Sabre all-weather fighter between 1955 and 1964.
* 306, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315 and 316 Sqn changed aircraft configuration from 1955 to 1970 as the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash became available.

====Western New Guinea conflict====
The Indonesian government claimed Western New Guinea following the end of the Second World War. The Dutch government considered the area Dutch territory. Negotiations over the country were conducted for years, but tensions grew until Indonesia broke diplomatic relations with the Netherlands at the end of the 1950s.

In response, in 1958, the Netherlands deployed military reinforcements to New Guinea, including an Air Force detachment for the air defense of the island &quot;Biak&quot; as there was evidence that Indonesia was infiltrating the island in advance of a military operation.

The first Air Force contribution was the installation of two MkIV early warning radars on Biak and Woendi islands.

The political situation between the Netherlands and Indonesia continued to deteriorate and in 1960 the Dutch government deployed reinforcements. The operations were known by name as Plan Fidelio. For the Dutch Air Force this meant the establishment of an Air Defense Command for New Guinea () consisting of:
* One Hawker Hunter Mk.4 air defence squadron.
* A radar navigation system at &quot;Biak&quot;.
* A reserve airstrip at &quot;Noemfoer&quot;.

The Dutch government deployed a squadron consisting of 12 Hawker Hunter Mk.4 AD fighters and two Alouette II SAR helicopters. They were transported to Southeast Asia by the &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;. One year later the Dutch government deployed another 12 Hawker Hunter Mk6 AD fighters; these aircraft carried more fuel and had a larger combat radius.

In August 1962 Indonesia was ready to attack New Guinea. Despite reinforcements the Dutch defences would be insufficient to withstand the coming attack. Therefore, and because of international political pressure the Dutch government was forced to agree to the peaceful surrender of New Guinea. Dutch forces were withdrawn from the territory.

The establishment of 336 transport squadron is closely connected to New Guinea. Soon after activation this unit was deployed to New Guinea to take over air transport from the Dutch Navy. 336 Sqn deployed and took over three Navy Dakotas and three US supplied aircraft. 336 Sqn operated from Mokmer airstrip and transported more than 5,400 passengers between September 1961 and September 1962.

====Cold War era, 1960s, 1970s and later====
During the Cold War Dutch Air Force flying units were integrated in NATO&#x27;s Second Allied Tactical Air Force tasked with defending northern West Germany against Warsaw Pact forces. Additionally, the Dutch Air Force manned five fully operational self-supporting Missile Groups in West Germany (1 and 2 MslGrp were initially equipped with NIKE batteries, while 3,4 and 5 MslGrp were equipped with Hawk) and replaced by the MIM-104 Patriot Air Defence Missile System:

* 306, 311, 312, 322 and 323 Sqn changed configuration again from 1962 to 1984 after the dual role F-104 Starfighter was introduced.
* 313, 314, 315 and 316 Sqn switched over to the NF-5 Freedom Fighter from 1969 to 1991. The NF-5 was a development of the Canadair CF-5 fighter. Northrop incorporated some NF-5 features into the F-5E/F Tiger II.
* Since 1979 all RNLAF fast-jet squadrons (originally 306, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 322 and 323) have operated the multi role F-16 Fighting Falcon.

The Dutch Air Force played a key role in ending the 1977 Dutch train hostage crisis when six F-104G Starfighters flew low over the train to distract the hijackers while Dutch anti-terrorist forces stormed the train.

====Former Yugoslavia====

In 1992 Ypenburg Air Base closed. After the USAF handed over their section of Soesterberg in September 1994, Soesterberg then became a RNLAF transport helicopter base with 298 Squadron (CH-47D Chinook) and 300 Squadron (AS 532U2 Cougar Mk2 and SA 316 Alouette III) stationed at the base.

RNLAF F-16s participated in all operations over Yugoslavia from 1993: Deny Flight, including Deliberate Force in 1995 and ending with Operation Allied Force in 1999 from two bases in Italy. Initially from Villafranca AB in the north of Italy, later moving south to Amendola AB. During the operations over FRY RNLAF F-16s flew reconnaissance (306 Sqn detachments from Volkel AB were in theatre throughout the operations), enforced the Bosnian no-fly zone, dropped bombs on Udbina AB (1994), successfully dropped an unguided bomb on a moving Serb tank during the fall of Srebrenica (1995), and took part in Deliberate Force later in the summer of 1995.

Between 1994 and 1997 Dutch GCI personnel, along with Canadian GCI controllers, provided many hundreds of hours of fighter control and surveillance as integrated members of USAF/ANG Air Control Squadrons. In May 1999 during the Kosovo crisis a RNLAF F-16AM pilot Major Peter Tankink shot down a Yugoslavian MiG-29 with an AMRAAM, but the force was more recognized for its high bombing accuracy. Allied Force was also the operational debut for the upgraded F-16AM. Besides the CAP missions, offensive bombing and photo reconnaissance missions were flown. KDC-10 tankers refuelled allied aircraft over the Adriatic Sea, and C-130 Hercules transports flew daily sorties from Eindhoven AB to logistically support the operation. Dutch F-16s also dropped cluster bombs on Niš. In total, RNLAF aircraft flew 1,194 sorties during operation Allied Force, which is about 7.5% of the total 37,000 sorties flown.

====Operation Enduring Freedom and NATO in Afghanistan====
On 2 October 2002 a tri-national detachment of 18 Dutch, Danish and Norwegian F-16 ground attack aircraft and one Dutch KDC-10 tanker deployed to Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan in support of ground forces in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The KDC-10 returned to the Netherlands on 1 April 2003, and the Dutch F-16 detachment on 1 October 2003. The RNLAF returned to Manas AB on 8 September 2004 with five F-16 and one KDC-10 in support of the presidential elections of Afghanistan. This time the aircraft flew under the NATO ISAF flag. On 24 March 2005 the Dutch detachment transferred from Manas AB to Kabul International Airport. A detachment of six AH-64D Apache helicopters were already stationed at Kabul International Airport from April 2004 until March 2005.

In February 2006 four Dutch F-16s were joined by four Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16s in a detachment known as the 1st Netherlands-Norwegian European Participating Forces Expeditionary Air Wing (1 NLD/NOR EEAW). This was a follow-up of the participation with the Belgian Air Component.

As part of the expanded NATO ISAF mission in southern Afghanistan in August 2006, the Royal Netherlands Air Force had three CH-47D Chinook of 298 Sq stationed at Kandahar Airfield. On 12 November 2006 eight F-16s transferred from Kabul International Airport to Kandahar Airfield, Additionally, a detachment of six (later four) AH-64D Apache helicopters had been stationed of Tarin Kowt, Uruzgan province. The CH-47D Chinooks of 298 sq rotated with Cougars from 300 sq. All helicopters together with a few F-16s returned to the Netherlands in November 2010. The other four F-16s transferred from Kandahar Airfield to Mazar-e-Sharif International Airport in November 2011. The F-16 flight, providing Close Air Support for ground forces and Recce Flights (specialised in counter-IEDs), ended their mission officially on 1 July 2014.

On 31 August 2006 a Royal Netherlands Air Force (Michael &quot;Sofac&quot; Donkervoort) pilot was killed when his plane crashed during a mission to support British ground troops in Helmand province.

On 7 December 2007 military use of Twente Air Base ceased. The aerodrome is now known as Enschede Airport Twente. Flying officially ended at Soesterberg Air Base on 12 November 2008. The last jet ever to take off was a Hellenic AF F-4E. The base closed on 31 December 2008. The 298th and 300th squadron moved to Gilze-Rijen Air Base. A part of the base remains in use as a glider field. The former USAFE side will be in use by ground units relocated from Kamp van Zeist and will be called &quot;Camp New Amsterdam&quot;. The AF museum (Royal Netherlands Military Aviation Museum) returned to the base and will use most of the existing hangars.

====2010s and 2020s====

In 2013 the Royal Netherlands Air Force provided Strategic Airlift Support with a KDC-10 in support of French operations in Mali.

The RNLAF was hit hard by the Dutch defence cuts after the 2008 financial crisis. 311 Squadron was disbanded in September 2012, leaving four squadrons of F-16s, and one DC-10 transport aircraft was disposed of.

In October 2014 the Netherlands Air Force joined the US and its Allies fighting ISIL, deploying eight F-16s (of which two are in reserve) to Jordan.

On 31 October 2014 323 Tactess squadron (F-16) disbanded and its aircraft and personnel were merged into 322 Squadron. The following Wednesday (5 November) the squadron reformed in the US as the RNLAF&#x27;s first Joint Strike Fighter unit.

303 Squadron (Agusta Bell AB 412SP) provided search and rescue within Dutch Flight Information Region) until 1 January 2015 when the unit was disbanded.

In 2015 Airbus A330 MRTT were ordered to replace two Dutch KDC-10 Tanker / Transport aircraft. The Netherlands is the lead nation in NATO initiative to replace and pool existing Tanker / Transport, including Luxembourg, Belgium (1), Germany (4), Norway (1) within EATC, in 2014 it was announced that the Airbus A330 MRTT has been selected and two are ordered for the Royal Netherlands Air Force with options to eight aircraft based in adjoining countries. In 2017 the Belgian Air Component, German Air Force and Royal Norwegian Air Force confirmed orders by joining the MMF program to a total of 9 aircraft of which 5 will be based at Eindhoven Airbase and 4 at Cologne Air Base. They will carry Royal Netherlands Air Force roundels and be registered as Dutch aircraft. In November 2019 it was announced that the Dutch KDC-10 tankers were sold to Omega Aerial Refueling Services. The last Dutch KDC-10 was taken out of service in October 2021.

As per 2017 the Air Defence - Quick Reaction Force of two F-16 fighters are integrated for Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg airspace and rotated between Dutch and Belgian ADF squadrons.

In 2021 a Brik-II satellite was launched to provide the Royal Netherlands Air Force with intelligence regarding navigation, communication and observation of the earth.

In May 2022 it was reported that several MQ-9 Reapers would be used to patrol in the Dutch Caribbean.

On 27 September 2024 the RNLAF formally retired the F-16 after 45 years of service. A farewell flight was held on the same day in which the aircraft flew past several military airfields in the Netherlands.

In November 2024 it was announced that in 2027 the Dutch satellite PAMI-1 will be launched and will be used by the Defensie Space Security Center (DSSC), which is part of the RNLAF. That same month it was also announced that a contract to purchase 12 Airbus H225M helicopters had been signed.

====Operation Inherent Resolve====
From 2014 the Royal Netherlands Air Force provided eight F-16&#x27;s in support of the coalition fighting IS. The aircraft were initially deployed in Iraq and later in Syria. The mission was handed over to the Belgian Air Component in July 2016 after more than 2,100 missions were flown, with weapons used over 1,800 times. The Royal Netherlands Air Force contributed extensively to the missions flown by the coalition forces and were in high demand.

Since 2017, RNLAF KDC-10 and C-130H Hercules are deployed to the Middle East to assist the United States led coalition in Operation Inherent Resolve.

In January 2018 the Dutch F-16&#x27;s returned to the Middle East for a year-long deployment.

== Structure of the Royal Netherlands Air Force ==
* Commander of the Royal Netherlands Air Force
** Air Force Command Staff
** Volkel Air Base
** Leeuwarden Air Base
** Eindhoven Air Base
** Defense Helicopter Command
** Air Operations Control Station Nieuw-Milligen
** Royal Netherlands Air Force Military School-Woensdrecht Air Base
** Woensdrecht Logistic Centre
** People and Aviation Centre
The RNLAF is in the process of restructuring into four major commands:

* Air Combat Command (ACC), bringing together Leeuwarden and Volkel air bases and the Air Operations Control Station Nieuw Milligen through the restructuring of the Air Force Staff Department for Fighter Operations ( (&quot;AJO&quot;))
* Air Mobility Command (AMC) on the basis of Eindhoven air base through the restructuring of Air Force Staff Department for Air Transport Operations ( (&quot;ALTO&quot;)). Eindhoven air base has been officially transformed and designated as Vliegbasis Eindhoven - Air Mobility Command.
* Defence Helicopter Command (DHC) - the previously joint command of tactical helicopters of the Royal Netherlands Air Force and the naval helicopters of the Royal Netherlands Navy has been fully integrated into the RNLAF. 
* Air Support Command (ASC) - ground operational support to the flying units.

Another command related to air warfare is the Joint Ground-based Air Defence Command. The RNLAF&#x27;s Patriot and Stinger missile air defence batteries are part of the air force, but come operationally under the JGADC, together with the 61st Missile Air Defence Group of the German Air Force. The JGADC is subordinated to the Royal Netherlands Army.

The force structure reform is done in line with the concept called Fifth Generation Air Force () and in addition to the reshuffling of the RNLAF in four major commands the concept plans for:

* Replacement of the F-16 by the F-35A in three squadrons (completed)
* Replacement of the KDC-10 by the A330 MRTT (KDC-10 completely withdrawn and replaced by NATO MRTT)
* Replacement of the C-130H Hercules by 5 Embraer C-390 Millenium
* Introduction of additional- &amp; armed MQ-9 Reapers
* Upgrade of the Chinook fleet to the CH-47F MYII CAAS standard (in progress)
* Upgrading the AH-64D Apache to the AH-64E Guardian standard, incl. Joint Air to Ground Missile (in progress)
* Forming a Joint Target Support Cell
* Forming an Air Command and Control capacity
* Forming a Fighter Center of Excellence
* Forming a dedicated SOF Rotary Wing Air by upgrading and re-tasking the existing Cougar fleet and acquisition of 12 H225M Caracals from 2028 onwards
* Forming a National Air and Space Operations Center (NASOC)
* Combining Helicopter Training with German Army at Bückeburg Air Base
* Acquiring strategic air to ground weapons for F-35A such as AGM-158 JASSM-ER &amp; AGM-88G
* Replacing PC-7 Basic Training Aircraft with PC-7 Mk.X

===Current inventory===

The F-16 inventory of the Netherlands Air Force stood at 42 before the announcement was made that these would be transferred to the Ukrainian Air Force as part of the Dutch assistance package. The first 10 are transferred as per December 2023, with over 20 as per June 2024.

===F-35A===
To replace its F-16 fleet the RNLAF considered the Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 52/60, the Dassault Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II. In 2002 the Netherlands signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) to co-develop the F-35 as a &#x27;Tier 2&#x27; Partner. Two test aircraft were ordered between 2009 and 2011. Two F-35A have been delivered for the testing program and for training pilots and maintenance crew. This first aircraft is stationed at a base in Florida, US.

On 17 September 2013 the F-35A was officially selected as the replacement for the Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 MLU, the Ministry of Defense announced that it will buy 35 additional F-35As between 2014 and 2023, bringing the total to 37, the maximum number fitting the original budget for F-16 replacement. In February 2014 Parliament approved the purchase of the first batch of eight F-35A aircraft, to be delivered from 2019. The purchase of fifteen additional aircraft was announced by the Dutch government in December 2018 for a third squadron to NATO, totalling 52 jets, the first batch of nine additional aircraft was ordered in 2019. In 2022 the acquisition of six additional F-35As was announced to set up a third squadron as requested by NATO. In September 2024 the acquisition of six additional aircraft was announced to supplement the existing three squadrons.

<doc id="652948" wikidata="Q420439" url="?curid=652948" title="Dimenhydrinate">
<text>Dimenhydrinate, also known as diphenhydramine/8-chlorotheophylline salt and sold under the brand names Dramamine and Gravol, among others, is an over-the-counter medication used to treat motion sickness and nausea. Dimenhydrinate is a theoclate salt composed of diphenhydramine and 8-chlorotheophylline (a theophylline relative) in a 1:1 ratio.

Dimenhydrinate was introduced to the market by G.D. Searle in 1949.

== Medical uses ==

Dimenhydrinate is an over-the-counter (OTC) first-generation antihistamine indicated for the prevention and relief of nausea and vomiting from a number of causes, including motion-sickness and post-operative nausea.

== Side effects ==
Common side effects of dimenhydrinate may include drowsiness, dry mouth, nose, or throat, constipation, and blurred vision. Some individuals, particularly children, may experience feelings of restlessness or excitement. In certain cases, more severe symptoms may arise, such as delirium, weakness, and a tendency to be easily startled. Hallucinations, psychosis, and an unusual sensitivity to sudden sounds have also been reported. Continuous and/or cumulative use of anticholinergic medications, including first-generation antihistamines, is associated with higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older people. However, in younger people this is not relevant. 

== Pharmacology ==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Diphenhydramine is the primary constituent of dimenhydrinate and dictates the primary effect. The main differences relative to pure diphenhydramine are a lower potency due to being combined with 8-chlorotheophylline (by weight, dimenhydrinate is between 53% and 55.5% diphenhydramine) and the fact that the stimulant properties of 8-chlorotheophylline help reduce the side effect of drowsiness brought on by diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine is itself an H1 receptor antagonist that demonstrates anticholinergic activity.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
The diphenhydramine component requires about 2hours to reach peak concentration after either oral or sublingual administration of diphenhydrinate, and has a half-life of 6hours in healthy adults.

== Recreational use ==
Dimenhydrinate is recreationally used as a deliriant. Slang terms for Dramamine used this way include &quot;drama&quot;, &quot;dime&quot;, &quot;dime tabs&quot;, &quot;D-Q&quot;, &quot;substance D&quot;, &quot;d-house&quot;, and &quot;drams&quot;. Abusing Dramamine is sometimes referred to as Dramatizing or &quot;going a dime a dozen&quot;, a reference to the amount of Dramamine tablets generally necessary for a recreational dose.

Many users report a side-effect profile consistent with tropane alkaloid (e.g. atropine) poisoning as both show antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in both the central and autonomic nervous system, which inhibits various signal transduction pathways.

Other CNS effects occur within the limbic system and hippocampus, causing confusion and temporary amnesia due to decreased acetylcholine signaling. Toxicology also manifests in the autonomic nervous system, primarily at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in ataxia and extrapyramidal side effects and the feeling of heaviness in the legs, and at sympathetic post-ganglionic junctions, causing urinary retention, pupil dilation, tachycardia, irregular urination, and dry red skin caused by decreased exocrine gland secretions, and mucous membranes. Considerable overdosage can lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack), serious ventricular arrhythmias, coma, and death. Such a side effect profile is thought to give ethanolamine-class antihistamines a relatively low abuse liability. An antidote that can be used for dimenhydrinate poisoning is physostigmine.

== History ==
Dimenhydrinate (then known as Compound 1694) was being tested as a potential treatment for hay fever and hives at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1947 by allergists Dr. Leslie Gay and Dr. Paul Carliner. Among those who received the drug was a pregnant woman who had suffered from motion sickness her entire life. She remained symptom-free if she took dimenhydrinate a few minutes before boarding a trolley, whereas the placebo was ineffective. To confirm these findings, the following year, G.D. Searle &amp; Co. conducted a trial in which dimenhydrinate or placebo was given to U.S. troops crossing the Atlantic during &quot;a rough passage&quot; in a converted freight ship, the General Ballou, for 10 days as a rescue therapy for sea sickness. The findings were positive, as were the findings of a second trial of mostly women on the ship&#x27;s return voyage. Gay and Carliner announced their discovery at a meeting of the Johns Hopkins Medical Society on February 14, 1949, as well as in the Bulletin of The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The &quot;New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, and other national newspapers covered the discovery, and Dramamine was made available in drugstores later that year.

== Brand names ==
Dimenhydrinate is marketed under many brand names: in the U.S., Mexico, Turkey and Thailand as Dramamine; in Serbia as Dimigal; in Ukraine as Driminate; in Canada, Costa Rica, and India as Gravol; in Iceland as Gravamin; in Russia and Croatia as Dramina; in South Africa and Germany as Vomex; in Australia as Travacalm; in Austria as Vertirosan; in Brazil as Dramin; in Colombia as Mareol; in Ecuador as Anautin; in Hungary as Daedalon; in Indonesia as Antimo; in Italy as Xamamina or Valontan; in Peru as Gravicoll; in Poland and Slovakia as Aviomarin; in Portugal as Viabom, Vomidrine, and Enjomin; in Spain as Biodramina; in Israel as Travamin; and in Pakistan as Gravinate.

== Popular culture ==
Modest Mouse produced a song titled &quot;Dramamine&quot; on their 1996 debut album &quot;This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About&quot;. The song uses side effects of the drug as a metaphor for the deteriorating state of a personal relationship.

”The Ending Of Dramamine” is the opening track of the album How To Leave Town by Car Seat Headrest.

One of the earliest known references of it&#x27;s popularity in pop culture was in the 1958 film Zero Hour! when the pilot asks a sick passenger &quot;Would you like some dramamine?&quot;

<doc id="652949" wikidata="Q1552457" url="?curid=652949" title="Sopor (sleep)">
<text>Sopor is a condition of abnormally deep sleep, similar to a stupor but not as severe, from which it is difficult to rouse a person. It involves a profound depression of consciousness, which is manifested by drowsiness, while maintaining coordinated defensive reactions to stimuli such as pain, harsh sound, and bright light, and preserving vital functions. Sopor may be caused by a drug; such drugs are deemed soporific. A stupor is more severe than a sopor.
The name is derived from Latin &quot;&quot; (cognate with the Latin noun &quot;somnus&quot; and the Greek noun ὐπνος, &quot;hypnos&quot;).

== Causes and symptoms== 
Soporous states can be caused by traumatic, vascular, inflammatory, neoplastic, and toxic lesions of the brain.

Symptoms include lack of response to the environment and inability to perform any tasks or respond to questions. The ability to swallow is maintained.
Examination will reveal decreased muscle tone of the extremities and depression of tendon reflexes.
Pupillary reaction to light may be sluggish, but the corneal reflexes are preserved.
Paresis and Babinski sign may be present.

<text>John Peter Rhys Williams (2 March 1949 – 8 January 2024) was a Welsh rugby union player who represented Wales in international rugby during their Golden Era in the 1970s. 
He became known universally as J.P.R. Williams (or sometimes just as JPR) four years after his Welsh debut, in 1973 when J.J. Williams (also John) joined the Welsh team.

Playing in the position of full-back, he was noted for his aggressive attacking style. With his long sideburns and socks around his ankles, &quot;JPR&quot; was an iconic figure on the successful 1970s Wales team. However, despite playing full-back throughout his international career, his preferred position was flanker, where he played for Tondu at the end of his career.

Williams is one of a small group of Welsh players to have won three Grand Slams including Gerald Davies, Gareth Edwards, Ryan Jones, Adam Jones, Gethin Jenkins and Alun Wyn Jones.

An orthopaedic surgeon by profession, Williams continued to be involved in rugby following his retirement, serving as president of the Bridgend Ravens.

==Early life==
Williams was born just outside Bridgend, Wales, and was educated at Bridgend Boys&#x27; Grammar School (now Brynteg Comprehensive School) and then Millfield School in Somerset, as was his Wales teammate Gareth Edwards.

As well as being a rugby union player, Williams was also a successful tennis player at youth level, before fully committing to rugby. He won the 1966 British Junior title at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, beating David Lloyd 6–4, 6–4; this is often erroneously cited as being a Junior Wimbledon victory, including in J.P.R.&#x27;s autobiography, when in fact it was won by Vladimir Korotkov. As an adult amateur, Williams participated in the first event of the tennis Open Era, the 1968 British Hard Court Championships in Bournemouth, but lost to Bob Howe in the first round. In an interview years later, Williams stated that &quot;If I had to make the decision now, I might have opted for tennis,&quot; but admitted that his lack of a big serve would have hindered any chances of success.

== Rugby career ==
Williams&#x27; focus moved from tennis to rugby union, which was an amateur sport, in order to pursue a career in medicine. He quickly attracted attention and was consequently first capped by Wales in 1969, aged 19.

Williams went on to earn 55 caps for Wales, five as captain, and eight for the British Lions. Williams played club rugby for Bridgend, London Welsh and Tondu. He also played a few games for shortly after the 1974 Lions tour.

Williams had many high points in his career, being a key player in a Welsh side that won Grand Slams in 1971, 1976 and 1978, and is particularly remembered for his record against England. In 10 tests between Wales and England he scored five tries – exceptional for a full-back – and was never on the losing side. He was also outstanding for the Lions, scoring an important long-range drop goal in the fourth test of the 1971 series against New Zealand. In the 1974 &#x27;invincible&#x27; series against South Africa he again played a major role.

Williams was involved in the build up of the famous 1973 Barbarians try against New Zealand, sometimes called the greatest try ever scored. Williams chose not to go on the 1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand, after being advised by his consultant to focus on his medical career.

Williams retired from international rugby union in 1981 and continued his career as an orthopaedic surgeon. He continued to play club rugby for many years, playing throughout the 1980s and 1990s for Bridgend and then for Tondu Thirds into his fifties. He finally retired in March 2003.

===Playing style===
At the times Williams played, the rugby rules restricted kicking to touch. This suited Williams as he did not naturally like kicking and would rather counter attack. For Wales this was helped by playing with very high-quality wingers, such as Gerald Davies and J. J. Williams.

=== Welsh international rugby honours and statistics ===
* First cap: 1 February 1969, Murrayfield, Scotland ( 3 – Wales 17)
* His fifty-five caps comprised 37 wins, four draws and 14 defeats
* Member of three Grand Slam-winning teams: 1971, 1976, 1978.
* Member of six Triple Crown-winning teams: 1969, 1971, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979
* Scored 36 points (five four-point tries and one three-point try; three penalty goals and two conversions)
* Captained Wales five times (1978–79 – Championship and Triple Crown Season)
* Final cap: 7 February 1981, Murrayfield, Scotland ( 15 – Wales 6)

=== Recognition ===

In 1977 Williams was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to rugby.

Williams was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1979 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Thames Television&#x27;s Teddington Studios.

Williams was one of the inaugural inductees of the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997.

Sean Fitzpatrick and Ian McGeechan have said Williams was the best rugby full-back of all time.

== Medical career and other activities ==
Williams studied medicine at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School, qualifying as a physician in 1973. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1980. In 1986 he was appointed a consultant in trauma and orthopaedic surgery at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.

Williams represented several cricket teams, particularly the Lord&#x27;s Taverners team, between 1976 and 2004.

In January 2006, in a party of 16 Welsh men and women, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania for charity, helping to raise more than £200,000 for the NSPCC&#x27;s &#x27;Full Stop&#x27; Campaign.

==Personal life ==
Williams was married to Scilla and the couple had four children. They lived in the Vale of Glamorgan.

==Death==
Williams died from bacterial meningitis, after a short illness, on 8 January 2024, at the age of 74 at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

==Views==

Williams regarded Barry John as &quot;Without doubt, the greatest player I played with.&quot;

In 2008 Williams said that if, when he was young, rugby and tennis had been in the conditions that they then were (in 2008) then he would have chosen to play tennis rather than rugby, because of the greater financial rewards of tennis and the increased physical dangers of rugby.

<doc id="652967" wikidata="Q662137" url="?curid=652967" title="Roman Republican currency">
<text>Roman Republican currency is the coinage struck by the various magistrates of the Roman Republic, to be used as legal tender. In modern times, the abbreviation RRC, &quot;Roman Republican Coinage&quot; originally the name of a reference work on the topic by Michael H. Crawford, has come to be used as an identifying tag for coins assigned a number in that work, such as RRC 367.

Coins came late to the Republic compared with the rest of the Mediterranean, especially Greece and Asia Minor where coins were invented in the 7th century BC. The currency of central Italy was influenced by its natural resources, with bronze being abundant (the Etruscans were famous metal workers in bronze and iron) and silver ore being scarce. The coinage of the Roman Republic started with a few silver coins apparently devised for trade with the Greek colonies in Southern Italy, and heavy cast bronze pieces for use in Central Italy.

During the Second Punic war a flexible system of coins in bronze, silver and (occasionally) gold was created. This system was dominated by the silver denarius, a denomination which remained in circulation for 450 years. The coins of the republic (especially the denarii) are of particular interest because they were produced by &quot;mint magistrates&quot;, junior officials who chose the designs and legends. This resulted in the production of coins advertising the officials&#x27; families for political purposes; most of the messages on these coins can still be understood today.

==Before coinage==
Before the introduction of coinage in Italy the two important forms of value in the economy were sheep (&quot;pecus&quot;), from which the Latin word for money (&quot;pecunia&quot;) is believed by some to have been derived, and irregularly shaped pieces of bronze known as aes rude (&quot;rough bronze&quot;) which needed to be weighed for each transaction. It is unclear when money became commonly used, but Roman tradition recorded that pay of the army began during the siege of Veii in 406 BC and it appears that Aes rude was the currency well before this. Toward the end of the 4th century BC bronze began to be cast in flat bars which are known today, without any historical authority, as aes signatum (&quot;signed bronze&quot;). These bars were heavily leaded, of varying weights although generally on the order of five Roman pounds, and usually had a design on one and later both sides. The actual function of aes signatum has been variously interpreted; although a form of currency they were not coins since they did not adhere to a weight standard. Rome produced its own aes signatum around 300 BC which are distinguished by the inscription &quot;ROMANOM&quot; (of the Romans) and production continued to about the end of the first Punic war in 240 BC, overlapping some of the developments described below.

==Cast bronze coinage==

According to Pomponius, a lawyer who lived during the 2nd century AD, the group of three mint magistrates tresviri monetales was established in 289 BC, but this date seems to be far too early, and if they did not come into existence during the Second Punic War, the formation of a formal college may not have occurred until some time after 200 BC. The three members of this committee were officially known as the &quot;tres viri aere argento auro flando feriundo&quot; (&quot;the three men responsible for casting and striking bronze, silver and gold&quot;), a lengthy title that was almost always abbreviated to &quot;III.V.A.A.A.F.F.&quot;. Julius Caesar briefly raised their number to four.

According to Suidas, the mint was located in (or at least near) the temple of Juno Moneta on the Capitoline Hill. By this time Rome was familiar with coinage, as it had been introduced to Italy in the Greek colonies of Metapontum, Croton, and Sybaris before 500 BC and Neapolis ca 450 BC. Rome had conquered a large portion of central Italy, giving it large quantities of bronze, but little silver.

A system of heavy cast leaded bronze coinage was introduced; these issues are known as aes grave (heavy bronze) by numismatists. Stylistically the coins were distinctly Roman and, due to both their size and their being cast rather than struck, crude compared to the coinage elsewhere around the Mediterranean at the time. The standard coin was the &quot;as&quot;; the word &quot;as&quot; referred to a coin and also to a unit of weight – in fact, &quot;as&quot; could also mean any unit – of length, area, and sometimes just the number one.

The bronze coinage was initially a more or less full value currency rather than a token currency, based on the &quot;libral standard&quot; where the &quot;as&quot; weighed one Roman pound (libra) with fractions in units of Roman ounces (unciae), with 12 unciae in a libra. The &quot;uncia&quot; was thus also both a weight and a coin of the same weight. This changed when the weight of the aes grave was decreased to approximately 10 unciae ca 270 BC (the &quot;light libral standard&quot;, remaining at that level until 225 BC, then suddenly to 5 unciae (the &quot;semi-libral standard&quot;) c. the start of the second Punic war in 218 BC, finally falling to 1.5–1 unciae around 211 BC.

In addition to the &quot;as&quot; and its fractions, multiples of the &quot;as&quot; were also produced. Fractions were much more common than &quot;asses&quot; and their multiples during the period of aes grave. By the time of the semi-libral standard, the smaller denominations such as the uncia and semuncia were struck rather than cast. A variety of less common denominations were minted over time; those found in Crawford (1974) are listed here.
== Introduction of Greek-style silver coinage ==
Greek-style struck bronze coins were produced in small quantity with the inscription ΡΩΜΑΙΩΝ around 300 BC; only a handful of examples exist today. They are believed to have been produced on behalf of Rome by Neapolis, based on the similar style and weight with Neapolis&#x27; own coinage, and used to facilitate trade in the wake of the construction of the Appian Way, started in 312 BC.
Rome entered into a war against Tarentum in 281 BC; the Tarentines enlisted the support of Pyrrhus of Epirus. It was in this context that Rome produced its first Greek-style silver didrachm (RRC 13/1) with the head of Mars wearing a Corinthian helmet on one side and the head of a horse with the inscription ROMANO (worn off on the example shown) and a grain ear behind. This coinage may have predated the aes grave discussed above, but was minted and used largely in Magna Graecia and Campania. It was clearly part of a broader trend; payment of Roman and allied troops fighting in the Pyrrhic war appears to have been crucial in spreading the use of Greek-style coinage throughout the southern Apennine areas of Italy. This issue is today thought to have been minted in Neapolis because it was minted on that weight standard (7.3 g), not that of Metapontum, Tarentum, and other South Italian cities (which was 7.9 g at the start of the war but fell to 6.6 g during its course). This issue was thought earlier to have been minted in Metapontum because the grain-ear is the most common type on Metapontine coins and the Mars head is very similar to the head of Leucippus (a local hero, the Messenian king who re-founded Metapontum, not the philosopher) on an earlier coin produced there.
A number of different coins were minted in increasing volumes over the next few years, but the first silver coin now thought to have been minted in Rome itself is the Hercules/She-wolf didrachm (Crawford 20/1). The date of this issue is likely 269 BC, as the devices on this coin refer to that year&#x27;s consuls Q. Ogulnius L.f A.n. Gallus and C. Fabius C.f. M.n. Pictor. Hercules, shown on the obverse his club (shown undersized above his shoulder) and a lion skin tied around his neck, was the divine patron of the Fabii. Quintus and his brother Cnaeus Ogulnius had, as curule aediles, prosecuted moneylenders; part of the proceeds were used to set up near the Ficus Ruminalis a statue of Romulus and Remus being suckled by the she-wolf as shown on the reverse. Some historians believe that these coins were valued at 10 &quot;asses&quot; making them denarii, this assertion is based on the account of Pliny in the 1st century AD, where he states that the denarius was introduced in 269 BC. Most historians today, however, do not see this as a denarius, but another didrachm.

This last and most other Roman coins were produced in small numbers until the introduction of the didrachm we refer to as the quadrigatus. The quadrigatus, produced in large quantity starting around 235 BC, was named after the reverse image of Victory driving a quadriga and was produced for about 2 decades, becoming more and more debased (to as little as 30% silver) during the second Punic war.

== The denarius system ==

=== As introduced ===

The denarius, which became the main silver coin of Rome for over four centuries, was introduced in 211 BC or a few years earlier, and produced in enormous quantity from the silver captured in the sack of Syracuse. The denarius (RRC 44/5), valued at 10 &quot;asses&quot; as indicated by the mark X and weighing about 4.5 grams (72 to a Roman pound), was introduced as part of a complex multi-metallic coinage. Also in silver was the half denarius, the quinarius (RRC 44/6, marked V), and the quarter denarius, the sestertius (RRC 44/7, marked IIS and shown on the left), all bearing a head of Roma on the obverse and a reverse of the dioscuri riding with their capes behind (a reference to their supposed assistance to Rome at the battle of Lake Regillus).

Bronze &quot;asses&quot; and their fractions (all now struck rather than cast) continued to be produced to a standard of about 55 grams; this was very quickly reduced to a sextantal standard and finally an uncial standard of roughly 32 gms. By this time, &quot;asses&quot; outnumbered their fractions, perhaps because legionary pay was increased to the point where the &quot;as&quot; could become the principal component.

In gold, there were three pieces worth 60 &quot;asses&quot; (RRC 44/2, marked ↆX), 40 &quot;asses&quot; (RRC 44/3, marked XXXX) and 20 &quot;asses&quot; (RRC 44/4, marked XX). All featured a head of Mars on the obverse and an eagle with outspread wings standing on a thunderbolt on the reverse. The eagle is somewhat reminiscent of the eagle that had consistently been a symbol on Ptolemaic coinage since the very beginning of the century, and it has been suggested that Ptolemy IV Philopator may have provided gold for this issue to act as a counterweight to the involvement of Philip V of Macedon on the side of Carthage.

The victoriatus, another silver coin (RRC 44/1), was also introduced in large quantity at the same time. It seems to have been quite separate from the denarius system proper as X-ray fluorescence spectrometry has shown that these were produced to an entirely different standard of fineness. While an analysis of 52 early denarii, quinarii, and sestertii showed a silver concentration of 96.2 ± 1.09%, 19 victoriati from the same period have highly variable fineness ranging from 72 to 93%. Early finds of victoriati are primarily in Southern Italy and Sicily and it is thought that the victoriati with a weight of 3/4 of a denarius were used to pay non-citizens with experience of the Greek coinage system in the drachma format to which they were accustomed, but with debased/overvalued coins. The quadrigatus didrachm, which had been retariffed to 15 &quot;asses&quot; (1.5 denarii), was removed from circulation almost immediately.

===Evolution: weights and fineness===
Over the next 40 years, the denarius slowly lost weight. The reason for this is unclear, but in the early days it may have been the ongoing pressure of the Second Punic War. Afterwards the Roman state had a debt equivalent to 25 years direct taxation on Roman citizens (~1 million denarii); this was not fully repaid until Cn. Manlius Vulso returned with the spoils of Asia after the Treaty of Apamea, (188 BC). The weight was officially changed from 72 to the pound (6 scruples) to 84 to the pound at that time; it remained relatively stable thereafter.


The silver content during republican times remained well above 90%, usually above 95% with the exception of Marcus Antonius&#x27;s later coinage, especially the massive issue of Legionary &quot;denarii&quot; of 32–31 BC just prior to the Battle of Actium (an example is shown on the right), rumored to be silver from Egypt provided by Cleopatra.

===Evolution: silver vs bronze===

By about 140 BC (the exact date is unclear) the denarius was retariffed to 16 &quot;asses&quot;, indicated by XVI on the obverse of the denarius. This appears first on the coinage marked L.IVLI (RRC 224/1), commonly dated to 141 BC. The clear marking with the number XVI was soon again replaced with an X, but often now with a horizontal bar through the centre as shown in the second example on the left (RRC 243/1); this is sometimes read as a monogram of XVI with all the letters superimposed. The re-tariffing is thought to have been a recognition of a relationship that had developed because of decreased &quot;as&quot; weights, both due to wear of old &quot;asses&quot; and to decreasing mint weights of newer ones. This meant that the quinarius was worth eight &quot;asses&quot;, and the sestertius four &quot;asses&quot;. The new denarius-to-&quot;as&quot; ratio lasted for hundreds of years. At about the same time the unit of account changed from &quot;asses&quot; to sestertii (HS). This may well be an indicator of inflation.

The victoriatus continued to circulate well into the 2nd century BC. Victoriati were later popular in places such as Cisalpine Gaul where they circulated alongside drachmae of Massalia (Marseille).

===Evolution: gold===
The gold 60, 40, and 20 &quot;as&quot; coins were only minted for a few years; gold in general appears to have been used at first only as an emergency coinage. Gold coins reappeared in 82 BC when Sulla was gathering funds for the war against Mithridates VI of Pontus immediately after the financial strains of the Social War. Sulla&#x27;s coinage is commonly considered the first for which the name (denarius) aureus was used. Aureii were minted in large numbers by Julius Caesar in preparation for a proposed war against Parthia and issuing of the aureus continued to increase after the fall of the republic.

==Coinage and political messages==

Eventually a new reverse appeared, first Luna driving a &quot;biga&quot; (two horse chariot) in 194–190 BC, and then Victory driving a biga in 157 BC – thought to refer to the final defeat of Perseus of Macedon at the battle of Pydna by Lucius Aemilius Paulus in 168 BC. These Victory &quot;bigati&quot; became the most common type of denarius. Denarii were marked with special symbols (such as a star or an anchor) from very shortly after their introduction and soon monograms indicating the tresviri monetales (mint masters, often called moneyers, that were responsible for the issue) were on the coins. In some cases the symbols are &quot;punning&quot;. The example reverse shown to the left (RRC 187/1 showing Luna driving a biga) is one such; a shell symbol appears above the horses along with the letters &quot;PVR&quot; below. The shell is thought to be a murex shell; this was the source of Tyrian purple (in Latin: purpureo) and this, along with the letters, is thought to refer to a Furius Purpureo. This type of reference to the moneyers became more and more explicit, and eventually developed into self-advertising to further the political career of the moneyers.
Families who had already had members in the Senate were more likely to have further family members elected to political office (and thus become senators). This was so much more likely that only a few consular novi homines (new men) are known to history. Advertising on coins was thus often about the moneyer&#x27;s family. In the coin reverse shown on the right (RRC 268/1b), the legend around the outside indicates that moneyer was N. Fabius Pictor. The seated individual is wearing a cuirass, holding a spear in his left hand and an apex, the characteristic hat worn by the flamines, in his right. At his side there is a shield inscribed QUIRIN. This is taken to refer to Q. Fabius Pictor (probably the son of Quintus Fabius Pictor the annalist) who was elected praetor in 189 BC and assigned the province of Sardinia by lot (Livy 37.50.8). He was also the flamen Quirinalis and because of this, P. Licinius Crassus, the pontifex maximus of the day did not allow him to take the Sardinian office because of various taboos surrounding the flamen&#x27;s person, and the need for the flamen to perform certain rites in Rome (Livy 37.51.3–7). The Sardinian praetorship was exchanged for both the urban and peregrine praetorships, and N. Fabius Pictor remained in Rome. The entire incident was part of the political manoeuvring of Scipio Africanus against his attackers, which included the Fabii.
Over time, the politics of the day became more and more visible in the coinage. In 54 BC, the first triumvirate had control of Rome, and Pompey was its preeminent member. There were rumours that Pompey was to be made dictator. In this context, the coin on the left (Crawford 433/2) was a powerful political message. The moneyer, Marcus Junius Brutus, placed on the coin two figures from Roman history that he claimed as ancestors: 
** Lucius Junius Brutus of the Junia gens, who was made the first consul of the republic of Rome in 509 BC after he expelled Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the Roman kings, and
** Gaius Servilius Ahala, who killed Spurius Maelius – a knight who endeared himself to the populace of Rome by providing free grain during a famine – reputedly in a bid for seeking kingship – in 439 BC. Marcus Brutus was also known as Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus, as he had been adopted into the gens Servilia, from which he was descended on his mother&#x27;s side.

In the face of famine in 57 BC Pompey had been made a special commissioner to control the supply of grain; this included the control of all ports and trading centres for five years. There was earlier bad blood between them; Pompey had put down an earlier insurrection by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in which Brutus&#x27;s father had been involved; Pompey had had him executed. It was the opposition of Cato the Younger, Brutus&#x27;s half brother on his adopted family&#x27;s side, to Pompey&#x27;s requests for land for his veterans of the war against Mithradates that gave Pompey the incentive to be part of the triumvirate. M. Brutus was clearly making a pointed, uncompromising statement of opposition to Pompey and the triumvirate while praising his ancestors.
In 44 BC, Julius Caesar was preparing for war with Parthia to avenge the defeat inflicted by the Parthians on Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae. To this end, an enormous variety of denarii and aureii were being minted in large numbers. The coin on the right is from January–February 44 BC. The Venus holding Victory and a sceptre on the reverse was a reference to the claim of the gens Julia to descend from Aeneas and thus Anchises and the goddess Venus. This was innocuous to Romans, but the obverse showing Caesar himself wearing the gold laurel wreath that the Senate had voted for him was an enormous departure from tradition and deeply offensive. While the coinage had been used to show ancestors, this is the first time that the head of a living Roman had been displayed on Roman coinage. It was widely perceived as part of a larger series of moves by Caesar to make himself king – and kings were anathema in Rome ever since the foundation of the republic. Other coins minted at the same time bore the text &quot;DICT QVART&quot;, indicating that Caesar had been dictator for four years running. A later version (RRC 480/10, February–March 44 BC) showed &quot;DICT PERPET&quot;; Caesar had been made dictator for life. He was assassinated, by Brutus among others, on the Ides of March, 44 BC.
The assassination could not revive the republic. Two years later, just prior to the Battle of Philippi, Brutus produced a coin (RRC 508/3, modern forgery shown to the left) celebrating the freeing of the republic from Caesar&#x27;s tyranny. The reverse showed two daggers flanking a pileus (a cap used in the ceremony freeing slaves) and the legend &quot;EID MAR&quot;. On the obverse, Brutus, the &quot;noblest Roman&quot;, had placed his own head. The republic survived, by convention more than reality, until Octavian, Caesar&#x27;s nephew and heir was declared Augustus in 27 BC.

==Sources of evidence==
The dates on all the coins mentioned above can not be known with absolute certainty. Sometimes particular coins can be linked to a well defined event in history, e.g. the &quot;dict perpet&quot; denarii of Caesar can be dated very closely to his assassination, but this is rarely the case. Much dating of the coinage is based on evidence from coin hoards. The hoarding of coins, especially by burial, was a &quot;banking system&quot; often used in ancient times, particularly in times of crisis; hoarding during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey was so extensive that it resulted in a liquidity crisis. Hoards can present evidence in several ways
* The location of the hoard can speak to where the coins in question circulated.
* The archaeological context of a coin hoard can set an approximate date for the production of the coinage. As an example, excavations of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus uncovered coins beneath the temple; the date the temple was built is known and so a terminus ante quem for the period of their production can be deduced.
* The differential wear of coins in a hoard can be used to establish a relative chronology. Coins that had circulated longer prior to burial should show more wear.
* The composition of the hoard in terms of coin types can speak to what sorts of coins circulated in the same place at the same time and their relative abundance. From this, relative chronologies can sometimes be extracted.
* Comparison of multiple coin hoards can help to establish relative chronologies; if a series of coins is well represented in one large coin hoard and some are missing from a second large hoard, it is likely that they were minted after that hoard was buried.

Despite all of this, the evidence remains unclear. In this case, numismatic scholars attempt to make their best estimate of the absolute and relative chronology. In English, the current standard work is Crawford 1974 which built on and superseded the work of Sydenham 1952, Grueber 1910, Babelon 1886, and Mommsen 1850. The chronology used by this article and the identification of coins by the label RRC xx/yy identifies a particular item in that catalogue. There is however newer evidence, particularly in the period 170–149 BC, where analysis of the recently discovered Mesagne hoard has led to the alternate chronologies of Hersh &amp; Walker 1984, and Harlan 1995. An alternate naming of the coinage of the form &quot;gens ##&quot; (e.g. &quot;Fabia 11&quot; for the 11th coin minted by a moneyer of the gens Fabia; i.e. RRC 268/1) is also sometimes still used. This was devised by Babelon and used by Grueber, Sydenham, and many newer books.

<text>A corn dog (also spelled corndog and also known by several other names) is a hot dog on a stick that has been coated in a thick layer of cornmeal batter and deep fried. It originated in the United States and is commonly found in American cuisine.

==Name variations==
In Canada, corn dogs are often called &quot;Pogos&quot; after the popular brand produced by Conagra.

In Australia, where they have become a popular food at agricultural shows and carnivals, they are known as either &quot;Pluto pups&quot;, &quot;Dagwood dogs&quot;, &quot;dippy dogs&quot; or (historically) &quot;pronto pups&quot;. The name &quot;Pluto pup&quot; likely derives from the Disney character Pluto, who is a dog. &quot;Dagwood dog&quot; is derived from the name of a character from the American comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;, which was created in 1930. In the comic strip, Dagwood, Blondie&#x27;s husband, has a dog named Daisy. Historically, the name &quot;pronto pup&quot; was originally used as a brand name in the United States in 1941, although this name had become obsolete as early as 1949 and was replaced by the name &quot;Pluto pup&quot;. Some have suggested that Pluto pups are made in factories, while Dagwood dogs are prepared on site.

In France, the term is used, which literally translates to &quot;sausage donut&quot;.

In Japanese, the most common name for them is .

In New Zealand, the name &quot;hot dog&quot; or &quot;mini hot dog&quot; is often used.

==History==

German immigrants in Texas, who were sausage-makers finding resistance to the sausages they used to make, have been credited with introducing the corn dog to the United States, though the serving stick came later. A US patent filed in 1927, granted in 1929, for a &quot;Combined Dipping, Cooking, and Article Holding Apparatus&quot;, describes corn dogs, among other fried food impaled on a stick; it reads in part:
A &quot;Krusty Korn Dog&quot; baker machine appeared in the 1926 Albert Pick-Barth wholesale catalog of hotel and restaurant supplies. The &#x27;korn dogs&#x27; were baked in a corn batter and resembled ears of corn when cooked.

A number of current corn dog vendors claim responsibility for the invention and/or popularization of the corn dog. Carl and Neil Fletcher lay such a claim, having introduced their &quot;Corny Dogs&quot; at the State Fair of Texas sometime between 1938 and 1942. Pronto Pup of Rockaway Beach, Oregon, claims to have invented the corn dog in 1939. Cozy Dog Drive-in, in Springfield, Illinois, claims to have been the first to serve corn dogs on sticks, on June 16, 1946. Also in 1946, Dave Barham opened the first location of Hot Dog on a Stick at Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, California.

==Preparation==
Corn dogs are often served as street food or as fast food. For the best and freshest preparation, some vendors or restaurateurs dip and fry their corn dogs just before serving. Some corn dog purveyors sell pre-made frozen corn dogs, which are then thawed and fried again, or browned in an oven.

Corn dogs can also be found at almost any supermarket and convenience store in North America as frozen foods as well as served hot and ready to eat. Pre-made frozen corn dogs can also be heated in a microwave oven, but the cornbread coating will lack texture.

==Variations==
One cheesy variation is prepared either with melted cheese between the hot dog and the breading or by using a cheese-filled hot dog.

Another version is the &quot;cornbrat&quot; (or &quot;corn brat&quot;), which is a corn dog made with bratwurst instead of a wiener or hot dog.

Small corn dogs, known as &quot;corn puppies&quot;, &quot;mini corn dogs&quot;, or &quot;corn dog nuggets&quot;, are a variation served in some restaurants, generally on the children&#x27;s menu or at fast food establishments. A serving includes multiple pieces, usually 10. In contrast to their larger counterparts, corn puppies are normally served stickless as finger food.

A breakfast version of the corn dog features a breakfast sausage in place of the hot dog, and pancake batter in place of the cornmeal. This variation is commonly called a &quot;pancake on a stick&quot;. It was formerly served by the drive-in restaurant Sonic, but it is now made by companies such as Jimmy Dean.

Both vegetarian corn dogs and corn dog nuggets are made as meatless alternatives by many of the same companies that produce vegetarian hot dogs.

===By country===

==== Argentina ====
In Argentina, a &quot;panchuker&quot; (or &quot;panchuque&quot;, &quot;pancho chino&quot;) is a hot snack that can be bought near some train stations and in some places of heavy pedestrian transit. They are more popular in the inner country cities. A panchuker consists of a sausage covered with a waffle-like pastry, and has a stick in it (like a corn dog) so that it can be easily consumed. Some versions contain cheese, and sauces may be served to accompany them. Some variations may be found in Uruguay and other South American countries. Generally, panchukers are offered as a low-price fast food and can only be seen at certain places of the inner country—like the cities of La Plata, Villa Albertina, and Cipoletti —and, in Buenos Aires, they can be found in Barrio Chino and Belgrano. They are particularly popular in certain regions in the Northwest, such as the province of Tucumán.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, a hot dog sausage on a stick, deep-fried in batter, is known as a Dagwood Dog, Pluto Pup, or Dippy Dog, depending on region. Variants use wheat-based or corn-based batters. These are not to be confused with the Australian battered sav, a saveloy deep fried in a wheat flour-based batter, as used for fish and chips, which generally does not contain cornmeal.

They are popular at agricultural shows and carnivals, such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show.

==== Canada ====
In Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, a battered hot dog on a stick is called a &quot;pogo&quot; and is traditionally eaten with ordinary yellow mustard, sometimes referred to as &quot;ballpark mustard&quot;. The rest of Canada refers to them by the non-trademarked term &quot;corn dog&quot;. It is named after the trademarked name of a Conagra frozen product available in all of the country since the 1960s but whose main market is the province of Quebec.

==== Japan ====
In Japan, the equivalent food is usually called an based on the idea of where the food is believed to originate. The batter is usually made with wheat flour, and fish sausage may be used. In eastern regions of Hokkaido, a variant with granulated sugar instead of usual ketchup topping is called .

==== New Zealand ====
A New Zealand Hot Dog is invariably a deep-fried battered saveloy or pre-cooked sausage on a stick that is then usually dipped in tomato sauce (ketchup). The saveloy or sausage used is thicker than a frankfurter, and is coated in a thinner batter layer than American corn dogs. The batter can be cornmeal based or corn flour based. The distinction is not particularly important. The sausage in a bun that is called a hot dog in other countries is known as an &quot;American Hot Dog&quot; and is usually available at the same locations. If a further descriptor is needed to avoid confusion between the two, the New Zealand standard hot dog can be described as a hot dog on a stick.

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, a corn dog is a popular cafe/fair food. A corn dog is usually called &quot;Yankee&quot; in the Afrikaans language. It is usually served with a sweet pink sauce made from a mixture of mayonnaise, tomato sauce and condensed milk.

==== South Korea ====
In South Korea, a corn dog is one of the most popular street foods. A corn dog is usually called &quot;hot dog&quot; in the Korean language (), creating confusion with a genuine hot dog. A French fry–encrusted corn dog, or &quot;Kogo,&quot; has especially attracted the attention of Western visitors, including vegans (using vegan hot dogs).

==Annual celebration==
National Corndog Day is a celebration of the corn dog, tater tots, and American beer that occurs on the first Saturday of March Madness every year.

<doc id="652979" wikidata="Q1502806" url="?curid=652979" title="Geo (automobile)">
<text>Geo was a brand of small cars marketed by General Motors (GM) as a subdivision of its Chevrolet division from 1989 to 1997.

Geo was a joint venture between GM and Japanese automakers to compete with the growing small import market in the United States during the mid-1980s. Subcompact cars and SUVs, either badge engineered or based on Japanese models, were produced by GM at its facilities in North America or imported from Japan. Geo was discontinued after the 1997 model year and merged into Chevrolet. The Geo Metro, Prizm, and Tracker were sold as Chevrolets from the 1998 model year until their discontinuances in 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively. In this sense, Geo existed until 2004, even with the Geo nameplate being dropped in mid-1997.

Asüna, a counterpart marque to Geo in Canada, was introduced by GM in 1992 to provide Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealers access to a similar range of import vehicles.

== Manufacturing ==
Geo models were manufactured by GM in joint ventures with three Japanese automakers: Toyota, Isuzu, and Suzuki. The Prizm was produced at the GM/Toyota joint-venture NUMMI assembly plant in Fremont, California in the United States, and the Metro and Tracker models were produced at the GM/Suzuki joint-venture CAMI assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario in Canada. The exceptions, the Spectrum and Storm, were entirely manufactured by Isuzu in Japan. Geo Metro convertibles and early Geo Trackers were built by Suzuki in Japan.

== Marketing ==
Geo&#x27;s logo was based on the Chevrolet logo which was a globe outline with the Chevrolet bow tie in the middle, primarily seen on steering wheels of most Geo models. Its original slogan was &quot;Get to know Geo&quot; and commercials often featured the song &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; from the musical &quot;The King and I&quot;.

== Models ==

=== Metro ===
The Geo Metro is a small economy car that was based on the Suzuki Swift (Cultus) produced from 1989 to 2001 model years. The first generation was offered in three and five-door hatchback models as well as a 4-door notchback sedan that was only sold in Canada. In 1990, a convertible was available but was phased out after 1993. The Metro came in three trim levels: XFi, base, or LSi. The XFi&#x27;s engine has less horsepower than the base and LSi and achieved a gas mileage of 53 mpg (city) and 58 mpg (highway). All of the Metros at this time had three cylinder engines with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission. The convertible is also the only first-generation Metro to offer an airbag. In 1995, the Metro was redesigned with a more modern appearance and offered a four-cylinder engine, standard dual airbags and optional anti-lock brakes. A four-door sedan replaced the five-door hatchback. The XFi did not return for 1995 and only the Base and LSi models were offered. The three-cylinder engine remained in the base hatchback. In 1998 the Metro, now branded as a Chevrolet, was revamped one last time. It was given minor restyling, improved headlamps, and improved four cylinder engine, now producing . The 2000 model year was the last for the Metro hatchback and the three cylinder engine. All 2001 models were four-door sedans that were sold to fleets only.
=== Prizm ===
The Prizm is a compact four-door sedan that was based on the Toyota E90 and E100 platform Toyota Sprinter. It was the successor to the Chevrolet Nova. A five-door hatchback model was also offered through 1991. While the Prizm consistently won awards from the auto industry (including a &quot;Consumer&#x27;s Digest&quot; Best Buy selection), it was always outsold by the platform twin Toyota Corolla. Additionally, the Prizm was positioned within Chevrolet&#x27;s own model lineup and competed with the Cavalier for market share and dealer floor space. The Prizm was sold from 1989 through 2002 and produced at NUMMI in Fremont, California. The Prizm came in either a base model or a more upscale LSi version that had an optional 1.8 L engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission. Leather interior was also optional on the LSi model. From 1990 to 1992, the Prizm had a sporty GSi model with red and black badging. It was equivalent in power and equipment to the Corolla GT-S although the latter was a coupe. The GSi was the most powerful Prizm with . The Prizm model line was not offered in Canada.
=== Spectrum ===
The Spectrum was a short-lived subcompact model based on the Isuzu Gemini and one size up from the Metro. The Spectrum was sold as a regular Chevrolet model from 1985 to 1988. The 85-86 models shared several subtle differences to their 87-89 counterparts and were still fully branded as Chevrolets for the first year of production in 1989. However, with the launch of the Geo marque in 1989, the Spectrum was rebranded as a Geo. Although the grille stayed the same (including the Chevrolet &quot;bowtie&quot; emblem without Geo &quot;globe&quot;) the rear &quot;Chevrolet&quot; emblem was replaced with a &quot;Geo&quot; emblem. The Geo Spectrum was only sold in 1989 and was replaced by the Isuzu-produced Geo Storm hatchback. 
=== Storm ===
The Storm was a sports car based on the Isuzu Impulse, available as a three-door fastback &quot;Sport Coupe&quot; and a two-door &quot;Hatchback&quot;, the latter styled as a mini station wagon in profile, often referred to as the &quot;Wagonback&quot; in some markets. The Storm entered Geo&#x27;s lineup in 1990 as a base model or in GSi trim, replacing the related Geo Spectrum. The base model came with a choice of either a 3-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual. The Storm line entered Canada in 1992, and the Hatchback (wagon) was offered only in base model trim. The GSi models came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, better handling, a rear spoiler, bucket seats, and a more powerful DOHC engine. In 1992, the front and rear of all models were restyled, the GSi sported a bigger 1.8 liter DOHC engine, replacing the former 1.6 DOHC, and a redesigned rear spoiler. Despite strong sales the Storm was discontinued in 1993, this was due in part to Isuzu discontinuing their car lines, and refocusing on trucks and SUVs. The Geo Storm was the performance oriented vehicle of the Geo marque. The Storm and the Geo Spectrum were produced in Japan by Isuzu.
=== Tracker ===
The Geo Tracker was an SUV introduced in 1989 and based on the Suzuki Sidekick. It was a low cost 4x4 vehicle, introduced as a two-door with either a convertible or fixed hard top in base or upscale LSi versions. All models between 1989 and 1990 were offered in 5-speed manual with four-wheel drive. In 1996, the two-door hard top was dropped in favor of the four-door model. The four-door offered a engine and an optional four-speed automatic transmission. The Tracker was produced from 1989 to 1998 under the Geo marque, and 1999 to 2004 under Chevrolet itself, making it the longest running Geo model. The Tracker was completely redesigned for the 1999 model year.

<doc id="652981" wikidata="Q3315116" url="?curid=652981" title="Minister for the Civil Service">
<text>In the Government of the United Kingdom, the Minister for the Civil Service is responsible for regulations regarding His Majesty&#x27;s Civil Service, the role of which is to assist the governments of the United Kingdom in formulating and implementing policies. The position is invariably held by the prime minister of the United Kingdom.

==The role==
In recognition of the primary authority of the prime minister over the Civil Service, it is a constitutional convention that the ministry would always be held by the prime minister. The list of ministers for the civil service is therefore identical to the list of prime ministers of the United Kingdom from 1968 onwards.

By the terms of the Civil Service (Management Functions) Act 1992, the minister may delegate his or her power to ministers and others such as the Scottish Government. Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Tom Watson to be responsible for digital engagement and Civil Service issues, while the Prime Minister has given the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and minister for the Cabinet Office (Pat McFadden and Nick Thomas-Symonds respectively) responsibility for the Civil Service.

The Transfer of Functions (Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service) Order 1995, a statutory instrument which transferred functions to the minister responsible for the Civil Service, came into force on 1 April 1995.

The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 codifies the power of the Minister for the Civil Service to manage the Civil Service, including the power to make appointments, the publication of the Civil Service code of conduct, and the right to be consulted before publication of recruitment principles by the Civil Service Commission. The Act also requires the Minister for the Civil Service to publish a special adviser code of conduct, approve the terms and conditions of appointment of special advisers, and publish an annual report about special advisers serving the UK government.

==Civil Service Department==
The ministership was created for Harold Wilson on 1 November 1968 when responsibilities for the pay and management of the Civil Service was transferred from HM Treasury to a new Civil Service Department.

Margaret Thatcher announced the abolition of the Civil Service Department to the House of Commons on 12 November 1981.

<doc id="652987" wikidata="Q1191394" url="?curid=652987" title="Department for Work and Pensions">
<text>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for welfare, pensions and child maintenance policy. As the UK&#x27;s biggest public service department it administers the State Pension and a range of working age, disability and ill health benefits to around 20 million claimants and customers. It is the second-largest governmental department in terms of employees, and the second largest in terms of expenditure (£228 billion ).

The department has two delivery services: Jobcentre Plus administers working age benefits: Universal Credit, Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance; the Child Maintenance Service provides the statutory child support scheme. DWP also administers State Pension, Pension Credit, disability benefits such as Personal Independence Payment, and support for life events from Maternity Allowance to bereavement benefits.

Non-departmental bodies accountable to DWP include the Health and Safety Executive, The Pensions Regulator and the Money and Pensions Service.

==History==

The department was created on 8 June 2001 as a merger of the Department of Social Security, Employment Service and the policy groups of the Department for Education and Employment involved in employment policy and international issues.

The department was initially tasked with creating Jobcentre Plus and the Pensions Service from the Employment Service and the Benefits Agency. The department became responsible for welfare and pension policy. It aims &quot;to help its customers become financially independent and to help reduce child poverty&quot;.

In 2012, the department fully subsumed pensions, disability and life events under the DWP name; Jobcentre Plus and Child Maintenance Service remain as distinct identities publicly.

Until 2021, the DWP was still using ICL VME based computer systems originating from its 1988 Pension Service Computer System to support state pension payments. The software was migrated to an in-house VME replacement system, in one of the largest computer replacement projects in Europe.

==Ministers==
DWP ministers are as follows:

The Permanent Secretary is Sir Peter Schofield.

==Pension Service==

With the creation of the department in June 2001, the Pension Service was created, bringing together many different departments and divisions. The Pension Service is a &#x27;dedicated service for current and future pensioners&#x27;.

The Pension Service consists of local Pension Centres and centrally-based centres, many of latter are based at the Tyneview Park complex in Newcastle upon Tyne. The following centres are at Tyneview Park:

* Future Pension Centre (FPC) provides state pension forecasts for people approaching retirement age.
* Newcastle Pension Centre (NPC) originally dealt with the London area, the Home Counties, and part of West Midlands. Now the service is virtual so all pension centres deal with all areas of the country.
* Pension Tracing Service (PTS) helps track old pensions and pension schemes.
* International Pension Centre (IPC) deals with all enquiries regarding the payment of state pension, bereavement benefits, incapacity benefits and other such benefits for those living abroad.

Local Pension Centres deal with localised claims for state pension and retirement related benefits. Pension Centres are found all over the country. Benefits dealt with at local Pension Centres include:

* Pension Credit (replaced a former scheme known as &#x27;Minimum Income Guarantee&#x27; in October 2003)
* Winter Fuel Payments
* Cold Weather Payments

==Disability and Carers Service==
The Disability and Carers Service offers financial support for those who are disabled and their carers, whether in or out of employment. The DCS have offices throughout the country and deal with the following benefits:

* Disability Living Allowance
* Attendance Allowance
* Carer&#x27;s Allowance
* Vaccine Damage Payment
* Personal Independence Payment

The department has been found to frequently invite disabled people to interviews in buildings which are themselves not accessible to people with disabilities. When the person does not attend the interview they deny the person disability benefits, causing malnutrition and destitution. The DWP systematically underpaid disabled claimants who were transferred from Incapacity Benefit to Employment and Support allowance, risking hardship for claimants. A cross party committee of MPs, the Public Accounts Committee accused the DWP of a culture of indifference to claimants.

Since at least 2020 DWP has had a policy of cold-calling vulnerable and disabled people to attempt to pressure them into accepting lower benefit claims than they were legally entitled. In July 2021 the DWP agreed to stop after it was threatened with legal action.

===Disability Confident scheme===
DWP administers the Disability Confident scheme, which supports employers to employ people with disabilities and to maintain the employment of staff who become disabled. The scheme operates as three levels:
*Level 1: Disability Confident Committed
*Level 2: Disability Confident Employer
*Level 3: Disability Confident Leader

The scheme is intended to encourage employers to &quot;think differently about disability and take action to improve how they recruit, retain and develop disabled people&quot;, but the DWP lost more disability discrimination cases at employment tribunal than any other employer in Britain between 2016 and 2019.

==Tell Us Once==
The DWP introduced the &quot;Tell Us Once&quot; system in 2011 to enable people to use a single interface to inform the government about a change in their personal circumstances. Using &#x27;Tell Us Once&#x27;, departments and agencies like the pensions service, HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the Passport Office and local authorities are informed about a person&#x27;s change in circumstances in parallel, removing the need for &quot;repeated, unnecessary form-filling&quot;. Local authority departments making use of the service include libraries, housing departments, &quot;Blue Badge&quot; services and adult social care.

In most cases, a Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths will notify a person who registers a death about using the service.

DWP transferred to a cloud-based service in 2016 using the government&#x27;s G-Cloud purchasing process for IT services. The Crown Commercial Service states that &quot;cutting administration costs and reducing the overpayments of benefits—usually because of out-of-date records of people&#x27;s personal circumstances—protected the cross-government savings generated by Tell Us Once, estimated at more than £20 million per year. By switching from a physical infrastructure to a cloud solution, DWP has also benefited from cost savings of around 50% on the IT running costs of Tell Us Once&quot;.

==Former structure==
Before 2008, The Pension Service and the Disability and Carers Service were two separate executive agencies; however, it was decided in April 2008 to merge them into one entity named The Pension, Disability and Carers Service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pension, Disability and Carers Service Business Plan 2008/9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Both former agencies kept their corporate branding and provided services under their separate identities. The decision was made due to the two agencies sharing about half of the same customers; as a single agency, the rationalisation of services would provide a better service for customers.

The status of PDCS as an executive agency (and its existence as a merged entity) was removed on 1 October 2011 with the functions being brought back inside the department; and both The Pension Service and the Disability and Carers Service becoming distinct entities once again. Prior to July 2012 the Child Support Agency was the operating arm of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (CMEC).

All are now operated wholly from within the department, with the brand names shut down in 2012.

The department&#x27;s public bodies include:

===Executive non-departmental public bodies===
* Health and Safety Executive
* Money and Pensions Service
* The Pensions Regulator

===Advisory non-departmental public bodies===
* Social Security Advisory Committee

===Tribunals===
* Pensions Ombudsman

===Public corporations===
* National Employment Savings Trust
* Office for Nuclear Regulation
* Pension Protection Fund

==Estate==
The department has corporate buildings in London, Leeds, Blackpool, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Newcastle upon Tyne, Warrington, Manchester and Sheffield. Jobcentre Plus, Child Maintenance Service and other departmental services operate through a network of around 650 Jobcentres and service centres across the UK.

==Budget==
The total annual budget of the department in 2011–12 was £151.6 billion, representing approximately 28% of total UK Government spending. The department spends a far greater share of national wealth than any other department in Britain, by a wide margin. The department spends an average of £348.9 million with suppliers per month. The government noted in 2013 that DWP&#x27;s third-party expenditure was characterised by a number of &quot;complex, high-value contracts&quot;.

A report of February 2012 found that billions of pounds payable had not been claimed. In 2009–2010 the DWP stated £1.95 billion job-seekers allowance, £2 billion income support and employment and support allowance, £2.4 billion in council tax, £2.8 billion in pension credit and £3.1 billion for housing benefit; in total £12.25 billion had not been claimed.

==Research==
The department is a major commissioner of external social science research, with the objective of providing the evidence base needed to inform departmental strategy, policy-making and delivery. The department has developed and uses various microsimulation and other models, including the Policy Simulation Model (for appraisal of policy options), Pensim2 (to create projections of pension entitlements up to 2100) and Inform (to produce the department&#x27;s benefit caseload forecasts). Datasets held include the LLMDB and the Family Resources Survey.

During 2012 the department announced records of the number of people born outside of the United Kingdom (&quot;non-UK nationals&quot;) claiming work-related benefits from 2011, using data already collated within the department together with those of HM Revenue and Customs and the UK Border Agency (whose duties are now fulfilled by UK Visas and Immigration).

==Devolution==

===Scotland===
Employment, health and safety, and social security policy are reserved matters of the United Kingdom government. The Scotland Act 2016 devolved specific areas of social security to the Scottish Government to administer and reform. The Scottish Parliament passed the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 to establish a statutory basis of Social Security in Scotland. This created a principled based legislative agenda for Social Security providing for social security to be a human right in Scotland. Most aspects of social security in Scotland remain reserved to the United Kingdom and those will remain administered by the DWP.

The Act established Social Security Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government.

===Northern Ireland===
Northern Ireland has parity with Great Britain in three areas:
* social security
* child support
* pensions

Policy in these areas is technically devolved but, in practice, follows policy set by Parliament to provide consistency across the United Kingdom. Employment and health and safety policy are fully devolved.

The department&#x27;s main counterparts in Northern Ireland are:

* the Department for Communities (administers welfare policy)
* the Department for the Economy (oversees the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland)

==Supply chain and procurement==
Partners, providers and sub-contractors are used extensively by DWP, for supply of goods and services in general but especially in employment related services. A Code of Conduct aiming to &quot;to ensure excellent sub contractual relationships between the top-tier and high performing third sector and other organisations&quot; working for these schemes was established in the department&#x27;s 2008 Commissioning Strategy. This code was subsequently developed into the &quot;Merlin Standard&quot;, &quot;a standard of behaviour which DWP prime providers are expected to adhere to in their relationship with their subcontractors ... [and which] is designed to encourage excellence in supply chain management by prime providers&quot;. A &quot;Merlin Standard Advisory Board&quot; was established in July 2011. The Merlin Standard was replaced with new Provider Guidance in 2013.

DWP contributes to government ambitions to make supply chains more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, but the government commented in 2013 that it had yet to secure good insight into the supply chain role of SMEs.

==Controversies==
In August 2015, the department admitted using fictional stories from made-up claimants on leaflets advertising the positive impact of benefit sanctions, following a Freedom of Information request from &quot;Welfare Weekly&quot;, claiming that they were for &quot;illustrative purposes only&quot; and that it was &quot;quite wrong&quot; to pass these off as genuine quotes.

Later that month figures were released which showed that between December 2011 and February 2014, 2,650 people died shortly after their Work Capability Assessment told them that they should be finding work. The DWP had fought hard for the figures not to be released, with chief minister Iain Duncan Smith at one point telling Parliament that they did not exist.

In 2019, a computer system was introduced but the DWP refused to reveal details. Claimants and their supporters feared it would add to poverty and hardship. Frank Field MP stated in early 2020 that claimants, &quot;will be left at the mercy of online systems that, even now, leave all too many people teetering on the brink of destitution. We&#x27;ve already seen, in the gig economy, how workers are managed and sacked, not by people, but by algorithms. Now the welfare state looks set to follow suit, with the &#x27;social&#x27; human element being stripped away from &#x27;social security&#x27;.&quot;

In 2019, the department was found by an independent inquiry to have broken its own rules, in a case where a disabled woman killed herself in 2017 after her benefits were stopped when she missed a Work Capability Assessment because she had pneumonia. Previous research published in the &quot;Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&quot; by Oxford University and Liverpool University had found that there were an additional 590 suicides between 2010 and 2013 in areas where such assessments were carried out. The researchers said that the DWP had introduced the policy of moving people off benefits without understanding the consequences. In 2022 the department refused to release data to researchers at Glasgow University who were investigating if benefit sanctions were linked to suicides. This was despite earlier promises by ministers that they were supporting the researchers.

<text>The West Coast Computer Faire was an annual computer industry conference and exposition most often associated with San Francisco, its first and most frequent venue. The first fair was held in 1977 and was organized by Jim Warren and Bob Reiling. At the time, it was the biggest computer show in the world, intended to popularize the personal computer in the home. The West Coast PC Faire was formed to provide a more specialized show. However, Apple Inc. stopped exhibiting at the West Coast Computer Faire, refusing to exhibit at any show other than COMDEX that also had PC-based exhibits.

In 1983, Warren sold the rights to the Faire for US$3 million to Prentice Hall, who later sold it to Sheldon Adelson, the owner of Interface Group and COMDEX. In total, sixteen shows were held, with the last in 1991. After Warren sold the show, it had a few more good years, and then declined rapidly.

==History==
The first fair took place on April 16–17, 1977, in San Francisco Civic Auditorium, and saw the debut of the Commodore PET, presented by Chuck Peddle, and the Apple II, presented by then-22-year-old Steve Jobs and 26-year-old Steve Wozniak. At the exhibition, Jobs introduced the Apple II to Japanese textile maker Toshio Mizushima, who became the first authorized Apple dealer in Japan.Other visitors included Tomio Gotō who developed the TK-80 and PC-8001, and Kazuhiko Nishi who produced the MSX. There were about 180 exhibitors, among them Intel, MITS, and Digital Research.

When the first fair opened, almost twice as many people arrived as Warren anticipated, and thousands of people were waiting to get into the auditorium. More than 12,000 people visited the fair.

The 2nd West Coast Computer Faire was held March 3–5, 1978, at what was then the San Jose Convention Center. This event had the first-ever microcomputer chess tournament, won by &quot;Sargon&quot;.

The 3rd West Coast Computer Faire was held on November 3–5, 1978, at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

The 4th West Coast Computer Faire returned to San Francisco in May 1979 at Brooks Hall and Civic Auditorium. Dan Bricklin demonstrated VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program for personal computers.

At the 5th West Coast Computer Faire, held in March 1980, Microsoft announced their first hardware product, the Z-80 SoftCard, which gave the Apple II CP/M capabilities.

The 6th West Coast Computer Faire was held on April 3–5, 1981, notable for being the venue where Adam Osborne introduced the Osborne 1.

The 7th West Coast Computer Faire saw the introduction of the 5 MB Winchester disk drive for IBM PCs by Davong Systems. It was held on March 19–21, 1982, in San Francisco. That year&#x27;s conference also featured a Saturday breakout session, titled &quot;THE IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER&quot;, with eight talks delivered in a three-hour period. One of these was (as listed in the program):

 &quot;P.C. — Impact on the MicroComputer Industry&quot; 
 Bill Gates, President
 Microsoft
 10800 N.E. 8th #819
 Bellevue, WA 98004

At its peak, all available spaces for exhibits were rented out, including the balcony of Civic Auditorium, and the hallway to the restrooms in Brooks Hall (where Bob Wallace (&quot;Quicksoft&quot;) introduced &quot;PC-Write&quot;).

The 8th West Coast Computer Faire was held March 18–20, 1983.

Subsequent West Coast Computer Faires were held in Moscone Center in San Francisco. After the 10th Faire, Bruce Webster wrote that &quot;Warren sold out just in time. The Faire is shrinking. It may not be dying, but it is no longer the important trade show it was two short years ago. Without the giant booths from IBM, Apple, and AT&amp;T, the Faire would have looked like any other small, local, end-user show. The move to the Moscone Center didn&#x27;t help that impression; a large chunk of the main floor was unused, adding to the impression of the Faire&#x27;s shrunken size&quot;.

The 12th West Coast Computer Faire was held in March 1987.

The 16th West Coast Computer Faire was held from May 30 to June 2, 1991, at Moscone Center.

<text>Drawsko Pomorskie (until 1948 ; ) is a town in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northwestern Poland. It is the administrative seat of Drawsko County and the urban-rural commune of Gmina Drawsko Pomorskie. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 11,292. It is home to the Drawsko Training Ground, one of the largest training areas in Poland.

==Geography==
Located in the southeast of West Pomeranian Voivodeship (since 1999) in the Pomerania region, Drawsko is situated within the Pomeranian Lakeland, the western spur of the Baltic Uplands. The town lies on the headwater of the Drawa River, a right tributary of the Noteć, west of an expansive woodland with the protected area of the Drawsko Landscape Park.

The regional capital Szczecin is about to the west. A large training area south of the town is frequently used in NATO exercises.
==History==
===Medieval Poland===

From the 7th century onwards Slavic tribes settled along the shores of the Drawa River, where they erected a fortress a few kilometers north of Lake Lubie. In the 10th century the region was under the sovereignty of the Piast duke Mieszko I of Poland; however, the sparsely inhabited border area during the fragmentation of Poland was also claimed by the Dukes of Pomerania, and later also by the mighty Ascanian margraves John I and Otto III.

===New March===
At that time, the fortress of Drawsko had been held by Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland, but after his death the settlement was also acquired by the Margraves of Brandenburg. They invited Premonstratensian monks from Belbuck (Białoboki) Abbey near Trzebiatów to found a monastery in their new territory. These plans failed, however, as the desired location was too far from Belbuck and the monks saw the wilderness as unsuitable. The Brandenburg margraves planned to expand upon a settlement already developing near the fortress of Drawsko. The Uckermark knights Arnold, Konrad and Johann von Goltz were granted the right to develop the settlement into a town mentioned as &quot;Drawenborch&quot;. It grew after the arrival of German colonists, allowing the margraves to grant it Magdeburg city rights in 1297.

When the Ascanian dynasty became extinct in 1320, the colonisation efforts in the Neumark region abated. Nevertheless, to promote the further development of the newly established town of Dramburg, the Wittelsbach margrave Louis I of Brandenburg released the town from all duties from 1338 until 1350, when he ceded the town as a fief to the noble Wedell family. On 13 February 1368, Dramburg was the setting of a peace treaty between Elector Otto VII of Brandenburg and King Casimir III of Poland, whereby Otto returned the town of Wałcz to Poland. The influx of colonists began to cease, although by the end of the 14th century the Dramburg &quot;Neustadt&quot; (&quot;new town&quot;) had developed on the southern shore of the Drawa.

From 1373 the New March was part of the Lands of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown under the House of Luxembourg. The decay of the region continued: held by Jobst of Moravia since 1388, it was pawned by his cousin Sigismund to the Teutonic Knights in 1402, despite an agreement with Poland, based on which Poland was to buy and re-incorporate the territory. The Teutonic Knights also neglected the region, which furthermore was devastated by Hussite forces in 1433. In 1454 the Knights sold the New March to the Hohenzollern elector Frederick II of Brandenburg, in order to raise funds for war with Poland. From that time on, the Hohenzollerns retained the region; the red eagle of the town&#x27;s coat of arms was taken from the coat of arms of Brandenburg.

In 1537 the former Franciscan friar Faustinus Schliepe introduced Lutheranism to Dramburg during the Protestant Reformation. From 1540 the town was administered by the Order of St. John in Germany (until 1808). A great fire destroyed a wide section of Dramburg in 1620, leaving only five houses unscathed, while five years later numerous citizens died from plague. In 1638 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Swedish colonel Beer plundered and pillaged Dramburg. Despite that setback, the town&#x27;s economic advantages allowed it to recuperate quickly. Dramburg had staple rights, giving it the privilege to force merchants traveling on the Drawa to offer their wares, such as Kołobrzeg (Kolberg) salt, for sale at Dramburg&#x27;s markets. Wool-weaving and shoe-making were also important craft industries since the Middle Ages.

===Province of Pomerania===
Dramburg became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. With the reorganization of the Prussian provinces in 1815 following the Napoleonic Wars, Dramburg left the Neumark region and in 1818 became the seat of &quot;Landkreis Dramburg&quot; in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Köslin within the Prussian Province of Pomerania. Dramburg became part of the German Empire after the 1871 unification of Germany.

In 1877 the Pommersche Zentralbahn (Pomeranian Central Railway) became connected to the town, which was also connected in 1896 to the Saatziger Kleinbahnnetz (Szadzko District railroad network). Dramburg&#x27;s access to the railroads led to the establishment of wood and textile industries. This led the Pommersche &quot;Saatzucht Gesellschaft&quot; based in Stettin (Szczecin) to use the Dramburg region as a testing area for its plant breeding experiments.

After Poland regained its independence and reincorporated many areas previously annexed by the Germans (but not Drawsko/Dramburg), following the 1919 Treaty of Versailles after World War I, many Germans from the former Province of Posen immigrated to Dramburg, expanding settlement in the south of the town. When the province of Posen-West Prussia was disbanded in 1938, Dramburg became part of &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; Schneidemühl (Piła). At the start of World War II, the German 4th Army invaded Poland from the town, and the &quot;Einsatzgruppe IV&quot; followed to commit atrocities against the Poles in various cities and towns, including Chojnice, Bydgoszcz, Białystok and Warsaw. During the war, the &quot;SS&quot; established a large training school for motorcyclists and mechanics in the town. In the course of the Vistula–Oder Offensive, on March 4, 1945 the Red Army and the Polish First Army captured the town, whose center was largely destroyed during the fighting.
===Post-war Poland===
Polish authorities began administering the town on March 6, 1945. The town became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the 1980s. The remaining German citizens were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

The town, initially named Drawsko, was renamed Drawsko Pomorskie by adding the adjective &quot;Pomorskie&quot; (meaning &quot;Pomeranian&quot; or &quot;in Pomerania&quot;) in 1948 to distinguish it from other Polish settlements of the same name. It was the administrative seat of a powiat until 1975. After the Local Government Reorganization Act of 1998, Drawsko became a county seat again in 1999.

<text>Minister for Women and Equalities is a ministerial position in the United Kingdom in the Department for Education. Prior to July 2024, the position led the Government Equalities Office. Its counterpart in the shadow cabinet is the shadow minister for women and equalities.

Currently the position is deputised by the role of Minister of State for Women and Equalities, formerly held by Anneliese Dodds.

The position was formerly known as; Minister for Women, Minister for Women and Equality, and Minister for Equalities.

==History==
The position of Minister for Women was created by Tony Blair when he became prime minister as a means of prioritising women&#x27;s issues across government. Prior to that, there had been an equality unit in the Cabinet Office and a Cabinet committee, which were continued under the leadership of the new minister. When Gordon Brown succeeded Blair, he created the post of Minister for Women and Equality to handle a wider range of equalities issues. The first Minister for Women and, ten years later, the first Minister for Women and Equality was Harriet Harman. On 12 October 2007 a new department, the Government Equalities Office, was created to support the minister. When David Cameron became prime minister, he renamed the position to &quot;Minister for Women and Equalities&quot; without a change in its responsibilities. Since its creation, the position has always been held by a minister sitting in Cabinet by virtue of another office (i.e., a Secretary of State or Leader of one of the Houses of Parliament).

Justine Greening replaced Nicky Morgan as both Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities when Theresa May was appointed prime minister on 13 July 2016. Morgan initially held the title of Minister for Women after the resignation of Maria Miller in April 2014, in conjunction with being Financial Secretary to the Treasury, whilst the Equalities brief was given to Sajid Javid who had replaced Miller as Secretary of State for Culture. While the Women and Equalities briefs were recombined in July 2014, the responsibility for marriage equality was assigned to Nick Boles, who held the title of Minister of State for Skills, Enterprise and Equalities and had a base in both the Education and Business departments. Both splits in responsibilities were due to Nicky Morgan having voted against the legalisation of gay marriage.

The two most recent female Prime Ministers, Theresa May and Liz Truss, served in this position.

Prior to April 2019, the minister was based at the Home Office, DFID and DfE, however, between 2019 and 2024, the position led the Government Equalities Office, an independent department within the wider Cabinet Office that had the responsibility for addressing all forms of discrimination, with particular emphasis on gender inequality. During the Conservative Government from 2017 to 2024, the minister was deputised by two parliamentary under-secretaries of state in the roles of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Women and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Equalities.

<text>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury is the official title of the most senior whip of the governing party in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Today, any official links between the Treasury and this office are nominal and the title of the office can be seen as a sinecure that allows the incumbent to draw a Government salary, attend Cabinet, and use a Downing Street residence, traditionally 12 Downing Street.

The position is currently held by Alan Campbell since July 2024.

==History==
The position of Secretary to the Treasury was created in 1660. Until 1711, there was only one Secretary to the Treasury; however, in that year, a second position was created to help deal with the increasing workload. This new position was known as the junior secretary to the Treasury, and the existing post as the senior secretary to the Treasury. Initially, when the position of Senior Secretary to the Treasury became vacant (except as the result of an election causing a change of government), the junior secretary was usually automatically promoted to the senior role. Over time, however, the roles of the Senior and Junior Secretaries began to diverge, the Senior Secretary post being used as a sinecure post for the chief whip, with no formal responsibilities to the Treasury. The junior secretary post remained a substantive position working in the Treasury. As such, the senior secretary became known as the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury while the junior secretary became known as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and the &#x27;automatic&#x27; promotion from Junior to Senior ceased. While the exact date on which this change occurred is disputed, it is agreed that the distinction was complete by 1830. In the mid-nineteenth century, the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury was referred to as the patronage secretary to the Treasury.

<text>Mercury silvering or fire gilding is a silvering technique for applying a thin layer of precious metal such as silver or gold (mercury gilding) to a base metal object. The process was invented during the Middle Ages and is documented in Vannoccio Biringuccio&#x27;s 1540 book &quot;De la pirotechnia&quot;. An amalgam of mercury and the precious metal is prepared and applied to the object which is then heated, sometimes in oil, vaporizing most of the mercury. The technique is dangerous since mercury is highly toxic, especially in its vapor phase. Mercury silvering can be detected through a variety of methods.

The technique was also used in Asia, for example &quot;tokin&quot; plating in Edo-period Japan.

Most are produced by the incomplete combustion of organic matter— by engine exhaust fumes, tobacco, incinerators, in roasted meats and cereals, or when biomass burns at lower temperatures as in forest fires. The simplest representative is naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds anthracene and phenanthrene. PAHs are uncharged, non-polar and planar. Many are colorless. Many of them are also found in fossil fuel deposits such as coal and in petroleum. Exposure to PAHs can lead to different types of cancer, to fetal development complications, and to cardiovascular issues.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are discussed as possible starting materials for abiotic syntheses of materials required by the earliest forms of life.

==Nomenclature and structure==
The terms polyaromatic hydrocarbon, or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (abbreviated as PNA) are also used for this concept.

By definition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have multiple aromatic rings, precluding benzene from being considered a PAH. Some sources, such as the US EPA and CDC, consider naphthalene to be the simplest PAH. Other authors consider PAHs to start with the tricyclic species phenanthrene and anthracene. Most authors exclude compounds that include heteroatoms in the rings, or carry substituents.

A polyaromatic hydrocarbon may have rings of various sizes, including some that are not aromatic. Those that have only six-membered rings are said to be alternant.

The following are examples of PAHs that vary in the number and arrangement of their rings:

===Geometry===
Most PAHs, like naphthalene, anthracene, and coronene, are planar. This geometry is a consequence of the fact that the σ-bonds that result from the merger of sp2 hybrid orbitals of adjacent carbons lie on the same plane as the carbon atom. Those compounds are achiral, since the plane of the molecule is a symmetry plane.

In rare cases, PAHs are not planar. In some cases, the non-planarity may be forced by the topology of the molecule and the stiffness (in length and angle) of the carbon-carbon bonds. For example, unlike coronene, corannulene adopts a bowl shape in order to reduce the bond stress. The two possible configurations, concave and convex, are separated by a relatively low energy barrier (about 11 kcal/mol).

In theory, there are 51 structural isomers of coronene that have six fused benzene rings in a cyclic sequence, with two edge carbons shared between successive rings. All of them must be non-planar and have considerable higher bonding energy (computed to be at least 130 kcal/mol) than coronene; as of 2002, none of them had been synthesized.

Other PAHs that might seem to be planar, considering only the carbon skeleton, may be distorted by repulsion or steric hindrance between the hydrogen atoms in their periphery. Benzo[c]phenanthrene, with four rings fused in a &quot;C&quot; shape, has a slight helical distortion due to repulsion between the closest pair of hydrogen atoms in the two extremal rings. This effect also causes distortion of picene.

Adding another benzene ring to form dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene creates steric hindrance between the two extreme hydrogen atoms. Adding two more rings on the same sense yields heptahelicene in which the two extreme rings overlap. These non-planar forms are chiral, and their enantiomers can be isolated.

===Benzenoid hydrocarbons===

The benzenoid hydrocarbons have been defined as condensed polycyclic unsaturated fully-conjugated hydrocarbons whose molecules are essentially planar with all rings six-membered. Full conjugation means that all carbon atoms and carbon-carbon bonds must have the sp2 structure of benzene. This class is largely a subset of the alternant PAHs, but is considered to include unstable or hypothetical compounds like triangulene or heptacene.

As of 2012, over 300 benzenoid hydrocarbons had been isolated and characterized.

==Bonding and aromaticity==

The aromaticity varies for PAHs. According to Clar&#x27;s rule, the resonance structure of a PAH that has the largest number of disjoint aromatic pi sextets—i.e. benzene-like moieties—is the most important for the characterization of the properties of that PAH.

For example, phenanthrene has two Clar structures: one with just one aromatic sextet (the middle ring), and the other with two (the first and third rings). The latter case is therefore the more characteristic electronic nature of the two. Therefore, in this molecule the outer rings have greater aromatic character whereas the central ring is less aromatic and therefore more reactive. In contrast, in anthracene the resonance structures have one sextet each, which can be at any of the three rings, and the aromaticity spreads out more evenly across the whole molecule. This difference in number of sextets is reflected in the differing ultraviolet–visible spectra of these two isomers, as higher Clar pi-sextets are associated with larger HOMO-LUMO gaps; the highest-wavelength absorbance of phenanthrene is at 293 nm, while anthracene is at 374 nm. Three Clar structures with two sextets each are present in the four-ring chrysene structure: one having sextets in the first and third rings, one in the second and fourth rings, and one in the first and fourth rings. Superposition of these structures reveals that the aromaticity in the outer rings is greater (each has a sextet in two of the three Clar structures) compared to the inner rings (each has a sextet in only one of the three).

==Properties==

===Physicochemical===
PAHs are nonpolar and lipophilic. Larger PAHs are generally insoluble in water, although some smaller PAHs are soluble. The larger members are also poorly soluble in organic solvents and in lipids. The larger members, e.g. perylene, are strongly colored.

===Redox===
Polycyclic aromatic compounds characteristically yield radicals and anions upon treatment with alkali metals. The large PAH form dianions as well. The redox potential correlates with the size of the PAH.

==Sources==

===Artificial===
The dominant sources of PAHs in the environment are from human activity: wood-burning and combustion of other biofuels such as dung or crop residues contribute more than half of annual global PAH emissions, particularly due to biofuel use in India and China. As of 2004, industrial processes and the extraction and use of fossil fuels made up slightly more than one quarter of global PAH emissions, dominating outputs in industrial countries such as the United States.

A year-long sampling campaign in Athens, Greece found a third (31%) of PAH urban air pollution to be caused by wood-burning, like diesel and oil (33%) and gasoline (29%). It also found that wood-burning is responsible for nearly half (43%) of annual PAH cancer-risk (carcinogenic potential) compared to the other sources and that wintertime PAH levels were 7 times higher than in other seasons, especially if atmospheric dispersion is low.

Lower-temperature combustion, such as tobacco smoking or wood-burning, tends to generate low molecular weight PAHs, whereas high-temperature industrial processes typically generate PAHs with higher molecular weights. Incense is also a source.

PAHs are typically found as complex mixtures.

===Natural===
====Natural fires====
PAHs may result from the incomplete combustion of organic matter in natural wildfires. Substantially higher outdoor air, soil, and water concentrations of PAHs have been measured in Asia, Africa, and Latin America than in Europe, Australia, the U.S., and Canada.

====Fossil carbon====
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are primarily found in natural sources such as bitumen.

PAHs can also be produced geologically when organic sediments are chemically transformed into fossil fuels such as oil and coal. The rare minerals idrialite, curtisite, and carpathite consist almost entirely of PAHs that originated from such sediments, that were extracted, processed, separated, and deposited by very hot fluids.
High levels of such PAHs have been detected in the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, more than 100 times the level in adjacent layers. The spike was attributed to massive fires that consumed about 20% of the terrestrial above-ground biomass in a very short time.

====Extraterrestrial====
PAHs are prevalent in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies in both the nearby and distant Universe and make up a dominant emission mechanism in the mid-infrared wavelength range, containing as much as 10% of the total integrated infrared luminosity of galaxies. PAHs generally trace regions of cold molecular gas, which are optimum environments for the formation of stars.

NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope include instruments for obtaining both images and spectra of light emitted by PAHs associated with star formation. These images can trace the surface of star-forming clouds in our own galaxy or identify star forming galaxies in the distant universe. In June 2013, PAHs were detected in the upper atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn.

====Minor sources====
Volcanic eruptions may emit PAHs.

Certain PAHs such as perylene can also be generated in anaerobic sediments from existing organic material, although it remains undetermined whether abiotic or microbial processes drive their production.

==Distribution in the environment==

===Aquatic environments===
Most PAHs are insoluble in water, which limits their mobility in the environment, although PAHs sorb to fine-grained organic-rich sediments. Aqueous solubility of PAHs decreases approximately logarithmically as molecular mass increases.

Two-ringed PAHs, and to a lesser extent three-ringed PAHs, dissolve in water, making them more available for biological uptake and degradation. Further, two- to four-ringed PAHs volatilize sufficiently to appear in the atmosphere predominantly in gaseous form, although the physical state of four-ring PAHs can depend on temperature. In contrast, compounds with five or more rings have low solubility in water and low volatility; they are therefore predominantly in solid state, bound to particulate air pollution, soils, or sediments. In solid state, these compounds are less accessible for biological uptake or degradation, increasing their persistence in the environment.

===Human exposure===
Human exposure varies across the globe and depends on factors such as smoking rates, fuel types in cooking, and pollution controls on power plants, industrial processes, and vehicles. Developed countries with stricter air and water pollution controls, cleaner sources of cooking (i.e., gas and electricity vs. coal or biofuels), and prohibitions of public smoking tend to have lower levels of PAH exposure, while developing and undeveloped countries tend to have higher levels.
Surgical smoke plumes have been proven to contain PAHs in several independent research studies.
Burning solid fuels such as coal and biofuels in the home for cooking and heating is a dominant global source of PAH emissions that in developing countries leads to high levels of exposure to indoor particulate air pollution containing PAHs, particularly for women and children who spend more time in the home or cooking.

In industrial countries, people who smoke tobacco products, or who are exposed to second-hand smoke, are among the most highly exposed groups; tobacco smoke contributes to 90% of indoor PAH levels in the homes of smokers. For the general population in developed countries, the diet is otherwise the dominant source of PAH exposure, particularly from smoking or grilling meat or consuming PAHs deposited on plant foods, especially broad-leafed vegetables, during growth. Exposure also occurs through drinking alcohol aged in charred barrels, flavored with peat smoke, or made with roasted grains. PAHs are typically at low concentrations in drinking water.
Emissions from vehicles such as cars and trucks can be a substantial outdoor source of PAHs in particulate air pollution. Geographically, major roadways are thus sources of PAHs, which may distribute in the atmosphere or deposit nearby. Catalytic converters are estimated to reduce PAH emissions from gasoline-fired vehicles by 25-fold.

People can also be occupationally exposed during work that involves fossil fuels or their derivatives, wood-burning, carbon electrodes, or exposure to diesel exhaust. Industrial activity that can produce and distribute PAHs includes aluminum, iron, and steel manufacturing; coal gasification, tar distillation, shale oil extraction; production of coke, creosote, carbon black, and calcium carbide; road paving and asphalt manufacturing; rubber tire production; manufacturing or use of metal working fluids; and activity of coal or natural gas power stations.

===Environmental pollution and degradation===

PAHs typically disperse from urban and suburban non-point sources through road runoff, sewage, and atmospheric circulation and subsequent deposition of particulate air pollution. Soil and river sediment near industrial sites such as creosote manufacturing facilities can be highly contaminated with PAHs. Oil spills, creosote, coal mining dust, and other fossil fuel sources can also distribute PAHs in the environment.

Two- and three-ringed PAHs can disperse widely while dissolved in water or as gases in the atmosphere, while PAHs with higher molecular weights can disperse locally or regionally adhered to particulate matter that is suspended in air or water until the particles land or settle out of the water column. PAHs have a strong affinity for organic carbon, and thus highly organic sediments in rivers, lakes, and the ocean can be a substantial sink for PAHs.

Algae and some invertebrates such as protozoans, mollusks, and many polychaetes have limited ability to metabolize PAHs and bioaccumulate disproportionate concentrations of PAHs in their tissues; however, PAH metabolism can vary substantially across invertebrate species. Most vertebrates metabolize and excrete PAHs relatively rapidly. Tissue concentrations of PAHs do not increase (biomagnify) from the lowest to highest levels of food chains.

PAHs transform slowly to a wide range of degradation products. Biological degradation by microbes is a dominant form of PAH transformation in the environment. Soil-consuming invertebrates such as earthworms speed PAH degradation, either through direct metabolism or by improving the conditions for microbial transformations. Abiotic degradation in the atmosphere and the top layers of surface waters can produce nitrogenated, halogenated, hydroxylated, and oxygenated PAHs; some of these compounds can be more toxic, water-soluble, and mobile than their parent PAHs.

===Urban soils===
The British Geological Survey reported the amount and distribution of PAH compounds including parent and alkylated forms in urban soils at 76 locations in Greater London. The study showed that parent (16 PAH) content ranged from 4 to 67 mg/kg (dry soil weight) and an average PAH concentration of 18 mg/kg (dry soil weight) whereas the total PAH content (33 PAH) ranged from 6 to 88 mg/kg and fluoranthene and pyrene were generally the most abundant PAHs. Benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene (B&quot;a&quot;P), the most toxic of the parent PAHs, is widely considered a key marker PAH for environmental assessments; the normal background concentration of B&quot;a&quot;P in the London urban sites was 6.9 mg/kg (dry soil weight). London soils contained more stable four- to six-ringed PAHs which were indicative of combustion and pyrolytic sources, such as coal and oil burning and traffic-sourced particulates. However, the overall distribution also suggested that the PAHs in London soils had undergone weathering and been modified by a variety of pre-and post-depositional processes such as volatilization and microbial biodegradation.

===Peatlands===
Managed burning of moorland vegetation in the UK has been shown to generate PAHs which become incorporated into the peat surface. Burning of moorland vegetation such as heather initially generates high amounts of two- and three-ringed PAHs relative to four- to six-ringed PAHs in surface sediments, however, this pattern is reversed as the lower molecular weight PAHs are attenuated by biotic decay and photodegradation. Evaluation of the PAH distributions using statistical methods such as principal component analyses (PCA) enabled the study to link the source (burnt moorland) to pathway (suspended stream sediment) to the depositional sink (reservoir bed).

===Rivers, estuarine and coastal sediments===
Concentrations of PAHs in river and estuarine sediments vary according to a variety of factors including proximity to municipal and industrial discharge points, wind direction and distance from major urban roadways, as well as tidal regime which controls the diluting effect of generally cleaner marine sediments relative to freshwater discharge. Consequently, the concentrations of pollutants in estuaries tends to decrease at the river mouth. Understanding of sediment hosted PAHs in estuaries is important for the protection of commercial fisheries (such as mussels) and general environmental habitat conservation because PAHs can impact the health of suspension and sediment feeding organism. River-estuary surface sediments in the UK tend to have a lower PAH content than sediments buried 10–60 cm from the surface reflecting lower present day industrial activity combined with improvement in environmental legislation of PAH. Typical PAH concentrations in UK estuaries range from about 19 to 16,163 µg/kg (dry sediment weight) in the River Clyde and 626 to 3,766 µg/kg in the River Mersey. In general estuarine sediments with a higher natural total organic carbon content (TOC) tend to accumulate PAHs due to high sorption capacity of organic matter. A similar correspondence between PAHs and TOC has also been observed in the sediments of tropical mangroves located on the coast of southern China.

==Human health==
Cancer is a primary human health risk of exposure to PAHs. Exposure to PAHs has also been linked with cardiovascular disease and poor fetal development.

===Cancer===
PAHs have been linked to skin, lung, bladder, liver, and stomach cancers in well-established animal model studies. Specific compounds classified by various agencies as possible or probable human carcinogens are identified in the section &quot;Regulation and Oversight&quot; below.

====History====

Historically, PAHs contributed substantially to our understanding of adverse health effects from exposures to environmental contaminants, including chemical carcinogenesis. In 1775, Percivall Pott, a surgeon at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London, observed that scrotal cancer was unusually common in chimney sweepers and proposed the cause as occupational exposure to soot. A century later, Richard von Volkmann reported increased skin cancers in workers of the coal tar industry of Germany, and by the early 1900s increased rates of cancer from exposure to soot and coal tar was widely accepted. In 1915, Yamigawa and Ichicawa were the first to experimentally produce cancers, specifically of the skin, by topically applying coal tar to rabbit ears.

In 1922, Ernest Kennaway determined that the carcinogenic component of coal tar mixtures was an organic compound consisting of only carbon and hydrogen. This component was later linked to a characteristic fluorescent pattern that was similar but not identical to benz[&quot;a&quot;]anthracene, a PAH that was subsequently demonstrated to cause tumors. Cook, Hewett and Hieger then linked the specific spectroscopic fluorescent profile of benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene to that of the carcinogenic component of coal tar, the first time that a specific compound from an environmental mixture (coal tar) was demonstrated to be carcinogenic.

In the 1930s and later, epidemiologists from Japan, the UK, and the US, including Richard Doll and various others, reported greater rates of death from lung cancer following occupational exposure to PAH-rich environments among workers in coke ovens and coal carbonization and gasification processes.

====Mechanisms of carcinogenesis====
An [[adduct]] formed between a [[DNA]] strand and an [[(+)-Benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide|epoxide derived from a benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene]] molecule (center); such adducts may interfere with normal DNA replication.
The structure of a PAH influences whether and how the individual compound is carcinogenic. Some carcinogenic PAHs are genotoxic and induce mutations that initiate cancer; others are not genotoxic and instead affect cancer promotion or progression.

PAHs that affect cancer initiation are typically first chemically modified by enzymes into metabolites that react with DNA, leading to mutations. When the DNA sequence is altered in genes that regulate cell replication, cancer can result. Mutagenic PAHs, such as benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene, usually have four or more aromatic rings as well as a &quot;bay region&quot;, a structural pocket that increases reactivity of the molecule to the metabolizing enzymes. Mutagenic metabolites of PAHs include diol epoxides, quinones, and radical PAH cations. These metabolites can bind to DNA at specific sites, forming bulky complexes called DNA adducts that can be stable or unstable. Stable adducts may lead to DNA replication errors, while unstable adducts react with the DNA strand, removing a purine base (either adenine or guanine). Such mutations, if they are not repaired, can transform genes encoding for normal cell signaling proteins into cancer-causing oncogenes. Quinones can also repeatedly generate reactive oxygen species that may independently damage DNA.

Enzymes in the cytochrome family (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1) metabolize PAHs to diol epoxides. PAH exposure can increase production of the cytochrome enzymes, allowing the enzymes to convert PAHs into mutagenic diol epoxides at greater rates. In this pathway, PAH molecules bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and activate it as a transcription factor that increases production of the cytochrome enzymes. The activity of these enzymes may at times conversely protect against PAH toxicity, which is not yet well understood.

Low molecular weight PAHs, with two to four aromatic hydrocarbon rings, are more potent as co-carcinogens during the promotional stage of cancer. In this stage, an initiated cell (a cell that has retained a carcinogenic mutation in a key gene related to cell replication) is removed from growth-suppressing signals from its neighboring cells and begins to clonally replicate. Low-molecular-weight PAHs that have bay or bay-like regions can dysregulate gap junction channels, interfering with intercellular communication, and also affect mitogen-activated protein kinases that activate transcription factors involved in cell proliferation. Closure of gap junction protein channels is a normal precursor to cell division. Excessive closure of these channels after exposure to PAHs results in removing a cell from the normal growth-regulating signals imposed by its local community of cells, thus allowing initiated cancerous cells to replicate. These PAHs do not need to be enzymatically metabolized first. Low molecular weight PAHs are prevalent in the environment, thus posing a significant risk to human health at the promotional phases of cancer.

===Cardiovascular disease===
Adult exposure to PAHs has been linked to cardiovascular disease. PAHs are among the complex suite of contaminants in tobacco smoke and particulate air pollution and may contribute to cardiovascular disease resulting from such exposures.

In laboratory experiments, animals exposed to certain PAHs have shown increased development of plaques (atherogenesis) within arteries. Potential mechanisms for the pathogenesis and development of atherosclerotic plaques may be similar to the mechanisms involved in the carcinogenic and mutagenic properties of PAHs. A leading hypothesis is that PAHs may activate the cytochrome enzyme CYP1B1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. This enzyme then metabolically processes the PAHs to quinone metabolites that bind to DNA in reactive adducts that remove purine bases. The resulting mutations may contribute to unregulated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells or to their migration to the inside of the artery, which are steps in plaque formation. These quinone metabolites also generate reactive oxygen species that may alter the activity of genes that affect plaque formation.

Oxidative stress following PAH exposure could also result in cardiovascular disease by causing inflammation, which has been recognized as an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Biomarkers of exposure to PAHs in humans have been associated with inflammatory biomarkers that are recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that oxidative stress resulting from exposure to PAHs may be a mechanism of cardiovascular disease in humans.

===Fetal development impacts===
Multiple epidemiological studies of people living in Europe, the United States, and China have linked in utero exposure to PAHs, through air pollution or parental occupational exposure, with poor fetal growth, reduced immune function, and poorer neurological development, including lower IQ.

==Regulation and oversight==
Some governmental bodies, including the European Union as well as NIOSH and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), regulate concentrations of PAHs in air, water, and soil. The European Commission has restricted concentrations of 8 carcinogenic PAHs in consumer products that contact the skin or mouth.

Priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons identified by the US EPA, the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) due to their carcinogenicity or genotoxicity and/or ability to be monitored are the following:
::Considered probable or possible human carcinogens by the US EPA, the European Union, and/or the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

==Detection and optical properties==
A spectral database exists for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. Detection of PAHs in materials is often done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography with ultraviolet-visible or fluorescence spectroscopic methods or by using rapid test PAH indicator strips. Structures of PAHs have been analyzed using infrared spectroscopy.

PAHs possess very characteristic UV absorbance spectra. These often possess many absorbance bands and are unique for each ring structure. Thus, for a set of isomers, each isomer has a different UV absorbance spectrum than the others. This is particularly useful in the identification of PAHs. Most PAHs are also fluorescent, emitting characteristic wavelengths of light when they are excited (when the molecules absorb light). The extended pi-electron electronic structures of PAHs lead to these spectra, as well as to certain large PAHs also exhibiting semi-conducting and other behaviors.

===Origins of life===

PAHs may be abundant in the universe. They seem to have been formed as early as a couple of billion years after the Big Bang, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets. More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs. PAHs are considered possible starting material for the earliest forms of life.
Light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula possesses spectral signatures that suggest the presence of anthracene and pyrene. This report was considered a controversial hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae&#x27;s cores to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. Adolf Witt and his team inferred that PAHs—which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth—can only originate in nebulae.
PAHs, subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation, and hydroxylation, to more complex organic compounds—&quot;a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively&quot;. Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons &quot;for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.&quot;

Low-temperature chemical pathways from simple organic compounds to complex PAHs are of interest. Such chemical pathways may help explain the presence of PAHs in the low-temperature atmosphere of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, and may be significant pathways, in terms of the PAH world hypothesis, in producing precursors to biochemicals related to life as we know it.

<text>Vannoccio Biringuccio, sometimes spelled Vannocio Biringuccio (c. 1480 – c. 1539), was an Italian metallurgist. He is best known for his manual on metalworking, &quot;De la pirotechnia&quot;, published posthumously in 1540.

== Biography ==
Biringuccio was born in Siena as the son of Paolo Biringuccio, presumably an architect, and Lucrezia di Bartolommeo Biringuccio. He was baptised on October 20, 1480.

He was a follower of Pandolfo Petrucci, the head of the powerful Petrucci family. Pandolfo employed him as a metallurgist. When Pandolfo died, Biringuccio remained tied to the Petrucci family, being employed by Pandolfo&#x27;s son Borghese Petrucci. However, the uprising of 1515 forced Borghese to flee from Siena, taking Biringuccio with him. Biringuccio traveled about Italy, and visited Sicily in 1517.

In 1523 Pope Clement VII caused the reinstatement of the Petrucci family, and along with them Biringuccio was able to return from exile. In 1524 he was granted a monopoly on the production of saltpeter across all of Siena. However, this was short lived—in 1526, the people of Siena revolted and threw the Petrucci family out again. The family made an attempt (aided by Biringuccio) to regain Siena by force, but it failed.

In 1530, Siena entered a more peaceful phase, and Biringuccio returned. He was a Senator of the city in January and February 1531, and took part in various projects.

In 1536, he was offered a job in Rome by the Church, and in 1538 he became head of the papal foundry, and director of munitions.

His exact place and date of death is unknown; all that is known is that a document dated 1539 mentions his death.

== Work ==

Biringuccio is considered by some as the father of the foundry industry, as his &quot;De la pirotechnia&quot; is the first printed account of proper foundry practice. It also gives details of mining practice, the extraction and refining of numerous metals, alloys such as brass, and compounds used in foundries and explosives. It preceded the printing of &quot;De re metallica&quot; by Georgius Agricola by 14 years.

Biringuccio was a member of the secretive guild &quot;Fraternità di Santa Barbara&quot;. Before his book&#x27;s publication, information on metallurgy and military arts were closely held secrets; his book is credited with starting the tradition of scientific and technical literature.

In his career, he was in charge of an iron mine near Siena, and also in charge of its mint and arsenal. He was in charge of casting cannons for Venice and later Florence.

===De la pirotechnia===

The work is one of earliest technical manuscripts to survive from the Renaissance, and is thus a valuable source of information on technical practice at the time of writing. The work was printed in 1540 in Venice, and has been reprinted numerous times.

It is divided into ten books dealing with minerals, semi-minerals, assaying, smelting, the separation of gold from silver, alloys, the art of casting metals (especially bells and cannons), and alchemy. He describes in detail the way moulds are made for casting so as to avoid defects, including the way patterns are made for the final product shape.

The magazine is known for its combination of high-quality photography and depiction of sex acts typical of hardcore pornography such as anal sex, an innovation at the time of its creation. The American pornographer Al Goldstein described it as &quot;[the] best porno magazine in the world&quot;.

The magazine was created in 1965 by the Swedish photographer Berth Milton Sr., who initially included his pornographic photographs in erotic magazines, which he distributed in his bookshop in Stockholm. He sold the first issues of his magazine himself to newspaper kiosks, since there was no distribution for such magazines. 

After the 1966 United States Supreme Court decision &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot;, the prohibition of pornography in the United States was questioned for the first time. The magazine, previously distributed under the counter in the United States, has since been sold openly there and, from its ninth issue, is considered the United States&#x27; first legally distributed pornographic magazine. 

Since the mid-1980s, Private has been published in Barcelona, Spain, which was the second largest market for pornographic products after Germany. The magazine became the best-selling pornographic magazine in the world, before losing importance in the course of the digitalization of pornography in the 1990s. 

Private Media Group was founded in 1991 by Berth Milton Jr. who extended the &quot;Private&quot; brand by adding web offerings to the portfolio, expanded video production and successfully took the company public. The magazine &quot;Private&quot;, which forms the cornerstone of the company, continues to this day.

The erotic art book publisher Taschen has published two collections, each in five volumes, featuring photographic works published in &quot;Private&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s.

<text>The Carpetbaggers is a 1961 bestselling novel by Harold Robbins, which was adapted into a 1964 film of the same title. The prequel &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966) was also based on a character in the novel.

In the United States, the term &quot;carpetbagger&quot; refers to an outsider relocating to exploit locals. It derives from postbellum Southern United States usage, where it referred specifically to opportunistic Northerners who flocked to the occupied southern states in hopes of increasing their political, financial and social power during the Reconstruction era. In Robbins&#x27; novel, the exploited territory is the film industry, and the newcomer is a wealthy heir to an industrial fortune who, like Howard Hughes, simultaneously pursued aviation and filmmaking avocations.

==&quot;Roman à clef&quot;==
Ian Parker described the book as &quot;a &quot;roman à clef&quot; — it was generally thought to have been inspired by the life of Howard Hughes&quot;. In an interview with Dick Lochte, Robbins said, &quot;The airplane manufacturer in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; was Bill Lear, not Howard Hughes, by the way.&quot; &quot;TV Guide Online&quot;″s capsule summary of the movie says, however, &quot;Deny it though he might, Harold Robbins obviously used parts of the life of Howard Hughes as the basis for his major character, Jonas Cord.&quot; Lear, the developer of the Lear jet and the 8-track tape player, was better known as an engineer rather than as an aviator, and had no connection with Hollywood.

Parallels between Cord and Hughes include:

* Cord is the heir to his father&#x27;s Cord Explosives Company, Hughes to his father&#x27;s Hughes Tool Company.
* Cord personally sets aviation records, as did Hughes.
* Much of the novel concerns itself with Cord&#x27;s ventures into film production; Hughes produced 26 films.
* Cord owns an airline named ICA; Hughes owned TWA.
* Cord personally pilots a gigantic flying boat called the Centurion, &quot;the biggest airplane ever built&quot;, to prove its airworthiness in order to meet a naval contract condition. Hughes personally piloted the Hughes H-4 Hercules or Spruce Goose, by some criteria the largest aircraft ever built, to prove its airworthiness in order to deflect Congressional criticism of his war contracts.

Ian Parker and others identify the character Rina Marlowe with Jean Harlow, whom Howard Hughes had under personal contract for a few years and who many believe had an affair with Hughes; although actual evidence of such an affair is patchy at best, and Harlow often complained about Hughes making a fortune loaning her to other studios and paying her a paltry salary (her contract with Hughes was eventually bought out by MGM). Carroll Baker, the actress who played Rina in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;, was chosen a year later to play the title role in the biopic &quot;Harlow&quot;. Fictional Rina Marlowe&#x27;s husband, cinema director Claude Dunbar, commits suicide shortly after their marriage, as did Jean Harlow&#x27;s second husband, producer Paul Bern. Marlowe dies tragically of encephalitis in about 1934; Harlow died of kidney failure in 1937.

In other respects, correspondences between the novel&#x27;s characters and real individuals are imprecise. In the novel, Jonas Cord&#x27;s first movie production is entitled &quot;The Renegade&quot;; is released in 1930; and stars Rina Marlowe in her screen debut. Marlowe has a 38C bust, and Cord has one of his aeronautical engineers design a special brassiere for her. There is a brief reference to his producing a movie four years later entitled &quot;Devils in the Sky&quot;. These movie titles bear an unmistakable similarity to two movies produced and directed by Hughes: &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (1943) and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930).

&quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; starred Jean Harlow, but it was not her debut; she was an established actress with seventeen earlier screen credits. Jean Harlow was famous as (in the words of her official estate-sponsored website) &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Original Blonde Bombshell&quot;, but her bust measurement was not extraordinary. The real-life person who &quot;did&quot; make her screen debut as a star, &quot;was&quot; famous for her large bust, and for whom Hughes really &quot;did&quot; have an engineer design a special brassiere, was Hughes&#x27; later discovery (and model for the character Jennie Denton) Jane Russell, who starred in &quot;The Outlaw&quot;.

The names of real people whom Robbins&#x27; fictional characters resemble are often mentioned briefly within the novel, potentially further confusing the situation. When Rina Marlowe dies, a studio official says that, to replace Marlowe in an upcoming picture, &quot;I&#x27;m already talking to Metro about getting Jean Harlow.&quot; A fictional Charles Standhurst, who owns &quot;more than twenty newspapers stretched across the nation&quot;, is said to be &quot;second only to Hearst&quot;.

The character Nevada Smith is a cowboy who breaks into the movies by volunteering to perform a risky stunt, becomes fabulously wealthy as a movie cowboy star, and becomes proprietor of a Wild West show. In these details he bears a vague resemblance to Tom Mix, who was a star performer in the 101 Wild West Show and became in turn a movie extra, stuntman, and major star. Some also see a resemblance between Nevada Smith and William Boyd, who became famous as Hopalong Cassidy. Others say that Smith was based on cowboy actor Ken Maynard. A movie entitled &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966) starring Steve McQueen was based on Smith&#x27;s role in this book. The role of Billy the Kid in Hughes&#x27; &quot;The Outlaw&quot; was played by Jack Buetel, who prior to his movie career was neither an outlaw nor a cowboy, but an insurance clerk.

==Reviews==
Murray Schumach&#x27;s review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on June 25, 1961, opens: &quot;It was not quite proper to have printed &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; between covers of a book. It should have been inscribed on the walls of a public lavatory.&quot; He complains that the plot is merely &quot;an excuse for a collection of monotonous episodes about normal and abnormal sex—and violence ranging from simple battery to gruesome varieties of murder&quot;.

On the day the review was published, &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; was already at number nine on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. The most successful of Robbins&#x27; books, it had sold over eight million copies by 2004. The profile of Robbins in Gale&#x27;s &quot;Contemporary Authors Online&quot; claims that &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; &quot;is estimated to be the fourth most-read book in history&quot;.

==Artifact of the sexual revolution==
&quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; was published at the onset of the sexual revolution. Only two years earlier, the U.S. Postmaster General had banned D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; from the mails as obscene. In 1960, publisher Grove Press won the Supreme Court case contesting the ban, but even in 1961 booksellers all over the country were sued for selling Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. Parker quotes a professor of English as saying &quot;&quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; could have sent any retailer handling it to prison before 1960.&quot;

&quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; never landed in court, but it did vigorously (and profitably) exploit the territory that Grove Press had opened up. On the second page of the novel, as aviator Jonas Cord approaches the landing strip of his father&#x27;s explosives factory, Robbins writes: &quot;The black roof of the plant lay on the white sand like a girl on the white sheets of a bed, the dark pubic patch of her whispering its invitation into the dimness of the night.&quot; In 1961, this was explosive indeed. (Paradoxically, the words &quot;pubic patch&quot; are omitted in some recent editions published in the United Kingdom.)

In 1963, while it may have been just within bounds in the United States, it was still one of 188 books prohibited from import into Australia, along with Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot;, D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, Grace Metalious&#x27;s &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, and no fewer than seven books by Henry Miller.

==In popular culture==
In the film &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot; (1966), Harry Hinkle (Jack Lemmon) carries a hardcover copy of the novel into his bedroom. Insurance investigators are covertly listening. 
In the novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1967), Ponyboy Curtis mentions that his elder brother Darry has a copy of the novel, which Ponyboy states he has read, despite Darry saying he is too young.

<doc id="653019" wikidata="Q6644196" url="?curid=653019" title="List of unaccredited institutions of higher education">
<text>This is a list of colleges, seminaries, and universities that do not have educational accreditation. In many countries, accreditation is defined as a governmental designation.

Degrees or other qualifications from unaccredited institutions may not be accepted by civil service or other employers. Some unaccredited institutions have formal legal authorization to enroll students or issue degrees, but in some jurisdictions (notably including the United States) legal authorization to operate is not the same as educational accreditation.

Institutions that appear on this list are those that have granted post-secondary academic degrees or advertised the granting of such degrees, but which are listed as unaccredited by a . There are several reasons for an institution not maintaining accreditation. A new institution may not yet have attained accreditation, while a long-established institution may have lost accreditation because of financial difficulties or other factors. Some unaccredited institutions are fraudulent diploma mills. Other institutions (for example, a number of Bible colleges and seminaries) choose not to participate in the accreditation process because they view it as an infringement of their religious, academic, or political freedom. Some government jurisdictions exempt religious institutions from accreditation or other forms of government oversight. Still other institutions are not required to have accreditation.

Some of the institutions on this list are no longer in operation. Several unaccredited universities have names that are similar to those of accredited institutions, and thus some persons may be misled into thinking that an entity is an accredited university. Accreditation is date-related: in the United States, colleges and universities are typically not fully accredited until several years after they open. Also in the United States, many colleges and universities existed prior to the development of the modern accreditation system.

There are many organizations which give their own accreditation, not generally recognised as valid by governments and others, to educational institutions. Many of these are listed in the article List of unrecognized higher education accreditation organizations. Some of the educational institutions listed here claim accreditation from such organizations.

<text>A sticker is a type of label: a piece of printed paper, plastic, vinyl, or other material with temporary or permanent pressure sensitive adhesive on one side. It can be used for decoration or for functional purposes, depending on the situation.

Stickers can come in many different shapes and sizes and also vary widely in color and design. They are often adhered to items such as lunchboxes, paper, lockers, notebooks, walls, cars, windows, used as name tags, and so on. 

The term &quot;sticker price&quot; refers to the historic practice of adhering a large sticker to the window of a new car listing its base price, options, shipping charges, etc. (from which a discount was often negotiated).

== History ==
Early renditions of the modern-day sticker would be present during Ancient Egypt, made of bone and ivory tags, to be used to label items for burial. Earliest rendition dating back to 3200 B.C. in connection to the burial of King Scorpion I, with the labels used to detail the contents within and the organization and place it was gifted from. 

By the 1880s paper labels would be able to be placed with a gum paste that needed to be moistened with water to activate adhesive its ability that could be placed on most surfaces.

R. Stanton Avery is credited with creating the first self-adhesive sticker in 1935, with commercial sale in 1940 under the name &quot;Kum Kleen Price Stickers&quot;, under the former &quot;Avery Adhesives&quot; company in Downtown Los Angeles, where its original use was for labeling on various goods and products. 

== Use ==
Stickers are widely used when an object requires identification with a word or idea. Brand stickers may be attached to products to label these products as coming from a certain company. They may also be used to describe characteristics of the products that would not be obvious from simple examination, or to clarify either a printing error or change in the product of some kind, such as the country of origination, shift in a product&#x27;s ingredients, a shelf life date, or copyright notice, without having to scrap pre-existing packaging for such a small change. A label dispenser is often used as a convenient way to separate the sticky label from its liner or backing tape.

Stickers placed on automobile bumpers, magnetic and permanent, called &quot;bumper stickers&quot;, are often used by individuals as a way of demonstrating support for political or ideological causes. Identification of vehicle registration and last service details are two examples of stickers on the inside of most car windscreens. The term &quot;window sticker&quot; is generally used for vinyl labels which are stuck to the inside of a vehicle&#x27;s window, as opposed to water-resistant stickers that are stuck to the outside of a vehicle but can be affixed to anything.

Stickers are also used for embellishing scrapbooking pages. Kinds of stickers sold for this purpose include acrylic, 3D, cardstock, epoxy, fabric, flocked, sparkly, paper, puffy, and vellum. While in the earlier days of scrapbooking stickers were sold mostly on 2&quot;x6&quot; sheets, now 6&quot;x12&quot; and even 12&quot;x12&quot; size sheets are very common.

They are frequently distributed as part of promotional, and political campaigns; for example, in many voting districts in the U.S., stickers indicating an individual has voted are given to each voter as they leave the polling place, largely as a reminder to others to vote. Observers may clap hands, honk a horn or otherwise applaud a good sticker.

In the 16th century French aristocracy wore stickers on their face to hide blemishes.

Temporary stickers are used today to indicate whether someone is free of certain health symptoms, been vaccinated, or otherwise cleared some security protocol.

Stickers are also used as a form of guerilla marketing, as well as serving as a ubiquitous form of visual and physical vandalism.

Stickers are also printed for use as temporary tattoos.

=== Discount stickers ===
== Collecting ==
At their simplest stickers can be beginner-friendly collectables, serving as a gateway to the collecting hobby.

Forming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, Panini first produced a World Cup sticker album for the 1970 World Cup. Initiating a craze for collecting and trading stickers, since then, collecting and trading stickers has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation. UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; states, &quot;the tradition of swapping duplicate [World Cup] stickers was a playground fixture during the 1970s and 1980s.&quot;

<text>Richard Glenn Rutan (July 1, 1938 – May 3, 2024) was an American military aviator and officer, as well as a record-breaking test pilot who in 1986 piloted the Voyager aircraft on the first non-stop, non-refueled around-the-world flight with co-pilot Jeana Yeager. He was the older brother of famed aerospace designer Burt Rutan, whose many earlier original designs Dick piloted on class record-breaking flights, including Voyager.

== Life and career ==
Rutan was born and raised in Loma Linda, California, where he gained an interest in aviation at a young age. He learned to fly at age 15, taking his first solo flight on his 16th birthday, and later attended Reedley Junior College while waiting to report for the military. At Reedley College, he worked with aircraft engines toward getting an official FAA power plant license (also referred to as an Aviation Maintenance Technician). Through his interest in piloting, he went on to earn commercial, instrument, multiengine, seaplane and instructor certificates.

===U.S. Air Force===
After completing the Radar Intercept Officer Course, Rutan served as a McDonnell F-101B Voodoo Radar Intercept Officer with the 322d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Kingsley Field, Oregon, from December 1959 to September 1961, and then as a Northrop F-89 Scorpion Radar Intercept Officer with the 57th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Keflavik Airport, Iceland, from September 1961 to October 1962. His next assignment was as a Douglas C-124 Globemaster II navigator with the 85th Air Transport Squadron at Travis AFB, California, from October 1962 to November 1965. He underwent Undergraduate Pilot Training, earning his Pilot Wings at Laughlin AFB, Texas, in December 1966.
===Vietnam War===
Rutan served during the Vietnam War as one of the founding members of the &quot;Mistys&quot; of Operation Commando Sabre, pioneering the use of tactical jets as a &quot;FastFAC&quot; (known as forward air control) for the FAC Airborne mission, which searched for and marked targets with white phosphorus rockets ahead of the strike package. He flew 325 missions but had to eject one time, when his North American F-100 Super Sabre aircraft was hit.

===After the war===
His next assignment was as an F-100 pilot with the 492nd Tactical Fighter Squadron and as a Flight Test Maintenance Officer with the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, England, from November 1968 to April 1972. Rutan had to eject a second time in his Air Force career when his aircraft suffered an engine failure over England.
Rutan then served as a Flight Test Maintenance Officer with the 3030th Support Squadron at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, from April 1972 to May 1975, followed by service as an LTV A-7 Corsair II pilot and Commander of the 355th Field Maintenance Squadron at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, from May 1975 to August 1976. After completing an Operation Bootstrap degree program, Rutan served as Chief of the Training Division with the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing at Davis-Monthan AFB from January 1977 until his retirement from the Air Force on June 1, 1978.

During his career with the Air Force, Rutan was awarded the Silver Star, five Distinguished Flying Crosses, 16 Air Medals, and a Purple Heart. He retired from the Air Force in 1978 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

===Post military career===
Rutan also acted as a test pilot throughout his career, flying multiple designs such as the Fairchild T-46 in 1981 and the XCOR EZ-Rocket in 2001.

From December 14 to 23, 1986, Rutan flew with Jeana Yeager on the first unrefueled non-stop flight around the world in the Rutan Voyager, a design by his brother Burt. The flight took 9 days, 3 minutes, and 44 seconds and covered 24,986 miles (40,211 km). It attracted world wide media coverage and set multiple records. That same year, Yeager and the Rutan brothers were awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club, the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Ronald Reagan, and the Collier Trophy for their achievement.

In 1997, Dick Rutan and Mike Melvill flew two personally-built Rutan Long-EZ kit aircraft side-by-side around the world. This &quot;around the world in 80 nights&quot; flight was called The Spirit of EAA Friendship World Tour, and some legs of it lasted for over 14 hours.

On December 3, 2005, in the XCOR EZ-Rocket, Rutan set the point-to-point distance record for a ground-launched, rocket-powered aircraft, flying 16 km from Mojave, California, to California City, California, in just under ten minutes. This was also the first official delivery of U.S. Mail by a rocket-powered aircraft. In recognition of this achievement, the FAI awarded Rutan the 2005 Louis Blériot Medal.

==Congressional campaign==
In 1992, Rutan ran as a conservative Republican against Democratic congressman George Brown, Jr. in California&#x27;s 42nd congressional district, consisting mostly of the San Bernardino region of southern California and viewed as a swing district. In the Republican primary, Rutan upset San Bernardino County Supervisor Rob Hammock, who had run a strong race against Brown in 1990. In the general election, Rutan ran on a platform that called for reforming Congress and lowering taxes. Brown, first elected in 1962, was long known for surviving close elections and prevailed with 79,780 votes (50.7%) to Rutan&#x27;s 69,251 (44%). Fritz Ward, a Libertarian, received 8,424 votes or 5.3% of the vote.

Rutan died from pulmonary fibrosis as a complication of long COVID on May 3, 2024, in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho. He was 85.

==Records==
Besides the records Rutan set while flying the XCOR EZ-Rocket, which consisted of a point-to-point distance record and being the first official delivery of U.S. Mail by a rocket-powered aircraft, and while flying &quot;Voyager&quot;, which consisted of multiple absolute distance records, an airspeed record, and being the first plane to fly non-stop and unrefueled around the world, more than doubling the old distance record set by a Boeing B-52 strategic bomber in 1962, he also set a number in his personal Rutan VariEze and Long-EZ, including:

*FAI class C1b distance over a closed course of 2,636 km at Oshkosh, Wisconsin circa July–August 1975
*FAI class C1b distance over a closed course of 7,725.3 km at Mojave, California on December 15, 1979
*FAI class C1b distance of 7,344.56 km from Anchorage, Alaska to Grand Turk Island on June 5, 1981

Rutan believed that by engaging in a program of breaking class records he could further fine-tune his brother&#x27;s homebuilt aircraft designs.

<doc id="653035" wikidata="Q798283" url="?curid=653035" title="Kalambo Falls">
<text>The Kalambo Falls on the Kalambo River is a single-drop waterfall on the border of Zambia and Rukwa Region, Tanzania at the southeast end of Lake Tanganyika. The falls are some of the tallest uninterrupted falls in Africa (after South Africa&#x27;s Tugela Falls, Ethiopia&#x27;s Jin Bahir Falls and others). Downstream of the falls is the Kalambo Gorge, which has a width of about 1 km and a depth of up to 300 m, running for about 5 km before opening out into the Lake Tanganyika rift valley. The Kalambo waterfall is the tallest waterfall in both Tanzania and Zambia. The expedition which mapped the falls and the area around it was in 1928 and led by Enid Gordon-Gallien. Initially it was assumed that the height of falls exceeded 300 m, but measurements in the 1920s gave a more modest result, above 200 m. Later measurements, in 1956, gave a result of 221 m. After this several more measurements have been made, each with slightly different results. The width of the falls is 3.6–18 m.

Kalambo Falls is also considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Africa, with occupation spanning over 447,000 years. In 2023, archaeologists announced the discovery of wooden structures estimated to be 476,000 years old at the falls, predating &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Two worked wooden beams display evidence that burning was used to create an interlocking wooden structure, possibly a platform by what would have then been a water source for the early hominid residents. This is the earliest known hominid structure.

==Archaeology==
Archaeologically, Kalambo Falls is one of the most important sites in Africa. It has produced a sequence of past human activity stretching over more than two hundred and fifty thousand years, with evidence of continuous habitation since the Late Early Stone Age until modern times. It was first excavated in 1953 by John Desmond (J.D.) Clark who recognized archaeological activity around a small basin lake upstream of the falls. Excavations in 1953, 1956, 1959, and 1963 allowed Clark to make conclusions about the multiple different cultures inhabiting the area over thousands of years of time.

== Pleistocene environmental reconstruction ==

J.D. Clark&#x27;s work incorporated both questions of the cultures who lived at the Kalambo Falls site as well as what their environment was like during times of occupation. Using plant (floral) and pollen analyses, Clark was able to conduct the process of paleoenvironmental reconstruction. By studying pollen that settled on the earth during different environmental settings, Clark was able to form a general idea of what ecological factors affected the Kalambo Falls region at different times. In order to do this, Clark used a tool for drawing out sediment cores in order to observe and analyse the different layers below the surface of the earth today. He separated these layers into 6 different spectra, labeled zones U through Z. The law of superposition is important to note when discussing sedimentary layers; this law states that more recent layers of soil dispersal will overlie older ones.

Zone U The bottom of Clark&#x27;s core sample is the oldest layer. Pollen samples collected indicate that swamp vegetation and an abundance of grass grew on the Kalambo River. The tests also indicated that the surrounding woodland grew during dry and hot climates. Clark concludes that the ground-water levels must have been high in order for a swamp and fringing, or riparian forest, to grow along the water&#x27;s edge during a period of reduced rainfall.

Zone V Pollen collected from the next zone indicate an identical environment with the swamp and woodland vegetation that was not affected by climate conditions, such as the drop of 3° Celsius (C) in the area.

Zone W Pollen of plants that grow in more open areas with more rainfall were taken from Zone W. This indicates an increase in rainfall to about 75–100 cm and a woodland with an open canopy to allow that rainfall to reach the ground below.

Zone X Clark indicates that the study of this zone was only on one sample drawn from the soil below, so the conclusions are not finite in his study. Plants indicated show a fringing forest that was poorly developed with a very open woodland. Within these woodland conditions, there seems to be an influence of evergreen elements that emerged.

Zone Y Clark was able to date this zone to approximately 27,000 to 30,000 years ago, because conditions were comparable to those dated in European soils from this time. Evidence of an increase in rainfall and a temperature drop of 4.1 °C with a fringing forest that was well developed with the return of swamp plants is indicated in the pollen collected.

Zone Z The final zone indicates a much poorer fringing forest and a reduced shift of vegetation growth at the time.

== Culture history of the site ==

=== Early Stone Age ===
The Early Stone Age is described by Barham and Mitchell as the time period where the ancient ancestors of &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot; first emerged, branching from the &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;, evolving into &quot;Homo habilis&quot; and then &quot;Homo erectus&quot; 2.6 million years ago to 280,000 years ago&quot;.&quot; Archaeologists hypothesize that the technological progression over time can be examined in the morphological characteristics of tools that are associated with different eras of habitation. The earliest identified stone tools, made by &quot;Homo habilis&quot; are known as Oldowan tools, and they consist of the basic large pounding stones and small pebble flakes, known as Mode 1 technology. As time progressed and &quot;Homo habilis&quot; evolved into &quot;Homo erectus,&quot; so did the technology as more specialized stone tools were being developed, even tools that were used for making other tools, Mode 2 and 3 technologies.

These Late Acheulean stone tools, along with hearths and well-preserved organic objects were found at Kalambo Falls and documented by JD Clark. These organic artifacts collected included a wooden club and digging sticks as well as the dietary evidence for fruit consumption. Tools excavated from Kalambo Gorge have been analyzed and OSL dating of quartzite within the soil context to between 500,000 and 50,000 years ago, with amino acid racemization dating some contexts to 100,000 years ago. 

In 2023, archaeologists announced the discovery of wooden structures and other wooden artifacts, which were determined to be at least 476,000 years old using luminescence dating. The discovery predates &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, so the tools may have potentially been made by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;, of which a 300,000 year old skull was found at another Zambian site. The discovery was considered unusual because wood does not usually survive for so long. Archaeologists such as Larry Barham of the University of Liverpool, one of the discoverers of the wooden structures, believes that wooden tools were potentially even more common than stone tools in the Stone Age, but due to wood decaying quickly in the ground archaeologists could not find such tools.

=== Middle Stone Age ===
The Middle Stone Age, dated at 280,000 years ago to roughly 40,000 years ago, is the period where the final stages of hominid evolution brought what is known today as &quot;modern human behavior&quot;.

During this time, the Acheulean industry of Kalambo Falls was superseded by the Sangoan culture. This shift is considered by Clark as a result of an ecological shift to a cooler and wetter climate. It is at this time in the archaeological record that the large, Acheulean handaxe disappears and is replaced by the core axe and chopping tools characteristic of Sangoan technologies. Heavy woodworking tools and small, notched and denticulated tools, collected by Clark, were dated to have been made before 41,000 BC. This rapid change is predicted to be a result of population movement during this time period, as the &quot;Acheulean man&quot; who lived in open settlements were replaced by a culture associated with &quot;Homo rhodesiensis&quot; found at Kabwe mine, the Sangoan culture. Evidence of Sangoan habitation has been collected from less open Rock Shelters and Cave areas, possibly due to the persisting, wetter climate.

Evidence of fire technologies, such as hearths, charred logs, reddened clay, and stone heat spalls were also collected and found in association with charcoal remains. Radiocarbon dates of the scattered charcoal indicate people were using fire systematically there some 60,000 years ago.

The cool, wet climates of the region were similar to that of the Congo, and similar cultural practices have been identified at Kalambo Falls, known as Lupemban industries. Evidence suggests that the Sangoan tradition was replaced by the Lupemban industry around 250,000 years ago and continued through to 117,000 years ago. It is characterized by two-sided, or bifacial, stone tools like core axes and double-ended points that were possibly for hafting as spearheads. Geological studies by J.D. Clark indicate that the frequency of these tools is possibly due to factors that exemplified the amount of large pieces of breakable, or knappable, raw materials.

=== Later Stone Age ===
The Later Stone Age is the final age of the Paleolithic Era of Africa, and generally refers to more recent hunter/gatherer sites. Around 10,000 years ago Kalambo Falls was occupied by the Magosian culture which in turn gave way to Wilton activity.

=== Iron Age and the Luangwa tradition ===
Around the fourth century AD, a more industrialized Bantu-speaking people began to farm and occupy the area. These Bantu-speaking people made ceramic vessels that have characteristics of East African pottery, which suggests a population movement from the Rift Valley. Burials from this period are characterized by Clark as shaft grave burials, which are similar to those of the earlier cultures of the East African Rift as opposed to the Kalambo region.

The Iron Age in Zambia is split into an earlier, regionally categorized period and a later period of materialistically differing traditions. Early assemblages of iron tools and pottery have been collected from the Kalambo Falls and are categorized as being from the Kalambo Group tradition. At Kalambo falls, Early Iron Age traditions are believed to have continued into the 11th century.

In 1971, Robert C. Soper studied different assemblages of Iron Age pottery in eastern and southern Africa and consolidated them into two major groups, known as Urewe and Kwale wares. He indicated that Kalambo and Mwabulambo pot traditions may also be included in these. David W. Phillipson used these conclusions to form a north to south chronology of artifacts and comprised many of the groups studied by Soper into one, Mwitu tradition. This tradition is exhibited by pots that range from the first millennium AD.

The Kalambo group was replaced by the Luangwa tradition, whose pottery is similar to the Early Iron Age Chondwe Group of the Central African Copperbelt. Luangwa Pottery is characteristic of necked pots and shallow bowls, with the most common comb-stamped decoration pressed in a horizontal pattern of delineated lines. There has yet to be found any evidence for an interface between this Luangwa tradition and the Early Iron Age tradition at Kalambo Falls, whereas sites at the Eastern Province of Zambia exhibit this interrelationship. Exact dates for this transition in the Kalambo area are inconclusive, but the tradition has continued through to the present.

Attempts to date artifacts from Kalambo Falls have resulted in inconsistent results, ranging from 110,000 years ago with racemization to 182,000 ±10,000 to 76,000 ±10,000 years ago with applied uranium series dating. These studies underscore the difficulty in establishing a chronology for human habitation at the falls, which has led some archaeologists to disregard its significance in the African archaeological record.

However, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) on quartz artifacts has recently improved understanding of the site&#x27;s chronology. OSL works by sending signals through a crystalline material and collects data on how long ago the stone was exposed to light or heat.

OSL results have led to the creation of a new chronology for the site, broken into six stages. Stage 1 ranges between approximately 500,000 to 300,000 years ago. Stage 2 ranges from 300,000 to 50,000 years ago. Stage 3 dates range from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago. Stage 4 deposits date to 1,500 to 500 years ago and Stage 5 follows after 490 years ago.

Acheulean stone tools (Mode 2 and 3 technologies) were collected from stratigraphic layers corresponding to the first and second stages. More complex Mode 3 tools came from the first three stages and are also found in Stage 4, whose corresponding layers contain a mix of Stone and Iron Age artifacts.

== Zambia and UNESCO significance ==
In 1964, the archaeological site was gazetted as a national monument by Zambia&#x27;s National Heritage Conservation Commission. It has since been protected under Zambia&#x27;s 1989 National Heritage Conservation Act.

In 2009, Kalambo Falls was included on UNESCO list of tentative World Heritage Sites. Justifications for the inclusion are that the Kalambo Falls are the 2nd highest waterfalls in Africa, the evidence of one of the longest examples of human occupation in sub-Saharan Africa, and the collected stone tools are from one of the world&#x27;s earliest tool industries, the Acheulean.

As of today, Kalambo Falls remains on the tentative list for recognition as a protected World Heritage site.

==Contemporary ecology==
Today, both human and animal populations traverse the Kalambo Falls area, which has a basin above the falls that attracts many of both populations as an important stopping place. On the Zambian border, the area is now a game preserve for the protection of many animals. The falls&#x27; cliff-face ledges provide nesting places and breeding sites for a marabou stork colony.

<doc id="653038" wikidata="Q11250358" url="?curid=653038" title="List of current United States governors">
<text>The United States has 50 states and 5 territories that each elect a governor to serve as chief executive of the state or territorial government. The sole federal district, the District of Columbia, elects a mayor to oversee its government in a similar manner. In the event of a vacancy, the governor is succeeded by the second-highest-ranking state official; in 45 states and 4 territories, the lieutenant governor is the first in the line of succession.

, there are 27 states with Republican governors and 23 states with Democratic governors. Both Republicans and Democrats control 2 territorial governorships. Jenniffer González-Colón of Puerto Rico is a member of the New Progressive Party, although she is also affiliated with the Republican Party. The federal District of Columbia is governed by a Democratic mayor.

The current gubernatorial term ends and new term begins in January for most states and territories, two months after their election; in Alaska, Hawaii, North Dakota, and Kentucky, the term begins in December. Governors serve four-year terms in most states and all territories; New Hampshire and Vermont have two-year terms for their governors. Most states and all but one territory also have term limits that generally allow for two consecutive terms to be served by a candidate. To run for governor, a candidate must generally be a U.S. citizen with prior state residence who meets the minimum age requirement—set at 30 years old in 35 states.

All 55 governors are members of the National Governors Association, a non-partisan organization which represents states and territories in discussions with the federal government. Other organizations for governors include the partisan Democratic Governors Association and Republican Governors Association; and the three regional associations: Midwestern, Northeastern, and Western.

==State governors==

The longest serving incumbent U.S. governor is Greg Abbott of Texas, who took office on January 20, 2015. The most recently inaugurated governor is Larry Rhoden of South Dakota, who took office on January 25, 2025. A total of 15 current governors previously served as lieutenant governor, while 11 previously served in the United States House of Representatives. The governor&#x27;s office has term limits in 37 states and 4 territories; these terms are four years except in New Hampshire and Vermont, where governors serve two-year terms.

The average age of governors at the time of their inauguration was about 59 years old. Alabama governor Kay Ivey (born 1944) is the oldest current governor, and Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders (born 1982) is the youngest. As of January 2025, there are 12 female state governors serving. Of the 50 state governors, 47 are non-Hispanic white, one is Hispanic (Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico), one is Black (Wes Moore of Maryland), and one is Native American (Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma).

The notation &quot;(term limits)&quot; after the year indicates that the governor is ineligible to seek re-election in that year; the notation &quot;(retiring)&quot; indicates that the governor has announced his or her intention not to seek re-election at the end of the term nor to run for another office.

==Territory governors==

==Federal district mayor==

The District of Columbia is a federal district that elects a mayor that has similar powers to those of a state or territorial governor. The cities of Washington and Georgetown within the district elected their own mayors until 1871, when their governments were consolidated into a reorganized District of Columbia by a Congressional act. The district&#x27;s chief executive from 1871 to 1874 was a governor appointed by the president of the United States; the office was replaced by a board of commissioners with three members appointed by the president—two residents and a representative from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Board of Commissioners was originally a temporary body but was made permanent in 1878 with one member selected to serve as the Board President, in effect the city&#x27;s chief executive. The system was replaced in 1967 by a single mayor–commissioner and home rule in the District of Columbia was fully restored in 1975 under a reorganized government led by an elected mayor.

<text>David Daniel Lowman (1921-1999) was a National Security Agency employee, an expert witness in the case that overturned Hirabayashi v. United States, and the author of the posthumously published book &quot;MAGIC: The Untold Story of U.S. Intelligence and the Evacuation of Japanese Residents from the West Coast during World War II&quot;.

== Biography ==
Lowman was a career officer in the National Security Agency. In the 1970s Lowman worked on the declassification of World War II Japanese cable traffic decrypted by the Magic program. Based on his reading of those cables, he criticized the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians for its conclusion that there had been &quot;no military necessity&quot; in relocating Japanese-Americans into internment camps. In 1985, in a court case brought by Gordon Hirabayashi to clear his wartime conviction for refusing to report for relocation, Lowman testified that the United States government had intercepted and decrypted signal traffic from Japan directing officials in the United States to organize spy networks using Japanese-Americans as agents. The court decided in favor of Hirabayashi. Lowman died in April 1999.

== Posthumous book ==

Lowman&#x27;s book &quot;MAGIC: The Untold Story of U.S. Intelligence and the Evacuation of Japanese Residents from the West Coast during World War II&quot; was published posthumously in 2001. &quot;Magic&quot; argued that the internment of Japanese Americans was justified based on intercepted communications that indicated a spy network operating on the American West Coast.
The book was published by Lee Allen, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and activist who convinced the Smithsonian Institution to revise downward its estimates of medals and honors awarded to Japanese-American soldiers in World War II. Allen also wrote the book&#x27;s foreword, in which he claimed that for Japanese-Americans during World War II, &quot;evacuation and life under government care provided much needed relief from trials and threats they faced on the West Coast&quot;. &quot;Magic&quot; particularly criticized the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which offered reparations to surviving Japanese-American internees.

Writing for &quot;Military Review&quot;, Richard Milligan concluded that &quot;Magic&quot; &quot;refutes the accepted history that the evacuation was solely the result of national leaders&#x27; &#x27;racism, war hysteria and the lack of political will&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; agreed that the book&#x27;s discussion of decrypted Japanese communications &quot;makes a solid case that the intelligence community&#x27;s faith in its credibility contributed significantly to the government&#x27;s decision&quot; but also noted that book did not actually refute the claims of racism, digressing instead into technical details and &quot;bitter critique of the 1988 decision to compensate the former prisoners&quot;. Jonathan Kirsch of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the book for being &quot;intellectually honest enough to allow us to come to our own conclusions&quot;, particularly in its inclusion of a rebuttal from the general counsel for the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, but also suggested that &quot;it is possible to read the MAGIC intercepts and come away with an entirely different impression of the evidence&quot;.

<text>The Scaled Composites Model 311 Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer (registered N277SF) is an aircraft designed by Burt Rutan in which Steve Fossett first flew a solo nonstop airplane flight around the world in slightly more than 67 hours (2 days 19 hours) in 2005. The flight speed of set the world record for the fastest nonstop non-refueled circumnavigation, beating the mark set by the previous Rutan-designed Voyager aircraft at 9 days 3 minutes with an average speed of .

The aircraft was owned by the pilot Steve Fossett, sponsored by Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Atlantic airline, and built by Burt Rutan&#x27;s company, Scaled Composites. The two companies subsequently worked together on Virgin Galactic.

In February 2006, Fossett flew the GlobalFlyer for the longest aircraft flight distance in history: .

==Design and construction==
The GlobalFlyer was specifically designed to make an uninterrupted (non-refueled) circumnavigation of the globe with a single pilot. Unusual for a modern civil aircraft, the GlobalFlyer has only a single jet engine.

The GlobalFlyer has twin tail booms mounted outboard of a shorter central fuselage nacelle. The pressurized cockpit is located in the front of the fuselage and provides of space in which the pilot sits. The single turbofan engine is mounted in an unusual position above the fuselage at a point several feet behind the cockpit, a similar arrangement to that on the Heinkel He 162 and Cirrus Vision SF50. The outboard booms contain large fuel tanks and end in tail surfaces, which are not cross-connected.

The aircraft is constructed of carbon fiber reinforced plastic, the main structural member being a high-aspect-ratio single-spar wing of span. The wings are made of high-strength composite materials with the skin of the aircraft being a graphite/epoxy and Aramid honeycomb. The use of lightweight materials permits the fuel (in 13 tanks) to compose 83% of the take-off weight.

The aircraft had an estimated lift-to-drag ratio of 37. The aerodynamic drag is so low that, even with the engine idling, the aircraft can only descend at a maximum of . Twin drogue parachutes were used to slow the GlobalFlyer to landing speeds.

The earlier Voyager aircraft structure had been by necessity built so lightly that it significantly deflected under aerodynamic loading. Learning from this experience, Rutan designed the GlobalFlyer to have greater stiffness. A design using a single jet engine was chosen for the GlobalFlyer for increased reliability over piston engines and faster circumnavigation for the solo pilot.

The GlobalFlyer is designed to operate at high altitudes, where the air is colder, yet in-tank fuel heaters were not included in its design. There was some concern that the fuel might freeze if the aircraft used standard jet fuel. Therefore, the GlobalFlyer&#x27;s Williams International FJ44-3 ATW turbofan (which normally takes Jet-A fuel), was re-calibrated to burn JP-4, which has a substantially lower freezing point.

==First solo nonstop circumnavigation==
In January 2005, following solo test flights at Mojave, California, by Chief Engineer Jon Karkow and pilot Steve Fossett, Fossett moved the GlobalFlyer to the Salina Municipal Airport in Salina, Kansas, where a recently resurfaced runway of would accommodate the anticipated long takeoff roll. The circumnavigation attempt was delayed until 28 February 2005 to obtain a weather forecast with low turbulence for the fragile GlobalFlyer and good tailwinds.

Mission Control was at the Salina campus of Kansas State University, located adjacent to the Salina Municipal Airport.

A tailwind was essential to making the that it needed to fly to meet the FAI’s definition of circumnavigation, the length of the Tropic of Cancer. The GlobalFlyer was designed to complete the circumnavigation with minimal reserves of fuel. As it turned out, a design flaw in the fuel venting system resulted in the loss of about of fuel early in the flight. This forced Fossett and Mission Control to consider terminating the flight as it reached the Pacific Ocean near Japan. Fossett chose to delay the final decision until he reached Hawaii. By that time, favorable winds encouraged the mission team to attempt to complete the circumnavigation.

GlobalFlyer landed at Salina at 19:50 UTC (13:50 CST) on 3 March 2005, having completed its circumnavigation in 2 days, 19 hours, 1 minute and 46 seconds. , this is the fastest world trip in its class at a speed of . The distance flown was determined to be , only above the minimum distance required.

==Longest distance aircraft flight (2006)==
Fossett planned a second circumnavigation in the GlobalFlyer in 2006, this time taking off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, flying eastbound around the world then crossing the Atlantic a second time and then landing at Manston Airport in Kent, England.

The objective was to break the Absolute Distance Without Landing Record for airplanes and to exceed the longest distance by any kind of aircraft which was achieved by the Round the World Balloon flight of Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones in 1999.

On 8 February 2006 at 12:22 UTC, GlobalFlyer took off and flew eastbound from Kennedy Space Center, and landed after 76 hours, 45 minutes with an official distance of .

This distance set a new record for the longest aircraft flight in history, breaking the old records of in an airplane and in a balloon. The landing was made at Bournemouth Airport, England (short of the planned destination at Kent), because of a generator failure at . Generator failure meant that Fossett had about 25 minutes until his batteries were exhausted, when he would have lost all electrical power. To add to the drama, ice on the inside of the canopy made vision difficult, with his landing being made virtually blind; one tire was flat from the takeoff roll and the remaining main tire burst on touchdown due to frozen brakes; and the fuel remaining was indicated to be only .

The aircraft survived the landing, with minor damage including a broken aileron hinge and a jammed intake valve.

==Closed-circuit distance flight and retirement==
Fossett flew the GlobalFlyer to one more major aviation record: the absolute distance over a closed circuit. A closed-circuit record must take off and land at the same place, and the distance is measured over verifiable waypoints. Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager had already flown the Voyager around the world in 1986, so a longer closed circuit course was needed to break their record. Fossett started in Salina, Kansas, on March 14, 2006, and flew eastbound around the world. Upon leaving Japan, he flew south and then tracked along the Equator in order to maximize the distance while crossing the Pacific Ocean. He landed in Salina on March 17 after traversing a total of to set a new absolute distance over a closed circuit record.

With this final record, the GlobalFlyer had set three of the seven absolute world records of airplanes as ratified by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. The GlobalFlyer is now on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.

<doc id="653060" wikidata="Q2914590" url="?curid=653060" title="Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide">
<text>Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) is an organic peroxide with the formula [(CH3)(C2H5)C(O2H)]2O2. MEKP is a colorless oily liquid. It is widely used in vulcanization (crosslinking) of polymers.

It is derived from the reaction of methyl ethyl ketone and hydrogen peroxide under acidic conditions. Several products result from this reaction including a cyclic dimer. The linear dimer, the topic of this article, is the most prevalent. and this is the form that is typically quoted in the commercially available material.

Solutions of 30 to 40% MEKP are used in industry and by hobbyists as catalyst to initiate the crosslinking of unsaturated polyester resins used in fiberglass, and casting. For this application, MEKP often is dissolved in a phlegmatizer such as dimethyl phthalate, cyclohexane peroxide, or to reduce sensitivity to shock. Benzoyl peroxide can be used for the same purpose.

==Safety==
Whereas acetone peroxide is a white powder at STP, MEKP is slightly less sensitive to shock and temperature, and more stable in storage. 

MEKP is a severe skin irritant and can cause progressive corrosive damage or blindness.

The volatile decomposition products of MEKP can contribute to the formation of vapor-phase explosions. Ensuring safe storage is important, and the maximum storage temperature should be limited to below 30 °C.

<doc id="653070" wikidata="Q954446" url="?curid=653070" title="Idaho Steelheads">
<text>The Idaho Steelheads are an American professional minor league ice hockey team based in Boise, Idaho, and a member of the ECHL. The Steelheads play in the Mountain Division of the ECHL&#x27;s Western Conference since the 2016–17 season.

In 1996, the Steelheads were announced as a 1997–98 expansion team by Diamond Sports Management, headed by Cord Pereira, as a member of the West Coast Hockey League (WCHL). The Steelheads and the rest of the WCHL joined the ECHL in 2003. As of the 2022-23 season, the Steelheads are the westernmost ECHL team. During the 2003–04 season and since the 2005–06 season the Steelheads have been an affiliate of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Dallas Stars. The Austin-based Texas Stars have been the Dallas Stars AHL affiliate since the 2009–10 season. Home games are played at the 5,002-seat Idaho Central Arena in downtown Boise.

The Steelheads are named for a species of seagoing rainbow trout native to Idaho streams and rivers and popular with local anglers. Despite this, the original primary and alternate logos consisted of a puck bouncing off a hockey mask and the state of Idaho respectively. When the team underwent a rebrand in the 2006–07 season, a trout was included in Idaho&#x27;s alternate. After the departure of the Victoria Salmon Kings in 2011, the Steelheads made the trout logo their new primary one.

==History==
===WCHL=== 
====1997–2003====
The Steelheads began play as part of a four-team expansion in the West Coast Hockey League in 1997, along with the Tacoma Sabercats, Phoenix Mustangs and Tucson Gila Monsters, which have all since ceased operations. Former New York Islanders defenseman Dave Langevin became Idaho&#x27;s first head coach. During its inaugural season, in addition to its WCHL schedule the Steelheads played two exhibition games in Boise against the Russian Super League team CKA-Amur (now Amur Khabarovsk). The Steelheads finished third in the WCHL North Division in 1997–98, but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Anchorage Aces (later known as the Alaska Aces).

Langevin left the team in 1998 and was replaced as head coach by former NHL goaltender Clint Malarchuk. Under Malarchuk the Steelheads were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in 1998–99 and 1999–00.

In 2000, Malarchuk was succeeded as head coach by John Olver, who had coached the Tacoma Sabercats to the WCHL championship in 1998–99. The Steelheads reached the WCHL finals in 2000–01 and 2001–02, but were defeated by the San Diego Gulls and Fresno Falcons, respectively.

Although the Steelheads finished with the best record in the WCHL&#x27;s final season in 2002–03, the Falcons eliminated them in the first round of the playoffs.

===ECHL===
The Idaho Steelheads have been a member of the ECHL since 2003, winning the league&#x27;s Kelly Cup championship in 2004 and 2007. They are one of only five active ECHL teams to win multiple league championships, alongside the South Carolina Stingrays with three championships, and the Allen Americans, Florida Everblades and Toledo Walleye (which was then known as the Storm prior to suspending operations in 2007 to build their new arena) with two each. The defunct Alaska Aces and Hampton Roads Admirals also won three ECHL championships each.

====2003–2010====
In 2003, the WCHL was absorbed by the ECHL and folded. The Steelheads, along with several other WCHL-affiliated teams – namely the Alaska Aces, Bakersfield Condors, Fresno Falcons, Las Vegas Wranglers, Long Beach Ice Dogs and San Diego Gulls – became ECHL members beginning with the 2003–04 season. Idaho won the 2004 Kelly Cup in its first season in the ECHL, defeating the Florida Everblades in the Kelly Cup finals. The Steelheads were the first team to win the ECHL championship in its first year in the league since the Greensboro Monarchs won the title in the league&#x27;s second season of operation (1989–90).

In 2004–05 the Steelheads were eliminated in the first round of the ECHL playoffs by the Long Beach Ice Dogs. Olver was succeeded as head coach by Derek Laxdal after the season. In 2005–06 Laxdal guided the team back to the playoffs, but they were eliminated in the second round by the Las Vegas Wranglers.

The Steelheads hosted the 2007 ECHL All-Star Game in Boise. Later that year the Steelheads won their second Kelly Cup by defeating the Stockton Thunder, Las Vegas Wranglers and Alaska Aces in the playoffs, and ultimately the Dayton Bombers in the league finals.

In the 2007–08 playoffs, Idaho was swept in the first round by eventual champions the Alaska Aces, and in the 2008–09 playoffs lost to Victoria Salmon Kings in the first round.

In 2009–10, the Steelheads clinched their first Brabham Cup (ECHL regular season title) with one week remaining in the season. They received a bye in the first round of the 2010 Kelly Cup Playoffs before sweeping the Utah Grizzlies in the conference semifinals and beating the Stockton Thunder in six games to win the National Conference championship to advance to their third Kelly Cup finals since joining the league in 2003. They met the Cincinnati Cyclones in the finals, but lost the series 4–1, with each game being decided by one goal.

====2010–present====
Laxdal left the team after the 2009–10 season to accept the head coaching position with the major junior Edmonton Oil Kings. Although his replacement, Hardy Sauter, led the Steelheads to a playoff series victory against Las Vegas in 2010–11, he was let go after the 2011–12 season after the Steelheads failed to crack the 75-point plateau for the first time since the team&#x27;s WCHL tenure. In June 2012, the Steelheads named SPHL Augusta RiverHawks head coach Brad Ralph as Sauter&#x27;s replacement.

In Ralph&#x27;s first season in Idaho the Steelheads advanced to the Western Conference finals, but were defeated by the Stockton Thunder in five games. In the first round of the 2013–14 playoffs, the Steelheads defeated the Colorado Eagles in six games, culminating in a quadruple overtime victory which set a record as the longest game in ECHL history. They were eliminated in the second round by the eventual champion Alaska Aces.

In 2014–15 the Steelheads won the regular season Pacific Division title with their first 100-point season since 2009–10, but were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the Utah Grizzlies. Ralph left the Steelheads in August 2015 to take the head coaching position with the WHL Kelowna Rockets. Assistant coach and former player Neil Graham was promoted to the head coaching position several days later.

Idaho finished the 2015–16 season in second place in the West Division, although tied in points with the first place Colorado Eagles due to them having more wins. They were seeded fifth in the Western Conference for the 2016 Kelly Cup playoffs and were defeated in the conference quarterfinals by the defending champion Allen Americans, 4-games-to-3. Jefferson Dahl and Emil Molin would tie for the team lead in goals during the regular season with 22 goals. Rob Linsmayer led the team with 57 points. Philippe Desrosiers appeared in a team high 31 games in goal for the Steelheads with a 15–7–6 record with a 2.34 GAA and 2 shutouts. Idaho would finish 15th overall in attendance with an average of 4198 fans per game.

As of the end of the 2018–19 season, the Steelheads have never missed the playoffs in either the WCHL or the ECHL. When the Detroit Red Wings became eliminated from the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Steelheads then had the longest active playoff streak in professional hockey at twenty seasons in 2016–17. This streak ended when the Steelheads failed to make the playoffs at the end of the 2021-22 season.

In early 2019, it was confirmed that the Steelheads had been approached by the upcoming Seattle Kraken with an interest in the Steelheads becoming their American Hockey League affiliate, although the Kraken later filed for an AHL expansion team in Palm Springs, California, which came to be the Coachella Valley Firebirds.

In July 2019, head coach Neil Graham was hired as an assistant coach of the AHL affiliate Texas Stars and was replaced by Steelheads&#x27; assistant Everett Sheen. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelheads voluntarily suspended operations for the 2020–21 ECHL season.

==Rivalries==
The Steelheads&#x27; most notable rival are the Utah Grizzlies due to proximity.

The team&#x27;s former rivals include the refugees of the old WCHL: the Alaska Aces, Fresno Falcons, and Bakersfield Condors. In their original markets, their common history stretched back nearly twenty years. Fresno then folded in 2008, Bakersfield relocated to become the new Norfolk Admirals in 2015, and the Alaska franchise folded in 2017 before it was sold to become the Maine Mariners.

Until their 2014 suspension of operations, the Steelheads also had a rivalry with the Las Vegas Wranglers due to their frequent playoff meetings.

==Media==
All Steelheads games are broadcast on AM 1350 KTIK in Boise and have been since the 1997 inception of the franchise. KTIK and the Steelheads were under the same ownership until Citadel Broadcasting&#x27;s 2002 purchase of the station. SparkLight cable carries live video on channel 72. Collin Schuck is the voice of the Steelheads for all home and away games since joining the organization in 2018.

In 2021 streaming video coverage was added with the ECHL partnership with FloSports. Collin Schuck&#x27;s radio play by play is blended with in house CCTV video during away games, and additional production features (such as stream only instant replay on separate feed from CCTV) for home games.

<doc id="653071" wikidata="Q1094483" url="?curid=653071" title="Civil Rights Act of 1968">
<text>The Civil Rights Act of 1968 () is a landmark law in the United States signed into law by United States President Lyndon B. Johnson during the King assassination riots.

Titles II through VII comprise the Indian Civil Rights Act, which applies to the Native American tribes of the United States and makes many but not all of the guarantees of the U.S. Bill of Rights applicable within the tribes. (That Act appears today in Title 25, sections 1301 to 1303 of the United States Code).

Titles VIII and IX are commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, which was meant as a follow-up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (This is different legislation than the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, which expanded housing funding programs.) While the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibited discrimination in housing, there were no federal enforcement provisions. The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and since 1974, sex. Since 1988, the act protects people with disabilities and families with children. Pregnant women are also protected from illegal discrimination because they have been given familial status with their unborn child being the other family member. Victims of discrimination may use both the 1968 act and the 1866 act&#x27;s section 1983 to seek redress. The 1968 act provides for federal solutions while the 1866 act provides for private solutions (i.e., civil suits). The act also made it a federal crime to &quot;by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone... by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin, handicap or familial status.&quot;

Title X, commonly known as the Anti-Riot Act, makes it a felony to &quot;travel in interstate commerce...with the intent to incite, promote, encourage, participate in and carry on a riot.&quot; That provision has been criticized for &quot;equating organized political protest with organized violence.&quot;

==Background==

The first shift towards equality for African Americans occurred when President Abraham Lincoln passed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which declared that &quot;all persons held as slaves... shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free...&quot;. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 declared all people born in the United States are legally citizens. That means they could rent, hold, sell and buy property. It was meant to help former slaves, and those who refused to grant the new rights to ex-slaves were guilty and punishable under law. The penalty was a fine of $1000 or a maximum of one year in jail. The 1866 act provided no means to enforce the provisions.

The Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968), beginning after the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education case,&quot; paved the way for the passage of a few civil rights bills. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 created the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Act of 1960 enacted federal legislation of local registration polls and if anyone obstructed someone&#x27;s right to vote, there were severe penalties. It also extended the Civil Rights Commission, so it could oversee registration and voting practices. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Unequal application of voter registration requirements, racial segregation, and employment discrimination were also prohibited. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, similar to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibited racial discrimination in voting. The Act was later expanded to help protect the right to vote for racial minorities throughout the country (mainly the South).

Another impetus for the law&#x27;s passage came from the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement, led by Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and Al Raby. Also influential was the 1963 Rumford Fair Housing Act in California, which had been backed by the NAACP and CORE. and the 1967 Milwaukee fair housing campaigns led by James Groppi and the NAACP Youth Council. Senator Walter Mondale advocated for the bill in Congress, but noted that over successive years, a federal fair housing bill was the most filibustered legislation in US history. It was opposed by most Northern and Southern senators, as well as the National Association of Real Estate Boards. A proposed &quot;Civil Rights Act of 1966&quot; collapsed completely because of its fair housing provision. Mondale commented:

A lot of [previous] civil rights [legislation] was about making the South behave and taking the teeth from George Wallace…. This came right to the neighborhoods across the country. This was civil rights getting personal.

Two developments revived the bill. The Kerner Commission report on the 1967 race riots strongly recommended &quot;a comprehensive and enforceable federal open housing law,&quot; and was cited regularly by Congress members arguing for the legislation. The final breakthrough came in the aftermath of the April 4, 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the civil unrest across the country following King&#x27;s death. On April 5, Johnson wrote a letter to the United States House of Representatives urging passage of the Fair Housing Act. The Rules Committee, &quot;jolted by the repeated civil disturbances virtually outside its door,&quot; finally ended its hearings on April 8. With newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic Speaker of the House John McCormack, the bill (which was previously stalled) passed the House by a wide margin on April 10.

==Legislative history==

In 1966, President Johnson proposed a new civil rights bill, but it was not passed through by the Senate. On February 17, 1967, the bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Manny Celler and in the Senate by Senator Philip A. Hart.

The House Judiciary Committee cleared HR 2516 (civil rights bill) and HR 10805 (extended life of Civil Rights Commission for another five years). House Judiciary Subcommittee No. 5 June 22 approved a package combining HR 2516 and HR 421 (Administration bill) in order to strengthen protections for civil rights workers.

The initial vote in the House of Representatives was 327–92 (161–25 in the House Republican Conference and 166–67 in the House Democratic Caucus) with 12 members voting present or abstaining, while in the Senate the final vote with amendments was 71–20 (29–3 in the Senate Republican Conference and 42–17 in the Senate Democratic Caucus) with 5 members voting present or abstaining. The House agreed to the Senate amendments by a vote of 250–172 (100–84 in the House Republican Conference and 150–88 in the House Democratic Caucus) with 10 members voting present or abstaining.

Bill H.R. 2516 was passed by the 90th United States Congress and signed by the 36th President of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson on April 11, 1968.

==Parts==
===Title I: Hate crimes===
The Civil Rights Act of 1968 also enacted (b)(2), which permits federal prosecution of anyone who &quot;willingly injures, intimidates or interferes with another person, or attempts to do so, by force because of the other person&#x27;s race, color, religion or national origin&quot; because of the victim&#x27;s attempt to engage in one of six types of federally protected activities, such as attending school, patronizing a public place/facility, applying for employment, acting as a juror in a state court or voting.

Persons violating this law face a fine or imprisonment of up to one year or both. If bodily injury results or if such acts of intimidation involve the use of firearms, explosives or fire, individuals can receive prison terms of up to 10 years, while crimes involving kidnapping, sexual assault, or murder can be punishable by life in prison or the death penalty.

Though sexual orientation and gender identity were also excluded from this law, they are included in a more recent Federal hate-crime law, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

===Title II–VII: Indian Civil Rights Act===
The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 granted Native Americans full access to the United States Bill of Rights. The first minor section focuses on re-establishing amendments now granted to Native Americans. The main portion of the section focuses on Native Americans in the United States legal system. The last section of this act points out other materials related to more constitutional rights of Native Americans, such as the &quot;Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties&quot; doctrine.

===Title VIII–IX: Fair Housing Act===
====Housing discrimination====
Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 is commonly referred to as the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Since 1968 its protections have been expanded significantly by amendment. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is charged with administering and enforcing this law.

====Types of banned discrimination====

The Civil Rights Act of 1968 prohibited the following forms of housing discrimination:

* Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of their race, color, religion or national origin. Discrimination on the basis of sex was added in 1974, and people with disabilities and families with children were added to the list of protected classes in 1988.
* Discrimination against a person in the terms, conditions or privilege of the sale or rental of a dwelling.
* Advertising the sale or rental of a dwelling indicating preference of discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin. This provision was also amended to include sex, disability, and having children.
* Coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with a person&#x27;s enjoyment or exercise of housing rights based on discriminatory reasons or retaliating against a person or organization that aids or encourages the exercise or enjoyment of fair housing rights.
* Neglecting maintenance and repairs of the units rented by people based on race, religion, sex, or any other discriminatory demographic.
* Restricting access to services and amenities on the basis of the renter&#x27;s race, gender, religion, or nationality.
* In 2012, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a regulation prohibiting LGBT discrimination in federally assisted housing programs. The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that discrimination on the basis of &quot;sex&quot; includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It was not until February 2021 that Housing and Urban Development issued a rule change under President Joe Biden to implement this decision. In addition, many states, cities and towns have passed laws prohibiting discrimination in housing based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

====Types of allowed discrimination====
Only certain kinds of discrimination are covered by fair housing laws. Landlords are not required by law to rent to any tenant who applies for a property. Landlords can select tenants based on objective business criteria, such as the applicant&#x27;s ability to pay the rent and take care of the property. Landlords can lawfully discriminate against tenants with bad credit histories or low incomes, and (except in some areas) do not have to rent to tenants who will be receiving Section 8 vouchers. Landlords must be consistent in the screening, treat tenants who are inside and outside the protected classes in the same manner, and should document any legitimate business reason for not renting to a prospective tenant.

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has stated that buyers and renters may discriminate and may request real estate agents representing them to limit home searches to parameters that are discriminatory. The primary purpose of the Fair Housing Act is to protect the buyer&#x27;s (and renter&#x27;s) right to seek a dwelling anywhere they choose. It protects the buyer&#x27;s right to discriminate by prohibiting certain discriminatory acts by sellers, landlords, and real estate agents.

==== People with disabilities ====
The Fair Housing Act defines a person with a disability in the same manner as the Americans with Disabilities Act – “a person with a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment.” 

The Fair Housing Act provides several specific protections for buyers and tenants with disabilities. Landlords and sellers cannot make a dwelling unit unavailable or deny a dwelling to a buyer or renter because of their disability or the disability of any person who intends to reside in the dwelling or because of the disability of anyone with whom they are associated. Landlords cannot deny a person with a disability all of the privileges provided in connection with the dwelling, because of the person&#x27;s disability.

The Fair Housing Act (FHA) provides some specific protections for people with disabilities that facilitate independence and community living. First, the FHA allows tenants to make reasonable modifications to the existing premises. It makes it illegal for landlords to not allow people with disabilities to make reasonable modifications to the premises, at their own expense, if they need the modification to have full enjoyment of the premises. For example, an individual with a disability may require grab bars installed in order to have access to take a shower. The landlord must allow the tenant to install the grab bars to allow access to take a shower. However, technically, the landlord may require the tenant remove the grab bars at the end of the tenancy, at the tenant&#x27;s own expense. However, the regulations specify that in rental housing, a landlord may not condition widening a bathroom doorway to provide wheelchair access, to its return to its former narrow state upon the end of the tenancy, since it will not interfere with the next tenants use and enjoyment of the premises.

The second protection offered by the FHA includes the requirement that no one can refuse to make reasonable accommodations to “rules, policies, practices, or services, when the accommodation is necessary to afford” a person with a disability “equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit,” including the amenities of the dwelling, which may involve common areas. For example, a building with a “No Pets” policy would violate the FHA if it did not allow a blind person to have their seeing eye dog live with them as a reasonable accommodation to the policy. Similarly, a wheelchair user could request an assigned, accessible parking space as a reasonable accommodation in a “first come first serve” parking lot attached to an apartment complex.

===Title X: Anti-Riot Act===
The Act included the &quot;Anti-Riot Act,&quot; enacted at (with its key terms, &quot;riot&quot; and &quot;incite a riot,&quot; defined in ), which makes it a federal crime to use interstate or foreign commerce routes or facilities (such as by crossing state lines or through mail, use of the Internet, or phone calls) to incite a riot, organize, promote or participate in a riot or to extend activities of a riot, or to aid and abet any person performing such activities. The provision has been informally referred to as the &quot;H. Rap Brown Law&quot; since the arrest and trial of H. Rap Brown in 1967 for carrying a gun across state lines. Rulings by the 4th Circuit in 2020 and 9th Circuit in 2021 struck down in those circuits the portions of the law which prohibit &quot;urging&quot; a riot on the grounds of freedom of speech, leaving in place bans on inciting and participation in riots.

==Titles==
Note: Most of the information provided in this Section was paraphrased from the Titles. If you are interested at looking through the original titles, feel free to look at the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

===Title I—interference with federally protected activities===
Section 101 holds that Chapter 13, civil rights, title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting a new section (Section 245) called Federally protected activities. It establishes that this section isn&#x27;t set as an intent on the part of Congress, or is constructed to limited the authority of Federal officers (or Federal grand jury) to investigate possible violations in this section. In this section of the bill sets the standard for preventing any kind of threat of force by someone who willfully injures, intimidates, interferes with or even attempts any of these actions upon a person of color (full discrimination set as race, color, religion, or national origin) when the minority in question is:

* Voting or qualifying to vote, qualifying or campaigning as a candidate for elective office, or qualifying or acting as a poll watcher, or any legally authorized election official in any election
* Participating in or enjoying any benefit, service, privilege, program, facility
* Applying for or enjoying employment
* Serving, or attending upon any court in connection with possible service, as a grand or petit juror in any court
* Participating in or enjoying the benefits of any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance
* Enrolling in or attending any public school or public college
* Traveling in or using airy facility of interstate commerce, or using any vehicle, terminal, or facility of any common carrier by motor, rail, water, or air
* Enjoying the. goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any inn, hotel, motel, or other establishment

Any citizen who has been ordered to discourage these citizens from aiding/encouraging other persons to participate without discrimination in any activities listed above will be:

* Fined $1,000 or imprisoned for a year (or both)
* Fined $10,000 or imprisoned for ten years (or both) if there was any sort of bodily injury
* Imprisoned for any term of years or for life if death has occurred

There is a similar section that also involved prevention for intimidation in fair housing, in Title XII.

The rest of the sections in this title are based around amendments to this legislative Act. For example, besides Section 245, Section 2101 called Riots has also been added. In this section, it focuses on putting a penalty behind any related riot actions, where a person can be fined $10,000 or imprisoned for 5 years (or both). There is a definition section (Section 2102) for defining: riot and to incite a riot. Also, This section also holds an edit for the United States Code, where a chapter called Riots is inserted.

===Title II—rights of Indians===
The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 applies to the Indian tribes of the United States and makes many but not all of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights applicable within the federally recognized tribes. The Act appears today in Title 25, sections 1301 to 1303 of the United States Code.

==== Events before passage====
The US Supreme Court had made clear that tribal internal affairs concerning tribal members&#x27; individual rights were not covered by the Fifth Amendment to the US constitution. However, the tribes were ultimately subjected to the power of Congress and the Constitution. The court case &quot;Talton v. Mayes&quot; helped establish the principles. There were other court cases over the following years to continue the thoughts &quot;that tribes were not arms of the federal government when punishing tribal members for criminal acts and that Indian tribes were exempt from many of the constitutional protections governing the actions of state and federal governments.&quot;

In the 1960s, Congress held a series of hearings on the subject of the authority of tribal governments. The hearings told about the abuses that many tribal members had endured from the &quot;sometimes corrupt, incompetent, or tyrannical tribal officials.&quot; In response, the Indian Civil Rights Act was enacted.

==== Provisions of the Indian Civil Rights Act ====

No Indian tribe in exercising powers of self-government shall—
# make or enforce any law prohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for a redress of grievances;
# violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable search and seizures, nor issue warrants, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the person or thing to be seized;
# subject any person for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy;
# compel any person in any criminal case to be a witness against himself;
# take any private property for a public use without just compensation;
# deny to any person in a criminal proceeding the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and at his own expense to have the assistance of counsel for his defense;
# require excessive bail, impose excessive fines, inflict cruel and unusual punishments, and in no event impose for conviction of any one offense any penalty or punishment greater than imprisonment for a term of one year and a fine of $5,000, or both;
# deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law;
# pass any bill of attainder or ex post facto law; or
# deny to any person accused of an offense punishable by imprisonment the right, upon request, to a trial by jury of not less than six persons.

According to the US Government Publishing Office, in &quot;imprisonment for a term of one year and a fine of $5,000, or both&quot; in paragraph 7, &quot;and&quot; should probably be &quot;or.&quot;

The act also requires tribal courts to afford due process and other civil liberties. Also, Native American courts try to provide a setting similar to that of a US courtroom, which is familiar to lawyers. That aided the attorneys and helped to divert non-Indian ridicule and established the view that tribal courts were legitimate courts. Tribal courts adopted rules of evidence, pleading, and other requirements similar to those in state and federal courts.

The ICRA incorporated many constitutional protections, but it modified others or did not include them at all: &quot;The law did not impose the establishment clause, the guarantee of a republican form of government, the requirement of a separation of church and state, the right to a jury trial in civil cases, or the right of indigents to appointed counsel in criminal cases.&quot; The provisions were excluded because the government recognized the different political and cultural status of the tribes.

Even though the federal government respected their individuality in this respect, the establishment of the ICRA caused the tribal governments to &quot;mirror&quot; modern American courts and procedures.

The impact of ICRA was greatly limited by the Supreme Court by the &quot;Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez&quot; court case (1978). &quot;Martinez&quot; involved a request to stop denying tribal membership to those children born to female (not male) tribal members who married outside of the tribe. The mother who brought the case pleaded that the discrimination against her child was solely based on sex, which violated the ICRA. The courts decided that &quot;tribal common-law sovereign immunity prevented a suit against the tribe.&quot; &quot;Martinez&quot; ultimately strengthened tribal self-determination by further proving that generally, the federal government played no enforcement role over the tribal governments.

===Title III—model code governing courts of Indian offenses===
The Secretary of Interior is supposed to recommend (to Congress) a model code to govern the administration of justice when it comes to Indian offenses on Indian reservations on July 1, 1968. The title also mentions some provisions for individuals being tried in the court of Indian offenses:

* Any individual being tried shall have the same rights, privileges, and immunities as any other individual granted by the United States Constitution.
* Any individual being tried will be advised and made aware of these rights and any other tribal constitution applicable.
* Establish proper qualifications for the office of judge
* Provide training for judges through educational classes

In order to carry out these provisions, the Secretary of Interior was also encouraged to consult with Indians, Indian tribes, and agencies of the U.S.

===Title IV—jurisdiction over criminal and civil actions===
Section 401 covers assumptions by states. It&#x27;s the main foundation for Indian rights. It states that Indians shall not be alienated or deprived of any right, privilege, or immunity afforded under Federal treaty, agreement, or statute with respect to hunting, trapping, or fishing or the control, licensing, or regulation.

Section 402 covers assumptions by states of civil jurisdiction. The main point to focus on here is to note how the States don&#x27;t have jurisdiction over civil causes of action between Indians or Indian parties. However, this section also brings up more Indian rights. It states that nothing shall authorize the alienation, encumbrance, or taxation of any real or personal property, including water rights, belonging to any Indian or any Indian tribe, band, or community.

Section 403 covers retrocession of jurisdiction by states. The United States is authorized to accept a retrocession by any state of all or any measure of the criminal or civil jurisdiction (or both).

Section 404 covers consent to amend state laws. The United States is given to the people of any state to amend their state constitution or existing statutes, in order to remove any legal impediment to the assumption of civil or criminal jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of this title.

Section 405 covers actions not to abate. It states that no action pending immediately prior to any cession of jurisdiction shall abate by reason of that section. For the action or proceeding, such cession shall take place on the day after the date of the final determination of the action or proceeding. Also, it states that no cession made by the United States shall deprive any court to hear, determine, render judgment, or impose sentence in any criminal action instituted against any person for any offense committed.

Section 406 covers special elections. State jurisdiction is created by a majority vote of adult Indians in a special election. For this special election, the Secretary of the Interior calls the rules and regulations for the election, when the tribal council or other governing body requests to do so.

===Title V—offenses within Indian country===
Amends section 1153 of title 18 of the United States Code. With the new addition, it reads: &quot;weapon assault resulting in serious bodily injury&quot;.

===Title VI—employment of legal counsel===
An Indian, Indian tribe, Indian council, or any group of Indians have a right for the employment of legal counsel, and includes the choice of counsel and the fixing of fees. If any application made requiring the approval of the Secretary of Interior or the Commissioner of Indian Affairs is not granted or denied within 90 days, then the approval shall be deemed to have been granted.

===Title VII—materials relating to constitutional rights of Indians===
In this title, there are two materials mentioned to help strengthen the constitutional rights of Native Americans: &quot;Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties&quot; and &quot;Federal Indian Law&quot;. This Act only mentions for these documents to be revised and printed on September 1, 1967. However, it is crucial to truly understand what these materials contain.

The &quot;Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties&quot; material is full of treaties between Natives and the U.S. government. For this bill, however, the protection was originally created by the Treaty of Peace between the Navajo Indian Tribe and the United States. On June 1, 1868, with the signing by 29 Navajo headmen and 10 officers of the United States Army, the sovereignty of the Navajo Tribe was officially recognized. (It was later ratified by the Senate on July 23 and proclaimed by President Andrew Johnson on August 12). With this treaty, it brought the end to a four-year period of the hardships and exile brought upon the Navajo Tribe.

On May 17, 1968, Congress, with a joint resolution, requested the President for a centennial signing of the treaty. Therefore, President Lyndon B. Johnson established the centennial of the signing of the 1868 Treaty of Peace between the Navajo Indian Tribe and the United States.

The &quot;Federal Indian Law&quot; material, on the other hand, is much broader than the other source. Basically, &quot;Federal Indian Law&quot; contains treaties, statutes, executive orders, administrative decisions and court cases that defines the political and legal status of federally recognized Native Americans. Within this material, the relationship of tribes and the U.S. government is defined as well as what the role of tribes are in states and the federal government. The three fundamental legal principles* in &quot;Federal Indian Law&quot; are:

# American Indian and Alaska Native tribes that are recognized by the federal government are independent sovereign governments, separate from the states and from the federal government.
# Unless Congress provides otherwise, the sovereignty of federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes generally extends over their federally recognized geographic territory (e.g., reservations, allotments, trust and restricted Indian lands, and other Indian country), including over the activities and conduct of tribal members and non-tribal members within that territory
# The sovereignty of federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes is inherent and exists unless and until Congress takes it away.

*Note: The legal principles are sourced from the &quot;Federal Indian Law&quot; material, resourced from the &quot;Federal Indian Law and Policy Affecting American Indian and Alaska Native Education&quot; document

===Title VIII—fair housing===
The 1968 Fair Housing Act is a federal act in the United States intended to protect the buyer or renter of a dwelling from seller or landlord discrimination. Its primary prohibition makes it unlawful to refuse to sell, rent to, or negotiate with any person because of that person&#x27;s inclusion in a protected class. The goal is a unitary housing market in which a person&#x27;s background (as opposed to financial resources) does not arbitrarily restrict access. Calls for open housing were issued early in the twentieth century, but it was not until after World War II that concerted efforts to achieve it were undertaken.

The legislation was the culmination of a civil rights campaign against housing discrimination in the United States, including the 1966 Chicago open housing movement, and was approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson one week after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.

The Fair Housing Act was enacted as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and codified at 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619, with penalties for violation at 42 U.S.C. 3631. It is enforced by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

====Summary====
The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) introduced meaningful federal enforcement mechanisms. It outlaws:

* Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.
* Discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin in the terms, conditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling.
* Advertising the sale or rental of a dwelling indicating preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, disability or national origin.
* Coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with a person&#x27;s enjoyment or exercise of housing rights based on discriminatory reasons or retaliating against a person or organization that aids or encourages the exercise or enjoyment of fair housing rights.

A guide to legal and illegal acts in selling one&#x27;s home under the Act is available here:

When the Fair Housing Act was first enacted, it prohibited discrimination only on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin. Sex was added as a protected characteristic in 1974. In 1988, disability and familial status (the presence or anticipated presence of children under 18 in a household) were added (further codified in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990). In certain circumstances, the law allows limited exceptions for discrimination based on sex, religion, or familial status.

In 2017, a federal judge ruled that sexual orientation and gender identity are protected classes under the Fair Housing Act. As of May 2018, there is an additional pending effort to amend the Fair Housing Act to make this explicit (HR 1447). In a meeting on May 16, 2018, with the National Association of Realtors (NAR), Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who was campaigning for his 16th term, said he believed that homeowners should be allowed to refuse to sell their home to gay and lesbian homebuyers. The NAR disagreed and withdrew its endorsement of the Congressman over the matter.

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is the federal executive department with the statutory authority to administer and enforce the &quot;Fair Housing Act&quot;. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has delegated fair housing enforcement and compliance activities to HUD&#x27;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) and HUD&#x27;s Office of General Counsel. FHEO is one of the United States&#x27; largest federal civil rights agencies. It has a staff of more than 600 people located in 54 offices around the United States. As of August 2017, the head of FHEO is Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Anna Maria Farias, whose appointment was confirmed on August 3, 2017.

Individuals who believe they have experienced housing discrimination can file a complaint with FHEO at no charge. FHEO funds and has working agreements with many state and local governmental agencies where &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; fair housing laws are in place. Under such agreements, FHEO refers complaints to the state or locality where the alleged incident occurred, and those agencies investigate and process the case instead of FHEO. That is known as FHEO&#x27;s Fair Housing Assistance Program (or &quot;FHAP&quot;).

There is also a network of private, non-profit fair housing advocacy organizations throughout the country. Some are funded by FHEO&#x27;s Fair Housing Initiatives Program (or &quot;FHIP&quot;), and some operate with private donations or grants from other sources.

Victims of housing discrimination need not go through HUD or any other governmental agency to pursue their rights, however. The &quot;Fair Housing Act&quot; confers jurisdiction to hear cases on federal district courts. The United States Department of Justice also has jurisdiction to file cases on behalf of the United States where there is a pattern and practice of discrimination or where HUD has found discrimination in a case and either party elects to go to federal court instead of continuing in the HUD administrative process.

The Fair Housing Act applies to landlords renting or leasing space in their primary residence only if the residence contains living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more other families living independently of each other, such as an owner-occupied rooming house. Restrictions on discriminatory advertising do apply to all landlords without reservation.

====Enforcement====
The &quot;Fair Housing Act&quot; has been strengthened since its adoption in 1968, but enforcement continues to be a concern among housing advocates. According to a 2010 evaluation of Analysis of Impediments (AI) reports done by the Government Accountability Office, enforcement is particularly inconsistent across local jurisdictions.

===Title IX—prevention of intimidation in fair housing cases===
As the title states, this section of the bill sets the standard for preventing any kind of threat of force by someone who willfully injures, intimidates, interferes with or even attempts any of these actions upon a person of color (full discrimination set as race, color, religion, or national origin) when the minority in question is:

* Selling, purchasing, renting, financing, occupying, contracting, or negotiating for the sale
* Applying for or participating in any service, organization, or facility relating to the business of selling or renting dwellings
* Participating or encouraging others to participate in any of the activities, services, organizations or facilities
* Participating lawfully in speech or peaceful assembly

Any citizen who has been ordered to discourage these citizens from aiding/encouraging other persons to participate without discrimination in any activities listed above will be:

* Fined $1,000 or imprisoned for a year (or both)
* Fined $10,000 or imprisoned for ten years (or both) if there was any sort of bodily injury
* Imprisoned for any term of years or for life if death has occurred

===Title X—civil obedience===
Section 231 covers civil disorders. The civil disorders mentioned in this section are:

* Teaching or demonstrating to any other person the use, application, or making of any firearm or explosive or incendiary device, or technique capable of causing injury or death to people
* Transporting or manufacturing for transportation in commerce any firearm, or explosive or incendiary device, knowing that it will be used in furtherance of a civil disorder

Whoever commits or attempts to commit any of these acts will be fined no more than $10,000 or imprisoned no more than 5 years, or both.

Section 232 covers definitions in this title. The definitions that are defined are: civil disorder, commerce, federally protested function, firearm, explosive or incendiary device, and law enforcement officer.

Section 233 covers preemption. None of the provisions contained in the title are intended on the part of Congress to occupy the state or local laws with the same subject matter nor are constructed to invalidate any provision of state law unless it is inconsistent. This section also holds an edit for the United States Code, where a chapter called Civil Disorders is inserted.

==Amendments==
In 1988, Congress voted to weaken the ability of plaintiffs to prosecute cases of housing discrimination. But the Fair Housing Act was also amended in 1988 to allow plaintiffs&#x27; attorneys to recover attorney&#x27;s fees. Additionally, the 1988 amendment added people with disabilities and families with children to the classes covered by the Act.

==Case law==
In the early 1990s, in &quot;Trouillon v. City of Hawthorne&quot;, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund successfully challenged an urban renewal plan on the basis of race discrimination by bringing suit under the Fair Housing Act. Previous litigation under the Act had largely been limited to discrimination in buying or renting housing.

Although he ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, Judge Davis nevertheless disputed the allegations of discrimination. He said he based his ruling in part on the city&#x27;s failure to prove that the area had a higher crime rate and lower property values than other parts of the city. The city &quot;did not act in bad faith or fraudulently,&quot; Davis wrote. It &quot;did not discriminate against any minority or low or moderate income person and did not violate any person&#x27;s Due Process, Equal Protection or other Civil Rights.&quot;

The Anti-Riot Act of Title I had been rarely used; it notably had been used to prosecute the Chicago Seven, but had not faced strict legal scrutiny. In the late 2010s, with growing concerns over activities of the far right, white nationalists, and white supremacists, the Anti-Riot Act had been used to prosecute organizers of various rallies that had turned violent, such as the Unite the Right rally in 2017. However, in June 2019, a federal district court in California, overseeing the case of members of the Rise Above Movement related to both the Unite the Right rally and other protests in California, ruled that the Anti-Riot Act was unconstitutional in that it was &quot;overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.&quot;

==Legacy==
===U.S. states===
====New York State Human Rights Law====
:Extends the protection to marital status and age, aimed to prevent non-racial discrimination.

====Section 236 and 237 of the New York State Property Law====
:Further extends the protection to include dwellings with children and mobile home parks. That is meant to protect renters and sellers from discriminating based on number of children in a family. Currently the Fair Housing Act protects against discrimination of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. The law applies to all types of housing, rental homes, apartments, condos and houses. The only exception to the act is if an owner of a small rental building lives in the same building he lets. Since he owns the building and also resides there, he can decide who lives there.

===Violations of the Fair Housing Act===
There are an estimated 2 million cases of housing discrimination each year according to HUD. The National Fair Housing Alliance, the largest fair housing non-profit in the country, estimates that number to be closer to 4 million per year, excluding instances of discrimination due to disability or familial status. Housing projects have also come under fire by researchers and NGOs alike. Housing advocates Elizabeth Julian and Michael Daniel state:

in addition to the inequality in the actual housing provided to low-income African-American families under the federal programs, the neighborhoods in which they receive assistance are usually subject to various adverse conditions not found in the neighborhoods surrounding the housing units in which whites receive the same assistance. The conditions include inferior city-provided facilities and services, little or no new or newer residential housing, large numbers of seriously substandard structures, noxious environmental conditions, substandard or completely absent neighborhood service facilities, high crime rates, inadequate access to job centers, and little or no investment of new capital in the area by public and private entities.

<doc id="653074" wikidata="Q1352869" url="?curid=653074" title="Sir William Bowman, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir William Bowman, 1st Baronet (20 July 1816 – 29 March 1892) was an English surgeon, histologist and anatomist. He is best known for his research using microscopes to study various human organs, though during his lifetime he pursued a successful career as an ophthalmologist.

==Life==
Born in Nantwich, Cheshire, third son of a banker and amateur botanist/geologist, Bowman attended Hazelwood School near Birmingham from 1826. A childhood accident involving gunpowder is supposed to have interested him in medicine, and he was apprenticed to surgeon Joseph Hodgson at Birmingham General Hospital in 1832. He left Birmingham in 1837 to further his training as a surgeon and attended King&#x27;s College London, where he served as a prosector under Robert Bentley Todd, a Professor of physiology.

His earliest notable work was on the structure of striated muscle, for which he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1841. At the young age of 25, he identified what then became known as the Bowman&#x27;s capsule, a key component of the nephron. He presented his findings in 1842 in his paper &quot;&quot;On the Structure and Use of the Malpighian Bodies of the Kidney&quot; to the Royal Society and was awarded the Royal Medal. His collaboration with Todd led to the publication of the five-volume &quot;Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Man&quot; (1843–1856) and &quot;Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology&quot;&quot; (1852), which detailed their research on microscopy and histology, relating minute anatomical observations to physiological functions. Their extensive use of the microscopes revolutionized the study of anatomy and physiology. Apart from the Bowman&#x27;s capsule, other anatomical structures named after him include:
* Bowman&#x27;s glands – in the olfactory mucosa
* Bowman&#x27;s layer – the &quot;anterior limiting layer&quot; in the cornea

After completing his surgical training in 1844, Bowman practised as an ophthalmologist at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital (later known as Moorfields Eye Hospital). He was an early user of the ophthalmoscope invented by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1851. Between 1848 and 1855, he also taught at King&#x27;s College. In 1880, he founded the &#x27;Ophthalmological Society&#x27;, which later became the Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

In 1870 he commissioned Arts and Crafts architect Philip Webb to rebuild Joldwynds, Bowman&#x27;s house in Holmbury St Mary, Surrey. It was completed in 1874.

In 1884, Queen Victoria created him as a baronet. He died at Joldwynds on 29 March 1892, and is buried in the neighbouring churchyard of Holmbury St. Mary. A memorial to him lies within St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. 
==Family==
On 28 December 1842, he married Harriet, fifth daughter of Thomas Paget of Leicester, by whom he had seven children. She died at Joldwynds on 25 October 1900. He was succeeded in the title by his eldest son, Sir Paget Bowman.

<text>A rayok (, &quot;small paradise&quot;) was a Russian fairground peep show. Performed using a box with pictures viewed through magnifying lenses, these were accompanied by lewd rhymed jokes. &quot;The Fall of Adam and Eve&quot; was one of the most popular topics. The term rayok has also come to be applied to rhymed humorous talk shows, without peeping, featuring a kind of rhymed prose. The expression &quot;to talk rayok&quot;, говорить райком, thus means to speak in a rhymed, humorous way, to patter. Rayok, in both its peep show and talk show forms, has been an occupation of wandering artists called &quot;rayoshniks&quot;. When used as the title for a piece of music, rayok implies a scurrilous entertainment, as in:

*&quot;Rayok&quot;, an extended song by Modest Mussorgsky also known as &quot;Peep-Show&quot;
*&quot;Anti-formalist Rayok&quot;, a cantata by Dmitri Shostakovich also known as &quot;Little Paradise&quot;, &quot;The Gods&quot; and &quot;A Learner&#x27;s Manual&quot;

<doc id="653089" wikidata="Q3825751" url="?curid=653089" title="Onondaga Lake">
<text>Onondaga Lake is located in Central New York, immediately northwest of and adjacent to Syracuse, New York. The southeastern end of the lake and the southwestern shore abut industrial areas and expressways; the northeastern shore and northwestern end border a series of parks and museums. It is surrounded by Liverpool.
Although it is near the Finger Lakes region, it is not traditionally counted as one of the Finger Lakes. Onondaga Lake is a dimictic lake, meaning that the lake water completely mixes from top to bottom twice a year. The lake is long and wide making a surface area of . The maximum depth of the lake is with an average depth of . Its drainage basin has a surface area of , encompassing Syracuse, Onondaga County except the eastern and northern edges, the southeastern corner of Cayuga County and the Onondaga Nation Territory, and supports approximately 450,000 people.

Onondaga Lake has two natural tributaries that contribute approximately 70% of the total water flow to the lake. These tributaries are Ninemile Creek and Onondaga Creek. The Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (METRO) contributes 20% of the annual flow. No other lake in the United States receives as much of its inflow as treated wastewater. The other tributaries, which include Ley Creek, Seneca River, Harbor Brook, Sawmill Creek, Tributary 5A, and East Flume, contribute the remaining 10% of water flow into the lake. The tributaries flush the lake out about four times a year. Onondaga Lake is flushed much more rapidly than most other lakes. The lake flows to the northwest and discharges into the Seneca River which combines with the Oneida River to form the Oswego River, and ultimately ends up in Lake Ontario.

The lake is sacred to the Onondaga Nation. The Onondaga people had control of the lake taken from them by New York State following the American Revolutionary War. During the late 19th century, European-Americans built many resorts along the lake&#x27;s shoreline, as it was a destination of great beauty. The Onondaga Nation continues to have a religious and cultural presence on the shores of the lake, today.

With the industrialization of the region, much of the lake&#x27;s shoreline was developed; domestic and industrial waste, due to industry and urbanization, led to the severe degradation of the lake. Unsafe levels of pollution led to the banning of ice harvesting as early as 1901. In 1940, swimming was banned, and in 1970 fishing was banned due to mercury contamination. Mercury pollution is still a problem for the lake today. Despite the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1973 and the closing of the major industrial polluter in 1986, Onondaga Lake remained one of the most polluted lakes in the United States until several initiatives, including a 15-year multi-stage program completed in late 2017, allowed the lake to reach criteria required by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. This includes implementing a long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring program to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy.

The lake is included in an ongoing land rights action filed by the Onondaga Nation, which seeks the return of its ancestral homelands to promote environmental protection in conjunction with affirming Haudenosaunee sovereignty: “Onondaga Lake is the birthplace of Haudenosaunee democracy. Subsequently and consequently, the lake is the founding site of democracy for the U.S. people and, as such, should be protected as a national treasure instead of the chemical cesspool it has become.”

==History==

=== Haudenosaunee history and land tenure ===
Onondaga Lake is the birthplace of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, a Confederacy of Indigenous Nations made up of the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca, and after 1772, the Tuscarora. The names of the Nations are directly connected to their ancestral homelands in current northwest New York State. Mohawk translates to people of the flint, Onondaga to people of the hills, Oneida to people of the standing stone, Cayuga to people of the marshy area, and Seneca to people of the great hills. According to Grand River Mohawk scholar Susan M. Hill, “Among the Haudenosaunee, the names that the nations call themselves (and each other) denote key geographical features of their home territories… The recognition of geographic identity demonstrates the relationship to the land the people came from, the land they belonged to.”

According to Joyce Tekahnawiiaks King, a Mohawk Turtle Clan member who served as a political administrator, Federal Justice of the Peace, director of the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force, and advisor to the New York State Department of Conservation Environmental Justice Committee throughout her career, the Haudenosaunee have responsibilities to the land and water they came from: “We speak in terms of responsibilities with respect to water, not in terms of water rights… From time immemorial, we have held the view that the ‘law of the land&#x27; is not man-made law, but a greater natural law, the Great Law of Peace. This law, in our view, is divine. The Haudenosaunee have a deep respect for the waters of the Earth.” For the Haudenosaunee, law is made in cooperation with land and water.

Onondaga Lake is central to The Great Law of Peace, or Kayaneren’kowa. According to Haudenosaunee histories, the five Nations had fallen away from the Original Instructions of Skyholder, or the Creator, who mandated that humans cultivate the land and live alongside “all things that grow&quot; and game animals. Included in the Original Instructions was the Thanksgiving Address, or &quot;Ohenton Kariwatehkwen.&quot;

Water, including Onondaga Lake, is central to the Thanksgiving Address: “We give thanks to all the Waters of the world. We are grateful that the waters are still here and doing their duty of sustaining life on Mother Earth. Water is life, quenching our thirst and providing us with strength, making the plants grow and sustaining us all. Let us gather our minds together and with one mind, we send greetings and thanks to the Waters.”

The Nations, who had “lost sight of the harmony and balance provided for in the Original Instructions” split into warring factions. The Peacemaker brought the Nations together on the shores of Onondaga Lake, where he united them under the Great Law of Peace and formed the Haudenosaunee Confederacy

The Haudenosaunee, or people of the longhouse, was founded as a conscious league based on principles of mutual respect and peaceful communication. The Onondaga Nation website describes this event as the formation of “the first representative democracy in the West.”

The event was recorded with the creation of the Hiawatha Belt, a wampum whose design would later be used as the Flag of the Iroquois Confederacy. This belt conveys the guiding principles of the Haudenosaunee, the story of the Great Peacemaker, and the founding of the league at Onondaga Lake.

Onondaga Lake remains a sacred site for the Haudenosaunee, which King directly connects to Haudenosaunee environmental protection and sovereignty: “The value of water and the meaning of water law for the Native American called the Haudenosaunee cannot be separated from a yet-more foundational discussion on Haudenosaunee sovereignty and the right to protect land and Creation must be understood… Views on sovereignty are dependent upon the level of regard one has for the land itself (water, of course, included).”

===Early European settlement===
Europeans began to learn about salt springs in the area in 1654, when the Onondagas revealed their presence to French explorers. Jesuit missionaries visiting the Syracuse region in the same time period were the first to report on salty brine springs around the southern end of what they called &quot;Salt Lake,&quot; known today as Onondaga Lake. The brine springs were reported to have extended around much of the lake for a distance of nearly 9 miles. They extended from the present-day towns of Salina through Geddes and from Liverpool to near the mouth of Ninemile Creek. European settlers, mostly trappers and traders, followed the Jesuit missionaries and French explorers into the Syracuse area during the 17th and 18th centuries. After the French and Indian War, British traders replaced the French, but encounters were limited.
British-American colonists began salt production in the area in the late 18th century. Following the victory of the United States in the American Revolutionary War, it made the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1788 with supposed Haudenosaunee negotiators who were unauthorized by the Nations.

Among its provisions was the transfer of the lands around the lake from the Onondaga Nation to local salt producers on the condition that the salt would be produced for the common use of everyone. By 1822, due to a high incidence of malaria, the lake&#x27;s water level was lowered after its outlet to the Seneca River was dredged. The low-lying swampy area, located in what is now the northern end of downtown Syracuse, was drained. The completion of the Erie Canal through New York State in the mid-1820s and the commercial production of salt brought an increase in settlement of the area. The lake&#x27;s western shore became increasingly industrialized as the nineteenth century progressed.

Onondaga Lake also became a popular resort area. By the late 19th century, its shoreline was dotted with hotels, restaurants, and amusement parks. The area was so popular that people traveled by railroad from as far as New York City to visit the lake. Fish from the lake were harvested and served in restaurants across the state.

===Industry===

Salt brine and limestone were the key raw materials for the production of soda ash, used to make the industrial products of glass, chemicals, detergent, and paper. The abundance of salt brine and limestone in Onondaga Lake&#x27;s watershed area attributed greatly for the industrialization along the lake&#x27;s shoreline. Beginning in 1838, New York State authorized the drilling of deep wells at several locations around the lake. The wells were intended to locate the source of the brine, but no source was located.

The Solvay Process Company, incorporated in 1881, began drilling deep test holes in the area south of Syracuse in 1883. The company&#x27;s main product was soda ash, integral to several industries. Eventually Solvay found halite deposits at a depth of below land surface in the southern end of Tully Valley. From 1890 to 1986, more than 120 wells were drilled into four halite beds on the east and west flanks of the valley. Soda ash production began in 1884. The company was producing about 20 tons of soda ash per day, dumping most of its waste material directly into Onondaga Lake. Eventually wastebeds were built along the southwest perimeter of the lake to contain the by-products of soda ash production. In 1907, the New York State Attorney General threatened the Solvay Process Company with legal action over the direct discharge of Solvay waste material into the lake.
As Syracuse&#x27;s population began to grow in the 20th century, a surplus of pollution hit the lake hard. This lake was so close to the city that the effects of people&#x27;s sewage, exhaust fumes, and dumping of unnecessary products all caused the lake to decline in popularity, fishing, and even swimming.

In 1920, the Solvay Process Company merged with four other chemical companies, forming Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation. In 1950 it began the production of chlorine by mercury cell in 1950. Mercury-contaminated waste was also dumped directly into Onondaga Lake. Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation became Allied Chemical Corporation in 1958. Its continued practice of allowing mercury into the lake led to the federal and state governments banning fishing in 1970, due to mercury contamination of the fish. The US Attorney General sued Allied Chemical to halt the dumping of mercury into the lake. It is estimated that Allied Chemical was dumping approximately of mercury into Onondaga Lake per day. In 1981 Allied Chemical Corporation become Allied Corporation; in 1985 it changed its name to Allied-Signal, Inc. when it merged with the Signal companies. The company announced that it would close its operations in Syracuse because of changes in environmental laws, and in 1986 began dismantling its facility.

In 1989, New York State filed a lawsuit against Allied-Signal, Inc. for its part in contamination of Onondaga Lake. New York State and Allied-Signal, Inc. signed an interim Consent Decree detailing the elements of a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to be undertaken of the lake. In compliance with the Consent Decree, the study was conducted by Allied-Signal, Inc. which became Honeywell, Inc. in 1999.

Non-salt-producing companies also became established along the Onondaga Creek valley from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century. Many of these companies drilled wells into the underlying sand to obtain water for cooling purposes. They were protecting dairy products and beer, storing perishable goods, and regulating temperature in office and storage buildings by such water use. Once used, the water was disposed of in nearby streams that drained to Onondaga Lake. This practice increased the salinity of the surface-water system.

==Parks and recreation==
=== Long Branch Park ===
Long Branch Park is a public park in Onondaga County, New York, located in the town of Liverpool at 3813 Long Branch Road near NYS Route 370 and John Glenn Boulevard. The park is located on the northern shore of Onondaga Lake near Onondaga Lake Park, but it has no formal relation to it and is operate separately.

=== Onondaga Lake Park ===
&quot;Onondaga Lake Park&quot; is another county park. It hugs the eastern shore of the lake and has its offices at 6790 Onondaga Lake Trail in Liverpool. The park offers seven miles of shoreline, with a variety of areas for family picnics, including developed areas in Willow Bay and Cold Springs.

=== Onondaga Lake Park Marina ===
The Onondaga Lake Park Marina is located on Onondaga Lake Parkway in Liverpool.

=== Wegmans Good Dog Park ===

The &quot;Wegmans Good Dog Park&quot; was the first of its kind in Central New York and is located in the &quot;Cold Springs Mud Lock&quot; section of Onondaga Lake Park. It is open from sunrise to sunset, seven days a week year round.

Dogs are allowed to exercise without leashes in a fenced-in area which includes an exercise area with tunnels, jumps and bridges complete with red fire hydrants.

Entrance to the park is located at 49 Cold Springs Trail in Liverpooloff NYS Route 370. Suggested donation of $1 per person at the main gate. The park is maintained with private donations.

=== Museums ===
====Mission of Sainte Marie====

The Old French Fort at the &quot;Mission of Sainte Marie&quot; was the site of an early attempt by French Jesuits and colonists to establish a base in Central New York. In the 1930s, the remains of the original fort were replaced with what was claimed to be a &quot;replica&quot; or reconstruction of the site. Subsequent research has revealed that it was a poor imitation.

In the 1980s, a decision was made to replace the structure with a historically accurate reconstruction. In addition, a visitor&#x27;s center was built. This is used for the display of archeological artifacts recovered from the area, in a more accurate and &quot;hands on&quot; &quot;living museum&quot;.

As of January 1, 2013, the Onondaga Historical Association (OHA) took over management of the Onondaga County facility known as &quot;Sainte Marie among the Iroquois&quot; located on the eastern shore of Onondaga Lake. The site is currently planning to repurpose the facility into a Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Heritage Center named Skä•noñh Center – Great Law of Peace Center. Skä•noñh, is an Onondaga welcoming greeting meaning Peace and Wellness.

====Salt Museum====

The Salt Museum was built around a still-standing boiling block chimney. It opened in 1933 during the Great Depression.

=== Events ===

*Syracuse Hydrofest - The North American championship of hydroplane racing - annual event in the &quot;Willow Bay&quot; area of &quot;Onondaga Lake Park&quot; in mid-June.
*Lights on the Lake - Onondaga Lake Park in Liverpool from late November to early January.

==Pollution==

=== Sewage wastewater ===

One major source of pollution for Onondaga Lake is municipal sewage. For years, Syracuse dumped human waste into the lake with little or no treatment. Before European settlement and the growth of a large population in the area, the lake was oligo-mesothropic, meaning that it contained low levels of aquatic plant blooms.

The high levels of ammonia and phosphates due to the dumping of sewage wastewater have led to excessive algae growth in the lake. When these excessive algae growths die, bacteria decompose the dead algae using large quantities of oxygen, which causes eutrophic and low-oxygen conditions. The low oxygen levels lead to the choking out of fish and plants, especially in the deeper areas of the lake. Eventually anoxic (oxygen-free) conditions set in parts of the lake and anaerobic decomposition takes place which emits harmful and foul-smelling gases like hydrogen sulfide.

Combined sewer overflow (CSO) also contributes pollution. In some areas of Syracuse, sewers carry both sanitary sewage and stormwater. During dry weather, these sewers carry all the sanitary sewage to Metro for treatment; however, during times of heavy rain or melting snow, the amount of water is greater than the capacity of the sewers. They overflow and discharge a combination of runoff and sanitary sewage into Onondaga Creek and Harbor Brook. Through these tributaries, the CSO eventually reaches Onondaga Lake. CSO has been generating concerns about bacteria. In the 1960s, Syracuse had ninety points where CSO could reach Onondaga Creek, Harbor Brook, or Ley Creek.

===Chemical pollution===
The Allied Chemical Corporation contributed greatly to the chemical pollution of Onondaga Lake. The surface water was found to be contaminated with mercury whereas the sediments are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, creosotes, heavy metals (lead, cobalt, and mercury), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorinated benzenes, and BTEX compounds (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, xylene). In Onondaga Lake the chlorinated benzenes are located in the southwest portion, in the form of a dense oily liquid that has settled into the sediments. These chemicals were intentionally dumped into the lake or unintentionally seeped in from upland toxic waste sites or from the Solvay wastebeds located at the southwest end of Onondaga Lake. Approximately of salty wastes made up of chloride, sodium, and calcium were dumped into the lake before Allied Chemical closed in 1986.

Mercury contamination has been a major pollution issue. Between 1946 and 1970, of mercury was discharged into Onondaga Lake by Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation. In 2002, the findings from the remedial investigation conducted by successor Honeywell, Inc., with the supervision of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), reported that mercury contamination was found throughout the lake: the most elevated concentrations were in the sediments of the Ninemile Creek delta and of the southwestern portion of the lake. A fishing ban was imposed in 1970 due to mercury contamination.

In June 2023, a scientific article was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association&#x27;s (JAMA) Open Network Journal, which explored the association between arsenic levels and cardiovascular disease in children who lived near the lake. The article, &quot;Exposure to Arsenic and Subclinical Cardiovascular Disease in 9- to 11-Year-Old Children, Syracuse, New York,&quot;&quot;&quot; explores the relationship between urinary arsenic, a heavy metal, and cardiovascular disease risk factors including blood vessel, and heart ventricle thickness. The study, done with 9-11 year old children, demonstrated a correlation between cardiovascular disease and high arsenic levels, as well as a correlation between high arsenic levels and children who lived in the southern and eastern areas near the bottom of Onondaga Lake.

===Mudboils===

Approximately south of Syracuse, the Tully Valley has unique hydro-geological features called mudboils. These mudboils are the cause of the excessive sedimentation of Onondaga Lake. The sediment enters Onondaga Creek, which flows north into the lake. Sediment loading is a problem because it degrades water quality, decreases water clarity, and reduces habitat for aquatic insects, fish spawning, and plants.

===Legal action and cleanup efforts===
====Sewage pollution cleanup====

The first steps taken to control sewage pollution occurred in 1907 with the creation of the Syracuse Interceptor Sewage Board. It served to address sewage-related problems in Onondaga Creek and Harbor Brook. In 1960, Onondaga County established a sewer district and built the Metropolitan Sewage Treatment Plant (&quot;Metro&quot;) on the south shore of the lake.

In 1987, Atlantic States Legal Foundation (ASLF), a Syracuse-based organization providing legal and technical assistance to citizens and organizations dealing with environmental problems, filed a lawsuit against Onondaga County alleging that Metro and the combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges were violating federal water pollution standards established under the Clean Water Act of 1972. The state of New York joined as a plaintiff with allegations that Onondaga County had also violated the New York State Environmental Conservation Law. In 1988, ASLF, the state of New York, and Onondaga County reached a settlement
outlined in a Consent Judgement which required the county to pay Upstate Freshwater Institute to create water quality models for the lake. These models would then form the basis for discharge limits imposed on the county&#x27;s Metro facility.
In 1990, the U.S. Congress created the Onondaga Lake Management Conference (Public Law 101-596, section 401). It ordered the group to develop a comprehensive revitalization, conservation, and management plan for Onondaga Lake that recommends priority corrective actions and compliance schedules for its cleanup. The Conference also called for coordination of implementing the plan. The largest responsibility of the Onondaga Lake Management Conference was the completion of the Onondaga Lake Management Plan.

In 1997, New York State, Onondaga County, and ASLF reached an agreement, the Onondaga Lake Amended Consent Judgement (ACJ), on municipal wastewater collection and treatment improvements. The ACJ called for a schedule to attain compliance with the Clean Water Act. The ACJ is a multi-year program designed to improve the water quality of Onondaga Lake while achieving full compliance with state and federal water quality regulations by December 1, 2002. ACJ projects are divided into three main categories: wastewater treatment, collection system, and lake and tributary monitoring. In January 1998, a federal judge approved the ACJ and in September 1999, the Onondaga Lake Management Conference approved and endorsed the Amended Consent Judgment (ACJ). It incorporated the ACJ into its 1993 Onondaga Lake Management Plan entitled, &quot;A Plan of Action.&quot;

The final stage for ammonia discharge improvements occurred in 2004. The biological aerated filter (BAF) system allows for year-round nitrification of wastewater. In 2004, Metro&#x27;s annual ammonia discharge was reduced to 152 metric tons and by 2005, the annual discharge fell to 21 metric tons. The ACJ also led to the creation of an ambient monitoring program (AMP) to track the effectiveness of the improvements made to the wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure. The AMP is designed to identify sources of materials to the lake, evaluate in-lake water quality conditions, and examine the interactions between Onondaga Lake and Seneca River. Since 2007, Onondaga Lake has been in full compliance with the ambient water quality standards for ammonia. It was officially de-listed for that particular parameter in the State&#x27;s 2008 list of impaired bodies of water.

The ACJ achieved other successes. Between 1993 and 2006, the phosphorus discharges from Metro were decreased by 86%. Regarding contamination via CSOs, the ACJ required that by 2010 the county eliminate or capture for treatment 95% of the CSO volume generated during heavy rain and snow melt.

====Chemical pollution cleanup====
In 1989, the State of New York filed a lawsuit against Allied-Signal, Inc. The lawsuit sought to compel the company to clean up the hazardous wastes that it and its predecessors had dumped into and around the lake. In 2005, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Record of Decision that outlined the remediation plans of Onondaga Lake. The Federal Court approved a Consent Decree in 2007, obliging Honeywell International, Inc. to implement the NYSDEC/EPA cleanup plan for the contaminated sediments in the bottom of the lake. Honeywell signed the Consent Decree that same year and began the Remedial Design and Remedial Action for the Onondaga Lake Bottom Site.

The cleanup plan called for the dredging of up to 2.65 million cubic yards of contaminated sediments to a depth that will allow for a cap to be built without losing any lake surface area. The plan also called for the installation of a barrier wall made of steel on the southwest corner of the lake to prevent contamination from the wastebeds from getting into the lake. In 2011, Honeywell completed second-phase construction on this barrier wall. The estimated cost of the cleanup plan was $451 million; an estimated $414 million in order to construct the remedy, followed by an annual maintenance cost of $3 million.

Dredging began in July 2012. The sediments were hydraulically dredged from the bottom of the lake and piped to a sediment consolidation area in Camillus, New York. The dredging was completed in November 2014, a year ahead of schedule, having removed approximately 2.2 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment.

The plan called for a cap covering of lake-bottom. Capping began in August 2014, and was completed in 2016. Habitat restoration was completed in November 2017.

In 2015, the EPA&#x27;s first five-year review found that the addition of diluted calcium nitrate solution was effective in containing methylmercury (MeHg) in deep areas of the lake, which helped reduce MeHg concentrations throughout the lake and in zooplankton. At depths of , the amount of MeHg has decreased by 97% since 2006.

Audubon New York honored Honeywell with the 2015 Thomas W. Keesee Jr. Conservation Award for its role in “one of the most ambitious environmental reclamation projects in the United States.”

As part of the scope of the cleanup project, Honeywell has funded and operates the Onondaga Lake Visitors Center, which opened in 2012. The center, located on land owned by the New York State Department of Transportation adjacent to Honeywell&#x27;s cleanup headquarters on the southwestern shore, presents information about the ongoing cleanup.

The Onondaga Nation is not content with the Remedial Action plan for the Onondaga Lake Bottom Site. Their website states that the dredging plan will not include the additional 8 million cubic yards that the NYSDEC found to be contaminated. They do not believe that isolation caps are a permanent, reliable form of containment. The caps will not cover the entirety of the lake-bottom and they will eventually fail. The Onondaga Nation has said that New York State goals do not include making the lake swimmable or fishable, which are criteria included in the Clean Water Act. The total estimated plan, according to Onondaga Nation, of a thorough cleanup would cost $2.16 billion.

In addition, the Onondaga Nation seeks biocultural restoration beyond improving water quality. According to Citizen Potawatomi plant biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer, who lives in the vicinity of Onondaga Lake in Syracuse,In the Indigenous worldview, a healthy landscape is understood to be whole and generous enough to be able to sustain its partners. It engages land not as a machine but as a community of respected non-human persons to whom we humans have a responsibility. Restoration requires renewing the capacity not only for “ecosystem services” but for “cultural services” as well. Renewal of relationships includes water that you can swim in and not be afraid to touch. Restoring relationship means that when the eagles return, it will be safe for them to eat the fish. People want that for themselves, too. Biocultural restoration raises the bar for environmental quality of the reference ecosystem, so that as we care for the land, it can once again care for us.In 2022, the lake was declared to be at its cleanest in 100 years.

====Sedimentation control====
Since 1992, the Onondaga Lake Partnership has supported the efforts of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in the following remedial activities: the diversion of surface water away from the mudboils, the installation of a dam on the stream that flows from the mudboils area, and the drilling of wells to reduce the pressure around the mudboils (21). The installation of several depressurization wells has led to dramatic decreases in sediment loading; an average of 30 tons per day was reduced to 1 ton per day.

===Fishing improvements===

Dating back to the 1600s, Onondaga Lake has always shown reports of a cold-water system supporting certain types of fish. Around the late 1800s, degradation occurred and the fish that once thrived in the lake such as the American eel, Atlantic Salmon and Whitefish declined. The decrease in population resulted from the increase in temperatures because of severe pollution and human activities taking place. Even though the species are starting to gain numbers in this lake once again, the evidence shows that pollution had a direct impact on the fish that once inhabited this environment.

A survey in 1928 showed the lake was habitat for only ten remaining species. After clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers found a total of 54 species of fish captured in the lake between 1990 and 1999. The quality of sport fishing for large and small-mouth bass has gained national acclaim.

In 2011, Brown Trout were listed among Onondaga Lake&#x27;s Common Species, and Lake Sturgeon, stocked in nearby Oneida Lake, had returned. In addition, in recent years, areas around the lake have become an overwintering spot for bald eagles, a demonstration that the fishing is good.

According to Kimmerer, these improvements are both the work of restoration efforts and the water itself:Engineers, scientists, and activists have all applied the gift of human ingenuity on behalf of the water. The water, too, has done its part. With lessened inputs, the lakes and streams seem to be cleaning themselves as the water moves through. In some places, plants are starting to inhabit the bottom. Trout were found once again in the lake and when water quality took an upward turn it was front-page news. A pair of eagles have been spotted on the north shore. The waters have not forgotten their responsibility. The waters are reminding the people that they can use their healing gifts when we will use ours.In 1999, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) lifted the advisory on eating bass, white perch, and catfish from Onondaga Lake. The advisory against eating walleye remained in effect; and women of childbearing age, infants, and children under the age of 15 were advised against eating any of the fish from the lake. In 2007, the NYSDOH updated its advisory, prohibiting the consumption of largemouth and smallmouth bass over 15-inches-long. No walleye, carp, channel catfish, and white perch of any size should be consumed. The Department of Health advises not more than four meals per month of brown bullhead and pumpkinseed, and not more than one meal per month of any species not listed.

==Onondaga sovereignty and environmental justice ==
The lake is also subject of a land right action filed on March 11, 2005, by the Onondaga Nation. The Onondaga Nation has been seeking the return of its land for over 200 years because its land was unlawfully ceded by “unauthorized Onondaga negotiators” in 1788. The Onondaga did not want monetary reparations for the land, but the rights to the land. A newspaper article published in the New York Times on March 31, 2005, states, “What they want is influence in major policy discussions affecting the ecosystem in their ancestral lands. They also hope to use a favorable judgment to buy land to increase agricultural and housing opportunities, protect ancestors’ gravesites and safeguard the environment.” The Onondaga Nation sought the protection and conservation of the natural resources within and affecting the Nation&#x27;s land, and the security of Onondaga rights to hunt, fish, and gather resources for subsistence and cultural needs. According to Sid Hill, the Tadodaho of the Haudenosaunee, the Onondaga people want the water, land, and air returned to its condition prior to being illegally taken by New York State in the 18th and 19th centuries. Hill considers the degraded state of Onondaga Lake as evidence that neither New York State nor federal authorities can adequately care for the land and water resources.

According to Kimmerer, “The Onondaga land rights action sought legal recognition of title to their home, not to remove their neighbors and not for development of casinos, which they view as destructive to community life. Their intention was to gain the legal standing necessary to move restoration of the land forward. Only with the title can they ensure that mines are reclaimed and that Onondaga Lake is cleaned up.”

The land rights action was dismissed by a federal judge on September 22, 2010. The judge claimed that the suit “came too late and would be disruptive to people settled on the land.” The Onondaga Nation then took the suit to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2014, and the commission allowed the Nation to pursue two of its claims in May 2023.

The Onondaga Nation sees the environmental protection of Onondaga Lake as inextricably tied to fights for Haudenosaunee sovereignty and justice for nonhuman actors: “The Onondaga people still live by the precepts of the Great Law and still believe that, in return for the gifts of Mother Earth, human people have responsibility for caring for the nonhuman people, for stewardship of the land. Without title to their ancestral lands, however, their hands were tied to protect it.”

According to Kimmerer and researchers at the Onondaga Environmental Institute, the Onondaga land rights action is both a fight for Haudenosaunee sovereignty and environmental justice. Tom Perreault, a geography professor at Syracuse University, collaborated with Sarah Wraight and Meredith Perreault at the Onondaga Environmental Institute, a non-profit focused on “environmental research, education, planning and restoration in Central New York” on “Environmental Injustice in the Onondaga Lake Waterscape, New York State, USA,” in which they say, “Onondaga leaders argue that infringement of their nation’s traditional resource use rights and desecration of its aboriginal territory, especially places like Onondaga [L]ake that are central to its culture, have harmed their people’s cultural, economic, physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.” Further, Kimmerer quotes Clan Mother Audrey Shenandoah: “In this action, we seek justice. Justice for the waters. Justice for the four-leggeds and the wingeds, whose habitats have been taken. We seek justice, not just for ourselves, but justice for the whole of Creation.”

Onondaga Nation is also seeking avenues for cooperation via the precepts of the Kaswentha, or Two-Row Wampum. The Kaswentha is a treaty belt that represents a 17th-century agreement between early Dutch settlers and the Haudenosaunee based on mutual respect. The wampum depicts two ships: one, a Dutch sailing ship, the other a Haudenosaunee birch bark canoe.

Kimmerer argues that the precedent of the Kaswentha demonstrates the Onondaga Nation’s negotiating skills: “The Onondaga Nation, perhaps the oldest continuing democracy on the planet, protected much of its land and lifeways from the European settlers’ encroachment through skillful negotiations, beginning with the [Kaswentha] and continuing through subsequent treaties based on the same principles of sovereignty and mutual respect.

Former chief of the Saint Regis Mohawk tribe and first director of the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force James Ransom and anthropologist Kreg Ettenger argue for a system of environmental cooperation based on the principles of the Kaswentha and Haudenosaunee teachings: “As in the past, when our two societies would come together to face a common enemy or scourge, the key to success in forming partnerships lies in focusing on the river that we travel, not on the vessels and their differences. With respect to contemporary environmental problems, the Kaswentha provides a useful and powerful image for partnerships based on protection of the natural world.” This system of environmental cooperation would include valuing both indigenous knowledge and western knowledge systems to enter into collaborative partnerships. These partnerships would necessitate the recognition and protection of the “sovereignty and autonomy of each society (the ship and canoe) while allowing for the sharing of information and ideas and the creation of mutually acceptable solutions.&quot;

Ultimately, the Onondaga Nation seeks to restore Onondaga Lake to a state that supports and honors both human and non-human life, even if full restoration may no longer be possible: “Restoration is imperative for healing the earth, but reciprocity is imperative for long-lasting, successful restoration. Like other mindful practices, ecological restoration can be viewed as an act of reciprocity in which humans exercise their caregiving responsibility for the ecosystems that sustain them.”

<doc id="653106" wikidata="Q1928550" url="?curid=653106" title="Pulau Ubin">
<text>Pulau Ubin, also simply known as Ubin, is an island situated in the north east of Singapore, to the west of Pulau Tekong. The granite quarry used to be supported by a few thousand settlers on Pulau Ubin in the 1960s, but only about 40 villagers remained as of 2012. It is one of the last rural areas to be found in Singapore, with an abundance of natural flora and fauna. The island forms part of the Ubin–Khatib Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of visiting and resident birds, some of which are threatened. Today, the island is managed by the National Parks Board, compared to 12 agencies managing different areas of the island previously.

==Etymology==
The name Pulau Ubin literally means &quot;Granite Island&quot; in Malay, which explains the many abandoned granite quarries there. &quot;Pulau&quot; means &quot;island&quot;, and &quot;Ubin&quot; is said to be a Javanese term for &quot;squared stone&quot;. To the Malays, the island is also known as &quot;Pulau Batu Ubin&quot;, or &quot;Granite Stone Island&quot;. The rocks on the island were used to make floor tiles in the past and were called &quot;Jubin&quot;, which was then shortened to Ubin.

The island is known as &quot;tsio̍h-suann&quot; in the Taiwanese Romanization of Hokkien, which means &quot;stone hill&quot;. The highest point is Bukit Puaka (Haunted Hill in Malay) at a height of 75 m.

===Legend===
Legend has it that Pulau Ubin was formed when three animals from Singapore (a frog, a pig and an elephant) challenged each other to a race to reach the shores of Johor. The animals that failed would turn to stone. All three came across many difficulties and were unable to reach the shores of Johor. Therefore, the elephant and pig together turned into Pulau Ubin whilst the frog became Pulau Sekudu or Frog Island.

==History==
Pulau Ubin first appeared on map in an 1828 sketch of the Island of Singapore as &quot;Pulo Obin&quot; and in Franklin and Jackson&#x27;s map as &quot;Po. Ubin&quot;. Since the British founding of Singapore, the island has been known for its granite. The numerous granite quarries on the island supply the local construction industry. The granite outcrops are particularly spectacular from the sea because their grooves and fluted sides create furrows and ridges on each granite rock slab. These features are captured in John Turnbull Thomson&#x27;s 1850 painting — &quot;Grooved stones on Pulo Ubin near Singapore&quot;.

The granite from Pulau Ubin was used in the construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse. &quot;Tongkangs&quot; ferried the huge rock blocks (30 by 20 feet) from the island to Pedra Branca, the site of the lighthouse, in 1850 and 1851.

Later, the granite was also used to build the Singapore-Johor Causeway. Most of the quarries are not in operation today and are being slowly recolonised by vegetation or filled with water. Apart from quarrying, farming and fishing were the principal occupations of the inhabitants of the island in the past. It is also called &quot;Selat Tebrau&quot; (&quot;tebrau&quot; is a kind of large fish).

In the 1970s as the granite quarries closed down and jobs dwindled, residents began leaving.

===Human settlement===
In the 1880s, a number of Malays led by Endut Senin from the Kallang River were said to have moved to the island that began the thriving Malay community on the island.

Many of the former kampung on Pulau Ubin were either named after the first person who settled in the kampung or by some feature in the area. Kampung Leman was named by Leman; Kampung Cik Jawa by a Singaporean named Jawa; and Kampung Jelutong from people from Changi and from its &quot;jelutong&quot; trees. During the 1910s the island was home to a number of German-run coffee plantations. One of the German residents who died in 1914 is commemorated at the German Girl Shrine. During the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore in WW2, the island was captured and occupied by the Imperial Japanese army on the night of 7th February 1942 as a diversionary attack on Singapore. A few Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded in the conquest of the island by a few soldiers and natives who put up a fight. The Japanese created havoc on the island and executed and wounded many locals on the island. 

During the 1950s and 1970s, there were 2,000 people living on the island and the Bin Kiang School was established in 1952 for the increasing number of children, from money donated by the Chinese residents. Lessons prior to this were conducted on the village wayang stage. With a student population that once numbered 400, enrolment fell as the Singapore mainland developed. The school closed in 1985, and was demolished on 2 April 2000. There was also a private Malay school around 1956 at Kampung Melayu, which closed in the late 1970s.

Pulau Ubin was found to be suitable for the construction of several campsites. Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) was established in 1967 at Pulau Ubin, by Dr Goh Keng Swee, while the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) opened its 25-hectare site camp located between Kampung Bahru and Kampung Noordin. The camp is called Camp Resilience where Secondary 2 and 3 NPCC cadets have a 3-day 2 night stay for training. Secondary 2 NPCC cadets go to Adventure Training Camp (ATC) while Secondary 3 NPCC cadets go to Survival Training Camp (STC). lt was opened officially on 10 August 2004.

On 3 June 2005, the Singapore Government ordered that all the farmers rearing poultry on the island were to ship them to mainland Singapore and rear them in government-approved farms by 17 June 2005, in the wake of the avian influenza. In exchange, the local inhabitants were offered HDB government housing packages, although they could choose to live on the island.

As of 2012, there are only 40 people living on the island.

==Present-day==

Pulau Ubin is one of the last areas in Singapore that has been preserved from urban development, concrete buildings and tarmac roads. In the 1990s, the government approved land reclamation plans for Chek Jawa and when the plans were made public in 2001, it drew public criticism, with Singaporeans making appeals to the government to preserve the biodiversity of Chek Jawa instead. After a biodiversity survey conducted by conservationist volunteers in December, 2001, it resulted in the plans being postponed by the government, with the Ministry of National Development stating that the island would not be developed if there is no need for it to be.

Outlined in Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)&#x27;s 1993 master plan, there were plans to build an MRT line connecting the island and Pulau Tekong to mainland Singapore as well as HDB apartments on the island by 2030. In 2013, these plans were removed from URA&#x27;s updated master plans and authorities announced that there are currently no plans to develop the island.

Pulau Ubin&#x27;s wooden house villages and wooden jetties, relaxed inhabitants, rich and preserved wildlife, abandoned quarries and plantations, and untouched nature make it the last witness of the old kampung Singapore that existed before modern industrial times and large-scale urban development.

===Ubin Town===
Ubin Town is the only settlement on the island. Located near Ubin Jetty, many businesses in the village cater mainly to visitors to the island, with various bicycle shops, restaurants and provision shops dotting the village centre. A Chinese opera stage, managed by the village temple (Fo Shan Teng Tua Pek Kong Temple) is also located in the village centre; it is one of the last three Chinese opera stages that has survived in Singapore. The platform is a characteristic of Southern Chinese temples, where Chinese opera and Getai performances can be held during important festivals presented to the deities of the temple.

=== Future developments ===
In the URA 2011 concept plan, Pulau Ubin is poised to be developed when Singapore&#x27;s population exceeds a threshold of 6.9 million. According to the plan, HDB flats and a bridge would be built to connect the island with the mainland and Pulau Tekong. However, the government has also stated that it would preserve the island in its current state for as long as possible.

==Local tourism==

Although the island attracted attention for development and planning only in recent years, Pulau Ubin has been popular with Singaporean visitors for recreational activities such as summer camps and outdoor activities. With growing attention and interest in nature, visitors to Pulau Ubin has increased over the years, where according to the National Parks Board, the island sees an estimated 300,000 visitors annually. Pulau Ubin Recreation Area, which included Chek Jawa, was created to cater to local tourism. The site is about 700 hectares within the 1,020-hectare Pulau Ubin.

Amongst the various popular attractions on the island is Chek Jawa, a previous coral reef 5,000 years ago, Chek Jawa can be said to be virtually unspoilt. The wetlands are unique as several ecosystems can be observed in one area and supports a variety of marine wildlife comparable to other islands, such as sea hares, sea squirts, octopuses, starfishes, sand dollars, fishes, sponges, cuttlefishes and nudibranches.

A boardwalk runs through the mangrove, allowing visitors to observe the plant and marine life at close range. During low tide, a limited number of people are allowed to walk on the tidal flats. The prominent Chinese temple, Fo Shan Teng Tua Pek Kong Temple, is also another frequently visited site.

===Mountain biking===
Mountain biking is a popular activity on Pulau Ubin and the island is home to one of Singapore&#x27;s mountain bike trails, Ketam Mountain Bike Park which was built in 2007. The trail is approximately 8 kilometres long, varies in elevation and features a wide range of terrain from open meadows to thick jungle and is well-marked with signs indicating the difficulty level of each section. While a large proportion of visitors to the island bring their own bicycles, rental cycle vendors are prevalent in Ubin town.

==Transport==
Visitors may travel to Pulau Ubin from the main island of Singapore via a 10-minute bumboat ride from the Changi Point Ferry Terminal (previously known as the Changi Village jetty). In 2008, the one-way ticket price was increased from S$2.00 to S$2.50 per passenger. It was further increased to S$3.00 from 7 September 2015 onwards. Since June 2022, it has been S$4.00. Every bumboat can carry 12 passengers and the captain will wait until his boat has reached the maximum capacity. People who do not want to wait can pay S$48.00 for the whole bumboat and leave without waiting.

Transportation around the island can be either be done via bicycles of which the rental price range anywhere from S$8.00 to S$27.00 (for the entire day) depending on the condition of the bike, number of gears etc. For longer distance travel around the island, individuals can call taxi service (which is arranged by small coach buses), to get to scenic spots there. 

==Ecological projects==

===Hornbill Conservation Project===
The National Biodiversity Centre, in partnership with Wildlife Reserves Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and researchers Marc Cremades and Ng Soon Chye, implemented the Hornbill Conservation Project to aid in the breeding and recovery of the Oriental pied hornbill (&quot;Anthracoceros albirostris&quot;) which had previously become extinct in Singapore but has since started to re-establish itself in places like Pulau Ubin and Changi.

Hornbills require tree cavities to nest in. However, tree cavities of sufficient size to accommodate the female hornbill and her young are not common in Singapore. The implementation of artificial nest boxes at Pulau Ubin and Changi have been successful and video cameras are even installed within the nest boxes to provide a better understanding of the behavioural and feeding patterns of these birds.

===Seahorse Monitoring Project===
Since May 2009, the National Biodiversity Centre, together with volunteers from National Parks Board and nature groups such as Wild Singapore and TeamSeaGrass, initiated a project to monitor identified populations of seahorse (&quot;Hippocampus kuda&quot;) and pipefish (&quot;Syngnathoides biaculeatus&quot;) in several locations including Pulau Ubin for conservation management purposes. The data gathered will help to estimate the population size, growth rate of individuals and track their movements in their natural habitats.

==In popular culture==
* In 1989, TCS (now renamed Mediacorp), filmed a television drama named &quot;Good Morning, Sir&quot;. The drama was set in the 1950s where a woman from the main island of Singapore went to Pulau Ubin to work as a teacher. 

* In 1999, Mediacorp filmed a Channel 8 television drama called &quot;My Teacher, My Friend&quot; about the lives of students in the primary school that used to exist on Pulau Ubin.
* In 2006, Mediacorp broadcast a Kids Central (now Okto on 5) television drama series titled &quot;Ubin Boy&quot;. The plot revolved around two main characters, Steven (a mainland citizen) and his cousin Ah Boy living in Pulau Ubin.
* In the Danny Wallace book &quot;Yes Man&quot;, Wallace visits Pulau Ubin after it is suggested to him (and to which he must agree) after he visits Singapore. He is told the island is a paradise and must visit it by a local taxi driver.
*&quot;The Amazing Race 25&quot; visited this island when the teams arrived in Singapore.
*Mediacorp filmed a Channel 8 television drama called &quot;Hand In Hand&quot; in 2015 about four siblings in search of a suspicious figure on Pulau Ubin who looks like their father.

<doc id="653109" wikidata="Q805748" url="?curid=653109" title="Baltimore Orioles (1882–1899)">
<text>The Baltimore Orioles were a 19th-century professional baseball team that competed from 1882 to 1899, first in the American Association and later in the National League. This early Orioles franchise, which featured six players (Wilbert Robinson—C, Dan Brouthers—1B, Hughie Jennings—SS, John McGraw—3B, &quot;Wee Willie&quot; Keeler—RF, and Joe Kelley—LF) and a manager (Ned Hanlon) who were later inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, finished in first place for three consecutive seasons (1894–1896) and won the Temple Cup national championship series in 1896 and 1897.

Despite their success, the dominant Orioles were contracted out of the National League after the 1899 season, when the league reduced in size from 12 members to eight. Most of the Orioles&#x27; best players moved to the Brooklyn Superbas—Baltimore owner Harry Von der Horst also had an ownership stake in Brooklyn.

Upon the foundation of the American League in 1901, a reorganized Baltimore Orioles franchise competed as a charter member for two seasons, before folding and being replaced by the New York Highlanders, later renamed the New York Yankees.

==History==

===American Association===
The team, formally the &quot;Baltimore Base Ball and Exhibition Company&quot;, was founded in 1882 as a charter member of the American Association (AA), considered a major league. The Orioles finished last in the league in four of their first five season, the exception being a sixth-place finish in 1884 when 13 different teams played in the league. The team then had its best positional finish, third place, in 1887, followed by two seasons finishing fifth in the then eight-team league.

The Orioles dropped out of the league after the 1889 season, and began the 1890 season playing in the minor-league Atlantic Association.

However, when the last-place Brooklyn Gladiators of the AA folded in late August, the Orioles re-joined the AA and played 38 games to complete the 1890 season, posting a record of 15–19 with four ties. The Orioles remained in the AA for 1891, finishing sixth among nine teams in the AA&#x27;s final season.

Overall, during 10 seasons of AA play, the Orioles had a cumulative record of .

===National League===
The Orioles were one of four AA clubs (the others being the Louisville Colonels, St. Louis Browns, and Washington Statesmen) merged into the National League (NL) in 1892, formally as a 12-member &quot;League Association&quot;. The beginnings of the team can be traced to June 1892, when owner Harry Von der Horst hired Ned Hanlon to be manager of the Orioles, giving him stock in the team and full authority over baseball operations. Hanlon moved his growing family to a house that stood a block away from the team&#x27;s ballpark.

After finishing last in the league in 1892 and eighth in 1893, the Orioles won three consecutive pennants during 1894–1896, featuring several future Hall of Famers under manager Hanlon. They followed up the title run with two second-place finishes, in 1897 and 1898. Accordingly, they participated in all four editions of the post-season Temple Cup series, held from 1894 through 1897 between the NL&#x27;s top two teams, winning in 1896 and 1897.

After the team&#x27;s 1898 second-place finish, most of the team&#x27;s stars were moved to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, who were renamed as the Superbas for 1899 and eventually became known as the Dodgers. The players moved when Von der Horst and Hanlon became part owners of the Brooklyn team, with Hanlon also becoming Brooklyn&#x27;s manager. Third baseman John McGraw and catcher Wilbert Robinson remained in Baltimore, with McGraw remaining as first-year player-manager. Following a fourth-place finish in 1899, the Orioles were one of four clubs eliminated by the NL (the others being the Cleveland Spiders, Louisville Colonels, and the aforementioned Washington Statesmen, then known as the Washington Senators).

During their eight seasons of play in the NL, the Orioles compiled an overall record of .

===Later developments===
In the eight-team NL of 1900, McGraw and Robinson joined the St. Louis Cardinals.

In 1901, McGraw followed through on his threats to abandon the NL and form a club in the rival American League (AL), being formed by new president Ban Johnson out of the former minor-league Western League. These newly formed Orioles of the AL only stayed in Baltimore for two seasons.

In 1903, a team was established in New York City as &quot;the price of peace&quot; as agreement between the older circuit (the NL) and its new upstart rival (the AL) allowing the &quot;Americans&quot; to have a team based in the city as a sign of respectability. The AL team in New York became known as the New York Highlanders (or occasionally the New York Americans), later renamed in 1913 as the New York Yankees. The Yankees do not consider the 1901–1902 Baltimore team as part of their history.

In 1903, an Orioles franchise in the old minor-league Eastern League filled the void left by the departure of the major-league Orioles.

These minor-league Orioles included local product and future baseball icon Babe Ruth and Lefty Grove. The team won a string of seven straight titles, 1919–1925, at the then highest level of the minor leagues in the reorganized International League (known as such from 1912 onward).

A major-league franchise did not return to Baltimore until the St. Louis Browns (not the Browns of the AA, but a team that had its origins in Milwaukee) relocated to the city in 1954 and was renamed as the current Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball.

===Ballparks===

The Orioles of the American Association first played at Newington Park for the 1882 season.

Starting in 1883, the team played at the old Oriole Park, in Harwood, south of the Waverly neighborhood at 29th and Barclay Streets, just a block west from Greenmount Avenue, remaining there into the 1891 season. The 1901–1902 American League team played at Oriole Park a decade later.

During the 1891 season, the Orioles moved a few blocks away to Union Park on Huntington Avenue (later renamed 25th Street) and Greenmount Avenue. The team remained at Union Park for its entire time in the National League, 1892 through 1899.

==Stars==

The original Orioles were one of the most storied teams in the history of the game. Managed by Ned Hanlon, they won NL pennants in 1894, 1895, and 1896, and sported some of the most colorful players in history including John McGraw, Wee Willie Keeler, Hughie Jennings, Joe Kelley, Wilbert Robinson, and Dan Brouthers.

They were rough characters who practically invented &quot;scientific&quot; baseball, the form of baseball played before the home run became the norm in the 1920s. Like the style known today as &quot;small ball&quot;, the &quot;inside baseball&quot; strategy of Orioles featured tight pitching, hit and run tactics, stolen bases, and precise bunting. One such play, where the batter deliberately strikes the pitched ball downward onto the infield surface with sufficient force such that the ball rebounds skyward, allowing the batter to reach first base safely before the opposing team can field the ball, remains known as a Baltimore chop.

Matt Kilroy pitched a no-hitter for the Orioles on October 6, 1886; Bill Hawke threw one on August 16, 1893, the first from the modern pitching distance of 60feet, 6inches; and Jay Hughes threw a no-hitter for the Orioles on April 22, 1898.

<text>Lake Rotoroa lies within the borders of Nelson Lakes National Park in the South Island, New Zealand. The lake is fed by the D&#x27;Urville and Sabine rivers.

The greatest depth is 145 metres, and it has a surface area of just under 23.5 km. The lake is surrounded by beech forest. Rotoroa is a small community at the base of the lake. The Gowan River flows out of the lake at this point, thus making the lake one of the sources of the Buller River system.

The Rotoroa Route, following the northeast side of the lake, has been permanently closed to public access. Several other walking tracks can be accessed near the settlement at the head of the lake, and a water taxi travels the length of the lake to ferry trampers.

The lake has introduced trout, which attract recreational fishermen. There is a fly-fishing lodge, Lake Rotoroa Lodge, on the lake.

The word &quot;rotoroa&quot; is Māori for &quot;long lake&quot;.

<text>Otsego Lake is a lake located in Otsego County in the U.S. state of New York. It is the source of the Susquehanna River and largest lake in Otsego County. The Village of Cooperstown is located at the lake&#x27;s southern end. Glimmerglass State Park is located on the lake&#x27;s northeastern shore, and includes Hyde Hall, a large mansion constructed in 1817, that overlooks the lake. The Glimmerglass Opera, opened in June 1987, is located on the western shore.

Between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation filled the valley. Otsego Lake was formed when an ice tongue from a glacier carved out the Susquehanna River Valley. As the glaciers melted slowly, they filled in the valley they carved out. The lake takes its name from the Iroquois Indians, who inhabited the area around the lake in and before the 17th century. The name &quot;Otsego&quot; is from a Mohawk or Oneida word meaning &quot;place of the rock&quot;, referring to the large boulder near the lake&#x27;s outlet, today known as Council Rock.

The lake&#x27;s role in the state and local economy has led to a concentrated effort to protect and manage it. In 1935, the New York State Conservation Department performed the first biological survey of Otsego Lake. In 1968, the State University of New York at Oneonta (SUNY Oneonta) gained access to the lake, a location to build a field station and a biological research facility. Also at this time, the Otsego County Conservation Association (OCCA) was formed by a group of local landowners and sportsmen concerned about the water quality. SUNY Oneonta and OCCA collaborate on water quality improvement projects. The Otsego Lake Association, a not for profit group, makes sure that the Otsego Lake Watershed Management Plan is enforced. Today the lake is used recreationally and for sporting activities such as fishing.

==Geography==
Otsego Lake is long with a surface area of . Its average depth is , with a maximum depth of . The northern roughly of the lake is in the town of Springfield and the southern part in the town of Otsego, and bordered by the town of Middlefield on the eastern shore. The lake is the source of the Susquehanna River, which flows south through New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland before emptying into the Chesapeake Bay. The lake level is controlled by a dam that was built in 1905.

===Sunken islands===
Sunken Island is a submerged sandy plot located near the western shore of Otsego Lake, approximately north from Cooperstown. It is the supposed remains of an island described in the writings of James Fenimore Cooper upon which a structure once stood. Today Sunken Island is several feet below the surface of the lake and is marked with four buoys to prevent boats from running aground. Another sunken island, Eel Island, is located approximately north of Cooperstown. It is much deeper than the other sunken island.

=== Bays and points ===

There are many bays on Otsego Lake and four of them are named. One is Blackbird Bay, which located on the southwest end of the lake in the Village of Cooperstown. The next bay north of Blackbird Bay is Muskrat Cove, also known as Rat Cove. Waterlily Bay is a bay located on the west side of the lake about from the foot of the lake. Then on the northern end of the lake is Hyde Bay. Glimmerglass State Park is located in this bay. Hyde Bay is named after the Hyde family.

There are many points on Otsego Lake and many of them are named. On the southwest part of the lake is Brookwood Point. About further north is Three Mile Point. About farther north is Five Mile Point. Mohican Brook enters the lake at Five Mile Point. Just north from Five Mile is Six Mile Point. Continuing further north about is Hutter Point.

On the east side of the lake just north of the outlet is Point Judith, is a projection into the east side of the lake. Point Judith is the location of the historic Kingfisher Tower. It was originally called Two Mile Point, but is now named after Judith Hutter from &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;. About further north is Point Florence. Roughly further north is Cherry Tree Point. About further north is Gravelly Point. Just north of Gravelly is Peggs Point. On the north end of the lake, west of Hyde Bay, is Clarke Point.

=== Adjacent mountains ===

One mountain near the lake is Mount Wellington, which is located on the north end of the lake, east of Hyde Bay. It is known as &quot;The Sleeping Lion&quot;, as it looks similar to a lion laying down, viewed from Cooperstown, New York. It was named by George Hyde Clarke in honor of Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who went to Eton College in England with Clarke. Red House Hill is located on the west side of the lake, west of Six Mile Point. Mount Ovis is located on the west side of the lake behind the Farmer&#x27;s Museum. It was named around 1813, by James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s grandfather, who kept on it some of the first imported Merino sheep (Ovis aries). Mount Vision is located on the east side of the lake by the south end. Mount Vision was named by Judge Cooper, and is the location where his father first saw the lake.

== History ==
===Natural history===
About 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, during the Wisconsin glaciation, a glacier slowly moved through and carved out a valley that Otsego Lake now sits in. As the glacier slowly melted, it filled in the valley that was carved out. The glacier exposed limestone in the lake&#x27;s watershed, which now flows into the lake through the various tributaries. The limestone protects the lake from the damaging effects of acid rain.

There are various features surrounding the lake that are evidence of the glacier. These include moraines, drumlins, hanging deltas, clays and sands. There is also evidence that shows a previously higher lake level had existed, known as &quot;Lake Cooperstown&quot;. The Cassville-Cooperstown moraine follows the Oaks Creek valley, crosses the Susquehanna roughly south of the lake&#x27;s outlet and appears again in Cherry Valley, which is the next valley to the east. Near where this moraine crosses the Susquehanna, it rises to an elevation of , except for a sharp cut that the Susquehanna River now flows through. The cut is the location of the &quot;dam&quot; that held Lake Cooperstown at an elevation of around . Large terrace remnants are present around this location.

===Human history===

Before European colonization, Iroquois Indians inhabited the area around the lake. The name &quot;Otsego&quot; is from a Mohawk or Oneida word meaning &quot;place of the rock&quot;, referring to the large boulder near the lake&#x27;s outlet, today known as &quot;Council Rock&quot;. It is a large boulder whose top is above the water&#x27;s surface and can be seen from shore. At low water, the oval rock rises approximately above the water, and is about long by wide. It is believed to have been a meeting place for Native Americans prior to the American Revolutionary War. A small parcel of land near Council Rock was presented to the Village of Cooperstown in 1957, on the condition that it remain open to the public as a park. The park, today known as Council Rock Park, also includes a set of concrete steps leading to a lake-level terrace that were built in 1937.

Pieter Quackenboss, Jr (1710–1774), an early settler of the Mohawk Valley, dealt extensively with the natives and became known as &quot;The Old Indian Trader.&quot; The following incident in his life is recorded in the 1848 book Women of the American Revolution:
Pieter Quackenboss was among the early settlers of the [Montgomery] County, and did not escape the difficulties. He was a trader with the Indians, who placed great confidence in him, frequently consulting him. They were disposed to bestow on him some particular mark of regard, and after meeting for consultation, they decided on giving him the name &quot; Otsego&quot; and christening the lake for him. The ceremony of naming both him and the lake was performed by pouring liquor upon his head as he knelt on the ground, a portion being afterwards poured into the water. It is probable that few are acquainted with this origin of the name of Otsego Lake; but that family tradition has been confirmed by the recollection of some who witnessed the occurrence.
Early in 1779, General James Clinton and his soldiers began to haul 208 boats and all their supplies from the present day Villages of Fort Plain and Canajoharie, along the Mohawk River, towards Otsego Lake. By the end of June, they had made it to the lake and began to build a temporary dam at the outlet to raise the water level. The purpose of this was to break the dam and ride the flood water down the river to meet General John Sullivan at Tioga. This event is described by James Fenimore Cooper in the introduction to his popular novel &quot;The Pioneers&quot;, and commemorated by a Memorial Day canoe race.

In 1785, William Cooper settled at the south end of the lake and founded the settlement that is now known as Cooperstown. A few years after settling, there was a food shortage. Cooper stated:
A singular event deemed sent by a good Providence to our relief; it was reported to me that unusual shoals of fish were seen moving in the clear waters of the Susquehanna. l went, and was surprised to find that they were herrings (probably American shad, Alosa sapidissima). We made something like a small net, by the interweaving of twigs, and by this rude and simple contrivance we were able to take them in thousands. In less than two days each family had an ample supply.

Between 1817 and 1834, Hyde Hall was constructed at the north end of the lake. It is located within Glimmerglass State Park at the base of Mount Wellington. The building is a New York State Historic Site known as &quot;Hyde Hall State Historic Site&quot;. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. In 1825, Hyde Hall Bridge, a historic wooden covered bridge, was built on what was then Hyde Hall property. The bridge crosses the Shadow Brook tributary of the lake.

In 1858, the first commercial steamboat was put into operation on the lake, and by 1894, the number was up to ten. Two of them, the Natty Bumppo and the Cyclone, could hold more than 300 passengers per boat. At this time, commercial transportation on the lake was developed to fill in the gap between rail traffic entering from the Catskills into Cooperstown, to Richfield Springs where it accessed a railway that linked to a railway between Albany and Buffalo, and the Erie Canal. The last commercial steamboat went out of business in 1933.

In 1870, Elihu Phinney built a fish hatchery at Three Mile Point on the west side of the lake. Over the next few years thousands of fish were raised and released into the lake. In 1935, the New York State Conservation Department performed the first biological survey of the lake. In 1968, access to the lake and a location to build a field station and biological research facility were acquired by State University of New York at Oneonta (SUNY Oneonta). Also at this time, the Otsego County Conservation Association (OCCA) was formed by a group of local landowners and sportsmen concerned about the water quality. SUNY Oneonta and OCCA work closely together to plan and discuss water quality improvement projects. Glimmerglass State Park opened in the late 1960s.

In 1999, the Glimmerglass Historic District was formed, which includes the entire lake. The district covers parts of three towns, Otsego, Springfield, and Middlefield and also the village of Cooperstown. It includes 1,475 contributing features, including Hyde Hall in Glimmerglass State Park.

==Geology==
It is geologically related to the Finger Lakes, as they were both carved by glaciers, but is not counted among them. One difference is that Otsego Lake is situated at a higher elevation () than the Finger Lakes (approximately ). Another difference is the Finger Lakes are part of the Lake Ontario watershed, and Otsego is part of the Susquehanna River watershed. The lake is known for its deepness as well as the shallow littoral zone present around the majority of the lake. The shallow areas correlate to sediments deposited from tributaries that enter the lake. This is best shown at the north end of the lake where Trout Brook, Cripple Creek, and Hayden Creek enter the lake. It is also present in Hyde Bay where Shadow Brook enters, and at the south end of the lake between where Willow Brook enters the lake and Brookwood Point.

The water residence time for the lake is roughly 3 years. The majority of the water drains into the Susquehanna River, however evapotranspiration and loss to groundwater occurs but has not been measured as of 2017. Most substances that dissolve in the lake eventually leave the lake with the flow, with some serving as nutrients for organisms living in the lake. Due to water velocity slowing as the tributaries reach the lake, soil particles such as clay, silt, and sand, will usually remain within the lake longer than the water residence time. This over long periods of time can fill the lake basin in, which increases water levels. Short term problems occur as well, as lake trout were studied and found that they were not using their normal spawning beds, due to being buried in silt.

Otsego Lake is chemically eutrophic, which means that it is rich in nutrients and supports a dense plant population, the decomposition of which kills some animal life by depriving it of oxygen. It is also morphometrically oligotrophic, which means that its large size causes it to appear and function as a nutrient-poor lake although it receives a fair amount of nutrients. Many other lakes in this climate/area, such as Canadarago Lake just to the west, are smaller and shallower. In shallow lakes, algae that die fall to the bottom and decompose, which causes all of the oxygen at the lower levels to be used. This results in greater algae populations the next year and reduced sediments. However, with Otsego Lake being much deeper, the same amounts of nutrients entering are used by algae or lost into deep water. The algae still die and settle on the bottom, but due to higher oxygen levels, the oxygen isn&#x27;t completely exhausted. Therefore the majority of Otsego Lake is oligotrophic, with some of the shallow bays showing eutrophic characteristics.

==Watershed==

The Otsego Lake watershed covers approximately and includes parts of the towns of Otsego, Springfield, Middlefield, Warren and Richfield in the counties of Herkimer and Otsego in the State of New York. The watershed is 44% agricultural land, 36% forested, and 14.5% brushland. It is the headwaters of the drainage basin of the Susquehanna River which runs from Otsego Lake in Cooperstown to Havre de Grace where it flows into the Chesapeake Bay of the Atlantic Ocean. The lake is the drinking water source for the Village of Cooperstown and residents who live along the lake shores.

SUNY Oneonta maintains a Biological Field Station (BFS) that regularly takes phosphorus samples around the lake. Tributaries to the lake are the major source of phosphorus, contributing 75-88 percent. Shadow Brook contributes the highest, with Hayden Brook being the next highest. Rain and snow contribute 8-15 percent and on-site septic systems contribute 4-10 percent. There is also evidence of some internal recycling of phosphorus from the lake&#x27;s bottom.

==Conservation and management==

In 1870, a fish hatchery was built on the west shore of the lake. Over the years that it was in operation, over one million fish were stocked, including whitefish, landlocked salmon, black bass, California mountain trout, salmon trout and smelt. In 1935, as part of a wider survey of the Delaware and Susquehanna watersheds, the New York State Conservation Department studied the plankton, fish, plants, and physical and chemical properties of Otsego Lake. In 1968, access to the lake and a location to build a field station and biological research facility were acquired by SUNY Oneonta. Also at this time, the OCCA was formed by a group of local landowners and sportsmen concerned about the water quality. SUNY and the OCCA work together on water quality improvement projects. The main laboratory is located on the west shore of the lake just north of Cooperstown. Further north on the lake is the Thayer Farm, where the boathouse is located, that houses their research boats. Also the Otsego Lake Association, a not for profit group, makes sure that the Otsego Lake Watershed Management Plan is enforced.

In 2001, approximately of material was dredged from Clarke Pond on the northwest end of the lake. Also the aged leaking dam was repaired so it could continue to serve as a sediment detention basin. Funding was provided by a grant as well as from the Clark Foundation, property owners and the BFS. From 2002 to 2003, four wetlands in the watershed were restored under the oversight of Ducks Unlimited. Funding was provided by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Monitoring was conducted by BFS of the sites to determine the influence of the projects on water quality, as well as floral and fauna. In 1999, the village of Cooperstown received a $5,600 grant from the NYSDEC, to purchase lighted buoys to mark a no-wake zone, that extends from shore. Since then, additional buoys have been purchased. A team of BFS divers install and remove the buoys each year. Signage regarding the no-wake zone is posted at access sites to the lake.

===Invasive species===

Zebra mussels were first introduced into the Great Lakes in the mid- to late-1980s from ballast discharged from freighters originating in the Black and Caspian Sea region of eastern Europe and western Asia. They first became established in Otsego Lake in 2007, and by 2010, carpeted most of the lake trout spawning areas. The mussels impact fry numbers by covering shallow rocky shoals and deep water rocks, where they spawn. The mussels, in high densities, block eggs from being protected in the rocks, making the eggs more vulnerable to predators. Native freshwater pearly mussels have also been negatively impacted by zebra mussels. Six different species of clams once occupied the soft bottoms, but as of 2016, no live clams were observed. In a 2013 study of the lake, other invasive species were found, including eurasian milfoil, japanese knotweed, purple loosestrife, curly leaf pondweed, rusty crayfish, and starry stonewort. In August 2020, the BFS announced that quagga mussels were discovered in the lake.

In 2003, the village of Cooperstown began a boat inspection system at the village boat launch. From May through October, all incoming boats and trailers are inspected. If any evidence exists that boats have been on other bodies of water, the boats are escorted to a washing station. The town of Springfield owned launch later started a similar program.

===Pollution===
When Glimmerglass State Park was opened in the 1960s, a sand-filtered, wastewater treatment system was built. This system allowed some pollutants to enter the lake through Shadow Brook, which increased nutrient levels in the lake. A new filtration system was built at the state park by 1977. Eutrophic indicators decreased from 10.4 percent in 1973, to 1.4 percent in 1981. By 1988, there were significant reductions in phosphorus concentrations as well. Then between 1988 and 1994, total phosphorus concentration increased, due to old septic systems around the lake failing as well as runoff from farms and forests. As a result, a ban on phosphate-containing detergents was enacted.

In 1998, the Village of Cooperstown switched from using sand to provide winter traction on the streets to using salt. Later BFS tests showed that the change had reduced phosphorus runoff significantly. Another factor that increased phosphorus input were the outdated septic systems around the lake. In 2004, an inventory was completed for all septic systems along the lake, including type, age, and maintenance history. In 2005, a five-year program of inspections was started, to perform a visual inspection of the septic tank, an inventory of wastewater discharges from the house, and an inspection of the absorption area. If a system failed, the owner had a year to replace and upgrade the system.

== Recreation ==
=== Fishing ===
On Otsego Lake, lake trout are the main species targeted by fishermen, as well as walleye and yellow perch. The lake also supports an exceptionally large smallmouth bass population. Other fish species present in the lake are brown trout, rock bass, largemouth bass, chain pickerel, Otsego bass, bluegill, redfin pickerel, pumpkinseed, and landlocked atlantic salmon. The lake is stocked each year with approximately 5,000 brown trout that are long, approximately 5,000 lake trout that are long and between 40,000 and 80,000 walleye that are . Also 5,000 landlocked atlantic salmon that are long are stocked ly.

There is a boat launch at the south end of the lake maintained by the Village of Cooperstown and a boat launch at the north end of the lake that is only available to residents who live in the Town of Springfield, and is maintained by the Town of Springfield. In 1990, the NYSDEC announced plans to build a boat launch at Glimmerglass State Park, which caused a debate on the use of power boats on the lake. Opponents of the new boat launch wanted all boats banned on the lake except those powered by paddle, sail or battery. During the summer, there are multiple bass tournaments to show off who can catch the most impressive sized bass.

Since the disappearance of the alewife, the more balanced lake ecosystem has caused the rebound of yellow perch and walleye populations, due to no competition from the invasive alewife. In early 2017, BFS researchers installed transponder tags in 500 adult walleyes while they spawned in tributaries at the north end of the lake. Afterwards, a warmwater gill net survey was conducted to recapture tagged walleye for a population estimate. Yellow perch were the most numerous captured, followed by walleye. Just over 65 percent of walleye caught were legal to keep (≥ ). Smallmouth bass were the most numerous Centrarchid caught, with over 76 percent being legal (≥ ).

=== Public swimming areas ===

Three Mile Point is a public swimming beach located three miles from Cooperstown along the western shore of the lake accessible via State Highway 80. It is open June through August and offers changing rooms, a picnic area, and a pavilion. Another swimming area is Fairy Springs and is located one mile of Cooperstown along the eastern shore of the lake accessible via County Road 31. It is open May through September and offers changing rooms, a picnic area, and a pavilion. Another swimming area, Public Landing, is at the northern end of the lake located at the end of Public Landing Road. This swimming area is only open to residents who live in the Town of Springfield and has changing rooms and a picnic area. Another area is Glimmerglass State Park, which is located at the north end of the lake and is accessed by County Route 31. It offers a beach, many picnic areas and a few pavilions.

=== Lakefront park ===
Lakefront park is located in the village of Cooperstown on the lake and is accessed by Pioneer Street, Lake Street or Fish Road. At this park are benches to sit at and view the lake and a stage where concerts are held in the summer months. From lakefront park, Mount Wellington is visible at the other end of the lake. When viewed from this park, the mountain looks like a &quot;sleeping lion,&quot; which is the mountain&#x27;s nickname. Also located in the park are the village docks where spaces can be rented to dock a boat. Most of the docks were damaged in the floods of 2011, and some have since been replaced.

==Appearances in literature==

The lake was known to James Fenimore Cooper as &quot;Glimmerglass&quot; and was a principal feature in his novels &quot;The Pioneers&quot;, &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, and &quot;Home as Found&quot; in which local landmarks such as Council Rock, Hutters Point, Gravelly Point, and Sunken Island are mentioned. Set in 1740-1745, the historical novels describe the lake as being somewhat beyond the frontier, perhaps into French-controlled territory. When the novel was written in 1840, all of New York State was well within civilized territory. In the novel &quot;The Pioneers&quot;, Blackbird Bay is where Deerslayer rescues Ben Pump from drowning and the northern point that makes the Blackbird Bay is the location of an annual bass fishing expedition. In the novel &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, Gravelly Point is the location where Deerslayer is fired upon by a Huron Indian, then Deerslayer returned fire and killed the Huron. Also in &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, Peggs Point is the location where Deerslayer and Hurry Harry first reach the shore of Otsego Lake. It is also the location where Deerslayer departs the lake. Six Mile Point is the location in &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; that Natty Bumppo makes an unsuccessful effort to escape from the Hurons. In &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, Three Mile Point is the location where Hetty Hutter docks to seek the Huron Indian camp which was further south at Muskrat Cove. In &quot;Home as Found&quot;, Three Mile Point is referred to as Fishing Point and is owned by the Effingham family. Hutter Point is where Deerslayer first saw the &quot;Glimmerglass&quot;.

Otsego Lake is also referenced in &quot;The Secret of Mirror Bay&quot;, a novel in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series. In the story, Aunt Eloise invites Nancy and her friends to a cabin at Mirror Bay, in Cooperstown, to solve a case of a mysterious woman seen gliding across the water. Nancy is then involved in a vacation hoax because she resembles a woman involved in the hoax.

<text>Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) was a United States Navy squadron of World War II torpedo bombers. VT-8 was assigned initially to the air group of the aircraft carrier , joining the ship shortly after her commissioning in October 1941.

After heavy losses in the Battle of Midway, VT-8 was assigned to . When &quot;Saratoga&quot; was disabled on 31 August, VT-8 was transferred to Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, operating there until November 1942. Due to heavy cumulative losses on Guadalcanal, VT-8 was then withdrawn and disbanded.

A second VT-8 was established in 1943, and served on until the end of the war.

==Midway==
VT-8&#x27;s first and best-known combat mission came during the Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942. Flying obsolete Douglas TBD Devastators, all of Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron&#x27;s fifteen planes were shot down during their unescorted torpedo attack on Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft carriers. The squadron failed to damage any Japanese carriers or destroy enemy aircraft.

Only one member of VT-8 who flew from &quot;Hornet&quot; on that day survived in the action, Ensign George Gay. Gay was rescued the day following the battle. VT-8 was afterwards awarded the American Presidential Unit Citation.

Just prior to the Battle of Midway, the reconstituted VT-8 was the first squadron equipped with the new Grumman TBF-1 Avenger, a bigger, faster, longer-ranged replacement for the TBD. When &quot;Hornet&quot; sailed to the Pacific, a detachment of the squadron under the command of Lieutenant Harold &quot;Swede&quot; Larsen remained in Norfolk, Virginia to receive the first shipment of the new aircraft. Larsen&#x27;s detachment arrived at Pearl Harbor the day after &quot;Hornet&quot; sailed for Midway Island. Six of the squadron&#x27;s Avengers were flown to Midway under the command of Lieutenant Langdon K. Fieberling to participate in the battle. These planes were the first Navy aircraft to attack the Japanese fleet that day. They attacked without fighter cover, and five of the Avengers were shot down, with only Ensign Albert K. Earnest and Radioman 2nd Class Harry Ferrier surviving, on a badly shot-up plane with damaged controls and landing gear, and a dead rear-gunner.

VT-8&#x27;s losses have been attributed to several causes. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s CAG, Commander Stanhope C. Ring, kept the group&#x27;s fighter escort at high altitude in order to cover the dive bombers and to give the Wildcats an altitude advantage. This decision was supported by Admiral Marc Mitscher, then commanding officer of &quot; Hornet&quot;. The Wildcats&#x27; deployment was ultimately of no consequence, however, as Ring led the group on an incorrect heading, so the dive bombers never made contact with the Japanese fleet. Commander Waldron made repeated attempts to take over the formation by radio before leading VT-8 off on his own. Waldron&#x27;s initiative coupled with Ring&#x27;s faulty tactics led to VT-8 attacking the Japanese force without fighter or dive bomber support. It is important to note, however, that all of the carrier-based torpedo squadrons suffered heavily in the battle, including VT-3, which attacked with fighter escort.

Larsen&#x27;s detachment of VT-8 that remained at Pearl Harbor was loaded aboard when she was sent to reinforce the forces at Midway. They were later transferred to &quot;Hornet&quot; where they learned of the loss of their comrades. VT-8 was reconstituted with this detachment as nucleus and was reassigned to &quot;Saratoga&quot;.

==South Pacific==
VT-8 flew from &quot;Saratoga&quot; during the initial stages of the Guadalcanal Campaign. In the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, VT-8 assisted in sinking the light carrier . When &quot;Saratoga&quot; was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, the squadron was assigned to Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, where it served as part of the Cactus Air Force. VTR-8 fought there to the point where all aircraft were disabled, and then operated as a single-aircraft unit, as one plane at a time was put back into service by salvaging parts (often themselves damaged) from other planes. VT-8 pilots and air crew also participated in the ground defense of Henderson Field, assisting to fend off Japanese infantry attacks on 24–26 October 1942. VT-8&#x27;s last official mission was flown on 15 November 1942, against damaged transports from the last major Japanese convoy to the island. After leaving Guadalcanal and returning to the United States, the squadron was disbanded.

==Central Pacific==
A new Torpedo Squadron 8 was established in 1943 as part of the new Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8). It was assigned to the newly commissioned aircraft carrier at Norfolk in November 1943. After training in the Caribbean Sea, VT-8 left &quot;Intrepid&quot; at Pearl Harbor in January 1944. Here, VT-8 was assigned to , in March 1944. VT-8 attacked Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai on 30 March and 1 April 1944. Truk, Satawan, Ponape, and Hollandia on New Guinea were attacked a month later. CVG-8 then took part in the Marianas Campaign between 12 June and 10 August 1944. VT-8 flew sorties in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The Western Carolines were attacked in September, Okinawa, Luzon, and Formosa were attacked in October and November 1944. For this deployment on &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, CVG-8 was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.

In June 1945, VT-8 trained with USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;, but they did not deploy. CVG-8 (including VT-8) was disestablished after the end of the war.

==Awards==
Torpedo Eight earned two Presidential Unit Citations: one for Midway and one for Guadalcanal. Its members also earned more than fifty medals for valor in combat.

==Gallery==
==Literature==
Herman Wouk&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; pays tribute to Torpedo 8, whose pilots he called &quot;the soul of America in action.&quot;

Robert J Mrazek&#x27;s book &quot;A Dawn Like Thunder: The True Story of Torpedo Squadron Eight&quot; tells the story of VT-8 through interviews with surviving members, the official war record of the squadron and excerpts from letters written home by those who didn&#x27;t make it.

<text>Nelson Lakes National Park is in the South Island of New Zealand, at the northern end of the Southern Alps. It was created in 1956 (one of four created in the 1950s). The park contains beech forests, multiple lakes, snow-covered mountains and valleys created by glaciers during the ice ages.

== History ==
The lands and waters of Nelson Lakes National Park are of significance to many Māori nations partly because the waters of the lakes are important sources for the rivers running through various regions. These nations or iwi include: Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō, Ngāti Kuia, Rangitāne o Wairau, Ngāti Rārua, Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu, Ngāti Toa Rangatira and Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui and earlier, Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri. 

The colonial New Zealand Company claimed to have purchased a large area of the South Island including the area of the Nelson Lakes National Park in 1839, this was disputed and discredited in 1844. The disputed claims were settled in 1856, although the agreements were not honoured on the most part by the Crown and not all the iwi with interests were included in the settlement. The first national park in New Zealand was established in 1887. Pressure from Māori groups to preserve land and support amongst Pākehā advanced the national park movement. 

Nelson Lakes National Park was formed after the passing of the National Parks Act (1952) in 1956, also Fiordland (1952), Mount Cook (1953) and Urewera (1954) National Parks were created in the 1950s. 

== Geography ==
Nelson Lakes National Park covers some . The park is centered at two large lakes, Rotoiti and Rotoroa, and is bounded to the west by the Alpine Fault. The park also includes the surrounding valleys (including Travers, Sabine, D&#x27;Urville and the upper reaches of the Mātakitaki).

Mountain peaks in the park have elevations ranging from approximately to . Two permanent snowfields are located on Mt. Ella and Mt. Hopeless, and are the northernmost of this feature on the South Island. Mountain ranges intersecting the park include:
* the Ella Range, featuring Mount Magadalene reaching and Mount Ella 
* the Mahanga Range
* the Spenser Mountains
* the Travers Range, which includes Mount Hopeless at , Angelus Peak at and Mount Robert at 
* the Saint Arnaud Range, including Mount McKay at , the Camel, and Mount McRae at 

To the west of the park lies the Victoria Forest Park, and to the south lies the Lewis Pass Scenic Reserve and the St James Conservation Area. Northeast of the park is the Mount Richmond Forest Park.

The park is a popular area for camping, tramping and fishing. In 1959, The first park ranger was appointed in 1959. George Lyon, in this role, spent much of the 1960s building huts and making improvements to the tracks.

The park is administered by the Department of Conservation, which operates a visitor centre in Saint Arnaud that provides up-to-date and reliable information on all aspects of the National Park.

== Ecology ==
A wide variety of ecosystems exist within the park, in turn supporting many bird, amphibian and insect communities. Landscapes range from alpine scree to wetlands, tussocklands and upland mountain beech forests. Forests of mountain, red, and silver beech provide habitat for threatened kākā and kākāriki. However, birds and insects that relied on the honeydew production of the park&#x27;s beech forests have been severely negatively impacted by invasive wasps.

=== Flora ===
Nelson Lakes National Park is notable for its diversity of alpine flora. The park has few rare species of vegetation, with four currently listed as either threatened (consisting of three species of beech mistletoe) or endangered (&quot;Pittosporum patulum&quot;).

===Fauna===

==== Kererū ====
The first record of kererū or New Zealand wood pigeon in the national park is from Charles Heaphy in 1846 who &quot;obtained&quot; six of them in a day and a half. There is a population of kererū at Lake Rotoroa which is considered stable.

==== Kākāriki ====
The yellow-crowned parakeet were very common with &quot;hundreds&quot; near Lake Rotoroa around 1900. Although numbers have declined and they are considered rare, they can be spotted in many valleys of the national park. The red-crowned parakeet is considered possibly extinct within the park, while the orange-fronted parakeet (Kākāriki karaka) is considered extinct in the national park.

==== Kākāpō ====
Kākāpō were common in the national park in the 1800s. Mary Thornton described &quot;the kokapaw (kakapo)&quot; as &quot;good eating … all feathers really … you need at least a couple each for a good feed&quot; in the 1890s. She then commented that &quot;the kakapo seemed to vanish about the beginning of World War I&quot;.

==== Western weka ====
The western weka (&quot;Gallirallus australis australis&quot;) is considered rare in the Nelson Lakes area. They were common when Charles Heaphy visited Lake Rotoroa in 1846. Julius von Haast wrote in 1861 that &quot;no other bird being as numerous as the weka which was everywhere in the grassy plains, forests, as well as near the summits of mountains amongst sub alpine vegetation&quot;. Weka were common throughout the Nelson Lakes before a sudden decline in their numbers between March and April 1909.

==== South Island robin ====
The South Island robin (&quot;Petroica australis australis&quot;) can commonly be seen in Nelson Lakes National Park. They are a small bird that lives on a diet of insects, with grey colouring and a white patch on their lower chest area. They are a very inquisitive species and often approach visitors to the national park getting within metres of them. Younger birds have been known to stand on a person&#x27;s boot. They live in the forest and are often seen foraging on the ground. Their nests are at risk of predation from introduced mammalian species.

==== South Island kākā ====
Large populations of kākā existed in the national park in the 1800s with &quot;hundreds&quot; living around Lake Rotoroa by about 1900. The populations declined throughout the 20th century to the point that it was rare to see groups of more than five or six birds by 1991.

South Island kākā (&quot;Nestor meridionalis meridionalis&quot;) were rarely seen in the park in 2009. They were most abundant around Lakes Rotoiti and Rotoroa and have benefited from the extensive stoat trapping carried out by the Rotoiti Nature Recovery Project. Kākā are at risk from predation by stoats and possums.

==== Blue duck ====
The blue duck or whio (&quot;Hymenolaimus malachorhynchos&quot;) was common in the Nelson Lakes region in the 1800s with Julius von Haast noting in 1862 that &quot;It is found in all rivers, and is easily killed&quot;. During the Nelson Lakes National Park survey of 1978–1985 blue duck were only recorded in the Travers, Sabine, Glenroy and Matakitaki valleys, with the Matakitaki valley being home to the greatest numbers. By 2009, there were too few birds, especially females remaining in Nelson Lakes National Park, to ensure the continuation of the species without human help.
==== Cupola gecko ====
The Cupola gecko is so rare that few live specimens have ever been found. In 1968 one had been observed near Cupola Hut, and a further specimen had been found in 2007. Extensive searches in 2006 and 2019 failed to uncover any further examples of the species. However, in 2021, four examples were found in the Sabine Valley demonstrating that the species is not extinct.

The Cupola gecko is described as looking similar to other forest geckos, with grey-brown colouration and either darker or lighter W- or V-shaped bands across its back. The 2021 discoveries confirm that they live in alpine regions.

==== Long-tailed bat ====
The South Island long-tailed bat (&quot;Chalinolobus tuberculatus&quot;) were, in 1900, &quot;a common sight&quot; in the national park. A spot one kilometre to the east of St. Arnaud was known as &quot;bat cutting&quot;. They were observed to be declining in numbers by 1930 even though a colony of &quot;more than a hundred bats&quot; was observed. By the early 1990s, the species was classified as &quot;rare&quot; and numbers have declined further in the early 2000s in most valleys of the national park. They are still very occasionally seen by trampers.
==Conservation and human interaction==

===Management===
====Rotoiti Mainland Island====

The Rotoiti Mainland Island consists of 5000 hectares of beech forest around Lake Rotoiti. There is a project which aims to eliminate introduced pests such as stoats, possums, wasps and rodents, and allow recovery of the forests and native wildlife populations.

The Rotoiti Nature Recovery Project has been a success in that it has reduced predator numbers on the eastern side of Lake Rotoiti. It is possible to see great spotted kiwi, robins, bellbirds, fantails, rock wrens, keas and paradise ducks as a result.

===Access===

The main access point to Nelson Lakes National Park is at Lake Rotoiti and the village of Saint Arnaud, on , about 100 kilometres from both Nelson and Blenheim. A secondary access point is at Lake Rotoroa, turning off at Gowanbridge. Shuttle services operate between St Arnaud, Nelson, Blenheim and Picton.

===Activities===

==== Camping ====
The main campgrounds are on the shores of Lake Rotoiti; there is a smaller campground at Lake Rotoroa.
==== Tramping ====
There is a network of tramping tracks throughout the park. Tracks range from short nature walks at Lake Rotoiti and Lake Rotorua, to multi-day backcountry tramps. Day tramps include the Lake Rotoiti circuit, St. Arnaud Range and Mt. Robert. The most popular long-distance tramping routes are the Travers-Sabine Circuit and other loops through Lake Angelus. The Te Araroa trail also passes through the park over Waiau Pass.

==== Skiing ====
Rainbow Ski Area is located on the eastern side of the St Arnaud range, just outside the park on the slopes of Mount McRae.

The skifield on Mount Robert is no longer operational. (Mount Robert was named by Julius von Haast after his son). The ski field was first scouted for potential in 1929 and between 1933 and 1934 the Kea hut was built and the ski field established. In 1944, the Nelson Ski Club was established. In the early days, accessing the ski field was a challenge. One had to row across Lake Rotoiti and then hike to the top of Mount Robert while carrying all of one&#x27;s ski gear. The ski field was closed in 2003. This was due to a lack of consistent snow and changes to when the school holidays fell during the year.

Other activities include mountaineering, boating, fishing and mountain biking.

==== Huts ====

Nelson Lakes National Park contains 20 Department of Conservation huts, ranging in quality from &#x27;basic hut/bivvy&#x27; to &#x27;serviced hut&#x27;. 
=== Mountain safety ===
Angelus Hut, which lies in an alpine environment at 1650 m above sea level, is one of the most popular huts in the national park. It can be accessed via the Robert Ridge route, amongst a number of others. However, the Robert Ridge route is considered one of the most dangerous routes of the park in bad weather. Between 2010 and 2019, search and rescue teams rescued 45 trampers, and there were two fatalities. This represented an incidence of 1 search and rescue for every 700 trampers making the trip. Snow and poor weather can occur at any time during the year, and the combination with easy access to Robert Ridge from St. Arnaud and the scenic location of Angelus Hut may cause trampers to underestimate the difficulty of accessing the hut. During winter months, Lake Angelus (adjacent to Angelus Hut) is generally frozen over, and each of the four routes to the hut are usually covered in snow and can be very icy.

After a tourist succumbed to hypothermia while tramping alone near Angelus Hut in July 2018, more initiatives were taken to raise awareness of harsh and variable conditions in the park. Inexperienced trampers are encouraged to avoid solo trips in alpine conditions or in winter, to be aware of the weather forecast, and to take an emergency shelter, navigation equipment and an emergency communication device.

<doc id="653125" wikidata="Q1276616" url="?curid=653125" title="Providence Grays">
<text>The Providence Grays were a Major League Baseball team based in Providence, Rhode Island who played in the National League from until . The Grays played at the Messer Street Grounds in the Olneyville neighborhood. The team won the National League title twice, in and . Following the 1884 season, they won the World Series over the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. The team folded after the season.

== Origins and formation ==

Rhode Island was a hotbed of baseball in the 1870s with several notable amateur clubs along with Brown University&#x27;s powerhouse collegiate team. In 1875, the semi-pro &quot;Rhode Islands&quot; were formed. After successful seasons (along with excellent paid attendance) in 1875, 1876, and 1877, the team drew the attention of the recently formed National League. When the League elected to drop the Hartford franchise after the 1877 season, Providence was awarded a franchise to replace the Connecticut club.

The new team was officially organized on January 16, 1878 by Benjamin Douglas, who became the team&#x27;s general manager. Henry Root was hired as the team president‚ and Tom Carey was initially hired to be the on-field captain, whose duties were similar to the modern-day manager. On January 21, 1878, Providence applied for membership in the NL, and was officially approved on February 6.

On April 10, Root took over ownership of the team, fired Douglas for incompetence and insubordination, and hired Tom York to replace Carey as captain. On May 30, the Providence Base Ball Association was incorporated by the Rhode Island General Assembly.

While the team practiced at the Dexter Training Ground in the spring of 1878, preparations were made to provide them with &quot;the best baseball plant in the country&quot;. Construction on the Messer Street Grounds began on April 1 and took exactly one month to complete; the final nail was hammered a mere five minutes before the opening game got underway on May 1.

The following season the team installed a screen behind home plate to protect the fans sitting there from injury due to foul balls and wild pitches. They were the first team in baseball history to do this; while some fans protested, complaining that they obstructed their view of the game, by the end of the next decade they were commonplace.

In a break with tradition, the National League&#x27;s newest addition adopted gray flannel instead of white for their home uniform and the team became known as the Grays.

== 1879 champions ==
One of the leading players from the 1879 pennant winner was Hall of Famer John Montgomery Ward.

The Grays may also have the distinction of being the first Major League Baseball team to field an African-American baseball player, William Edward White, a Brown University student who played one game for the Grays on June 21, 1879. While the evidence is strong, it is not conclusive: Peter Morris of the Society for American Baseball Research has researched this issue, as reported by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2004. Work by the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) suggests that he may have been the first African-American to play major league baseball, predating the longer careers of Moses Fleetwood Walker and his brother Weldy Walker by five years, and Jackie Robinson by 68 years.

== 1884 champions ==

The 1884 team was led by ace pitcher Charles &quot;Old Hoss&quot; Radbourn (sometimes spelled Radbourne), who won a record 60 (59, according to some sources) games that year and led the Grays to the pennant. When the team&#x27;s other star pitcher, Charlie Sweeney, defected to the rival Union Association league in July, it looked like the Grays&#x27; season was doomed, but &quot;Old Hoss&quot; offered to pitch the rest of the team&#x27;s games. The Grays went on a 20-game winning streak and topped the league ahead of their New England rivals, the Boston Red Stockings.

At the close of the season, Providence officials accepted New York Metropolitans (AA) manager Jim Mutrie&#x27;s challenge to a three-game postseason match. All of the games took place at the Polo Grounds in New York and were played under American Association rules, which forbade overhand pitching.

On October 23, 1884, the Providence Grays (NL) whitewashed the New York Metropolitans (AA), 6–0, behind Radbourn, in what is considered to be the first official postseason interleague game. Radbourn allowed two hits and struck out nine. Tim Keefe was the losing pitcher. The very next day, Radbourn three-hit the Metropolitans and won 3–1 in a game called after seven innings due to darkness. Grays third baseman Jerry Denny hit a three-run homer in the fifth inning. It was the first home run in World Series history. Keefe lost for the second time. On October 25, 1884 the Grays defeated the Metropolitans, 11–2, in the final game of the series. Radbourn won for the third time in three days. Buck Becannon took the loss as Keefe umpired the contest.

Although post-season games prior to 1903 were considered exhibitions, the 1884 World Series is recognized today as the first inter-league postseason championship. This would be Providence&#x27;s last appearance in a World Series. Due to financial problems, the team folded in 1885.

== Other highlights ==
Other memorable highlights of the Grays&#x27; short existence include the second perfect game in MLB history, pitched by John Montgomery Ward on June 17, 1880; a no-hitter by Charles Radbourn on July 25, 1883; and pitcher Charlie Sweeney striking out 19 batters in a nine-inning game on June 7, 1884, a record that would stand until broken by Roger Clemens 102 years later. They also still hold the record for the largest score in a shutout victory, with a 28–0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on August 21, 1883.

<text>The John H. Chapman Space Centre () is the headquarters of the Canadian Space Agency. It is located in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada, in the borough of Saint-Hubert.

==Location and name==

The centre has a total surface area of 41 hectares (101 acres) located on the border of the Saint Hubert airport, a general aviation facility. The building is supposed to look somewhat like a space station.

The building was finished in 1992 and named Canadian Space Agency Headquarters, and in 1996, it was renamed the John H. Chapman Space Centre in honour of John Chapman for his accomplishments in the Canadian Space Program and because of his role in the Alouette 1 program.

==Programs==

The centre houses the Canadian astronaut office and most of the administrative and technical units supporting Canada&#x27;s programs in space sciences and technology. This includes satellite control rooms, the Protein Crystal Growth Mission Support Centre, and simulators for the Canadarm2, the Mobile Servicing System, and the Advanced Space Vision System. It also houses the Mission Operations Centre (MOC) that includes the Remote Multi-Purpose Support Room (RMPSR) that is used to operate the MSS on-orbit in conjunction with the flight control and mission evaluation rooms at the Johnson Space Center as well as the Operations and Engineering Centre (OEC) which supports the flight controllers at JSC. As the headquarters for the space agency, it also houses many offices for general administrative functions or for specific programs such as exchange activities with NASA, ESA, ISRO and other national space agencies.

<text>Delta Burke McRaney (born July 30, 1956) is an American actress, producer and author. From 1986 to 1991, she starred as Suzanne Sugarbaker in the CBS sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot;, for which she received two Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

Burke&#x27;s other television credits include &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; (1982–83), &quot;Delta&quot; (1992–93), &quot;Women of the House&quot; (1995) and &quot;DAG&quot; (2000–01). She has produced and starred in made-for-TV movies, appeared in the film &quot;What Women Want&quot; (2000), and had a recurring guest role in the drama series &quot;Boston Legal&quot; (2006–07). She has also starred in the Broadway productions of &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (2003) and &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (2005).

==Early life and Miss Florida==
Burke was born on July 30, 1956, in Orlando, Florida, to a single mother, Jean. Frederick Burke, an Orlando realtor, adopted her after marrying her mother. She has never met her biological father. Burke has two younger siblings: Jonathan and Jennifer.

Burke graduated from Colonial High School in 1974, and won the senior superlative &quot;Most Likely to Succeed.&quot; In 1972, she won the Miss Flame crown from the Orlando Fire Department and went on to become State Miss Flame. In her senior year of high school, she won the Miss Florida title for 1974; she was the youngest Miss Florida titleholder in pageant history. Burke won a talent scholarship from the Miss America Organization, allowing her to attend a two-year study program at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.

==Career==

===Early career===
In 1974, as part of winning Miss Florida, Burke appeared on the ABC-TV show &quot;Bozo the Clown&quot;, filmed in Orlando, Florida. A 2001 episode of &quot;Lost Treasures of NFL Films&quot; presented film footage, taken by Lewis Bice, of her appearance as Miss Florida at the World Football League&#x27;s World Bowl that same year.

In 1980, Burke portrayed the role of the second Bonnie Sue Chisholm in the CBS western miniseries, &quot;The Chisholms.&quot; Burke spent a year on &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; in 1982 playing the wily young widow, Kathleen Beck. After that, she played football team owner Diane Barrow on &quot;1st &amp; Ten&quot; from 1984 to 1986.

===&quot;Designing Women&quot;===
In 1986, Burke was cast as Suzanne Sugarbaker in the CBS sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot;; she left &quot;1st and Ten&quot; in order to appear on the show. &quot;Designing Women&quot; was created by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who had previously cast Burke in her show &quot;Filthy Rich&quot;. The show was set at an interior design firm in Atlanta headed by four women, and Burke was one of the show&#x27;s four female leads. (Dixie Carter, another of the leads, had been the lead actress on &quot;Filthy Rich&quot;.) The show struggled in the ratings, and was even briefly cancelled after its first year, but in 1989 began to receive respectable ratings after being paired with the sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. Burke became the show&#x27;s breakout star, and earned two consecutive nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1990 and 1991; she was the only lead female cast member of the show to be nominated. (Alice Ghostley received a nomination for Supporting Actress in a Comedy in 1992, for her recurring role as Bernice Clifton, while Meshach Taylor received one in 1989 for Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.)

In 1990, Burke publicly expressed dissatisfaction with the show on a televised interview with Barbara Walters and other media outlets. She argued on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that there was a labor dispute, and actors were often forced to work over 15 hours per day, with executives even blocking the doors to keep actors on set. She also said that Dixie Carter, who had once been her close friend and maid of honor at her wedding to Gerald McRaney, was not speaking to her as Carter sided with her bosses. At the end of the fifth season of &quot;Designing Women&quot; in 1991, Burke was fired from the show due to her contentious relations with Carter and the Thomasons.

===1990s===
Burke was given her own vehicle with the sitcom &quot;Delta&quot; in 1992, in which she portrayed an aspiring country music singer. She dyed her hair blonde for the role. When ratings plummeted, Burke became a brunette again. The series was cancelled after one season. In 1995, she and Linda Bloodworth Thomason reconciled their differences, and Burke returned as Suzanne Sugarbaker in the &quot;Designing Women&quot; spinoff &quot;Women of the House&quot; (1995), but that show also met an early demise.

It took more than a decade for Burke and Carter to reconcile, but they did so when Burke guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Family Law&quot;, on which Carter was a regular cast member.

===Weight issues===
Since the early 1990s, Burke&#x27;s weight has been a subject of discussion in the tabloid press. Her struggles with weight, depression, and eating disorders stretch back to her pageant days in the early 1970s. She became a much-parodied figure in the press due to the media&#x27;s incessant obsession with her weight, including in a skit on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, wherein Leon Phelps from &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; has a sexual fixation with her. In 1989, Burke asked Thomason to write an episode addressing her weight. The episode, &quot;They Shoot Fat Women, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;, had Suzanne Sugarbaker going to her 15-year high school reunion and having her feelings hurt after hearing disparaging remarks about her weight. Her performance on this episode is said to have led to her receiving her first Emmy nomination as Best Actress.

===Later career===
Burke has been a leading actress in a number of television films, and had a supporting role in the Mel Gibson film &quot;What Women Want&quot; (2000).

In the early 2000s, she co-starred with David Alan Grier on the sitcom &quot;DAG&quot;; she had lost much of her excess weight for the role after being diagnosed with diabetes.

Burke made her Broadway debut in September 2003, when she starred as Mrs. Meers in the musical &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;. She was the third actress to play the role in the production, after Harriet Harris and Terry Burrell. She played the role until February 2004, before being succeeded by her &quot;Designing Women&quot; co-star Dixie Carter. Burke then played the role of Truvy in the original Broadway production of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;, playing the role for the shows entire four-month run from April 4 - July 31, 2005.

She also played Bella Horowitz during a five-episode arc on &quot;Boston Legal&quot; as a former flame of William Shatner&#x27;s character, Denny Crane, in season three.

Burke appeared in a Hallmark Channel film, &quot;Bridal Fever&quot;, which aired February 2, 2008.

In March 2012, Burke was cast in the ABC comedy pilot &quot;Counter Culture&quot;. However, after Burke fell on the set, production of the pilot was suspended and it was not picked up to series.

==Personal life==
Burke has been married to actor Gerald McRaney since May 28, 1989. They have no children together, although McRaney has adult children from his prior marriages. Burke and McRaney&#x27;s primary residence is in Los Angeles, California; they also own a house in Telluride, Colorado, and one in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Burke has been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes.

Burke is a supporter of gay rights, and has worked with openly gay playwright and screenwriter Del Shores on many occasions, in &quot;Sordid Lives&quot; and &quot;Southern Baptist Sissies&quot;. In 2006, Burke and openly gay Tennessee actor Leslie Jordan were uninvited from the Nashville talk show &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; after the show&#x27;s managing director decided the subject matter to be discussed would offend conservative viewers. Burke first became supportive of gay people and gay rights through attending acting school in London and also through her sister Jennifer, who is a lesbian.

Burke is a designer and manager of the clothing company &quot;Delta Burke Design&quot;, headquartered in New York City.

Burke and McRaney also own an antiques store in Collins, Mississippi.

Burke has compulsive hoarding syndrome, for which she received therapy. &quot;At one time I had 27 storage units. I don&#x27;t have a big enough house!&quot; she said. &quot;My mom had it, it&#x27;s my mother&#x27;s fault. She saved the diaper I came home from the hospital in!&quot;

<text>The Detroit Wolverines were a 19th-century Major League Baseball team that played in the National League from 1881 to 1888 in the city of Detroit, Michigan. In total, they won 426 games and lost 437, taking their lone pennant (and winning the pre-modern World Series) in 1887. The team was disbanded following the 1888 season.

==Franchise history==
Founded at the suggestion of Detroit mayor William G. Thompson, the Wolverines played the first game of major league baseball in Detroit on May 2, 1881, in front of 1,286 fans. Their home field was called Recreation Park, and it consisted of a wooden grandstand located between Brady Street and Willis Avenue. This stadium was demolished in 1894, though its location is indicated by a historical marker in what was once left field. The name of the ball club derives from Michigan being known as &quot;The Wolverine State;&quot; although the team name &quot;Wolverines&quot; is now primarily associated with University of Michigan sports, there was no connection between the University and the Detroit baseball team.

Though they folded after only eight seasons, the Wolverines occupy an important place in baseball history. On September 6, 1883, they conceded 18 runs in a single inning against the Chicago White Stockings, the most ever in MLB. In 1885, new owner Frederick Kimball Stearns began spending heavily in an attempt to create a &#x27;super-team&#x27; by buying high-priced players. Most notably, he purchased the entire Buffalo Bisons franchise that August, to secure the services of its stars: Dan Brouthers, Jack Rowe, Hardy Richardson, and Deacon White, the so-called &quot;Big Four&quot;. This strategy quickly met resistance from his fellow owners, who changed the league&#x27;s rules governing the splitting of gate receipts, reducing the visiting team&#x27;s maximum share to $125 per game. Detroit was not yet the Motor City, and its population was too small to support a highly paid team. The Wolverines&#x27; home gate receipts were not sufficient to sustain their payroll, and Stearns was forced to sell his stars to other clubs and disband the team after the 1888 season. The franchise&#x27;s place in the National League was taken by the Cleveland Spiders in 1889.

The Wolverines&#x27; most successful season came in 1887, when they were crowned as the champion of the National League with a record of 79 wins and 45 losses. After the season, they defeated the St. Louis Browns, champion of the rival American Association, in a series of exhibition matches, winning ten of the fifteen games played. These games were a predecessor to the modern World Series, which did not begin until 1903.

Three Detroit players hit for the cycle: George Wood on June 13, 1885, Mox McQuery on September 28, 1885, and Jack Rowe on August 21, 1886.

<doc id="653143" wikidata="Q8020288" url="?curid=653143" title="William Whitehead (Canadian writer)">
<text>William Frederick (Bill) Whitehead (August 16, 1931 – February 1, 2018) was a Canadian writer, actor and filmmaker. Whitehead is best known as a writer of radio and television documentaries and as the former partner of the late Canadian writer Timothy Findley.

==Background==
Whitehead was born in Hamilton, Ontario, to Marjorie and Berkeley Kyle Whitehead. His parents had moved there from Saskatchewan, and the family moved back to Regina when Whitehead was a child. His parents subsequently divorced due to his father&#x27;s epilepsy-related inability to maintain stable employment; Whitehead did not see his father again until his late teens.

His initial career goal was to become an entomologist — by age 12 he was already a member of the Saskatchewan Natural History Society — but he also had a passion for theatre. He studied biology and theatre arts at the University of Saskatchewan, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1953 and a Master of Arts degree in 1955, but decided against pursuing work as a biologist because he found it depended too strongly on having to kill animals.

He moved to Ontario in 1957 to become an actor, having several small roles with the Stratford Festival while serving as a propmaster and stage manager. He met Findley, at the time also a Stratford Festival actor, in 1962, with their lifelong relationship beginning when Findley appeared in a CBC Television production of Jules Feiffer&#x27;s play &quot;Crawling Arnold&quot; and Whitehead invited him over to watch it because Findley didn&#x27;t own a television set.

==Career==
When Findley left the theatre to concentrate on writing fiction, Whitehead simultaneously took a job writing science documentaries for the CBC Radio documentary series &quot;The Learning Stage&quot;. He remained a writer of radio and television documentaries, including the documentary film &quot;Fields of Endless Day&quot;, over 100 episodes of the CBC Television series &quot;The Nature of Things&quot;, and many episodes of the CBC Radio series &quot;Ideas&quot;.

He also co-wrote several works with Findley, including the television documentaries &quot;Dieppe 1942&quot; and &quot;The National Dream: Building the Impossible Railway&quot;. Whitehead and Findley won the ACTRA Award for Best Writing in a Television Documentary at the 4th ACTRA Awards in 1975 for &quot;The National Dream&quot;.

Following Findley&#x27;s death in 2002, Whitehead compiled and edited the posthumous collection &quot;&quot;. In March 2004, approximately two years after Findley&#x27;s death, Whitehead donated a collection of Findley&#x27;s theatre memorabilia to the University of Guelph. He subsequently began a new relationship, with Trevor Green.

In September 2012, his memoir &quot;Words to Live By&quot; was published by Cormorant Books. The book was a shortlisted nominee for the Stephen Leacock Award in 2013.

In 2014 he served on the jury of the Dayne Ogilvie Prize for LGBT writers, selecting Tamai Kobayashi as that year&#x27;s winner.

He died at his home in Toronto on February 1, 2018, having earlier been diagnosed with lung cancer.

<text>Bloodflowers is the eleventh studio album by English rock band The Cure. It was first released in Japan on 2 February 2000, before being released in the UK and Europe on 14 February 2000 and then the day after in the US by Fiction Records and Polydor Records. Initially the album was to be released in 1999, as it had been completed by May that year, but the record company wanted it to be released &quot;“post millennial fever.”&quot; 

Singer and frontman Robert Smith chose to not release any single from the album, against the will of the record company, which Smith has said was an act of &quot;revenge&quot; due to his dissatisfaction towards the lack of promotion the band&#x27;s previously released compilation &quot;Galore&quot; (1997) received from the record company due to conflicts of interests. However, &quot;Maybe Someday&quot; and &quot;Out of This World&quot; were issued as promotional singles to radio in the UK, US, Canada and numerous territories in Europe.

== Background ==
According to Robert Smith, &quot;&quot;Bloodflowers&quot; was the best experience I&#x27;ve had since doing the &quot;Kiss Me&quot; album. I achieved my goals, which were to make an album, enjoy making it, and end up with something that has real intense, emotional content. And I didn&#x27;t kill myself in the process.&quot; He also said that &quot;at the demo stage&quot; they had more commercial songs in mind for the album but &quot;they just sounded so shallow.&quot; 

Smith also took more control of the album&#x27;s sound, directing the band to produce a certain sound and mood for the album. The only song which had direct input from another member was &quot;The Last Day of Summer&quot; which was composed by bassist Simon Gallup. This led to more strict recording session than their previous album &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; (1996), due to Smith dominating the creative decisions on the albums, &quot;I saw them both (Simon and Roger) looking at each other murmuring &quot;Oh shit, this thing is happening again...“ but I think the result justifies this. Therefore we had a lot of stress in the band and in the end I stood there alone. All the others were gone because they got the feeling I wouldn´t listen to them. So I had to record the vocals alone. As they came back and listened to it they thought it was fantastic.“&quot;

Smith also had a shorter running time in mind, due to their previous release &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; having a run time of over an hour, which he remarked &quot;I find that seventy minutes of one artist is, almost without exception, too much.&quot; However, he struggled to reach his initial run time, which was 45 minutes, as he struggled to cut down the song&#x27;s length, due to his satisfaction with their sound. However, Smith had realised &quot;in hindsight, that it&#x27;s the songs themselves that probably need trimming back, but I think that they benefit from their length. I&#x27;ve done an edit of &#x27;Watching Me Fall&#x27; at home, and I got it down to under six minutes [from eleven minutes, thirteen seconds], but it’s just not the same song.&quot;

The only song which was not initially written for the album was &quot;There Is No If...&quot; which was written when Smith was 19, but never made it onto an album due to Smith&#x27;s initial reluctance to use the song calling it &quot;hippy-like&quot;, although he felt that the rendition which he recorded for &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; was suited for the feel of the album.

==Release and promotion==
No commercial singles were released from &quot;Bloodflowers&quot;, but two promotional singles were released to DJs and radio stations: &quot;Out of This World&quot;, in January (Europe) and May (US), and &quot;Maybe Someday&quot;, in January (US) and April (Europe). &quot;Maybe Someday&quot; managed to peak at No. 10 on the Alternative Airplay chart. &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; was a moderate success, debuting at number 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2001. In subsequent years, Smith identified it as his favourite Cure album in a 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview.

The second track on the album, &quot;Watching Me Fall&quot; was featured in the end credits of the 2000 horror film &quot;American Psycho.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Bloodflowers&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;one of the band&#x27;s most affecting works&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave a positive review of the album scoring it a 7.5/10, praising the album&#x27;s sound and concluded, &quot;&quot;Bloodflowers&quot; contains some classic Cure material, which is more than can be said of their catalog since &quot;Disintegration&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; titled their review &quot;Goth-Awful!&quot;, rating the album 1.5 out of 5. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the quality of the compositions, saying, &quot;[Smith] can write four bad songs in a row, and Cure albums tend to leak filler like an attic spilling insulation&quot; and concluded, &quot;&quot;Bloodflowers&quot;, is half dismissible droning, an unforgivable ratio considering it&#x27;s only nine tracks long.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Trouser Press&quot; stated in their review: &quot;The album sounds completely uninspired, as Smith and company go through the motions of Cure-ness.&quot;

&quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; wrote that the album featured &quot;endless songs&quot; with &quot;dated sounds&quot;. AllMusic noted that although &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; contained all the Cure&#x27;s musical trademarks, &quot;morose lyrics, keening vocals, long running times&quot;, &quot;the album falls short of the mark, largely because it sounds too self-conscious&quot;.
