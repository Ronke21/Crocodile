<text>Aplysia () is a genus of medium-sized to extremely large sea slugs, specifically sea hares, which are a kind of marine gastropod mollusk.

These benthic herbivorous creatures can become rather large compared with most other mollusks. They graze in tidal and subtidal zones of tropical waters, mostly in the Indo-Pacific Ocean (23 species); but they can also be found in the Atlantic Ocean (12 species), with a few species occurring in the Mediterranean.

&quot;Aplysia&quot; species, when threatened, frequently release clouds of ink, it is believed in order to blind the attacker (though they are in fact considered edible by relatively few species).

Following the lead of Eric R. Kandel, the genus has been studied as a model organism by neurobiologists, because its gill and siphon withdrawal reflex, as studied in &quot;Aplysia californica&quot;, is mediated by electrical synapses, which allow several neurons to fire synchronously. This quick neural response is necessary for a speedy reaction to danger by the animal. Aplysia has only about 20,000 neurons, making it a favorite subject for investigation by neuroscientists. Also, the &#x27;tongue&#x27; on the underside is controlled by only two neurons, which allowed complete mapping of the innervation network to be carried out.

==Long-term memory==
In neurons that mediate several forms of long-term memory in &quot;Aplysia&quot;, the DNA repair enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is activated. In virtually all eukaryotic cells tested, the addition of polyADP-ribosyl groups to proteins (polyADP-ribosylation) occurs as a response to DNA damage. Thus the finding of activation of PARP-1 during learning and its requirement for long-term memory was surprising. Cohen-Aromon et al. suggested that fast and transient decondensation of chromatin structure by polyADP-ribosylation enables the transcription needed to form long-term memory without strand-breaks in DNA. Subsequent to these findings in &quot;Aplysia&quot;, further research was done with mice and it was found that polyADP-ribosylation is also required for long-term memory formation in mammals.

In 2018, scientists from the University of California, Los Angeles, have shown that the behavioral modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory in &quot;Aplysia&quot; can be transferred by RNA.

== Operant conditioning ==
Operant conditioning is considered a form of associative learning. Because operant conditioning involves intricate interaction between an action and a stimulus (in this case food) it is closely associated with the acquisition of compulsive behavior. The &quot;Aplysia&quot; species serve as an ideal model system for the physical studying of food-reward learning, due to &quot;the neuronal components of parts of its ganglionic nervous system that are responsible for the generation of feeding movements.&quot; As a result, &quot;Aplysia&quot; has been used in associative learning studies to derive certain aspects of feeding and operant conditioning in the context of compulsive behavior.

In &quot;Aplysia&quot;, the primary reflex studied by scientists while studying operant conditioning is the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex. The gill and siphon withdrawal reflex allows the &quot;Aplysia&quot; to pull back its siphon and gill for protection. The links between the synapses during the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex are directly correlated with many behavioral traits in the &quot;Aplysia&quot; such as its habits, reflexes, and conditioning. Scientists have studied the conditioning of the &quot;Aplysia&quot; to identify correlations with conditioning in mammals, mainly regarding behavioral responses such as addiction. Through experiments on the conditioning of the &quot;Aplysia&quot;, links have been discovered with the synaptic plasticity for reward functions involved in the trait of addiction within mammals. Synaptic plasticity is the idea that the synapses will become stronger or weaker depending on how much those specific synapses are used. Conditioning of these synapses can lead them to become stronger or weaker by causing the neurons to fire or not fire when influenced by a stimulus. The conditioning of behavioral traits is based on the idea of a reward function. A reward function is when a stimulus is conditioned to fire according to a certain stimulus. The neurons will adapt to that stimulus, and fire those neurons more easily, even if the stimulus has a negative effect on the subject (in this case the Aplysia). In mammals, the reward function is mainly controlled by ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons. During conditioning (in mammals), the VTA dopamine neurons have an increased effect on the stimuli being conditioned, and a decreased effect on the stimuli not being conditioned. This induces the synapses to form an expectation for reward for the stimuli being conditioned. The properties of the synapses displayed in the tests on conditioning involving the &quot;Aplysia&quot; (which has dopamine neurons but not a ventral tegmental area) are proposed to be directly comparable to behavioral responses such as addiction in mammals.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Aplysia&quot; are simultaneous hermaphrodites, meaning each adult individual sea hare possesses both male and female reproductive structures that may be mature at the same time.

&quot;Aplysia&quot; have the ability to store and digest allosperm (sperm from a partner) and often mate with multiple partners. A potent sex pheromone, the water-borne protein attractin, is employed in promoting and maintaining mating in &quot;Aplysia&quot;. Attractin interacts with three other Aplysia protein pheromones (enticin, temptin or seductin) in a binary fashion to stimulate mate attraction.

Studies of multiple matings in the California sea hare, &quot;Aplysia californica,&quot; have provided insights on how conflicts between the sexes are resolved.

== Self-defense ==
&quot;Aplysia&quot; species was once thought to use ink to escape from predators, much like the octopus. Instead, recent research has made it clear that these sea slugs are able to produce and secrete multiple compounds within their ink, including the chemodeterrant Aplysioviolin and toxic substances such as ammonia for self-defense. The ability of the &quot;Aplysia&quot; species to hold toxins within their bodies without poisoning themselves is a result of the unique way that the toxin is stored within the slug. Different molecules essential to the creation of the toxin are accumulated in separate parts of the body of the slug, rendering them benign, as only the mixing of all the molecules can result in a toxic chemical cloud. When the sea hare feels threatened it immediately begins the process of defending itself by mixing the distinct molecules in an additional part of the body used specifically for that purpose. At which point, enzymes within the sea slug begin the process of making the substance toxic, and the mixture is ejected out at the predator in self-defense.

==Species==
Species within the genus &quot;Aplysia&quot; are as follows.

<text>A traditional economy is a loosely defined term sometimes used for older economic systems in economics and anthropology. It may imply that an economy is not deeply connected to wider regional trade networks; that many or most members engage in subsistence agriculture, possibly being a subsistence economy; that barter is used to a greater frequency than in developed economies; that there is little governmental oversight of the economy, that at least some taxes might be in the form of goods or corvée labor rather than money; or some combination of the above. Aspects of traditional economies often carry forward into the &quot;modern&quot; economies they become, though; it is not uncommon for a traditional economy that heavily centers the role of tribes and families in distributing wealth to continue keeping a large role for them even after connections to outside trade are formed, at least if the original elite manage to keep their status rather than being displaced by an invasion or revolution or the like.

<text>Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter is an independently made 1958 American black-and-white science fiction/horror film drama, produced by Marc Frederic and George Fowley, directed by Richard E. Cunha, that stars John Ashley, Sandra Knight, Donald Murphy, and Sally Todd. The film was distributed by Astor Pictures and was released theatrically as a double feature with &quot;Missile to the Moon&quot;.

The film, set in mid-20th century America, tells the story of the creation of the first female &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s monster&quot;.

==Plot==
Teenager Trudy Morton, who lives with her uncle Carter Morgan, has nightmares in which she is a monster running about the streets. Her boyfriend Johnny Bruder dismisses them. Unbeknownst to Trudy, she actually does turn into a monster at night, thanks to Carter&#x27;s lab assistant Oliver Frank. He lives with them and has been spiking Trudy&#x27;s fruit punch with the formula that he and Carter are developing at the home lab. Carter&#x27;s goal is to eliminate all disease so that people can live forever; Oliver&#x27;s goal is different: with the help of Elsu the gardener, he is assembling a &quot;perfect being&quot;, for Oliver Frank is actually Oliver Frankenstein, grandson of the original Dr. Frankenstein.

Carter&#x27;s project stalls and he breaks into Rockwell Labs for Digenerol, the chemical he needs for his experiments.

Police Lt. Boyd and Det. Bill Dillon investigate a report from a frightened woman that a monster in a swimsuit attacked her. They spot Trudy&#x27;s monstrous self and fire at her, to no avail. Oliver grabs her and drags her home to recover.

The next morning, Carter asks Oliver if he has seen the newspaper story about a &quot;Frankenstein monster&quot; on the loose. Oliver scoffs at the story, but when Carter disparages the Frankensteins, Oliver jumps to his feet in their defense. Boyd and Dillon are visited by Mr. Rockwell of Rockwell Labs. Rockwell says the stolen Digenerol may be somehow related to the monster issue.

Back at the home lab, Elsu mistakenly enters through a secret door while Carter and Oliver are working. Oliver shoos him out and to distract Carter knocks the bottle of Digenerol from his hand, spilling every drop. Carter says he must now steal more Digenerol.

Trudy&#x27;s friend Suzie Lawler visits her, and they quarrel. While flouncing off, she makes a date with Oliver. The date goes badly, with Oliver attempting to force himself on Suzie. Since he needs a brain for his creation, he runs Suzie over with his car, killing her. When Elsu asks why he wants to create this creature, Oliver says that &quot;now we&#x27;re aware the female mind is conditioned to a man&#x27;s world. It therefore takes orders, where the other ones didn&#x27;t.&quot;

While Oliver tries to reanimate the monster, Boyd and Dillon arrive. As they tell Oliver that they suspect Carter is the Digenerol thief, &quot;she&quot; comes to life, scarred and unrecognizable. After the police leave, &quot;she&quot; escapes and kills a warehouse worker. Another worker, Mack, calls the cops.

At the house, someone knocks on the front door. Trudy answers. It is the monster. Trudy screams and faints. Elsu coaxes the monster into the lab. When Johnny arrives and tells him what happened, Oliver convinces Johnny that Trudy has an overactive imagination.

Oliver wants the lab for himself and decides to kill Carter. As he starts strangling Carter, Boyle and Dillon show up with more questions about the Digenerol. Oliver tells them Carter stole it; Carter tells them Oliver tried to kill him. Oliver persuades them that Carter is mentally ill, and they arrest Carter. Oliver then argues with Elsu, who refuses any further assistance, and Oliver has the monster kill Elsu. After learning that Carter has been arrested, Johnny leaves for the police station while Trudy stays behind. Oliver reveals his family&#x27;s name and shows her his creation. Trudy faints again, but awakens and goes to the police station, where she learns that Carter has died.

Boyle and Dillon return to the house to further question Oliver. When Boyle leaves, Dillon stays behind to keep an eye on Oliver. Dillon stumbles across the monster&#x27;s hiding place and Oliver orders &quot;her&quot; to kill Dillon.

Trudy and Johnny come home and also find the hideout. Oliver orders &quot;her&quot; to kill them, too. &quot;She&quot; and Johnny fight in the lab. Johnny throws a vial of acid at &quot;her&quot;, but hits Oliver instead, melting his face. As Oliver falls, the monster accidentally sets &quot;herself&quot; alight on a Bunsen burner. Trudy and Johnny flee as &quot;she&quot; is consumed by flames.

==Production==
Layton Films was a company established by Dick Cunha, a filmmaker who had just left Screencraft Productions, and Mark Frederic, an investor. In April 1958 it was announced Layton would make 10 films in just over 24 months for distribution by Astor Films, starting with &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (in the end only two other films were made, &quot;Missile to the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Girl in Room 13&quot;).

&quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was shot during just six days for approximately $65,000 and sold to Astor Pictures for $80,000.

It was filmed at Screencraft Studios in Hollywood, although the house in which much of the action takes place was the home of producer Marc Frederic. Production of the film wrapped in May 1958.

John Ashley had just made a number of films for American International Pictures. He later recalled &quot;AIP was low budget – one hundred grand a movie – but at least they shot on sound stages and the size of the crew was bigger. &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was really rock bottom. But the people were very nice, especially Duck Cunha, the director ... but it was quick, a little more down and dirty than AIP&quot;.

Ashley later said he remembered two things about the film: &quot;the monster, which was a man because the makeup artist didn&#x27;t know it was supposed to be a woman, and that we shot the ending at Harold Lloyd&#x27;s estate, because Harold Lloyd Jr. played a teenager in it&quot;.

Although the credits use the words &quot;and introducing&quot; in reference to Harold Lloyd Jr., his first film role was actually 1953&#x27;s &quot;The Flaming Urge&quot;. Sally Todd was Miss February 1957 in Playboy magazine.

Paul Stanhope and Harry Thomas did the make-up for &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Additional production information can be found on the Tom Weaver-David Schecter-Steve Kronenberg-Larry Blamire audio commentary on Film Detective&#x27;s 2021 &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; Special Edition Blu-ray.

==Release==
===Title===
Film critic Bill Warren notes that &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was titled She Monster of the Night when it was available in 8 mm format and that it &quot;may have been retitled &#x27;The Wild Witch of Frankenstein&#x27; for a Chicago Theater.&quot; Although he does not name the theater or provide a reason for the change in title, he writes that other films were also retitled when they were shown in Chicago at about the same time. British critic Phil Hardy also refers to the film as &quot;&quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; a.k.a. &quot;She Monster of the Night&quot;.&quot;

===Release date===
The film&#x27;s specific U.S. release date is somewhat confusing. The American Film Institute (AFI) simply states that it was released in November 1958, while the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) gives a more precise date of November 15, 1958, for its New York City premiere. However, Warren writes that the release date was &quot;December 15, 1958 (March 4, 1960 in Los Angeles)&quot;.

&quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was released theatrically in Canada and West Germany in 1959, Mexico in 1960, and France in 1962, as well as on unspecified dates in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and the UK. The film was distributed theatrically in Canada by Astral Films; by Sunderfilm Zwicker in West Germany; and by Benelux Films in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. At some point, it played in the UK as the first feature on a double bill with &quot;The Giant Gila Monster&quot;. &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was given an X-certificate by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), restricting its viewing to adults age 16 and over, while &quot;The Giant Gila Monster&quot; got an A-certificate, which meant that the film was considered more suitable for adults than children.

===Clips===
The film has been referred to, had clips from it used, or been shown in its entirety on television numerous times over the years. For example, it was referenced in the &quot;Reluctant Hero&quot; episode of the situation comedy &quot;My Secret Identity&quot; in February 1990. Clips from the film were used in the &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Friends&quot; episode of &quot;100 Years of Horror&quot; in December 1996 and in the &quot;Cinemassacre&#x27;s Monster Madness&quot; episode &quot;Dracula vs. Frankenstein&quot; in October 2010. The entire film was shown on &quot;Frightmare Theater&quot; in May 2017.

&quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; has also been included in at least one theatrical film series. In December 2011, it was shown, along with &quot;Lady Frankenstein&quot;, as part of Michael W. Phillip&#x27;s &quot;Shock Theater&quot; film series, which specialized in showing 16 mm prints of &quot;drive-in movie horror fare&quot;. The series ran on Friday nights at the Wicker Park Arts Center in Chicago.

&quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; has been available in the U.S. for individual home viewing since 2000, when Vintage Video released it on VHS. Both Englewood Entertainment and Image Entertainment released it on DVD. Synergy Entertainment distributed the film worldwide on DVD starting in 2008, and it has been available in France on DVD from Bach Entertainment since 2009; It has been available in Spain on DVD from L&#x27;Atelier since 2009 and in Germany on DVD from Edel Media &amp; Entertainment since 2013.

==Reception==
===Critical===
The reviews written in 1958 and 1959 appear to show that critics did not like &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. According to Warren, the film was &quot;greeted by the few who reviewed it with the contempt it deserved&quot;. He notes that &quot;the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; called the film &#x27;a dismal clunker,&#x27;&quot; while critic &quot;Paul V. Beckley in the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot; felt that it was &#x27;a little better [than &quot;Missile to the Moon&quot;], although much more confusing&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Howard Thompson wrote that &quot;&#x27;it&#x27;s a toss-up whether [&quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; or its co-feature] &quot;Missile to the Moon&quot; is the cheaper, duller piece of claptrap. Both are horror movies, being simply horrible bores&#x27;.&quot; &quot;gross&quot; magazine in its &quot;Review Digest&quot; for the February 9, 1959, issue gave the film a rating of &quot;fair&quot; and recorded a &quot;poor&quot; rating from the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

Modern-day critics generally think poorly of the film. Hardy calls it &quot;a decidedly shoddy teenage monster movie ... weighed down by the usual scenes of teenage partying&quot; and eventually ending with a &quot;routine conflagration when the required running time has been reached&quot;. Also taking note of the &quot;teenage partying&quot; segments of the film, critic Robert Horton writes that the pool-party song-and-dance numbers give viewers a &quot;Z-movie view of Eisenhower America&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; blends early rock movie devices (lover&#x27;s lane, nightclub combo) with an old-school monster story&quot;. But the &quot;Austin (Texas) Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s film critic, Mike Emery, has a more favorable perspective. He calls the film &quot;not bad for an evening of nostalgia and laughs. Not to mention a reminder of an era when fun &#x27;creature features&#x27; were cranked out by the dozen&quot;.

Warren dislikes the monster makeup worn by Harry Wilson and the gender confusion that results from a man playing Frankenstein&#x27;s daughter. He writes that &quot;it&#x27;s never clear if the monster is entirely a female – it certainly doesn&#x27;t look like a woman – or has the body of a man and the head of a woman ... we never know if the monster is male, female, or a mixture – or why that would make any difference&quot;. He blames much of this on the monster makeup, writing that &quot;when he learned at the last moment the monster was supposed to be a woman, [makeup artist Harry] Thomas hastily scrawled lipstick on its mouth and sent it on to movie immortality&quot;. In an interview, Cuhna laid the blame for the makeup not on Harry Thomas, but on a short shooting schedule and low budget, telling crtitc Tom Weaver that &quot;it was a situation where we just got trapped, again, without any money. We had no preparation time, and &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was designed on the set on the first day of shooting ... we just didn&#x27;t have enough money to create a monster that would represent Sally Todd. Thomas told Weaver in a separate interview that he &quot;wanted to make Sally Todd up as the monster, but the producers didn&#x27;t think she was big enough to fight and look menacing&quot;.

Critic Bryan Senn says that &quot;though there&#x27;s much to scoff at in this gender-bending cheapie, director Cuhna and cinematographer Meredith Nicholson at least &quot;try&quot; to invest the proceedings with some visual interest, utilizing shadows, depth of field, and even change of focus within a shot to bring a character into sharp relief at a dramatic moment&quot;. Those attempts do not sound entirely successful, though. Hardy writes that Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;shadowy lighting, however, can&#x27;t fully disguise the few cramped studio sets and banal exteriors ... and so the picture possesses a cheap, claustrophobic feel&quot;.

The acting has drawn mixed reviews. While Emery writes that the film is &quot;filled with awful acting and even worse rock &amp; roll dance numbers&quot;, when it comes to a major character, &quot;Dr. Frankenstein was never slimier than when he was portrayed by Donald Murphy&quot;. He describes Oliver as &quot;part mad scientist, part Ivy League jerk&quot; and says that he is &quot;one of the more lecherous and humorous characters to bear the legendary doctor&#x27;s name&quot;. Senn is also favorable toward Murphy&#x27;s acting, writing that he &quot;gives a hearty performance as the arrogant, brilliant Oliver. He imbues his scornful scientist with a superior air and a wealth of passion&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;hero John Ashley&#x27;s toneless playing adds to the production&#x27;s woes. His deadpan delivery and immobile countenance are so stiff you could light a match on them&quot;.

&quot;Diabolique&quot; magazine wrote that Ashley &quot;gives a solid leading man performance... it&#x27;s not particularly memorable work but is grounded and realistic, and serves as a useful counter-balance to the extreme nature of the story.&quot;

The director said the film was his &quot;biggest disappointment ... because of our monster creator; I can&#x27;t blame anyone for that, we just didn&#x27;t have enough money to create a monster that would represent Sally Todd&quot;.

Currently, the film has a 3.8/10 rating on the Internet Movie Database, with 647 ratings, 36 user reviews and 12 external reviews. At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, there are no ratings from professional critics and only 14 reviews from the general audience. 20 percent of the audience says it likes &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and gives the film an average rating of 2.5/5, based on 315 viewers.

==Music==
Page Cavanaugh and His Trio performed the song &quot;Special Date&quot; on-screen during the film and with Harold Lloyd Jr. providing the vocals, a second song, titled &quot;Daddy Bird&quot;. The latter was released in 1958 by Surf Records as the A-side of a 45-rpm single, with &quot;Grind Me a Pound&quot; on the B-side. Lloyd is credited on the record as Duke Lloyd. A CD of instrumental music from the soundtracks of &quot;Missile to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, simply titled &quot;MIssile to the Moon/Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, was released in October 2012 by Monstrous Movie Music. The &quot;marvelous-but-unheralded composer and orchestrator, Nicholas Carras&quot; scored each film in 1958 for between $9000 and $10,000.

<doc id="640647" wikidata="Q1111267" url="?curid=640647" title="Democratic Socialist Party (Japan)">
<text>The was a political party in Japan from 1960 to 1994.

== History ==
The party was established in January 1960 by a breakaway faction of the Japanese Socialist Party. Led by Suehiro Nishio, it was made up of members of the most moderate wing of the former Rightist Socialist Party of Japan, a moderate faction that had existed as an independent party between 1948 and 1955 before reluctantly merging back together with the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan. Although long-standing ideological differences and factional rivalries played a key role, the proximate cause of the split was internal disagreements over how to conduct the ongoing Anpo protests against revision of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan, known as Anpo in Japanese, and whether or not to cooperate with the Communist Party of Japan in doing so.

Declassified United States government documents later revealed that covert CIA funding had also helped encourage the founding of this breakaway party. CIA support was aimed at moderating and subverting the political opposition to the ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party, which was the main CIA funded party.

The DSP was dissolved in 1994 to join the New Frontier Party. In 1996, the Japan Socialist Party was transformed into the Social Democratic Party. Two years later, in 1998, the New Frontier Party dissolved and most former DSP members eventually joined the Democratic Party of Japan. Despite the dissolution of the DSP in 1994, its youth organisation (Minsha Youth) survived until 2003 and was a member of the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY). After Minsha Youth was dissolved, some of its former members and independent social democrats formed Young Socialists, a new youth organisation which retained full membership in IUSY; however, it was finally dissolved on 8 March 2008 without any successor organisation and abandoned its IUSY membership.

The tradition of the DSP is carried on by the Minsha kyōkai (民社協会, Democratic Socialist Group) as a faction within the liberal Democratic Party of Japan, Democratic Party and now centre-right Democratic Party for the People.

== Political position and foreign policy ==
The DSP was rated &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;moderate social-democratic&quot;, &quot;centrist&quot; and &quot;centre-left&quot; by Japanese political standards at the time, but at the same time it was also regarded as a &quot;conservative&quot; political party. It derived much of its financial and organisational support from the Domei private-sector labour confederation, but unlike other social-democratic political parties in Japan, the party was not hostile to accepting neoliberal policies Due to the DSP&#x27;s syncretic political position, the party&#x27;s ideology is often referred to as right-wing social democracy (右派社会民主主義).

The DSP strongly backed the Japan–United States alliance. For this reason, the DSP was often called the &quot;right-wing party&quot; in Japan, but because the DSP had a belief in socialist ideals, it was classified as a political &quot;centrist&quot; along with the old Komeito at the time. In addition, the DSP was a member of left-wing Socialist International.

<doc id="640649" wikidata="Q4743404" url="?curid=640649" title="American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft">
<text>American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft (filed April 9, 2004 in the United States) is a lawsuit filed on behalf of a formerly unknown Internet Service Provider (ISP) company under the pseudonym John Doe, Inc. by the American Civil Liberties Union against the U.S. federal government, by the Department of Justice under former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. 

In 2010, it was revealed that John Doe was in fact Nicholas Merrill of Calyx Internet Access. Merrill was subject to National Security Letters (NSLs) from the Federal Bureau of Investigation requiring the release of private information and under a gag order forbidding any public discussion of the issues. In September 2004, Judge Victor Marrero of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York struck down the NSL provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. This prompted Congress to amend the law to allow limited judicial review of NSLs, and prompted the government to appeal the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeal was dismissed by &quot;Doe I v. Gonzales&quot;, 449 F.3d 415 (2d Cir. 2006) because Congress amended Section 2709 in the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005.

On the recommendation of the Second Circuit, the district court considered the amended law in 2007, in &quot;Doe v. Gonzales&quot;. On September 6, 2007, Judge Marrero struck down the NSL provision of the revised Act, ruling that even with limited judicial review granted in the amended law, it was still a violation of separation of powers under the United States Constitution and the First Amendment. This is not yet enforced, pending a possible government appeal.

== Challenge of the lawsuit and arguments ==

Because of the secrecy rules involved, the government would not let the ACLU disclose they had even filed a case for nearly a month, after which they were permitted to release a heavily redacted version of the complaint (shown right). According to government secrecy rules (the National Security Letter provision, [Section 2709] of the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act, [ECPA]) the ACLU still could not disclose which ISP was served with the request to produce documents.

This prompted the ACLU to challenge the secrecy law itself, and they sued to invalidate the NSL provision of the ECPA. Introduced by U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and enacted in 1986, the bill permitted the FBI to obtain customer records from telephone and Internet companies in terrorism investigations.

The ACLU argued that the NSL violated the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution because
* Section 2709 failed to spell out any legal process whereby a telephone or Internet company could try to oppose an NSL subpoena in court and
* Section 2709 prohibited the recipient of an NSL subpoena from disclosing that he had received such a request from the FBI, and outweighs the FBI&#x27;s need for secrecy in counter-terrorism investigations.

The government agreed in principle with the ACLU&#x27;s claim that the recipient of the subpoena can challenge it in court, and because the matter of specified judicial process remained in question and directly affected other present and future cases, the Court found the NSL section to be in need of review.

== Court finding ==

The Court subsequently found section 2709 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act unconstitutional. It reasoned that it could not find in the provision an implied right for the person receiving the subpoena to challenge it in court as is constitutionally required.

The finding of unconstitutionality essentially dismisses any claimed presumptive legal need for absolute secrecy in regard to terrorism cases. The USA PATRIOT Act is affected only if the limits on NSLs in terrorism cases also apply to non-terrorism cases such as those authorized by the Act.
The government was expected to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, and until the district court ruling is reviewed, the secrecy procedures of the NSL remain in place.

== 2010 – Partial lift of gag order ==
On August 10, 2010, after 6 years Nicholas Merrill was partially released from his gag order and allowed to reveal his identity, although he could not reveal what information the FBI sought from him. This was 3 years after Merrill won a &#x27;liberty award&#x27; from the ACLU, which had to present the award to an empty chair at the time. Merrill has since founded the nonprofit Calyx Institute to provide education and research on privacy issues.

== 2015 – Full lift of gag order ==
On September 14, 2015, 11 years after the initial NSL, a federal district court judge in New York fully lifted the gag order, allowing Merrill to speak freely about the contents of the NSL he received. The court order went into effect 90 days after the initial ruling, to allow the government time to appeal the decision if it wished.

<doc id="640651" wikidata="Q1168595" url="?curid=640651" title="Blood from the Mummy's Tomb">
<text>Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb is a 1971 British horror film starring Andrew Keir, Valerie Leon and James Villiers. It was director Seth Holt&#x27;s final film, and was loosely adapted by Christopher Wicking from Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1903 novel &quot;The Jewel of Seven Stars&quot;. The film was released as the support feature to &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde&quot;.

Besides providing a rare leading role for Valerie Leon, the film is notable for its troubled production. It has also been called one of Hammer&#x27;s best films of the 1970s.

==Plot==
An expedition led by Professor Fuchs locates the unmarked tomb of Tera an evil Egyptian queen. A cabal of priests drugged her into a state of suspended animation and buried all of her evil relics with her. Fuchs is obsessed with Tera and takes her mummy and sarcophagus back to England, where he secretly recreates her tomb under his house. Four days &quot;before her birthday&quot;, his daughter Margaret – who bears an uncanny resemblance to Tera and was born at the instant they recited her name - has recurring nightmares. Fuchs gives her the old queen&#x27;s ring and tells her to &quot;wear it always&quot;. Of course, this only makes matters worse. Queen Tera&#x27;s evil power begins to tempt Margaret, as she learns how she&#x27;s feared by her father&#x27;s former colleagues.

Margaret notices a man lurking in the vacant building across the street. He is Corbeck, an expedition member who&#x27;s now her father&#x27;s rival. Corbeck wants to restore Tera to life and he persuades Margaret to help him gather the missing relics. The problem is, each time one is given up the person who&#x27;d held it dies. When they have all the relics, Corbeck, Margaret and Fuchs begin the ancient ritual to reawaken Tera. At the last moment Fuchs learns that the queen&#x27;s revival will mean Margaret&#x27;s death. Together Fuchs and Margaret overpower and kill Corbeck, as the house quakes above them. Queen Tera awakens and kills Fuchs, but not before Margaret stabs her. Margaret and Tera are grappling over an ancient dagger when the house finally collapses on them.

Later in the hospital, a woman&#x27;s face is wrapped in bandages. She&#x27;s the sole survivor, and that all the others in the Professor&#x27;s basement were &quot;crushed beyond recognition&quot;. The bandaged woman slowly opens her eyes and struggles to speak, leaving the film scene ambiguous as to whether she is Margaret Fuchs or Queen Tera.

==Production==
===Development===
Writer Chris Wicking said the film was one of the last projects that James Carreras brought to Hammer. Wicking wanted to use the title of the book but Carreras did not. They brainstormed titles and came up with &quot;Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, which Wicking thought they would never use, but they did.

Finance came from EMI Films.

The job of directing went to Seth Holt, whose films were admired by producer Howard Brandy. Holt had a strong critical reputation for making such films as &quot;The Nanny&quot;, but had not made a movie in two years. As Holt said in 1971: &quot;I haven&#x27;t been directing because I haven&#x27;t been offered anything to direct&quot;.

Wicking worked with Seth Holt on the script. The film had to go into production early because there was a gap in the production schedule. Wicking said he had a falling out with producer Howard Brandy and was barred from the set but he continued to work with Holt in the evenings.

Brandy later claimed Wicking&#x27;s script was &quot;unshootable&quot; and that Holt constantly rewrote it. He also says he and Holt wanted to cast Amy Grant in the lead but Sir James Carreras insisted on Valerie Leon.

===Shooting===
Peter Cushing was cast in the film and completed one day&#x27;s filming before leaving the production after his wife was diagnosed with emphysema. Cushing was replaced by Andrew Keir. The R1 DVD of the film released in the United States by Anchor Bay Entertainment contains still photographs of Cushing&#x27;s day on the production.

Director Seth Holt died of a heart attack five weeks into the six-week shoot, collapsing into cast member Aubrey Morris&#x27;s arms and dying on set. Michael Carreras asked Don Sharp to take over but the director was unable to as he had signed to direct a film in Israel for the producer of &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot; (this film was ultimately not made).

Michael Carreras directed the final week&#x27;s filming. He said Holt&#x27;s footage did not cut together.

According to the book &quot;Hammer, House of Horror: Behind the Screams&quot; by Howard Maxford, the budget for the film was £200,000. The film was shot at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire.

==Release==
In January 1972, AIP bought the US distribution rights.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Seth Holt died while shooting &quot;Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot;; the final week&#x27;s work was directed by Michael Carreras, who obviously made every effort to adopt Holt&#x27;s visual style. Holt, however, was apparently revising his script day-by-day, and the stylistic consistency of the completed film cannot mask a number of unresolved themes and ideas. For all that, &quot;Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; is Holt&#x27;s most distinctive work, and effortlessly the best of Hammer&#x27;s recent attempts to &#x27;develop&#x27; the classic horror themes. The explanatory background that conventionally emerges in a few garbled words during or after the climax in horror movies, here becomes the substance of the whole first half of the film: a mythic, amoral deity is built up, and an entire attendant cosmogony suggested, through astrological references and other choice details. After this, the main drama of the film centres on the debate between Fuchs and Corbeck on the morality of releasing power like Tera&#x27;s in a world like ours. &#x27;Our world&#x27; is in turn the subject of Holt&#x27;s most characteristically jaundiced view. A surface of perversity and fear barely contains undergrowths of madness, chaos and destruction. Several of the film&#x27;s scenes occur in a lunatic asylum (where George Coulouris is victim to two of the most gleefully sadistic warders since &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;); other characters are frequently seen alone in moments of private mania. The young hero (name of Tod Browning, so that you know he&#x27;s all right) is killed before he has a chance to do anything effectual. And in a breathtaking reversal, Holt saves his all-too-human &#x27;mummy&#x27; for his final shot: where she is Margaret, swathed in hospital bandages after the catastrophe. It&#x27;s all as if Holt had superimposed the psychological-suspense methods of his thrillers on to the Gothic mechanics of the genre; the result (as in the work of all true pioneers) makes the genre seem like new.&quot;

AllMovie&#x27;s review of the film was favourable, commending its &quot;glamorous style&quot; and &quot;creepy atmosphere&quot;.

&quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave it three out of five.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;tremendous fun, skilful and wonderfully energetic&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;polished and well-acted but rather tame&quot;.

==Legacy==
According to &quot;Filmink&quot; &quot;over time, a devoted cult has grown around&quot; the film, &quot;partly due to the sexiness of Seth Holt’s death, but also the qualities of the film. There is a magic about &quot;Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb&quot;, at least to its fans. It’s not completely well realised, but there is so much to admire: the professionalism of Andrew Keir, the splendid villainy of James Villiers and James Cossins (who plays a sadistic nurse), the bewitching Valerie Leon (who genuinely seems like she stepped out of the Ancient past), Tristram Carey’s superbly eerie musical score, Scott MacGregor’s enjoyable production design.&quot;

<doc id="640655" wikidata="Q1140205" url="?curid=640655" title="IT disaster recovery">
<text>IT disaster recovery (also, simply disaster recovery (DR)) is the process of maintaining or reestablishing vital infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster, such as a storm or battle. DR employs policies, tools, and procedures with a focus on IT systems supporting critical business functions. This involves keeping all essential aspects of a business functioning despite significant disruptive events; it can therefore be considered a subset of business continuity (BC). DR assumes that the primary site is not immediately recoverable and restores data and services to a secondary site.

==IT service continuity==

IT service continuity (ITSC) is a subset of BCP, which relies on the metrics (frequently used as key risk indicators) of recovery point/time objectives. It encompasses IT disaster recovery planning and the wider IT resilience planning. It also incorporates IT infrastructure and services related to communications, such as telephony and data communications.

===Principles of backup sites===

Planning includes arranging for backup sites, whether they are &quot;hot&quot; (operating prior to a disaster), &quot;warm&quot; (ready to begin operating), or &quot;cold&quot; (requires substantial work to begin operating), and standby sites with hardware as needed for continuity.

In 2008, the British Standards Institution launched a specific standard supporting Business Continuity Standard BS 25999, titled BS25777, specifically to align computer continuity with business continuity. This was withdrawn following the publication in March 2011 of ISO/IEC 27301, &quot;Security techniques — Guidelines for information and communication technology readiness for business continuity.&quot;

ITIL has defined some of these terms.

===Recovery Time Objective===
The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the targeted duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be restored after a disruption in order to avoid a break in business continuity.

According to business continuity planning methodology, the RTO is established during the business impact analysis (BIA) by the owner(s) of the process, including identifying time frames for alternate or manual workarounds.

RTO is a complement of RPO. The limits of acceptable or &quot;tolerable&quot; ITSC performance are measured by RTO and RPO in terms of time lost from normal business process functioning and data lost or not backed up during that period.

====Recovery Time Actual====
Recovery Time Actual (RTA) is the critical metric for business continuity and disaster recovery.

The business continuity group conducts timed rehearsals (or actuals), during which RTA gets determined and refined as needed.

=== Recovery Point Objective ===
A Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum acceptable interval during which transactional data is lost from an IT service.

For example, if RPO is measured in minutes, then in practice, off-site mirrored backups must be continuously maintained as a daily off-site backup will not suffice.

====Relationship to RTO====
A recovery that is not instantaneous restores transactional data over some interval without incurring significant risks or losses.

RPO measures the maximum time in which recent data might have been permanently lost and not a direct measure of loss quantity. For instance, if the BC plan is to restore up to the last available backup, then the RPO is the interval between such backups.

RPO is not determined by the existing backup regime. Instead BIA determines RPO for each service. When off-site data is required, the period during which data might be lost may start when backups are prepared, not when the backups are secured off-site.

===Mean times===
The recovery metrics can be converted to/used alongside failure metrics. Common measurements include mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to first failure (MTFF), mean time to repair (MTTR), and mean down time (MDT).

===Data synchronization points===
A data synchronization point is a backup is completed. It halts update processing while a disk-to-disk copy is completed. The backup copy reflects the earlier version of the copy operation; not when the data is copied to tape or transmitted elsewhere.

===System design===
RTO and the RPO must be balanced, taking business risk into account, along with other system design criteria.

RPO is tied to the times backups are secured offsite. Sending synchronous copies to an offsite mirror allows for most unforeseen events. The use of physical transportation for tapes (or other transportable media) is common. Recovery can be activated at a predetermined site. Shared offsite space and hardware complete the package.

For high volumes of high-value transaction data, hardware can be split across multiple sites.

==History==
Planning for disaster recovery and information technology (IT) developed in the mid to late 1970s as computer center managers began to recognize the dependence of their organizations on their computer systems.

At that time, most systems were batch-oriented mainframes. An offsite mainframe could be loaded from backup tapes pending recovery of the primary site; downtime was relatively less critical.

The disaster recovery industry developed to provide backup computer centers. Sungard Availability Services was one of the earliest such centers, located in Sri Lanka (1978).

During the 1980s and 90s, computing grew exponentially, including internal corporate timesharing, online data entry and real-time processing. Availability of IT systems became more important.

Regulatory agencies became involved; availability objectives of 2, 3, 4 or 5 nines (99.999%) were often mandated, and high-availability solutions for hot-site facilities were sought.

IT service continuity became essential as part of Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Information Security Management (ICM) as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 22301 respectively.

The rise of cloud computing since 2010 created new opportunities for system resiliency. Service providers absorbed the responsibility for maintaining high service levels, including availability and reliability. They offered highly resilient network designs. Recovery as a Service (RaaS) is widely available and promoted by the Cloud Security Alliance.

==Classification ==
Disasters can be the result of three broad categories of threats and hazards.

* Natural hazards include acts of nature such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and epidemics. 
* Technological hazards include accidents or the failures of systems and structures such as pipeline explosions, transportation accidents, utility disruptions, dam failures, and accidental hazardous material releases. 
* Human-caused threats that include intentional acts such as active assailant attacks, chemical or biological attacks, cyber attacks against data or infrastructure, sabotage, and war.

Preparedness measures for all categories and types of disasters fall into the five mission areas of prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery.

==Planning==
Research supports the idea that implementing a more holistic pre-disaster planning approach is more cost-effective. Every $1 spent on hazard mitigation (such as a disaster recovery plan) saves society $4 in response and recovery costs.

2015 disaster recovery statistics suggest that downtime lasting for one hour can cost 
* small companies $8,000,
* mid-size organizations $74,000, and
* large enterprises $700,000 or more.

As IT systems have become increasingly critical to the smooth operation of a company, and arguably the economy as a whole, the importance of ensuring the continued operation of those systems, and their rapid recovery, has increased.

==Control measures==
Control measures are steps or mechanisms that can reduce or eliminate threats. The choice of mechanisms is reflected in a disaster recovery plan (DRP).

Control measures can be classified as controls aimed at preventing an event from occurring, controls aimed at detecting or discovering unwanted events, and controls aimed at correcting or restoring the system after a disaster or an event.

These controls are documented and exercised regularly using so-called &quot;DR tests&quot;.

== Strategies ==
The disaster recovery strategy derives from the business continuity plan. Metrics for business processes are then mapped to systems and infrastructure. A cost-benefit analysis highlights which disaster recovery measures are appropriate. Different strategies make sense based on the cost of downtime compared to the cost of implementing a particular strategy.

Common strategies include:
* backups to tape and sent off-site 
* backups to disk on-site (copied to off-site disk) or off-site
* replication off-site, such that once the systems are restored or synchronized, possibly via storage area network technology
* private cloud solutions that replicate metadata (VMs, templates and disks) into the private cloud. Metadata are configured as an XML representation called Open Virtualization Format, and can be easily restored
* hybrid cloud solutions that replicate both on-site and to off-site data centers. This provides instant fail-over to on-site hardware or to cloud data centers.
* high availability systems which keep both the data and system replicated off-site, enabling continuous access to systems and data, even after a disaster (often associated with cloud storage).

Precautionary strategies may include:
* local mirrors of systems and/or data and use of disk protection technology such as RAID
* surge protectors — to minimize the effect of power surges on delicate electronic equipment
* use of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and/or backup generator to keep systems going in the event of a power failure
* fire prevention/mitigation systems such as alarms and fire extinguishers
* anti-virus software and other security measures.

== Disaster recovery as a service ==

Disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) is an arrangement with a third party vendor to perform some or all DR functions for scenarios such as power outages, equipment failures, cyber attacks, and natural disasters.

== Disaster recovery for cloud systems ==
Following best practices can enhance disaster recovery strategy for cloud-hosted systems: 

# Flexibility: The disaster recovery strategy should be adaptable to support both partial failures (such as recovering specific files) and full environment failures.
# Regular testing: Regular testing of the disaster recovery plan can verify its effectiveness and identify any weaknesses or gaps. 
# Clear roles and permissions: It should be clearly defined who is authorized to execute the disaster recovery plan, with separate access and permissions for these individuals. Implementing a clear separation of permissions between those who can execute the recovery and those who have access to backup data helps minimize the risk of unauthorized actions.
# Documentation: The plan should be well-documented and easy-to-follow to ensure that operators can effectively follow it during stressful situations.

<doc id="640657" wikidata="Q2165663" url="?curid=640657" title="Chronic granulomatous disease">
<text>Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), also known as Bridges–Good syndrome, chronic granulomatous disorder, and Quie syndrome, is a diverse group of hereditary diseases in which certain cells of the immune system have difficulty forming the reactive oxygen compounds (most importantly the superoxide radical due to defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase) used to kill certain ingested pathogens. This leads to the formation of granulomas in many organs. CGD affects about 1 in 200,000 people in the United States, with about 20 new cases diagnosed each year.

This condition was first discovered in 1950 in a series of four boys from Minnesota, and in 1957 it was named &quot;a fatal granulomatosus of childhood&quot; in a publication describing their disease. The underlying cellular mechanism that causes chronic granulomatous disease was discovered in 1967, and research since that time has further elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Bernard Babior made key contributions in linking the defect of superoxide production of white blood cells, to the cause of the disease. In 1986, the X-linked form of CGD was the first disease for which positional cloning was used to identify the underlying genetic mutation.

==Symptoms and signs==
Classically, patients with chronic granulomatous disease will have recurrent bouts of infection due to the decreased capacity of their immune system to fight off disease-causing organisms. The recurrent infections they acquire are specific and are, in decreasing order of frequency:
* pneumonia
* abscesses of the skin, tissues, and organs
* septic arthritis
* osteomyelitis
* bacteremia/fungemia
* superficial skin infections such as cellulitis or impetigo

Most people with CGD are diagnosed in childhood, usually, before age 5. Early diagnosis is important since these people can be placed on antibiotics to ward off infections before they occur. Small groups of CGD patients may also be affected by McLeod syndrome because of the proximity of the two genes on the same X-chromosome.

===Atypical infections===

People with CGD are sometimes infected with organisms that usually do not cause disease in people with normal immune systems. Among the most common organisms that cause disease in CGD patients are:
* Bacteria (particularly those that are catalase-positive)
** &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.
** &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;.
** &quot;Listeria&quot; species.

Patients with CGD can usually resist infections of catalase-negative bacteria but are susceptible to catalase-positive bacteria. Catalase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide in many organisms. In infections caused by organisms that lack catalase (catalase-negative), the host with CGD is successfully able to &quot;borrow&quot; hydrogen peroxide being made by the organism and use it to fight off the infection. In infections by organisms that have catalase (catalase-positive), this &quot;borrowing mechanism&quot; is unsuccessful because the enzyme catalase first breaks down any hydrogen peroxide that would be borrowed from the organism. Therefore in the CGD patient, hydrogen peroxide cannot be used to make oxygen radicals to fight infection, leaving the patient vulnerable to infection by catalase-positive bacteria.

== Genetics ==
Most cases of chronic granulomatous disease are transmitted as a mutation on the X chromosome and are thus called an &quot;X-linked trait&quot;. The affected gene on the X chromosome codes for the gp91 protein p91-PHOX (&quot;91&quot; is the weight of the protein in kDa; the &quot;gp&quot; means glycoprotein). CGD can also be transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion (via CYBA, NCF1, NCF2 and NCF4) which affect other PHOX proteins. The type of mutation that causes both types of CGD are varied and may be deletions, frame-shift, nonsense, and missense.

A low level of NADPH, the cofactor required for superoxide synthesis, can lead to CGD. This has been reported in women who are homozygous for the genetic defect causing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), which is characterised by reduced NADPH levels.

== Pathophysiology ==

Phagocytes (i.e. neutrophils and macrophages) require an enzyme to produce reactive oxygen species to destroy bacteria after they are ingested (phagocytosis), a process known as the respiratory burst. This enzyme is termed &quot;phagocyte NADPH oxidase&quot; (&quot;PHOX&quot;). This enzyme oxidizes NADPH and reduces molecular oxygen to produce superoxide anions, a reactive oxygen species. Superoxide is then disproportionated into peroxide and molecular oxygen by superoxide dismutase. Finally, peroxide is used by myeloperoxidase to oxidize chloride ions into hypochlorite (the active component of bleach), which is toxic to bacteria. Thus, NADPH oxidase is critical for phagocyte killing of bacteria through reactive oxygen species.

(Two other mechanisms are used by phagocytes to kill bacteria: nitric oxide and proteases, but the loss of ROS-mediated killing alone is sufficient to cause chronic granulomatous disease.)

Defects in one of the four essential subunits of phagocyte NADPH oxidase (PHOX) can all cause CGD of varying severity, dependent on the defect. There are over 410 known possible defects in the PHOX enzyme complex that can lead to chronic granulomatous disease.

==Diagnosis==
When chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is suspected, neutrophil-function testing should be carried out, and positive findings should be confirmed by genotyping. The p47phox mutation is due to a pseudogene conversion, hence it may not be detectable by standard sequencing; in these cases, an immunoblot or gene dose determination may be needed to confirm p47phox deficiency.

Infections caused by the pathogens commonly associated with CGD should prompt functional or genetic screening; neonatal or early postnatal screening of potentially affected children is essential with a family history of CGD.

Neutrophil function tests: These include nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test, dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 test, direct measurement of superoxide production, cytochrome c reduction assay, and chemiluminescence. DHR test is usually preferred because it is easy to use, objective, and it is able to distinguish between X-linked and autosomal forms of CGD; furthermore, it allows to detect gp91phox carriers.
* The nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) test is the original and most widely known test for chronic granulomatous disease. It is negative in CGD, meaning that it does not turn blue. The higher the blue score, the better the cell is at producing reactive oxygen species. This test depends upon the direct reduction of NBT to the insoluble blue compound formazan by superoxide which is produced by normal peripheral blood neutrophils stimulated in vitro; NADPH oxidase catalyzes the aforementioned reaction and NADPH is oxidized in the same reaction. This test is simple to perform and gives rapid results but only tells whether or not there is a problem with the PHOX enzymes, not how much they are affected.
* Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 test: In this test the respiratory burst of the neutrophils is stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), resulting in oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 (nonfluorescent derivative of rhodamine) to rhodamine 123 (green fluorescent compound), which can be measured by flow cytometry. This test is abnormal in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (i.e., there is no shift in fluorescence with stimulation). Moreover, its quantitative nature allows to differentiate oxidase-positive from oxidase-negative phagocyte subpopulations in CGD carriers and identify deficiencies in gp91phox and p47phox. Modest residual production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) as assessed by DHR 123 test, is associated with significantly less severe illness and a greater likelihood of long-term survival than patients with little residual ROI production. On the other hand, in the case of complete myeloperoxidase deficiency, DHR test gives abnormal results (false positive for CGD) because the DHR signal yielded by flow cytometry depends on intact NADPH oxidase activity as well as the presence of a myeloperoxidase (MPO); however, NBT test demonstrates normal production of superoxide.

Genetic testing: Once CGD has been diagnosed based on abnormal neutrophil function tests, genetic testing should go next. As mentioned above, p47phox defect is usually difficult to identify genetically because it is caused by pseudogene conversion and may be missed in typical sequencing studies; in this case, immunoblotting or flow cytometry can show absence of protein.

Prenatal testing: It is particularly useful when a family member has already been diagnosed with CGD. This test may be performed by analysis of NADPH oxidase activity of neutrophils from fetal blood. Samples from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi provides an earlier and more reliable diagnosis for families at risk.

===Classification===
Chronic granulomatous disease is the name for a genetically heterogeneous group of immunodeficiencies. The core defect is a failure of phagocytic cells to kill organisms that they have engulfed because of defects in a system of enzymes that produce free radicals and other toxic small molecules. There are several types, including:
* X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)
* autosomal recessive cytochrome b-negative CGD
* autosomal recessive cytochrome b-positive CGD type I
* autosomal recessive cytochrome b-positive CGD type II
* atypical granulomatous disease

==Treatment==
Management of chronic granulomatous disease revolves around two goals: 1) diagnose the disease early so that antibiotic prophylaxis can be given to keep an infection from occurring, and 2) educate the patient about his or her condition so that prompt treatment can be given if an infection occurs.

===Antibiotics===
Physicians often prescribe the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent bacterial infections. This drug also has the benefit of sparing the normal bacteria of the digestive tract. Fungal infection is commonly prevented with itraconazole, although a newer drug of the same type called voriconazole may be more effective. The use of this drug for this purpose is still under scientific investigation.

===Immunomodulation===
Interferon, in the form of interferon gamma-1b (Actimmune) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of infection in CGD. It has been shown to reduce infections in CGD patients by 70% and to decrease their severity. Although its exact mechanism is still not entirely understood, it has the ability to give CGD patients more immune function and therefore, greater ability to fight off infections. This therapy has been the standard treatment for CGD for several years.

===Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)===
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched donor is curative although not without significant risk.

==Prognosis==
There are currently no studies detailing the long term outcome of chronic granulomatous disease with modern treatment. Without treatment, children often die in the first decade of life. The increased severity of X-linked CGD results in a decreased survival rate of patients, as 20% of X-linked patients die of CGD-related causes by the age of 10, whereas 20% of autosomal recessive patients die by the age of 35.&lt;br&gt;Recent experience from centers specializing in the care of patients with CGD suggests that the current mortality has fallen to under 3% and 1% respectively.
CGD was initially termed &quot;fatal granulomatous disease of childhood&quot; because patients rarely survived past their first decade in the time before routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents. The average patient now survives at least 40 years.

==Epidemiology==
CGD affects about 1 in 200,000 people in the United States, with about 20 new cases diagnosed each year.

Chronic granulomatous disease affects all people of all races; however, there is limited information on prevalence outside of the United States. One survey in Sweden reported an incidence of 1 in 220,000 people, while a larger review of studies in Europe suggested a lower rate: 1 in 250,000 people.

==History==

This condition was first described in 1954 by Janeway, who reported five cases of the disease in children. In 1957 it was further characterized as &quot;a fatal granulomatosus of childhood&quot;. The underlying cellular mechanism that causes chronic granulomatous disease was discovered in 1967, and research since that time has further elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Use of antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical abscess drainage, and vaccination led to the term &quot;fatal&quot; being dropped from the name of the disease as children survived into adulthood.

==Research==
Gene therapy is currently being studied as a possible treatment for chronic granulomatous disease. CGD is well-suited for gene therapy since it is caused by a mutation in single gene which only affects one body system (the hematopoietic system). Viruses have been used to deliver a normal gp91 gene to rats with a mutation in this gene, and subsequently the phagocytes in these rats were able to produce oxygen radicals.

In 2006, two human patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease underwent gene therapy and blood cell precursor stem cell transplantation to their bone marrow. Both patients recovered from their CGD, clearing pre-existing infections and demonstrating increased oxidase activity in their neutrophils. However, long-term complications and efficacy of this therapy were unknown.

In 2012, a 16-year-old boy with CGD was treated at the Great Ormond Street Hospital, London with an experimental gene therapy that temporarily reversed the CGD and allowed him to overcome a life-threatening lung disease.

<doc id="640658" wikidata="Q611891" url="?curid=640658" title="Archie Manning">
<text>Elisha Archibald Manning III (born May 19, 1949) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons, primarily with the New Orleans Saints from 1971 to 1982. He also had brief stints with the Houston Oilers and the Minnesota Vikings. He played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989. Manning is the patriarch of the Manning football dynasty, having preceded sons Peyton and Eli as a successful NFL quarterback.

==Early life==
Born in Drew, Mississippi, Manning is the son of Jane Elizabeth (née Nelson) and Elisha Archibald Manning Jr. He grew up heavily involved in football, basketball, baseball, and track. His father, known as &quot;Buddy&quot;, was interested in Archie&#x27;s sports activities, but the nature of his job left him little if any time for attending games. Instead, Archie III drew his inspiration from a local high school sports star, James Hobson. His mother was &quot;a ubiquitous presence at all of his games, no matter what the sport or level.&quot; Manning attended Drew High School. Manning was selected in the Major League Baseball draft four times, first in 1967 by the Braves, twice by the White Sox, and finally by the Royals in 1971. In the summer of 1969, his father Buddy Manning, facing financial struggles and having suffered a stroke, died by suicide. Archie, who was home from college for summer vacation, was the first to discover Buddy&#x27;s body. In the biopic-documentary &quot;Book of Manning&quot;, Manning said that he considered dropping out and getting a job to support his mother and sister, but his mother persuaded him to return to college and not put his rising football career to waste.

==College career==
Manning attended the University of Mississippi in Oxford and was the starting quarterback at Ole Miss for three years under legendary head coach Johnny Vaught. In one of the first national prime time broadcasts of a college football game (on ABC, October 4, 1969), Manning threw for 436 yards and three touchdowns, also rushing for 104 yards, in a 33–32 loss to Alabama. His performance set Southeastern Conference (SEC) records for passing yards, completions and total offense, with the total offense record standing for 43 years before being broken by Johnny Manziel in 2012.

During Manning&#x27;s last two seasons at Ole Miss, the Rebels had a record of 15–7. In his college career, he threw 4,753 yards and 31 touchdowns (despite 40 interceptions) and ran for 823 yards. He scored 14 touchdowns in 1969. In both 1969 and 1970, he was named to the All-SEC team and his No. 18 jersey was retired by Ole Miss. In 1969, Manning was Mississippi Sportsman of the Year and recipient of the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; Trophy as Most Valuable Player in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in addition to winning the Walter Camp Memorial Trophy. He was fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1969 and third in 1970. He was also inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa in 1970 at Mississippi.

Manning was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989. Manning&#x27;s legacy is honored on the Ole Miss campus, where the speed limit is 18 miles per hour in honor of Manning&#x27;s jersey number. During his time at Ole Miss, Manning was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. He was named SEC Quarterback of the Quarter Century (1950–75) by several publications.

==Professional career==
Manning was the second overall pick in the 1971 NFL draft and played for the New Orleans Saints for ten full seasons. During his tenure in New Orleans, the Saints had nine losing seasons. They reached .500 only once, in 1979, the only season they finished higher than third in the division. Nevertheless, he was well-respected by NFL peers. For example, although Manning was sacked 337 times during his Saints career, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; senior writer Paul Zimmerman wrote in 2007 that the number should have been even higher than that. Zimmerman wrote that opposing defensive linemen, &quot;Jack Youngblood in particular&quot; as well as most of the division rival Rams, were known to take it easy on the poorly protected Manning and not hit him as hard as they could. For his part, Manning seemed to appreciate Youngblood&#x27;s kindness, telling the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on September 23, 1974, &quot;The Rams front four is the best I ever faced ... I&#x27;ve got to say that Youngblood was nice enough to pick me up every time he knocked my ass off.&quot; Today, Manning jokes that Youngblood&#x27;s career would not have been as successful without him. He even stated that Youngblood should have let him be his presenter when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001, saying, &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t have gotten in without having me to sack.&quot;
In 1972, he led the league in pass attempts and completions and led the National Football Conference in passing yards, though the team&#x27;s record was only 2–11–1. Manning sat out the entire 1976 season after corrective surgery on his right shoulder, spending the second half of that season in the team&#x27;s radio booth after Dick Butkus abruptly quit his position as color commentator. In 1978, he was named the NFC Player of the Year by UPI after leading the Saints to a 7–9 record. That same year, Archie was also named All-NFC by both the UPI and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

Manning was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1978 and 1979. He finished his career with the Houston Oilers (1982–1983) and the Minnesota Vikings (1983–1984). He ended his 13-year career having completed 2,011 of 3,642 passes for 23,911 yards, 125 touchdowns, and 173 interceptions. He also rushed for 2,197 yards and 18 touchdowns. His 2,011 completions ranked 17th in NFL history upon his retirement. His record as a starter was 35–101–3 (26.3%), the worst in NFL history among QBs with at least 100 starts. He retired having never played on a team that notched a winning record or made the playoffs. Indeed, he is one of the few players to have played 10 or more years in the NFL without taking part in an official playoff game.

The Saints have not reissued Manning&#x27;s No. 8 since he left the team midway through the 1982 season. While it has not been formally retired, it has long been understood that no Saint will ever wear it again.

==Post-NFL career==
Manning continues to make his home in New Orleans, though he also owns a condo in Oxford, Mississippi, to which he relocated following Hurricane Katrina. He has served as an analyst with the Saints&#x27; radio and television broadcasts, and has worked as a commentator for CBS Sports&#x27; college football broadcasts. Archie has also appeared as a commercial spokesman for products in Southeast Louisiana, where he remains popular with many fans. Working with his three sons, Cooper, Peyton, and Eli, Archie hosts the Manning Passing Academy each summer. This camp brings together young players from grades 8–12 who work with high school coaches and college players. In 2007, Manning was awarded the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America. The Silver Buffalo is the highest award given for service to youth on a national basis.

In 2007, Manning was hired as a spokesman for a United Parcel Service contest to promote its &quot;Delivery Intercept&quot; service. He appeared in an advertising campaign for the UPS Delivery Intercept Challenge Video Contest, which saw amateur videos of football interceptions from high school and youth games. Among the prizes were a tailgate party with Manning as well as Manning-autographed footballs.

In October 2013, Manning was selected to be one of the 13 inaugural members of The College Football Playoff Selection Committee. He is one of three appointees who are members of the College Football Hall of Fame.

In 2014, for health reasons, he stepped down from the College Football Playoff Committee.

Manning owns a football-themed restaurant called Manning&#x27;s Sports Bar and Grill, located in Caesars New Orleans.

==Family==
Archie Manning is married to Olivia Manning. They met while at Ole Miss. The couple has three sons: Cooper, Peyton, and Eli. Cooper was diagnosed with spinal stenosis prior to his freshman year of college, which ended his football career. Peyton played 18 years in the NFL, winning two Super Bowls and a record five NFL MVPs among many other accolades. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021. Eli, who played 16 years in the NFL, won two Super Bowls in 2008 and 2012, earning the MVP award for both games. Cooper&#x27;s son, Arch, the top-rated high school quarterback in the class of 2023, is a member of the University of Texas football squad.

<text>U.S. Route 266 (US 266) is a , east–west U.S. Numbered Highway in Okmulgee, McIntosh, and Muskogee counties in Oklahoma, United States, that connects U.S. Route 62 U.S. Route 75 (US 62/US 75) in Henryetta with U.S. Route 64 (US 64) in Warner. The highway no longer meets the former route of its parent, U.S. Route 66 (US 66), and is closely paralleled by Interstate 40 (I-40), which replaced US 266 (along with accompanying routes US 62 from Oklahoma City to Henryetta and US 64 from Warner to the Arkansas border west of Fort Smith, Arkansas) as the major east–west highway east of Oklahoma City during the 1960s.

==Route description==
US 266 begins at US 62/US 75 on the northeast side of Henryetta, approximately north of I-40. The highway heads east from this point, quickly crossing into the town of Dewar, which it bisects. As it leaves Dewar, US 266 turns northeast, crossing Coal Creek and the Deep Fork River. The highway bypasses Hoffman to the east, providing access via Hoffman Road. The route then passes through the southeastern outskirts of Grayson. The highway then turns due east. Immediately after the curve, the highway serves as the southern terminus of Oklahoma State Highway 52&#x27;s northern section. US 266 then continues east into McIntosh County.

US 266 continues due east, running parallel to the Deep Fork Arm of Eufaula Lake, the reservoir&#x27;s northernmost arm. South of Council Hill, the highway intersects Oklahoma State Highway 72 (SH-72) at its southern terminus. US 266 turns south-southeast, continuing the alignment of SH-72. The route then turns back to the east and heads into the city of Checotah. On the west side of town, US 266 has an interchange with the modern freeway route of U.S. Route 69 (US 69). Further east, in downtown Checotah, the route intersects the old alignment of US 69 (US 69 Business). The highway heads due east out of Checotah, descending a ridge and passing just south of its summit, Mt. Nebo. The highway passes under I-40 just before crossing into Muskogee County.

Just under east of the McIntosh–Muskogee county line, US 266 intersects the southern Oklahoma State Highway 2 (SH-2). US 266 begins a concurrency with the state route (SH-2), traveling northwest to an interchange with I-40, numbered as Exit 278. The highways then curve around to due north to pass through Warner. On the north edge of Warner lies an intersection with US 64, where both US 266 and SH-2 end. Continuing straight puts the traveler on westbound US 64 toward Tulsa, while turning right brings the motorist onto eastbound US 64 toward Fort Smith, Arkansas.

==History==
Prior to the inception of the U.S. highway system, Oklahoma State Highway 9 (SH-9) covered much of the corridor from Oklahoma City to Spiro. Upon the US route system&#x27;s inception, US 266 replaced SH-9 from its junction with US 66 at 23rd Street and Lincoln Boulevard in Oklahoma City to US 64 in Warner. By 1930, along with changes to several other branches of US 66, the route was truncated at Henryetta. The segment from Oklahoma City to Henryetta became part of US 62, which was commissioned in 1930.

<text>Snorri Þorbrandsson (also Snorri Thorbrandsson) was a 10th-century Icelandic warrior. The main sources of Snorri&#x27;s life are the semi-historical Icelandic sagas.
Snorri appears as a character in the Icelandic &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot;. He was from the area of Álftafjörður in west Iceland. He was a blood-brother of Snorri goði and comrade-in-arms with Þorfinnr Karlsefni. Following mild injury and outlawry resulting from a conflict with Steinthor Thorlaksson (Steinthor of Eyr), Snorri traveled to Greenland with his brother Thorleif Kimbi and perished in battle against the &quot;skrælings&quot;, the Indigenous peoples of the Americas), during Karlsefni&#x27;s trip to Vinland.

<text>Middleham ( ; meaning &quot;middle &quot;ham&quot;&quot;, i.e. &quot;middle village&quot;) is a market town and civil parish in the district and county of North Yorkshire, England. It lies in Wensleydale in the Yorkshire Dales, on the south side of the valley, upstream from the junction of the River Ure and River Cover. There has been a settlement there since Roman times. It was recorded in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Medelai&quot;.

==History==

Though there is no evidence of civil settlement in the Roman period, a rural villa was discovered in the 19th century some east of the castle, in farmland south of the road to Masham. A branch road from the major Roman thoroughfare of Dere Street passed by, across the valley, through the fort of Wensley to the Roman site of Virosidium at Bainbridge.
Before the Norman Conquest, the lands around were controlled by Gilpatrick. In 1069, William the Conqueror granted them to his Breton cousin Alan Rufus, who built a wooden motte-and-bailey castle above the town. By the time of the 1086 Domesday Book, Alan had passed the castle to his brother Ribald. Its earthworks are still visible at William&#x27;s Hill. Alan also built the castle at Richmond.

Construction began in 1190 of Middleham Castle, which still dominates the town. The Nevilles, Earls of Westmorland, acquired it through marriage to a female descendant of Ribald in the 13th century. It has been dubbed the &quot;Windsor of the North&quot;. The castle belonged to Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, when his cousin Richard, Duke of Gloucester (the future Richard III) came there to learn knighthood skills in 1462. During the Wars of the Roses, both Edward IV and Henry VI were held prisoner there. Richard, Duke of Gloucester, became master of the castle in 1471 after Warwick&#x27;s death at the Battle of Barnet. He used it as his political base for ruling the North on behalf of his brother Edward IV. Richard married Warwick&#x27;s daughter, Anne Neville, in 1472. Middleham Castle is where their son Edward was born in about 1473 and died in April 1484. Richard III, who died in August 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth, was the last reigning King of England to perish in battle.

Under Richard III, Middleham was a bustling market town and political centre. In 1389, the Lord of Middleham Manor received a crown grant to hold a weekly market and yearly fair on the feast of St Alkelda the Virgin. The town has market places: the larger, lower one is dominated by a medieval cross, topped by a modern iron cross in Celtic style. The upper or swine market centres on the remains of a 15th-century market cross and a line of steps. At one end of the cross is a worn effigy of an animal reclining; the other may have had a moulded capital.

Most buildings in old parts of Middleham predate 1600. The old rectory incorporates some medieval features. In 1607 Middleham was important enough to house a royal court for residents of the forest of Wensleydale. Middleham and surrounding lands were part of the Crown estates from the accession of Richard III until Charles I sold the manor to the City of London in about 1628. In 1661 the City of London sold Middleham Manor on to Thomas Wood of Littleton. It has remained in private hands since then. In 1915 the annual livestock market was still regionally important, but the weekly market had been discontinued. Today&#x27;s livestock market is in Leyburn.

==Parish church==

The Church of Saints Mary and Alkelda was founded in 1291. Its mainly 14th and 15th-century architecture includes some stones that indicate a church on the site perhaps a century before. The only remaining Norman artefact is a section of zigzag moulding that once surrounded a door or window and now appears above the north aisle. The church has a three-metre Perpendicular font cover and a replica of the Middleham Jewel, found locally. West of the church is St Alkelda&#x27;s Well, whose waters were once said to restore weak eyes.

In 1478 Edward IV gave permission for a leper hospital to be built on the east side of town, in conjunction with the church. The location, Chapel Fields, now holds a horse-training stables. No trace of a hospital or chapel remains.

==Middleham today==

Today&#x27;s Middleham is a centre of horse racing and home to Middleham Trainers&#x27; Association. The first racehorse trainer at Middleham was Isaac Cape in 1765. Today there are several, including Mark Johnston, Jedd O&#x27;Keefe, James Bethell, and Ben Haslam. Racing is the foremost employer in the town and tourism the second. The castle is a ruin, having been dismantled in 1646, but the keep, built by Robert Fitz Ralph in the 1170s, survives, as do the 13th-century chapel and 14th-century gatehouse.

Middleham has four pubs, a village shop, a fish and chip shop, a tea room, several bed and breakfast suppliers, a primary school and nursery and a community centre called Middleham Key Centre. The picture depicts the &quot;Richard III Hotel&quot;. The building next door was a tearoom called The Nosebag. It is now a Racing Welfare office providing support and guidance to hundreds of stable staff based in and around the town.

==Governance==
Middleham is part of the Richmond (Yorks) parliamentary constituency. The current Member of Parliament is Rishi Sunak, a Conservative, who is also a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. His predecessor was William Hague, former Conservative Party Leader and Foreign Secretary, who represented the constituency from 1989 to 2015.

An electoral ward of the name exists, stretching south-west to Melmerby in Coverdale. Its population in the 2011 census was 1,284, when the parish population was 825 in the 2011 census, estimated at 781 in 2019.

==Treasure and archaeological finds==
===Middleham Jewel===
In 1985 the Middleham Jewel was found on a bridle path near Middleham Castle by Paul Kingston and Ted Seaton using a metal detector. A late 15th-century 68-gram gold pendant with a 10-carat blue sapphire stone, it has since passed to the Yorkshire Museum in York for £2.5 million. The lozenge pendant, engraved on the obverse with a representation of the Trinity, is bordered by a Latin inscription warding off the evil of epilepsy. The reverse has a decorative engraving of the Nativity, bordered by faces of 13 saints.

The back panel slides to reveal a hollow interior, which originally contained three-and-a-half tiny discs of silk embroidered with gold thread. The textile contents identify the jewel as a reliquary, containing a fragment of reputed holy cloth. It would have been worn by a lady of high social status as the crest for a large necklace. The sapphire may represent Heaven, and have acted as an aid to prayer.

===Other notable finds===
Other notable finds from Middleham include:
*The Middleham Hoard – three pots containing 5,099 silver coins in total, buried in the English Civil War. This is the largest such hoard ever found.
*A livery badge for pinning to the chest or a hat, in gilded copper high relief, with Richard III&#x27;s emblem of a white boar – this is likely to have been worn by one of his household, when he was Duke of Gloucester.
*The Middleham ring in the Yorkshire Museum, found in 1990 – this gold ring is decorated with a low-relief inscription along the band reading &quot;SOVEREYNLY&quot;.
*A circular, copper-alloy plaque ( diameter) bearing the initials &quot;R&quot; and &quot;A&quot; surrounded by the French motto &quot;A Vo. Plaisir&quot; (For your pleasure) – this may be a casket mark given by Richard, Duke of Gloucester to his wife Anne.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Bilsdale transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio York on 104.3 FM, BBC Radio Tees can also be received on 95.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio York &amp; North Yorkshire on 103.5 FM and Dales Radio on 104.9 FM.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; and &quot;Darlington &amp; Stockton Times&quot;.

==Geography and geology==
The town lies between above ordnance datum. The valley of the River Ure below the town has an altitude of and the summit of the hill to the south-west of the town of . The parish contains of land, mostly permanent pasture with about arable. The topsoil is mixed. The valley has modern alluvial terraces and gravel deposits, but the subsoil is mainly limestone, intersected here and there by sandstone with plate. There is a known vein of lead in the northern part of the parish. Braithwaite lead mine lies just outside the parish borders.

==Notable people==
In birth order:
*Anne Neville (1456–1485), consort of King Richard III of England, spent most of her childhood at the castle.
*Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales (1473–1484) was born and died at the castle.
*Tobias Pullen (1648–1713), religious controversialist and Church of Ireland bishop, was born in the town.
*John Baynes (1758–1787), miscellanist and lawyer, was born in the town.
*Job Marson (1817–1857), a celebrated jockey, died at Middleham.
*John Osborne Jr. (c. 1833–1922) jockey.

==Popular culture==
Middleham appeared three times in the UK television series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;. The episode &quot;Against the Odds&quot; had the Manor House as the home of the Barraclough family. In the episode &quot;Where Sheep May Safely Graze&quot;, Middleham Antiques, in North Road, became Geoff Hatfield&#x27;s confectionery shop. Ferndale became the home of the Darnley sisters in the episode &quot;The Rough and the Smooth&quot;.

==Twin town==

Middleham is twinned with Azincourt, France.

<doc id="640672" wikidata="Q283631" url="?curid=640672" title="XD-Picture Card">
<text>The xD-Picture Card is an obsolete form of flash memory card, used in digital cameras made by Olympus, Fujifilm, and Kodak during the 2000s. The xD in the xD-Picture Card stands for eXtreme Digital.

xD cards were manufactured with capacities of 16 MB up to 2 GB. The standard was phased out in the late 2000s in favour of the SD card, which had been its primary competitor.

== History ==
The cards were developed by Olympus and Fujifilm, and introduced into the market in July 2002. Toshiba Corporation and Samsung Electronics manufactured the cards for Olympus and Fujifilm. xD cards were sold under other brands, including Kodak, SanDisk, PNY, and Lexar, but were not branded with the respective companies&#x27; logos, except for Kodak. Previously, xD competed primarily with Secure Digital (SD) cards, CompactFlash (CF), and Sony&#x27;s Memory Stick. Because of its higher cost and limited usage in products other than digital cameras, xD lost ground to SD, which is broadly used by cellular phones, personal computers, digital audio players and many other digital cameras.

Olympus began to move away from the xD format with the mid-2009 announcement of the E-P1 camera, which supported only Secure Digital memory cards. As of Spring 2010, all new Olympus cameras announced at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show and Photo Marketing Association International Trade Show can use SD cards. This changeover to the SD card format has never been officially announced by Olympus Corporation. The higher-end DSLR cameras such as the E-3 and E-5 among others continue to use CompactFlash cards as well. Certain final Olympus cameras using xD cards are also supporting microSD cards with a special adapter.

Fuji released its last digital camera accepting that card, namely Fujifilm FinePix F200EXR (a variant of 2008 FinePix F100fd), being released back in Q2 2009, as being moving away from xD format since Q4 2008.

== Comparison with rival formats ==
Amazon &quot;Best Sellers in xD-Picture Cards&quot; reports no products offered with a &quot;Date First Available&quot; since 4 August 2009.

=== Advantages ===
* Contains no flash translation layer (designed to emulate the block device structure of a magnetic disk drive). Better-designed flash file systems can directly access the NAND flash hardware.
* Very similar to a standard NAND chip. Modified XD readers can be used to read arbitrary NAND chips.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Card format is proprietary to Fujifilm and Olympus, just as the Memory Stick format is to Sony. No public documentation was available (see below for reverse-engineering results). In contrast, the CompactFlash format is described by completely open and free specifications.
* Has not kept up with the transfer rate, or speed, of other cards, notably CompactFlash and SD, but also the later versions of the Memory Stick. The fastest xD card offers less than 10% of the speed of current (2009) CompactFlash cards.
* Directly derived from the SmartMedia card. Thus, has no wear leveling controller. May have a shorter life span than comparable cards with FTL wear levelers &quot;if&quot; the file system used does not take into account wear leveling.
* Generally more expensive than other memory card types. , 2 GB (2000 MB) xD cards&#x27; retail prices are approximately three times those of same-capacity SD cards.
* Many newer Olympus and Fujifilm digital cameras accept the more popular SD or CF cards, in addition to or instead of the xD format.
* Small maximum capacity relative to other memory card formats. First-generation xD cards (Type S) have a maximum capacity of only 512 MB. Type M expands the theoretical maximum capacity to 8 GB (8000 MB), but , there are no cards available with capacity greater than 2 GB.
* Although physically smaller than Secure Digital and Memory Stick cards, xD cards are &quot;larger&quot; than these competitors&#x27; reduced-size variants (microSD and Memory Stick Micro).
* Less widely supported by camera, card reader, and accessory manufacturers than other formats. , SD cards (and variants) are supported by all consumer-level digital cameras from major manufacturers.

== Type M/M+ and Type H cards ==


The original xD cards (Type S) were available in 16 MB to 512 MB capacities. The Type M card, released in February 2005, uses multi-level cell (MLC) architecture to achieve a theoretical storage capacity of up to 8 GB. , Type M cards are available in sizes from 256 MB to 2 GB. However, the Type M suffers from slower read/write speeds than the original cards.

The Type H card, first released in November 2005, offers higher data rates than Type M cards (theoretically as much as 3 times faster). As of 2008, Type H cards were only available in 256 MB, 512 MB, 1000 MB, and 2000 MB capacities. Both Fuji and Olympus discontinued the production of Type H cards in 2008, citing high production costs.

The Type M+ card, first released in April 2008, offers data rates 1.5 times that of Type M cards. As of 2008, cards are available only in 1 and 2 GB capacities.

Olympus says that its xD cards support special &quot;picture effects&quot; when used in some Olympus cameras, though these software features are not intrinsically hardware-dependent. Type H and M+ cards however, are required in newer models to capture video at high rate (640×480 @ 30fps). Due to changes in the cards&#x27; storage architecture, newer Type M and H cards may have compatibility issues with some older cameras (especially video recording). Compatibility lists are available for Olympus: Olympus America&#x27;s and Fujifilm&#x27;s. Newer cards are incompatible with some card readers.

== Theoretical transfer speeds ==

Pictures may be transferred from a digital camera&#x27;s xD card to a personal computer by plugging the camera into the PC by a USB or IEEE 1394 cable, or by removing the card from the camera and inserting it into a card reader. In both cases, the computer sees the card as a mass storage device containing image files, although software or firmware can alter this representation. Card readers may be integrated into the PC or attached by cable. Adapters are available to allow an xD picture card to be plugged into other readers (and in some cases cameras), including PC card, parallel port, CompactFlash and SmartMedia. A chart showing which sizes and types of xD cards were available can be found below.
== Reverse-engineered specifications ==
Detailed specifications are tightly controlled by Olympus and Fujifilm, which charge licensing fees and royalties and require non-disclosure agreements in exchange for the technical information required to produce xD-compatible devices.

The memory format used is not well documented. It is difficult to study it directly, since most camera devices and most USB card readers do not provide direct access to the flash memory. Since the cards are controller-less, cameras and card readers must perform wear leveling and error detection. They normally hide the portion of the memory which stores this information (among other things) from higher level access.

However, a few models of xD card readers based on the Alauda chip &quot;do&quot; allow direct access (bypassing the above mechanisms) to an xD card&#x27;s flash memory. These readers have been reverse-engineered and Linux drivers have been produced by the Alauda Project, which has documented the on-chip data structures of the xD card. According to this information, xD card headers are similar to those used by SmartMedia, and include chip manufacturer information.

== Raw hardware ==


At the raw hardware level, an xD card is simply an ordinary NAND flash integrated circuit in an unusual package. Comparing the pinout of an xD card to the pinout of a NAND flash chip in a standard TSOP package, one finds a nearly one-to-one correspondence between the active pins of the two devices. xD cards share this characteristic with the older SmartMedia cards, which are also basically raw NAND flash chips, albeit in a larger package.

xD and SmartMedia cards can be used by hobbyists as a convenient source of NAND flash memory chips for custom projects. For example, the Mattel Juice Box PMP can be booted into Linux using a modified cartridge containing an xD card with a boot image written on it. Additionally, SmartMedia and xD card readers can be used to read the data from NAND flash chips in electronic devices, by soldering leads between the chip and the card reader.

== Panoramic mode ==
Some Olympus cameras offer camera-based panoramic processing. In those cameras that support both xD and CompactFlash cards, panoramic processing only works with images stored on the xD card, if installed. Newer Olympus cameras have neither xD cards nor this restriction.

Unsubtantiated reports claim that some cameras such as the E-450 only support panoramic processing when using Olympus branded xD cards. The model numbers have not been documented. In this case, there appears to be a workaround: it appears that the card manufacturer information is simply stored in the flash memory, in the Card Information Structure. Thus, it is possible to alter another brand of xD card to present itself as Olympus xD card by accessing the raw flash memory. This can be done by using a hacked device driver for a USB card reader.

<doc id="640682" wikidata="Q3051561" url="?curid=640682" title="Elmer Flick">
<text>Elmer Harrison Flick (January 11, 1876 – January 9, 1971) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball from 1898 to 1910 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Philadelphia Athletics, and Cleveland Bronchos/Naps. In 1,483 career games, Flick recorded a .313 batting average while accumulating 164 triples, 1,752 hits, 330 stolen bases, and 756 runs batted in (RBIs). He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963.

Flick began his career in semi-professional baseball and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed by George Stallings, the manager of the Phillies, who signed Flick as a reserve outfielder. Flick was pressed into a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. Flick jumped to the Athletics in 1902, but a court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to play for the remainder of his major league career, which was curtailed by a stomach ailment.

Flick was known predominantly for his solid batting and speed. He led the National League in RBIs in 1900, and led the American League in stolen bases in 1904 and 1906, and in batting average in 1905.

==Early life==
Flick was born on January 11, 1876, the third of five children of Zachary and Mary Flick, on the family farm in Bedford, Ohio. His father was a farmer and mechanic who had served in the American Civil War. Flick attended Bedford High School, where he played catcher on the school&#x27;s baseball team. He also played American football, wrestled, and boxed.

Flick entered semi-professional baseball by chance. When he was 15 years old, he was at a train station to support the local baseball team as it left for a road trip. Only eight of the team&#x27;s players showed up at the station, so Flick was recruited to go on the trip with the team. Though Flick did not have a uniform or shoes, he hit well in both games of the doubleheader, though Bedford lost both games. He joined the Bedford team on a regular basis, and he continued to play semi-pro baseball throughout his teenage years.

==Professional career==

===Minor league baseball===
In 1896, the manager of the Youngstown Puddlers of the Interstate League signed Flick. Because the team had an established catcher, Flick played in the outfield, where he struggled to learn the position. In 31 games, Flick had a .826 fielding percentage. However, Flick had a strong performance offensively. Using his father&#x27;s lathe, Flick crafted his own baseball bat, which he used to hit for a .438 batting average.

The next year, Flick played for the Dayton Old Soldiers, also in the Interstate League, as their regular left fielder. His defense improved, as he compiled a .921 fielding percentage, and he batted .386. He also led the league with 20 triples and 295 total bases.

===Major League Baseball===
George Stallings, the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League (NL), noticed Flick while he played for Dayton. Stallings signed Flick to the Phillies to serve as a reserve outfielder for the team in the 1898 season. Starting outfielder Sam Thompson injured his back after six games, forcing Stallings to play Flick. In his debut game, Flick went 2-for-3 with two singles against Fred Klobedanz. Thompson returned to the team briefly, but reinjured his back and announced his retirement in May, allowing Flick to play regularly. Flick proved himself a capable big leaguer, batting .302 with eight home runs, 13 triples and 81 runs batted in (RBIs). In the 1899 season, he batted .342, with 98 runs scored and 98 RBIs. However, he suffered a serious knee injury in August, and reinjured the knee when he returned to the game too quickly.

Before the 1900 season, Philadelphia stars Napoleon Lajoie and Ed Delahanty held out of renewing their contracts with the team. Other members of the team had grown disgruntled. Amid talk of a revival of the American Association, Flick and several other players began to talk about not returning to the team the next year. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported that Flick&#x27;s father was in the chair business in Cleveland and that he might require Flick&#x27;s help with the business. Flick agreed to a contract extension before the season started.
That year, he led the NL with 110 RBIs. He finished second in the NL with a .367 batting average, a .545 slugging percentage, 11 home runs, 59 extra-base hits, and 297 total bases. He also engaged in a fistfight with Lajoie that caused Lajoie to miss five weeks due to a broken thumb. The race for the batting title came down to the end of the season. The title winner, Honus Wagner, later said, &quot;I&#x27;ve had a lot of thrills, but don&#x27;t think I was ever happier than in 1900 when I won after battling Elmer Flick to the last day of the season for the title.&quot;

Flick was one of many star NL players who jumped to the fledgling American League (AL) after the 1901 season, playing for the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics. Flick played in 11 games for the Athletics, before the Phillies obtained an injunction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibiting any player under contract with the Phillies from playing for another team. Though this injunction named Lajoie, Bill Bernhard, and Chick Fraser only, it still applied to Flick as well. As a recourse, Flick and teammate Lajoie signed instead with the Cleveland Naps, as the Pennsylvania injunction could not be enforced in Ohio. The two players often traveled separately from their teammates for the next year, never setting foot in Pennsylvania in order to avoid a subpoena. Flick spent the remainder of his career in Cleveland, and the contract dispute was resolved when the leagues made peace in September 1903 with the National Agreement.

On July 6, 1902, Flick hit three triples in one game. Between 1900 and 2010, 49 players accomplished that feat. By early 1904, Flick did not want to re-sign with Cleveland for the offered $2,500 ($ in current dollar terms). Plans were being made to run a railroad through a corner of Flick&#x27;s farm and Flick hoped to hire some of his horses to the construction team. &quot;After July 4, my farm work will be along so that I will be able to give considerable attention to independent ball&quot;, he said.

Flick did return to Cleveland for the 1904 season. That year, Flick tied teammate Harry Bay for the league lead with 38 stolen bases. Flick was the AL batting champion in the 1905 season with a .308 average. Only Carl Yastrzemski, who won the batting title with a .301 average in the 1968 season, led the league with a lower average. Flick also led the league with a .462 slugging percentage and 18 triples in 1905. His .383 on-base percentage trailed only Topsy Hartsel. During a 1905 game, Cleveland fielders were charged with seven errors in a single inning, but Flick committed only one of the errors.
In the 1906 season, Flick played a league-leading 157 games. He led the league with 700 plate appearances, 624 at-bats, 98 runs scored, 22 triples, and 39 stolen bases (tied with John Anderson). However, Flick was &quot;said to be dissatisfied with the team&quot;, and the Naps considered trading him to the Detroit Tigers for Matty McIntyre. Before the 1907 season, the Naps turned down a trade with the Tigers which would have exchanged Flick for the 21-year-old Ty Cobb. Hughie Jennings, the Tigers&#x27; manager, was tired of dealing with Cobb&#x27;s abrasive behavior. The Naps refused to part with Flick, even in exchange for Cobb. They countered with Bunk Congalton, but the Tigers declined. Flick had been holding out but he signed a few days after the proposed trade. After Cobb was nearly traded away, Jennings attempted to repair the difficult relationships between Cobb and the other Detroit players. &quot;Cobb is too good a hitter to let get away, when a little diplomacy will get the boys together&quot;, Jennings said. In the 1907 season, Flick again led the league with 18 triples.

However, baseball took its toll on Flick. Before the 1907 season, he considered retiring to pursue other business opportunities. By 1908, he developed stomach problems. Cleveland personnel initially said that the illness was related to Flick&#x27;s overeating. He left training camp that year, complaining of &quot;train sickness&quot;, and returned home to Cleveland. He missed the majority of the 1908 season, playing in only nine games. He missed the beginning of the 1909 season as well, as a doctor recommended Flick have his appendix removed. Now weighing , Flick was afraid of a bad outcome from the surgery, which was a significant risk at the time. He kept his appendix and played in 66 games, batting .255. He played in another 24 games in the 1910 season before he was again sidelined by his stomach ailment.

The Naps acquired Shoeless Joe Jackson from the Athletics in a trade and had him replace Flick in the lineup. In July 1910, the Naps sold Flick to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, but Flick refused to report to Kansas City, which cancelled the transaction.

===Later career===
In 1911, Flick looked to continue his career. Unable to find a major league team willing to sign him, he returned to the minor leagues. The Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association purchased him from Cleveland. Flick played for Toledo in 1911 and 1912. He batted .326 in the 1911 season and .262 in the 1912 season, but did not hit for power. The Mud Hens released him at the end of the 1912 season. He retired from professional baseball after being released by Toledo, though he briefly played as a second baseman for a local amateur team in Bedford in 1914.

Flick retired without playing in a World Series.

==Later life==
Returning to Bedford, Flick hunted, raised horses, built buildings, and became involved in selling real estate. He also scouted for Cleveland. Only four 19th-century baseball players, including Flick, were still alive in 1970. In his later years, Flick still answered requests for autographs from his fans. Proud of his longevity, Flick often completed autographs by writing the date and his age above or underneath his signature.

Flick was married to Rosa Ella (née Gates). The couple had five daughters. Flick died of congestive heart failure on January 9, 1971, two days before his 95th birthday, in his hometown of Bedford. He had also suffered from mycosis fungoides.

==Honors==
When Cobb died in 1961, stories written about him mentioned the attempted trade between Cleveland and Detroit, which revived interest in Flick. Flick was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963 after being unanimously elected by the Veterans Committee (VC). When he received the call from Branch Rickey that he had been selected, Flick did not believe Rickey at first. He said that he did not even realize that he was being considered for election at the time. Flick&#x27;s family had to convince him that the call was real. He was the oldest living inductee in Hall of Fame history. At his induction, the 87-year-old Flick said, &quot;This is a bigger day than I&#x27;ve ever had before. I&#x27;m not going to find the words to explain how I feel.&quot;

Subsequent to his induction, writers have questioned the validity of Flick&#x27;s Hall of Fame membership. James Vail characterized Flick and three other Hall of Famers as &quot;some of the most dubious VC choices ever&quot;. David Fleitz wrote that Rickey&#x27;s influence on the Veterans Committee led to Flick&#x27;s election, as Rickey was the only committee member who had seen Flick play. Author Robert E. Kelly pointed out that Flick&#x27;s career was relatively short and that stronger candidates from Flick&#x27;s era (such as Sherry Magee) had not been inducted.

Flick was enshrined in the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1977, and the Ohio Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987. A statue of Flick&#x27;s likeness was created to be placed in Bedford; it was funded by donations and was ultimately dedicated in September 2013. Mike Hargrove was among the baseball figures who attended the dedication ceremony.

<doc id="640685" wikidata="Q174406" url="?curid=640685" title="Republican Sinn Féin">
<text>Republican Sinn Féin or RSF () is an Irish republican political party in Ireland. RSF claims to be heirs of the Sinn Féin party founded in 1905; the party took its present form in 1986 following a split in Sinn Féin. RSF members take seats when elected to local government in the Republic of Ireland, but do not recognise the validity of the Partition of Ireland. It subsequently does not recognise the legitimacy of the parliaments of Northern Ireland (Stormont) or the Republic of Ireland (Leinster House), so the party does not register itself with them.

The party emerged around the supporters of Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill. As Irish republican legitimists, they rejected the reformism of Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Féin who supported abandoning the policy of abstentionism from the Oireachtas and accepting the legality of the Republic of Ireland. They support the Éire Nua policy which allows for devolution of power to provincial governments. RSF holds that the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916 legally continues to exist, and that the Continuity Irish Republican Army Council is its &quot;de jure&quot; government.

The organisation views itself as representing &quot;true&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; Irish republicanism, while in the mainstream media the organisation is portrayed as a political expression of &quot;dissident republicanism&quot;. Republican Sinn Féin rejects the Good Friday Agreement and the Anglo-Irish Treaty; as part of this they assert that Irish republicans have the right to use militant means to &quot;defend the Irish Republic&quot; and considers the Continuity Irish Republican Army (IRA) to be the legitimate army of the Irish Republic, and the Continuity IRA Army Council its legal government.

==History==
The modern origins of the party date from the mid 1980s. The decision to form, reorganise or reconstitute, as its supporters see it, the organisation was taken in response to Gerry Adams-led Sinn Féin&#x27;s decision at its 1986 &quot;ard fheis&quot; to end its policy of abstentionism and to allow elected Sinn Féin Teachtaí Dála (TDs) to take their seats in Leinster House&#x27;s Dáil Éireann. Those who went on to form RSF opposed this move as it signalled a departure from the traditional republican analysis, which viewed the Dáil as an illegal assembly set up by an act of Westminster. They argued that republicans owed their allegiance to the Irish Republic, maintaining that this state existed &quot;de jure&quot; and that its authority rested with the IRA Army Council. (See: Irish republican legitimatism) As Ruairí Ó Brádaigh declared:

Although it was passed by a two-thirds majority, those who went on to re-organise RSF claimed that the decision to end abstention was invalid under the Sinn Féin constitution, Section 1b of which stated: &quot;No person ... who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership.&quot; They pointed out that in their opinion the correct procedure was to drop or amend Section 1b of the constitution in one year, then come back the next year and propose entering Leinster House, when Section 1b was no longer in operation. In protest, they staged a walkout from the ardfheis and reconvened the ardfheis at another venue. RSF subsequently claimed that the delegates who had voted to drop abstentionism had in effect expelled themselves from the party. It is on this basis that RSF views itself as the only party entitled to the name of Sinn Féin and the sole legitimate successor to the original Sinn Féin established in 1905. Supporters of abstentionism also claimed that the vote at the ardfheis was gerrymandered. Journalist Ed Moloney points out that in 1986 the number of votes at the ardfheis, which reflects the size of Sinn Féin, almost doubled from 1985 to 1986, and then reverted to the 1985 level in 1987.

Adams-led Provisional Sinn Féin argued that a previous &quot;ardfheis&quot; in 1983 amended the constitution so that &quot;no aspect of the constitution and rules be closed to discussion&quot;. This was done to enable the ardfheis to debate a motion to allow Sinn Féin candidates to stand in elections to the European Parliament and to take their seats if successful. Some argue that this argument is weakened, by the fact that candidature to the European Parliament had already been debated at the 1978 ardfheis, when a motion to stand candidates in the 1979 European elections was defeated at the Sinn Féin ardfheis. A vote to change abstentionism from a principle to a tactic failed to achieve a two-thirds majority vote in 1985. The results were 181 opposed and 161 in favour.

There is disagreement on the number of people who walked out. Brian Feeney claims that after the vote was passed about 20 members, led by Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, walked out. J. Bowyer Bell, in &quot;The Irish Troubles&quot;, states that Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill &quot;and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) at a previously hired hall in a hotel outside Dublin&quot;. Whatever the number, that evening, approximately 130 people, including some of the delegates who voted against the motion, reconvened at Dublin&#x27;s West County Hotel and established RSF. By itself, the RSF Officer Board formed that evening had 6 members, also formed was an organising committee of 15 members. Bell also notes that in response to the split, there was a &quot;flurry of military operations in and around Belfast&quot; by the Provisional IRA during the remainder of the year to show &quot;country militants that the city was not a centre of politics&quot;.

At the centre of those who helped to re-organise as Republican Sinn Féin were key people who formed the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin, including Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, Des Long, Joe O&#x27;Neill, Frank Glynn, and Dáithí Ó Conaill. Among those in attendance at the first Bodenstown commemoration, staged by the version of the Continuity Republican Movement which RSF sees itself as forming part of, were four members of the first Provisional IRA Army Council: Ruairí Ó Brádaigh (Longford), Dáithí Ó Conaill (Cork/Dublin), Leo Martin (Belfast), and Paddy Mulcahy (Limerick). Among those present at the West County Hotel when RSF was formed was Billy McKee, an early member of the Provisional IRA Army Council, and the former O/C Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA. Another early supporter of RSF was Sean Tracey, a member of the first Provisional IRA Army Council, who later &quot;drifted away&quot; from RSF.

The influence of those who founded Provisional Sinn Féin should not be understated. Of the 20 people on the Sinn Féin Caretaker Executive formed in January 1970, ten were still involved in PSF in 1986. Nine of the ten joined Republican Sinn Féin.

The origins of the party are also described in the documentary &quot;Unfinished Business: The Politics of &#x27;Dissident&#x27; Irish Republicans&quot;.

==Positions==

===Irish sovereignty===
Republican Sinn Féin believes that the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916 during the Irish Republican Brotherhood organised Easter Rising, founded an all-Ireland sovereign state and that the first and second meetings of the Dáil Éireann were the last legitimate sitting governments of Ireland. RSF rejects the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 which led to the creation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland as an act of treason and refer to it as the &quot;Treaty of Surrender.&quot; The regime sitting in Leinster House is regarded by RSF as being founded as an illegitimate British-puppet state (and latterly a fiefdom of Brussels) analogous to Vichy France during World War II and the assembly at Stormont House as a more overt manifestation of &quot;occupation.&quot; It quotes Wolfe Tone who said of an urgent need to &quot;break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our political evils&quot; in calling for the &quot;complete overthrow of British rule in Ireland&quot;.

It also refuses to recognise the validity of the Good Friday Agreement as it argues that the referendum on the agreement did not offer the people of Ireland the choice of living in a united Ireland, and that the referendum was invalid since separate polls were held in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It also opposes the Northern Ireland Assembly as it believes that this further entrenches British presence in Ireland, and that &quot;those nationalists who took their seats in the new Stormont&quot; were &quot;guilty of treachery to the Irish Republic&quot;.

Republican Sinn Féin does not consider the Defence Forces (descended from the pro-Treaty National Army of the Irish Civil War) to be the armed forces of the Irish Republic, rather it claims that the Irish Republican Army is the only organisation that has the right to the title of the &quot;Óglaigh na hÉireann&quot;. This includes in succession; the Irish Republican Army (1917–22), the Irish Republican Army (1922–69), the Provisional Irish Republican Army (1969–86) and since then the Continuity Irish Republican Army. These organisations are all considered by it to simply be the one Irish Republican Army founded by the merger of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army.

===Foreign affairs===
Republican Sinn Féin maintains that Ireland should remain independent of large power blocks and thus is a Eurosceptic party. The people who would go on to found RSF, while they were still members of Provisional Sinn Féin in 1972 opposed Ireland being brought into the European Economic Community, which later became the European Union. RSF in any case does not recognise the Single European Act, Maastricht Treaty, Amsterdam Treaty, Treaty of Nice and Treaty of Lisbon as it applies to Ireland, because these agreements were ratified by what it sees as completely &quot;illegitimate&quot; regimes at Leinster House in Dublin and (for the north) Westminster Palace in London.

In a more general sense, it says there is a &quot;danger of the growing European Union becoming a world superpower in its own right&quot; and that it could be a participant in potential &quot;resource wars&quot; of the 21st century, something it says Ireland cannot support as it would end up &quot;swapping British domination for European domination&quot;. It further criticised the EU as taking a &quot;highly centralised political and economic power-bloc&quot; whose decision making is made in what they termed &quot;completely undemocratic institutions&quot;; and that EU bureaucrats work against the interest of small farmers and restructure industry so that the EU centre can prosper at Ireland&#x27;s expense. Amongst all these issues it said that Ireland&#x27;s neutrality is under threat.

RSF says that because of Ireland&#x27;s history as a &quot;colonial possession&quot; it supports other national liberation struggles around the world and &quot;feel[s] a sense of solidarity with all peoples who are struggling for freedom and justice&quot;. The party calls itself &quot;internationalist&quot; as it says it recognises that &quot;we all have a common identity as human beings, as members of the great family of peoples [and] we wish to play our role in this wider world community on the basis of equality and respect for the rights of others&quot;. In that vein, it supports debt relief for developing countries. It also advocates Ireland&#x27;s neutrality in avoiding military alliances and power blocs.

===Cultural policy===
Other policies of the RSF include the separation of church and state and the importance of the Irish language &quot;to the Irish identity&quot;. It is also abstentionist as both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were created by acts of the British Parliament against what it called the &quot;wishes of the Irish people&quot;.

===Social policy===
It stands on a platform of the establishment of social justice based on what it describes as the principles of Irish Republican Socialism, based on the 1916 proclamation of an Irish Republic. This is outlined in the party&#x27;s social and economic policy document Saol Nua. It also has a policy named &quot;Éire Nua&quot; (&quot;New Ireland&quot;), which would see the establishment of a 32 county Ireland completely independent of the United Kingdom and set up as a federation of the four Irish provinces.

==Leadership==
At their reorganisation, the Chairman of Republican Sinn Féin was Dáithí Ó Conaill. At the party&#x27;s first Ard-Fheis, they elected their first president, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, who had been president of Sinn Féin from 1970 to 1983. He was joined by Dáithí Ó Conaill, another prominent figure in Sinn Féin and the IRA in the 1970s. On 28 September 2009 Ó Brádaigh announced that he was to step down as RSF leader, citing age and health grounds for his decision. On 15 November 2009, he was succeeded by Des Dalton.

On 10 November 2018, Dalton&#x27;s tenure as president ended after nine years, and Seosamh Ó Maoileoin was announced as the new president of Republican Sinn Féin along with acting vice-presidents Pádraig Garvey and Daire Mac Cionnaith. Líta Ní Chathmhaoil and Dónall Ó Ceallaigh are the general secretaries, and Diarmuid MacDubhghlais and Anthony Donohue are the treasurers. Gearóid Ó Bruachain is the publicity officer.

===Leadership history===
==Publications==
&quot;Saoirse Irish Freedom&quot; is the monthly organ of Republican Sinn Féin. It replaced &quot;Republican Bulletin&quot;, the first issue of which appeared in November 1986 to explain the reasons for the split in Sinn Féin. The name &quot;Saoirse Irish Freedom&quot; is derived from the 1910–1914 publication &quot;Irish Freedom&quot;.

Its format was eight A4 pages, continuing monthly until May 1987. In November of that year, &quot;Saoirse&quot; became an eight-page tabloid. Since then, the paper has been produced as a 16-page monthly magazine. In June 1996 RSF first published an issue online.

==Splits==
In September 2005, a number of cumainn (or branches) and individual members of RSF left the party in protest over the party&#x27;s treatment of Continuity IRA prisoners held in Portlaoise Prison. As a consequence of this dispute, a number of people resigned from RSF and formed the Concerned Group for Republican Prisoners to raise funds and provide moral support for the former Continuity IRA-aligned prisoners they supported. However a majority of the prisoners chose to return and the organisation as of 2011 is defunct.

In August 2010 it was reported that members of the Limerick cumann were expelled, and had first adopted the name Limerick Independent Republican Organisation, before changing it to Real Sinn Féin, then simply Republican Sinn Féin, and finally Continuity Sinn Féin. In the following years two opposing groups in Limerick, one loyal to local man Joe Lynch, the other loyal to the leadership in Dublin under Des Dalton, claimed to be the &quot;real&quot; Republican Sinn Féin.

==Relationship to other republican organisations==

RSF sees itself as forming part of a wider Republican Movement with a number of organisations which share a similar or identical ideological and political perspective. These include (but are not limited to) the Continuity IRA, Cumann na mBan, Fianna Éireann, Cabhair and the National Commemoration Committee and the Republican Prisoners Action Group. Across these organisations there is believed to be some level of dual membership with RSF. RSF strenuously rejects the allegation that it is the &quot;political wing&quot; of the Continuity IRA, as it denies any assertion that the latter is its &quot;military wing&quot;.

===Position of foreign governments===
Some foreign governments in the Anglosphere have taken a public position against Republican Sinn Féin; the United States State Department lists the party as a &quot;terrorist organisation&quot; along with the Continuity IRA. The State Department states that the CIRA &quot;is a terrorist splinter group formed in 1994 as the clandestine armed wing of Republican Sinn Féin, which split from Sinn Féin in 1986. &#x27;Continuity&#x27; refers to the group&#x27;s belief that it is carrying on the original Irish Republican Army&#x27;s (IRA) policy of being the army of the Irish Republic. CIRA&#x27;s alleged aliases, Continuity Army Council and Republican Sinn Féin, were also designated as FTOs.&quot; The British government currently lists the Continuity Army Council and the Irish Republican Army as a &quot;terrorist group&quot; under the &quot;Terrorism Act 2000,&quot; but does not mention Republican Sinn Féin.

==Electoral participation==

Though the RSF&#x27;s policy of abstentionism means that it would not take seats in Dáil Éireann, the Northern Ireland Assembly or the British House of Commons, if elected, it has contested local elections in the Republic and Assembly elections in Northern Ireland in 2007.

===First elections===
It initially planned to field 23 candidates, including three sitting councillors elected for Sinn Féin in 1985, in the 1989 local government elections in Northern Ireland. However, shortly before the elections, the British Parliament introduced the &#x27;Elected Authorities (Northern Ireland) Act&#x27; which required that all prospective candidates sign the following declaration renouncing:

::&quot;(a) any organisation that is for the time being a proscribed organisation specified in Schedule 2 to the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978: or&quot;
::&quot;(b) acts of terrorism (that is to say, violence for political ends) connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland&quot;.

RSF refused to do so on the grounds that such an oath &quot;calls for the public disowning of the Irish Republican Army, Cumann na mBan, Fianna Éireann and a repudiation of the right of the Irish people to use force of arms to end British occupation&quot;. Consequently, its candidates did not stand. It is not registered with the Electoral Commission as a political party in Northern Ireland meaning that in elections in Northern Ireland, the party name cannot appear on the ballot paper, and the party cannot make party political broadcasts.

===1991 local elections===
The results for 1991 are only partially available. A number of other people stood for RSF, including Tomás Ó Curraoin, David Joyce and Frank Glynn in Galway, and Jimmy Kavanagh in Wexford. Two sitting councillors, Joe O&#x27;Neill (Bundoran UDC) and Seán Lynch (Longford County Council) were re-elected. Sitting county councillor Frank Glynn lost his seat on Galway County Council which he had held for 24 years.

Among the unsuccessful were Peter Cunningham in South Dublin County Council, Declan Curneen in Leitrim County Council and Joe O&#x27;Neill in Donegal County Council.

===1999 local elections===
In the 1999 local elections in the Republic of Ireland, RSF candidates received 1,390 votes in county/city council elections, and 149 votes urban district council level.

Seán Lynch, of Longford County Council, was reelected.
The following were unsuccessful: Joe O&#x27;Neill Donegal County Council who also lost his seat on the Bundoran Urban District Council, John MacElhinney Letterkenny Urban District Council, Des Long Limerick City Council, Tomás Ó Curraoin Galway County Council and Geraldine McNamara Tipperary Urban District Council.

===2004 local elections===
RSF ran seven candidates in the local elections in the Republic of Ireland. The party&#x27;s only elected representative lost his seat in the elections. Netting a total of 2,403 first preference votes, the RSF share of the total valid poll (1,819,761) was 0.13 per cent. Unsuccessful candidates were Seán Lynch who lost his seat on Longford County Council, Tomás Ó Curraoin Galway County Council, Seán O&#x27;Neill Limerick City Council, Mick Ryan Limerick City Council, Des Dalton Kildare County Council, Terence Varian Midleton Town Council and Donal Varian Cobh Town Council.

===2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election===
It ran six candidates in the 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election. As the party did not register with the Electoral Commission, the candidates ran as Independents. They were Michael McGonigle East Londonderry, Geraldine Taylor West Belfast, Michael McManus Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Joe O&#x27;Neill West Tyrone, Brendan McLaughlin Mid Ulster and Barry Toman Upper Bann.

The six candidates netted a total of 2,522 first preference votes, and their share of the total valid poll (690,313) was 0.37 per cent.

===2009 local elections results===
Republican Sinn Féin fielded nine candidates in the 2009 Irish local elections. As the party is not registered, the party&#x27;s candidates were labelled non-party or independents.

One of the candidates was successful—Tomás Ó Curraoin in the Connemara electoral area for Galway County Council, receiving 1,387 votes or 8.4% of the valid poll. The unsuccessful candidates were Seán Lynch Longford County Council, Mick Ryan and Sean O&#x27;Neill Limerick City Council, Des Dalton Athy Town Council, Paddy Kenneally Clare County Council, Peter Fitzsimons Kells Town Council, Séamus Ó Suilleabháin Limerick County Council and Pat Barry Bundoran Town Council.

===2014 to 2024 local elections results===

Republican Sinn Féin Councillor Tomás Ó Curraoin retained his seat in the Connemara electoral area for Galway County Council receiving 1,072 votes (6.36% of the total vote). Pádraig Garvey unsuccessfully ran for election to Kerry County Council receiving 489 votes.

Tomás Ó Curraoin once again retained his seat in the 2019 Galway County Council election, receiving 971 votes (10.8% of the total vote) and being re-elected on the fourth count. Ó Curraoin was also re-elected at the 2024 Galway County Council election, with 974 votes (9.9%).

<text>Sergio Panunzio (20 July 1886 – 8 October 1944) was an Italian theoretician of national syndicalism. In the 1920s, he became a major theoretician of Italian Fascism.

==Early life==
Sergio Panunzio was born on 20 July 1886 in Molfetta, Italy. He started his political involvement young by associating with syndicalist circles in 1902. From the University of Naples, he obtained two degrees, in jurisprudence in 1908 and in philosophy in 1911.

==Career==
Panunzio became the head of the Fascist Faculty of Political Sciences at Perugia University in 1928.

Panunzio said that syndicalism is the historical development of Marxism. He pointed to Georges Sorel and Francesco Saverio Merlino as revising Karl Marx to fit the times and emboldening it. He is said to have spearheaded the revisionism that led many syndicalists through interventionism to corporativism and he ostensibly &quot;gave Mussolini&#x27;s dictatorship a veneer of revolutionary legitimacy&quot;.

Panunzio criticized the Soviet state as a &quot;dictatorship &quot;over&quot; the proletariat, and not &quot;of&quot; the proletariat&quot;. He is quoted as saying, &quot;Moscow bows before the light radiating from Rome. The Communist International no longer speaks to the spirit; it is dead.&quot; He opposed the anti-Semitic campaign of 1938. A strong supporter of the state for its own sake, he had a long-running academic dispute with the corporatist Carlo Costamagna regarding the role of fascism.

==Death==
Panunzio died on 8 October 1944.

<text>Stephen LaTreal McNair (February 14, 1973 – July 4, 2009), nicknamed &quot;Air McNair&quot;, was an American professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons. He started his first two seasons with the Houston Oilers before the team relocated to Nashville, Tennessee. There, McNair would become the first franchise quarterback of the Tennessee Titans. He also played for two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens.

McNair played college football for the Alcorn State Braves, with whom he won the 1994 Walter Payton Award as the top player in NCAA Division I-AA. He was selected third overall by the Oilers in the 1995 NFL draft. He started six games in his first two seasons combined before becoming the team&#x27;s regular starting quarterback for the 1997 season, and he remained the starting quarterback for the Titans through 2005. After the 2005 season, McNair was traded to the Ravens, with whom he played for two seasons before retiring.

McNair appeared in the playoffs four times with the Titans, including their run to Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000, and made his final playoff appearance in 2006 with the Ravens. McNair was selected to the Pro Bowl three times, and was an All-Pro and Co-MVP in 2003. McNair was the first African-American quarterback to win AP NFL MVP and remains, along with Cam Newton, Patrick Mahomes, and Lamar Jackson, only one of four to win the award. In 2009, McNair was shot and killed by his girlfriend in a murder–suicide; he was 36.

==Early life==
McNair was born in a small tin-roofed house in Mount Olive, Mississippi, on February 14, 1973. He had four brothers, Fred, Jason, Michael, and Tim. He attended Mount Olive High School as a freshman in the fall of 1987, where he played football, baseball, and basketball in addition to running track. As a junior, McNair led the Mount Olive Pirates to the state championship. McNair also played free safety in high school, and in 1990 alone, he intercepted 15 passes, raising his career total to 30, which tied the mark established by Terrell Buckley at Pascagoula High School. An All-State selection (offense), McNair was named an All-American by Super Prep magazine (defense).

The Seattle Mariners drafted him in the 35th round of the 1991 MLB amateur draft.

==College career==
McNair was initially offered a full scholarship to the University of Florida to play running back, but wanting to play quarterback, McNair chose Alcorn State University, a Historically Black University which competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I-AA (now known as the Football Championship Subdivision) Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). In 1992, McNair threw 3,541 yards and 29 touchdowns, and ran in for 10 more scores. The Braves fashioned a record of 7–4, including a last-second victory in their rematch with Grambling. In that contest, McNair returned from an injury and helped Alcorn State, trailing late in the final period, move deep into Tigers&#x27; territory. Then, despite a leg injury, he tucked the ball under his arm and dove into the end zone for the winning touchdown. The victory over Grambling helped the Braves qualify for the I-AA playoffs where they faced off against then-Northeast Louisiana, falling 78–27 to the Indians on November 21, 1992. McNair helped Alcorn State to another good year in 1993, as the Braves upped their record to 8–3 while McNair threw for more than 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. He was also named First-Team All-SWAC for the third year in a row.

In his senior season, McNair gained 6,281 combined yards rushing (904) and passing (5,377), along with 56 touchdowns. His total offense averages were 571 y/g over 11 games, an all-divisions collegiate per game record. In the process, he surpassed more than a dozen records and was named an All-American. In addition, McNair won the Walter Payton Award as the top I-AA player and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting behind Rashaan Salaam and Ki-Jana Carter. McNair set career records for the Football Championship Series with 15,010 passing yards, as well as the division record for total offensive yards with 17,305 career yards. McNair&#x27;s record for career passing, total offensive yards, and total number of plays still stand, but his marks for career passing completions and attempts were eclipsed by Samford quarterback Devlin Hodges in 2018.

He was a member of the fraternity Omega Psi Phi, highlighting his allegiance by tattooing &quot;Omega Man&quot; on his arm.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans===

====1995–1996====
With the third overall pick in the 1995 NFL draft, the Houston Oilers and new head coach Jeff Fisher selected McNair, making him at the time the highest-drafted African-American quarterback in NFL history and signing him to a seven-year contract. McNair did not see his first action until the last two series of the fourth quarter in a November game versus the Cleveland Browns. Late in the season, he also appeared briefly against the Detroit Lions and New York Jets. In 1996, McNair remained a backup to Chris Chandler until starting a game on December 8 in Week 15 against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

====1997 season====
McNair&#x27;s first season as the Oilers&#x27; starter in 1997 (the team&#x27;s first year in Tennessee) resulted in an 8–8 record for the team, which played its home games at the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, Tennessee. McNair&#x27;s 2,665 passing yards were the most for the Oilers in a season since Warren Moon in 1993, and his 13 interceptions were the fewest for a single season in franchise history. He also led the team in rushing touchdowns with eight and ranked second behind running back Eddie George with 674 yards on the ground, at the time the third-highest total for a quarterback in NFL history.

====1998 season====
In 1998, McNair set career passing highs with 492 attempts, 289 completions, 3,228 yards, and 15 touchdowns for the Oilers, now playing in Nashville. He also cut his interceptions to ten, helping his quarterback rating climb to 80.1.

====1999 season: Super Bowl season====
The team officially changed its name from Oilers to Titans for the 1999 season as they debuted a new stadium, Adelphia Coliseum. Early in the season, McNair was diagnosed with an inflamed disk following the Titans&#x27; 36–35 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, and needed surgery. In his stead entered Neil O&#x27;Donnell, a veteran who had guided the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl four years earlier. Over the next five games, O&#x27;Donnell led the Titans to a 4–1 record. McNair returned against the St. Louis Rams, and with McNair starting, Tennessee won seven of its last nine games, good for a 13–3 record and second place in the AFC Central.

The Titans opened the playoffs at home against the Buffalo Bills in a Wild Card game, winning on the &quot;Music City Miracle&quot; and eventually advancing to Super Bowl XXXIV in a rematch with the Rams. On the second-to-last play of the game with the Titans facing 3rd down and 5 to go, McNair was hit by two Rams defenders, but he somehow got away and completed a 16-yard pass to Kevin Dyson to gain a 1st down at the Rams&#x27; 10-yard line. On the final play of the game, McNair&#x27;s pass to Dyson was complete, but Dyson was unable to break the plane of the goal line, giving the Rams the win. In his only Super Bowl appearance, McNair threw 22-of-36 for 214 yards while rushing eight times for 64 yards. McNair signed a new six-year contract after the 1999 season worth US$47 million.

====2000–2001====
McNair played in all 16 games in 2000 but did not start the first of two annual games against the Steelers. This was because of a sternum injury incurred in a 17–14 win over the Kansas City Chiefs the previous game. Following the Titans’ bye week Neil O&#x27;Donnell started against his former team, but after O’Donnell threw three picks he was sacked out of the game in the final four minutes. McNair came in and threw a touchdown to Erron Kinney; a missed Steelers field goal attempt resulted in the Titans winning 23–20.

Following a 13–3 season in 2000 which ended in a playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens, McNair put together his most productive year as a pro in 2001. In 2001, McNair registered career passing highs in yards (3,350), completions (264), touchdowns (21), and quarterback rating (90.2). He was also the team&#x27;s most effective rusher, tying George for the club lead with five scores. Named to the Pro Bowl for the first time, McNair sat out the game due to a shoulder injury.

====2002 season====
In 2002, Tennessee finished the regular season 11–5 and reached the playoffs. In the divisional round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, McNair threw for a career postseason high 338 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions, while rushing for 29 yards and another score on the ground. The game had a controversial finish when, after missing a game-winning field goal at the end of regulation time and a second failed kick in overtime was negated because of a controversial running-into-the-kicker penalty on Pittsburgh&#x27;s Dewayne Washington, kicker Joe Nedney won the game from 26 yards out 2:15 into overtime. Steelers coach Bill Cowher said that he called a timeout before the winning kick took place. McNair and the Titans reached the AFC Championship game but were unable to reach the Super Bowl, losing to the Oakland Raiders 41–24.

Between the 2002 and 2003 seasons, McNair was arrested for DUI and illegal gun possession in May 2003. His blood alcohol was above 0.10, and a 9-mm handgun was sitting in the front of the car. All charges related to the incident were later dropped.

====2003 season: MVP season====
In December of the 2003 season, an injured calf and ankle kept McNair sidelined for two games, though he still finished with the best numbers of his career, including 3,215 passing yards, 24 touchdown passes, just seven interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 100.4. The Titans finished 12–4, the same record as the Colts, but Indianapolis took the AFC South division championship by virtue of its two victories over Tennessee. McNair and Colts quarterback Peyton Manning were named co-NFL MVPs following the 2003 season, which ended for the Titans in a playoff loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. McNair finished the 2003 season as the league leader in passer rating and became the youngest player in NFL history to pass for 20,000 yards and run for 3,000 yards.

====2004–2005 ====
McNair missed the 2004 season&#x27;s fourth game with a bruised sternum, an injury suffered the previous week against Jacksonville, and played in only five more games that season. In 2005, he played in 14 games because of a back injury.

This series of season-ending injuries prompted the Titans to make the business decision of locking McNair out of team headquarters in the 2006 offseason. The team would not let him rehab in its building because it feared an injury would force the franchise to pay him $23.46 million (his contract had been restructured so often that his salary cap reached a hard-to-manage amount). The Players Association&#x27;s filed a grievance on his behalf in which an arbitrator ruled that the team violated its contract, opening the possibility for a trade.

===Baltimore Ravens===
Following the 2005 season, on April 30, 2006, the Titans allowed McNair and his agent, James &quot;Bus&quot; Cook, to speak with the Baltimore Ravens to try to work out a deal. By May 2006, the Baltimore Sun reported that the Ravens were interested in McNair. Speculation was that the Titans might hold onto McNair until the week before training camp in late July if the Ravens didn&#x27;t come up with a satisfactory trade offer for McNair according to a league source. However, on June 7, 2006, the two teams worked out a deal to send McNair to the Ravens for a 4th-round pick in the 2007 NFL draft. On June 8, McNair flew to Baltimore, passed a physical, and was announced as the newest member of the Ravens.

====2006 season====

The 2006 season saw McNair start each game for the Ravens, missing only portions of two games. In the week 14 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, McNair threw the longest regular-season touchdown pass in the Ravens&#x27; history, an 89-yard touchdown pass to Mark Clayton. McNair led Baltimore to a 13–3 record and an AFC North Championship. He made his first playoff start as a Raven against the Colts on January 13, 2007. McNair completed 18 of 29 pass attempts for 173 yards, no touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Ravens lost, 15–6.

====2007 season====
On May 9, 2007, McNair was arrested in Nashville for drunk driving even though he was not driving at the time. It is a misdemeanor offense in Tennessee for an owner of a motor vehicle to knowingly allow an intoxicated person to drive the vehicle. McNair was riding in his own pickup truck as a passenger when the police stopped the truck&#x27;s driver, McNair&#x27;s brother-in-law, for speeding. The driver failed a field sobriety test and was arrested for DUI; McNair was charged with DUI by consent. The quarterback&#x27;s charge was dropped on July 10, 2007, when McNair&#x27;s brother-in-law pleaded guilty to reckless driving.

In 2007, McNair did not play in Week 2 against the Jets in which the Ravens won 20–13. He also did not play the full game in Week 3, however, the game was won by the Ravens, 26–23. McNair missed nine more games during the rest of the season, due primarily to injury, only starting in six games. He announced his retirement following the 2007 season.

===Retirement===
After 13 seasons in the NFL, McNair announced his retirement from professional football in April 2008. At the time he retired, McNair was one of just three quarterbacks (Fran Tarkenton and Steve Young being the others) to throw for 30,000 yards and run for 3,500 yards.

In July 2012, McNair was named the 35th greatest quarterback of the NFL&#x27;s post-merger era, according to Football Nation.

Steve&#x27;s number was retired by the Titans during a halftime ceremony against the Indianapolis Colts on September 15, 2019.

McNair was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2012 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Personal life==
McNair was married to Mechelle McNair from June 21, 1997, until his death. He split his time between a farm in Mississippi and Nashville, Tennessee. McNair had two sons with Mechelle: Tyler and Trenton; and two sons – Stephen LaTreal McNair Jr. and Steven O&#x27;Brian McNair – with two other women before he and Mechelle married.

McNair earned the nickname &quot;Air McNair&quot; in high school. He opened his own restaurant in Nashville, which he named Gridiron9.

NFL linebacker Demario Davis is his cousin.

==Death==
On July 4, 2009, McNair was found dead from multiple gunshot wounds, along with the body of a 20-year-old woman named Sahel &quot;Jenni&quot; Kazemi, in a condominium rented by McNair in downtown Nashville. He was 36 years old. Kazemi and McNair had been previously involved with each other romantically. The day of the shooting, text messages between the pair were exchanged proclaiming their love to one another in which Kazemi texted the victim, &quot;u love me&quot; in which McNair replied, &quot;I love you baby.&quot; There was also a conversation about financial issues where McNair transferred $2,000 to Kazemi, who claimed she was &quot;stressed&quot; and needed to pay her phone bill. McNair then offered to come over to check on her after she said her chest felt heavy. The night of his death, McNair put his children to bed, then at 11:00 p.m. he texted Kazemi &quot;On my way.&quot; 

McNair, who was believed to have been asleep on the couch when the shooting occurred, was shot twice in the chest and twice in the head, with only one of the shots coming from closer than . After killing him, Kazemi sat on the couch beside him and shot herself in the temple. The bodies were discovered by McNair&#x27;s friends Wayne Neely and Robert Gaddy, who called 911. The Nashville police declared McNair&#x27;s death a murder-suicide, with Kazemi as the perpetrator and McNair as the victim. The 9mm gun used was found under Kazemi&#x27;s body and later tests revealed &quot;trace evidence of (gunpowder) residue on her left hand. Kazemi had a worsening financial situation and also suspected that McNair was in another extramarital relationship.

Two days before their deaths, Kazemi was pulled over in a black 2007 Cadillac Escalade in Nashville. McNair was in the passenger seat and Vent Gordon, a chef at a restaurant McNair owned, was in the back seat. The vehicle was registered in the names of both McNair and Kazemi. She was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. McNair was not arrested, instead leaving in a taxi with Gordon, despite Kazemi repeatedly asking the arresting officer to tell McNair to come to the police car to talk to her. However, McNair later bailed Kazemi out of jail. The police later stated that after being released from jail, Kazemi purchased the gun from a convicted murderer she met while looking for a buyer for her Kia.

Titans owner Bud Adams released a statement regarding McNair:

In a statement to the AP, Ozzie Newsome, executive vice president and general manager of the Baltimore Ravens, stated:
The Titans held a two-day memorial at LP Field on July 8 and 9, 2009, where fans could pay their last respects to McNair. Highlights of his career were played throughout each day and fans were able to sign books that were later given to the McNair family.

During the 2009 NFL season, every member of the Titans wore a commemorative &quot;9&quot; sticker placed on the back of each helmet to honor McNair. Funeral services were held for McNair at the Reed Green Coliseum on the campus of the University of Southern Mississippi on July 11; he was buried at Griffith Cemetery in Prentiss, Mississippi.

McNair died without a last will and testament, and his assets were frozen pending probate of his estate. On October 15, 2010, it was reported that McNair&#x27;s widow went to a Nashville judge and asked that at least a portion of the assets be unfrozen for his children&#x27;s care and expenses until the estate matters were resolved in court. The judge agreed, and each of the four children received $500,000.

<text>Ruairí Ó Brádaigh (; born Peter Roger Casement Brady; 2 October 1932 – 5 June 2013) was an Irish republican political and military leader. He was Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) from 1958 to 1959 and again from 1960 to 1962, president of Sinn Féin from 1970 to 1983, and president of Republican Sinn Féin from 1987 to 2009.

==Early life==
Ó Brádaigh, born Peter Roger Casement Brady, was born into a middle-class republican family in Longford that lived in a duplex home on Battery Road. His father, Matt Brady, was an IRA volunteer who was severely wounded during an attack with the Royal Irish Constabulary in 1919. His mother, May Caffrey, was a Cumann na mBan volunteer and graduate of University College Dublin, class of 1922, with a degree in commerce. His maternal grandmother was a French-speaking Swiss Lutheran. His father died when he was ten, and was given a paramilitary funeral led by his former IRA colleagues. His mother, prominent as the Secretary for the County Longford Board of Health, lived until 1974. Ó Brádaigh was educated at Melview National School at primary level and attended secondary school at St. Mel&#x27;s College, leaving in 1950, and University College Dublin, from where he graduated in 1954 with a commerce degree (BComm), like his mother, and certification in the teaching of the Irish language. That year he took a job teaching Irish at Roscommon Vocational School in Roscommon.

Ó Brádaigh was a deeply religious Catholic who refrained from smoking or drinking.

==Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army==
He joined Sinn Féin in 1950. While at university, in 1951, he joined the Irish Republican Army. In September 1951, he marched with the IRA at the unveiling of the Seán Russell monument in Fairview Park, Dublin. A teacher by profession, he was also a Training Officer for the IRA. In 1954, he was appointed to the Military Council of the IRA, a subcommittee set up by the IRA Army Council in 1950 to plan a military campaign against Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in Northern Ireland.

On 13 August 1955, Ó Brádaigh led a ten-member IRA group in an arms raid on Hazebrouck Barracks, near Arborfield, Berkshire. It was a depot for the No. 5 Radar Training Battalion of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. It was the biggest IRA arms raid in Britain and netted 48,000 rounds of .303 ammunition, 38,000 9 mm rounds, 1,300 rounds for .380 weapons, and 1,300 .22 rounds. In addition, a selection of arms were seized, including 55 Sten guns, two Bren guns, two .303 rifles and one .38 pistol. Most if not all of the weapons were recovered in a relatively short period of time. A van, travelling too fast, was stopped by the police and IRA personnel were arrested. Careful police work led to weapons that had been transported in a second van and stored in London.

The IRA Border Campaign commenced on 12 December 1956. As an IRA General Headquarters Staff (GHQ) officer, Ó Brádaigh was responsible for training the Teeling Column (one of the four armed units prepared for the Campaign) in the west of Ireland. During the Campaign, he served as second-in-command of the Teeling Column. On 30 December 1956, he partook in the Teeling Column attack on Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in Derrylin, County Fermanagh. RUC Constable John Scally was killed in the attack; Scally was the first fatality of the new IRA campaign. Ó Brádaigh and others were arrested by the Garda Síochána across the border the day after the attack, in County Cavan. They were tried and jailed for six months in Mountjoy Prison for failing to account for their whereabouts. O&#x27;Bradaigh was a leading abstentionist, upon his arrest he refused to recognize the authority of the Irish government and refused to renounce violence in exchange for his release.

Although a prisoner, he was elected a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Longford–Westmeath constituency at the 1957 Irish general election, winning 5,506 votes (14.1%). Running on an abstentionist ticket, Sinn Féin won four seats which went to Ó Brádaigh, Eighneachán Ó hAnnluain, John Joe McGirl and John Joe Rice. They refused to recognise the authority of Dáil Éireann and stated they would only take a seat in an all-Ireland parliament—if it had been possible for them to do so. Ó Brádaigh did not retain his seat at the 1961 Irish general election, and his vote fell to 2,598 (7.61%).

Upon completing his prison sentence, he was immediately interned at the Curragh Military Prison, along with other republicans. On 27 September 1958, Ó Brádaigh escaped from the camp along with Dáithí Ó Conaill. While a football match was in progress, the pair cut through a wire fence and crept from the camp under a camouflage grass blanket and went &quot;on the run&quot;. This was an official escape, authorised by the officer commanding of the IRA internees, Tomás Óg Mac Curtain. He was the first Sinn Féin TD on the run since the 1920s.

That October, Ó Brádaigh became the IRA Chief of Staff, a position he held until May 1959, when an IRA Convention elected Sean Cronin as C/S; Ó Brádaigh became Cronin&#x27;s adjutant general. Ó Brádaigh was arrested in November 1959, refused to answer questions, and was jailed under the Offences against the State Act in Mountjoy. He was released from Mountjoy in May 1960 and, after Cronin was arrested, he again became C/S. Although he has always emphasised that it was a collective declaration, he was the primary author of the statement ending the IRA Border Campaign in 1962. At the IRA 1962 Convention he indicated that he was not interested in continuing as chief of staff.

After his arrest in December 1956, he took a leave from teaching at Roscommon Vocational School. He was re-instated and began teaching again in late 1962, just after he was succeeded by Cathal Goulding in the position of Chief of Staff of the IRA. He remained an active member of Sinn Féin and was also a member of the IRA Army Council throughout the decade.

In the 1966 United Kingdom general election, he ran as an Independent Republican candidate in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, polling 10,370 votes, or 19.1% of the valid poll. He failed to be elected.

==Leader of Provisional Sinn Féin==
===1970–1973===

He opposed the decision of the IRA and Sinn Féin to drop abstentionism and to recognise the Westminster parliament in London, the Stormont parliament in Belfast and the Leinster House parliament in 1969/1970. On 11 January 1970, along with Seán Mac Stíofáin, he led the walkout from the 1970 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis (party convention) after the majority voted to end the policy of abstentionism (although the vote to change the Sinn Féin constitution failed as a two-thirds majority was required to do so, whereas the motion only achieved the support of a simple majority of delegates&#x27; votes). The delegates who walked out reconvened at the Kevin Barry Hall in Parnell Square, Dublin and established Provisional Sinn Féin.

He was voted chairman of the Caretaker Executive of Provisional Sinn Féin. That October, he formally became president of the party. He held this position until 1983. It is also likely that he served on the Army Council or the executive of the Provisional Irish Republican Army until he was seriously injured in a car accident on 1 January 1984. Among those joining him in Provisional Sinn Féin was his brother, Seán Ó Brádaigh, the first Director of Publicity for Provisional Sinn Féin. Seán Ó Brádaigh continued in this position for almost a decade, when he was succeeded by Danny Morrison, who had been editor of &quot;An Phoblacht/Republican News&quot;. Sean Ó Brádaigh was the first editor of the paper.

In the 1970s Ó Brádaigh made multiple visits to the Basque Country and considered the Basque independence movement as akin to the Irish situation.

In his presidential address to the 1971 Provisional Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, Ó Brádaigh said that the first step to achieving a United Ireland was to make Northern Ireland ungovernable.

On 31 May 1972 he was arrested under the Offences Against the State Act and immediately commenced a hunger strike. A fortnight later the charges against him were dropped and he was released.

With Dáithí Ó Conaill he developed the &quot;Éire Nua&quot; policy, which was launched on 28 June 1972. The policy called for a federal Ireland.

On 3 December 1972, he appeared on the London Weekend Television &quot;Weekend World&quot; programme. He was arrested by the Gardaí again on 29 December 1972 and charged in the newly established Special Criminal Court with Provisional IRA membership. In January 1973 he was the first person convicted under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1972 and was sentenced to six months in the Curragh Military Prison.

===1974–1983===
In 1974, he testified in person before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations regarding the treatment of IRA prisoners in Ireland. He also had a meeting with prominent Irish-American congressman Tip O&#x27;Neill. The same year, the State Department revoked his multiple entry visa and have since refused to allow Ó Brádaigh to enter the country. 1975 Federal Bureau of Investigation documents describe Ó Brádaigh as a &quot;national security threat&quot; and a &quot;dedicated revolutionary undeterred by threat or personal risk&quot; and show that the visa ban was requested by the British Foreign Office and supported by the Dublin government. In 1997, Canadian authorities refused to allow him board a charter flight to Toronto at Shannon Airport.

During the May 1974 Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike, Ó Brádaigh stated that he would like to see &quot;a phased withdrawal of British troops over a number of years, in order to avoid a Congo situation&quot;.

On 10 December 1974, he participated in the Feakle talks between the IRA Army Council and Sinn Féin leadership and the leaders of the Protestant churches in Ireland. Although the meeting was raided and broken up by the Gardaí, the Protestant churchmen passed on proposals from the IRA leadership to the British government. These proposals called on the British government to declare a commitment to withdraw, the election of an all-Ireland assembly to draft a new constitution and an amnesty for political prisoners.

The IRA subsequently called a &quot;total and complete&quot; ceasefire intended to last from 22 December to 2 January 1975 to allow the British government to respond to proposals. British government officials also held talks with Ó Brádaigh in his position as president of Sinn Féin from late December to 17 January 1975.

On 10 February 1975, the IRA Army Council, which may have included Ó Brádaigh, unanimously endorsed an open-ended cessation of IRA &quot;hostilities against Crown forces&quot;, which became known as the 1975 truce. The IRA Chief of Staff at the time was Seamus Twomey, of Belfast. Another member of the Council at this time was probably Billy McKee, of Belfast. Daithi O&#x27;Connell, a prominent Southern Republican, was also a member. It is reported in some quarters that the IRA leaders had mistakenly believed they had persuaded the British Government to withdraw from Ireland and the protracted negotiations between themselves and British officials were the preamble to a public declaration of intent to withdraw. In fact, as British government papers now show, the British entertained talks with the IRA in the hope that this would fragment the movement further, and scored several intelligence coups during the talks. It is argued by some that by the time the truce collapsed in late 1975 the Provisional IRA had been severely weakened. This bad faith embittered many in the republican movement, and another ceasefire was not to happen until 1994. In 2005, Ó Brádaigh donated, to the James Hardiman Library of University College, Galway, notes that he had taken during secret meetings in 1975–76 with British representatives. These notes confirm that the British representatives were offering a British withdrawal as a realistic outcome of the meetings. The Republican representatives—Ó Brádaigh, Billy McKee and one other—felt a responsibility to pursue the opportunity, but were also sceptical of British intentions.

In late December 1976, along with Joe Cahill, he met two representatives of the Ulster Loyalist Central Coordinating Committee, John McKeague and John McClure, at the request of the latter body. Their purpose was to try to find a way to accommodate the ULCCC proposals for an independent Northern Ireland with the Sinn Féin&#x27;s Éire Nua programme. It was agreed that if this could be done, a joint Loyalist-Republican approach could then be made to request the British government to leave Ireland. Desmond Boal QC and Seán MacBride SC were requested and accepted to represent the loyalist and republican positions. For months they had meetings in various places including Paris. The dialogue eventually collapsed when Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and vociferous opponent of the Provisional IRA, became aware of it and condemned it on RTÉ Radio. As the loyalists had insisted on absolute secrecy, they felt unable to continue with the talks as a result.

In the aftermath of the 1975 truce, the Ó Brádaigh/Ó Conaill leadership came under severe criticism from a younger generation of activists from Northern Ireland, headed by Gerry Adams, who became a vice-president of Sinn Féin in 1978. By the early 1980s, Ó Brádaigh&#x27;s position as president of Sinn Féin was openly under challenge and the &quot;Éire Nua&quot; policy was targeted in an effort to oust him. The policy was rejected at the 1981 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis and finally removed from the Sinn Féin constitution at the 1982 Ard Fheis. At the following year&#x27;s ard fheis, Ó Brádaigh and Ó Conaill resigned from their leadership positions, voicing opposition to the dropping of the Éire Nua policy by the party.

==Leader of Republican Sinn Féin==

On 2 November 1986, the majority of delegates to the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis voted to drop the policy of abstentionism if elected to Dáil Éireann, but not the British House of Commons or the Northern Ireland parliament at Stormont, thus ending the self-imposed ban on Sinn Féin elected representatives from taking seats at Leinster House. Ó Brádaigh and several supporters walked out and immediately set up Republican Sinn Féin (RSF); more than 100 people assembled at Dublin&#x27;s West County Hotel and formed the new organisation. As an ordinary member, he had earlier spoken out against the motion (resolution 162) in an impassioned speech. The Continuity IRA became publicly known in 1996. Republican Sinn Féin&#x27;s relationship with the Continuity IRA is similar to the relationship between Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA when Ó Brádaigh was Sinn Féin&#x27;s president.
Ó Brádaigh believed RSF to be the sole legitimate continuation of the pre-1986 Sinn Féin, arguing that RSF has kept the original Sinn Féin constitution. RSF readopted and enhanced Ó Brádaigh&#x27;s &quot;Éire Nua&quot; policy between 1988 and 2000. His party has had electoral success in local elections only, although they currently have one elected Councillor in Connemara, County Galway.

He remained a vociferous opponent of the Good Friday Agreement, viewing it as a programme to copperfasten Irish partition and entrench sectarian divisions in the north, condemning his erstwhile comrades in Provisional Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA for decommissioning weapons while British troops remain in the country. In his opinion, &quot;the Provo sell-out is the worst yet – unprecedented in Irish history&quot;. He has condemned the Provisional IRA&#x27;s decision to seal off a number of its arms dumps as &quot;an overt act of treachery&quot;, &quot;treachery punishable by death&quot; under IRA General Army Order Number 11.

In June 2005, he handed over a portion of his personal political papers detailing discussions between Irish Republican leaders and representatives of the British Government during 1974–1975 to the James Hardiman Library, National University of Ireland, Galway.

==Retirement==
In September 2009, Ó Brádaigh announced his retirement as leader of Republican Sinn Féin. His successor was Des Dalton. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh was also a long-standing member of the Celtic League, an organization which fosters cooperation between the Celtic people and promotes the culture, identity and eventual self-determination for the people, in the form of six sovereign states, for the Celtic nations - Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, Scotland, Isle of Man and Ireland.

==Death==
After suffering a period of ill-health, Ó Brádaigh died on 5 June 2013 at Roscommon County Hospital. His funeral was attended by 1,800 mourners including Fine Gael TD Frank Feighan and was policed by the Emergency Response Unit and Gardaí in riot gear, for &quot;operational reasons&quot;, a show of force believed to have been to deter the republican tradition of firing a three-volley salute of shots over the final place of rest during the graveyard oration. As a result there was some minor scuffles between gardai and mourners.

<doc id="640695" wikidata="Q2860391" url="?curid=640695" title="Architecture of Chicago">
<text>The buildings and architecture of Chicago reflect the city&#x27;s history and multicultural heritage, featuring prominent buildings in a variety of styles. Most structures downtown were destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 (an exception being the Water Tower).

Chicago&#x27;s architectural styles include the Chicago School primarily in skyscraper design, Chicago Bungalows, Two-Flats, and Greystones. The Loop is home to skyscrapers as well as sacred architecture including &quot;Polish Cathedrals&quot;. Chicago is home to one of the largest and most diverse collections of skyscrapers in the world.

==Skyscrapers==


Beginning in the early 1880s, architectural pioneers of the Chicago School explored steel-frame construction and, in the 1890s, the use of large areas of plate glass. These were among the first modern skyscrapers. William LeBaron Jenney&#x27;s Home Insurance Building was completed in 1885 and is considered to be the first to use steel in its structural frame instead of cast iron. However, this building was still clad in heavy brick and stone. The Montauk Building, designed by John Wellborn Root Sr. and Daniel Burnham, was built from 1882 to 1883 using structural steel. Daniel Burnham and his partners, John Welborn Root and Charles B. Atwood, designed technically advanced steel frames with glass and terra cotta skins in the mid-1890s, in particular the Reliance Building; these were made possible by professional engineers, in particular E. C. Shankland, and modern contractors, in particular George A. Fuller.

Louis Sullivan discarded historical precedent and designed buildings that emphasized their vertical nature. This new form of architecture, by Jenney, Burnham, Sullivan, and others, became known as the &quot;Commercial Style,&quot; but was called the &quot;Chicago School&quot; by later historians.

In 1892, the Masonic Temple surpassed the New York World Building, breaking its two-year reign as the tallest skyscraper, only to be surpassed itself two years later by another New York building.

Since 1963, a &quot;Second Chicago School&quot; has emerged from the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. The ideas of structural engineer Fazlur Khan were also influential in this movement. He introduced composite construction to tall tubular buildings, which in turn paved the way for the creation of supertall composite buildings such as Petronas Towers and the Jin Mao Building since the 1960s.

==Landmarks, monuments and public places==

Numerous architects have constructed landmark buildings of varying styles in Chicago. Among them are the so-called &quot;Chicago seven&quot;: James Ingo Freed, Tom Beeby, Larry Booth, Stuart Cohen, James Nagle, Stanley Tigerman, and Ben Weese.
Daniel Burnham led the design of the &quot;White City&quot; of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition which some historians claim led to a revival of Neo-Classical architecture throughout Chicago and the entire United States. Burnham developed the 1909 &quot;Plan for Chicago&quot; in a Neo-Classical style, although many skyscrapers were built after the Exposition closed, between 1894 and 1899. Louis Sullivan said that the fair set the course of American architecture back by two decades, but his work the Schlesinger and Meyer (later Carson, Pirie, Scott) store was built in 1899—five years after the &quot;White City&quot; and ten years before Burnham&#x27;s Plan.

Erik Larson&#x27;s history of the Columbian Exposition, &quot;The Devil in the White City&quot;, says that the building techniques developed during the construction of the many buildings of the fair were entirely modern, even if they were adorned in a way Sullivan found aesthetically distasteful.

Chicago&#x27;s public art includes outdoor works by Chagall, Picasso, Miró and Abakanowicz.

In the 21st century, Chicago has become an urban focus for landscape architecture and the architecture of public places. 19th-20th century Chicago architects included Burnham, Frederick Olmsted, Jens Jensen and Alfred Caldwell, modern projects include Millennium Park, Northerly Island, the 606, the Chicago Riverwalk, Maggie Daley Park, and proposals in Jackson Park.

==Residential architecture==
Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Prairie School influenced both building design and the design of furnishings. In the early half of the 20th century, popular residential neighborhoods were developed with Chicago Bungalow style houses, many of which still exist. The two-flat apartment building, along with the larger three- and six-flat buildings, make up 30% of Chicago&#x27;s housing stock. A two-flat includes two apartments, each of which occupies a full floor, usually with a large bay window and with a grey stone or red brick facade. The apartments typically have the same layout with a large living and dining room area at the front, the kitchen at the back and the bedrooms running down one side of the unit.

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s Illinois Institute of Technology campus in Chicago influenced the later Modern or International style. Van der Rohe&#x27;s work is sometimes called the Second Chicago School.

==Preservation==
Many organizations, including Preservation Chicago and Landmarks Illinois, promote the preservation of historic neighborhoods and buildings in Chicago. Chicago has suffered from the same problems with sinking property values and urban decline as other major cities. Many historic structures have been threatened with demolition.

<text>In chemistry and biology, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive chemicals formed from diatomic oxygen (), water, and hydrogen peroxide. Some prominent ROS are hydroperoxide (H2O2), superoxide (O2−), hydroxyl radical (OH.), and singlet oxygen(1O2). ROS are pervasive because they are readily produced from O2, which is abundant. ROS are important in many ways, both beneficial and otherwise. ROS function as signals, that turn on and off biological functions. They are intermediates in the redox behavior of O2, which is central to fuel cells. ROS are central to the photodegradation of organic pollutants in the atmosphere. Most often however, ROS are discussed in a biological context, ranging from their effects on aging and their role in causing dangerous genetic mutations.

==Inventory of ROS==
ROS are not uniformly defined. All sources include superoxide, singlet oxygen, and hydroxyl radical. Hydrogen peroxide is not nearly as reactive as these species, but is readily activated and is thus included. Peroxynitrite and nitric oxide are reactive oxygen-containing species as well. 
* Hydroxyl radical () is generated by Fenton reaction of hydrogen peroxide with ferrous compounds and related reducing agents:
In its fleeting existence, the hydroxyl radical reacts rapidly irreversibly with all organic compounds.
* superoxide () is produced by reduction of O2. Several grams are produced per day in the human body within the mitochondria.
Competing with its formation, superoxide is destroyed by the action of superoxide dismutases, enzymes that catalyze its disproportionation:
* hydrogen peroxide () is also produced as a side product of respiration.
* Peroxynitrite () results from the reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide.
* Singlet oxygen () is sometimes included as an ROS. Photosensitizers such as chlorophyll may convert triplet () to singlet oxygen: Singlet oxygen is highly reactive with unsaturated organic compounds. Carotenoids, tocopherols, and plastoquinones contained in chloroplasts quench singlet oxygen and protect against its toxic effects. Oxidized products of β-carotene arising from the presence of singlet oxygen act as second messengers that can either protect against singlet oxygen induced toxicity or initiate programmed cell death. Levels of jasmonate play a key role in the decision between cell acclimation or cell death in response to elevated levels of this reactive oxygen species.

==Biological function==
In a biological context, ROS are byproducts of the normal metabolism of oxygen. ROS have roles in cell signaling and homeostasis. ROS are intrinsic to cellular functioning, and are present at low and stationary levels in normal cells. In plants, ROS are involved in metabolic processes related to photoprotection and tolerance to various types of stress. However, ROS can cause irreversible damage to DNA as they oxidize and modify some cellular components and prevent them from performing their original functions. This suggests that ROS has a dual role; whether they will act as harmful, protective or signaling factors depends on the balance between ROS production and disposal at the right time and place. In other words, oxygen toxicity can arise both from uncontrolled production and from the inefficient elimination of ROS by the antioxidant system. ROS were also demonstrated to modify the visual appearance of fish. This potentially affects their behavior and ecology, such as their temperature control, their visual communication, their reproduction and survival.
During times of environmental stress (e.g., UV or heat exposure), ROS levels can increase dramatically. This may result in significant damage to cell structures. Cumulatively, this is known as oxidative stress. The production of ROS is strongly influenced by stress factor responses in plants, these factors that increase ROS production include drought, salinity, chilling, defense of pathogens, nutrient deficiency, metal toxicity and UV-B radiation. ROS are also generated by exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation generating irreversible effects in the development of tissues in both animals and plants.

==Sources of ROS production==
===Endogenous sources===
ROS are produced during the processes of respiration and photosynthesis in organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes and chloroplasts. During the respiration process the mitochondria convert energy for the cell into a usable form, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process of ATP production in the mitochondria, called oxidative phosphorylation, involves the transport of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane by means of the electron transport chain. In the electron transport chain, electrons are passed through a series of proteins via oxidation-reduction reactions, with each acceptor protein along the chain having a greater reduction potential than the previous. The last destination for an electron along this chain is an oxygen molecule. In normal conditions, the oxygen is reduced to produce water; however, in about 0.1–2% of electrons passing through the chain (this number derives from studies in isolated mitochondria, though the exact rate in live organisms is yet to be fully agreed upon), oxygen is instead prematurely and incompletely reduced to give the superoxide radical (•), most well documented for Complex I and Complex III.

Another source of ROS production in animal cells is the electron transfer reactions catalyzed by the mitochondrial P450 systems in steroidogenic tissues.
These P450 systems are dependent on the transfer of electrons from NADPH to P450. During this process, some electrons &quot;leak&quot; and react with O2 producing superoxide. To cope with this natural source of ROS, the steroidogenic tissues, ovary and testis, have a large concentration of antioxidants such as vitamin C (ascorbate) and β-carotene and anti-oxidant enzymes.

If too much damage is present in mitochondria, a cell undergoes apoptosis or programmed cell death.

In addition, ROS are produced in immune cell signaling via the NOX pathway. Phagocytic cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear phagocytes produce ROS when stimulated.

In chloroplasts, the carboxylation and oxygenation reactions catalyzed by rubisco ensure that the functioning of the electron transport chain (ETC) occurs in an environment rich in O2. The leakage of electrons in the ETC will inevitably produce ROS within the chloroplasts.
ETC in photosystem I (PSI) was once believed to be the only source of ROS in chloroplasts. The flow of electrons from the excited reaction centers is directed to the NADP and these are reduced to NADPH, and then they enter the Calvin cycle and reduce the final electron acceptor, CO2. In cases where there is an ETC overload, part of the electron flow is diverted from ferredoxin to O2, forming the superoxide free radical (by the Mehler reaction). In addition, electron leakage to O2 can also occur from the 2Fe-2S and 4Fe-4S clusters in the PSI ETC. However, PSII also provides electron leakage locations (QA, QB) for O2-producing O2-. Superoxide (O2-) is generated from PSII, instead of PSI; QB is shown as the location for the generation of O2•-.

===Exogenous sources===
The formation of ROS can be stimulated by a variety of agents such as pollutants, heavy metals, tobacco, smoke, drugs, xenobiotics, microplastics, or radiation. In plants, in addition to the action of dry abiotic factors, high temperature, interaction with other living beings can influence the production of ROS.

Ionizing radiation can generate damaging intermediates through the interaction with water, a process termed radiolysis. Since water comprises 55–60% of the human body, the probability of radiolysis is quite high under the presence of ionizing radiation. In the process, water loses an electron and becomes highly reactive. Then through a three-step chain reaction, water is sequentially converted to hydroxyl radical (•OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (•), and ultimately oxygen (O2).

The hydroxyl radical is extremely reactive and immediately removes electrons from any molecule in its path, turning that molecule into a free radical and thus propagating a chain reaction. However, hydrogen peroxide is actually more damaging to DNA than the hydroxyl radical, since the lower reactivity of hydrogen peroxide provides enough time for the molecule to travel into the nucleus of the cell, subsequently reacting with macromolecules such as DNA.

In plants, the production of ROS occurs during events of abiotic stress that lead to a reduction or interruption of metabolic activity. For example, the increase in temperature, drought are factors that limit the availability of CO2 due to stomatal closure, increasing the production of ROS, such as O2·- and 1O2 in chloroplasts. The production of 1O2 in chloroplasts can cause reprogramming of the expression of nucleus genes leading to chlorosis and programmed cell death.
In cases of biotic stress, the generation of ROS occurs quickly and weakly initially and then becomes more solid and lasting. The first phase of ROS accumulation is associated with plant infection and is probably independent of the synthesis of new ROS-generating enzymes. However, the second phase of ROS accumulation is associated only with infection by non-virulent pathogens and is an induced response dependent on increased mRNA transcription encoding enzymes.

==Antioxidant enzymes==

===Superoxide dismutase===

Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a class of enzymes that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. As such, they are an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. In mammals and most chordates, three forms of superoxide dismutase are present. SOD1 is located primarily in the cytoplasm, SOD2 in the mitochondria and SOD3 is extracellular. The first is a dimer (consists of two units), while the others are tetramers (four subunits). SOD1 and SOD3 contain copper and zinc ions, while SOD2 has a manganese ion in its reactive centre. The genes are located on chromosomes 21, 6, and 4, respectively (21q22.1, 6q25.3 and 4p15.3-p15.1).

The SOD-catalysed dismutation of superoxide may be written with the following half-reactions:
:formula_1

where M = Cu (); Mn (); Fe (); Ni (). In this reaction the oxidation state of the metal cation oscillates between and .

Catalase, which is concentrated in peroxisomes located next to mitochondria, reacts with the hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the formation of water and oxygen. Glutathione peroxidase reduces hydrogen peroxide by transferring the energy of the reactive peroxides to a sulfur-containing tripeptide called glutathione. The sulfur contained in these enzymes acts as the reactive center, carrying reactive electrons from the peroxide to the glutathione. Peroxiredoxins also degrade , within the mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus.

:formula_2

==Damaging effects==

Effects of ROS on cell metabolism are well documented in a variety of species. These include not only roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death) but also positive effects such as the induction of host defence genes and mobilization of ion transporters. This implicates them in control of cellular function. In particular, platelets involved in wound repair and blood homeostasis release ROS to recruit additional platelets to sites of injury. These also provide a link to the adaptive immune system via the recruitment of leukocytes.

Reactive oxygen species are implicated in cellular activity to a variety of inflammatory responses including cardiovascular disease. They may also be involved in hearing impairment via cochlear damage induced by elevated sound levels, in ototoxicity of drugs such as cisplatin, and in congenital deafness in both animals and humans. ROS are also implicated in mediation of apoptosis or programmed cell death and ischaemic injury. Specific examples include stroke and heart attack.

In general, the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species on the cell are the damage of DNA or RNA, oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids (lipid peroxidation), oxidation of amino acids in proteins, and oxidative deactivation of specific enzymes by oxidation co-factors.

===Pathogen response===
When a plant recognizes an attacking pathogen, one of the first induced reactions is to rapidly produce superoxide () or hydrogen peroxide () to strengthen the cell wall. This prevents the spread of the pathogen to other parts of the plant, essentially forming a net around the pathogen to restrict movement and reproduction.

In the mammalian host, ROS is induced as an antimicrobial defense. To highlight the importance of this defense, individuals with chronic granulomatous disease who have deficiencies in generating ROS, are highly susceptible to infection by a broad range of microbes including &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;, and &quot;Aspergillus&quot; spp.

Studies on the homeostasis of the &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;&#x27;s intestines have shown the production of ROS as a key component of the immune response in the gut of the fly. ROS acts both as a bactericide, damaging the bacterial DNA, RNA and proteins, as well as a signalling molecule that induces repair mechanisms of the epithelium. The uracil released by microorganism triggers the production and activity of DUOX, the ROS-producing enzyme in the intestine. DUOX activity is induced according to the level of uracil in the gut; under basal conditions, it is down-regulated by the protein kinase MkP3. The tight regulation of DUOX avoids excessive production of ROS and facilitates differentiation between benign and damage-inducing microorganisms in the gut.

The manner in which ROS defends the host from invading microbe is not fully understood. One of the more likely modes of defense is damage to microbial DNA. Studies using &quot;Salmonella&quot; demonstrated that DNA repair mechanisms were required to resist killing by ROS. A role for ROS in antiviral defense mechanisms has been demonstrated via Rig-like helicase-1 and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Increased levels of ROS potentiate signaling through this mitochondria-associated antiviral receptor to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), resulting in an antiviral state. Respiratory epithelial cells induce mitochondrial ROS in response to influenza infection. This induction of ROS led to the induction of type III interferon and the induction of an antiviral state, limiting viral replication. In host defense against mycobacteria, ROS play a role, although direct killing is likely not the key mechanism; rather, ROS likely affect ROS-dependent signalling controls, such as cytokine production, autophagy, and granuloma formation.

Reactive oxygen species are also implicated in activation, anergy and apoptosis of T cells.

===Oxidative damage===
In aerobic organisms the energy needed to fuel biological functions is produced in the mitochondria via the electron transport chain. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the potential to cause cellular damage are produced along with the release of energy. ROS can damage lipids, DNA, RNA, and proteins, which, in theory, contributes to the physiology of aging.

ROS are produced as a normal product of cellular metabolism. In particular, one major contributor to oxidative damage is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is converted from superoxide that leaks from the mitochondria. Catalase and superoxide dismutase ameliorate the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively, by converting these compounds into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (which is later converted to water), resulting in the production of benign molecules. However, this conversion is not 100% efficient, and residual peroxides persist in the cell. While ROS are produced as a product of normal cellular functioning, excessive amounts can cause deleterious effects.

===Impairment of cognitive function===
Memory capabilities decline with age, evident in human degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism&#x27;s fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of oxidative damage and its implications for aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.

==Cause of aging==
According to the free radical theory of aging, oxidative damage initiated by reactive oxygen species is a major contributor to the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (as one would expect from the theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in &quot;Drosophila&quot; do show that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes). Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;.

In mice, the story is somewhat similar. Deleting antioxidant enzymes, in general, yields shorter lifespan, although overexpression studies have not (with some exceptions) consistently extended lifespan. Study of a rat model of premature aging found increased oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant enzyme activity and substantially greater DNA damage in the brain neocortex and hippocampus of the prematurely aged rats than in normally aging control rats. The DNA damage 8-OHdG is a product of ROS interaction with DNA. Numerous studies have shown that 8-OHdG increases with age (see DNA damage theory of aging).

==Cancer==
ROS are constantly generated and eliminated in the biological system and are required to drive regulatory pathways. Under normal physiological conditions, cells control ROS levels by balancing the generation of ROS with their elimination by scavenging systems. But under oxidative stress conditions, excessive ROS can damage cellular proteins, lipids and DNA, leading to fatal lesions in the cell that contribute to carcinogenesis.

Cancer cells exhibit greater ROS stress than normal cells do, partly due to oncogenic stimulation, increased metabolic activity and mitochondrial malfunction. ROS is a double-edged sword. On one hand, at low levels, ROS facilitates cancer cell survival since cell-cycle progression driven by growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) require ROS for activation and chronic inflammation, a major mediator of cancer, is regulated by ROS. On the other hand, a high level of ROS can suppress tumor growth through the sustained activation of cell-cycle inhibitor and induction of cell death as well as senescence by damaging macromolecules. In fact, most of the chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells by augmenting ROS stress. The ability of cancer cells to distinguish between ROS as a survival or apoptotic signal is controlled by the dosage, duration, type, and site of ROS production. Modest levels of ROS are required for cancer cells to survive, whereas excessive levels kill them.

Metabolic adaptation in tumours balances the cells&#x27; need for energy with equally important need for macromolecular building blocks and tighter control of redox balance. As a result, production of NADPH is greatly enhanced, which functions as a cofactor to provide reducing power in many enzymatic reactions for macromolecular biosynthesis and at the same time rescuing the cells from excessive ROS produced during rapid proliferation. Cells counterbalance the detrimental effects of ROS by producing antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (TRX), which rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their activities.

Most risk factors associated with cancer interact with cells through the generation of ROS. ROS then activate various transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), leading to expression of proteins that control inflammation; cellular transformation; tumor cell survival; tumor cell proliferation; and invasion, angiogenesis as well as metastasis. And ROS also control the expression of various tumor suppressor genes such as p53, retinoblastoma gene (Rb), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).

===Carcinogenesis===
ROS-related oxidation of DNA is one of the main causes of mutations, which can produce several types of DNA damage, including non-bulky (8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine) and bulky (cyclopurine and etheno adducts) base modifications, abasic sites, non-conventional single-strand breaks, protein-DNA adducts, and intra/interstrand DNA crosslinks. It has been estimated that endogenous ROS produced via normal cell metabolism modify approximately 20,000 bases of DNA per day in a single cell. 8-oxoguanine is the most abundant among various oxidized nitrogeneous bases observed. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase mispairs 8-oxoguanine with adenine, leading to a G→T transversion mutation. The resulting genomic instability directly contributes to carcinogenesis. Cellular transformation leads to cancer and interaction of atypical PKC-ζ isoform with p47phox controls ROS production and transformation from apoptotic cancer stem cells through blebbishield emergency program.

===Cell proliferation===
Uncontrolled proliferation is a hallmark of cancer cells. Both exogenous and endogenous ROS have been shown to enhance proliferation of cancer cells. The role of ROS in promoting tumor proliferation is further supported by the observation that agents with potential to inhibit ROS generation can also inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Although ROS can promote tumor cell proliferation, a great increase in ROS has been associated with reduced cancer cell proliferation by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest; increased phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1), Chk 2; and reduced cell division cycle 25 homolog c (CDC25).

===Cell death===
A cancer cell can die in three ways: apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Excessive ROS can induce apoptosis through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, ROS are generated by Fas ligand as an upstream event for Fas activation via phosphorylation, which is necessary for subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase 8 as well as apoptosis induction. In the intrinsic pathway, ROS function to facilitate cytochrome c release by activating pore-stabilizing proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) as well as inhibiting pore-destabilizing proteins (Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer). The intrinsic pathway is also known as the caspase cascade and is induced through mitochondrial damage which triggers the release of cytochrome c. DNA damage, oxidative stress, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential lead to the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins mentioned above stimulating apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage is closely linked to apoptosis and since mitochondria are easily targeted there is potential for cancer therapy.

The cytotoxic nature of ROS is a driving force behind apoptosis, but in even higher amounts, ROS can result in both apoptosis and necrosis, a form of uncontrolled cell death, in cancer cells.

Numerous studies have shown the pathways and associations between ROS levels and apoptosis, but a newer line of study has connected ROS levels and autophagy. ROS can also induce cell death through autophagy, which is a self-catabolic process involving sequestration of cytoplasmic contents (exhausted or damaged organelles and protein aggregates) for degradation in lysosomes. Therefore, autophagy can also regulate the cell&#x27;s health in times of oxidative stress. Autophagy can be induced by ROS levels through many pathways in the cell in an attempt to dispose of harmful organelles and prevent damage, such as carcinogens, without inducing apoptosis. Autophagic cell death can be prompted by the over expression of autophagy where the cell digests too much of itself in an attempt to minimize the damage and can no longer survive. When this type of cell death occurs, an increase or loss of control of autophagy regulating genes is commonly co-observed. Thus, once a more in-depth understanding of autophagic cell death is attained and its relation to ROS, this form of programmed cell death may serve as a future cancer therapy.
Autophagy and apoptosis are distinct mechanisms for cell death brought on by high levels of ROS. Aautophagy and apoptosis, however, rarely act through strictly independent pathways. There is a clear connection between ROS and autophagy and a correlation seen between excessive amounts of ROS leading to apoptosis. The depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is also characteristic of the initiation of autophagy. When mitochondria are damaged and begin to release ROS, autophagy is initiated to dispose of the damaging organelle. If a drug targets mitochondria and creates ROS, autophagy may dispose of so many mitochondria and other damaged organelles that the cell is no longer viable. The extensive amount of ROS and mitochondrial damage may also signal for apoptosis. The balance of autophagy within the cell and the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis mediated by ROS is crucial for a cell&#x27;s survival. This crosstalk and connection between autophagy and apoptosis could be a mechanism targeted by cancer therapies or used in combination therapies for highly resistant cancers.

===Tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis===
After growth factor stimulation of RTKs, ROS can trigger activation of signaling pathways involved in cell migration and invasion such as members of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family – extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun NH-2 terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. ROS can also promote migration by augmenting phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) p130Cas and paxilin.

Both in vitro and in vivo, ROS have been shown to induce transcription factors and modulate signaling molecules involved in angiogenesis (MMP, VEGF) and metastasis (upregulation of AP-1, CXCR4, AKT and downregulation of PTEN).

===Chronic inflammation and cancer===
Experimental and epidemiologic research over the past several years has indicated close associations among ROS, chronic inflammation, and cancer. ROS induces chronic inflammation by the induction of COX-2, inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6), chemokines (IL-8, CXCR4) and pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB). These chemokines and chemokine receptors, in turn, promote invasion and metastasis of various tumor types.

===Cancer therapy===
Both ROS-elevating and ROS-eliminating strategies have been developed with the former being predominantly used. Cancer cells with elevated ROS levels depend heavily on the antioxidant defense system. ROS-elevating drugs further increase cellular ROS stress level, either by direct ROS-generation (e.g. motexafin gadolinium, elesclomol) or by agents that abrogate the inherent antioxidant system such as SOD inhibitor (e.g. ATN-224, 2-methoxyestradiol) and GSH inhibitor (e.g. PEITC, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)). The result is an overall increase in endogenous ROS, which when above a cellular tolerability threshold, may induce cell death. On the other hand, normal cells appear to have, under lower basal stress and reserve, a higher capacity to cope with additional ROS-generating insults than cancer cells do. Therefore, the elevation of ROS in all cells can be used to achieve the selective killing of cancer cells.

Radiotherapy also relies on ROS toxicity to eradicate tumor cells. Radiotherapy uses X-rays, γ-rays as well as heavy particle radiation such as protons and neutrons to induce ROS-mediated cell death and mitotic failure.

Due to the dual role of ROS, both prooxidant and antioxidant-based anticancer agents have been developed. However, modulation of ROS signaling alone seems not to be an ideal approach due to adaptation of cancer cells to ROS stress, redundant pathways for supporting cancer growth and toxicity from ROS-generating anticancer drugs. Combinations of ROS-generating drugs with pharmaceuticals that can break the redox adaptation could be a better strategy for enhancing cancer cell cytotoxicity.

James Watson and others have proposed that lack of intracellular ROS due to a lack of physical exercise may contribute to the malignant progression of cancer, because spikes of ROS are needed to correctly fold proteins in the endoplasmatic reticulum and low ROS levels may thus aspecifically hamper the formation of tumor suppressor proteins. Since physical exercise induces temporary spikes of ROS, this may explain why physical exercise is beneficial for cancer patient prognosis. Moreover, high inducers of ROS such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose and carbohydrate-based inducers of cellular stress induce cancer cell death more potently because they exploit the cancer cell&#x27;s high avidity for sugars.
==Positive role of ROS in memory==

ROS are critical in memory formation. ROS also have a central role in epigenetic DNA demethylation, which is relevant to learning and memory

In mammalian nuclear DNA, a methyl group can be added, by a DNA methyltransferase, to the 5th carbon of cytosine to form 5mC (see red methyl group added to form 5mC near the top of the first figure). The DNA methyltransferases most often form 5mC within the dinucleotide sequence &quot;cytosine-phosphate-guanine&quot; to form 5mCpG. This addition is a major type of epigenetic alteration and it can silence gene expression. Methylated cytosine can also be demethylated, an epigenetic alteration that can increase the expression of a gene. A major enzyme involved in demethylating 5mCpG is TET1. However, TET1 is only able to act on 5mCpG if an ROS has first acted on the guanine to form 8-hydroxy-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide . However, TET1 is only able to act on the 5mC part of the dinucleotide when the base excision repair enzyme OGG1 binds to the 8-OHdG lesion without immediate excision. Adherence of OGG1 to the 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits TET1 and TET1 then oxidizes the 5mC adjacent to 8-OHdG, as shown in the first figure, initiating a demethylation pathway shown in the second figure.

The thousands of CpG sites being demethylated during memory formation depend on ROS in an initial step. The altered protein expression in neurons, controlled in part by ROS-dependent demethylation of CpG sites in gene promoters within neuron DNA, are central to memory formation.

<text>Switchblade Symphony was an American gothic rock band from San Francisco, California. Their music combined orchestral sounds with heavy synth sequences and vocals to create a union of classical music and gothic rock.

== History ==
Switchblade Symphony was formed in 1989 by composer Susan Wallace and vocalist Tina Root. The band&#x27;s name refers to the cutting up elements of classical music to mix them with harder sounds.

They released their first album in 1995 on the Cleopatra Records label. They also had two live guitarists, first Robin Jacobs (who later joined Razor Skyline) and then George Earth (most recently of Small Halo, also with Tina Root), and three live drummers, first Eric Gebow (now with Blue Man Group), Justin Clayton, and then Scott van Shoick.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Bread and Jam for Frances&quot;, was released in 1997. The album peaked at #119 on the CMJ Radio Top 200.

Switchblade Symphony disbanded in November 1999. Subsequently, Tina Root started Tre Lux. In 2008, Tina Root and George Earth formed Small Halo, a band based out of Los Angeles, California.

Their song &quot;Clown&quot; was featured in the 1998 film &quot;Wicked&quot; starring Julia Stiles. Their song &quot;Gutter Glitter&quot; was also featured in an episode of &quot;The Boulet Brothers&#x27; Dragula&quot;.

<text>Charles Rodman Campbell (October 21, 1954 – May 27, 1994) was an American rapist and murderer from Washington State. He was executed by hanging in 1994 by the state of Washington for a 1982 triple murder he committed in Clearview, killing three female victims.

In 1974, Campbell attacked and sexually assaulted 23-year-old Renae Wicklund, leading to his apprehension in 1976. After Wicklund and her neighbor, Barbara Hendrickson, testified against him, Campbell was convicted of first-degree assault and sodomy and received a sentence of 40 years in prison. Authorities did not make Wicklund aware of the fact that Campbell&#x27;s sentence would allow him to be placed in a work release program after serving seven years behind bars despite Campbell being accused of multiple disciplinary infractions while serving his 40-year sentence, including the rape of at least two other inmates and the physical assault of a third; in 1981, he was placed in a work release facility under conditions that allowed him more freedom of movement outside of prison, unbeknownst to Wicklund.

On April 14, 1982, months after Campbell&#x27;s placement in his work release program, he revisited and burglarized the Wicklund house, where then-31-year-old Renae Wicklund, her nine-year-old daughter Shannah, and 51-year-old Hendrickson were present, and murdered and mutilated all three of them. Campbell&#x27;s motive for returning to Wicklund&#x27;s home to further victimize her was revenge due to her and Hendrickson having testified against him during his trial for Wicklund&#x27;s rape. Following his arrest, trial, and conviction, Campbell was executed by hanging, becoming one of only three people executed by hanging in the United States since 1976.

In 2023, DNA tests posthumously linked Campbell to a separate sexual assault and murder of a woman in 1975.

== Early life and background ==
Campbell was born on October 21, 1954, in Oahu, Hawaii. Campbell&#x27;s father was a former Marine, and both of his parents were heavy drinkers. He stated that he watched his father commit domestic violence against his mother frequently. Despite his father&#x27;s domestic violence, Campbell stated in a 1982 psychological report that he admired his father and thought of his mother as weak and excessively disciplinary. Campbell began drinking and using drugs, including amphetamines and heroin, by the time he was 13 years old.

On October 29, 1970, eight days after his 16th birthday, Campbell&#x27;s father reported him to the police in Edmonds, Washington, for stealing the family car. In July 1971, Campbell&#x27;s mother reported him as a runaway but stated that she &quot;[had] given up hope for [Campbell] except for trying to get him to court. She would not bother reporting him gone and would just as soon that he never came back home.&quot; The next day, he burglarized his grandparents&#x27; home and was promptly arrested after stealing several guns to finance a trip to California.

The theft of his grandparents&#x27; guns led to his incarceration at the Green Hill School in Chehalis, Washington approximately between 1971 and 1972. School employees considered him unruly at times but &quot;nondescript,&quot; as several of the facility&#x27;s employees had little recollection of Campbell when interviewed about him shortly before his execution. One of his prior instructors stated that he was the kind of student who &quot;just falls between the cracks&quot;. Bob Williams, the superintendent of Green Hill School, recalled Campbell was &quot;a real cold-blooded person&quot; who &quot;promised that he would try to hurt anybody that came around him&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s stint in the youth detention facility was apparently intended to address antisocial tendencies.

In August 1973, after his stint at the Green Hill School ended, Campbell married. He subjected his wife to domestic violence and threatened to kill several members of her family as well as her dog. In March 1974, Campbell and his wife had a daughter; on one occasion in June 1974, when their daughter was three months old, Campbell grew irate at her crying and threw a butcher knife at her. In August 1974, Campbell and his wife divorced, and his wife gained custody of their daughter.

When Campbell was 23 years old, the Washington State Division of Juvenile Rehabilitation purged his juvenile crime records.

==Initial crimes against Renae Wicklund==

On December 11, 1974, Campbell attacked then-23-year-old Renae Wicklund while she was doing yard work outside her home in Clearview, Washington. He demanded that she perform oral sex on him at knifepoint, threatening to kill her infant daughter, Shannah, if she did not comply. Wicklund submitted to his demands. After he completed the rape and left, Wicklund called police. Campbell was not apprehended until 1976, when she picked him out of a police line-up.

Campbell faced trial in spring 1976, and he pleaded not guilty. During Campbell&#x27;s trial, Wicklund and her neighbor, Barbara Hendrickson, testified in detail about the assault; Hendrickson attested to Wicklund&#x27;s psychological state following the assault. A jury convicted Campbell of first-degree assault and sodomy in April. On May 11, 1976, Campbell began serving three concurrent sentences, totaling 40 years, for the assault and sodomy of Wicklund as well as an unrelated 1976 burglary. Wicklund was not alerted to the fact that Campbell&#x27;s sentences ran concurrently, not consecutively, meaning that he could theoretically have been paroled in significantly fewer than 40 years.

During the intervening years, Wicklund had separated from her husband, Jack, due to the lingering stress of the assault and devoted herself to raising her daughter, supporting herself and Shannah with an in-home business as an accountant for local beauty parlors, as well as helping students obtain loans for beautician school. Jack Wicklund, meanwhile, fell victim to a bizarre incident in December 1977, when he was found tied to a chair in his West Seattle home with massive third-degree burns. After receiving medical treatment, he said that a complete stranger visited his house, tied him up, doused him with gasoline, and set him on fire. Wicklund was required to wear a rubber bodysuit to protect his damaged skin. Five months later, he died when his car crashed into a tree. The exact circumstances surrounding Jack Wicklund&#x27;s death are unclear, and police never satisfactorily determined whether he had been murdered or had died by suicide.

=== Imprisonment and work release ===
During his stint serving his concurrent sentences in the Washington State Reformatory, Campbell accumulated several disciplinary infractions, including possessing a homemade liquor he illicitly brewed using stolen yeast, physically assaulting other inmates, raping at least two fellow inmates and threatening to murder one of the victims if he reported the rape, physically assaulting an inmate to the point of that inmate needing to receive treatment for head injuries, conjuring homemade liquor from yeast Campbell stole from the prison&#x27;s kitchen, and having a sexual relationship with a prison substance abuse counselor, who would later give birth to a son by Campbell in October 1982; the counselor was fired for her illicit relationship with Campbell. In January 1979, a prison psychologist completed a psychological review of Campbell, concluding that Campbell was drawn to conflict, exhibited multiple antisocial tendencies, had no regard for others, and &quot;[had] declared war on society, all of whom he regards as mindless nitwits who are getting theirs and are now out to get him.&quot; The psychological review also stated Campbell was &quot;[blithely] uncaring of others, conscienceless, malevolently intolerable of the social order which imprisons him, and [was] imminently harmful to all who directly or indirectly capture his attention or interest&quot;.

Despite his prison disciplinary infractions and his psychological report, in June 1981, the Washington State Parole Board waived Campbell&#x27;s mandatory sentence, thus making him eligible to be downgraded to minimum-custody status as he awaited a May 1983 parole hearing date. In October 1981, Campbell was placed in a work release facility in Monroe, Washington. Sometime between December 25, 1981, and January 4, 1982, Campbell&#x27;s ex-wife accused him of temporarily leaving his work release to rape her. Following the closure of his original work release program in Monroe, Campbell was transferred to another program in Everett, Washington, on February 24, 1982, where he committed four additional disciplinary infractions in his first 30 days.

== Triple murders ==
On April 14, 1982, then-31-year-old Renae Wicklund was sick at her home in Clearview, and her nine-year-old daughter Shannah was with her. Her neighbor, then-51-year-old Barbara Hendrickson, visited the home at approximately 4:20 pm to tend to Wicklund and check her vital signs. Two hours later, at 6:30 pm, Hendrickson&#x27;s husband Donald visited Wicklund&#x27;s home to check on his wife and discovered the dead bodies of all three victims in different rooms of the house. Campbell beat and assaulted all three victims before murdering them. He tore Renae&#x27;s and Hendrickson&#x27;s earlobes to steal their earrings. He severely beat Renae across the head, back, and upper chest, broke her jaw and nose, strangled her, raped her with a blunt object, and cut her throat, severing her carotid arteries; her official cause of death was exsanguination from the cut to her throat. Campbell also strangled Shannah and cut her neck so deeply, that he nearly decapitated her; her blood loss was extensive enough to make it difficult for investigators to obtain a sample of her blood. Campbell cut Hendrickson&#x27;s throat as well. The same day of the murders, Campbell also tried to rape another woman.

A neighbor of Wicklund&#x27;s told police she saw Campbell sneaking around Wicklund&#x27;s yard with a knife that morning, and other neighbors observed him heading towards the house with a large blanket roll in his hands. After investigating the crime scene, investigators found a drinking glass with a bloody handprint on it which matched Campbell&#x27;s fingerprints; Campbell also left a trail of Renae Wicklund&#x27;s jewelry running from the front door of the house down the walkway. Campbell&#x27;s car had dried blood on the driver&#x27;s side door handle, and Shannah&#x27;s earring was found in the back seat. Investigators found a pair of Renae&#x27;s earrings in Campbell&#x27;s pants pockets during his arrest. In addition, a fellow work release resident directed police to a location along the banks of the Snohomish River, where he and Campbell had been on the evening of April 14. There, diving units recovered several pieces of clothing, decoration, and jewelry, including pottery, other pairs of earrings, a bracelet, necklaces, a pair of jeans, and a shirt from the river. When questioned by police, Donald Hendrickson stated that &quot;the man who&#x27;d attacked Renae eight years earlier&quot; was the only possible perpetrator he could think of.

Campbell was arrested at the Monroe Reformatory on April 19, and charged with first degree murder. Held in the Snohomish County Jail, he was unpopular with other prisoners because he had murdered a child; additionally, the circumstances of his crime meant that stricter rules would be imposed on the freedoms of inmates on parole.

==Trial==

At Campbell&#x27;s November 1982 trial, he refused to testify in his defense or discuss the murders at all. Testifying for the prosecution were neighbors who had seen him sneaking around the house on the afternoon of April 14, and his girlfriend Judy Dirks, who said that on the morning of the killings, he&#x27;d been at her home, where he consumed an entire six pack of beer. The next day, she noticed one of her kitchen knives was missing. Dirks testified that Campbell had &quot;considerable resentment&quot; towards Renae Wicklund and had driven past her home a couple of times while on work release. Campbell took the unusual step of cross-examining his girlfriend himself, and got her to admit that he had never told her he wanted to harm Renae Wicklund.

The defense did not call any witnesses or present any evidence other than that the case was a miscarriage of justice because investigators immediately focused on Campbell and did not search for any other potential suspects. Numerous citizens of Clearview had signed a petition demanding the death penalty for him, and the jury agreed, arguing that he showed no signs whatsoever of remorse for killing the Wicklunds and Barbara Hendrickson. During the trial, Campbell remained for the most part detached, and said little. Even the crime scene and autopsy photos (see below) did not arouse much noticeable emotion in him. Renae Wicklund&#x27;s mother and sister, who lived in North Dakota, were particularly shocked by the murders because she had never told them about being raped eight years earlier.

During the trial, Campbell&#x27;s attorneys argued that he could not be charged with rape, since the wound in Renae Wicklund&#x27;s vagina was a post-mortem injury that had not bled. Snohomish County Coroner Dr. Clayton Haberman, who performed the autopsies, pointed out that brain death does not occur until a few minutes after circulation ceases, and she could technically have still been alive when the assault happened, but it may just as easily have been hours later. He also noted that Shannah lost so much blood that it was difficult to collect a sample from her. Judge Dennis Britt thus ordered the jury to disregard the rape allegations. The defense also protested the prosecution&#x27;s decision to display graphic autopsy photos of the Wicklunds and Barbara Hendrickson. Judge Britt allowed this, but said that the jurors could decide for themselves whether they wanted to see their blood-splattered clothing.

Because the only living witness to the murders would not speak of or recount what happened, investigators had to roughly piece together the sequence of events on April 14. Renae Wicklund had obviously been attacked first. Shannah was found lying in the bedroom next to her, and it was believed that Campbell may have shown the girl her mother&#x27;s lifeless body prior to slitting her throat. They were probably both dead by the time Barbara Hendrickson entered the home. Knocked-over furniture in the living room indicated that she could have run into Campbell and attempted to flee, but was caught. The bodies were all positioned in such a way that &quot;the effect seems to have been to intentionally shock whoever came across them&quot;.

On November 26, 1982, Campbell was convicted of the three murders of Renae Wicklund, Shannah Wicklund, and Barbara Hendrickson. On December 17, 1982, he was sentenced to death.

==Incarceration and appeals==
=== Incarceration ===
In 1985, a still more damning report emerged alleging that Monroe Reformatory staff had not only covered up for Campbell, but were actively conspiring with him. Inmate counselor Roger Button kept certain inmates on his &quot;payroll&quot;, which included Charles Campbell. The inmates supplied Button with sexual favors in exchange for his covering up their prison infractions; and in addition, he used them as extortion agents to beat up prisoners he disliked, collect debts, or protect prisoners he did like. Button denied all of these allegations.

While his case was at various stages of appeal, he remained a much-feared figure in Walla Walla&#x27;s death row for the next decade, even spitting at then-Governor Booth Gardner when he peered into his cell.

While Campbell was on death row, his mother stated that she still loved Campbell but supported his death sentence. Campbell&#x27;s mother claimed that he had sex with a pet dog that he adopted, and after learning of his arrest for first-degree murder told investigators that, &quot;It was inevitable. I never believed he was going to end up anywhere but the electric chair.&quot; His father and sisters could not be located. Campbell&#x27;s mother died before his execution was carried out.

In a 1982 psychological report by Charles P. Tappin, a Seattle-based psychiatrist, Tappin confirmed that Campbell did not exhibit signs of brain damage but had an &quot;unorthodox&quot; antisocial view of reality. Campbell was quoted in the report as saying, &quot;The world has created me, and I am free to do what I want. There is no right or wrong, or anyone to tell me what to do.&quot;

Campbell rejected most offers for interviews during his stay on death row, choosing instead to dedicate most of his time on death row to his appeals.

=== Appeals ===
On November 6, 1984, the Washington Supreme Court upheld Campbell&#x27;s conviction and death sentence, and on January 21, 1985, Campbell&#x27;s first death warrant was signed, scheduling his execution to take place on March 29, 1985. Two weeks before that execution date, Campbell received a stay of execution because he had not yet completed his appeals. On April 29, 1985, the Supreme Court of the United States rejected one of Campbell&#x27;s petitions for appeal, and on May 17, a second death warrant was signed, scheduling his execution for July 25, 1985. One week prior, the Washington Supreme Court denied Campbell&#x27;s request for a stay and appeal, but on July 22, a federal district court granted an indefinite stay of execution.

On October 6, 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied another of Campbell&#x27;s appeal petitions, but they did not lift his stay of execution until January 25, 1989. In the meantime, on November 7, 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Campbell&#x27;s case. On February 15, 1989, Campbell had a third death warrant signed, scheduling his execution for March 30, 1989. Only 33 hours before that date of execution, Campbell received a stay of execution from the Ninth Circuit Court, with them citing that Campbell had several remaining appeals. On September 13, 1991, Campbell filed a third federal appeal, which was dismissed by a U.S. District Court on March 9, 1992.

On April 28, 1993, Campbell filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court arguing that hanging violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it was cruel and unusual punishment; in this appeal, Campbell also argued it was unconstitutionally cruel to make inmates choose a method of execution or to encourage inmates to choose a method of execution, arguing that Washington encouraged inmates to make a choice by making hanging their default method. On February 8, 1994, the Ninth Circuit Court denied Campbell&#x27;s appeal with a 6–5 ruling upholding the constitutionality of hanging as a method of execution; the ruling also determined that Washington was not in violation of the U.S. Constitution by having inmates choose their method of execution.

The 1989 stay of execution remained active until April 14, 1994, when the Ninth Circuit Court lifted the stay; the next day, April 15, Campbell&#x27;s fourth and final death warrant was signed, scheduling Campbell&#x27;s execution to take place on May 27, 1994.

== Execution ==

=== Last-minute clemency requests ===
Washington State offered its death row inmates the choice between execution by lethal injection or hanging, but at the time, hanging was the state&#x27;s default method of execution; inmates who refused to choose a method of execution would be hanged. Campbell refused to choose between the two, meaning his method of execution would, by default, be hanging.

Sometime before his execution, Campbell wrote a letter to Washington Governor Mike Lowry to request a face-to-face meeting, calling himself a &quot;victim&quot; as well as a defendant and asking Lowry to observe &quot;[Campbell&#x27;s] sincerity, candor, and demeanor,&quot; but Lowry declined to meet with Campbell.

On May 24, 1994, three days prior to Campbell&#x27;s execution, the state clemency board unanimously refused Campbell&#x27;s plea for mercy in a 4–0 vote, with one member abstaining. Despite rejecting Campbell&#x27;s offer for a meeting earlier, on the night of May 24, Lowry made the unprecedented decision to hold a private meeting with Campbell in a section of Washington State&#x27;s death row. His meeting with Campbell lasted approximately 30 minutes. Lowry&#x27;s press secretary characterized the meeting as &quot;Mr. Campbell&#x27;s opportunity&quot; to advocate for the commutation of his sentence to life without parole. Lowry also met with relatives of Campbell&#x27;s victims, as well as a separate group of death penalty opponents, prior to making his final decision regarding Campbell&#x27;s fate. Lowry&#x27;s office reported receiving an overwhelming amount of letters from members of the public who were in support of Campbell&#x27;s execution, 3,789 letters, compared to 532 letters in opposition. Lowry was personally opposed to capital punishment and had the power under Washington State law to grant clemency and pardons without requiring a recommendation from the state&#x27;s clemency board, but one of his spokespeople stated that Lowry would deal with pending executions on a case-by-case basis. After completing the meetings and reviewing the evidence in Campbell&#x27;s case, Lowry issued a short statement confirming he would not interfere in Campbell&#x27;s case, allowing the execution to proceed.

Shortly before Campbell&#x27;s execution, officials recorded Campbell&#x27;s weight at 220 pounds. Officials determined that a rope permitting a five-foot drop would be sufficient to successfully break Campbell&#x27;s neck during his hanging. Campbell&#x27;s drop of five feet was the minimum allowed in the U.S. Army manual that Washington officials consulted when crafting their hanging protocol. Twenty-four hours before the execution, Campbell was given his last shower. The day prior to his execution, Campbell was non-compliant when officers went to transport him to a holding cell near the execution chamber. Officers found him faint, lying on the floor of his cell, and ultimately subdued him using pepper spray. Later, while cleaning out Campbell&#x27;s former cell, authorities found a four-inch piece of metal that he had been sharpening into a knife.

Officials served Campbell his last meal, a fish dinner, two hours before the hanging took place, and he refused to eat most of it. Campbell spent his final hours visiting and talking to friends and relatives, including an attorney, his son, and the ex-prison counselor with whom he had his son.

=== Execution ===
Witnesses to Campbell&#x27;s execution included twelve reporters affiliated with various media outlets, three relatives of the victims&#x27; families, the Snohomish County Prosecutor, and Campbell&#x27;s attorney. Authorities had to forcibly strap Campbell to a board in order to execute him, stating that he had trouble walking and standing on his own. Guards carried Campbell to the gallows strapped rigidly to the board. Campbell then repeatedly moved his head, giving prison officials difficulty in placing a hood over his head before the trap door was opened. Officials sprung the trap door at 12:08 am, and he was pronounced dead six minutes later, at 12:14 am. Witnesses described the execution as &quot;fast and clinical&quot; and said that following his drop from the trap door, Campbell did not move at all. Campbell&#x27;s was the second hanging in both Washington and the United States as a whole in two years, after serial child killer Westley Allan Dodd, and Campbell&#x27;s execution was also the first involuntary execution in Washington in over 33 years, after the hanging of convicted murderer Joseph Chester Self in 1960.

Following Campbell&#x27;s hanging, the King County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office conducted an autopsy on his remains. Medical Examiner Donald Reay determined Campbell experienced a broken neck and broken spinal cord following his drop from the gallows&#x27; trap door, and Reay also found that Campbell died seconds after the drop. After his execution, no one stepped forward to claim his remains, so Walla Walla County officials cremated his body, although his girlfriend and son later claimed his remains, as well as Campbell&#x27;s remaining personal affects, on May 31, as Campbell had requested before his execution.

== Aftermath ==
The triple murders sparked legislative changes in Washington State, namely the passage of laws strengthening and broadening the state&#x27;s death penalty, allowing for its application in a wider set of circumstances.

In the aftermath of the trial, there were numerous lawsuits. His ex-wife sued the State of Washington for negligence in allowing him to go free on work release and rape her two times. Hilda Ahlers filed a lawsuit seeking damages for the same negligence that led to the death of her daughter and granddaughter. The state also agreed to pay Don Hendrickson $950,000 in damages.

In 1996, Washington legislators made lethal injection the state&#x27;s default method of execution. In 2018, the Washington Supreme Court declared the state&#x27;s death penalty was unconstitutional, effectively abolishing capital punishment in the state and likely making Campbell the last person to be executed by hanging in the state.

In 2023, DNA evidence showed that Campbell was likely responsible for the murder of University of Washington student Hallie Ann Seaman, whose murder has previously been unsolved. On April 29, 1975, Seaman had been sexually assaulted and stabbed to death, and her murderer, likely Campbell, moved her car four miles from the location where a passerby would discover her body the next day; Campbell also likely set the car on fire.

<doc id="640709" wikidata="Q1419023" url="?curid=640709" title="Firestorm (character)">
<text>Firestorm is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He was created by Gerry Conway and Al Milgrom. [[Ronnie Raymond]] and [[Martin Stein]] first fused together to become Firestorm in &quot;Firestorm, the Nuclear Man&quot; #1 (March 1978). [[Jason Rusch]] debuted as a modern update of the character in &quot;Firestorm&quot; (vol. 3) #1 (July 2004), and was created by Dan Jolley and ChrisCross.

Firestorm was featured in The CW&#x27;s &quot;Arrowverse&quot;, portrayed by Robbie Amell, Victor Garber, and Franz Drameh (as [[Firestorm (character)|Jefferson Jackson]]) mainly in &quot;The Flash&quot; and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. 

==Creation==
In an interview Conway discussed his reasoning and influences while creating the character &quot;I always loved the idea of the hair on fire, I think it goes back to Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, an entire flaming character, of course.&quot; Conway further elaborated, &quot;I&#x27;d been playing around with the idea of a teenage superhero for DC, who could sort of fill the hole that had been left in my heart by leaving Spider-Man behind. I&#x27;d been thinking about the tropes — one of which was the meek, mild alter ego, the brainy kid who, in wish fulfillment, gets superpowers, is extremely powerful… able to do things that he hadn&#x27;t been able to do before. That was, I think, the major motivating force—I wanted to play on that trope.
To do that, I wanted to flip it around: create a guy who wasn&#x27;t the brightest guy in the room, the not-terribly-smart guy who became a superpowered character. The way I&#x27;d make that work: I&#x27;d bring him into contact with the smarter person, who would also share the powers. This led to… the multiple-people-in-one, Professor Stein/ Ronnie Raymond dynamic.&quot;

Jack Kirby&#x27;s design for Lightray&#x27;s costume influenced the look of artist Al Milgrom&#x27;s creation of Firestorm. In an interview from 2019, Milgrom admitted: &quot;The facemask on Firestorm, the way it comes around the chin, was probably inspired by Lightray more than anything... I liked the [Lightray] head-covering thing; I said, &quot;I&#x27;m stealin&#x27; it!&quot;.

==Publication history==
The first &quot;Firestorm&quot; series was short-lived, canceled after issue 5, a victim of the company-wide &quot;DC Implosion&quot;. The sixth issue was included in &quot;Cancelled Comic Cavalcade&quot;. 

Writer Gerry Conway added Firestorm to the roster of &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. This led to a series of eight-page stories in the back of &quot;The Flash&quot; (issues 289–304; with art by George Pérez, Jim Starlin and others), and a revival of a monthly Firestorm comic in 1982. &quot;The Fury of Firestorm&quot; (later called &quot;Firestorm the Nuclear Man&quot;) lasted from 1982 until 1990.

Firestorm (vol. 3) ran from 2004 to 2007, and introduced the second Firestorm, Jason Rusch, following Ronnie Raymond&#x27;s death in &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;.

&quot;The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men&quot;, a series starring Raymond and Rusch, ran from 2012 to 2013 as part of &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot. It was initially written by Gail Simone and Ethan Van Sciver and drawn by Yıldıray Çınar. Joe Harris replaced Simone starting in issue #7, while Van Sciver also provided the art for issues #7 and 8 before Çınar returned. Veteran writer/artist Dan Jurgens took over the series with issue #13 in 2012, until the series&#x27; end with issue #20 in 2013.

In 2016, Firestorm was one of the features in the &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; television series, which united Martin Stein and Jefferson Jackson as Firestorm.

Firestorm has faced off with many enemies in his publication history. Thinker and Danton Black/Multiplex was introduced in issue 1, and Killer Frost was introduced in issue 3. Introduced in &quot;Firestorm&quot; Volume 2, this included Black Bison, Plastique, 2000 Committee, Hyena, the Assassination Bureau, Enforcer, Mindboggler, Breathtaker, Pozhar, Sand Demon, Shadowstorm, Shango, Slipknot, Stalnoivolk, Tokamak, Weasel, and Zuggernaut. Other enemies introduced later in publication included Bolt (&quot;Blue Devil&quot; #6), Brimstone (&quot;Legends&quot; #1), Naiad (&quot;Firestorm, the Nuclear Man&quot; #90), and Deathstorm (&quot;Brightest Day&quot; #10).

==Aliases==
===Ronnie Raymond / Martin Stein===
The original Firestorm was distinguished by his integrated dual identity. High school student Ronnie Raymond and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Martin Stein were caught in an accident that allowed them to fuse into Firestorm. Due to Stein being unconscious during the accident, Raymond was prominently in command of the Firestorm form with Stein a voice of reason inside his mind, able to offer Raymond advice on how to use their powers without having any control. Banter between the two was a hallmark of their adventures. Stein was initially completely unaware of their dual identity, leaving him concerned about his unusual disappearances and blackouts, but Ronnie was eventually able to convince him of the truth, allowing them to bond as separate individuals rather than as parts of a whole.

===Ronnie Raymond / Martin Stein / Mikhail Arkadin===
When Conway left the series in 1986, John Ostrander (with artist Joe Brozowski) began writing the Firestorm stories. His first major story arc pitted Firestorm against the world as the hero, acting on a suggestion from a terminally ill Professor Stein, demanded that the United States and the Soviet Union destroy all of their nuclear weapons. After confrontations with the Justice League and most of his enemies, Firestorm faced the Russian nuclear superhero Pozhar in the Nevada desert, where an atomic bomb was dropped on them. A new Firestorm resulted, a fusion of the two heroes: this new Firestorm was composed of Ronnie Raymond and the Russian Mikhail Arkadin but controlled by Stein&#x27;s disembodied amnesiac mind.

===Fire Elemental===
The Firestorm with Arkadin proved to be a transitional phase, as in 1989 Ostrander fundamentally changed the character of Firestorm by revealing that Firestorm was a &quot;Fire Elemental&quot;. Firestorm now became something of an environmental crusader, formed from Ronnie Raymond, Mikhail Arkadin, and Svarozhich, a Soviet clone of the previous Firestorm, but with a new mind. Martin Stein, no longer part of the composite at all, continued to play a role, but the focus was on this radically different character. New artist Tom Mandrake would create a new look to match. During this time, Firestorm meets Sango and the Orishas, the elemental gods of Nigeria.

By the series&#x27; 100th issue, Stein learns that he was intended to be the true Fire Elemental and would have been being it not for Raymond also being there by circumstance. Raymond and Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein as Firestorm is exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth. Subsequently, he spends many years traveling through space as a wanderer, rarely returning to Earth.

After the transition to the elemental Firestorm, all of the main characters from the series vanished from the comics for some time after the cancellation of the &quot;Firestorm&quot; comic in 1990. Raymond eventually returned in the pages of &quot;Extreme Justice&quot;. Raymond, at the time undergoing treatment for leukemia, regained his original powers after a chemotherapy session. It took the combined might of the Justice League led by Captain Atom, and the returned elemental Firestorm, to restore Ronnie&#x27;s health. Firestorm began to appear regularly in a number of DC titles, though lacking the guidance and knowledge necessary to use his skills wisely. Firestorm was drafted by Batman into a &quot;replacement&quot; Justice League that was commissioned in case something befell the original team (in this case, being stranded in the distant past in &quot;The Obsidian Age&quot; storyline). After the original team returned, Firestorm stayed on as a reserve member and participated in events such as a team-up with the Justice Society of America (in &quot;JLA/JSA: Virtue and Vice&quot;) and the crossover story &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;. He was also briefly a member of the Power Company.

===Jason Rusch===

Jason Rusch is the second Firestorm, introduced following Ronnie Raymond&#x27;s death in &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;. He was created by writer Dan Jolley and artist ChrisCross.

Jason was a 17-year-old living in Detroit who wanted nothing more than to escape his home city. He lived with his father, who had turned abusive after he lost his hand in an industrial accident. His mother left the family sometime after the accident. With the loss of a job he needed for college tuition, Jason turned to a local thug for money, accepting a job as a courier. It was on that job that he encountered the Firestorm Matrix, searching for a new host after Ronnie Raymond&#x27;s death. In the aftermath, Jason struggled to cope with his new identity and powers—a struggle that led to the death of the man who had hired him.

===Jason Rusch / Martin Stein ===
In the 2006 miniseries &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, it was revealed that Martin Stein, alive in space as the &quot;Elemental Firestorm&quot;, had sensed the presence of Jason Rusch within the Firestorm Matrix, but was unaware of Ronnie Raymond&#x27;s death. When Jason, as Firestorm, was gravely wounded in the line of duty, Stein linked with him in a variation of the merge, promising Jason a new Firestorm body to let him return into battle (although Martin had been unable to save his friend Mick Wong) and asking him about Ronnie&#x27;s fate.

Accepting Martin&#x27;s proposal, Jason asked Stein to become the permanent second member of the Firestorm matrix. Sensing his &quot;errors&quot; (including Mick&#x27;s death) were the result of his youth and lack of experience, he sought the experience and maturity of Stein. Stein refused at first, but later accepted Jason&#x27;s request, thus ensuring both a new Firestorm body and the reconstruction of human bodies for both Rusch and Stein.

It was revealed in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; that Jason would have been a native of Earth-Eight in the old multiverse.

===Jason Rusch / Firehawk ===
As the storyline jumped ahead one year (and the series was re-titled as &quot;Firestorm the Nuclear Man&quot; from issue #23 on), Martin Stein has mysteriously vanished, and Jason Rusch has been merging with Firehawk to become Firestorm, allowing him to use her powers as well. The two decided to look for Stein together. Stein had been kidnapped and tortured by the Pupil (Adrian Burroughs), a former teaching assistant of Stein. Flanked by the D.O.L.L.I.s, a group of cyborg soldiers of limited cognitive ability, the Pupil questioned Stein about the secrets of the universe. Jason and Lorraine, along with the mysterious teleporter Gehenna, freed the captured Stein and restored him to full health. Jason is a college freshman at New York City&#x27;s Columbus University and seems to have ties with Dani Sharpe, a member of the senior staff at LexCorp.

The Firestorm team of Jason and Firehawk made several appearances across the DC universe before the search for Martin Stein ended. This included dealing with the latest OMAC and teaming up with Superman in the &quot;Back in Action&quot; story arc in &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Firehawk later introduced Jason to Pozhar, a Russian superhero who was once a part of the Firestorm Matrix; together, the trio takes on a newly reborn Tokamak. This series ended with &quot;Firestorm the Nuclear Man&quot; #35 (April 2007).

===Jason Rusch / Ronnie Raymond ===
In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Ronnie Raymond is resurrected as a Black Lantern dubbed Deathstorm. In &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Deathstorm becomes a separate entity. Ronnie is fully resurrected by the Life Entity and works with Jason to stop him from destroying the universe.

In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Ronnie and Jason are classmates who gain powers after obtaining Martin Stein&#x27;s &quot;God Particle&quot;. They are able to operate as separate Firestorms or merge into a creature dubbed Fury.

===&quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;===
In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Doctor Manhattan informs Ronnie that Stein deliberately transformed the two into Firestorm to study metahumans. Despite this, the two continue to work together until the Firestorm matrix is corrupted by exposure to Lazarus Pit resin and causes Stein to age rapidly.

==Powers and abilities==
Firestorm has the ability to rearrange molecular or particle structures of any substance into almost anything else, creating different atomic structures of equal mass. He can transmute the basic composition of an object (e.g., transmuting lead into gold) and can also change its shape or form at will. Much like Green Lantern&#x27;s limitations, Firestorm can only create items whose workings are understood by the &quot;driver&quot; of the Firestorm Matrix, through he can make more complex sentient constructs out of the Matrix&#x27;s energies. Unlike Green Lantern&#x27;s creations, Firestorm&#x27;s alterations are permanent unless he reverses them.

Initially, he could not affect organic matter without painful, even lethal, feedback (i.e., fatal biophysical disruption or even localized particle motion phenomena like extreme changes in the weather). It was later revealed that Firestorm could always change organic matter, but opted not to. As Jason Rusch became Firestorm, however, this weakness appeared to have dissipated. With old and new variations, the organic limitation does not extend to his own person, as its users can molecularly change their driver self at will, allowing them to regenerate lost or damaged bodily tissue, boost immune systems, shape-shift, increase physical capabilities and survive indefinitely without food, sleep, water or air. Capacities as such produce superhuman levels of strength, durability, stamina and resistance to injury great enough to challenge the New Gods or surviving the rigors of outer space and sitting near the inner corona above the Sun&#x27;s photosphere without discomfort. Stein has stated Firestorm&#x27;s power to be theoretically infinite, harnessing the spark of creation, the Big Bang itself. However, infinite power runs the risk of burning out its host.

While the Firestorm Matrix can be utilized by a single host, it is not recommended. The Matrix functions best with two people, a primary and secondary pilot, to comprehend and master it. Martin instructed Jason on how to study current and potential powers available to them within the Matrix and to manually adjust them on the fly at a later date. Its main source of energy stemmed from the ambient stellar energies of native stars and suns but could also use its co-pilot as a power source, though they will burn out over time and genetically disintegrate if not properly adjusted to its power.

The merging aspect of the Matrix can enable outside fusions which assimilate any inherent abilities these others might possess. However, this can diminish its effectiveness and stability. Rusch has shown he can spontaneously warp himself and others he had previously merged with to his specific location, triggering the neural pathway connection and allowing the gestalt to access each other&#x27;s knowledge and memories to better utilize Firestorm&#x27;s capabilities. Users of the Firestorm Matrix can access a type of ancestral memory from the continuum of past Matrix users, allowing them to access the latest knowledge of the atoms comprising it. This also translates into a form of time-space sight in which the Matrix user can glimpse the past, present, future, and alternate lives of every other Firestorm throughout reality using a collective of subatomic wormholes which exist as a part of the Matrix. This power is too complex to properly control; thus, it has been highly unreliable as an ability.

The driver can fly at supersonic speeds in an atmosphere and reach escape velocities. The driver can also adjust the driver&#x27;s body&#x27;s size or pull and enlarge others from the subatomic universe at will, Rusch having once dragged Ray Palmer from his microscopic size to the natural world while on Apokolips. Manipulation of the self at the subatomic level allows the driver to become intangible and pass through solid objects. This allowed Rusch to communicate with John Stewart and sift through his mind telepathically after he had been taken over by the void beast. Firestorm is also adept at absorbing and redistributing radiation or energy both harmlessly and productively (such as in &quot;Green Lantern: Circle of Fire&quot; #7, having both absorbed Zeta Radiation from Adam Strange&#x27;s body and repurposed it to turn a universe-destroying quasar back onto itself and absorb the fallout from a massive nuclear detonation).) He can generate destructive or concussive blasts of nuclear energy, through which he can also channel his transmogrification powers.

While the Matrix grants the fusers unique powers, it can also accidentally bestow them on individuals caught in the Matrix by mistake. One example is Nanette Phaedon, wife of the late Allen Phaedon, who gained the ability to change her quantum state for size-shifting and flight by her own will. Following Raymond&#x27;s resurrection during &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Firestorm gained the ability to switch &quot;drivers&quot; between Ronnie and Jason at will; before that, only the active driver was in control, with the dormant consciousness only able to advise the other on what action to take. One of the faults of a Firestorm fusion is that the stronger psyche will have dominance of the Matrix&#x27;s power, such as when Jason fused with Luis Salvador who overpowered him from the passenger seat of the Matrix.

During &quot;The New 52&quot;, the Firestorm Matrix could be shared through multiple users at a time. Users could fuse and become stronger, but more unstable. The entity formed between Ronnie and Jason when using the Matrix in tandem created a nuclear being called &quot;the Fury&quot;. It was also shown that The Matrix shares a kinship to the Quantum Field in some way, enabling Firestorm users to derive its power for subatomic transmutation and manipulation. Some believe it is key to the fabled God particle theory. Its merging properties can place a large burden on the user; Firestorm runs the risk of reaching critical mass and detonating. At worst, the fusion of too many users in the Matrix could trigger a second Big Bang.

==Other versions==
Firestorm has appeared in various alternate realities within the DC Multiverse: a gender-reversed version appears in &quot;Countdown: The Search for Ray Palmer&quot; as an inhabitant of Earth-11; a version of Ronnie Raymond appeared in &quot;&quot;, as a captive of Cadmus Labs; a Firestork of the Just&#x27;a Lotta Animals; and a merger of Ronnie Raymond and Nathaniel Adam of Earth-37 called Quantum-Storm who was summoned by Monarch in the miniseries &quot;&quot;.

===Deathstorm===
An evil version of Firestorm called Deathstorm was created by Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi during the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; event. He was originally Ronnie Raymond&#x27;s corpse reanimated as a Black Lantern. He attacks Jason Rusch and kills Gehenna before eventually being destroyed and Raymond fully restored to life. 

Later, Black Lantern energy combines with the Firestorm Matrix to create a new version separate from Raymond. He attempts to manipulate Raymond and Rusch into fighting, which would destabilize the Firestorm Matrix and destroy the universe, before being killed by the Life Entity.

Earth-Three&#x27;s equivalent of Deathstorm is Martin Stein, who transformed after experimenting on himself. In &quot;Trinity War&quot;, Deathstorm appears as a member of the Crime Syndicate before being killed by Mazahs.

===We-Are-Firestorm===
A version of Firestorm crafted by Anansi in Volume Two of &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, he appears to be a form of sentient red energy and is a member of that reality&#x27;s Justice League.

<text>No Sweat is a broad-based not-for-profit organisation with HQ in London&#x27;s Kings Cross, England, which fights for the well-being and protection of sweatshop labourers, not only in developing countries but also in Britain.

== History ==
Working with the GMB Union in London&#x27;s East End, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 2005, the organisation infiltrated and exposed sweatshops operating for Topshop and reported those involved to the authorities. No Sweat encourages consumers to choose ethically sourced clothing, whilst firmly rejecting boycotts which only lead to factories being moved further from the limelight, further increasing the dangers to those trapped in the cycle of wage slavery.

== Partners ==
The organisation works variously with parts of the TUC and other trade union organisations, the National Garment Workers Federation and closely cooperates with the Ethical Threads clothing company in Britain. It is also aligned with other campaign groups like Labour Behind the Label, and with &quot;No Sweat Apparel&quot; in the United States. Independent of political influence, the group seeks to reach out to all parts of the global community to help stamp out sweatshop labour fullstop - often dealing directly with groups of workers that would normally have no voice and no support outside their immediate community - for example Batay Ouvriye in Haiti and individuals like jailed union official Ali Nejati in Iran.

== Events ==
They hold numerous events in London, Sheffield, Glasgow, Brighton and elsewhere around the United Kingdom, and have a presence at many events such as Glastonbury Festival&#x27;s Leftfield and many smaller counter-culture festivals and gigs.

Recently the organisation has been running a successful comedy night on the 2nd Thursday of each month in London&#x27;s Cross Kings basement rooms, guest acts have included Mark Thomas, Josie Long, Rob Newman, Robin Ince and Simon Munnery as well as live podcasts from established acts such as Richard Herring and Andrew Collins and legendary punk filmmaker Don Letts.

These events all aim to publicise the plight of sweatshop workers (children and adults) around the world as well as giving a platform to other, less prominent groups where appropriate and have developed a reputation as the last bastion of genuine counter culture in the now hyper-developed Kings Cross area.

=== Fashion parade ===
In April 2009 the BBC news and Times newspapers covered a No Sweat fashion parade outside Primark&#x27;s flagship Oxford St store - an event organised in response to recent outcry over the company&#x27;s atrocious labour policies and relationships with subsidiary contractors who make regular use of child labour, as highlighted by the BBC&#x27;s in 2006.

== Goals ==
The group&#x27;s activities are primarily two-fold, firstly to organise direct action campaigns to pressure the big brand companies that exploit people through sweatshop labour, secondly to work with independent organisations around the globe to support vulnerable people and help them to unite together and stand up to their employers, demanding safe working conditions, decent hours and a living wage as well as independent trade union rights to protect them from malicious attacks and extreme exploitation.

They are volunteer-run, and anyone can get involved.

<doc id="640713" wikidata="Q5634699" url="?curid=640713" title="HMS Trump (P333)">
<text>HMS &quot;Trump&quot; (pennant number P333) was a British submarine of the third group of the T class. She was built by Vickers-Armstrongs, Barrow, and launched on 25 March 1944. So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy (RN) to bear the name &quot;Trump&quot;. She spent the majority of her life attached to the 4th Submarine Squadron based in Australia. She was kept in service following the war and was refitted for greater underwater performance, and was the final RN submarine to be posted in Australia, departing in January 1969. She was sold off and broken up for scrap in August 1971.

==Design and description==
HMS &quot;Trump&quot; was one of the group three of T-class submarines. She was part of the second batch of the third group to be ordered, in 1941. She was one of a number of boats which had an all-welded hull which increased diving depth to , an increase of . The torpedo armament was the same as the earlier group two, although by the time group three was coming into service it was realised that external torpedo tubes had major problems and affected the streamlining of the boats; the external tubes were abandoned in the following . Due to expected use in tropical climates, boats of group three were equipped with freon blowers in order to deal with the increased temperatures.

==Service==

===World War II===
&quot;Trump&quot; was commissioned in July 1944. After trials and a work-up in the North Sea in mid-October she was sent to Perth in Western Australia. On arrival, she joined the 4th Submarine Squadron, supported by the depot ship . From Perth, &quot;Trump&quot; carried out four patrols before the end of the war.

During her Far East service, &quot;Trump&quot; sank the Japanese guard boat &quot;No. 15 Shosei Maru&quot; on 13 May; a Japanese sailing vessel on 24 May; and two coasters, one on 29 May and the other on 1 June. She sank a tanker on 5 June and together with her sister boat , she sank a Japanese cargo vessel on 9 August.

Also with &quot;Tiptoe&quot;, &quot;Trump&quot; carried out an attack on a convoy on 3 August. Although it was escorted by a Japanese patrol boat, they successfully sank &quot;Tencho Maru&quot;, an army cargo ship, with the sinking credited to &quot;Tiptoe&quot;.

===Post war===
&quot;Trump&quot; survived the war and continued in service with the Royal Navy. &quot;Trump&quot; was one of several all-welded T-class submarines rebuilt for greater underwater performance. This &quot;Slippery T&quot; or &quot;Super T&quot; conversion involved the removal of the deck gun and the replacement of the conning tower with a streamlined &quot;fin&quot;. Extra batteries were installed below the control room and additional electric motors were accommodated by cutting through the pressure hull and adding in a new hull section inserted aft of the control room. The diesel engines were modified and supercharged with output increased by . The gun armaments and external torpedo tubes were removed, and the bow reshaped. &quot;Trump&quot; was one of two submarines, the other being , which had the bridge incorporated into the added fin section; and was the last to undergo this conversion.

In 1960, &quot;Trump&quot;, along with and &quot;Tabard&quot;, rejoined the 4th Submarine Flotilla at Sydney, Australia. There, they operated with units of the Far East Fleet, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy. In June 1964, she participated in the &quot;NEWS EX&quot; anti-submarine exercise in the Hauraki Gulf off the coast of New Zealand.

&quot;Trump&quot; underwent refits at Cockatoo Dockyard, between January 1962 and April 1963, and again between August 1965 and October 1966. She was the final Royal Navy submarine to be on station in Australia, departing on 10 January 1969 when the 1st Australian Submarine squadron was formed from the RN 4th Submarine Squadron. She was temporarily assigned to the Royal Australian Navy while boats of the were under construction, but remained a Royal Navy submarine. &quot;Trump&quot; was scrapped at Newport from 1 August 1971.

<text>In mathematics, the Hales–Jewett theorem is a fundamental combinatorial result of Ramsey theory named after Alfred W. Hales and Robert I. Jewett, concerning the degree to which high-dimensional objects must necessarily exhibit some combinatorial structure.

An informal geometric statement of the theorem is that for any positive integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;c&quot; there is a number &quot;H&quot; such that if the cells of a &quot;H&quot;-dimensional &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot;×...×&quot;n&quot; cube are colored with &quot;c&quot; colors, there must be one row, column, or certain diagonal (more details below) of length &quot;n&quot; all of whose cells are the same color. In other words, assuming &quot;n&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are fixed, the higher-dimensional, multi-player, &quot;n&quot;-in-a-row generalization of a game of tic-tac-toe with &quot;c&quot; players cannot end in a draw, no matter how large &quot;n&quot; is, no matter how many people &quot;c&quot; are playing, and no matter which player plays each turn, provided only that it is played on a board of sufficiently high dimension &quot;H&quot;. By a standard strategy-stealing argument, one can thus conclude that if two players alternate, then the first player has a winning strategy when &quot;H&quot; is sufficiently large, though no practical algorithm for obtaining this strategy is known.

==Formal statement==

Let &quot;W&quot; be the set of words of length &quot;H&quot; over an alphabet with &quot;n&quot; letters; that is, the set of sequences of {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} of length &quot;H&quot;. This set forms the hypercube that is the subject of the theorem. 
A &quot;variable word&quot; &quot;w&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) over &quot;W&quot; still has length &quot;H&quot; but includes the special element &quot;x&quot; in place of at least one of the letters. The words &quot;w&quot;(1), &quot;w&quot;(2), ..., &quot;w&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) obtained by replacing all instances of the special element &quot;x&quot; with 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;, form a combinatorial line in the space &quot;W&quot;; combinatorial lines correspond to rows, columns, and (some of the) diagonals of the hypercube. The Hales–Jewett theorem then states that for given positive integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, there exists a positive integer &quot;H&quot;, depending on &quot;n&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, such that for any partition of &quot;W&quot; into &quot;c&quot; parts, there is at least one part that contains an entire combinatorial line.

For example, take &quot;n&quot; = 3, &quot;H&quot; = 2, and &quot;c&quot; = 2. The hypercube &quot;W&quot; in this case
is just the standard tic-tac-toe board, with nine positions:

A typical combinatorial
line would be the word 2x, which corresponds to the line 21, 22, 23; another combinatorial line is xx, which is the line
11, 22, 33. (Note that the line 13, 22, 31, while a valid line for the game tic-tac-toe, is not considered a combinatorial line.) In this particular case, the Hales–Jewett theorem does not apply; it is possible to divide
the tic-tac-toe board into two sets, e.g. {11, 22, 23, 31} and {12, 13, 21, 32, 33}, neither of which contain
a combinatorial line (and would correspond to a draw in the game of tic-tac-toe). On the other hand, if we increase
&quot;H&quot; to, say, 8 (so that the board is now eight-dimensional, with 38 = 6561 positions), and partition this board
into two sets (the &quot;noughts&quot; and &quot;crosses&quot;), then one of the two sets must contain a combinatorial line (i.e. no draw is possible in this variant of tic-tac-toe). For a proof, see below.

==Proof of Hales–Jewett theorem (in a special case)==

We now prove the Hales–Jewett theorem in the special case &quot;n&quot; = 3, &quot;c&quot; = 2, &quot;H&quot; = 8 discussed above. The idea is to
reduce this task to that of proving simpler versions of the Hales–Jewett theorem (in this particular case, to the cases &quot;n&quot; = 2, &quot;c&quot; = 2, &quot;H&quot; = 2 and &quot;n&quot; = 2, &quot;c&quot; = 6, &quot;H&quot; = 6). One can prove the general case of the Hales–Jewett theorem by similar methods, using mathematical induction.

Each element of the hypercube &quot;W&quot; is a string of eight numbers from 1 to 3, e.g. 13211321 is an element of the hypercube. We are assuming that this hypercube is completely filled with &quot;noughts&quot; and &quot;crosses&quot;. We shall use a proof by contradiction and assume that neither the set of noughts nor the set of crosses contains a combinatorial line. If we fix the first six elements of such a string and let the last two vary, we obtain an ordinary tic-tac-toe board, for instance &quot;132113??&quot; gives such a board. For each such board &quot;abcdef??&quot;, we consider the positions
&quot;abcdef11&quot;, &quot;abcdef12&quot;, &quot;abcdef22&quot;. Each of these must be filled with either a nought or a cross, so by the pigeonhole principle two of them must be filled with the same symbol. Since any two of these positions are part of
a combinatorial line, the third element of that line must be occupied by the opposite symbol (since we are assuming that no combinatorial line has all three elements filled with the same symbol). In other words, for each choice of &quot;abcdef&quot; (which can be thought of as an element of the six-dimensional hypercube &quot;W&quot;), there are six (overlapping) possibilities:

# abcdef11 and abcdef12 are noughts; abcdef13 is a cross.
# abcdef11 and abcdef22 are noughts; abcdef33 is a cross.
# abcdef12 and abcdef22 are noughts; abcdef32 is a cross.
# abcdef11 and abcdef12 are crosses; abcdef13 is a nought.
# abcdef11 and abcdef22 are crosses; abcdef33 is a nought.
# abcdef12 and abcdef22 are crosses; abcdef32 is a nought.

Thus we can partition the six-dimensional hypercube &quot;W&quot; into six classes, corresponding to each of the above six possibilities. (If an element abcdef obeys multiple possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily, e.g. by choosing the highest one on the above list).

Now consider the seven elements 111111, 111112, 111122, 111222, 112222, 122222, 222222 in &quot;W&quot;. By the pigeonhole principle, two of these elements must fall into the same class. Suppose for instance
111112 and 112222 fall into class (5), thus 11111211, 11111222, 11222211, 11222222 are crosses and 11111233, 11222233 are noughts. But now consider the position 11333233, which must be filled with either a cross or a nought. If it is filled with a cross, then the combinatorial line 11xxx2xx is filled entirely with crosses, contradicting our hypothesis. If instead it is filled with a nought, then the combinatorial line 11xxx233 is filled entirely with noughts, again contradicting our hypothesis. Similarly if any other two of the above seven elements of &quot;W&quot; fall into the same class. Since we have a contradiction in all cases, the original hypothesis must be false; thus there must exist at least one combinatorial line consisting entirely of noughts or entirely of crosses.

The above argument was somewhat wasteful; in fact the same theorem holds for &quot;H&quot; = 4.
If one extends the above argument to general values of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, then &quot;H&quot; will grow very fast; even when &quot;c&quot; = 2 (which corresponds to two-player tic-tac-toe) the &quot;H&quot; given by the above argument grows as fast as the Ackermann function. The first primitive recursive bound is due to Saharon Shelah, and is still the best known bound in general for the &quot;Hales–Jewett number&quot; &quot;H&quot; = &quot;H&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;c&quot;).

==Connections with other theorems==
Observe that the above argument also gives the following corollary: if we let &quot;A&quot; be the set of all
eight-digit numbers whose digits are all either 1, 2, 3 (thus &quot;A&quot; contains numbers such as 11333233),
and we color &quot;A&quot; with two colors, then &quot;A&quot; contains at least one arithmetic progression of length three, all of whose elements are the same color. This is simply because all of the combinatorial lines appearing in the above proof of the Hales–Jewett theorem, also form arithmetic progressions in decimal notation. A more general formulation of this argument can be used to show that the Hales–Jewett theorem generalizes van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem. Indeed the Hales–Jewett theorem is substantially a stronger theorem.

Just as van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem has a stronger &quot;density version&quot; in Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem, the Hales–Jewett theorem also has a density version. In this strengthened version of the Hales–Jewett theorem, instead of coloring the entire hypercube &quot;W&quot; into &quot;c&quot; colors, one is given an arbitrary subset &quot;A&quot; of the hypercube &quot;W&quot; with some given density 0 &lt; δ &lt; 1. The theorem states that if &quot;H&quot; is sufficiently large depending on &quot;n&quot; and δ, then the set &quot;A&quot; must necessarily contain an entire combinatorial line.

The density Hales–Jewett theorem was originally proved by Furstenberg and Katznelson using ergodic theory. In 2009, the Polymath Project developed a new proof of the density Hales–Jewett theorem based on ideas from the proof of the corners theorem. Dodos, Kanellopoulos, and Tyros gave a simplified version of the Polymath proof.

The Hales–Jewett is generalized by the Graham–Rothschild theorem, on higher-dimensional combinatorial cubes.

<text>Alexandre Joseph &quot;Lex&quot; Goudsmit (; 15 March 1913 – 10 December 1999) was a Dutch-Belgian actor.

Goudsmit&#x27;s father, a diamond worker, was Jewish and his mother Roman Catholic. He became famous in 1966 for playing Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, which role he performed some 1100 times in the Netherlands and in London. He played many characters on Dutch television, among others in the popular youth series &quot;Q en Q&quot; (1974) and &quot;Thomas en Senior&quot; (1985–88). From 1984 to 1999 he played Grandpa Lex on &quot;Sesamstraat&quot;, the Dutch version of Sesame Street. Goudsmit was one of the artists who recorded the song &quot;Shalom from Holland&quot; (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991.

When Goudsmit died as the consequences of a stroke, instead of doing an episode dealing with his death, along the lines of Mr. Hooper&#x27;s death, the producers addressed the issue on the program following &quot;Sesamstraat&quot;, called &quot;Jeugdjournaal&quot; (Youth News). The program aired a compilation of his best appearances on the show and commented on his death. Goudsmit had told producers that he wanted to stay on &quot;Sesamstraat&quot; even after his death, so the latest scenes he taped were still used on the next season. During this season, he was slowly phased out of the show and Aart Staartjes, who played the grumpy neighbor &quot;Meneer Aart&quot;, became the grandfather figure.

<text>Richard Preston (born August 5, 1954) is a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and bestselling author who has written books about infectious disease, bioterrorism, redwoods and other subjects, as well as fiction.

==Biography==
Preston was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He graduated Wellesley High School in Massachusetts in 1972 and attended Pomona College in Claremont, California. He earned a Ph.D. in English from Princeton University in 1983.

His 1992 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article &quot;Crisis in the Hot Zone&quot; was expanded into his breakout book, &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; (1994). It is classified as a &quot;non-fiction thriller&quot; about ebolaviruses. He learned of Ebola through such contacts as U.S. Army researchers Drs. C.J. Peters and Nancy Jaax. His fascination began during a visit to Africa where he was an eyewitness to epidemics. The book served as the (very loose) basis of the Hollywood movie &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995) about military machinations surrounding a fictional &quot;Motaba virus&quot;.

Preston&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cobra Event&quot; (1998), about a terrorism release of a fictional virus combining various qualities of different diseases upon New York City, alarmed even then-President Bill Clinton who, shortly after reading it, instigated a review of bio-terror threats to the U.S. The book strove to tell a fast-paced thriller narrative within the bounds of well-researched bio-terrorism possibility, and was reportedly pressed upon Clinton by a molecular biologist when he was attending a Renaissance Weekend event.

&quot;The Demon in the Freezer&quot; (2002) covers the story of the eradication of smallpox, perhaps the most destructive virus to have plagued mankind. It details the survival of the virus in research labs and bio-weapon programs of Russia and other nations, despite its eradication in the human population. The narrative continues with anthrax, a bacterial disease of cattle and humans, used in the 2001 anthrax attacks.

&quot;First Light&quot; and &quot;American Steel&quot; are non-fiction books addressing astrophysics and the steel industry. First Light centers around the history of the Hale Telescope on Palomar Mountain, and the astronomers who work there. American Steel chronicles the history of the Nucor steel company, and focuses on its newest steel plant in Indiana, whose success depends on a new steel-sheet making machine engineered in West Germany.

Preston&#x27;s personal hobby of recreational tree climbing is introduced in &quot;The Wild Trees&quot; (2007). His climbing experience likely led him to write about the largest known redwoods like Lost Monarch in the Grove of Titans, or Iluvatar, described in that book along with delicate forest canopy ecosystems.

Preston&#x27;s &quot;Panic in Level 4: Cannibals, Killer Viruses, and Other Journeys to the Edge of Science&quot; is a collection of essays related to his experiences researching his previous books.

In November 2009, Preston was selected by Harper-Collins and the Michael Crichton estate to complete his unfinished novel &quot;Micro&quot; after Crichton&#x27;s death in November 2008. The book was released on November 22, 2011. Approximately a third of Micro was completed by Crichton. Preston completed the book according to the author&#x27;s remaining outline, notes, and research.

In 2016, Preston served as the Bedell Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Iowa&#x27;s Nonfiction Writing Program where he judged the prestigious Iowa Prize in Literary Nonfiction.

Preston resides in Hopewell, New Jersey with his wife, Michelle, and their two daughters and one son. He is also the brother of best-selling author Douglas Preston.

Minor planet 3792 Preston is named in his honor.

<text>Arturo Labriola (; 21 January 1873 – 23 June 1959) was an Italian revolutionary syndicalist and socialist politician and journalist.

==Life==

===Early political activity (until 1897)===
Labriola was born in Naples on 21 January 1873 to Luigi Labriola, an artisan. While studying jurisprudence in University of Naples, Arturo Labriola started his political activity. In 1891 he joined the Republican-Socialist University Circle. Between 1892 and 1895, he collaborated on various periodicals: &quot;Socialismo Popolare&quot;, edited by Carlo Monicelli, &quot;Rivista Popolare di Politica, Litteratura e Scienze Sociali&quot;, edited by Napoleone Colajanni and &quot;Critica Sociale&quot;, edited by Filippo Turati. In 1894–1895, Labriola was involved with the &quot;Fasci Siciliani&quot; and therefore was suspended for one year from university studies. In 1897, Labriola joined Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and fought in the Greco-Turkish War in Crete.

===Life in exile (1898–1900)===
In May 1898, workers in Milan organized strikes and protests to demonstrate against the government. The riots were brutally repressed: troops fired on demonstrators, and Filippo Turati was arrested, and accused of inspiring the riots. Labriola fled to Geneva in order to elude arrest. There, he taught at University of Geneva and worked with Vilfredo Pareto. Labriola was expelled from Switzerland in the same year and moved to Paris. In Paris he met the socialists Georges Sorel, Hubert Lagardelle and Paul Lafargue.

===Revolutionary syndicalist period===
He returned to Italy in 1900, and in 1902 published a weekly called &quot;Avanguardia Socialista&quot; which became the centre of activity for Italian revolutionary syndicalism. From 1910 to 1911 he was one of the leading contributors of &quot;La Lupa&quot;, a weekly magazine supporting the revolution. He later withdrew his support for revolution, and adopted Marxist Reformism, becoming a member of the Italian Parliament as an independent. Favourable to Italy&#x27;s participation in World War I, Labriola also served as Minister of Labor in the last of Giovanni Giolitti&#x27;s cabinets (1920).

An opponent of Fascism, he had to take exile in France after Benito Mussolini came to power, but returned in 1935. In 1946 he was elected member of the Constituent Assembly of Italy as a National Democratic Union candidate. In 1948 he became a senator of the new Republic.

As it was confirmed by the former President of the Grand Orient of Italy, he was one of the eight father constituents belonging to the main Italian Masonic organization.

<text>ABC Records was an American record label founded in New York City in 1955. It originated as the main popular music label operated by the Am-Par Record Corporation. Am-Par also created the Impulse! jazz label in 1960. It acquired many labels before ABC was sold to MCA Records in 1979. ABC produced music in a variety of genres: pop, rock, jazz, country, rhythm and blues, soundtrack, gospel, and polka. In addition to producing records, ABC licensed masters from independent record producers, and purchased regionally released records for national distribution.

The label was initially called Am-Par Records (1955), but quickly changed to ABC-Paramount Records (1955–1966), and then renamed ABC Records in 1966.

==History==
===Background===
In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Federal Communications Commission took action against the Anti-competitive practices of movie studios and broadcasting companies, forcing the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) to sell the Blue Network, the sister network of NBC Red Network, in 1943. The Blue Network was purchased by Edward J. Noble, who changed the company&#x27;s name to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1946. In 1953, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, the divested former exhibition/cinema division of Paramount Pictures, with the newly-merged corporation, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (AB-PT) chaired by former Paramount Theaters executive Leonard Goldenson and headquartered at 1501 Broadway in New York City, above the Paramount Theater in Times Square.

===ABC-Paramount Records===

American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres formed a records division, incorporating the Am-Par Record Corporation on with Samuel H. Clark as its first president. By August 1955, the unit was organized with AMPCO (ASCAP) and PAMCO (BMI) as subsidiary publishing units. Though the record label was established as Am-Par, no records were released until after the division&#x27;s name was changed to ABC-Paramount in September 1955.

Eydie Gorme was the company&#x27;s first signed artist. The company recorded its first single record, &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot; and &quot;Come Home&quot;, both by Gorme. Alec Templeton&#x27;s &quot;Smart Alec&quot; was the company&#x27;s first LP recorded, also in September 1955.

One of Gorme&#x27;s singles was its first release in January 1956. &quot;Chain Gang&quot; by Bobby Scott in February 1956 was the company&#x27;s first national hit. George Hamilton IV&#x27;s &quot;A Rose and a Baby Ruth&quot; single was Am-Paramount&#x27;s first million-selling single in October 1956.

In 1957, the company had two million-selling singles: in June with &quot;Diana&quot; by Paul Anka and in October with &quot;At the Hop&quot; by 
Danny &amp; the Juniors. Am-Paramount Records in May 1958 debuted the Apt subsidiary label with its first million-selling single, &quot;Little Star&quot; by the Elegants, released the same month.

Chancellor Records had Am-Par Record Corporation handle its distribution starting in 1957 and started a trend. Chancellor had its first million-selling single in October 1958 with Lloyd Price&#x27;s &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;.

Am-Par purchased Grand Award Records including the newly formed Command Records label, in 1959. The company started a second label for jazz, Impulse! Records, in November 1960. Impulse released its first four records in January 1961.

The company had artists that earned three Grammy Awards in 1960. While in January 1961, the company purchased Westminster Records, a classical label. Thus Am-Par Record had a label for each music genre.

Am-Par Record Corporation was renamed to ABC-Paramount Records, Inc. on December 7, 1961. The company opened a Los Angeles office in January 1962. Ray Charles formed Tangerine Records in March 1962 and arranged for ABC-Paramount to distribute Tangerine&#x27;s records. The company formed Jet Record Distributors based in Long Island City, N.Y. as its local distributor. Also in 1962, the company had acquired Music Guild label and library for Westminster Records.

In 1965, Clark was promoted to vice-president in charge of AB-PT&#x27;s non-broadcast operations. National sales manager Larry Newton was named ABC-Paramount president. On January 4, 1965, vice-president in charge of sales Larry Newton was promoted to president of ABC-Paramount Records. The previous president, Sam Clark was promoted to director of theater operations for American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres. Newton&#x27;s first action as president was to restart Apt Records as a teen-oriented West Coast base label under Irwin Garr.

===ABC Records===
In June 1966, the label was renamed ABC Records, and the company acquired New Deal Record Service Corp., a rack-jobbing and record distribution company, along with its affiliates.

In 1967, Dunhill Records was purchased from Lou Adler. In 1970, ABC and Dunhill moved its headquarters to Los Angeles. Newton was promoted to vice-president in charge of ABC Pictures. Dunhill co-owner Jay Lasker was named president and referred to the combined operations as ABC/Dunhill. At that time ABC had another five labels: Westminster, Command, Probe, Impulse!, and Bluesway.

At the August 29, 1970 Directors Guild meeting, ABC/Dunhill launched a number of marketing initiatives. The company planned to have writers create a broader music for the catalog market. Imprints Probe and Apt were relaunched, Probe as a label which held the international rights to ABC&#x27;s albums and Apt as a label which released budget cassettes and 8-track tapes. Jazz dropped from Impulse!&#x27;s cover for a new slogan: &quot;University Series of Fine Recordings&quot; and two new series were launched: Audio Treasury and Westminster Gold for classic and youth fare, respectively.

By May 1972, ABC formed the ABC Leisure Group, which included ABC Records, Anchor Records, and ABC Records and Tape Sales, plus a new retail record-store division. Lasker left ABC to join Ariola America Records in 1975. He was succeeded by Jerry Rubinstein, who served as company head until 1977. In November 1972, ABC bought country music company Cartwheel Records.

In 1974, ABC switched British distribution from EMI to the EMI-distributed Anchor Records, allowing ABC recordings to be issued on the ABC label in the UK, and Anchor records to be distributed by ABC on the Anchor label in the US. Also in 1974, ABC acquired Famous Music Records Group including Nashville based Dot Records then began releasing ABC country music under the ABC/Dot label until January 1979.

As a cost-cutting measure, ABC Records discarded many master tapes in the 1970s to save storage space. When these recordings were reissued on compact disc in the 1980s, CD versions were often taken from master copies which had less than optimal sound quality. The company&#x27;s last president, Steve Diener, was named to that job in 1977 after serving as head of ABC Records&#x27; international division. Because of financial problems except for its Nashville office, ABC Records was sold on January 31, 1979 to MCA Records with ABC Records being its third label likely under a different name. Instead, MCA discontinued ABC Records on March 5, 1979 and albums in the ABC catalog still selling well were reissued on MCA.

Diener died in April 2019, aged 80.

==Acquisitions==
ABC Records sub-labeled Apt to release singles. In the early 1960s, it bought Westminster, a classical music label. For jazz it created Impulse!. Led by Creed Taylor and Bob Thiele, Impulse! developed a reputation for innovative releases, including albums by John Coltrane from 1961 until his death in 1967. ABC created Bluesway for blues music. Tangerine was formed by Ray Charles to produce his albums and those he produced.

ABC Records bought Dunhill in the summer of 1967, forming ABC Dunhill Records. It also bought Don Robey&#x27;s record labels, including Duke, Peacock, Back Beat, and Song Bird on May 23, 1973.

In 1974 ABC bought the Famous Music record labels from Gulf and Western, the parent company of Paramount. This acquisition gave ABC Dot, Blue Thumb, and a distribution deal with Sire, which released the first album from the Ramones.

ABC purchased all labels from Enoch Light in October 1959. It acquired Audition, Command, Colortone, and Waldorf Music Hall.

In 1979, ABC was acquired by MCA for $30 million. It operated briefly as a separate division. MCA was absorbed by the Universal Music Group, which currently distributes recordings for ABC&#x27;s current sister company, Disney Music Group, worldwide except for Russia.

This is not the same ABC Records that operates in Australia, which is run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, although the Ampar label was distributed in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s, first by W&amp;G Records (1955–60) and then by Festival. Nor is it the sub-label of Voiceprint.

==ABC-Paramount/ABC Records label variations==
* 1955–1961: Black label, &quot;ABC-PARAMOUNT&quot; around top perimeter of label in yellow, red, and blue (repeating in that sequence) Venus medium font, with silver print for singles and the company&#x27;s name in all white letters in Venus medium and silver print for albums and logo consisting of color spectrum Möbius strip and white jagged line (representing a sound wave). Bottom perimeter of label reads: &quot;A PRODUCT OF AM-PAR RECORD CORP.&quot;
* 1961–1966: Same label as above, but disclaimer at bottom of label now reads: &quot;A PRODUCT OF ABC-PARAMOUNT RECORDS, INC.&quot;
* 1966–1967: Label name now shortened to ABC Records. Black label with large white circle at top with &quot;abc&quot; in black letters and the &quot;Möbius strip and sound wave&quot; logo under the letters. This variant was used only for singles.
* 1967–1974: Black label with small white &quot;abc&quot; circle logo in color spectrum box at top (In conjunction with this label, a brief interim label was used from 1973 to 1974 consisting of three children&#x27;s blocks spelling out ABC and one block with the &quot;abc&quot; logo in a white triangle at the top).
* 1974–1978: Yellow, orange, red and purple &quot;sunburst&quot; label with &quot;abc Records&quot; (black &quot;abc&quot; circle logo) between two black lines at top. (Note: The other ABC labels would also adopt this label, such as Dunhill, Dot, Blue Thumb with its logo next to the &quot;abc&quot; logo, and Backbeat and Impulse! with a green background rather than a yellow background, but the circles were the same.)
* 1978–1979: Same multi-colored label as above, but with 1/8 note featuring &quot;abc&quot; inside the bottom of the note. Late pressings show &quot;Mfg. &amp; Dist. by MCA Distributing Corp...&quot; at the bottom perimeter, just before the ABC label was discontinued and its artists transferred to MCA.

==Management of ABC Records catalog today==
The catalogs of ABC Records and its sub-labels are now controlled by Universal Music Group. UMG also distributes Disney Music Group, which is owned by ABC&#x27;s current parent, The Walt Disney Company, with the following exceptions:
* The Paul Anka ABC-Paramount catalog is controlled by Anka himself. Distribution is done by Universal Music Enterprises and its Canadian counterpart UMusic.
* The Jim Croce catalog is controlled by the Croce estate and R2M Music, and is distributed by BMG Rights Management.
* The Ray Charles catalog is controlled by the Charles estate and is currently licensed to Concord Records. Concord&#x27;s recordings are distributed by UMG.
* The Amazing Rhythm Aces catalog and the recordings that former 5th Dimension members Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. made for ABC are controlled by Sony Music.
* Lawrence Welk acquired his Dot recordings (prior to ABC acquiring the label) which were reissued on his Ranwood Records label. Like Concord, Ranwood is also distributed by UMG.

The following labels manage different genres:
* Pop, rock, R&amp;B: Geffen
* Jazz: Impulse!, Impulse!/Verve

<text>Dionisio Jesús Valdés Rodríguez, better known as Chucho (born October 9, 1941), is a Cuban pianist, bandleader, composer and arranger whose career spans over 50 years. An original member of the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna, in 1973 he founded the group Irakere, one of Cuba&#x27;s best-known Latin jazz bands. 

Both his father, Bebo Valdés, and his son, Chuchito, are pianists as well. As a solo artist, he has won seven Grammy Awards and four Latin Grammy Awards.

== Career ==
Chucho Valdés&#x27;s first recorded sessions as a leader took place in late January 1964 in the Areíto Studios of Havana (former Panart studios) owned by the newly formed EGREM. These early sessions included Paquito D&#x27;Rivera on alto saxophone and clarinet, Alberto Giral on trombone, Julio Vento on flute, Carlos Emilio Morales on guitar, Kike Hernández on double bass, Emilio del Monte on drums and Óscar Valdés Jr. on congas. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, these would be the members of his jazz combo, whose lineup would often change, sometimes including bassists Cachaíto and later Carlos del Puerto, and drummers Guillermo Barreto and later Enrique Plá.

In 1967, Chucho and his bandmates became founding members of Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna, together with many other well-known Cuban musicians. This all-star big band would back singers such as Elena Burke and Omara Portuondo. In 1973, Chucho along with other members of the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna founded Irakere, an ensemble that bridged songo and Afro-Cuban jazz. He would simultaneously continue his solo career, eventually signing with Blue Note Records, which allowed him to get international exposure. As a result, Chucho&#x27;s work has received universal critical acclaim from the media, winning seven Grammy awards.

Chucho&#x27;s father, Bebo, who attained a legendary status as the pianist and director of the Tropicana Club orchestra and Orquesta Sabor de Cuba, fled Cuba in 1960, and did not record music again until the 1990s. In the late 1990s, Chucho decided to focus on his solo career, and his son Chuchito replaced him as the pianist/director of Irakere. Chucho and Bebo occasionally played together until the latter&#x27;s death in 2013. Since 2010, Chucho performs with a backing band known as the Afro-Cuban Messengers.

Chucho has spent much of his time teaching younger generations, either in his homeland of Cuba at the Havana National school (with many famous musicians such as Herbie Hancock), or elsewhere.
Chucho is the father of six children: Chuchito Valdés Cortes, Emilio Valdés Cortes, Yousi Valdés Torres, Leyanis Valdés Reyes, Jessie Valdés Reyes, and Julian Valdés Salcedo.

== Awards and honors ==
Chucho has won four Grammy Awards as a solo artist:
* Best Latin Jazz Album in 2001 for his album &quot;Live at the Village Vanguard&quot;
* Best Latin Jazz Album in 2010 for &quot;Juntos Para Siempre&quot;, with his father Bebo Valdés
* Best Latin Jazz Album in 2011 for &quot;Chucho&#x27;s Steps&quot;, with the Afro-Cuban Messengers
* Best Latin Jazz Album in 2017 for &quot;Tribute to Irakere: Live in Marciac&quot;.

Other albums of his nominated for a Latin Jazz Album Grammy include &quot;Bele Bele en la Habana&quot; (1999), &quot;Briyumba Palo Congo – Religion of the Congo&quot; (2000) and &quot;New Conceptions&quot; (2004).

He has also been part of two ensembles who have won Grammy Awards:
* Best Latin Recording in 1980 for the album &quot;Irakere&quot; by Irakere
* Best Latin Jazz Performance in 1998 for the album &quot;Habana&quot;, by Roy Hargrove&#x27;s Crisol

He has won the following Latin Grammy Awards:
* Best Latin Jazz/Jazz Album in 2004 for &quot;New Conceptions&quot;
* Best Latin Jazz/Jazz Album in 2009 for &quot;Juntos Para Siempre&quot;
* Best Latin Jazz/Jazz Album in 2019 for &quot;Jazz Batá 2&quot;

On October 16, 2006, Chucho Valdés was nominated Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

In May 2011, Chucho Valdés was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music

In Abril 2022, Chucho Valdés was awarded Best Latin Jazz Album Mirror Mirror with Eliane Elias &amp; Chick Corea @grammyaward2022 Best Latin Jazz

<text>The Massachusett language is an Algonquian language of the Algic language family that was formerly spoken by several peoples of eastern coastal and southeastern Massachusetts. In its revived form, it is spoken in four Wampanoag communities. The language is also known as or (Wampanoag), and historically as , Indian or .

The language is most notable for its community of literate Native Americans and for the number of translations of religious texts into the language. John Eliot&#x27;s translation of the Christian Bible in 1663 using the Natick dialect, known as &quot;Mamusse Wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God&quot;, was the first printed in the Americas, the first Bible translated by a non-native speaker, and one of the earliest examples of a Bible translation into a previously unwritten language. Literate Native American ministers and teachers taught literacy to the elites and other members of their communities, influencing a widespread acceptance. This is attested in the numerous court petitions, church records, praying town administrative records, notes on book margins, personal letters, and widespread distribution of other translations of religious tracts throughout the colonial period.

The dialects of the language were formerly spoken by several peoples of southern New England, including all the coastal and insular areas of eastern Massachusetts, as well as southeastern New Hampshire, the southernmost tip of Maine and eastern Rhode Island, and it was also a common second or third language across most of New England and portions of Long Island. The use of the language in the intertribal communities of Christian converts, called praying towns, resulted in its adoption by some groups of Nipmuc and Pennacook.

The revitalization of the language began in 1993 when Jessie Little Doe Baird (Mashpee Wampanoag) launched the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project (WLRP). It has successfully reintroduced the revived Wampanoag dialect to the Mashpee, Aquinnah, Assonet, and Herring Pond communities of the Wampanoag of Cape Cod and the Islands, with a handful of children who are growing up as the first native speakers in more than a century.

==Classification==
===Position of Massachusett within the Algic languages===
Massachusett is in the Eastern branch of Algonquian languages, which comprises all the known Algonquian languages spoken from the Canadian Maritimes southward to the Carolinas. Within the Eastern divisions, Massachusett clusters with the Southern New England Algonquian (SNEA) languages. If considered a dialect of SNEA, it is an SNEA &#x27;N-dialect.&#x27; Other Eastern language divisions include the Abenakian languages spoken to the immediate north and the Delawaran languages to the west and southwest of the SNEA region. South of the Delawaran languages are the Nanticokan languages of the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River watershed, the Powhatan languages of coastal Virginia and the Carolina Algonquian languages of the Carolinas. The Eastern languages are the only genetic grouping to have emerged from Algonquian, as all the languages descend from Proto-Eastern Algonquian (PEA), which differentiated likely due to isolation from other Algonquian speakers due to the presence of large pockets of Iroquoian and Siouan languages and the Appalachian Mountains. The Central and Plains, however, are groupings based on areal features and geographical proximity.

===Relationship within SNEA===
The SNEA languages were all mutually intelligible to some extent, existing in a dialect chain or linkage, with the boundaries between quite distinct dialects blurred by a series of transitional varieties. All the SNEA languages, including Massachusett, can be differentiated from other Eastern branch languages by several shared innovations including the merger of PEA *&quot;hr&quot; and *&quot;hx&quot; into *&quot;hš&quot;, palatization of PEA *&quot;k&quot; to SNEA *&quot;ty&quot; where it occurs after PEA *&quot;ē&quot; and some instances of PA *&quot;i&quot;, palatization of PEA *&quot;sk&quot; in similar environments to *&quot;hč&quot; and word-final PEA *&quot;r&quot; merging into *&quot;š&quot;.

Within SNEA, Massachusett shares the most similarity to Narragansett and Nipmuc, its immediate neighbors, with a handful of lexical items indicating an east-west division. For example, the word &#x27;fish&#x27; is () in Massachusett, In Nipmuc and Narragansett , all likely pronounced similarly to from Proto-Algonquian *, contrasting with Mohegan-Pequot and Quiripi which derives from a local stem * and an ancient alternative stem for &#x27;fish,&#x27; *, likely Proto-Western SNEA * . Although Nipmuc is close to Massachusett, it is conservative in that it retains more noun and verb finals that are truncated in most environments in other SNEA languages.

====N-dialect====
The most defining feature of Massachusett in comparison to other SNEA languages is the outcome of in reflexes of PEA *&quot;r&quot;, itself a merger of Proto-Algonquian *&quot;r&quot; and *&quot;θ&quot;. Massachusett and its dialects always have and thus its classification as an SNEA N-dialect. This becomes in the Y-dialects of Narragansett, Eastern and Western Niantic and Mohegan-Pequot, in the R-dialects of Quiripi and in the L-dialect Nipmuc language.
 Only appears with diminutive as &#x27;puppy,&#x27; more common word is .
 Possibly Williams&#x27; recording of the Coweset dialect.

====Lack of syncope====
&#x27;Abenakian syncope&#x27; was an areal feature that had spread from the Abenakian languages to Mahican, a Delawarean language, and was beginning to spread into SNEA during the early colonial period. The feature was obligatory in the Quiripi, Unquachoag, Montauk, Mohegan and Pequot dialects of the Long Island sound, frequent in Nipmuc and mostly absent in Massachusett and Narragansett. For example the &#x27;Fox Sachem&#x27; of the Pequot was known to late-stage speakers as whereas the English name &#x27;Uncas&#x27; likely preserves an older dialectal and pre-syncopated stage pronunciation of , cf. Massachusett () , indicating that the transition was not complete in New England when the English colonists arrived. When it appears in Massachusett documents, it seems to be indicative of dialectal features or in forced situations, such as sung versions of the Massachusett translations of the &quot;Psalms of David&quot; in the &quot;Massachusee Psalter.&quot;

In dialects that permitted syncopation, it generally involved the deletion of , and occasionally , usually at the end of a word, after a long vowel, or metrical factors such as the Algonquian stress rules which deleted these vowels in weakly stressed positions. In Massachusett, there are some syncopated forms such as , &#x27;cormorant,&#x27; and , &#x27;his/her blood,&#x27; but these are rare instances compared to the more common () and () , respectively, that also appear in Eliot&#x27;s translations. Although a clear dialectal feature, unfortunately, the majority of documents are of unknown authorship and geographic origin.

====Locative vs. ====
The locative suffix, as in &#x27;Massachusett&#x27; with prevails in a three-to-one ratio over the older variant in the Massachusett-language documents, indicating it was a dialectal feature. In place names of Algonquian origin in Massachusetts, the Massachusett innovation covers most of the Massachusett, Pawtucket, Wampanoag and Coweset areas and also seems to have spread into Narragansett and Nipmuc. However, the Nantucket and Nauset were historically , as were many dialects of Nipmuc and likely in Narragansett, although it is also very likely to have been interchangeable in some dialects. The majority of the people of Natick also mainly used the older variant despite Eliot using the alternate form in his translations. This may be explained by the fact that the original settlers of Natick were Massachusett people from Neponset, but after King Philip&#x27;s War, the community attracted many Nipmuc whose dialects generally prefer .

As Eliot employed the form in his translations, this form spread as the &#x27;standard&#x27; in writing. Many instances seem to have been standardized by colonial mapmakers and Indian translators themselves. For instance, the colonists referred to a hill that once existed as Hassunek or Hassunet Hill, but the name survives today as Assonet Street in Worcester. Similarly, Asnacomet Pond, in a formerly Nipmuc-language area, was recorded as &#x27;Asacancomic in the older colonial sources. This &#x27;correction&#x27; stops at the Connecticut River, as most place names from areas associated with Mahican, such as Hoosic, Housatonic, Mahkeenak, Quassuck and Mananosick and Pocomtuc examples such as Podatuck, Pocumtuck, Sunsick, Norwottuck and Pachassic noticeably lack this feature. Nevertheless, because of the wide dialectal variation, the alone is not diagnostic of Massachusett.

===Names===
====Endonyms====
The traditional method of referring to the language was simply () , &#x27;that which they [can] speak to each other&#x27; Dialects or languages that were harder to understand were () , &#x27;difficult language&#x27;, contrasting with () ,&#x27;foreign&#x27; or &#x27;strange language.&#x27;

When needed to refer to specific people or places, the name of the people or place was followed by () to indicate &#x27;its people&#x27;s language&#x27; or &#x27;that which the people speak&#x27;. In the colonial period, the language was generally known as () , &#x27;language of the Massachusett (region)&#x27; or () , &#x27;language of the Massachusett (people).&#x27; was the correct short form in traditional Massachusett usage to refer to the people and the language, despite the adoption of &quot;Massachusett&quot; in English, hence the translation of the &quot;Massachusett Psalter&quot; as . The people and language take their name from the sacred hill, known in English as Great Blue Hill. The name derives from (), &#x27;big,&#x27; &#x27;sacred,&#x27; or &#x27;great,&#x27; () , &#x27;hill&#x27; (literally &#x27;small mountain&#x27;) and the locative suffix (). The syncopation of the diminutive () to was common in dialects and rapid or relaxed speech, thus the colonial form as opposed to careful Massachusett ().

The Wampanoag tribes affiliated with the WLRP refer to the language as (), possibly back-rendered into the colonial spelling as , &#x27;Wampanoag language&#x27; to refer not only to the varieties used historically by the Wampanoag people, but also to the Massachusett language as a whole. The name derives from (), &#x27;east&#x27; or &#x27;dawn,&#x27; and thus signifies &#x27;language of the easterners&#x27; or &#x27;language of the people of the dawn.&#x27; Modern speakers of the revived dialect shorten this to () (Wampanoag), even though this technically refers only to the people.

====Exonyms====
The English settlers of the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies initially referred to Massachusett as the &quot;Indian language&quot;, at first because they were unaware of the ethnic and linguistic boundaries between peoples. &quot;Massachusett&quot; was adopted as a general term, although due to the influence of the Indian mission and the success of the Praying Town of Natick, &quot;Natick&quot; also was a common reference to the language, especially in written form. In the Plymouth Colony, both &quot;Massachusett&quot; and &quot;Wampanoag&quot;, especially since the colony covered most of their traditional territory, were in general use. These three terms remain the most common way of referring to the language in English today, supplanting older colonial names such as &quot;Nonantum&quot;, &quot;Pokanoket&quot; or &quot;Aberginian&quot;.

In more technical contexts, Massachusett is often known by names referring to its pan-ethnic usage, such as &quot;Massachusett-Wampanoag&quot;, &quot;Wampanoag-Massachusett&quot;, &quot;Massachusett-Coweset&quot; or &quot;Massachusett-Narragansett&quot;, although the majority of linguists consider Narragansett a separate albeit closely related language. Due to the heavy scholarly, cultural and media attention surrounding the revival of the language under the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project of Jessie Little Doe Baird, and also because the Wampanoag far outnumber Massachusett people, the use of &#x27;Wampanoag&#x27; or its revived form &#x27;Wôpanâak&#x27; to refer to the entire language is increasing.

==Geographic distribution==
Until the end of the 17th century, Massachusett was a locally important language. In its simplified pidgin form, it was adopted as a regional lingua franca of New England and Long Island. As a native language, its dialects were spoken by several peoples inhabiting the coastal and insular regions of Massachusetts, adjacent portions of northern and southeastern Rhode Island, and portions of southeastern and coastal New Hampshire, with transitional dialects historically extending as far north as the southernmost tip of Maine. Due to the waves of epidemics that killed off most of the Native peoples, competition with the large influx of English colonists for land and resources, and the great upheaval in the wake of King Philip&#x27;s War, by the beginning of the 18th century, the language and its speakers had contracted into a shrinking land base and population, concentrated in the former praying towns of Natick and Ponkapoag and the larger Wampanoag, isolated Wampanoag settlements on the islands of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket and Mashpee on the mainland. After another century of extreme assimilation pressure, intermarriage, and the necessity of learning and using English in daily life, the language disappeared from Massachusett-speaking communities by the 19th century, with the very last speakers dying off at the century&#x27;s end on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

Contemporary speakers are restricted to the area surrounding four communities on Cape Cod and the Islands and nearby regions just a little &quot;off Cape&quot; including Mashpee, Aquinnah, Freetown, and Cedarville, Plymouth which are the home of the federally recognized Mashpee and Aquinnah tribes and Assonet and Herring Pond communities that participate in the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project.

Other groups with some ancestry from Massachusett-speaking peoples include the tribes that absorbed the refugees of King Philip&#x27;s War such as the Abenaki () of northern New Hampshire, Vermont and Québec; the Schaghticoke () of western Connecticut along the border with New York and the Brothertown or Brotherton () and Stockbridge-Munsee (-), both amalgamations of peoples of southern New England and elsewhere that relocated to Wisconsin.

===Dialects=== 

The Southern New England Algonquian languages existed in a dialect continuum, with boundaries between languages and dialects softened by transitional speech varieties. Small differences existed between neighboring communities, but these increased with distance and isolation, and speakers from opposite ends of the continuum would have slightly more difficulties with inter-comprehension, but all the SNEA languages and dialects were mutually intelligible to some extent.

Numerous dialects were lost during the depopulation of the Native peoples due to outbreaks of disease and the chaos of King Philip&#x27;s War. Although afflicted by several epidemics caused by exposure to pathogens to which they had no previous exposure, the outbreak of leptospirosis in 1616–19 and a virulent smallpox epidemic in 1633 nearly cleared the land of Native Americans. The first outbreak hit the densely populated coastal areas with mortality rates as high as 90 percent, but the latter epidemic had a broader impact. The epidemics opened the Massachusett-speaking peoples to attacks from regional rivals, such as the Narragansett and Pennacook and historic enemies such as the Tarratine (Abenaki) and Mohawk, as well as removed any resistance to colonial expansion. The war caused many Native peoples to flee the area, and remnant populations regrouped, merging dialect communities and disparate peoples.

Knowledge of the spoken language and its diversity ceased with the death of the last speakers of SNEA languages. Most had ceased to be functional, everyday languages of the Native American communities by the end of the eighteenth century, if not sooner, and all were extinct by the dawning of the twentieth century. Most linguistic knowledge relies on word lists and passing mention in colonial sources, which can only provide very limited understanding. Written records do show some variation, but dialect leveling was brought about with the introduction of a &quot;de facto&quot; standard written language as used in Eliot&#x27;s translation of the Bible and several primers and catechisms used to teach literacy, were produced with the aid of Native American translators, editors and interpreters from Natick, and was based on its speech.

The employment of numerous literate Native Americans across Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies&#x27; Praying towns, many from Natick or had studied there for some time, helped elevate the spoken language as well, as it was recited when Bible passages were read aloud during sermons or any written document. Experience Mayhew, himself bilingual in the language and from a direct line of missionaries to the Native Americans of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, where the speech was said to be completely unintelligible to neighboring Wampanoag from the mainland noted that &#x27;... most of the little differences betwixt them have been happily Lost, and our Indians Speak, but especially write much as the Natick do.&#x27;

Small differences can be ascertained from the written sources, but most records indicate that the Massachusett-speaking people spoke very similarly to each other. Daniel Gookin, who had accompanied Eliot on his tours of the Praying towns, noted that the Pawtucket, Pokanoket (Mashpee Wampanoag), and Massachusett all spoke essentially the same language. Ives Goddard, in quoting the ethnopolitical boundaries as listed by John R. Swanton or Frederick Webb Hodge lists five dialects, Natick, North Shore, Wampanoag, Nauset and Coweset which correspond to the Massachusett, Pawtucket, Wampanoag, Nauset, and Coweset peoples, although the Nauset may have just been an isolated sub-tribe of the Wampanoag.

===Derived languages===

====Massachusett Pidgin====

Several regional pidgin varieties of major Eastern Algonquian languages are attested in colonial records, including those based on Mahican, Munsee, Powhatan, and in New England, Massachusett. These pidgin varieties all featured reduced vocabulary and grammar simplifications. These pidgin varieties were used as the medium of communication between speakers of dialects or languages with limited mutual intelligibility.

Massachusett Pidgin was used as a common language over New England and Long Island and was likely used with the foreign English settlers. For instance, Edward Winslow describes a situation in his 1624 &quot;Good News from New England&quot; where he and a few other Pilgrims were able to converse and understand the Native Americans well, but the Native Americans would speak to each other at times in a similar but baffling tongue, either as their natural language but also probably to restrict information exchange with the foreign English settlers. The pidgin variety varied from Massachusett in the following ways:

Simplification of vocabulary
* () instead of Massachusett or syncopated and () 

Use of non-Massachusett vocabulary
* Abenakian (*) instead of Massachusett (), although both forms are derived from Proto-Algonquian .
* Abenakian or Unami () instead of Massachusett () , although both forms descend from Proto-Algoquian .

Reduction of verbs to the intransitive inanimate
* ( literally &#x27;to see it&#x27;) instead of Massachusett () , transitive animate &#x27;I see (someone or something &quot;alive&quot;)&#x27;. This can be seen in the example of , &#x27;I shall never see Winslow again&#x27; but literally &#x27;Never I again see it Winslow.&#x27; 
* &#x27;I see (something or some object)&#x27; in Massachusett proper would be () 

Although the use of Massachusett Pidgin declined in favor of Massachusett Pidgin English, especially once the English settlers established their foothold and saw little use in the language of a people whose lands they were usurping and were dying off from disease. Interest in Massachusett Pidgin and other Algonquian pidgin languages comes from the fact that they were likely the main source of words from the Algonquian languages. For instance, the early Pilgrims and Puritans only make references to &quot;wigwams&quot; and never &quot;s&quot;. Similarly, &quot;sagamore&quot; was in common frequency as in the early English of New England.

====Massachusett Pidgin English====

A handful of Native Americans had rudimentary knowledge of English through occasional contacts with English seafarers, adventurers, fishermen and traders for a few decades before the first permanent English colonial settlement in New England at Plymouth. When the Pilgrims established their outpost, they were greeted in English by Samoset, originally an Abenaki of coastal Maine, and Tisquantum (&#x27;Squanto&#x27;), a local Wôpanâak, but both of their home villages were also wiped out by an epidemic caused by infectious agents unknown in the New World. Tisquantum was abducted by the crew of English vessel, sold into slavery in Spain, mysteriously found his way to London where gained employment on English explorations of the North American coast and later escaped and took up residence in a neighboring Wôpanâak village.

As the Native Americans were already in a multi-dialectal, multilingual society, English was adopted quite quickly albeit with strong influences of Massachusett lexicon, grammar and likely pronunciation. As the number of English settlers grew and quickly outnumbered the local peoples, Natives grew to use English more often, and the settlers also used it to communicate with the Native Americans. The resulting pidgin was probably the vector of transmission of many of the so-called &#x27;wigwam words,&#x27; i.e., local Algonquian loan words, that were once prevalent in the English spoken in the Americas.

Massachusett Pidgin English was mostly English in vocabulary, but included numerous loan words, grammar features and calques of Massachusett Pidgin. Amongst the Native Americans, it co-existed with the use of the &#x27;standard&#x27; Massachusett language, local speech and other dialects or languages, Massachusett Pidin and English. As the Native Americans began a quick process of language shift at the end of the eighteenth century, it is likely that Massachusett Pidgin English lost its native features and merged with the evolution of local speech, one of the varieties of Eastern New England English or even General American of the majority non-Native Americans of the region in a process similar to decreolization. Massachusett Pidgin English had the following characteristics:

Massachusett loan words (shared Massachusett Pidgin vocabulary)
* from Massachusett /() (&#x27;food&#x27;) via Massachusett Pidgin (&#x27;food&#x27;).
* from Massachusett for &#x27;young man.&#x27;
* (&#x27;good&#x27;) from Massachusett /() (&#x27;it is good&#x27;).
Generalized pronouns
* Use of &#x27;me&#x27; for both &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;me.&#x27;
SNEA N-dialect interference
* English &quot;lobster&quot; and English surname &quot;Winslow&quot; with Massachusett Pidgin English and , respectively, substitution of for of English.
* English &quot;Frenchmen&quot; adopted as , substitution of for of English.
Calques
* &quot;all one this&quot;, calque of Massachusett Pidgin (&#x27;like this&#x27;).
* &quot;big&quot;, calque of 
* ReduplicationE.g. &quot;by and by&quot; (&#x27;soon&#x27;)
Use of Massachusett animate plural suffix for domesticated animals introduced by the English
* &quot;/&quot;(), (&#x27;cows&#x27;).
* &quot;/&quot;(), (&#x27;horses&#x27;).
* &quot;/&quot;(), (&#x27;pigs&#x27;).

Examples of Massachusett Pidgin English
* (&#x27;What an Englishman says is what he thinks&#x27;).
* (Away be gone coats?) (&#x27;Do you have any coats?&#x27;).
* (&#x27;Greetings, friend&#x27;) , &#x27;friend,&#x27; from Massachusett &quot;/&quot;().
* (&#x27;[He went] not too far [to] fetch the pigs&#x27;).

==History==

===Pre-colonial history===
 Although human history in New England probably dates back to 10000 BC, when Paleo-Indians entered the tundra exposed by the retreat of the Wisconsin Glacier at the end of the Pleistocene, glottochronology and some corroborating archaeological evidence traces the history of the language to the Northwest Plateau region, or the areas of the Pacific Northwest separated from the coastal plains by high mountains, around the middle and upper regions surrounding the Columbia River. This area is likely the Urheimat associated with Proto-Algic speakers. Migrations, cultural influences and language shift led to the displacement by speaker of the Kalapuyan (†), Na-Dene, Palaihnihan, Plateau Penutian, Salishan, etc., as well as languages of the coast which may have had a broader distribution. The Algic languages were displaced from this area with coastal areas of northern California home of the distantly-related, only known non-Algonquian Algic languages, Wiyot and Yurok.

A descendant of Proto-Algic, Proto-Algonquian, diverged and spread east, likely around 1000 BC, the ancestor of the Algonquian languages which form the bulk of known Algic languages, spoken in the northern and eastern parts of the United States and Canada east of the Rockies all the way to the coast. The exact location where Proto-Algonquian was spoken is likely in the Northwest Plateau region, possibly Idaho where the westernmost Algonquian languages are spoken, but multiple regions between there and just west of the Great Lakes have been posited. Algonquian languages splintered off as they moved eastward, probably facilitated by the spread of the mound-builder cultures that developed in the Adena (1000–200 BC) and Hopewell (200–500 AD) cultural periods.

Circa 1000 AD, Proto-Eastern Algonquian emerged in what is now southern Ontario, and east, where the daughter Eastern Algonquian languages later spread from Atlantic Canada south to North Carolina. This period is marked by small-scale migrations into New England, likely introducing the beginnings of Three Sisters agriculture and influences of Iroquoian pottery. Since there is not evidence of large migrations, the spread of Eastern Algonquian seems to be more to the culturally advanced migrants triggering language shift since the last large movement of populations was during the Archaic Period (8000–2000 BC).

The development of Eastern Algonquian was likely a consequence of its isolation, separated from other Algonquian languages by speakers of Iroquoian and Siouan-Catawban languages.

A few centuries later, Proto-Southern New England Algonquian (PSNEA) diverged into the SNEA languages. This development might coincide with the success of new strains of the tropical maize plant better suited to northern climes and the increased use of coastal resources around 1300 AD, during the Late Woodland Period. The improvement to agriculture supported large populations in the arable lands near the coast or along the larger rivers. Population movements seem to indicate the spread of the language from southeastern New England, spreading it into Connecticut and northward. Competition over resources, more sedentary and permanent habitations and an influx of small migrations from the north and southwest probably fueled territoriality which may be evidenced by newer pottery styles with restricted local production areas. Shortly after this time, the languages, peoples and technologies would have likely been recognizable to the Europeans that began visiting the coasts at the end of the sixteenth century.

===Early colonial period===
The first English colonial settlements, the Plymouth Colony by the Pilgrims in 1620, and the Massachusetts Bay Colony by the Puritans in 1629, both were founded in Massachusett-language speaking territory. The colonists depended on the Native Americans for survival, and some learned how to communicate with them for trade. As the population of English settlers increased with further Puritan migrations, and the Native Americans became outnumbered, moves to assimilate the Native Americans were enacted. With colonial backing and funding from the Society for the Propagation of the Bible, missionaries such as John Eliot, Thomas Mayhew and his descendants amongst the Wampanoag, and Roger Williams began to learn the local languages and convert the natives. Eliot began preaching at Nonantum (now Newton, Massachusetts), and starting 1651, established communities of converts, known as praying towns or Indian plantations, where the Native Americans were encouraged to adopt European customs and language, practice Christianity, and accept colonial jurisdiction. Eliot printed a Bible in 1663, and the Native Americans at the praying towns began to adopt the orthography of the Natick dialect Bible.

===Translation and literature===
John Eliot, after beginning his mission to the Indians, quickly saw the need for literacy so that the new converts could experience Biblical inspiration on their own. With the help of local interpreters and Eliot&#x27;s frequent contacts with the Native Americans, he became fluent in the language and began writing the sounds he heard in Natick in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; fashion, using the conventions of English spelling. By 1651, Eliot produced a hand-written catechism he used for teaching literacy and religion at Natick, followed by a translation of the &quot;Book of Psalms&quot; which was hand-copied. A small group of literate Native Americans began teaching it to others, and Eliot established a school to train Native American missionaries who were literate and able to read these materials.

As the Native Americans gained literacy and Eliot&#x27;s notoriety grew, funding was given from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England. The Society, which supported Calvinist and Congregationalist missions banned under the influence of Anglo-Catholic monarchs and leaders of the Church of England. In 1655, the Indian College of Harvard University, its first brick building, was constructed and a printing press and materials were sent. Eliot began right away, printing copies of the &quot;Book of Genesis&quot; and the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot; that same year. In 1663, Eliot printed the completed translation of the Bible, his monumental achievement. Eliot continued to print translations, until his death in 1690.

After his death, the Society commissioned other missionaries, most notably Experience Mayhew, who, as a child in long line of missionaries to the Wampanoag of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, was fluent in the language and his works were popular with the Native Americans for its consistent spelling and adherence to more natural spoken style of the Native Americans themselves. Other missionaries commissioned include Samuel Danforth, an assistant to John Eliot; Grindal Rawson, minister to the Praying Indians of Wacentug (Uxbridge, Massachusetts); John Cotton, Jr., preacher to Wôpanâak of Plymouth, Mashpee and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and his nephew, Cotton Mather, influential Puritan theologian. As the colonies came under direct rule, and interest in the Indian mission waned, the Society last commissioned a reprint of Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;Indiane Primer asuh Negonneuyeuuk&quot; in 1747. The end of the missionary translations impacted, but did not finish off, Native literacy, which continued until the close of the eighteenth century. The following is a list of the Society&#x27;s publications and their year of printing:
 The 1662 edition was a revised and longer version.
 These revised editions were completed with the assistance of John Cotton, Jr. and include the &#x27;Leaf of Rules,&#x27; a series of rules to be followed by Native Americans in accordance to English law and custom and Christian tradition.
 Consists of a reworked edition of the metrical with a short catechism. Printed both with and separately.
 Half-completed, but was never finished or published.
 Although in English, it includes a wealth of information about the language, especially its grammatical structure. Some copies were bound with later versions of &quot;Psalter&quot; or and likely distributed to other missionaries working amongst the Native Americans.
 Although in English, these works were distributed to Native American missionaries to help improve their ministry.
 Started in Eliot in 1664, but was completed by Grindal Rawson.
 Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;Massachusee Psalter&quot; consisted of a retranslated , &#x27;Songs of David&#x27; (&quot;Book of Psalms&quot;) and a retranslated (&quot;Gospel According to John&quot;).
 The address to the Native Americans was appended to a copy of Danforth&#x27;s sermon, &quot;The Woeful Effects of Drunkenness&quot;.
 This was likely never published and no copies survive, but it was said to be popular in use as a catechism by the Native Americans who took to the English version when no Native American copies could be found.
 Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;Indiane Primer&quot; was a retranslation of Eliot&#x27;s original primer, also bound to copies of Grindal Rawson&#x27;s translation of .
 Published in Mather&#x27;s &quot;India Christiana&quot;.

===Native American translators, missionaries and the spread of literacy===


A team of Native translators and interpreters assisted Eliot and the other missionaries with their translations, even though most of their work was uncredited. Eliot himself relied on Cockenoe, his servant from Long Island who spoke a related SNEA language and was able to interpret for Eliot; Job Nesutan, who was very proficient in writing and reading; John Sassamon, an orphan raised in the households of English settlers and later became an important interpreter between the settlers and Native Americans, and James Wawâus Printer, who learned the printing presses and was said by Eliot to have been the most prolific. When Mayhew was commissioned to provide missionary translations, he was assisted by Printer, Neesnumin and Hiacoomes, the first convert to Christianity on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

Some of Eliot&#x27;s converts became missionaries, who in turn spread Christianity and literacy so that within twenty years of Eliot&#x27;s first printed translations, literacy went from none to one in three Natives of the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies.

At least a handful of Native Americans attended classes to prepare them for assuming the Indian mission at Harvard University prior to the construction of the Indian College, such as James Printer and John Sassamon that would later assist Eliot with his translations, and Jethro, a Nashaway (northern Nipmuc) who later was preacher at Wamesit. Students would later include Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck and Joel Hiacoomes, son of Hiacoomes, two Wampanoag from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard; Eleazar, a Wampanoag; and John Wampas, a Nipmuc who was later appointed by his people to protect their rights and land with his bilingual talent, but who betrayed his people to curry favor from English settlers. The last student, attending after the building was razed, was Brian Larnell, a Nipmuc. Except for the pre-Indian College students and John Wampas, the others contracted illnesses and perished, possibly from close proximity to English settlers in an urban setting exposing them to the infections against which they lacked immunity.

Natick served as a seminary, with a school where Eliot, and later his Native American disciples, would instruct literacy in Massachusett, Christian religion and European culture before serving as official interpreters, administrators of the Praying towns or elders of the Indian churches, often recruited from the tribal ėlite. Armed with literacy and copies of the missionary translations, these Native Americans began instructing others. At Natick, Eliot passed on his role as teacher to Monesquassin, who in turn taught it to others. Records from the seventeenth and eighteenth century indicate that quite a few Native Americans were involved, mainly those from or with kinship connections to Natick, which combined with that dialect&#x27;s use in Eliot&#x27;s translations, leveled dialectal differences. Many of these Native Americans are named in the records, such as the Ahatons of Ponkapoag and the Speens of Natick, Joseph Tuckawillipin of Hassanamessit, Simon Beckom of Wamesit, Samuel Church at Watuppa and Isaac Jeffrey at Manomet and Herring Pond.

By 1674, a request for literacy rates of the Native Americans in the Plymouth Colony by Daniel Gookin indicated that 29% of the converted Native Americans could read and 17% could write the Massachusett language. With its own church, the highest rates for literacy were found in the villages of Codtanmut, Ashmuit and Weesquobs—all within Mashpee—where 59% of the population could read and 31% could write. The general rate was likely the same or higher in the Praying towns of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. These Native Americans, due to their important status as members of prominent tribal families and proficiency, not only took over the mission and served as deacons, elders, ministers and preachers but also as teachers, councilmen, jurors, constables and other administrative functions in the Praying towns. Literacy continued to be an important part of the Native American communities until the 1770s, however, its role diminished as younger generations of Native Americans switched to using English and fewer and fewer Indian churches remained under Native American control with Native American congregants and preachers, in part because of the upheavals of war, loss of land and lack of economic incentives to stay in the Praying town.

===Extinction===
The use of the written language declined over the course of the eighteenth century. In Natick, where Native American literacy began, the last town records in the language were written by Thomas Waban (Weegramomenit), son of Waban, in 1720. The last document to survive in the language are the records of the Congregational Church of Gay Head, recording the marriage of John Joel and Mary Tallmon by the minister Zachary Hossueit, in 1771. The last known epigraphic evidence of the written language is its use on the now damaged tombstone of Silas Paul, another Native American minister of Gay Head, in 1787. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some Native Americans were literate up until the middle of the nineteenth century, although no documents from this period survive.

The spoken language remained in vibrant use in the 1750s on the mainland and as late as the 1770s in the larger, more isolated Wampanoag communities of the islands of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket. By 1798, only one speaker of advanced age was found in Natick. The language survived on Nantucket until the death of the widow Dorcas Honorable in 1855. On Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, the language survived the longest. In 1808, a church official named Elisha Clap writing about the small congregation of the Baptist minister Zachariah Howwaswee (Hossueit) remarked, &#x27;Only a few aged Indians, who do not understand English, attend his meeting, as he preaches in the native language ...&#x27; Howwaswee continued preaching until his death sometime in the 1830s. It is not known when the last speakers perished, but Tamsen Weekes, who died in 1890 at the age of 90, was likely one of the last fluent speakers. Studies of the Wampanoag tribe in the 1920s did not find any native speakers, but only those who remembered small bits of the language.

The language declined for several reasons. The population of speakers plummeted due to the effects of virgin soil epidemics of smallpox, measles, diphtheria and scarlet fever that continued to claim indigenous lives well into the nineteenth century, but began with a particularly severe outbreak of leptospirosis in 1619 that claimed the lives of up to 90% of coastal populations where Massachusett-language speakers resided. This reduced their ability to resist neighboring tribes, such as the Mohawk and Tarratine, and the influx of English settlers.

War also greatly reduced the population. The ravages of King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–76) is believed to have reduced the population by 40%, due to executions, retaliatory attacks and displacement. Many of the Praying Indians that remained neutral were rounded up and left on islands in Boston Harbor where many perished from disease, starvation and exposure to the elements. Others were sold into slavery in the West Indies. Many of the indigenous people decided to leave, seeking safety with the Abenaki to the north or the Mahican to the west, where they would eventually assimilate into the host tribe. Many men were called to fight alongside the English colonists against the French and their Native American allies during the French and Indian Wars, a series of conflicts between 1688 and 1763 as well as the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). The gender imbalance led to increased intermarriage between Native American women and black or white men outside the speech community.

Loss of land forced language shift in other ways. Only Mashpee and Aquinnah remained in Native American hands by the end of the nineteenth century. The Native Americans were no longer able to support themselves on agriculture and subsistence as their lands were lost due to encroachment and land sales. This forced men to seek employment as laborers, mariners or whalers in coastal cities whereas women and children found employment as domestics in White households or as peddlers of baskets. The shrinking communities were no longer able to support separate church congregations that traditionally used the language. The population also became a smaller and smaller minority with the growth in the population of descendants of English settlers and large-scale arrival of newcomers from Europe in the nineteenth century, exacerbating already existing assimilation pressures.

==Revival==
The language remained in use the longest in speech and writing in the isolated, insular Wôpanâak communities, but as its use slowly faded, many believed that it would return with the help of descendants of those who destroyed it. Massachusett-language documents in the form of land sales, leases and deeds are found in the oldest layer of city and town archives in Massachusetts. The petitions and complaints to the General Court of Massachusetts were often sent in English and in Massachusett. The records of the former Praying Town and now just town of Natick, Massachusetts, are in Massachusett from 1651 until 1720. The Native Americans also maintained their libraries of religious manuscripts and personal records even as the language ceased to be spoken, many of which were later sold to private collectors and ultimately are now in the possession of the Massachusetts Historical Society. In addition, all the Native American translations and original works by the English missionaries have been preserved.

The &quot;Natick Dictionary&quot;, published in 1903 and based on the work of Dr. James H. Trumbull, includes descriptions of vocabulary, mainly from Eliot&#x27;s Bible but also that of the other missionaries and Roger William&#x27;s &quot;A Key ...&quot;. The documents of the Native Americans were extensively analyzed by Ives Goddard and Kathleen Bragdon, with the 1988 release of &quot;Native Writings in Massachusett.&quot; Reconstructions of gaps in grammar, syntax, vocabulary and pronunciation could be filled by comparison with other related Algonquian languages or by reconstructions based on likely sound changes, such as George F. Aubin&#x27;s &quot;Proto-Algonquian Dictionary&quot; of 1975.

As acceptance and appreciation of Native American culture grew in the early twentieth century, the local peoples of southern New England began to reconnect through Pan-Native American movements and gatherings, adopting aspects of Plains Indian culture and sharing surviving aspects of traditional culture and language. Many Native Americans attended the Aquidneck Indian Council meetings in Providence, Rhode Island, or took part in the Indian Council of New England in 1923.

The anthropologist and Eastern Woodlands Culture expert Frank Speck visited the Wampanoag of Mashpee and tried to document the language, but was able to list only twenty words, acquiring them with great difficulty from five of the oldest members in the community. Similarly, Gladys Tantaquidgeon (Mohegan) visited the Wampanoag of Aquinnah. She was able to extract one hundred words from those of most advanced age, her success likely from her attempts to preserve her own language, which became extinct in 1908 with the death of her aunt, Dji&#x27;ts Bud dnaca. Gordon Day recorded a reading of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer from Chief Wild Horse, Clinton Mye Haynes (1894–1966) of Mashpee, in 1961. Wild Horse was likely one of the last language rememberers.

In 1993, Jessie Little Doe Baird, of the Mashpee Wampanoag, began the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project as a co-founder. She began her studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Working with Dr. Kenneth Hale and later Norvin Richards, Baird was able to reconstruct the pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary of the Native American documents and English missionary translations. Baird later published her thesis, &quot;Introduction to Wampanoag Grammar&quot; in 2000, the year she completed her Master&#x27;s in Algonquian Linguistics. The WLRP later expanded to include participants in the Ahquinnah, Herring Pond and Assonet tribes of the Wôpanâak. Since Kenneth Hale was a direct descendant of the missionary Roger Williams and Baird a direct descendant of Nathan Pocknett, who resisted conversion attempts, they fulfilled the Wôpanâak prophecy regarding the language&#x27;s revival.

==Current status==

In 2010, Baird was presented the MacArthur Foundation Genius Award in recognition of her language revival efforts. The following year, PBS aired portions of Anne Makepeace&#x27;s documentary &quot;Âs Nutayanyean-We Still Live Here&quot; as a segment on the program &quot;Independent Lens&quot;. The film highlighted Baird&#x27;s work, as well as interviews with members of the WLRP-participating tribes discussing the project&#x27;s history, reception, goals and the experiences as the language was revived in their communities.

In 2014, the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project was able to boast of a handful of children who were growing up as native speakers for the first time in over a century, 15 proficient speakers, two trained Algonquian linguists, a dictionary with approximately 12,000 entries at the time, pedagogical materials and a complete, non-English educational curriculum, and hundreds of students at various stages of language study. In addition, it has enabled a return of use of the language in cultural, spiritual and sacred expressions of Native American identity. The WLRP continues to host educational programs, language immersion summer camps and after-school sessions, and special language days with the four communities that participate.

Original plans for the Charter School, with plans to open in August 2015, were shelved, as organizers said they would not be able to meet the statutory requirement that their students comprise the lowest tenth percentile of MCAS scores. Jennifer Weston, who serves as the Immersion School Developer and as the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Language Department Director, said that &quot;Since we didn&#x27;t meet that statutory requirement, our application&#x27;s fate rested on two other groups being approved first.&quot; The decision was also influenced by the conflicting political climate: Republican Governor Charlie Baker proposed to lift the cap on charter schools, but a bill was being considered that was popular with teacher&#x27;s unions and public opinion hoping for a moratorium.

Instead, the WLRP opened , &#x27;Children&#x27;s House,&#x27; a language immersion school at the Montessori Academy of North Falmouth, Massachusetts, with a dozen students. Later in November 2016, the school was moved onto Mashpee Wampanoag tribal property, to be closer to Mashpee, from where most of the WLRP staff, instructors and students come. In 2013, it was estimated that 6% of the students of the Mashpee Public School district were from the Mashpee Wôpanâak tribe. The project also received a three-year grant, which will allow the school to expand to 35 students and train four Montessori-style teachers, but it is likely that the slots may have to be awarded by lottery, given the interest in the project and its closer proximity to a tribal region.

Wampanoag spokesmen have objected to aspects of the National Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Saints &amp; Strangers&quot; (2015), a two-part Thanksgiving mini-series that explored the early history of the English settlers and Native Americans in Massachusetts. Baird and Linda Coombs, director of the Aquinnah Wampanoag Cultural Center, initially helped National Geographic as language consultants. They were rebuffed when they asked for authority to review the script before filming, &quot;to ensure it was historically and culturally accurate and that any offensive material had been removed.&quot; When National Geographic refused to allow them to do that, the Wampanoag declined to participate. They said that the dialogue and cultural misconceptions were prejudiced, &quot;stereotypical&quot;, and misguided, and certain events in the resulting film were historically wrong. The production company hired a different language consultant and coach, who translated the dialogue into Western Abenaki. A National Geographic spokesman said the production had noted that this was a cousin language to the Wampanoag of the original people who encountered early English settlers. Baird said, &quot;To say that Abenaki is Wampanog is like saying Portuguese is Spanish ... Using the same language family like this is saying one Indian isn&#x27;t any different than another Indian. One language isn&#x27;t any different than another. It marginalizes an entire people.&quot;

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Massachusett consonants lack voicing and aspiration. Aspiration, or the puff of air released after a consonant, is common in English in initial consonants or for clarity and emphasis, but not the second element of consonant clusters or syllable-final positions. Thus, Massachusett is more akin to the in &quot;spin&quot; than the in &quot;pin&quot; . The unaspirated /p/ may sound voiced and confused with English . Massachusett does not seem to have made any distinctions between voiced and unvoiced consonants as they exist in English, and so the colonial alphabet used voiced-unvoiced pairings such as B/P, G/C-K, J/Ch, Z/S, D/T and G(w)/Q(u) interchangeably, although it is possible that some consonants were voiced as allophonic variations, or sounded voiced to the English missionaries. As voicing is not a phonemic part of the language, the modern alphabet has purged the voiced letters save proper and personal names and loanwords that have not yet been assimilated or replaced. A sound similar to the sound is found in UK English &quot;tune&quot;; it was often confused by missionary writers as and written with or . It can be approximated by pronouncing the &#x27;ti&#x27; in &quot;tiara&quot; rapidly. It can be confused with , which was used in the colonial and currently in the modern script to represent T followed by an &#x27;infected vowel&#x27; which together create the same sound with a short schwa, .

=== Vowels ===

The symmetric vowel inventory of Proto-Algonquian was reduced through mergers along the course of its development. Massachusett vowels can be divided into the long vowels , and ; the short vowels and and the nasal vowel , which may also be considered a long vowel as it is stressed and lengthened in speech as the other long vowels.

The language is rich in various vowel combinations and diphthongs created with final and , which are often productive verbal elements. Two vowels together usually indicate hiatus of two distinct sounds and not a true diphthong, e.g., English &quot;coagulate&quot; and &quot;naive&quot;. Thus, (), &#x27;to lift up,&#x27; is pronounced and not *. Nevertheless, combinations of vowels and vowel-glide consonant (semivowel) are particularly numerous, not limited to , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , etc.

Due to the wide variance of spelling, the vowels have been hardest to reconstruct for the language. The exact value is unknown, and the vowels , , and could have had values of , , , or , , . Some dialects may have differed in pronunciation, perhaps using the sounds and to represent the letters and .

==Grammar==

The Massachusett language shared several features in common with other Algonquian languages. Nouns have gender based on animacy, based on the world-view of the Native Americans on what has spirit versus what does not. A body would be animate, but the parts of the body are inanimate. Nouns are also marked for obviation, with nouns subject to the topic marked apart from nouns less relevant to the discourse. Personal pronouns distinguish three persons, two numbers (singular and plural), inclusive and exclusive first-person plural, and proximate/obviative third-persons. Nouns are also marked as absentative, especially when referring to lost items or deceased persons. Sentence structures are typically SVO or SOV, but deviation from strict word order does not alter the meaning due to the synthetic structure. Verbs are quite complex, and can be broken into four classes of verbs: animate-intransitive (AI), inanimate-intransitive (II), animate-transitive (AT), and inanimate-transitive (IT). Verbs are also prefixed and suffixed with various inflections, particles, and conjugations, so complex things can easily be described just by a verb.

==Alphabet==

The original alphabet devised by Eliot and used by the Native Americans of the mid-seventeenth till nineteenth centuries consisted of all 26 letters of the Latin alphabet as used in English, with the addition of the digraph as a separate letter, similar to its role in Spanish prior to the 1994 Spanish orthographical reforms. The digraph does not receive similar treatment. Vowels could be marked with the acute accent ( ´ ) to denote stress or long vowels or the circumflex ( ˆ ) used to indicate the nasal vowel , but despite this prescriptive use, most literate native speakers, and even Eliot, used them interchangeably. The double O ligature was used by Eliot primarily to indicate as opposed to the short vowel , analogous to writing &#x27; and &#x27; but &quot;cook&quot; and &quot;rook&quot;; however, was not considered a separate letter and often replaced with . , , and only occur in loan words. as the representation of the runic letter thorn () was used in Eliot&#x27;s time as a shorthand for , often written superscript or subscript in print to differentiate from . Although not included in the colonial alphabet, its use would likely have occurred in some English loan words especially from the oldest Native American documents. and , although not yet considered distinct letters in English of the seventeenth century, were treated as separate letters in Massachusett.

The alphabet in use by the Wôpanâak communities that participate in the language revival, the alphabet is much reduced and simplified. , , , , , , , , , , , and are not part of the alphabet, but remain in use for proper names and place names. remains a separate letter, to which the digraphs and have been included. and are considered letters, but restricted to represent and , respectively, and thus eliminating the need for the acute or circumflex. replaces in the modern alphabet for ease of input and rendering on English typesets and is also considered a distinct letter. is retained but restricted to represent whilst the digraph is used as a separate letter for . The only letter with two sounds is , which represents in word-final positions and elsewhere before a vowel for etymological purposes.

===Writing samples===
Many of the translations in the Massachusett language were of a religious nature, as the missionaries were hoping to win over converts by using the &#x27;Indian language.&#x27; The following is an example of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer as found in Eliot&#x27;s 1661 publishing of the New Testament in Matthew 6:9:
&#x27;Our Father, who art in Heaven,&#x27;

&#x27;Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

&#x27;Give us this day our daily bread,&#x27;

&#x27;and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,&#x27;

&#x27;and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.&#x27;

&#x27;For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.&#x27;

An excerpt from Josiah Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Vocabulary of the Massachusetts (or Natick) Indian Language&quot;, where the English is his own writings, and the Massachusett that of his father, John Cotton, a prominent preacher to the Wampanoag:

Q: 
&#x27;How shall I learn Indian?&#x27;
A: 
&#x27;By talking with the Indians, and minding their words, and manner of pronouncing.&#x27;

Q: 
&#x27;And what is the difference between the language of the Island [Martha&#x27;s Vineyard], and the main?&#x27;
A: 
&#x27;I can&#x27;t tell or don&#x27;t know, only this I know, that these Indians don&#x27;t understand every word of them Indians.&#x27;

An example of records from the Praying Town of Natick, written in 1700 by Thomas Waban, a descendant of Waban:
&#x27;July 8. Thomas Waban Senior requested on behalf of his&#x27;

&#x27;son, Thomas Waban Junior, and he&#x27;

&#x27;has two acres of meadow.&#x27;

&#x27;The same day John Wamsquon requested on behalf of&#x27;

&#x27;Thomas Wamsquon, and he may have a meadow, and&#x27;

&#x27;he has it. On the same Isaak&#x27;

&#x27;Wuttasukoopauin requested, that day, and he may have&#x27;

&#x27;two acres at Wohquomppagok.&#x27;

&#x27;Kuttahkemmeth. The time was 1686, 10th month, 3d day.&#x27;

==Vocabulary==
Massachusett shares most of its vocabulary with other Algonquian languages. The following table, mostly taken from D. J. Costa&#x27;s description of the SNEA languages, demonstrates the relationship of Massachusett with other languages, such as closely related Eastern Algonquian languages such as the Loup and Narragansett—both also SNEA languages—Penobscot, a representative of the Eastern branch of Abenakian languages, Munsee, a Lenape language, and more distant relatives, such as Arapaho, a Plains Algonquian language and Ojibwe, a Central Algonquian language.


===English influences in the Massachusett language===
With the arrival of the English colonists, the Native Americans quickly began to adopt English in order to communicate and participate in wider society by necessity as the English settlers came to surround and outnumber the natives. The Native Americans adopted the new crops—, , , ; animal husbandry and domesticated animals—, , , ; tools and farming methods and material culture— (&#x27;chamber&#x27;), (&#x27;pewter&#x27;), (&#x27;petticoat&#x27;), (&#x27;calico&#x27; garments), etc. As the Native Americans began to lose their autonomy and were settled into the Praying towns, adopting Christianity—, , , ; colonial laws and courts—, , , , ; naming customs—, ; and eventually adopted the English system of measurements—, (acres); calendar systems—, , , ; and self-government— (&#x27;juryman&#x27;), (&#x27;tithe collector&#x27;), (&#x27;selectman&#x27;), (&#x27;constable&#x27;) and economics—, , (&#x27;money&#x27;), , etc. In addition, many words were introduced by the missionaries unable to find or unaware of a suitable Massachusett translation, thus introducing the proper people and place names of the Bible and various concepts, many of which were later adopted by the Native Americans— (&#x27;Pharoah&#x27;s horsmen&#x27;), (&#x27;shepherd&#x27;), , , , , , , etc.

A number of words were borrowed in their English plural form, used in their singular, and pluralized to however the Native Americans assumed whether the term in question was animate or inanimate. For example, (&#x27;oxen&#x27;), (&#x27;pigs&#x27;) and (&#x27;cows&#x27;) represented the singular &#x27;ox,&#x27; &#x27;pig&#x27; and &#x27;cow&#x27; and but were rendered in the plural as (&#x27;oxen&quot;ak&quot;″), (&#x27;pigs&quot;ack&quot;&#x27;) and (&#x27;cows&quot;ak&quot;″) for &#x27;oxen,&#x27; &#x27;pigs&#x27; and &#x27;cows.&#x27; Mass nouns were also often adopted this way and appear in the plural, for example (&#x27;barley&quot;ash&quot;″), (&#x27;money&quot;ash&quot;″) and (&#x27;shot&quot;ash&quot;″) for &#x27;barley,&#x27; &#x27;money&#x27; and &#x27;shot&#x27; (fired). Most nouns encountered in their plural were realized this way. Other loans, most of which would probably been more commonly heard in the singular were also thus adopted, giving (&#x27;salt&#x27;), (&#x27;Indian&#x27;) and (&#x27;plantation&#x27;).

Due to the complex consonant and vowel inventory of English in comparison to Massachusett, English loan words were pronounced in one of two ways. Those who were more proficient and bilingual in English likely pronounced them closer to English pronunciation with most speakers adapting it to local Massachusett phonology. This can be seen in US English, with more educated speakers or those with some French-language familiarity pronouncing the loan word &quot;guillotine&quot; as either anglicized or in approximation of French ). This may explain the Massachusett doublet and for &#x27;Frenchmen.&#x27; This can be seen in writing, where many loans were spelled in Massachusett, either roughly the same as in English or indicating adaptation. As and do not occur in the language, they were replaced with , for example in and for &#x27;blanket&#x27; and &#x27;share&#x27; or omitted altogether in , &#x27;cider,&#x27; and for &#x27;constable.&#x27;

English loan words were modified with the complex Algonquian noun declension and verb conjugation system, for example, (), &#x27;her/his mark,&#x27; (&#x27;bounds&quot;uw&quot;″), &#x27;it is the bounds,&#x27; (&#x27;nucourtumun&#x27;), &#x27;we (exclusive) [held] court,&#x27; and (&#x27;nuquitclaim[w]un&#x27;), &#x27;I quitclaim it.&#x27; Some were used as adjectives or modifiers, such as (&#x27;stakesuhtuq) &#x27;wooden stake,&#x27; (&#x27;applesôhq&#x27;) &#x27;appletree,&#x27; &#x27;Indian assembly.&#x27;

Despite the relative influence of English, especially in the latter stages when the number of native speakers was quite few, written documents often showed little English vocabulary. This was in part because of the agglutinative native of the language, as new words could be easily formed to express new concepts, as well as possibly a linguistic statement. Many loans were in opposition with native vocabulary, although sometimes one or the other seems to have specialized uses. For example, although &quot;Friday&quot; and &quot;day&quot; were used in Massachusett, when not referring to formal dates, in deeds and legal documents, speakers could also use () and () in general usage. Similar specialization occurred with () which meant &#x27;god&#x27; or &#x27;spirit&#x27; and was later replaced by &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Jehovah&quot; . The importance of the English language to seek employment, communicate with neighboring English settlers and participate in the affairs outside dwindling Native American communities and growing rates of intermarriage in the nineteenth century led speakers to switch to Massachusett Pidgin English, but through a process similar to decreolization, speakers eventually assimilated into the locally prominent speech of Eastern New England English dialects.

===Massachusett influences in the English language===
After the failed settlement of Roanoke (1585) and the first permanent settlement at Jamestown (1607)—near speakers of Powhatan languages—shifted to New England with failed attempts at Cuttyhunk (1602) and Cape Ann (1624) and successful settlement of Plymouth (1621), Salem (1628), Massachusetts Bay (1629)—all in what is now Massachusetts and in the midst of Massachusett-speaking peoples—and a few other sites in New England. The earliest settlers struggled in the colder climate of New England, with their lives dependent on the Native American peoples for education on local agriculture, food aid, protection from less welcoming tribes and a market for trade. Through these close interactions, the English settlers adopted hundreds of words, probably hundreds more when compounds and calques of Massachusett phrases are included. The Algonquian loan words were known as &#x27;wigwam words&#x27; with &quot;wigwam&quot; coming from Massachusett Pidgin for &#x27;house&#x27; or &#x27;home.&#x27;

 Many of the common words such as &quot;papoose&quot; (which originally referred to the Native American children), &quot;squash&quot; and &quot;moccasin&quot; were popularized in 1643, even back in England, with the publication of Roger Williams&#x27; &quot;A Key into the Language of America&quot; and as a result, are often given a Narragansett etymology. Most words were likely borrowed independently until a common form won out, or re-enforced each other through similarity. For example, New Englanders used &quot;wauregan&quot; to mean &#x27;handsome&#x27; and &#x27;showy&#x27; until the end of the nineteenth century from an SNEA R-dialect, most likely from Quiripi , but the first settlers in Massachusetts were already familiar with the older cognate form &quot;wunnegin&quot; from Massachusett () from N-dialect Massachusett. Furthermore, the English settlers of the failed Popham Colony, and later settlements in what is now Maine and New Hampshire encountered from Eastern Abenakian, whilst settlers in the rest of New England encountered from the SNEA languages, ultimately coalescing into English &quot;moose&quot;. Other forms were shortened beyond recognition, with &quot;squash&quot; a shortened slang form of original borrowings &quot;isquontersquash&quot; or &quot;squantersquash&quot; from Massachusett () or Narragansett . Many of these &#x27;Narragansett&#x27; terms were already known to the English settlers of Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth, with William Wood recording &#x27; and &#x27; from Pawtucket speakers of Massachusett and published in his 1634 &quot;New Englands Prospect&quot; nine years before Williams&#x27; &#x27; and &#x27;.
With westward expansion, many of the &#x27;wigwam words&#x27; from New England and even the &#x27;backward&#x27; grammar and syntax of Massachusett Pidgin English were carried westward by the descendants of the early colonists in communication with Native peoples, with the innocent meaning of these words changing to pejoratives or stereotypical language by the late eighteenth century as westward expansion and the pursuit of Manifest Destiny ultimately became a protracted genocide of mass killings and biological warfare. As the newly subjugated peoples of the frontier were often not Algonquian speakers and unfamiliar with these terms, they nevertheless resented the specific vocabulary used against them. Most notable is &quot;squaw&quot;, borrowed from Massachusett () and which simply meant &#x27;female&#x27; in general. However, as it was used only as an insult, with connotations of the submissive, obedient Native American wife, the outspoken old Native woman or the exotic temptress of the wilderness, and folk etymologies have been assigned that many contemporary people believe, such as the origin of the word from an old Iroquoian phrase for female genitals.

Tribal groups, Native advocacy groups and social pressure has led to name changes of several species and place names, but &quot;squaw&quot; remains a common element in these domains. Similarly, many of the Algonquian loan words such as &quot;firewater&quot;, &quot;bury the hatchet&quot;, &quot;wampum&quot;, &quot;papoose&quot;, &quot;powwow&quot; and &quot;brave&quot; can be used to construct offensively, stereotypical sentences, especially when used in Native-specific contexts; they were long used in the condescending, paternalistic writings of explorers, government anthropologists and agency reports and nineteenth century literature referencing the &#x27;last&#x27; of the &#x27;noble savages,&#x27; such as James Fenmoore Cooper&#x27;s 1826 &quot;Last of the Mohegans&quot; which re-introduced many of the fading terms of the colonial period. Use of the wigwam words in these disparaging contexts were cited as one of the primary reasons for high drop-out rates of Native American high school students, often served by European-American teachers.

The coastal dialects of Eastern New England English absorbed many more of these words due to longer interaction and the fact that they are spoken over the territory of Massachusett and related languages. The majority of Algonquian loan words fell into obscurity by the end of the nineteenth century, coinciding locally with the death of the last speakers of Massachusett as well as nationally with the complete subjugation of all of North America&#x27;s indigenous peoples and policies, largely successful, implemented to eradicate Native American political units, languages and culture. Most of the local dialectal words suffered the same fate, but a legacy of it survives in the use of &quot;quahog&quot; and &quot;chogset&quot; to refer to the &#x27;hard-shelled clam&#x27; or &#x27;round clam&#x27; &quot;Mercenaria mercenaria&quot; and an edible wrasse fish, &quot;Tautoga onitis&quot;, known elsewhere as &quot;black porgy&quot;, &quot;chub&quot;, &quot;blackfish&quot; or &quot;oyster-fish&quot;. The dwindled vocabulary, only fifty or so terms from New England are still current and most only locally are nevertheless important for two reasons. Firstly, they represent the second oldest and largest corpus of Algonquian loan words after Powhatan, and are among the first true &#x27;Americanisms&#x27; that began to differentiate American English. Secondly, the Massachusett loan words resisted replacement to lexical borrowings from other indigenous languages. Although American English has since adopted &#x27;tipi,&#x27; &#x27;hogan&#x27; and &#x27;quiggly hole&#x27; to refer to quite different housing structures, in the early part of the nineteenth century, referring to them all as &quot;wigwams&quot; was commonplace as it was already adopted as the general word for a Native American dwelling. Similarly, &quot;moose&quot; was not replaced by Lakota , Navajo nor Haida , but in fact replaced Lower Chinook with the corresponding Chinook Jargon word from Massachusett, via English, having replaced the original term.

Most of the &#x27;wigwam words,&#x27; including &quot;wigwam&quot;, were not borrowed directly from Massachusett but instead were drawn from Massachusett Pidgin. Simpler in grammar, it also incorporated archaic word forms and forms from neighboring languages understood over a broader region. For instance, the English settlers used &quot;sachem&quot; and &quot;sagamore&quot; somewhat interchangeably to refer to tribal leaders or &#x27;chiefs.&#x27; &quot;Sachem&quot; is likely from Massachusett or () whereas &quot;sagamore&quot;, from Massachusett Pidgin (*), either an archaic construction or from Eastern Abenakian , but all descend from Proto-Algonquian . Similarly, the English settlers adopted &quot;meechum&quot; for &#x27;food&#x27; and &quot;wigwam&quot; for &#x27;house&#x27; from Pidgin () and (), with the proper Massachusett terms being () and (), &#x27;her/his house,&#x27; or (), &#x27;house&#x27; (in general), respectively, with all forms descendants of Proto-Algonquian .

===Topographical legacy===
Numerous streets, ponds, lakes, hills, and villages across eastern Massachusetts have Massachusett-language origins. The name of the state itself may mean &#x27;near the big hill&#x27; or &#x27;hill shaped like an arrowhead&#x27;. Very few cities and towns have Massachusett names, most ultimately linked to towns and villages in England, but the ones that probably have a Massachusett origin include Acushnet (&#x27;calm water resting place&#x27;), Aquinnah (&#x27;under the hills&#x27;). Cohasset (, &#x27;long fishing point&#x27;), Mashpee (, &#x27;great water&#x27;), Nantucket, &#x27;in the midst of the waters&#x27;, Natick, &#x27;place of hills&#x27;, Saugus (&#x27;the outlet, the extension&#x27;), Scituate, &#x27;cold brook&#x27;, Seekonk, &#x27;Canada goose&#x27;, and Swampscott, &#x27;at the red rock&#x27; or &#x27;broken waters&#x27;. Other notable Indian placenames include &quot;Shawmut&quot; (, former name for Boston, &#x27;canoe landing place&#x27;), &quot;Neponset&quot; (a river that flows through the Dorchester section of Boston and a village of Dorchester, meaning unknown), Cuttyhunk Island (, &#x27;a point of departure&#x27;), Nantasket (a beach in Hull, &#x27;a low-ebb tide place&#x27;), and Mystic River (&#x27;great river&#x27;).

<text>The Seasons (German: Die Jahreszeiten, Hob. XXI:3) is a secular oratorio by Joseph Haydn, first performed in 1801.

==History==
Haydn was led to write &quot;The Seasons&quot; by the great success of his previous oratorio &quot;The Creation&quot; (1798), which had become very popular and was in the course of being performed all over Europe.

===Libretto=== 
The libretto for &quot;The Seasons&quot; was prepared for Haydn, just as with &quot;The Creation&quot;, by Baron Gottfried van Swieten, an Austrian nobleman who had also exercised an important influence on the career of Mozart (among other things commissioning Mozart&#x27;s reorchestration of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;). Van Swieten&#x27;s libretto was based on extracts from the long English poem &quot;The Seasons&quot; by James Thomson (1700–1748), which had been published in 1730.

Whereas in &quot;The Creation&quot; Swieten was able to limit himself to rendering an existing (anonymous) libretto into German, for &quot;The Seasons&quot; he had a much more demanding task. Olleson writes, &quot;Even when Thomson&#x27;s images were retained, they required abbreviation and adaptation to such an extent that usually no more than faint echoes of them can be discerned, and the libretto often loses all touch with the poem which was its starting point. Increasingly during the course of the oratorio, the words are essentially van Swieten&#x27;s own or even imported from foreign sources.&quot;

Like &quot;The Creation&quot;, &quot;The Seasons&quot; was intended as a bilingual work. Since Haydn was very popular in England (particularly following his visits there in 1791–1792 and 1794–1795), he wished the work to be performable in English as well as German. Van Swieten therefore made a translation of his libretto back into English, fitting it to the rhythm of the music. Olleson notes that it is &quot;fairly rare&quot; that the translated version actually matches the Thomson original. Van Swieten&#x27;s command of English was not perfect, and the English text he created has not always proven satisfying to listeners; for example, one critic writes, &quot;Clinging to [the] retranslation, however, is the heavy-handed imagery of Haydn&#x27;s sincere, if officious, patron. Gone is the bloom of Thomson&#x27;s original.&quot; Olleson calls the English text &quot;often grotesque&quot;, and suggests that English-speaking choruses should perform the work in German: &quot;&quot;The Seasons&quot; is better served by the decent obscurity of a foreign language than by the English of the first version.&quot; Van Swieten&#x27;s words also show some inconsistency in tone, ranging from the rustically humorous (for instance, a movement depicting a wily peasant girl playing a trick on her rich suitor) to the uplifting (as in several large-scale choruses praising God for the beauty of nature).

===Composition, premiere, and publication===
The composition process was arduous for Haydn, in part because his health was gradually failing and partly because Haydn found van Swieten&#x27;s libretto to be rather taxing. Haydn took two years to complete the work.

Like &quot;The Creation&quot;, &quot;The Seasons&quot; had a dual premiere, first for the aristocracy whose members had financed the work (Schwarzenberg palace, Vienna, 24 April 1801), then for the public (Redoutensaal, Vienna, 19 May). The oratorio was considered a clear success, but not a success comparable to that of &quot;The Creation&quot;. In the years that followed, Haydn continued to lead oratorio performances for charitable causes, but it was usually &quot;The Creation&quot; that he led, not &quot;The Seasons&quot;.

The aging Haydn lacked the energy needed to repeat the labor of self-publication that he had undertaken for &quot;The Creation&quot; and instead assigned the new oratorio to his regular publisher at that time, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, who published it in 1802.

==Forces==
&quot;The Seasons&quot; is written for a fairly large late-Classical orchestra, a chorus singing mostly in four parts, and three vocal soloists, representing archetypal country folk: Simon (bass), Lucas (tenor), and Hanne (soprano). The solo voices are thus the same three as in &quot;The Creation&quot;.

The orchestral parts are for 2 flutes (1st doubling on piccolo in one aria), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons and contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 1 alto trombone, 1 tenor trombone and 1 bass trombone, timpani, percussion (triangle, bass drum, cymbals) and strings (violins, violas, cellos, basses).

However, some of the key early performances at the Tonkünstler Society in Vienna were for much larger forces (as was the fashion at the time); Haydn led performances for both large and small ensembles. Material surviving from these large-scale Viennese performances indicates the use of tripled wind (arranged into three separate groups, each one similar to the &quot;Harmonie&quot; wind ensembles of the time), doubled brass and as many as ten horn players, backed up by at least eighty string players and similar numbers of singers.

In addition, a fortepiano usually plays in secco recitatives, with or without other instruments from the orchestra.

==Musical content==
The oratorio is divided into four parts, corresponding to Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, with the usual recitatives, arias, choruses, and ensemble numbers.

Among the more rousing choruses are a hunting song with horn calls, a wine celebration with dancing peasants (foreshadowing the third movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Pastoral Symphony), a loud thunderstorm (ditto for Beethoven&#x27;s fourth movement), and an absurdly stirring ode to toil:

:&quot;The huts that shelter us,&quot;
:&quot;The wool that covers us,&quot;
:&quot;The food that nourishes us,&quot;
:&quot;All is thy grant, thy gift,&quot;
:&quot;O noble toil.&quot;

Haydn remarked that while he had been industrious his whole life, this was the first occasion he had ever been asked to write a chorus in praise of industry.

Some especially lyrical passages are the choral prayer for a bountiful harvest, &quot;Sei nun gnädig, milder Himmel&quot; (Be thou gracious, O kind heaven), the gentle nightfall that follows the storm, and Hanne&#x27;s cavatina on Winter.

The work is filled with the &quot;tone-painting&quot; that also characterized &quot;The Creation&quot;: a plowman whistles as he works (in fact, he whistles the well-known theme from Haydn&#x27;s own Surprise Symphony), a bird shot by a hunter falls from the sky, there is a sunrise (evoking the one in &quot;The Creation&quot;), and so on.

==The &quot;French trash&quot; episode==

There is some evidence that Haydn himself was not happy with van Swieten&#x27;s libretto, or at least one particular aspect of tone-painting it required, namely the portrayal of the croaking of frogs, which is found during the serene movement that concludes Part II, &quot;Summer&quot;. The version of the anecdote given below is from the work of Haydn scholar H. C. Robbins Landon.

In 1801, August Eberhard Müller (1767–1817) prepared a piano version of the oratorio&#x27;s orchestra part, for purposes of rehearsal and informal performance. Haydn, whose health was in decline, did not take on this task himself, but he did look over a draft of Müller&#x27;s work and wrote some suggested changes in the margins. Amid these changes appeared an off-the-cuff complaint about van Swieten&#x27;s libretto:

:&quot;NB! This whole passage, with its imitation of the frogs, was not my idea: I was forced to write this Frenchified trash. This wretched idea disappears rather soon when the whole orchestra is playing, but it simply cannot be included in the pianoforte reduction.&quot;

Robbins Landon continues the story as follows:

: Müller foolishly showed the passage in the enclosed sheet, quoted above, to the editor of the &quot;Zeitung für die elegante Welt&quot;, who promptly included it in support of his criticism of Swieten&#x27;s wretched libretto. Swieten was enraged, and [Haydn&#x27;s friend] Griesinger reported that His Excellency &quot;intends to rub into Haydn&#x27;s skin, with salt and pepper, the assertion that he [Haydn] was forced into composing the croaking frogs.&quot;

A later letter of Griesinger&#x27;s indicates that the rift thus created was not permanent.

The term &quot;Frenchified trash&quot; was almost certainly not a gesture of contempt for France or French people; Haydn in fact had friendly relationships with French musicians (see, e.g. Paris symphonies). Rather, Haydn was probably referring to an earlier attempt by van Swieten to persuade him to set the croaking of the frogs by showing him a work by the French composer André Grétry that likewise included frog-croaking.

==Critical reception==

Although the work has always attracted far less attention than &quot;The Creation&quot;, it nonetheless has been strongly appreciated by critics. Charles Rosen calls both oratorios &quot;among the greatest works of the century&quot;, but judges &quot;The Seasons&quot; to be the musically more successful of the two. Daniel Heartz, writing near the end of a massive three-volume account of the Classical era, writes &quot;The Hunting and Drinking choruses first led me to study Haydn&#x27;s music more extensively beginning some forty years ago ... no music has elated me more in old age than &quot;The Seasons&quot;.&quot; Michael Steinberg writes that the work &quot;ensure[s] Haydn&#x27;s premiere place with Titian, Michelangelo and Turner, Mann and Goethe, Verdi and Stravinsky, as one of the rare artists to whom old age brings the gift of ever bolder invention.&quot; 

Opinions vary as to the nature of the relationship between &quot;The Creation&quot; and &quot;The Seasons&quot; – whether they are two separate works or an enormous religious diptych. Van Swieten, at any rate, was certainly keen to follow up on the former&#x27;s success with another large-scale pictorial work in a similar vein, and some authors have seen the two oratorios as constituting the first and second act of a metaphorical &#x27;vast sacred opera&#x27;.

<text>The Letter People is a children&#x27;s literacy program. The term also refers to the family of various characters depicted in it.

==Original program==

Elayne Reiss-Weimann and Rita Friedman, two teachers from George Miller Elementary in Nanuet, New York, created the concept of Letter People. In 1964, first-grade teacher Reiss-Weimann formed the original idea for the Letter People. She had struggled daily to draw the attention of her 24 students (who were typical first-graders, eager and rambunctious) in a distraction-fond hallway classroom at the overcrowded school. Weimann collaborated with an early childhood coordinator, Rita Friedman, to create an educational program that revolved around 26 anthropomorphic characters, each representing a letter of the alphabet, to teach beginning readers how to &quot;decode&quot; or &quot;sound out&quot; the consonants and vowels that form words. They embodied the basic rules of phonics into stories about this clan of make-believe pictograms called the Letter People.

Each letter of the alphabet had a distinct characteristic to help children learn not only the letter but the sound the letter represents in the written word. For example, Mister M has a munching mouth, Mister N has a noisy nose and Mister T has tall teeth. The characters were painted on large, two-dimensional portrait cards. Each character was given an engaging personality to help the teacher bring her or him alive in the classroom, and each character had a song (or a poem at the time) to help children recall the distinguishing feature and sound. With the help of the Letter People, children remained on-task, learned more quickly, and retained what they learned. From the beginning, the children viewed the Letter People like real people and not just letters of the alphabet, phonics devices, or toys. On one occasion, when the Letter People had to be shipped to another school, the children insisted that holes would be placed in the boxes so that the Letter People could breathe as they traveled.

Weimann and Friedman later sold the idea to New Dimensions in Education, Inc. (based in Plainview, New York, and later in Norwalk, Connecticut) which, in turn, copyrighted and published The Letter People educational products in 1968. Liz Callen was hired by NDE to design the looks of the characters. NDE developed the concept into classroom programs: &quot;Alpha One&quot; in 1968, and &quot;Alpha Time&quot; in 1972.

Both program&#x27;s basic concept was simple: Each letter of the English alphabet was represented by a unique character with traits derived from itself. The consonants were males (as the Letter Boys) and the vowels were females (as the Letter Girls, whom there could be no word without). Reiss-Weimann and Friedman also wrote two series of books about the characters, &quot;Read-to-Me&quot; (1972–1978) and &quot;Fables from the Letter People&quot; (1988–1989). Callen returned to illustrate all the books of the latter series. Each Letter Person also had an accompanying song (available on cassettes and vinyl record), and inflatable vinyl effigies in two sizes or a.k.a. &quot;life-size&quot;) known as &quot;Huggables&quot;. Other merchandise included filmstrips, flash cards, giant picture cards, board games, puzzles, other educational vinyl records, and coloring sheets. Educators who adopted the program were trained in its implementation, and &quot;The Letter People&quot; was soon picked up by over 37,000 schools across the US.

=== Alpha One ===
&quot;Alpha One,&quot; also known as &quot;Alpha One: Breaking the Code&quot;, was a first and second grade program introduced in 1968, and revised in 1974, that was designed to teach children to read and write sentences containing words containing three syllables in length and to develop within the child a sense of his own success and fun in learning to read by using the Letter People characters. Alpha One&#x27;s game-like approach capitalized upon the child&#x27;s sense of fun and imagination to develop interest in learning to read and spell. Learning letter symbols and sounds, mastering rules of word formation, and reading and writing are byproducts of the interaction between the child and his 26 &quot;Letter People&quot; friends, his participation in creative and dramatic play, his enjoyment of activities associated with specially developed filmstrips and recorded stories and rhymes, and his programmed success in a variety of visual and auditory discrimination &quot;Letter People&quot; games. This program is the precursor to the Alpha Time program.

==== Contents of the Alpha One Kit ====
Nearly all of the following materials have been described in conjunction with explaining the games and activities used during Alpha One lessons. In addition, teachers could also buy more materials through the NDE catalog along with the base program. The contents of the base Alpha One Kit are listed below with little additional explanation:

* Letter People and Symbol Cards: 26 sturdy placards (14” x 16”) each displaying a large cartoon of a Letter Person; 4 Symbol Charts to help decode words.
* Story Pictures and Easel: 26 scenes illustrated on 19&quot; x 24” placards; the easel is designed to hole&#x27; both Story Pictures and Letter People.
* Letter Meeting Greeting Packets and Alphabet Sheets: Each packet contains a pad of 35 Greeting Cards for each of the 26 letters.
* Chatterbooks: 35 individual activity books for decoding, reading, and spelling words.
* Puppets and Stage: Scripts, in verse, are also provided.
* Chalkboards: 35 individual reusable slates to be used for decoding and spelling.
* Chatter Album: 12”, 33 1/3 rpm record which reinforces the learning of the vowel &quot;sounds and some of the basic lessons in the program.
* Filmstrips: Humorous episodes that reinforce identification of letters with personified characteristics.
* Duplicating Masters: 50 tests to aid the teacher in evaluating student work, and assignments children take home to demonstrate progress to their parents.
* Professional Guide: A detailed step— by— step lesson plan for each learning unit.
* Alpha Wagon: A container which houses the above materials mounted on wheels for portability.

=== Alpha Time ===
&quot;Alpha Time,&quot; also known as &quot;Alpha Time: Beginning Reading,&quot; was a kindergarten program introduced in 1972, and revised in 1976 and 1980 that was meant to help children develop oral communication; dramatic play; oral/aural discrimination; visual discrimination and letter identification; and social living through the use of the Letter People. In &quot;Alpha Time&quot;, kindergarteners were introduced to the child-sized vinyl characters commonly known as the Huggables&quot;, which were large enough for small children to hug (though there were smaller-sized Huggables as well), instead of the 2D picture cards used in the 1st and 2nd grade Alpha One program. Alpha Time was meant to be used before Alpha One to introduce children to basic concepts.

==== Contents of the Alpha Time Kit ====

* 144 Picture Squares: These pictures belong to the Letter People whose sound is heard in the picture word. Activities involving these Picture Squares include the following skills: auditory discrimination, associating words with pictures, sorting, matching, classifying, counting, visual memory.
* 5 12&quot; RPM Disc Recordings
* 27 Puzzles: These puzzles have interlocking pieces graduated from simple to advanced muscular coordination. The puzzles are a means of individually reinforcing the association of the Letter Person with his characteristic, (sound symbol), his letter, and a word that begins with his sound.
* 162 Duplicating Masters: These whimsically illustrated activity sheets serve as -reinforcement and evaluation of each day&#x27;s learning: experience -which the children may take home. Each has a-note for the parent, &#x27;thus serving as a liaison between school and home. Included are letters to parents describing the Alpha Time process.
* 6 Filmstrips: These colorful films may be used as a medium for group or individual activities to review the stories they depict, or as a basis for discussing color, shape, number, comparative sizes and location.
* Four &quot;Read to Me&quot; books: These are entertaining, vividly illustrated stories about four of the Letter People, which the teacher reads to the children, or which may be looked at while listening to the &quot;read along&quot; recording of the story. 
* 420 Picture Books (70 copies each of six different books): The topic of each of these eight page picture readers is exclusively drawn from the children&#x27;s classroom experiences. No matter what a child&#x27;s background, he can share in the comprehension of the Story as it unfolds.
* The Huggables (26 inflatable Letter People): Inflatable vinyl effigies in two sizes or .
* 16 Giant Picture Cards: These cards depict familiar scenes in a child&#x27;s life, or illustrate a story that has been told in class. It is the first step in picture reading. It draws on the child&#x27;s personal experience for discussion and serves as a basis for role playing. (oral communication, identification from context clues, numeration, extracting the main idea).
* 2 Board Games: These colorful games are designed to be used in simple as well as more advanced activities. As more Letter People are introduced in the lesson the activities become more challenging. Skills which are reinforced in these games include: matching, sorting, classifying, relating picture to sound, visual, oral, aural sound discriminating, following directions, counting, visual memory.
* 4 Decks of Playing Cards: Used alongside the 2 board games.
* 1 Professional Guide: The guide has an easy to follow step by step lesson plan for each day. It may be adapted for use with small or large groups. Each lesson has an &quot;On Their Own&quot; section which is a suggested list of activities related to the content of the lesson. &quot;On Their Own&quot; gives children the opportunity to choose individual activities for enrichment or reinforcement.

==Television series==

Alan J. Pratt, Ph.D., a director and vice-president of NDE, Inc. approached KETC-TV, a PBS affiliate in St. Louis, Missouri, about creating a TV series based on the escapades of the Letter People. After five pilot programs were produced, Dr. Pratt approached the Council of Great City Schools (the 20 largest school districts in the US). Eventually, with the cooperation of the superintendents of the Council, NDE, and KETC-TV, a joint venture commenced. The series comprised sixty 15-minute episodes that became extremely popular nationwide with children who were learning to read. To ensure phonetic and linguistic accuracy in the television production process, Ruth Lerner from NDE served as the Editorial Supervisor. Pratt was the Curriculum Consultant for the TV series. Tom McDonough of KETC-TV was the series&#x27; writer-director. While thousands of children were learning about the Letter People in school, thousands of others were being exposed to them through the television series based on the program. The show was extremely popular with children, and it quickly spread to over 105 other television stations across the country, via syndication, mainly to PBS and educational stations. The television series premiered on March 13, 1974.

&quot;The Letter People&quot; (relatively primitive puppets) undertake various adventures in Letter People Land, a dark, featureless place populated by strange people and creatures. Episodes usually focus on introducing new Letter People or new sounds formed by combining two Letter People together (such as /CH/ or /OU/). Other episodes take the Letter People to more exotic (though still featureless) locales such as outer space (eventually, the show would include more standard scenery, like cityscapes, meadows, Miss O&#x27;s opera house, etc.), while a few highlight the characters&#x27; conflicts over various sounds (such as Mister C fighting Mister K for his sound). Another common feature of the show is the Catching Game, which is a game show hosted by Monty Swell (who is a character based on Monty Hall) where the Letter People must form words by positioning themselves correctly side-by-side.

=== Opening and closing sequence ===
A little dog is minding his own business when various figures (including a female figure carrying a bunch of helium balloons) enter the gates of &quot;Letter People Land&quot; as the song plays:

:&quot; Come and meet the Letter People&quot;
:&quot; Come and visit the family&quot;
:&quot; Words are made of Letter People&quot;
:&quot; A, B, C, D, follow me&quot;

===Episode guide===
===Availability===
The show continued to air reruns on PBS stations until the Letter People program was revised in late 1996. It is rumored that PBS was ordered to destroy the show&#x27;s master tapes on behalf of the newer program, given that the original program&#x27;s characters depicted negative imagery. Prior to this, NDE released the show&#x27;s episodes on a 5-tape VHS set of Letter People &quot;Learning Advantage Videos&quot; as part of the Letter People curriculum in the early-to-mid 1990s; on the other hand, fans have preserved the episodes on many VHS recordings taped off of TV while the show was still on the air, and various DVDs having the episodes preserved can be found from time to time on auction sites such as eBay.

==Revised==

In 1990, Abrams &amp; Co. Publishers Inc. (founded in 1989) of Austin, Texas, bought the rights to &quot;The Letter People&quot; from the previous owner, Norwalk, Connecticut-based [[New Dimensions in Education, Inc.] At first, the company slightly revised the program, such as adding [[lowercase]] letters to the back of each Letter Person (previously they had been placed on each character somewhat randomly), but in 1996, they gave the program a major update, completely redesigning the look of the characters (however, some Letter People keep half of their designs from their original counterparts) and the associated materials, and also made sweeping changes to many of the Letter People, especially over half of their genders themselves, most obviously equalizing the proportion of male to female characters (vowels are now distinguished by their ability to light up via &quot;LetterLights&quot;, which appear as yellow suns on their right shoulders). The male characters&#x27; names changed from &quot;Mister&quot; to &quot;Mr.&quot;, and the female characters&#x27; names changed from &quot;Miss&quot; to &quot;Ms.&quot;. Most of the characters&#x27; associated characteristics were changed as well, such as all references to &quot;[[junk food]]&quot; being swapped for non-food-related characteristics (Mr. D&#x27;s &quot;delicious donuts&quot; were exchanged for &quot;dazzling dance&quot;, for example) and any Letter Person that Abrams deemed as expressing negative images being changed to be more positive (Mr. H&#x27;s horrible hair became happy hair instead, Mr. R&#x27;s Ripping Rubberbands became Rainbow Ribbons, and Mr. X was no longer all wrong and became different, albeit still mixed-up). Alphakid A was used as the newer program&#x27;s mascot.

New Letter People storybooks were written, many with simple rebus and decodable words. In 2002, a newer &quot;Read-to-Me&quot; book series was also written, with an eye toward teaching [[conflict resolution]] and [[problem-solving]] skills, and features a variety of genres including storybook, mystery, biography, poetry, and nonfiction.

The program is divided into three levels with increasing emphasis on [[phonics]]: &quot;Let&#x27;s Begin with the Letter People&quot; for [[preschool]], &quot;Land of the Letter People&quot; for [[kindergarten]], and &quot;Lives of the Letter People&quot; for [[first grade]]. The program has been taught to about 35 million children.

Though the program is generally well received by educators, some have criticized its strong focus on phonics at the expense of other literacy-building techniques.

In 2008, after Abrams &amp; Co. Publishers, Inc. was acquired by Learning Trends and merged into Abrams Learning Trends, The Letter People program, along with other Abrams &amp; Co. Publishers properties, eventually became incorporated into the DIG Pre-K curriculum.

In the early 2010s, four new Letter People characters were added to the program in order to teach children Spanish. The four characters are &quot;Srta. Ch&quot;, &quot;Sr. Ll&quot;, &quot;Srta. Ñ&quot; and &quot;Sr. Rr&quot;.

In May 2019, Abrams Learning Trends, along with its properties including The Letter People characters, was acquired by Excelligence Learning Corporation and became incorporated into a subsidiary of Frog Street Press, thus causing Abrams Learning Trends to cease operations as an individual company. As of September 21, 2020, The Letter People had no more new content made but the franchise continued to be kept alive as a learning unit of the DIG Pre-K program, with the hand puppets, certain educational materials, a CD with the songs, and most of the big books of the Letter People (all only available for purchase as part of the DIG Pre-K program) having been available on Frog Street Enterprises&#x27; online store until early 2024. All discontinued material such as worksheets, flashcards, the Huggables, and other books of the Letter People are still available second-hand from time to time through other online stores such as eBay.

As of February 1, 2024, Frog Street Press discontinued the DIG Pre-K program, ending the life of the Letter People franchise due to low sales.

== The Number Workers ==
Along with the original program of &quot;The Letter People&quot;, its mathematics-equivalent program &quot;The Number Workers&quot; was also created. The Number Workers are referred to as the numerical cousins of the Letter People from a planet called &quot;Number Workers World&quot; and were created to help children learn not only about numbers, their sounds and how many there are in each number, but also symbols, mathematics, time, addition, and measurement. They range from numbers 1–9 with the odd numbers being males (as the Number Boys) and the even numbers being females (as the Number Girls). Each Number Person carries a number of objects to teach children how many there are to represent the number (such as Mister 1 having &quot;only one of everything: a one-legged table, a one-legged chair, one microscope, one test tube and one clock with one hand&quot;), and also represents the job they employ: Mister 1 as a scientist, Miss 2 as a doctor, Mister 3 as a pilot, Miss 4 as a construction worker, Mister 5 as a sports player, Miss 6 as a shape stacker, Mister 7 as an ice-cream salesman, Miss 8 as a photographer and Mister 9 as a magician. ( Note that the Number Workers are called &quot;Number People&quot; even though they are never referred to the Number People in the official program)

Unlike &quot;The Letter People&quot;, &quot;The Number Workers&quot; (and its later revamped version &quot;The Number People&quot;) was lesser-known and had very few products, including an &quot;Alpha Math&quot; workbook (Number World Book), flashcards, giant picture cards, a teacher&#x27;s guide, and a vinyl-containing accompanying songs for each Number Worker.

== The Number People ==
When &quot;The Letter People&quot; program was revamped in 1996, &quot;The Number Workers&quot; program was also revamped along with it and was renamed &quot;The Number People&quot;. This version features six males (Mr. 0, Mr. 2, Mr. 4, Mr. 5, Mr. 9, and Mr. 10) and five females (Miss 1, Miss 3, Miss 6, Miss 7, and Miss 8), with two new numbers introduced, which are 0 and 10. Each Number Person has the numeral placed to the top-right corner of his/her uniform, while a number word was also added to the back of each Number Person. A Spanish-language version was also available to teach the Spanish names of the numbers.

==Place where the Letter People live==

In the original 1968 program, the place where the Letter People live was originally a fictional town called &quot;Letter People Land&quot; but, when the program was revised in 1990, it was renamed the &quot;Land of the Letter People&quot;. As the newly revised program in 1996 utilized the newer version of the characters and town structures, the name of the Letter People&#x27;s residence still remained the same.

==List of Letter People==
* Note: The characteristic of Miss I and Miss O changed shortly before &quot;The Letter People&quot; television series ended its run.
* Note: The characteristic of Mr. Q changed from &quot;Quiet Questions&quot; to just &quot;Questions&quot; to teach children that keeping your questions &quot;quiet&quot; will not answer them.

<doc id="640742" wikidata="Q1477173" url="?curid=640742" title="Kjerag">
<text>Kjerag or Kiragg is a mountain in the Sandnes municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The tall mountain sits on the southern shore of Lysefjorden, just southwest of the village of Lysebotn. Its northern side is a massive cliff, plunging almost straight down to the fjord; a sight which attracts many visitors each year. Another tourist attraction, the Kjeragbolten, is a stone wedged between two rocks is located on the mountain. The Kjeragfossen waterfall plunges off the mountain down to the fjord. It is one of the tallest waterfalls in the world.

Kjerag is a popular hiking destination. Some go there because Preikestolen has become too crowded, some to jump onto Kjeragbolten and some BASE jumpers from all over the world go there to jump off the high cliffs. Kjerag is also a popular climbing destination, with many difficult routes going up its steep faces. The easiest ascent starts from the visitor center Øygardsstølen, with a 2.5-3-hour walk each way. From Stavanger, it is roughly a 2-hour drive (closed in winter season). One can also take the tourist ferry from Lauvvik to Lysebotn in summer. The best season for walking is considered late June to September depending on snow conditions.

==Kjeragbolten==

Kjeragbolten is a boulder wedged in a mountain crevice by the edge of the Kjerag mountain (). It is possible to walk onto the rock without any equipment, but there is a direct drop below and then another gradient down to the Lysefjorden. The name means &quot;Kjerag Boulder&quot; or &quot;Kjerag Bolt&quot;.

==BASE jumping==
Kjerag has become a popular BASE jumping destination. Since 1994, when Stein Edvartsen made the first officially registered jump, until 2016, a total number of jumps have been registered. During this time period 131 accidents have been registered, 44 of which required the use of rescue helicopter, and 10 cases where jumpers were rescued by other professional rescue climbers. According to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation there have been 11 fatal accidents involving BASE jumpers alone. A list of jumpers who perished at Kjerag is provided below:
* Sebastian Dectot (24, from France), August 16, 1996
* Ulla-Stina Östberg (46, from Sweden), July 29, 1997
* Thor Alex Kappfjell (32, from Norway), July 6, 1999
* Kirill Goretov (29, from Russia), August 15, 1999
* Terry Forrestal (52, from the United Kingdom), June 10, 2000
* Valentino Venturi (30, from Italy), August 5, 2000
* Lori Barr (37, from the United States), July 23, 2002
* Rob Tompkins (30, from the United States), September 12, 2002
* Darcy Zoitsas (nickname: &quot;Peter Pan&quot;) (39, from Australia), July 19, 2005
* Anton Knestyapin (25, from Russia), July 25, 2010
* Michael Leming (53, from the United States), June 25, 2016 

In the Norwegian documentary film &quot;Loop&quot;, Kristen Reagan climbs up the drop before BASE jumping off the same cliff.

Rock Climbing
Kjerag was first climbed in the spring of 1985 by Pat Littlejohn, Steve Jones, Dick Renshaw and Lyndsey Foulkes, who abseiled in without sighting the wall from below, and chose their route from photographs in the public domain. Pete Whittaker having performed a roped solo of Free-Rider on El Capitan in autumn 2016, free-soloed the Renshaw-Foulkes climb in summer 2020.

==Name==
The name is possibly a compound of &quot;kje&quot; which means &#x27;kid&#x27; and &quot;ragg&quot; which means &#x27;goat&#x27;s hair, shag&#x27;. The rough surface of the mountainside has been compared with the shaggy hair of a kid goat.

== In popular culture ==
*A movie song called Amali thumali (from 01:33m to 1:35m and from 04:19m to 04:21m ) from the 2011 blockbuster Tamil language movie &quot;Ko (film)&quot; features the lead couples dancing on the top of the boulder at Kjeragbolten.

<doc id="640746" wikidata="Q14915286" url="?curid=640746" title="Secant method">
<text>In numerical analysis, the secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function &quot;f&quot;. The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton&#x27;s method, so it is considered a quasi-Newton method. Historically, it is as an evolution of the method of false position, which predates Newton&#x27;s method by over 3000 years.

==The method==
The secant method is an iterative numerical method for finding a zero of a function . Given two initial values and , the method proceeds according to the recurrence relation
:formula_1

This is a nonlinear second-order recurrence that is well-defined given and the two initial values and . Ideally, the initial values should be chosen close to the desired zero.

==Derivation of the method==
Starting with initial values and , we construct a line through the points and , as shown in the picture above. In slope–intercept form, the equation of this line is

:formula_2
The root of this linear function, that is the value of such that is

:formula_3

We then use this new value of as and repeat the process, using and instead of and . We continue this process, solving for , , etc., until we reach a sufficiently high level of precision (a sufficiently small difference between and ):

:formula_4

==Convergence==

The iterates formula_5 of the secant method converge to a root of formula_6 if the initial values formula_7 and formula_8 are sufficiently close to the root and formula_6 is well-behaved. When formula_6 is twice continuously differentiable and the root in question is a simple root, i.e., it has multiplicity 1, the order of convergence is the golden ratio formula_11 This convergence is superlinear but subquadratic.

If the initial values are not close enough to the root or formula_6 is not well-behaved, then there is no guarantee that the secant method converges at all. There is no general definition of &quot;close enough&quot;, but the criterion for convergence has to do with how &quot;wiggly&quot; the function is on the interval between the initial values. For example, if formula_6 is differentiable on that interval and there is a point where formula_14 on the interval, then the algorithm may not converge.

==Comparison with other root-finding methods==

The secant method does not require or guarantee that the root remains bracketed by sequential iterates, like the bisection method does, and hence it does not always converge. The false position method (or ) uses the same formula as the secant method. However, it does not apply the formula on formula_15 and formula_16, like the secant method, but on formula_15 and on the last iterate formula_18 such that formula_19 and formula_20 have a different sign. This means that the false position method always converges; however, only with a linear order of convergence. Bracketing with a super-linear order of convergence as the secant method can be attained with improvements to the false position method (see Regula falsi § Improvements in &quot;regula falsi&quot;) such as the ITP method or the Illinois method.

The recurrence formula of the secant method can be derived from the formula for Newton&#x27;s method
:formula_21
by using the finite-difference approximation, for a small formula_22:

formula_23

The secant method can be interpreted as a method in which the derivative is replaced by an approximation and is thus a quasi-Newton method.

If we compare Newton&#x27;s method with the secant method, we see that Newton&#x27;s method converges faster (order 2 against order the golden ratio &quot;φ&quot; ≈ 1.6). However, Newton&#x27;s method requires the evaluation of both formula_6 and its derivative formula_25 at every step, while the secant method only requires the evaluation of formula_6. Therefore, the secant method may sometimes be faster in practice. For instance, if we assume that evaluating formula_6 takes as much time as evaluating its derivative and we neglect all other costs, we can do two steps of the secant method (decreasing the logarithm of the error by a factor &quot;φ&quot;2 ≈ 2.6) for the same cost as one step of Newton&#x27;s method (decreasing the logarithm of the error by a factor of 2), so the secant method is faster. In higher dimensions, the full set of partial derivatives required for Newton&#x27;s method, that is, the Jacobian matrix, may become much more expensive to calculate than the function itself. If, however, we consider parallel processing for the evaluation of the derivative or derivatives, Newton&#x27;s method can be faster in clock time though still costing more computational operations overall.

==Generalization==

Broyden&#x27;s method is a generalization of the secant method to more than one dimension.

The following graph shows the function &quot;f&quot; in red and the last secant line in bold blue. In the graph, the &quot;x&quot; intercept of the secant line seems to be a good approximation of the root of &quot;f&quot;.

==Computational example==
Below, the secant method is implemented in the Python programming language. 

It is then applied to find a root of the function with initial points formula_28 and formula_29
def secant_method(f, x0, x1, iterations):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the root calculated using the secant method.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 for i in range(iterations):
 x2 = x1 - f(x1) * (x1 - x0) / float(f(x1) - f(x0))
 x0, x1 = x1, x2
 # Apply a stopping criterion here (see below)
 return x2

def f_example(x):
 return x ** 2 - 612

root = secant_method(f_example, 10, 30, 5)

print(f&quot;Root: {root}&quot;) # Root: 24.738633748750722

It is very important to have a good stopping criterion above, otherwise, due to limited numerical precision of floating point numbers, the algorithm can return inaccurate results if running for too many iterations. For example, the loop above can stop when one of these is reached first: abs(x0 - x1) &lt; tol, or abs(x0/x1-1) &lt; tol, or abs(f(x1)) &lt; tol.

<doc id="640755" wikidata="Q487192" url="?curid=640755" title="Gun barrel">
<text>A gun barrel is a crucial part of gun-type weapons such as small firearms, artillery pieces, and air guns. It is the straight shooting tube, usually made of rigid high-strength metal, through which a contained rapid expansion of high-pressure gas(es) is used to propel a projectile out of the front end (muzzle) at a high velocity. The hollow interior of the barrel is called the bore, and the diameter of the bore is called its calibre, usually measured in inches or millimetres.

The first firearms were made at a time when metallurgy was not advanced enough to cast tubes capable of withstanding the explosive forces of early cannons, so the pipe (often built from staves of metal) needed to be braced periodically along its length for structural reinforcement, producing an appearance somewhat reminiscent of storage barrels being stacked together, hence the English name.

== History ==

Gun barrels are usually made of some type of metal or metal alloy. However, during the late Tang dynasty, Chinese inventors discovered gunpowder, and used bamboo, which has a strong, naturally tubular stalk and is cheaper to obtain and process, as the first barrels in gunpowder projectile weapons such as fire lances. The Chinese were also the first to master cast-iron cannon barrels, and used the technology to make the earliest infantry firearms — the hand cannons. Early European guns were made of wrought iron, usually with several strengthening bands of the metal wrapped around circular wrought iron rings and then welded into a hollow cylinder. Bronze and brass were favoured by gunsmiths, largely because of their ease of casting and their resistance to the corrosive effects of the combustion of gunpowder or salt water when used on naval vessels.

Early firearms were muzzleloaders, with the gunpowder and then the shot loaded from the front end (muzzle) of the barrel, and were capable of only a low rate of fire due to the cumbersome loading process. The later-invented breech-loading designs provided a higher rate of fire, but early breechloaders lacked an effective way of sealing the escaping gases that leaked from the back end (breech) of the barrel, reducing the available muzzle velocity. During the 19th century, effective breechblocks were invented that sealed a breechloader against the escape of propellant gases.

Early cannon barrels were very thick for their caliber. This was because manufacturing defects such as air bubbles trapped in the metal were common at that time, and played key factors in many gun explosions; these defects made the barrel too weak to withstand the pressures of firing, causing it to fail and fragment explosively.

== Construction ==

A gun barrel must be able to hold in the expanding gas produced by the propellants to ensure that optimum muzzle velocity is attained by the projectile as it is being pushed out. If the barrel material cannot cope with the pressure within the bore, the barrel itself might suffer catastrophic failure and explode, which will not only destroy the gun but also present a life-threatening danger to people nearby. Modern small arms barrels are made of carbon steel or stainless steel materials known and tested to withstand the pressures involved. Artillery pieces are made by various techniques providing reliably sufficient strength.

=== Fluting ===
Fluting is the removal of material from a cylindrical surface, usually creating rounded grooves, for the purpose of reducing weight. This is most often done to the exterior surface of a rifle barrel, though it may also be applied to the cylinder of a revolver or the bolt of a bolt-action rifle. Most flutings on rifle barrels and revolver cylinders are straight, though helical flutings can be seen on rifle bolts and occasionally also rifle barrels.

While the main purpose of fluting is just to reduce weight and improve portability, when adequately done it can retain the structural strength and rigidity and increase the overall specific strength. Fluting will also increase the surface-to-volume ratio and make the barrel more efficient to cool after firing, though the reduced material mass also means the barrel will heat up easily during firing.

=== Composite barrels ===
A composite barrel is a firearm barrel that has been shaved down to be thinner and an exterior sleeve slipped over and fused to it that improves rigidity, weight and cooling. Most common form of composite barrel are those with carbon fiber sleeves, but there are proprietary examples such as the Teludyne Tech Straitjacket. They are seldom used outside sports and competition shooting.

== Mounting ==
A barrel can be fixed to the receiver using action threads or rivets. Depending on construction different gun barrels can be used:
* common fixed barrel for firearms
* interchangeable barrel for firearms
* quick-change barrel for machineguns
* replacement gun barrel (spare barrel) for artilleryguns

== Components ==
=== Chamber ===

The chamber is the cavity at the back end of a breech-loading gun&#x27;s barrel where the cartridge is inserted in position ready to be fired. In most firearms (rifles, shotguns, machine guns and pistols), the chamber is an integral part of the barrel, often made by simply reaming the rear bore of a barrel blank, with a single chamber within a single barrel. In revolvers, the chamber is a component of the gun&#x27;s cylinder and completely separate from the barrel, with a single cylinder having multiple chambers that are rotated in turns into alignment with the barrel in anticipation of being fired.

Structurally, the chamber consists of the body, shoulder and neck, the contour of which closely correspond to the casing shape of the cartridge it is designed to hold. The rear opening of the chamber is the breech of the whole barrel, which is sealed tight from behind by the bolt, making the front direction the path of least resistance during firing. When the cartridge&#x27;s primer is struck by the firing pin, the propellant is ignited and deflagrates, generating high-pressure gas expansion within the cartridge case. However, the chamber (closed from behind by the bolt) restrains the cartridge case (or shell for shotguns) from moving, allowing the bullet (or shot/slug in shotguns) to separate cleanly from the casing and be propelled forward along the barrel to exit out of the front (muzzle) end as a flying projectile.

Chambering a gun is the process of loading a cartridge into the gun&#x27;s chamber, either manually as in single loading, or via operating the weapon&#x27;s own action as in pump action, lever action, bolt action or self-loading actions. In the case of an air gun, a pellet (or slug) itself has no casing to be retained and will be entirely inserted into the chamber (often called &quot;seating&quot; or &quot;loading&quot; the pellet, rather than &quot;chambering&quot; it) before a mechanically pressurized gas is released behind the pellet and propels it forward, meaning that an air gun&#x27;s chamber is functionally equivalent to the freebore portion of a firearm barrel.
In the context of firearms design, manufacturing and modification, the word &quot;chambering&quot; has a different meaning, and refers to fitting a weapon&#x27;s chamber specifically to fire a particular caliber or model of cartridge.

=== Bore ===

The bore is the hollow internal lumen of the barrel, and takes up a vast majority portion of the barrel length. It is the part of the barrel where the projectile (bullet, shot, or slug) is located prior to firing and where it gains speed and kinetic energy during the firing process. The projectile&#x27;s status of motion while travelling down the bore is referred to as its internal ballistics.

Most modern firearms (except muskets, shotguns, most tank guns, and some artillery pieces) and air guns (except some BB guns) have helical grooves called &quot;riflings&quot; machined into the bore wall. When shooting, a rifled bore imparts spin to the projectile about its longitudinal axis, which gyroscopically stabilizes the projectile&#x27;s flight attitude and trajectory after its exit from the barrel (i.e. the external ballistics). Any gun without riflings in the bore is called a &quot;smoothbore&quot; gun.

When a firearm cartridge is chambered, its casing occupies the chamber but its bullet actually protrudes beyond the chamber into the posterior end of the bore. Even in a rifled bore, this short rear section is without rifling, and allows the bullet an initial &quot;run-up&quot; to build up momentum before encountering riflings during shooting. The most posterior part of this unrifled section is called a &quot;freebore&quot;, and is usually cylindrical. The portion of the unrifled bore immediately front of the freebore, called the &quot;leade&quot;, starts to slightly and guides the bullet towards the area where the riflingless bore transitions into fully rifled bore. Together they form the throat region, where the riflings impactfully &quot;bite&quot; into the moving bullet during shooting. The throat is subjected to the greatest thermomechanical stress and therefore suffers wear the fastest. Throat erosion is often the main determining factor of a gun&#x27;s barrel life.

=== Muzzle ===


The muzzle is the front end of a barrel from which the projectile will exit. Precise machining of the muzzle is crucial to accuracy, because it is the last point of contact between the barrel and the projectile. If inconsistent gaps exist between the muzzle and the projectile, escaping propellant gases may spread unevenly and deflect the projectile from its intended path (see transitional ballistics). The muzzle can also be threaded on the outside to allow the attachment of different accessory devices.

In rifled barrels, the contour of a muzzle is designed to keep the rifling safe from damage by intruding foreign objects, so the front ends of the rifling grooves are commonly protected behind a recessed crown, which also serves to modulate the even expansion of the propellant gases. The crown itself is often recessed from the outside rim of the muzzle to avoid accidental damage from collision with the surrounding environment.

In smooth bore barrels firing multiple sub-projectiles (such as shotgun shot), the bore at the muzzle end might have a tapered constriction called &quot;choke&quot; to shape the scatter pattern for better range and accuracy. Chokes are implemented as either interchangeable screw-in chokes for particular applications, or as fixed permanent chokes integral to the barrel.

During firing, a bright flash of light known as a &quot;muzzle flash&quot; is often seen at the muzzle. This flash is produced by both superheated propellant gases radiating energy during expansion (primary flash), and the incompletely combusted propellant residues reacting vigorously with the fresh supply of ambient air upon escaping the barrel (secondary flash). The size of the flash depends on factors such as barrel length (shorter barrels have less time for complete combustion, hence more unburnt powder), the type (fast- vs. slow-burning) and amount of propellant (higher total amount means likely more unburnt residues) loaded in the cartridge. Flash suppressors or muzzle shrouds can be attached to the muzzle of the weapon to either diminish or conceal the flash.

The rapid expansion of propellant gases at the muzzle during firing also produce a powerful shockwave known as a &quot;muzzle blast&quot;. The audible component of this blast, also known as a &quot;muzzle report&quot;, is the loud &quot;bang&quot; sound of gunfire that can easily exceed 140 decibels and cause permanent hearing loss to the shooter and bystanders. The non-audible component of the blast is an infrasonic overpressure wave that can cause damage to nearby fragile objects. Accessory devices such as muzzle brakes and muzzle boosters can be used to redirect muzzle blast in order to counter the recoil-induced muzzle rise or to assist the gas operation of the gun, and suppressors (and even muzzle shrouds) can be used to reduce the blast noise intensity felt by nearby personnel.

<text>Aston Clinton House (also known as Green Park though referred to as simply Aston Clinton by the Rothschild family) was a large mansion to the south-east of the village of Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire, England.

== History ==

=== Rothschild period ===
In 1851, Anthony Nathan de Rothschild bought the estate from a banker from Aylesbury. By 1853, he had completed the modernisation of Aston Clinton House and extensive estates in the area, with the help of the architect George Henry Stokes and the builder George Myers. From 1864 to 1877, the architect George Devey designed the cottages and the park gates (he later transformed another Rothschild property, Ascott House). Old photographs of the house show a sprawling neo-Georgian/Italianate house with verandahs and a large porte-cochère. Many workers&#x27; cottages were built, and two schools and a village hall set up under Rothschild patronage.

On the death of Lady Louise de Rothschild in 1910, the house was bequeathed to her two daughters, Constance, Lady Battersea and Annie, The Hon. Mrs. Eliot Yorke, who shared it as a holiday home, spending a few weeks together there each summer. They developed horticulture in the gardens which became full of rare plants. Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea contributed to the development of the gardens.

In the First World War, like the adjoining Halton House and estate, Aston Clinton House was lent to the War Office, becoming in September 1914 the HQ of 21st Infantry Division. 21st Division was a &quot;New Army&quot; division, part of Kitchener&#x27;s Army, and it was formed-up and trained on Rothschild land in Buckinghamshire, initially in Tring but in 1915 on the Halton and Aston Clinton estates. Four brigades of field artillery and one heavy battery received their advanced training in the grounds of Aston Clinton House in the spring and summer of 1915, including extensive gas offensive and defensive training. Final inspection of the division by Lord Kitchener occurred in August 1915 and the move to France took place from 2 to 13 September 1915.

In 1923, the Rothschilds sold the house to Dr Albert Edward Bredin Crawford for £15,000.

=== After 1923 ===
At the start of the Second World War the house was the Green Park Hotel, but during the War the stables were used by EKCO, an electronics company from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, as its main headquarters and for radar research and development, and the main house was used as a hospital for war wounded. It had been a boys&#x27; prep school (where Evelyn Waugh obtained his second post as a junior master in 1925)), followed by a further brief spell as a hotel. The main building was demolished between 1956 and 1958.

Buckinghamshire County Council then acquired the property with the proviso that it be used for educational purposes. Today the estate is used as a residential training centre for young people, operated by Kingswood Learning and Leisure Group. The original ornamental features of the extended garden still remain, incorporated into the site now called Green Park. All that remain of the buildings of the estate are the stables, used as part of the training centre, and the lodge in Stablebridge Road.

<doc id="640762" wikidata="Q1301929" url="?curid=640762" title="Tansy beetle">
<text>The tansy beetle (Chrysolina graminis) is a species of leaf beetle. The common name derives from its main foodplant, tansy (&quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot;), but it can also use other wetland plants such as gypsywort (&quot;Lycopus europaeus&quot;) and water mint (&quot;Mentha aquatica).&quot; It measures 7.7–10.5 mm in length and has a characteristic bright metallic green colouration, with pitted elytra and a coppery tinge. In addition to the nominotypical subspecies, which repeats the specific name, &quot;C. graminis graminis&quot;, there are five further distinct subspecies of tansy beetle, which, collectively, have a Palearctic distribution, although in the majority of countries where it is found the species is declining. In the United Kingdom it is designated as &#x27;Nationally Rare&#x27;. The stronghold population here is located along the banks of the river Ouse in York, North Yorkshire. Other, small, fenland populations exist at Woodwalton Fen and at Welney Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) reserve.

==Taxonomy==
The tansy beetle was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Chrysomela graminis&quot; and was later transferred to the genus &quot;Chrysolina&quot;. The genus &quot;Chrysolina&quot; currently contains 39 subgenera. &quot;C. graminis&quot; (with its several subspecies) is located in the subgenus &quot;Euchrysolina&quot; which contains only one other species – &quot;C. virgata&quot;; this subgenus was first established in 1950.

Its specific name &quot;graminis&quot; is a form of the Latin noun &quot;gramen&quot;, meaning &quot;of grass&quot; or &quot;grass-like&quot;. &quot;Chrysolina graminis&quot; sensu lato has at least three later binomial names which are considered to be synonyms: &quot;Chrysomela fulgida&quot; Fabricius, 1801, &quot;Chrysolina nigrocuprea&quot; Mallet, 1924, and &quot;Chrysolina taupini&quot; Mallet, 1924.

There are six subspecies of tansy beetle. The nominotypical subspecies &quot;C. graminis graminis&quot; was established via the original description of the species in 1758. &quot;C. graminis santonici&quot; (named after the Italian name, Santonico, for its host plant &quot;Artemisia caerulescens&quot;) was described by N. B. Contarini in 1847. In 1860 Victor Motschulsky described two subspecies – &quot;C. graminis artemisiae&quot; and &quot;C. graminis auraria&quot;. These were added to in the 20th century with &quot;C. graminis christianae&quot; (Mallet, 1933) and &quot;C. graminis mediterranea&quot; Bechyné, 1950.

The subspecies of &quot;C. graminis&quot; have localised distributions: &quot;C. graminis artemisiae&quot; is located in south-east Europe, central Asia, and southern Siberia; &quot;C. graminis auraria&quot; is located in Dauria, eastern Mongolia, and China; &quot;C. graminis christianae&quot; is located in France; &quot;C. graminis mediterranea&quot; is located in Corsica and Spain; &quot;C. graminis santonici&quot; is located in the central Alps.

==Description==
All tansy beetles are small, rounded beetles approximately 7–12 mm in length. There are both internal and external morphological differences between the six subspecies.

===Larvae===
The larvae of &quot;C. graminis&quot; have four instar stages, though the first instar may not possess the characteristics of the later instars. Larvae are brown, and dorsally convex with spiracles evident on eight segments. They usually have small, indistinct tubercles with very short setae. The head of each larva is a darker brown than the body and has six ocelli on each side. The mandibles have five apical teeth.

===Distinguishing &quot;Chrysolina graminis&quot; and &quot;Chrysolina herbacea&quot;===

&quot;Chrysolina graminis&quot; and &quot;C. herbacea&quot; are similar in size and colour and may be confused in UK populations. Distinguishing the two species in the United Kingdom is particularly important as &quot;C. graminis&quot; is a vulnerable species whereas &quot;C. herbacea&quot; is much more common. This has previously led to the misidentification of &quot;C. herbacea&quot; as &quot;C. graminis&quot;. &quot;C. herbacea&quot; measures 7–11 mm in length. It is coloured iridescent green on dorsal surface throughout. The punctuation on the pronotum and elytra is distinctly similar, unlike in &quot;C. graminis&quot;. There is a smooth lip running only half the length of the ventral edge of the elytra, whereas this lip runs the full length on &quot;C. graminis&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological excavation has shown that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least as early as the Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on tansy (&quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot;) and water mint (&quot;Mentha aquatica&quot;) in fen land and the banks of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: &quot;Achillea ptarmica&quot; (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus &quot;Artemisia&quot; in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.

===Distribution===
In continental Europe, &quot;C. graminis&quot; is widespread from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. It may also be found in central Asia and China. In Russia it may be found in the tundra zone from the Polar Urals to the Kolyma River, and in the nearby countries of Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. It is listed as vulnerable in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and in Germany it is rare in one district, endangered in another.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, its range is currently restricted to about 45 km of the banks of the River Ouse centred on York, North Yorkshire. Although there are scattered records from across England some of these may represent mis-identifications of the mint beetle, a more widespread species. Tansy beetles had previously been recorded from Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire, where species of mint (&quot;Mentha&quot; spp.), not tansy, acted as the host plant. The last accurate record for the beetle at this site was in 1981. In August 2014 a new sighting was made nearby at Woodwalton Fen, following this a translocation programme of Yorkshire beetles was attempted to boost the population. However, this was unsuccessful, likely due to potentially differing biologies between the two populations.

As of 2006 there were 19 British hectads (10 km squares) with records of the tansy beetle, but it has only been seen in 11 of these since 1970, six of which are centred around York. In 2015, the total number of individuals estimated from a survey of this area on the banks of the River Ouse was 24,000. In 2016 this number increased significantly to 40,000. Since 2018, the beetle has also been discovered at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) reserve at Welney, west Norfolk.

===Threats to habitat===
The decline in &quot;C. graminis&quot; is likely to be due to habitat loss resulting from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction. Neglect may also lead to loss or degradation of habitat such as through over-shading or competition of food plants with invasive species such as Himalayan balsam (&quot;Impatiens glandulifera&quot;). Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.

Within the York distribution the beetles are dependent on tansy as their sole food source; if a clump disappears the beetles are forced to walk to a new location as they rarely fly, despite having fully working wings and being capable of doing so. The loss of habitat impacts upon the ability of the tansy beetle to find an alternative source of the host plant. Additionally, tansy is a ruderal species and thus has a naturally high rate of turnover of plants, forcing beetles to regularly seek out new tansy patches to colonise.

A 2009 study of tansy beetle occupancy amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by no more than 50 cm) of the tansy plant on the banks of the River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data on the distribution of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy beetle populations in order to contribute to the conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3 m and that these patches should be targeted within 200 m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the beetle population disperse and survive.

==Life cycle==

Both adults and larvae use the same host plant during their life cycle. As tansy often grows in discrete clumps, the total population of &quot;C. graminis&quot; in an area may be divided and individuals may spend their entire life cycle within an area of a few square metres.

Adults mate between March and June. In the monitored populations at York, mating of the same pair could last over 24 hours, during which time some pairs moved between tansy patches. Mating in a Russian population of &quot;C. graminis&quot; is preceded by an elaborate ritual not evident in other populations of the species, involving the male tapping the female&#x27;s eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae. Mated females lay batches of 3–15 elongated, yellow eggs (each 2 mm long) on the underside of the tansy leaves. Eggs hatch into grey larvae. In captivity, one newly mated female produced 561 eggs over 136 days and another produced 158 eggs over 49 days. Females will lay in several locations; the average clutch size is 5–6 eggs. Female &quot;C. graminis&quot; will cannibalise the eggs of other females. In laboratory conditions, newly hatched larvae have been shown to survive for at least four days without food and thus have a long window of opportunity in which to reach a tansy plant. In July, the final instar larvae burrow underground beneath the plant to pupate, although very little is known about the biology of this process in &quot;C. graminis&quot;. Between August and September, this new adult population emerges to feed before returning underground to overwinter in October; emergence of adults is from March to April the next year. Long-term monitoring has indicated that survival during winter hibernation is surprisingly high, as autumn and spring population sizes are very similar. This is despite annual winter flooding of the River Ouse, implying that overwintering individuals must be extremely tolerant of long periods of inundation and oxygen deprivation. Approximately 5% of overwintering adults do not emerge from the soil after the winter, but remain underground for the next year in a state of extended diapause and emerge in the following spring.

A few adult beetles may overlap between the spring and summer populations, but most adults from the earlier emergence die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unable to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Diet===
Tansy beetles are herbivorous and primarily use tansy (&quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot;) as their host plant. The species has, however, also been recorded consuming a wider range of food plants including &quot;Lycopus europaeus&quot; (gipsywort), &quot;Stachys palustris&quot; (marsh woundwort), &quot;Achillea ptarmica&quot; (sneezewort), &quot;Mentha aquatica&quot; (water mint), &quot;Mentha rotundifolia&quot; (false apple mint), as well as other species of the genera &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;, &quot;Scutellaria&quot;, and &quot;Artemisia&quot;. The subspecies &quot;C. graminis santonico&quot; is associated with &quot;Artemisa caerulescens&quot;.

The tansy plant naturally contains a number of volatile components including 1,8-cineole, &quot;trans&quot;-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant. 1,8-cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores. The tansy beetle is resistant to these chemicals. However, tansy is a repellent to other Chrysomelid beetles. For example, the steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and is strongly repellent to the Colorado potato beetle (&quot;Leptinotarsa decemlineata&quot;).

===Predation===
Beetle remains bearing what appeared to be the marks of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as &#x27;pinch marks&#x27; inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of &quot;C. graminis&quot; by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly &quot;Panorpa germanica&quot; has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus &quot;Macquartia&quot; exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, &quot;Macquartia dispar&quot;, may parasitise &quot;C. graminis&quot; directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.

Larvae of other Chrysomelids are predated by birds, coccinellids, predatory bugs, lacewing larvae, syrphid larvae, carabids, ants, wasps, spiders and harvestmen, all of which are common on the tansy around the York population. The pupal stage may be directly predated by the European mole.

===Parasites===
A mite, &quot;Chrysomelobia mahunkai&quot; (family Podapolipidae) has been recorded from a single adult specimen of &quot;C. graminis&quot;, and &quot;Eulophus chrysomela&quot; (a species of hymenopteran of the family Eulophidae) is recorded as an endoparasite of the pupal stage.

==Relationship with humans==
===Conservation in the United Kingdom===
The species is formally designated as &#x27;Nationally Rare&#x27; in the United Kingdom and categorised as a &#x27;Species of Principal Importance&#x27; in accordance with the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. The Tansy Beetle Action Group was set up in 2008 to initiate and oversee conservation efforts and comprises representatives from the University of York, North Yorkshire County Council, City of York Council, Environment Agency and the National Trust. A recovery programme started, involving annual surveys of both tansy and beetles, control of tree shading and invasive plants that compete with tansy, such as Himalayan balsam, and limited re-introductions within the current species range. New clumps of tansy have been planted, particularly between isolated existing patches which may be beyond the 200 m walking range of the beetle. In order to publicise the conservation project Rachael Maskell, the Member of Parliament for the constituency of York Central became a &#x27;Tansy Beetle Species Champion&#x27; in 2016. That same year, a team of 30 volunteers surveyed a 90 km stretch of the banks of the River Ouse. The surveying has identified an upward trend in population numbers, rising over 60% between 2015 and 2016 to 40,000 individuals. In October 2019 a large mural of a tansy beetle was painted on the side of a house in Queen Street, York by street artist ATM.
===Public reception in York===

The Tansy beetle&#x27;s relationship to York has led to it having a prominent public presence. In January 2022 a large mural depicting a tansy beetle was painted on a building on Queen&#x27;s Street, York by street artist ATM. In August 2024 a series of 17 metal tansy beetle sculptures were displayed in York and decorated by local artists to highlight historical &#x27;trailblazers&#x27; in the city.

<text>A barrel or cask is a hollow cylindrical container with a bulging center, longer than it is wide. They are traditionally made of wooden staves and bound by wooden or metal hoops. The word vat is often used for large containers for liquids, usually alcoholic beverages; a small barrel or cask is known as a keg.

Barrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol. They are also employed to hold maturing beverages such as wine, cognac, armagnac, sherry, port, whiskey, beer, arrack, and sake. Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include gunpowder, meat, fish, paint, honey, nails, and tallow. 

Modern wooden barrels for wine-making are made of French common oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), white oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;), American white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;), more exotic is mizunara oak (&quot;Quercus crispula&quot;), and recently Oregon oak (&quot;Quercus garryana&quot;) has been used.
Someone who makes traditional wooden barrels is called a cooper. Today, barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different types of plastic, such as HDPE.

Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space.

&quot;Barrel&quot; has also been used as a standard size of measure, referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity. For example, in the UK and Ireland, a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of , and is distinguished from other unit measurements, such as firkins, hogsheads, and kilderkins. Wine was shipped in barrels of . A barrel of oil, defined as , is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels. The barrel has also come into use as a generic term for a wooden cask of any size.

==History==
An Egyptian wall-painting in the tomb of Hesy-Ra, dating to 2600 BC, shows a wooden tub used to measure wheat and constructed of staves bound together with wooden hoops. Another Egyptian tomb painting dating to 1900 BC shows a cooper and tubs made of staves in use at the grape harvest. Herodotus () allegedly reports the use of &quot;palm-wood casks&quot; in ancient Babylon, but some modern scholarship disputes this interpretation.

In Europe, buckets and casks dating to 200 BC have been found preserved in the mud of lake villages. A lake village near Glastonbury dating to the late Iron Age has yielded one complete tub and a number of wooden staves.

The Roman historian Pliny the Elder (died 79 AD) reported that cooperage in Europe originated with the Gauls in Alpine villages who stored their beverages in wooden casks bound with hoops. Pliny identified three different types of coopers: ordinary coopers, wine coopers and coopers who made large casks. Large casks contain more and bigger staves and are correspondingly more difficult to assemble. Roman coopers tended to be independent tradesmen, passing their skills on to their sons. The Greek geographer Strabo () recorded that wooden &quot;pithoi&quot; (barrels or wine-jars) were lined with pitch to stop leakage and preserve the wine.

Barrels were sometimes used for military purposes. Julius Caesar (100 to 44 BC) used catapults to hurl burning barrels of tar into besieged towns to start fires. The Romans also used empty barrels to make pontoon bridges to cross rivers.

Empty casks were used to line the walls of shallow wells from at least Roman times. Such casks were found in 1897 during archaeological excavations of Roman Silchester in Britain. They were made of Pyrenean silver fir and the staves were thick and featured grooves where the heads fitted. They had Roman numerals scratched on the surface of each stave to help with re-assembly.

In Anglo-Saxon Britain, wooden barrels were used to store ale, butter, honey and mead. Drinking-containers were also made from small staves of oak, yew or pine. These items required considerable craftsmanship to hold liquids and might be bound with finely-worked precious metals. They were highly valued items and were sometimes buried with the dead as grave goods.

==Uses today==

===Beverage maturing===



An &quot;ageing barrel&quot; is used to age wine; distilled spirits such as whiskey, brandy, or rum; beer; tabasco sauce; or (in smaller sizes) traditional balsamic vinegar. When a wine or spirit ages in a barrel, small amounts of oxygen are introduced as the barrel lets some air in (compare to microoxygenation where oxygen is deliberately added). Oxygen enters a barrel when water or alcohol is lost due to evaporation, a portion known as the &quot;angels&#x27; share&quot;. In an environment with 100% relative humidity, very little water evaporates and so most of the loss is alcohol, a useful trick if one has a wine with very high proof. Most beverages are topped up from other barrels to prevent significant oxidation, although others such as vin jaune and sherry are not.

Beverages aged in wooden barrels take on some of the compounds in the barrel, such as vanillin and wood tannins. The presence of these compounds depends on many factors, including the place of origin, how the staves were cut and dried, and the degree of &quot;toast&quot; applied during manufacture. Barrels used for aging are typically made of French or American oak, but chestnut and redwood are also used. Some Asian beverages (e.g., Japanese sake) use Japanese cedar, which imparts an unusual, minty-piney flavor. In Peru and Chile, a grape distillate named &quot;pisco&quot; is either aged in oak or in earthenware.

====Wines====
Some wines are fermented &quot;on barrel&quot;, as opposed to in a neutral container like steel or wine-grade HDPE (high-density polyethylene) tanks. Wine can also be fermented in large wooden tanks, which—when open to the atmosphere—are called &quot;open-tops&quot;. Other wooden cooperage for storing wine or spirits range from smaller barriques to huge casks, with either elliptical or round heads.

The tastes yielded by French and American species of oak are slightly different, with French oak being subtler, while American oak gives stronger aromas. To retain the desired measure of oak influence, a winery will replace a certain percentage of its barrels every year, although this can vary from 5 to 100%. Some winemakers use &quot;200% new oak&quot;, where the wine is put into new oak barrels twice during the aging process. Bulk wines are sometimes more cheaply flavored by soaking in oak chips or added commercial oak flavoring instead of being aged in a barrel because of the much lower cost.

=====Sherry=====
Sherry is stored in casks made of North American oak, which is slightly more porous than French or Spanish oak. The casks, or butts, are filled five-sixths full, leaving &quot;the space of two fists&quot; empty at the top to allow flor to develop on top of the wine. Sherry is also commonly swapped between barrels of different ages, a process that is known as &quot;solera&quot;.

====Spirits====
=====Whiskey=====
Laws in several jurisdictions require that whiskey be aged in wooden barrels. The law in the United States requires that &quot;straight whiskey&quot; (with the exception of corn whiskey) must be stored for at least two years in new, charred oak containers. Other forms of whiskey aged in used barrels cannot be called &quot;straight&quot;.

International laws require any whisky bearing the label &quot;Scotch&quot; to be distilled and matured in Scotland for a minimum of three years and one day in oak casks.

By Canadian law, Canadian whiskies must &quot;be aged in small wood for not less than three years&quot;, and &quot;small wood&quot; is defined as a wood barrel not exceeding capacity.

Since the U.S. law requires the use of new barrels for several popular types of whiskey, which is not typically considered necessary elsewhere, whiskey made elsewhere is usually aged in used barrels that previously contained American whiskey (usually bourbon whiskey). The typical bourbon barrel is in size, which is thus the &quot;de facto&quot; standard whiskey barrel size worldwide. Some distillers transfer their whiskey into different barrels to &quot;finish&quot; or add qualities to the final product. These finishing barrels frequently aged a different spirit (such as rum) or wine. Other distillers, particularly those producing Scotch, often disassemble five used bourbon barrels and reassemble them into four casks with different barrel ends for aging Scotch, creating a type of cask referred to as a hogshead.

=====Brandy=====
Maturing is very important for a good brandy, which is typically aged in oak casks. The wood used for those barrels is selected because of its ability to transfer certain aromas to the spirit. Cognac is aged only in oak casks made from wood from the Forest of Tronçais and more often from the Limousin forests.

=====Tequila=====
Some types of tequila are aged in oak barrels to mellow its flavor. &quot;Reposado&quot; tequila is aged for a period of two months to one year, &quot;Añejo&quot; tequila is aged for up to three years, and &quot;Extra Añejo&quot; tequila is aged for at least three years. Like with other spirits, longer aging results in a more pronounced flavor.

====Beer====
Beers are sometimes aged in barrels which were previously used for maturing wines or spirits. This is most common in darker beers such as stout, which is sometimes aged in oak barrels identical to those used for whiskey. Whisky distiller Jameson notably purchases barrels used by Franciscan Well brewery for their Shandon Stout to produce a whisky branded as &quot;Jameson Caskmates&quot;. Cask ale is aged in the barrel (usually steel) for a short time before serving. Extensive barrel aging is required of many sour beers.

====Condiments====
=====Balsamic vinegar=====
Traditional balsamic vinegar is aged in a series of wooden barrels.

=====Tabasco sauce=====
The pepper mash used to make Tabasco sauce is aged for three years in previously used oak whiskey barrels since its invention in 1868.

====Soft drinks====
Vernors ginger ale is marketed as having a &quot;barrel-aged&quot; flavor, and the syrup used to produce the beverage was originally aged in oak barrels when first manufactured in the 19th century. Whether the syrup continues to be aged in oak is unclear.
====Angels&#x27; share====


&quot;Angels&#x27; share&quot; is a term for the portion (share) of a wine or distilled spirit&#x27;s volume that is lost to evaporation during aging in oak barrels. The ambient humidity tends to affect the composition of this share. Drier conditions tend to make the barrels evaporate more water, strengthening the spirit. However, in higher humidities, more alcohol than water will evaporate, therefore reducing the alcoholic strength of the product. This alcoholic evaporate encourages the growth of a darkly colored fungus, the angels&#x27; share fungus, &quot;Baudoinia compniacensis&quot;, which tends to appear on the exterior surfaces of most things in the immediate area.

===Water storage===
Water barrels are often used to collect the rainwater from dwellings (so that it may be used for irrigation or other purposes). This usage, known as rainwater harvesting, requires (besides a large rainwater barrel or water butt) adequate (waterproof) roof-covering and an adequate rain pipe.

===Oil storage===

Wooden casks of various sizes were used to store whale oil on ships in the age of sail. Its viscous nature made sperm whale oil a particularly difficult substance to contain in staved containers. Oil coopers were probably the most skilled coopers in pre-industrial cooperage. Olive oil, seed oils and other organic oils were also placed in wooden casks for storage or transport.

Wooden casks were also used to store mineral oil. The standard size barrel of crude oil or other petroleum product (abbreviated bbl) is . This measurement originated in the early Pennsylvania oil fields, and permitted both British and American merchants to refer to the same unit, based on the old English wine measure, the tierce.

Earlier, another size of whiskey barrel was the most common size; this was the barrel for proof spirits, which was of the same volume as five US bushels. However, by 1866, the oil barrel was standardized at 42 US gallons.

Oil has not been shipped in barrels since the introduction of oil tankers, but the 42 US gallon size is still used as a unit of measurement for pricing and tax and regulatory codes. Each barrel is refined into about of gasoline, the rest becoming other products such as jet fuel and heating oil, using fractional distillation.

==Barrel shape, construction and parts==


Barrels have a convex shape and bulge at their center, called bilge. This facilitates rolling a well-built wooden barrel on its side and allows the roller to change directions with little friction, compared to a cylinder. It also helps to distribute stress evenly in the material by making the container more curved. Barrels have reinforced edges to enable safe displacement by rolling them at an angle (in addition to rolling on their sides as described). 

Casks used for ale or beer have shives and keystones in their openings. Before serving the beer, a spile is hammered into the shive and a tap into the keystone. 

The wooden parts that make up a barrel are called staves, the top and bottom are both called heads or headers, and the rings that hold the staves together are called hoops. These are usually made of galvanized iron, though historically they were made of flexible bits of wood called withies. While wooden hoops could require barrels to be &quot;fully hooped&quot;, with hoops stacked tightly together along the entire top and bottom third of a barrel, iron-hooped barrels only require a few hoops on each end.

Wine barrels typically come in two hoop configurations. An American barrel features six hoops, from top to center: head- or chime hoop, quarter hoop and bilge hoop (times two), while a French barrel features eight, including a so-called French hoop, located between the quarter- and bilge hoops (see &quot;wine barrel parts&quot; illustration). 

The opening at the center of a barrel is called a bung hole and the stopper used to seal it is a bung. The latter is generally made of white silicone.

==Sizes==

A barrel is one of several units of volume, with dry barrels, fluid barrels (UK beer barrel, US beer barrel), oil barrel, etc. The volume of some barrel units is double others, with various volumes in the range of about .

===English wine casks===

The pre-1824 wine gallon continues to be used in the US, with 231 cubic inches being the standard gallon for liquids. In Britain and its colonies, the wine gallon was replaced by the imperial gallon in 1826. The tierce later became the petrol barrel.

The tun was originally 256 gallons, which explains the origin of the quarter, 8 bushels or 64 (wine) gallons.

===Brewery casks===
Although it is common to refer to draught beer containers of any size as barrels, in the UK this is strictly correct only if the container holds 36 imperial gallons. The terms &quot;keg&quot; and &quot;cask&quot; refer to containers of any size, the distinction being that kegs are used for beers intended to be served using external gas cylinders. Cask ales undergo part of their fermentation process in their containers, called casks.

Casks are available in several sizes, and it is common to refer to &quot;a firkin&quot; or &quot;a kil&quot; (kilderkin) instead of a cask.

The modern US beer barrel is , half a gallon less than the traditional wine barrel (26 U.S.C. §5051).

===Dry goods===
Barrels are also used as a unit of measurement for dry goods (dry groceries), such as flour or produce. Traditionally, a barrel is of flour (wheat or rye), with other substances such as pork subject to more local variation. In modern times, produce barrels for all dry goods, excepting cranberries, contain 7,056 cubic inches, about 115.627 L.

In the northeastern United States, nails, bolts, and plumbing fittings were commonly shipped in small rough barrels. These were small, 18 inches high by about 10–12 inches in diameter. The wood was the quality of pallet lumber. The binding was sometimes by wire or metal hoops or both. This practice seems to have been prevalent up till the 1980s. Older hardware stores probably still have some of these barrels.

<text>Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson (; 2 December 1840 – 7 September 1922) was an English artist and bookbinder associated with the Arts and Crafts movement.

==Life==
Sanderson was born in Alnwick, Northumberland. His father, James, was a District Surveyor of taxes, thirteen years younger than his wife, Mary Ann (née Rutherford How). Sanderson attended a number of schools including the Royal Grammar School Worcester before entering Owen&#x27;s College (Manchester University) and then Trinity College, Cambridge to study law. He left without taking a degree, and entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn as a barrister. In 1882 he married (Julia Sarah) Anne Cobden, a socialist, and daughter of Richard Cobden, and they both took the surname Cobden-Sanderson.

As a friend of William Morris, Cobden-Sanderson was involved with the Arts and Crafts ideology, and during a dinner party with the Morrises he was persuaded by Morris&#x27;s wife Jane Burden to take up book-binding. In about 1884 he opened a workshop, abandoning his law practice. In 1887 Cobden-Sanderson suggested a new group be named the &quot;Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society,&quot; and in so doing gave the movement its name. His wife was concerned that his interests were too abstract and she encouraged him to become a bookbinder. In 1893 he set up the Doves Bindery in Hammersmith, London, naming it after a nearby pub, The Dove. It was his wife who took credit for keeping the business running. By 1900 he had established the Doves Press. Emery Walker became a partner in 1900 and oversaw the creation of the Doves Type used for all of their books. They produced a number of letterpress books, including a five-volume Doves Bible.

By 1909 Cobden-Sanderson and his partner Emery Walker were at the height of a protracted and bitter dispute involving the rights to the Doves Type in the dissolution of their partnership. As part of the partnership dissolution agreement, all rights to the Doves Type were to pass to Emery Walker upon the death of Cobden-Sanderson. Yet, when the press closed in 1916 Cobden-Sanderson threw the type along with its punches and matrices into the Thames. In this time, as there was no digitization, destroying the punches and matrices constituted destroying the typeface itself.

Until recently the Doves Typeface was thought to have been lost forever. 
However, a digital version of the typeface was painstakingly recreated by Robert Green from 2010 to 2013. In 2015, after searching the riverbed of the Thames near Hammersmith Bridge with help from the Port of London Authority, Green managed to recover 150 pieces of the original type.

Cobden-Sanderson was a friend of John Russell, Viscount Amberley and his wife Kate, and made godfather of their son, the Nobel Prize in Literature-winning philosopher and activist Bertrand Russell; it &#x27;had been long arranged that, boy or girl, (he) was to be godfather&#x27;. Amberley had hoped that, in the event of his death, Cobden-Sanderson and the other godfather, biologist D. A. Spalding (who had tutored the Amberleys&#x27; children and lived in the household), as staunch atheists, would shield his son from a religious upbringing; after his parents&#x27; deaths Bertrand was however taken in by his grandparents, John Russell, 1st Earl Russell (Prime Minister from 1846–52, and again from 1865-6) and his second wife, Frances, daughter of Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Earl of Minto, under threat of legal action. When Russell was convicted in 1918 for a public lecture against inviting the United States to participate in the First World War on the side of the United Kingdom, Cobden-Sanderson sent an encouraging letter of support (&#x27;with old and constant affection&#x27;) expressing that he wished Russell&#x27;s mother was alive to see her son&#x27;s actions, part of what he considered &#x27;a life fitted to the wonderful scene about (Russell)&#x27;.

<text>The Liberal–Labour banner has been used several times by candidates in Canadian elections:

In the early twentieth century when the idea of trade unionists running for elected office under their own banner gained ground, several working class candidates on the provincial or federal level were elected on a Labour ticket. Once elected, in the absence of an organized Labour Party, an MP elected on a Labour ticket would often support, or join, the Liberal Party of Canada and would often be described as &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot;

At other times, the Liberal Party, particularly under William Lyon Mackenzie King would try to co-opt the trade union vote by running Liberal supporters as Labour or Liberal–Labour candidates. These would be official or unofficial &quot;fusion&quot; candidates who would run in the absence of a straight Liberal candidate.

*Ralph Smith was a miner who won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1898 on a Liberal–Labour platform. In the 1900 federal election he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal–Labour candidate, defeating the official Liberal candidate. He immediately joined the Liberal Party caucus of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and subsequently ran and won re-election as a straight Liberal against Conservative and Socialist opponents.
*Alphonse Verville was president of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada when he was elected as a Labour candidate in a 1906 by-election in Maisonneuve. Verville was elected by defeating a Liberal opponent, however, in subsequent elections the Liberals ran no candidate in Maisonneuve and threw their support to Verville who would generally support Sir Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberals in the House of Commons of Canada. In the 1917 federal election on conscription, Verville ran and was re-elected as a Laurier-Liberal.
*Malcolm Lang, who was elected as a Labour Party of Canada Member of Parliament in the 1926 federal election, failed to get re-elected as &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; in the north-eastern Ontario riding of Timiskaming South in the 1930 federal election.
*Humphrey Mitchell was elected as a Labour MP in a 1931 by-election in Hamilton East. He was unopposed by the Mackenzie King Liberals and generally voted with the Liberal caucus while having a poor relationship with other Labour MPs in parliament. He refused to join the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation when it was formed the next year and, in the 1935 federal election ran for re-election as a Labour MP. The Liberals supported Mitchell unofficially and did not run a candidate against him. The CCF, however, did stand a candidate in Hamilton East resulting in the labour vote being split and Mitchell&#x27;s defeat at the hands of a Conservative in a year where the Conservatives lost dozens of seats. Mitchell returned to parliament during World War II as a Liberal MP and cabinet minister.
*From 1949 to 1965, William Moore Benidickson represented the north-western Ontario riding of Kenora-Rainy River as a Liberal–Labour Member of Parliament. Benidickson was elected as a Liberal MP in the 1945 federal election, but ran subsequently as &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; as the result of an informal electoral pact between the Labor-Progressive Party (i.e., the Communist Party of Canada) and the Liberal Party of Canada (see also Ontario legislature, below.)

Benidickson was succeeded in that riding by John Mercer Reid, who was elected as a &quot;Liberal&quot; in 1965 but then sat as a &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; MP from the 1968 federal election until the 1972 federal election, when he changed his designation back to &quot;Liberal&quot;. In the 1988 federal election, Liberal candidate Bob Nault identified himself as &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; on some of his literature (particularly those distributed at plant gates) in his successful attempt to defeat NDP incumbent John Parry who had defeated Reid in 1984. Nault was officially listed as a straight Liberal on the ballot and in his official designation when he became an MP.

*In the 1935 federal election, three candidates ran in Quebec ridings, placing last in each case, and drawing no more than 1.5% of the vote in each case. In all three ridings, at least one other candidate ran as a &quot;Liberal&quot;.
*In the 1945 federal election, one candidate ran as a &quot;Liberal Labour&quot; candidate in the Quebec riding of Mercier, placing last in a field of seven, with 345 votes, 1.0% of the total.
*In the 1949 federal election, one candidate ran as a &quot;Liberal Labour&quot; candidate in the Quebec riding of Stanstead, placing last in a field of four, with 433 votes, 2.6% of the total.

==Liberal Labour Party==
The Liberal Labour Party name has been used twice in Canadian elections, though it may have been just a convenient label for those two candidates rather than an organized political party.

In the 1926 federal election, Alexander Jarvis McComber, a barrister, placed second in a field of three candidates in the north-western Ontario riding of Port Arthur – Thunder Bay, winning 2,990 votes, 26% of the total. No candidate ran as a &quot;Liberal&quot;, but the third place candidate ran as a &quot;Labour&quot; candidate.

In a 22 March 1954 by-election in Verdun, Quebec, Hervé Ferland, an advertising agent, placed fifth in a field of seven candidates, which included one &quot;Liberal&quot; and two &quot;Independent Liberals&quot;. He won 2,180 votes, 8.7% of the total.

==Liberal Labour Progressive==
In the 1926 federal election, the only opponent of the victorious Conservative candidate in the Algoma West riding in northern Ontario ran as a Liberal Labour Progressive candidate. Albert Ernest Whytall won 4,187 votes, or 37% of the total.

==Ontario legislature==
In the 1945 Ontario provincial election, the Communist Party (running as the Labor-Progressive Party) decided to run six candidates jointly with the Liberal Party of Ontario under Mitchell Hepburn. This was an attempt to marginalise the Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in elections to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

The United Auto Workers (UAW) participated in the effort and ran three Liberal–Labour candidates against CCF incumbents in Windsor including George Burt, Canadian director of the UAW, Alexander A. Parent, a Communist and president of UAW Local 195. Parent was elected in Essex North but Burt and Reaume were both defeated, though vote-splitting also resulted in the defeat of two CCF incumbents. Another unsuccessful &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; candidate was Arthur Reaume, mayor of Windsor, who had been a long time Tory and had run for George Drew&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in 1943 provincial election, but broke with his party to support UAW workers at Ford in their fight for the Rand Formula. Reaume ran again as &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; in the 1948 provincial election, without success, and was finally elected in the 1951 provincial election as a &quot;Liberal&quot;.

The other two Liberal–Labour MPPs elected were James Newman of Rainy River and Joseph Meinzinger of Waterloo North, defeating CCF incumbents George Lockhart and John Henry Cook, respectively. Of the three, only Newman would be re-elected in the 1948 provincial election.

The decision by the Liberals, UAW members and Communists to collaborate was ironic given Hepburn&#x27;s vociferous opposition to both Communism and the Congress of Industrial Organizations during his term as Premier of Ontario. Two pro-labour MPPs, David Croll and Arthur Roebuck, had resigned from Hepburn&#x27;s cabinet in 1937 to protest his anti-labour actions during a UAW strike in Oshawa, Ontario. (George Burt was Treasurer of the UAW&#x27;s Oshawa local at the time of the strike.)

The ridings of Kenora and Rainy River (separate ridings provincially, a single riding federally) continued to nominate &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; candidates to both the Ontario legislature and the House of Commons of Canada for decades.

Kenora had previously elected Peter Heenan as a Labour representative in the 1919 election. Heenan remained one of only four Labour MLAs (as MPPs were still known) re-elected in the 1923 election and was defeated in the 1926 election. He then entered federal politics becoming a federal Liberal and joining William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Cabinet as Minister of Labour. In 1929 Earl Hutchinson recaptured Kenora as a Labour MLA. He was re-elected in 1934 but was persuaded to resign a few weeks later in order to allow Heenan to run in the subsequent by-election, this time as a Liberal. Heenan was elected and joined Mitchell Hepburn&#x27;s Cabinet serving as Minister of Mines and Forests (1934-1941) and Minister of Labour (1941-1943) while Hutchinson was appointed vice-chairman of the Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Board weeks after his resignation. Heenan was later defeated by William Docker of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the 1943 provincial election in which the Liberals were reduced to third party status. Subsequently, the Liberals ran Albert Wren as a &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; candidate unsuccessfully in the 1948 election before his victory in the 1951 election.

*Albert Wren of Kenora was the longest serving &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; MPP, sitting in the Ontario legislature from 1951 until his death in 1961. He ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1954, coming in second, and again in 1958, coming in last. Robert Gibson succeeded Wren as the &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; MPP for Kenora and served until just prior to the 1967 provincial election.
*T. Patrick Reid was elected &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; MPP for the neighbouring riding of Rainy River in the 1967 provincial election He ran as a &quot;Liberal&quot; in the 1971 provincial election, and 1975 provincial election. He reverted to the &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; label for the 1977 provincial election, and returned to being a &quot;Liberal&quot; MPP in 1981 provincial election, and left politics in 1984.

More recently, Liberals in Kenora such as former Member of Parliament Bob Nault have occasionally used the &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; tag on some of their campaign literature (such as that handed out at plant gates) though they are listed as straight Liberals on the ballot.

<text>Bellona Island is an island of the Rennell and Bellona Province, in Solomon Islands. Its length is about and its average width . Its area is about . It is almost entirely surrounded by high cliffs, consisting primarily of raised coral limestone.

==Population==
Bellona Island is densely populated and its interior is lush and fertile. There are three districts namely Matangi, Ghongau and Ngango. Each district has manaha (tribes) except for Ghongau district, which has two sub-districts; Nguutuanga Bangitakungu and Ngutuanga Bangika&#x27;ango. There are many villages on Bellona Island:
*Matahenua/Matamoana (west)
*Honga&#x27;ubea
*Tongomainge
*Saukapoi
*Ngotokanaba
*Pauta
*Ngongona
*Gongau
*Ahenoa
*Matangi
*NukuTonga (East)

Bellona Island is, like Rennell Island, a Polynesian-inhabited island within the Solomons, where most of the islands are primarily Melanesian with a few Micronesian island provinces. It is thus counted among the Polynesian outliers. The nearby Bellona Shoals were the site of several shipwrecks. On the western end of the island there were sacred stone-gods, at a place called Ngabenga- west Bellona. The stone-gods were destroyed by Seventh-day Adventist missionaries in 1938. This island was named in 1792 after Capt. Mathew Boyd&#x27;s ship &quot;The Bellona&quot;. However, its original name is Mungiki.

<doc id="640775" wikidata="Q44891" url="?curid=640775" title="Breaking ball">
<text>In baseball, a breaking ball is a pitch that does not travel straight as it approaches the batter; it will have sideways or downward motion on it, sometimes both (see slider). A breaking ball is not a specific pitch by that name, but is any pitch that &quot;breaks&quot;, such as a curveball, slider, or screwball. A pitcher who primarily uses breaking ball pitches is often referred to as a &quot;junkballer&quot;.

A breaking ball is more difficult than a straight pitch for a catcher to receive as breaking pitches sometimes hit the ground (whether intentionally, or not) before making it to the plate. A curveball moves down and to the left for a right handed pitcher. For a left hand pitcher, it moves down and to the right. And blocking a breaking ball requires thought and preparation by the catcher. The pitcher then, must have confidence in the catcher, and the catcher in himself, to block any ball in the dirt; if there are runners on base, they will likely advance if the ball gets away from the catcher. (Whether the pitcher is right- or left-handed will dictate which direction the catcher must turn his body to adjust for the spin of an upcoming breaking ball. This necessary movement may reveal the next intended pitch to the batter; therefore an experienced catcher must fake or mask his intentions when preparing for the pitch.)

If a breaking ball fails to break, it is called a &quot;hanging&quot; breaking ball, specifically, a &quot;hanging&quot; curve or even more specifically a &quot;cement mixer&quot; if it is a &quot;hanging&quot; slider that just spins. The &quot;hanger&quot; presents a high, slow pitch that is easy for the batter to see, and often results in an extra-base hit or a home run.

Don Mattingly wrote in &quot;Don Mattingly&#x27;s Hitting Is Simple: The ABC&#x27;s of Batting .300&quot; that &quot;hitting a breaking ball is one of the toughest things you&#x27;ll have to learn&quot; due to the ball&#x27;s very brief window in the strike zone.

==Physics==
Generally the Magnus effect describes the laws of physics that make a curveball curve. A fastball travels through the air with backspin, which creates a higher pressure zone in the air ahead of and under the baseball. The baseball&#x27;s raised seams augment the ball&#x27;s ability to develop a boundary layer and therefore a greater differential of pressure between the upper and lower zones. The effect of gravity is partially counteracted as the ball rides on and into increased pressure. Thus the fastball falls less than a ball thrown without spin (neglecting knuckleball effects) during the 60 feet 6 inches it travels to home plate.

On the other hand, a curveball, thrown with topspin, creates a higher pressure zone on top of the ball, which deflects the ball downward in flight. Instead of counteracting gravity, the curveball adds additional downward force, thereby giving the ball an exaggerated drop in flight.

==History==
Baseball lore has it that the curveball was invented in the early 1870s by Candy Cummings, though this claim is debatable. An early demonstration of the &quot;skewball&quot; or curveball occurred at the Capitoline Grounds in Brooklyn in August 1870 by Fred Goldsmith. In 1869, a reporter for the &quot;New York Clipper&quot; described Phonney Martin as an &quot;extremely hard pitcher to hit for the ball never comes in a straight line‚ but in a tantalizing curve.&quot; If the observation is true, this would pre-date Cummings and Goldsmith. In 1876, the first known collegiate baseball player to perfect the curveball was Clarence Emir Allen of Western Reserve College, now known as Case Western Reserve University, where he never lost a game. Both Allen and his teammate John P. Barden became famous for employing the curve in the late 1870s. In the early 1880s, Clinton Scollard (1860–1932), a pitcher from Hamilton College in New York, became famous for his curve ball and later earned fame as a prolific American poet. In 1885, &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, a children&#x27;s magazine, featured a story entitled, &quot;How Science Won the Game&quot;. It told of how a boy pitcher mastered the curveball to defeat the opposing batters.

The &quot;New York Clipper&quot; reported, of a September 26, 1863, game at Princeton University (then the College of New Jersey), that F. P. Henry&#x27;s &quot;slow pitching with a great twist to the ball achieved a victory over fast pitching.&quot; By 1866, many Princeton players were pitching and hitting &quot;curved balls&quot;.

Harvard President Charles Eliot was among those opposed to the curve, claiming it was a dishonest practice unworthy of Harvard students. At an athletics conference at Yale University in 1884 a speaker (thought to be from Harvard, likely Prof. Charles Eliot Norton, a cousin of the Harvard President) was reported to have stated: &quot;For the pitcher, instead of delivering the ball to the batter in an honest, straightforward way, that the latter may exert his strength to the best advantage in knocking it, now uses every effort to deceive him by curving—I think that is the word—the ball. And this is looked upon as the last triumph of athletic science and skill. I tell you it is time to call halt! when the boasted progress in athletics is in the direction of fraud and deceit.&quot;

In the past, major league pitchers Tommy Bridges, Bob Feller, Virgil Trucks, Herb Score, Camilo Pascual and Sandy Koufax were regarded as having outstanding curveballs.

<text>Roberta Williams&#x27; Laura Bow in The Dagger of Amon Ra (also known as Laura Bow II) is a computer game published by Sierra On-Line in 1992. The game is the second and final installment in &quot;The Laura Bow Mysteries&quot; line of adventure games, the first of which was &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot;. Unlike the first game, it was not written or designed by Roberta Williams, but she was a creative consultant on the project. It uses 8-bit color and a point-and-click interface. The CD-ROM version included voice acting. &quot;The Dagger of Amon Ra&quot; was developed using Sierra&#x27;s Creative Interpreter (SCI1.1). It is a spiritual sequel to the original game, contains the same elements and themes as the first, and is a much more traditional point-and-click game. It was re-released in 2017 on GOG.com with modern Windows support.

== Gameplay ==
The Laura Bow games were distinctive in that they required some actual logical detective work on the part of the player; for the most part, though, the puzzles were of the typical variety of inventory and environment interaction (and frequent, often unexpected, player character death) found in most Sierra adventures.

Gameplay uses a point-and-click interface featuring icons for different actions, similar to other Sierra games that were published during that time. An additional icon is used to ask characters a question about a topic listed in Laura&#x27;s notebook, which auto-populates with names, places and other subjects that she has previously heard or encountered.

The identity of the murderer is &quot;not&quot; automatically revealed at the end of the game. Instead, the player is asked a series of questions, ostensibly by the police, to prove that Laura had solved the crimes and discovered the secrets of the other suspects. If the questions are answered incorrectly, the coroner will give a hint to point the player towards the path that would have revealed the correct answer in subsequent playing of the games. The ending of the game can change depending on the answers given to the questions, most notably in that Laura can be killed if the player does not know the identity of the main murderer.

The game includes &quot;The Official Guide to the Leyendecker Museum&quot;, which also serves as the game&#x27;s manual. It features a map of the main level of the museum and a rough drawing of the lower level.

== Plot ==
The game is set in 1926, primarily in a museum, and reflects the Egyptology craze of the period. The protagonist is Laura Bow (a reference to Clara Bow), a Southern belle who has just graduated from Tulane University and moved to New York City, where she has landed a job at a prestigious newspaper, &quot;The New York Daily Register News Tribune&quot;. For her first assignment, she is asked to write a story on the theft of an artifact from the museum&#x27;s Egyptian exhibit. When a murder occurs during the party, however, she is locked inside with all of the other suspects. As other guests begin dying one by one, Laura must solve the numerous crimes occurring before the culprits escape or kill her.

The game features four different endings, depending if Laura gathers enough evidence to expose both O&#x27;Riley as the murderer and Watney as the thief. These endings include combinations of O&#x27;Riley going to prison or exacting revenge on Laura, Laura being asked on a date with Steve, Laura&#x27;s job status, and the fate of the dagger.

== Characters ==
* Laura Bow – after graduating from Tulane University, Laura Bow was hired as a reporter by a prestigious New York newspaper. Her first assignment is to investigate and report on the theft of the Dagger of Amon Ra, taking over from the reporter Crodfoller T. Rhubarb.
* Dr. Archibald Carrington III – formerly a curator of the British Museum, Dr. Carrington was appointed to become the new president of the Leyendecker Museum after the death of the previous president, Sterling Waldorf-Carlton. When the story begins, Archibald had worked at the museum for only a few weeks.
* Yvette Delacroix – the amorous French secretary of the Leyendecker Museum president. She has worked as a secretary under both Dr. Archibald Carrington, the current president, and Sterling Waldorf-Carlton, Dr. Carrington&#x27;s late predecessor. Years ago, Yvette worked as a call girl at a speakeasy. She has a deep sexual fondness for men and maintains relationships with several men at the same time including Ernie Leach and Detective Ryan O&#x27;Riley.
* Dr. Pippin Carter – an arrogant, self-important English archeologist, Dr. Carter was the one who discovered the Dagger of Amon Ra within a long-buried temple in Egypt. In the weeks before the story begins, he had been busy preparing the new Egyptology section for the Leyendecker museum. Dr. Carter is fastidiously attentive to his personal hygiene and appearance. He sometimes talks about, and compares himself to, his cousin, who is implied to be the famous archaeologist Howard Carter.
* Wolf Heimlich – as Chief of Security at the Leyendecker Museum, Wolf is obsessed with order and takes to his duties with an almost fanatical devotion. Dressed in a German military uniform, Wolf can often be found patrolling the museum grounds in a goosestep march. He also collects weapons of various types, keeping them in his office. Wolf is in a relationship with Dr. Olympia Myklos.
* Dr. Olympia Myklos – a native of Athens, Greece, Dr. Myklos is a curator at the Leyendecker Museum, specializing in paleontology. She has a morbid fascination with death and keeps exotic pet animals, including a ferret named Daisy and an Egyptian cobra named Barney.
* Ernie Leach – the custodian and handyman of the Leyendecker Museum. A hard-working, African American man, Ernie took employment at the museum to pay off his gambling debts to a loan shark.
* Ryan Hanrahan O&#x27;Riley – an Irish American detective in the NYPD, O&#x27;Riley is the detective assigned to investigate the theft of the Dagger of Amon Ra. He is the main antagonist of the game. He keeps fit every day and is fond of grapes.
* Steve Dorian – an art student, Steve Dorian works as a part-time dockworker to meet his financial needs. His name is a pun on the word &quot;stevedore&quot;.
* Dr. Ptahsheptut &quot;Tut&quot; Smith – a curator from the Egyptian Museum who is deeply opposed to Dr. Carter&#x27;s claim over the Dagger of Amon Ra. His arguments with Dr. Pippin Carter concerning the Dagger have almost come to blows at times.
* Lawrence &quot;Ziggy&quot; Ziegfeld – a small-time local criminal who sometimes works for the NYPD as an informant in exchange for leniency. He has many connections and resources within the criminal underworld and can often be found in one of New York&#x27;s many speakeasies. Due to his status as a &quot;stool pigeon&quot;, he is distrusted by criminals and police officers alike. Because of this, he is extremely paranoid and his face often twitches nervously.
* Rameses Najeer – an Egyptian accountant of the museum, he is opposed to Dr. Carter&#x27;s claim over the Dagger of Amon Ra. Rameses is a successful man who is married with one child and another on the way. He is proud of his Egyptian heritage despite the fact that he has lived in the United States for many years. Others describe him as a hard worker and a good family man, but he can be intense and passionate at times.
* Countess Lavinia Waldorf-Carlton – the widow of the previous museum president, Sterling Waldorf-Carlton. She is currently engaged in a legal battle concerning Sterling&#x27;s will and her entitlements as his spouse. Apparently, Sterling and Lavinia met during a trip on board an ocean liner about a year ago and married only a month or two later.
* Sam Augustini – the editor-in-chief of The New York Daily Register News Tribune, he is Laura&#x27;s boss and the one who hired her to write a story on the museum&#x27;s benefit party. He is close friends with Laura&#x27;s father, John Bow, who once saved the editor&#x27;s life.
* Crodfoller T. &quot;Rhub&quot; Rhubarb – Laura&#x27;s co-worker, he tries to help Laura whenever possible, but is also reluctant of Augustini&#x27;s decision to send Laura to write a report of the dagger&#x27;s theft when she is only just a rookie. If Laura fails to solve the murder mysteries and dagger theft, he would take over the case and solve them instead.
* Lo Fat – the jocular, Chinese American owner of Lo Fat&#x27;s Laundry, a Chinese laundry in New York City. Originally from Newark, New Jersey, Fat is a faithful patron of the Leyendecker Museum. Through his business, he has made acquaintances with many major contributors to the museum. Laura acquires the names of many of the supporting characters through Fat&#x27;s connections. Fat is also responsible for providing Laura with her distinctive evening dress for the museum party.
* Watney Little – a known English fugitive and con artist wanted by Scotland Yard. Reports indicate that he has recently escaped from Dartmoor Prison. The local police are still investigating the circumstances behind the escape.
* Henri Le Mort – the coroner who holds the inquest into the murders at the Leyendecker museum and the theft of the Dagger of Amon Ra. He asks Laura a variety of questions about the murders, the theft and other matters which may have a bearing on the case.
* Rocco – a taxi driver who shares interesting facts of the times, such as the first transatlantic radiotelephone call, while transporting Laura to various locations in the game.

== Reception ==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;Amon Ra&quot; was &quot;much improved over&quot; &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot;. The magazine criticized the &quot;slow and repetitive&quot; gameplay in the first two acts, and the possibility of unwinnable situations, but said that from Act 3 on &quot;the game is very difficult to set aside&quot;. It praised &quot;Amon Ra&quot; as a &quot;visual and aural treat&quot;, stating that its creators &quot;should be justifiably proud&quot;, approved of the game&#x27;s serious, realistic tone with &quot;a touch of humor&quot;, and called the use of a female protagonist &quot;refreshing&quot;. The magazine concluded that the game was &quot;another quality adventure from the fertile minds at Sierra&quot;. In April 1994 the magazine said that &quot;Amon Ra&quot; had a &quot;much more believable 1920s setting&quot; than its predecessor, and &quot;calls on the player&#x27;s attention to detail and deductive reasoning skills&quot;. The game received 4 out of 5 stars in &quot;Dragon&quot;. Cynthia E. Field of &quot;PC Games&quot; called &quot;Amon Ra&quot; &quot;a captivating whodunit&quot; and praised the game&#x27;s &quot;near-perfect blending of sound effects, music, and graphics&quot;.

In April 1994 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that the CD version&#x27;s &quot;hand-painted art, emotive stereo soundtrack, deep puzzles, and a convoluted storyline all combine to make this multimedia game a winner&quot;.

<doc id="640780" wikidata="Q5865452" url="?curid=640780" title="History of Materialism and Critique of Its Present Importance">
<text>History of Materialism and Critique of Its Present Importance () is a philosophical work by Friedrich Albert Lange, originally written in German and published in October 1865 (although the year of publication was given as 1866). Lange vastly extended the second edition published in two volumes in 1873–75. A three-volume English translation of the opus was published 1877–81.

==Contents==
Adopting the Kantian standpoint that we can know nothing but phenomena, Lange maintains that neither materialism nor any other metaphysical system has a valid claim to ultimate truth. For empirical phenomenal knowledge, however, which is all that humans can look for, materialism with its exact scientific methods has done most valuable service. Ideal metaphysics, though they fail of the inner truth of things, have a value as the embodiment of high aspirations, in the same way as poetry and religion. Lange replaced the transcendental subject of Kantianism by the organism, although he considered that this substitution validated all the more Kant&#x27;s philosophy that the subject apprehended the world through the categories of understanding.

Lange suggests that the methods for real science were present in Democritus&#x27;s atomistic materialism. However, atomistic materialism implies that the soul, like the body, is fated to be snuffed out: such a view made Democritus quite unattractive to virtually all world religions so Democritus was ignored and marginalized by the history of philosophy, in spite of being one of the greatest thinkers of the ancient Greek world.

Lange mentions Max Stirner&#x27;s book &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot; as &quot;the extremest that we know anywhere&quot;. He also mentioned Blanqui&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Eternité par les astres&quot;, which discussed the thesis of an Eternal Return.

Lange&#x27;s work exerted a profound influence on Friedrich Nietzsche, who aimed at radicalizing Lange&#x27;s viewpoint beyond Kant. At one time Nietzsche planned to write a dissertation on the notion of organism in Kant&#x27;s philosophy (letter to Paul Deussen). He also envisioned sending a work on Democritus, a major focus of Lange, to Deussen.

<doc id="640782" wikidata="Q6128503" url="?curid=640782" title="James Alexander (lawyer)">
<text>James Alexander (May 27, 1691 – April 2, 1756) was a Scottish-born lawyer and politician in colonial New York. He served in the Colonial Assembly and as attorney general of the colony in 1721–23. His son William was later a major general in the Continental Army during the American revolution. Alexandria Township, New Jersey was named after James Alexander.

==Early life==
Alexander was born in Muthill in Perthshire, Scotland on May 27, 1691, to David Alexander (&quot;of Muthil&quot;). He was a distant relation of the Earl of Stirling and may have received his formal education at the High School of Stirling.

He joined the navy, serving on HMS &quot;Arundell&quot; in 1712–13, where he learned navigation, mathematics, and astronomy. But in 1714–15, he joined the uprising in support of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, and fled to America in 1715 when it failed.

==Life in America==
In November 1715, he was appointed surveyor general of New Jersey. He personally made surveys, using instruments he had brought from Scotland and resolved disputed titles. Alexander settled in New York, married, and in January 1721 was appointed deputy-secretary of New York.

===Legal career===
Alexander read law in New York and was admitted to the provincial bar of New Jersey in 1720. He served as attorney general for the colony of New York from 1721 to 1723. Alexander sought membership of Gray&#x27;s Inn on February 1, 1725, and returned from London with a large legal library that enabled him to cite legal precedent in court. This was a distinct advantage for a colonial lawyer. James Duane, ward and later son-in-law of Robert Livingston, third Lord of Livingston Manor, read law as a clerk in Alexander&#x27;s office and became proficient in the area of rights and jurisdiction in land disputes. Alexander practiced law, engaged in mercantile pursuits, and built a considerable fortune.

He built a large brick mansion at Broad and Beaver Streets. Alexander owned six slaves over the course of his life, all of whom worked as domestic servants in his Broad Street mansion. One of his slaves escaped from bondage by forging a transit pass.

===Family landholdings===
William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling also known as Sir William Alexander was James Alexander&#x27;s ancestor. In 1621 King James I granted Stirling a royal charter appointing him mayor of a vast territory which was enlarged into a lordship and barony of Nova Scotia (meaning New Scotland); the area is now known as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and parts of the northern United States. On 22 April 1636, King Charles told the Plymouth Colony, which had laid claim to Long Island but had not settled it, to give the island to Alexander. In October 1641 the first Earl of Stirling deeded the island of Nantucket to Thomas Mayhew of Watertown, Massachusetts.

James Alexander never laid claim to the title Earl of Stirling. He fled Britain as a young man, after his role in a failed Jacobite plot to put James “the Old Pretender” on the British throne. Through his own industry he acquired what became Island Beach State Park in New Jersey and later lost it. His son William Alexander, Lord Stirling, unofficially known as Lord Stirling during his life and a Patriot general during the Revolutionary War, legally sought ownership of the property in 1761 and won the rights to what became Stirling Island. James Alexander also owned large tracts of land in today&#x27;s Basking Ridge area of New Jersey, which he later willed to his son.

===Politics===
In 1721, Alexander was appointed to the Governor&#x27;s Council in New York. In 1723, he was added to the Council in New Jersey and that same year made Attorney General of New Jersey. He frequently opposed the policies of New York Governor William Cosby and in 1732, Cosby succeeded in having Alexander removed from the council. In 1733, Alexander started an anti-Cosby newspaper, the &quot;New York Weekly Journal&quot;, with Peter Zenger as publisher. Alexander was the principal author of pieces critical of Governor Cosby. The following year, Zenger was arrested on sedition charges, but eventually a jury acquitted Zenger of libel in one of the first instances of jury nullification. Alexander and William Smith served as Zenger&#x27;s attorneys until both were disbarred after they challenged the commissions of the judges hearing the case.

In 1730, Alexander was chairman of the committee to revise the New York City charter; he was given the freedom of the city the following year. When Lord De La Warr was appointed governor in 1737, Alexander was reinstated to the bar and reappointed to the governor&#x27;s Council of New York. His removal from the Council of New Jersey was disregarded. Alexander became a vocal proponent of the emerging Whig political views, and engaged in various civic efforts as well. In 1751, he raised funds to establish King&#x27;s College.

===Later life===
Although he remained active in politics, his legal practice, acquired holdings, and other interests eventually absorbed most of his time and energy, and his political involvement waned. He was an founding member of the American Philosophical Society, established in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin and others, including Francis Hopkinson, John Bartram, Philip Syng, Jr.

==Personal life==

On June 5, 1721, Alexander married the wealthy widow Mary Spratt Provoost (1693–1760). She was the daughter of John Spratt (c. 1650–1697) and Maria de Peyster (1659–1700). Her DePuyster uncles drafted the prenuptial agreements. Mary was the widow of Samuel Provoost (d. 1719), the younger brother of David Proovost, the 24th mayor of New York City, with whom she had three children. Together, James and Mary had seven children:

* Mary Alexander II (1721–1767), who married Peter Van Brugh Livingston (1710–1792), the son of Philip Livingston and brother of Governor William Livingston, in 1739.
* James Alexander (1723–1731), who died young.
* William Alexander (1725–1783), who married Sarah Livingston (1725–1805), a daughter of Philip Livingston, in 1748. 
* Elizabeth Alexander (1726–1800), who married John Stevens (1715–1792), the Vice President of the New Jersey Legislative Council.
* Catherine Alexander (1727–1801), who married Walter Rutherfurd (1723–1804), who was born in Edgerston, Scotland, in 1758.
* Anna Alexander (1731–1736), who died young.
* Susannah Alexander (1737–1777), who married John Reid (1721–1807), a British army General and founder of the chair of music at the University of Edinburgh.

In 1756, while on a trip to Albany to confer with other Whig leaders, he suffered a flare up of his gout which led to a deterioration of his health. He returned home ill as a result and died in Albany or New York City on April 2, 1756.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Mary, he was the grandfather of 12 grandchildren, including Philip Peter Livingston (1740–1810).

Through his son William, he was the grandfather of three, William Alexander, Mary Alexander, who married a wealthy merchant named Robert Watts of New York, and Catherine Alexander, who married Congressman William Duer (1747–1799).

Through his daughter Elizabeth, he was the grandfather of John Stevens III (1749–1838), a lawyer, engineer, and inventor who constructed the first U.S. steam locomotive and first steam-powered ferry, and Mary Stevens (d. 1814), who married Chancellor Robert Livingston, negotiator of the Louisiana Purchase.

Through his daughter Catherine, he was the grandfather of John Rutherfurd (1760–1840), a Federalist member of the United States Senate from New Jersey who served from 1791 to 1798, who married Helena Magdalena Morris (1762–1840), daughter of Congressman Lewis Morris of Morrisania.

<text>Space Ghost is a superhero created by Hanna-Barbera Productions in the 1960s for TV network CBS. He was designed by Alex Toth.

In his original incarnation, he was a superhero who, with his teen sidekicks, Jan and Jace, and Blip the monkey, fought supervillains in outer space. In the 1990s, Space Ghost was brought back as a host for his own fictional late-night talk show, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, on Cartoon Network, Adult Swim and GameTap. In the 2000s, he was revamped as a serious superhero once again in a mini-series by DC Comics.

==Television series==
===&quot;Space Ghost and Dino Boy&quot;===

The original series debuted in September 1966. Space Ghost was voiced by Gary Owens, who is best known as the announcer for &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

In the original series, Space Ghost was an intergalactic crime fighter from the Ghost Planet. He had the ability to become invisible (referred to as &quot;Inviso Power&quot;) via his belt, fly, and survive in space. His principal weapons were his power bands which generated beam-based attacks including heat, cold, magnetism, energy, and force among others. Space Ghost&#x27;s sidekicks are Jan (voiced by Ginny Tyler), Jace (voiced by Tim Matheson), and their pet monkey Blip (vocal effects provided by Don Messick).

Space Ghost would fight such recurring supervillains as:

* Zorak (voiced by Don Messick) - A villain from a race of insectoids called Dokarians from the planet Dokar.
* Lizard Slavers - A race of reptilian humanoids that capture humans and sell them as slaves.
* Black Widow (voiced by Ginny Tyler) - A spider-themed villain who controls the Tarantopods and other insects. She was later renamed Spider Woman.
* Creature King (voiced by Vic Perrin in the first two appearances, Don Messick in later appearances) - An alien who uses a mind-control helmet to control different intergalactic animals.
* Metallus (voiced by Ted Cassidy) - A mechanical alien.
* Brak (voiced by Keye Luke) - A feline alien and space pirate.
* Moltar (voiced by Regis Cordic) - The creator of the Magma Men.

The original series shared time with an unrelated segment called &quot;Dino Boy in the Lost Valley&quot;. During its original run, there were a total of 42 Space Ghost episodes and 18 Dino Boy episodes. The series ended in 1968, but remained in syndication during the 1970s.

The final episodes had Metallus, Creature King, Zorak, Moltar, Brak, and Black Widow coming together as the Council of Doom to destroy Space Ghost. They were defeated by Space Ghost and were assumed to have escaped when their headquarters was destroyed.

===&quot;Space Stars&quot;===
Twenty-two new &quot;Space Ghost&quot; segments appeared on &quot;Space Stars&quot; on NBC in 1981. Gary Owens reprised his role as Space Ghost, while Steve J. Spears voiced Jace, Alexandra Stoddart voiced Jan, and Frank Welker provided the vocal effects of Blip. The episodes introduced a new assortment of villains including an evil version of Space Ghost named Space Spectre (voiced by John Stephenson) who came from an alternate universe. The villains Toymaker and Wizard (voiced by Frank Welker) made more than one appearance. As in the original series, Space Ghost often came to the aid of The Herculoids and vice versa. The Phantom Cruiser was given a more modern redesign as well. They also frequently crossed paths with the Teen Force and it appeared that Jan and Teen Force member Kid Comet were dating as well.

===&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;===

The character Space Ghost hosted a talk show, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, which began broadcasting in 1994 on Cartoon Network. The show spoofed late-night talk shows, with villains Zorak and Moltar serving as Space Ghost&#x27;s sidekicks with occasional guest appearances from other &quot;Space Ghost&quot; villains Metallus, Lokar, Tansut, Brak, and Black Widow. In this version, Space Ghost is voiced by George Lowe and his real name is Tad Ghostal. The show reused animation cels from the Hanna-Barbera archives.

The show ran from 1994 to 1999, and returned with two new episodes in 2001, moving to the Adult Swim programming block later that year; the series ended its Adult Swim run in 2004. The characters of Jan, Jace, and Blip (Space Ghost&#x27;s old sidekicks) appeared a few times on the show. After eight seasons on television, the show went into hiatus. New episodes of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; appeared on the &quot;Animation&quot; channel of the GameTap service, beginning on May 30, 2006. On May 31, 2008, the show ended when the TV section of GameTap shut down.

===&quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;===
Following the popularity of &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, the show provided a spin-off series, &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;; the show ran from 1995 to 1998. &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; was an hour-long cartoon block hosted by Space Ghost with his imprisoned sidekicks Zorak and Brak. The segments in-between the cartoons usually consisted of skits and original songs.

Due to the popularity of the series&#x27; songs, two albums were released: &quot;Space Ghost&#x27;s Surf &amp; Turf&quot; and &quot;Space Ghost&#x27;s Musical Bar-B-Que&quot;. Lowe provided the voice for Space Ghost on both records.

===Other appearances===

<text>Brandon Mayfield (born July 15, 1966) is an American Muslim based in Washington County, Oregon, who was detained in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings on the basis of a faulty fingerprint match. On May 6, 2004, the FBI arrested Mayfield as a material witness in connection with the Madrid attacks, and held him for two weeks, before releasing him with a public apology following Spanish authorities identifying another suspect. A United States DOJ internal review later acknowledged serious errors in the FBI investigation. Ensuing lawsuits resulted in a $2 million settlement. An initial ruling declared some provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act unconstitutional, but the United States government appealed, and the ruling was overturned at the Ninth Circuit level on technical standing grounds.

Mayfield&#x27;s case has been referenced in numerous scientific, political, and social journals.

==Early life and career==
Brandon Mayfield was born in Coos Bay, Oregon, and grew up in Halstead, Kansas. He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1985 to 1989, and then as an officer in the Army in Bitburg, Germany, from 1992 to 1994. He met his wife Mona, an Egyptian national and the daughter of a college professor, on a blind date in Olympia, Washington, in 1986, and converted to Islam shortly afterwards. They have lived in Beaverton, Oregon, off and on since 1989. Although he was a regular worshiper at a Beaverton mosque prior to his arrest, some of his colleagues were unaware of his religious beliefs. The imam of the mosque has described Mayfield as &quot;very patriotic.&quot; The Mayfields have four children.

He studied law at Washburn University and Lewis &amp; Clark College, receiving his Juris Doctor degree from Washburn University School of Law in 1999, and practicing family law in Newport before moving to the Portland area. Mayfield performed work for the Modest Means Program of the Oregon State Bar, which matches attorneys who are willing to work at reduced rates for low-income clients. In 2003, he offered child custody legal aid to Jeffrey Leon Battle, one of the Portland Seven, a group of people convicted of trying to travel to Afghanistan to help the Taliban.

== False accusation in 2004 bombing ==
=== Arrest and detention ===
Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings, fingerprints on a bag containing detonating devices were found by Spanish authorities. The Spanish National Police shared the fingerprints with the FBI through Interpol. Twenty possible matches for one of the fingerprints were found in the FBI database and one of the possible matches was Brandon Mayfield. His prints were in the FBI database as they were taken as part of standard procedure when he joined the military. He became the prime suspect because of his conversion to Islam and because he had represented one of the Portland Seven, despite those being first-amendment protected activities.

The FBI concluded that the fingerprints were a &quot;100 percent match&quot; on March 20, 2004. According to the court documents in the Honorable Judge Ann Aiken&#x27;s decision, this information was largely &quot;fabricated and concocted by the FBI and DOJ.&quot; The FBI finally sent Mayfield&#x27;s fingerprints to the Spanish authorities on April 2, but in an April 13 memo, the Spanish authorities contested the matching of the fingerprints from Brandon Mayfield to the ones associated with the Madrid bombing. Further, the Spanish authorities informed the FBI they had other suspects in the case, Moroccan immigrants not linked to anyone in the US. The FBI continued surveillance of Mayfield and his family despite the information received from the Spanish authorities, and misrepresented to a secret FISA court that the Spanish authorities had simply ruled Mayfield&#x27;s match &quot;inconclusive&quot; when in fact they had deemed it &quot;negative.&quot;

Mayfield was concerned for the safety of his children and wife, and according to his father, he suspected that he was under surveillance by the federal authorities. In the weeks before his arrest, Mayfield&#x27;s family was under the impression that their house had been broken into at least twice, although nothing was stolen. According to court documents, the FBI used national security letters in order to wiretap his phones, bug his house, and search his house several times, including collective personal hygiene products to test for DNA.

As was discovered during the court case, the FBI&#x27;s records show that this fingerprint, despite the sworn testimony of FBI and DOJ agents, was not an exact match but only one of 20 prints &quot;similar&quot; to the ones retrieved from Madrid. Based on that list of people with &quot;similar prints&quot; the FBI launched an extensive investigation of all 20 individuals using letters of national security (needs citation). The investigation included medical records, financial records, employment records, etc. on all 20 people and their families. It was during this investigation that Brandon Mayfield&#x27;s name rose to the top of the list.

On May 6, the FBI arrested Mayfield at his office in Beaverton, a suburb of Portland. The arrest was similar to the contemporary Mike Hawash case, under a material witness warrant rather than under charge; he was held with no access to family and limited access, if any, to legal counsel. The FBI initially refused to inform either Mayfield or his family why he was being detained or where he was being held. His family found out the extent of the allegations by watching the news, learning that someone had leaked the nature of the FBI investigation to the Associated Press, precipitating the rushed arrest.

He was at first held at a Multnomah County jail under a false name; he was later transferred to an unidentified location. His family protested that Mayfield had no connection with the bombings, his passport was expired, he was at home on the day of the attack, and had not been off the continent in over 11 to 14 years.

=== Release ===
Before his arrest, Spanish authorities informed the FBI in a letter dated April 13, 2004, that they reviewed the fingerprint on the bag as a negative match of Mayfield&#x27;s fingerprint, though this letter was not communicated to Mayfield&#x27;s attorneys. On May 19 the Spanish authorities announced that the fingerprints actually belonged to an Algerian national, Ouhnane Daoud; Brandon Mayfield was released from prison when the international press broke the story the next day—May 20, 2004. A gag order remained in force for the next few days. By May 25, the case was dismissed by the judge.

The FBI conducted an internal review of Mayfield&#x27;s arrest and detention, concluding that although he was not arrested solely due to his religious beliefs, they may have contributed to investigator&#x27;s failure to take into account the Spanish concerns over fingerprint identification. The FBI issued a press release announcing the report&#x27;s conclusion that they had not misused the USA PATRIOT Act in the investigation. Civil libertarians and the ACLU nonetheless consider Mayfield&#x27;s detention a misuse of the material witness statute.

The FBI later admitted wrongdoing and apologized for their acts. In response, on October 4, 2004, Mayfield filed a lawsuit over this invasion of his privacy. He sought an injunction to force the government to return or destroy copies of items seized from his home and challenged the law which was used against him as unconstitutional. The Federal Government filed several motions to have Mayfield&#x27;s case dismissed as a matter of national security, or national secrets, but these were denied on July 28, 2005, by Judge Ann Aiken.

=== Court&#x27;s ruling and aftermath ===
The case was heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Among the issues on appeal was whether materials removed from Mayfield&#x27;s house, including DNA samples taken from his family&#x27;s personal toothbrushes, were to be destroyed or preserved. The Federal Government assumed the position that materials must be preserved so that they can be referred to, if more lawsuits are brought in the future.

On November 29, 2006, the U.S. government settled part of the lawsuit with Mayfield for a reported $2 million. The government issued a formal apology to Mayfield as part of the settlement. The settlement allowed Mayfield to pursue a legal challenge against the Patriot Act. The FBI investigated itself and found no wrongdoing.

On September 26, 2007, two provisions of the Patriot Act were declared unconstitutional by the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. Finding in Mayfield&#x27;s favor, Judge Aiken ruled that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, &quot;now permits the executive branch of government to conduct surveillance and searches of American citizens without satisfying the probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment,&quot; which violates the Constitution of the United States. The Federal government appealed that ruling, and Mayfield&#x27;s attorney, Elden Rosenthal, argued in front of the Ninth Circuit court on February 5, 2009. The ruling was overturned in December 2009 on the ground that the Court found the plaintiff, Mayfield, not to have standing. Mayfield appealed this decision to the Supreme Court, but was denied &quot;certiorari&quot; on November 1, 2010.

== Subsequent work ==
Between 2015 and 2017, Mayfield participated in a campaign with CAIR, the ACLU, and the National Lawyers Guild to press for the Portland City Council to sever ties with the Joint Terrorism Task Force, citing surveillance and immigration issues.

In 2018 Brandon Mayfield represented Yonas Fikre before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, successfully persuading the court that damages done to the man by his placement on the No Fly List and interference with his attempts to return to the United States gave him standing to challenge the unconstitutionality of the policy.

<text>Carlos Silva (born April 23, 1979) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies (–), Minnesota Twins (–), Seattle Mariners (–), and Chicago Cubs ().

==Professional career==

===Philadelphia Phillies===
Silva signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1996. He made his Major League debut in 2002, pitching the entire season out of the bullpen. Silva appeared in 68 games for the Phillies, going 5-0 with a 3.21 ERA and 41 strikeouts. In 2003, he went 3-1 despite an ERA of 4.43 in 62 games and 1 start.

===Minnesota Twins===
In December 2003, the Twins acquired Silva from Philadelphia along with Nick Punto and Bobby Korecky in exchange for Eric Milton, who had been a staple of the Minnesota rotation since 1998.

With the Twins, Silva made a successful conversion from reliever to starter, in one of the biggest surprises in the 2004 season. He posted a 14–8 mark in 203 innings pitched and finished second in the rotation behind Cy Young winner Johan Santana. In 2005, he induced more double plays (34) than any other pitcher in the majors. In 2005, he set the record for fewest walks allowed per 9 innings in the modern era with an average of .43 BB/9 innings. On May 20, 2005, Silva set a record since 1957 for the fewest pitches thrown (74) in a nine-inning complete game.

In May 2006, Silva was demoted to the bullpen after struggling through the beginning of the season. In June, he re-entered the rotation when the struggling #5 starter, Scott Baker, was demoted to the Twins&#x27; Triple-A team in Rochester. He gave up a major-league-worst 1.90 home runs per 9 innings, giving up 38—more than any other major league pitcher, and had a major-league-worst batting average against of .326. In 2006, Silva gave up 38 home runs and allowed only 32 walks. In the previous season, he gave up 25 homers and just 9 walks. These two seasons make up only 15 full all-time seasons in which a pitcher qualifies for the ERA title while giving up more home runs than walks.

Through 2006, Silva posted a 42–32 record with 306 strikeouts and a 4.35 ERA in 743 innings.
In 2007, Silva started as the fifth starter behind Johan Santana, Boof Bonser, Ramón Ortiz, and Sidney Ponson. In his final season with the Twins, Silva finished 13-14 in 33 starts with a career high 89 strikeouts.

Silva allowed Frank Thomas&#x27;s 500th career home run on June 28, 2007, at the Metrodome.

===Seattle Mariners===
On December 20, 2007, Silva signed a four-year contract with the Seattle Mariners believed to be somewhere between $44 million and $48 million.

In his first full season as a Mariner, Silva posted the worst ERA for a full-time starter in 2008 with a 6.46 ERA in 28 starts. He also spent time on the DL with a sore elbow. He finished 4-15 as he managed to win just one game after the month of April.

Fresh off the WBC, Silva started the 2009 season slower than expected, with very little control over his pitches, and a high ERA. He sat out most of the season with a shoulder injury. Silva returned at near the end of the season for 2 appearances in relief, giving up one run in 0.2 innings to the Yankees on September 19 and one run on September 25 in Toronto in one inning.

===Chicago Cubs===
On December 18, 2009, Silva was traded along with $9 million to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Milton Bradley. Silva appeared to have turned his career around early in 2010, becoming the first Cubs starter since 1967 to begin a season with an 8–0 record. Despite fighting a stomach virus on June 7, he held the Pittsburgh Pirates to one run over seven innings, picking up his eighth win of the year in a 6–1 triumph. It was the best start by any Cub pitcher since Ken Holtzman began the 1967 season with nine straight wins. However, his success was very limited for the remainder of the season, and he was cut from the Cubs towards the end of spring training in 2011.

===New York Yankees===

On April 9, 2011, the New York Yankees signed Silva to a minor league deal. He was released on July 2.

===Boston Red Sox===
On January 3, 2012, Silva signed a minor league deal with the Boston Red Sox. He was released on March 17.

==Pitching style==
Silva threw a low 90s sinking fastball, a slider, a changeup, and a splitter. He was known for his relatively quick pace, taking very short breaks between pitches.

==Personal life==
Silva resides in Medina, Minnesota, with his wife Maria Hermann, son Justin, born June 12, 2007, and daughter Gabriella, born September 8, 2008. A Bowman rookie card of him from 2001 listed his weight at . His Topps card from 10 years later listed him at .

<doc id="640796" wikidata="Q5387110" url="?curid=640796" title="Eric Milton">
<text>Eric Robert Milton (born August 4, 1975) is an American former Major League Baseball left-handed starting pitcher who played for several teams between 1998 and 2009, and is currently the head coach at Severna Park High School.

==Amateur career==
A native of State College, Pennsylvania, Milton graduated from Bellefonte Area High School in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania and attended the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1996 while at Maryland, Milton played collegiate summer baseball for the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). A league all-star, he held opponents to a .105 batting average and set a league record with his microscopic 0.21 ERA. In 2004, Milton was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.

==Major league career==

===Minnesota Twins===
Milton was selected by the New York Yankees in the 1st round (20th pick) of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft; he was drafted as a compensation pick from the California Angels for the signing of Randy Velarde. He played one season in the Yankees minor league system. The New York Yankees traded Milton, Cristian Guzmán, Brian Buchanan, and Danny Mota to the Minnesota Twins for Chuck Knoblauch on February 6, 1998.

He made his Major League debut on April 5, 1998, for the Twins against the Kansas City Royals, working six scoreless innings to pick up the victory. He was 8–14 in his debut season with a 5.64 ERA in 32 starts.

On September 11, 1999, he struck out 13 batters in pitching a 7–0 no-hitter against the Anaheim Angels, the fifth no-hitter in Twins history. He finished the season with an ERA a full run lower than in his previous season, lowering it to 4.49 in 34 starts. He also completed 5 games with 2 shutouts.

In 2000, Milton went 13–10 in 33 starts. He led the team in wins.

In 2001, Milton enjoyed the best season of his career, going 15–7 with a career low 4.32 ERA and pitching in a career high 220 innings.

In 2002, Milton made just 29 starts due to injury. He walked a career low 30 batters, he finished the season 13–9 with a 4.84 ERA in a career low 171 innings. He was limited to 3 starts in 2003 due to a knee injury.

With Minnesota, Milton had a record of 57–51, with 715 strikeouts and a 4.76 ERA, and was selected to the 2001 AL All-Star team. He went 1–0 with a 1.65 ERA with the Twins in the 2002 and 2003 playoffs, and was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Carlos Silva and infielder Nick Punto following the 2003 season.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
Milton led the Phillies in wins, starts and strikeouts in 2004, going 14–6 with a 4.75 ERA and 171 strikeouts in 34 starts. He took a no-hitter into the 9th inning on July 25 against the Cubs but lost it before recording an out.

===Cincinnati Reds===
At the end of the 2004 season, he signed a three-year, $25 million contract as a free agent with Cincinnati. His record in 2005 with Cincinnati was 8–15 with a 6.47 ERA, one of the worst ERA&#x27;s for a full-time starter in NL history. The following season, Milton lowered his ERA to 5.19 despite giving up 29 home runs in 26 starts. He finished 8–8 in just 26 starts after missing 3 weeks to repair a torn cartilage in his left knee.

After lingering elbow problems in 2007, Milton underwent Tommy John surgery after just 4 starts, ending his season.

Due to his poor performance and high contract, NPR of Minnesota called him a bust, ESPN named him to their all-overpaid team, and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named him as the only pitcher on their all bust team, noting he gave up one home run per 11.9 batters.

===New York Yankees===
He left the Reds as a free agent after the 2007 season and went unsigned due to his injury history until signing a minor league deal with the New York Yankees on July 11, 2008. He never pitched for any of the Yankees minor league teams during 2008 however and was shortly released.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Milton signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 10, 2009 with an invitation to spring training. He did not make the Major League team and was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes to open the season. In 7 starts with the Isotopes, Milton was 3–2 with a 2.83 ERA. His contract was purchased by the Dodgers on May 14 and on May 16, Milton made his first appearance in the Major leagues since 2007 when he started for the Dodgers against the Florida Marlins.

On May 26, Milton made his second start of the season for the Dodgers against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. He worked five innings in the Dodgers 7–1 victory, recording his first Major League win since September 12, 2006. He made a total of five starts for the Dodgers, with a 2–1 record and a 3.80 ERA.

His season ended when he underwent surgery to remove a herniated disk on July 14.

==Coaching==
Milton joined the Maryland Terrapins baseball program in September 2011 as an assistant coach. On June 28, 2012, Milton was named the interim head coach of the Terrapins after head coach Erik Bakich left to take the head coaching position at the University of Michigan.

Eric was named Head Coach of the Severna Park High School Baseball team in 2013. He coached his oldest son, Kody during the 2015 - 2018 seasons, coming close to winning the State Championship during his son&#x27;s senior season 

One of the players he coached was Jackson Merrill during his time at Severna Park High School. Merrill made his debut with the San Diego Padres in 2024.

<text>Ajen Yohl Mat also known as Aj Neʼ Ohl Mat, Ac Kan and Ahl Lawal Mat, (died August 8, 612) was an ajaw of the Maya city-state of Palenque. He acceded to the throne on January 1, 605 and ruled until his death. He was probably the son of Yohl Ikʼnal or Sak Kʼukʼ and the brother of Janahb Pakal or Kʼinich Janaab Pakal I. During his reign, his kingdom was invaded on April 4, 611 by Scroll Serpent, ruler of the Kaan kingdom (Calakmul).
