<text>Santa Maria della Vittoria (, ) is a Catholic titular minor basilica and Discalced Carmelite conventual church dedicated to Our Lady of Victories in Rome, Italy, famously the home of Gian Lorenzo Bernini‘s masterpiece the &quot;Ecstasy of Saint Teresa&quot;. The church is in the Rione Sallustiano, on number 98 via XX Settembre, where this street intersects with Largo Santa Susanna. It is located next to the Fountain of Moses and mirrors the Church of Santa Susanna across the Largo. It is about two blocks northwest of the Piazza della Repubblica and Teatro dell&#x27;Opera metro station.

==History==
The land for the church was purchased on April 20, 1607, and the church was built from 1608 to 1620 as a chapel dedicated to Saint Paul for the Discalced Carmelites. After the Catholic victory at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, which reversed the Reformation in Bohemia, the church was rededicated to the Virgin Mary. Ottoman standards captured at the 1683 Battle of Vienna were later hung in the church, reinforcing to the theme of the Virgin helping lead Catholic armies to victory.

The order itself funded the building work until the discovery of the Borghese Hermaphroditus in the excavations. Scipione Borghese, Cardinal-nephew of Pope Paul V, appropriated this sculpture but, in return, funded the rest of work on the façade and granted the order his architect, Giovanni Battista Soria. These grants only came into effect in 1624, and work was completed two years later.

==Exterior==
The church is the only structure entirely designed and completed by the early Baroque architect Carlo Maderno, though the interior suffered a fire in 1833 and required restoration. Its façade, however, was erected by Giovanni Battista Soria during Maderno&#x27;s lifetime, 1624–1626, showing the unmistakable influence of Maderno&#x27;s Santa Susanna nearby.

==Interior==

The interior of the church has a single wide nave under a low segmental vault, with three interconnecting side chapels behind arches separated by colossal Corinthian pilasters with gilded capitals that support an enriched entablature. Contrasting marble revetments are enriched with white and gilded stucco angels and putti in full relief. The interior was sequentially enriched after Maderno&#x27;s death; its vault was frescoed in 1675 with triumphant themes within shaped compartments with feigned frames: &quot;The Virgin Mary Triumphing over Heresy&quot; and &quot;Fall of the Rebel Angels&quot; executed by Giovanni Domenico Cerrini in 1675.

Other sculptural detail abounds: &quot;The Dream of Joseph&quot; (left transept, Domenico Guidi, flanked by relief panels by Pierre Etienne Monnot) and the funeral monument to Cardinal Berlinghiero Gessi. There are paintings by Guercino, Domenichino, and Nicolas Lorrain. The church is also the final resting place of Saint Victoria, whose preserved remains are on display inside.

===Cornaro Chapel===
The Cornaro Chapel is a private chapel commissioned by Federico Cornaro to Baroque sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Bernini lost papal patronage following the death of Pope Urban VIII and his replacement by Pope Innocent X, who disliked his artistic style, which enabled his commissioning by private patrons at this accomplished stage in his career. The entire architectural and sculptural ensemble of the chapel was designed by Bernini.

The altarpiece of the Cornaro Chapel, the &quot;Ecstasy of St. Teresa&quot;, is among the most celebrated works of all of Baroque sculpture, and widely considered one of Bernini&#x27;s masterpieces. The statues depict a moment as described by Saint Teresa of Avila in her autobiography, where she had the vivid vision of a Seraph piercing her heart with a golden shaft, causing her both immense joy and pain. The flowing robes and contorted posture abandon classical restraint and repose to depict a more passionate, almost voluptuous trance. Although artistically a &quot;tour de force&quot;, nonetheless, during Bernini&#x27;s lifetime and in the centuries following, the &quot;Ecstasy of St. Teresa&quot; was accused by diverse critics for crossing a line of decency by sexualizing the visual depiction of the saint&#x27;s experience, to a degree that no artist, before or after Bernini, dared to do: in depicting her at an impossibly young chronological age, as an idealized delicate beauty, in a semi-prostrate position with her mouth open and her legs splayed-apart, her wimple coming undone, with prominently displayed bare feet (Discalced Carmelites, for modesty, always wore sandals with heavy stockings) and with the seraph &quot;undressing&quot; her by (unnecessarily) parting her mantle to penetrate her heart with his arrow.

<text>Richard Dawson Kiel (September 13, 1939 – September 10, 2014) was an American actor. Standing 2 m 17 cm (7 ft 1½ in) tall and often referred to as &quot;the Gentle Giant&quot;, he was known for portraying Jaws in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) and &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979). Kiel&#x27;s next-most-recognized role is the tough but eloquent Mr. Larson in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996). Other notable films include &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (1974), &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978), &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), &quot;Pale Rider&quot; (1985), and &quot;Tangled&quot; (2010). On television, he portrayed the giant alien in the highly regarded 1962 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, &quot;To Serve Man&quot;.

==Early life==
Kiel was born on September 13, 1939, in Detroit, Michigan. His extraordinary height was a result of gigantism, a condition caused by an excess of human growth hormone. When he was 9 years old, his family moved to Los Angeles County, California, where Kiel graduated from Baldwin Park High School.

Before becoming an actor, Kiel worked in several jobs, including as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, a nightclub bouncer, and as a cemetery plot salesman. From 1963 to 1965, Kiel worked as a night-school mathematics instructor at the William B. Ogden Radio Operational School in Burbank, California.

==Career==
His career included movies, television guest starring, and co-authoring books.

===Television===
Kiel appeared in many television shows throughout the 1960s to the 1980s, including the famous 1962 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, &quot;To Serve Man&quot;, where he portrayed the 9-foot (3-m) tall Kanamit aliens. Other TV series he appeared in included &quot;Laramie&quot; (&quot;Street of Hate&quot;, 1961), &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (&quot;The Decision&quot;, 1961), &quot;Honey West&quot;, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;The Monkees&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;.
Due to his size, Kiel was often cast in villainous roles. He appeared as Voltaire, the towering mute-but-lethal assistant to Dr. Miguelito Loveless in three first-season episodes of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. In the &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; episode &quot;The Vulcan Affair&quot; (1964), Kiel appeared as a guard in Vulcan&#x27;s plant and portrayed Merry in &quot;The Hong Kong Shilling Affair&quot;. In 1967, he played a monster in &quot;The Monkees&quot; episode &quot;I Was a Teenage Monster&quot;.

He later appeared in an episode of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, titled &quot;The Night of the Simian Terror&quot;, as Dimas, the outcast son of a wealthy family, banished because of birth defects that distorted his body and apparently affected his mind. The episode first aired February 16, 1968. This episode is significant, because it allowed Kiel the opportunity to really act rather than just look intimidating.

In 1977, Kiel and Arnold Schwarzenegger were both considered for playing the Hulk in the American television series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. After Schwarzenegger was turned down due to his height, Kiel started filming the pilot. However, the producers quickly decided they wanted a more muscular Hulk rather than the towering Kiel, so he was dismissed. Kiel later said he did not mind losing the part, because he could only see out of one eye. He reacted badly to the contact lenses he had to wear for the role. He also found the green makeup unpleasant and difficult to remove. His scenes were then reshot with Lou Ferrigno.

===Film===
Kiel broke into films in the early 1960s with &quot;Eegah&quot; (1962), which was later featured on &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot; and &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, as were &quot;The Phantom Planet&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Human Duplicators&quot; (1965). He also produced, co-wrote, and starred in &quot;The Giant of Thunder Mountain&quot; (1991). He also had a brief non-speaking appearance leaving a gym in the Jerry Lewis movie &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963).

The James Bond film producers spotted Kiel in &quot;Barbary Coast&quot;, and thought he was ideal for the role of Jaws in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977). Jaws was one of the few Bond villains to appear in two Bond films, later appearing in &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979). He was often shot with his mouth closed or briefly showing his dangerous smile as he admitted the mouthpiece to simulate the metal teeth was extremely painful to wear and could only be used for a few minutes on every take. He reprised his role of Jaws in the video game called &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot;, supplying his voice and likeness. This was his second outing as a metal-toothed villain; a year before being cast in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, he had played Reace in the comedy-thriller film &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976). He used his size for comedic effect, as the &quot;best-dressed giant&quot; Mr. Eddie, in &quot;So Fine&quot; with Ryan O&#x27;Neal. Kiel also starred in the film &quot;Pale Rider&quot; (1985). Acting as the main antagonist&#x27;s henchman, he redeems his character&#x27;s status by saving the hero from a gunshot to the back.

&quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; was the first of three films that Kiel appeared in alongside Barbara Bach in the late 1970s. The other two were &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; and &quot;The Humanoid&quot;.

Although earlier roles had offered him little dialogue, his role in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996) was quite the opposite. As Mr. Larson, Happy Gilmore&#x27;s former employer, Kiel exchanges several one-liners with both Adam Sandler&#x27;s Happy and Christopher McDonald&#x27;s Shooter McGavin. Kiel took a quieter profile after &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;″s release, but left semi-retirement to record a role for &quot;Tangled&quot; (2010). In the acclaimed animated Disney film, he portrayed Vlad, a surprisingly softhearted thug who collects ceramic unicorns.

==Personal life and death==
Kiel&#x27;s first marriage was to Faye Daniels in 1960. They divorced in 1973. One year later he married Diane Rogers, who stood 2 ft 0.8 in (63 cm) shorter at 5 ft 1 in (154 cm) tall. Their marriage lasted for 40 years, until his death. They had four children and nine grandchildren. Despite being 2 ft 0.8 in (63 cm) taller than his second wife, she described their mutual attraction as &quot;We see eye to eye on so many things.&quot;

In 1992, Kiel suffered a severe head injury in a car accident, which affected his balance. Consequently, he had to rely on a cane for support, as seen in his appearance in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;. Later in life, Kiel utilized a scooter or wheelchair for mobility.

Kiel co-authored a biography of the abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay titled &quot;Kentucky Lion&quot;. In 2002, Kiel published his autobiography, &quot;Making It Big in the Movies&quot;. Kiel was also a born-again Christian. His website states his religious conversion helped him to overcome alcoholism.

On September 10, 2014, three days before his 75th birthday, Kiel died at St. Agnes Medical Center in Fresno, California, from heart disease.

<doc id="635041" wikidata="Q316997" url="?curid=635041" title="Anderson Cooper">
<text>Anderson Hays Cooper (born June 3, 1967) is an American broadcast journalist and political commentator who anchors the CNN news broadcast show &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;. In addition to his duties at CNN, Cooper serves as a correspondent for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, produced by CBS News. After graduating from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989, he began traveling the world, shooting footage of war-torn regions for Channel One News. Cooper was hired by ABC News as a correspondent in 1995, but he soon took more jobs throughout the network, working for a short time as a co-anchor, reality game show host, and fill-in morning talk show host.

In 2001, Cooper joined CNN, where he was given his own show, &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;; he has remained the show&#x27;s host since. He developed a reputation for his on-the-ground reporting of breaking news events, with his coverage of Hurricane Katrina causing his popularity to sharply increase. For his coverage of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Cooper received a National Order of Honour and Merit, the highest honor granted by the Haitian government. From September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as the host of his own syndicated television daytime talk show, &quot;Anderson Live&quot;.

Cooper has won 18 Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards, as well as an Edward Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club in 2011. A member of the Vanderbilt family, he came out as gay in 2012, becoming &quot;the most prominent gay journalist on American television&quot;. In 2016, Cooper became the first LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate, and he has received several GLAAD Media Awards.

==Early life and education==
Cooper was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger son of writer Wyatt Emory Cooper and artist Gloria Vanderbilt. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt family and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and Reginald&#x27;s patrilineal great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune. He has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus &quot;Stan&quot; Stokowski (b. 1950) and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria&#x27;s ten-year marriage to conductor Leopold Stokowski. In 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the southern United States.

Cooper&#x27;s media experience began early. As a baby, he was photographed by Diane Arbus for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. At the age of three, Cooper was a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on September 17, 1970, appearing with his mother. At the age of nine, he appeared on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; as an impostor. From age 10 to 13, Cooper modeled with Ford Models for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Macy&#x27;s.

Wyatt experienced a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery, and died January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. Cooper considers his father&#x27;s book &quot;Families&quot; to be &quot;sort of a guide on... how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.&quot;

When Cooper was 21, his older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, died by suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt&#x27;s New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son&#x27;s death in the book &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Story&quot;, in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug salbutamol. Carter&#x27;s suicide sparked Anderson&#x27;s interest in journalism:
Cooper attended the Dalton School, a private co-educational day school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a &quot;survival trip&quot;. He contracted malaria on the trip and was hospitalized in Kenya. Describing the experience, Cooper wrote &quot;Africa was a place to forget and be forgotten in.&quot; Cooper attended Yale University, where he resided in Trumbull College and was a coxswain on the lightweight rowing team. He was inducted into the Manuscript Society and majored in political science, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989.

==Career==
===Early career===
During college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science. He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education. He is a self-proclaimed &quot;news junkie since [he] was in utero&quot;.

===Channel One===
After Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States. Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government.

After reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi8 camera with him, Cooper began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. In 1992, he filmed stories from Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda.

After having been on such assignments for a couple of years, Cooper realized in 1994 that he had slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: &quot;I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it&#x27;s a dozen, it&#x27;s not so bad.&quot; One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:
===ABC===
In 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight &quot;World News Now&quot; program on September 21, 1999. In 2000, he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC&#x27;s reality show &quot;The Mole&quot;:
Cooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery. As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on &quot;Live&quot; when one of the two hosts cannot go in to work.

===CNN===

Cooper left &quot;The Mole&quot; after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, &quot;Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.&quot; His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on &quot;American Morning&quot;. In 2002, he became CNN&#x27;s weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve special from Times Square.

====&quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;====
On September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said:
In 2005, Cooper covered the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi.
In 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, &quot;Yeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it&#x27;s hard not to when you&#x27;re surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.&quot; A contributor to &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN&#x27;s Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN&#x27;s golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm.&quot;

In September 2005, the format of CNN&#x27;s &quot;NewsNight&quot; was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN&#x27;s U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper &quot;the anchorperson of the future&quot;. Following the addition of Cooper, the ratings for &quot;NewsNight&quot; increased significantly; Klein remarked that &quot;[Cooper&#x27;s] name has been on the tip of everyone&#x27;s tongue.&quot; To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper&#x27;s &quot;360°&quot; program would be expanded to two hours and shifted into the 10:00 pm ET slot formerly held by &quot;NewsNight&quot;, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room&quot; filling in Cooper&#x27;s former 7:00 pm ET slot. With &quot;no options&quot; left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having &quot;mutually agreed&quot; with Jonathan Klein on the matter.
In early 2007, Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million.

====&quot;The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper&quot;====
On April 16, 2023, CNN launched a new Sunday primetime series, &quot;The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.&quot;

====&quot;CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute&quot;====
In 2007, he began hosting &quot;CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute&quot;, a show about extraordinary deeds by ordinary people.

====&quot;Planet in Peril&quot; documentary====
In October 2007, Cooper began hosting the documentary &quot;Planet in Peril&quot; with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from &quot;National Geographic Explorer&quot; teamed up for a sequel, &quot;Planet in Peril: Battle Lines&quot;, which premiered in December 2008.

====Syndicated talk show: &quot;Anderson Live&quot;====
In September 2010, Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named &quot;Anderson&quot; (now titled &quot;Anderson Live&quot;). The show premiered on September 12, 2011, and as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;. On October 29, 2012, it was announced that &quot;Anderson Live&quot; would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final &quot;Anderson Live&quot; aired on May 30, 2013.

====2016 presidential debates====
Along with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This made him the first LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election.

====New Year&#x27;s Eve====
In 2017, Cooper&#x27;s close friend, Andy Cohen, joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve coverage. They again co-hosted CNN&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

===&quot;60 Minutes&quot;===

Cooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent.

=== Other work ===

==== AC2 ====
Andy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their conversational stage show &quot;AC2&quot; beginning in March 2015. The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta. The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, &quot;The Andy Cohen Diaries&quot;, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City. Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching more than fifty cities as of October 2018.

==== Broadway ====
Cooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe.

==== Writings ====
A freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including &quot;Details&quot; magazine.

In May 2006, Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, &quot;Dispatches from the Edge&quot;, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book&#x27;s proceeds are donated to charity. The book topped &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list on June 18, 2006.

In 2017, Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored &quot;The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss&quot;. Compiled from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt&#x27;s tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave &quot;nothing left unsaid&quot; between the pair. It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication.

==== &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; ====
From April 19 to 30, 2021 Cooper served as a guest host on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; following the death of Alex Trebek.

==== Podcast: &quot;All There Is&quot; ====

In 2022, Cooper launched a deeply personal podcast exploring grief and loss. On the show, he interviews other notable people on their experiences with grief. Guests have included TV host Stephen Colbert, musician Laurie Anderson and comedian Molly Shannon. The inspiration for the podcast came from his own life. Reflecting on the loss of his father when he was 10, the loss of his brother to suicide at 21, and the more recent loss of his mother Gloria Vanderbilt, he said &quot;What has struck me is the degree to which I had not dealt with this stuff at all.&quot; He shared that he wanted to explore this universal human experience. &quot;I just felt like, &#x27;Why am I so alone in this? This is something we all go through.&#x27; And this idea gave me great strength, that I&#x27;m on a road that has been traveled by everybody, in one form or another. Why every time somebody is going down this road should it feel like the first time?&quot;

Cooper won a 2023 Webby Award for Best Series for &quot;All There Is&quot;. His 5-word acceptance speech was &quot;All There Is, Is Love.&quot;

==Personal life==

As of 2016, Cooper was not registered to any political party.

While promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey he had dyslexia as a child.

Cooper played &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; with his brother as a child. He later said that it gave him and his brother an escape from the grief of their father&#x27;s death.

Cooper is gay; as of 2012, he was (according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;) &quot;the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television&quot;. For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews. On July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part:
In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook sought Cooper&#x27;s advice before making the decision to publicly come out as gay.

In 2014, Cooper and his long-term partner at the time, Benjamin Maisani, purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut. In March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and Maisani had split up.

Cooper was friends with Anthony Bourdain, celebrity chef and host of the CNN series &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;. After Bourdain died by suicide on June 8, 2018, Cooper paid tribute to him in a CNN special program, &quot;Remembering Anthony Bourdain&quot;. Cooper also paid tribute to Bourdain on the Thanksgiving 2020 episode of &quot;Anderson Cooper Full Circle&quot;, saying that he was &quot;proud to call Anthony Bourdain a friend&quot;, and adding: &quot;He is so, so missed by so many.&quot;

In 2021, Cooper and co-author Katherine Howe published &quot;Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty&quot;, a history of the Vanderbilt family going back to his Vanderbilt ancestors who came to New Amsterdam in the 17th century.

===Children===
On April 30, 2020, Cooper announced the birth of his son Wyatt Morgan Cooper by a surrogate on April 27. &quot;On Monday I became a father. I&#x27;ve never said that out loud and it astonishes me. I have a son,&quot; he said at the end of a CNN Town Hall on his show, &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;. He also went on to make an announcement on Instagram, stating that &quot;Wyatt Morgan Cooper was born on Monday weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces.&quot;

Though Cooper and Benjamin Maisani are no longer romantically involved, the pair co-parent the child and Maisani was present in the delivery room for Wyatt&#x27;s birth. Wyatt is named after Cooper&#x27;s late father, Wyatt Cooper, and his middle name is derived from the Morgan side of his family, being the maiden name of his maternal grandmother Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt.

On February 10, 2022, Cooper announced at the beginning of his show on CNN that he had just become a father for a second time to a son named Sebastian Luke Maisani-Cooper. Maisani is in the process of adopting Cooper&#x27;s son Wyatt, after which Wyatt&#x27;s surname will become Maisani-Cooper.

==Awards==

Cooper helped lead CNN&#x27;s Peabody Award-winning coverage of Hurricane Katrina, and the network&#x27;s Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award-winning coverage of the 2004 tsunami. He has won 18 Emmy Awards, including two for his coverage of the earthquake in Haiti, and an Edward R. Murrow Award.

<text>Barker Fairley, (May 21, 1887 – October 11, 1986) was a British-Canadian painter, and scholar who made a significant contribution to the study of German literature, particularly for the work of Goethe, and was an early champion and friend of the Group of Seven.

==Life and work==
Although educated and brought up in a strong European tradition and background, Fairley&#x27;s important life&#x27;s scholarship in German literature and art criticism was done in Canada and was about Canadian art and Canadian culture. His perspective and writings strongly influenced a burgeoning academic and artistic culture in his new chosen home.

He was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire and died, a Canadian citizen, in his home in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

He was educated at Leeds, and in 1907 was granted a Ph.D. from Jena University in Germany. His first academic appointment was at Jena. Between 1910 and 1915, he joined the faculty at the newly founded University of Alberta in Edmonton. He joined the University of Toronto&#x27;s German department in 1915 where he taught until the end of his career as a professor.

In 1949, he was invited to Bryn Mawr College to deliver lectures on the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but was barred entry by the U.S. Department of Justice. He later compiled the texts of the abortive lectures into six essays on &quot;Faust&quot;. He retired in 1957.

In 1978, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his &quot;unique contribution to Canadian scholarship&quot;.

Barker Fairley spent almost all of his professional artistic life in Ontario, where he was also mentor and teacher to Charles Meanwell and Vincent Thomas. Many of his paintings are still owned by the University of Toronto and are in the Art Museum, University of Toronto, Hart House collection. He began to paint in 1931 through the encouragement of Robert Finch. In his use of colour and form, the effect of the Group of Seven is quite evident. His critical approach and activism regarding the Group of Seven contributed to their acceptance in Canadian Art, and his scholarly influence over University College at the University of Toronto left a strong and lasting impression.

His first wife, Margaret Fairley, was a notable Canadian political activist. His daughter Ann (Fairley) Schabas was dean of the Faculty of Library and Information Science at the University of Toronto. Her husband is musician Ezra Schabas, former dean of the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. Barker Fairley&#x27;s grandchildren include academics William Schabas, Margaret Schabas, and lawyer Paul Schabas.

<text>Samuel Louis Warner (born Szmuel Wonsal, August 10, 1887 – October 5, 1927) was an American film producer who was the co-founder and chief executive officer of Warner Bros. He established the studio along with his brothers Harry, Albert, and Jack L. Warner. Sam Warner is credited with procuring the technology that enabled Warner Bros. to produce the film industry&#x27;s first feature-length talking picture, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. He died in 1927, on the day before the film&#x27;s enormously successful premiere.

== Early years ==

Samuel &quot;Wonsal&quot; or &quot;Wonskolaser&quot;, was born in the village of Krasnosielc, Poland (then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Empire). He was one of eleven children born to Benjamin, a shoe maker born in Krasnosielc, and Pearl Leah (née Eichelbaum), both Polish Jews. He had ten siblings. His sisters were Cecilia (1877–1881), Anna (1878–1958), Rose (1890–1955), Fannie (1891–1984) and Sadie (1895–1959). His brothers were Hirsz Mojżesz ((1881–1958), and later known as &quot;Harry&quot;), Abraham ((1884–1967), later known as &quot;Albert&quot; or &quot;Abe&quot;), Jacob ((1892–1978), later known as &quot;Jack&quot;), David (1893–1939) and Milton (1896–1915).

The family immigrated to Baltimore, Maryland in October 1889 on the steamship &quot;Hermann&quot; from Bremen, Germany. Their father had preceded them, immigrating to Baltimore in 1888, and following his trade in shoes and shoe repair. He changed the family name to Warner, which was used thereafter. As in many Jewish immigrant families, some of the children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names. Szmuel became Samuel, nicknamed Sam.

In Baltimore, Benjamin Warner struggled to make enough money to provide for his growing family. Following the advice of a friend, Benjamin relocated the family to Canada, where he attempted to make a living by bartering tin wares to trappers in exchange for furs. After two arduous years in Canada, Benjamin and his family returned to Baltimore. In 1896, the family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry Warner, who established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town. Benjamin worked with his son Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city&#x27;s downtown area. As a child, Warner found himself trying to find work through a range of various odd jobs.

==Career==

===Early business ventures===
Samuel Warner was the first member of his family to move into the entertainment industry. In the early 1900s, he formed a business partnership with another Youngstown resident and &quot;took over&quot; the city&#x27;s Old Grand Opera House, which he used as a venue for &quot;cheap vaudeville and photoplays&quot;. The venture failed after one summer. Warner then secured a job as a projectionist at Idora Park, a local amusement park. He persuaded the family of the new medium&#x27;s possibilities and negotiated the purchase of a Model B Kinetoscope from a projectionist who was &quot;down on his luck&quot;. The purchase price was $1,000. Warner&#x27;s interest in film came after seeing Thomas Edison&#x27;s &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; while working as an employee at Cedar Point Pleasure Resort in Sandusky, Ohio. During this time, Albert agreed to join Samuel and together the two displayed showings of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; at carnivals throughout the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania; Sam Warner would run the film projector and Albert would sell tickets.

In 1905, Harry Warner agreed to join his two brothers and sold his Youngstown bicycle shop. Through the money Harry made by selling the bicycle shop, the three brothers were now able to purchase a building in New Castle, Pennsylvania; The brothers named their new theater The Cascade Movie Palace. The Cascade Movie Palace was so successful that the brothers were able to purchase a second theater in New Castle. This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907. That year, the Warner brothers established the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement Company, and the three brothers rented an office in the Bakewell building in downtown Pittsburgh. Harry then sent Sam Warner to New York to purchase, and ship, films for their Pittsburgh exchange company, while he and Albert remained in Pittsburgh to run the business.

Their business, however, proved lucrative until the advent of Thomas Edison&#x27;s Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees. In 1909, the brothers sold the Cascade Theater for $40,000, and decided to open a second film exchange in Norfolk, Virginia; through this Norfolk company, younger brother Jacob (known as &quot;Jack,&quot;) following Sam&#x27;s advice, officially joined his three brothers&#x27; business and was sent to Norfolk by older brother Harry to serve as Warner&#x27;s assistant. In 1910, the Warners would sell the family business, to the General Film Company, for &quot;$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000&quot;.

===Formation of Warner Bros.===
In 1910, the Warner brothers pooled their resources and moved into film production. After they sold their business, the brothers lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle&#x27;s Independent Moving Pictures Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust; the brothers served as distributors for Laemmle&#x27;s films in Pittsburgh. In 1912, Sam would help the brothers earn a $1,500 profit with his film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;. In the wake of this success, Harry Warner, seeing Edison&#x27;s monopoly threat grow, decided to break with Laemmle and had the brothers start their own film production company, Warner Features. After this occurred, Harry Warner, who now had an office in New York with brother Albert, sent Sam and Jack to establish film exchanges in Los Angeles and San Francisco; Sam would run the company&#x27;s Los Angeles division while Jack ran the company&#x27;s San Francisco division. The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market. Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for My Four Years in Germany, a bestselling semi autobiographical account by Ambassador James W. Gerard that condemned German wartime atrocities. Profits from the success of &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot; gave the four brothers the opportunity to establish a studio in the area near Hollywood. In the new Hollywood studio, Warner became co-head of production along with his younger brother, Jack. In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and storylines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.

Between 1919 and 1920, the studio was not profitable. During this time, banker Motley H. Flint—who, unlike most bankers at the time, was not antisemitic— helped the Warners pay off their debts. The brothers then decided to relocate their production studio from Culver City to Sunset Boulevard. The studio would also rebound in 1921, after the success of the studio&#x27;s film &quot;Why Girls Leave Home&quot;. With the film&#x27;s success, director Harry Rapf was appointed the studio&#x27;s new head producer. On April 4, 1923, following the studio&#x27;s successful film &quot;Where the North Begins&quot;, Warner Brothers, Inc. was officially established.

One of the new company&#x27;s first big stars would be the dog Rin Tin Tin. By directing Rin Tin Tin, newcomer director Daryl Zanuck&#x27;s career would be greatly advanced. In addition to Rin Tin Tin, the studio was also able to gain more success with German film director Ernst Lubitsch, whose first film with the studio, &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot;, reached the New York Times Ten Best Films List of 1924. The film was also the studio&#x27;s most financially successful film of the year and helped establish Lubitsch as the studio&#x27;s top director. The Warners were also able to add another film to the New York Times Ten Best Films List with &quot;Beau Brummel&quot;. Despite the studio&#x27;s success, the Warners were unable to compete with Paramount, Universal, and First National (The Big Three), and were soon threatened to be bought out by the end of 1924.

During this time, Harry Warner would provide more relief for the studio after he was able to purchase Brooklyn&#x27;s Vitagraph Studios. In 1925, Sam Warner had also acquired a radio station, KFWB. After acquiring the radio station, Sam decided to make an attempt to use synchronized sound in future Warner Bros. Pictures. After a visit to Western Electric&#x27;s Bell Laboratories headquarters, Sam Warner urged his brother, Harry, to sign an agreement with Western Electric to develop a series of &quot;talking&quot; shorts using the newly upgraded sound-on-film technology, a sound-on-disc system for motion pictures. Harry Warner, however, objected to using synchronized sound in the studio&#x27;s films.

By February 1926, the studio had suffered a net loss of $333,413. Harry Warner ultimately agreed to use synchronized sound in Warner Bros. shorts if it was used only for background music. Harry Warner then made a visit to Western Electric&#x27;s Bell Laboratories in New York and was impressed. One problem confronting the Warners though was that the high-ups at Western Electric were antisemitic. Sam Warner, however, was able to convince the high-ups to sign with the studio after his wife Lina, who was not Jewish, wore a gold cross at a dinner they attended with the Western Electric brass. Harry Warner then signed a partnership agreement with Western Electric to use Bell Laboratories to test the sound-on-film process. Warner and younger brother Jack then decided to take a big step forward and make &quot;Don Juan&quot;.

In May 1926, through the company&#x27;s partnership with Western Electric, Sam formed a subsidiary known as Vitaphone. Through Vitaphone, the studio released a series of musical shorts and the feature-length &quot;Don Juan&quot; (which had a synchronized music track); upon establishing Vitaphone, Sam was also made Vice President of Warner Bros. Despite the money &quot;Don Juan&quot; was able to draw at the box office, it still could not match the expensive budget the brothers put into the film&#x27;s production. These vehicles received further tepid responses, and Harry grew increasingly opposed to the venture.

Around this time, Paramount head Adolph Zukor offered Sam a deal as an executive producer for his studio if he brought Vitaphone with him; during the year, Harry had also become the company president. Sam Warner, not wanting to take any more of brother Harry&#x27;s refusal to move forward with using sound in future Warner films, agreed to accept Zukor&#x27;s offer, but the deal between them died after Paramount lost money in the wake of Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s death. By April 1927, First National, Paramount, MGM, Universal, and Cecil B. De Mille&#x27;s Producers Distributing (the Big Five studios) had put the Warners in financial ruin. Western Electric renewed the Warner-Vitaphone contract on the term that Western Electric was no longer exclusive, allowing other film companies to test sound. Harry Warner eventually agreed to accept Sam&#x27;s demands. The Warner brothers pushed ahead with &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, a new Vitaphone feature based on a Broadway play and starring Al Jolson. &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; broke box-office records, establishing Warner Bros. as a major player in Hollywood and single-handedly launching the talkie revolution.

==Personal life==
In 1925, after years of bachelorhood, Warner met eighteen-year-old &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; performer and actress Lina Basquette while spending time in New York visiting the Bell Laboratories. The two began an intense love affair. On July 4, 1925, the two were married. While Warner&#x27;s younger brother Jack did not object to Basquette&#x27;s Catholicism, the rest of the Warner family did. They refused to accept Basquette and did not acknowledge her as a member of the Warner clan. On October 6, 1926, the couple&#x27;s only child, daughter Lita, was born.

After Sam Warner&#x27;s death in 1927, brother Harry asked Lina Basquette to give up custody of the couple&#x27;s daughter Lita. Harry Warner claimed he was concerned that little Lita would be raised as Catholic instead of Jewish (according to Basquette, she and Sam Warner agreed to raise any female children they had as Catholic and any male children as Jewish). Harry Warner and his wife offered Lina Basquette large amounts of money to relinquish custody of her daughter but she refused. She finally relented after Harry Warner promised her that Lita would receive a $300,000 trust fund ($ million today), with Harry Warner and his wife awarded legal custody of Lita on March 30, 1930. Basquette quickly regretted her decision and attempted to regain custody of her daughter. Basquette, however, was never financially stable enough to do so as the Warner family launched several legal suits against her to win back Sam Warner&#x27;s share of Warner Bros. studio. She would only see Lita on two occasions over the next twenty years: in 1935, when Harry Warner and his family moved to Los Angeles, and when Lita married Dr. Nathan Hiatt in 1947. Basquette and her daughter reconnected in 1977 when Basquette backed a lawsuit that Lita brought against her uncle Jack Warner&#x27;s estate.

==Death==
In September 1927, Jack—who was working nonstop with Sam on production of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;—noticed that his brother started having severe headaches and nosebleeds. By the end of the month, Sam was unable to walk straight. He was hospitalized and was diagnosed with a sinus infection that was aggravated by several abscessed teeth. Doctors also discovered that Warner had developed a mastoid infection of the brain. After four surgeries to remove the infection, Warner slipped into a coma. He died of pneumonia caused by sinusitis, osteomyelitis and epidural and subdural abscesses on October 5, 1927, the day before the premiere of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.

According to &quot;Hollywood Be Thy Name&quot;, the 1993 memoir of Jack Warner, Jr., and Cass Warner Sperling, character actor William Demarest claimed that Sam Warner was murdered by his own brothers. This allegation, leveled in 1977, was never corroborated, and Demarest&#x27;s reliability was questioned because of his long dependence on alcohol; the last time that Sam would meet with his entire family was at his parents&#x27; wedding anniversary in 1926.

Crowds of movie stars gathered at the Bresse Brothers funeral parlor to attend Warner&#x27;s funeral. A private memorial service was then held in the Warner Bros. studio on October 9, 1927. He is interred in the Warner family mausoleum at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California.

As the family grieved over Warner&#x27;s sudden death, the success of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; helped establish Warner Bros. as a major studio. While Warner Bros. invested only $500,000 in the film, the studio reaped $3 million in profits. Hollywood&#x27;s five major studios, which controlled most of the nation&#x27;s movie theaters, initially attempted to block the growth of &quot;talking pictures&quot;. In the face of such organized opposition, Warner Bros. produced twelve &quot;talkies&quot; in 1928 alone. The following year, the newly formed Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences recognized Warner Bros. for &quot;revolutionizing the industry with sound&quot;.

== Legacy ==
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Sam Warner has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6201 Hollywood Boulevard.

A gymnasium was donated by the Warner Brothers family to the Hebrew Orphan Asylum (HOA) of the City of New York on September 30, 1928, in memory of Sam L. Warner and Milton Warner. The HOA was located between 136th to 138th street, fronting Amsterdam Ave, in Hamilton Heights. The HOA was in operation on that site from 1884 to 1941. The buildings were then leased from the City - to the City College of New York (CCNY), in collaboration with the War Department, as a dormitory for returning veterans. The former Main Building was named &quot;Army Hall&quot; and the former Reception House was named &quot;Finley Hall,&quot; Warner Gym kept its name. In 1952, the Board of Education built P.S. 192 as a connection to Warner Gym. CCNY traded the HOA property for a public park known as Jasper Oval (on Convent Ave), moving out in 1955. The HOA buildings, with the exception of Warner Gym, were demolished in 1956 to make way for the Jacob H. Schiff Park. Warner Gym can still be seen on 138th Street, close to Hamilton Place. An entrance vestibule just inside the side gate has a memorial stone from the Warner Family.

<text>Newport () is a town, community, electoral ward and ancient port of &quot;Parrog&quot;, on the Pembrokeshire coast in West Wales at the mouth of the River Nevern () in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. The town gives its name to Newport Bay.

A popular tourist destination, Newport town straddles the Fishguard to Cardigan (A487) road, while the old port area hosts beach, water and other activities.

== History ==
The town was founded by the Norman William FitzMartin (c. 1155 – 1209) in about 1197. He was a son-in-law of the Lord Rhys, who nevertheless expelled him from his former base at nearby Nevern, which had been established by his father Robert fitz Martin. William founded Newport as the new capital of the Marcher Lordship of Cemais and it was a busy port founded primarily on the growing medieval wool trade. Despite seizure from the native Welsh, it remained within the FitzMartin family until the death of William, the 2nd Lord Martin, who died without a male heir in 1326.
Newport Castle, built by FitzMartin, is situated on a spur of Carn Ingli which overlooks Newport and much of the surrounding countryside. Though in ruins since at least the 17th century, it is impressive due to its situation; a house incorporating the castle walls, which faces west over the town, the bay and the Irish Sea, is still inhabited.

In the town is a significant mediaeval pottery kiln from the 15th century, believed to be the only intact example in Britain; finds include jugs, pots, ridge tiles and distilling equipment. Excavation was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2017.

Newport appears prominently on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire, and is a former marcher borough. George Owen of Henllys, in 1603, described it as one of five Pembrokeshire boroughs overseen by a portreeve. It retains some of the borough customs such as electing a mayor, who beats the bounds on horseback every August.

In the 1880s the castle was associated with John Brett, who rented it for his large family while he spent summers cruising the south and west coasts of Wales painting, sketching and photographing. He moored his 210-ton schooner, &quot;Viking&quot; (which had a crew of twelve) at Parrog. A lifeboat station (now a private residence) was operated from a beach known as The Cwm to the west of Parrog in the early 20th century.

==Governance==
At the local level, the electorate of the community elects up to eleven town councillors to Newport Town Council, who meet monthly.

Newport is also an electoral ward to Pembrokeshire County Council, electing one county councillor. Like many wards in the county, Newport has been represented by Independent councillors with no party affiliation.

==Areas==
===Town===
Newport town has a compact but varied shopping centre with most facilities including a post office, a wide range of retail premises and ancient buildings including the castle (not open to the public), which is undergoing restoration work.

===Parrog===

The old port area contains much of historic interest, including some of the old quay walls and two former lime kilns. There are moorings for small craft and a number of holiday lets and eating places. It is possible, with caution, to cross the river on foot at low tide. Parrog has two beaches, a golf course, a windsurfing and dinghy sailing club, pubs, hotels and camping grounds.

==Listed buildings==
In the community, there are more than 60 listed buildings.

==Amenities==
===Worship===

The church of St Mary&#x27;s, situated below the castle though within the town, dates from the FitzMartin era, and the outside east apse bears their arms (&quot;Argent, two bars gules&quot;). It is a Grade II* listed building. The church was the subject of an 1860 photograph by notable early Welsh photographer John Thomas (1838–1905).

Other religious buildings include Bethlehem Chapel and the Tabernacle Chapel.

===Hostelries===

The town&#x27;s hostelries include Llwyngwair Arms in the centre of town and Cnapan Hotel, a Georgian hotel and restaurant.

===Sailing===
Newport Sailing Club is housed in an old warehouse. As well as facilities for members, it has a non-members&#x27; bar.

===Walking===
Newport is on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, part of the Wales Coast Path, has a youth hostel and is popular for walks in the Preseli Hills. Carn Ingli hill, an Iron Age hillfort with Bronze Age hut circles, lies just outside the town. Nearby are the Carreg Coetan Arthur burial chamber and the West Wales Eco Centre.

A little to the north of Newport lie Newport Cliffs, a Site of Special Scientific Interest managed by Natural Resources Wales.

<text>Lactuca, commonly known as lettuce, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The genus includes at least 50 species, distributed worldwide, but mainly in temperate Eurasia.

Its best-known representative is the garden lettuce (&quot;Lactuca sativa&quot;), with its many varieties. &quot;Wild lettuce&quot; commonly refers to the wild-growing relatives of common garden lettuce. Many species are common weeds. &quot;Lactuca&quot; species are diverse and take a wide variety of forms. They are annuals, biennials, perennials, or shrubs. Their flower heads have yellow, blue, or white ray florets. Some species are bitter-tasting.

Most wild lettuces are xerophytes, adapted to dry habitat types. Some occur in more moist areas, such as the mountains of central Africa.

<text>The Opera Comique was a 19th-century theatre constructed in Westminster, London, located between Wych Street, Holywell Street and the Strand. It opened in 1870 and was demolished in 1902, to make way for the construction of the Aldwych and Kingsway.

The theatre was built cheaply as a speculative venture, and was known as one of the &quot;rickety twins&quot; along with the adjacent Globe Theatre. Numerous managements presented plays in English, French and German, and the house was also used for extravaganzas and English versions of French opéras bouffes. It is best remembered as the theatre where several early Gilbert and Sullivan operas had their first runs, between 1877 and 1881.

==History==
===Background and early years===
In the 16th century Lyon&#x27;s Inn, one of the Inns of Chancery attached to London&#x27;s Inner Temple, stood on the site. By the 1860s the area had deteriorated greatly, and the old inn had been converted into what the historians Mander and Mitchenson describe as &quot;dwellings of a dubious nature&quot;. In 1864 part of the area was cleared, and the impresario Sefton Parry built a new theatre, the Globe, which opened in 1868. He acquired an adjacent site, bounded by Wych Street, Holywell Street and the Strand, on which he built the Opera Comique two years later. The architect was Francis Fowler.

Parry&#x27;s construction of the theatres was a speculative venture: he hoped to make large profits from compensation when the area was demolished, which was even then in contemplation. It remained in contemplation for more than thirty years. The two theatres, which backed on to each other, became known as &quot;the rickety twins&quot;: both were of such flimsy construction that performers could hear each other through the common wall. Despite the nickname, the Opera Comique was by no means a twin of the Globe, being only about half the size, with a seating capacity of 862, compared with more than 1,500 at the Globe.

Another way in which the two theatres differed was that, unlike the Globe, the Opera Comique was largely underground. It was entered through tunnels from three streets (including the Strand) and was nicknamed the &quot;Theatre Royal Tunnels&quot;. It was reportedly draughty, and its long flight of stairs leading down to the level of the stalls was a dangerous fire hazard. Despite this and the flimsy construction, the theatre attracted high praise from the press after it opened. &quot;The Era&quot;, commented, &quot;For elegance of design and perfect adaptability to the requirements of dramatic art it is not surpassed, if indeed it be equalled, by any existing Theatre&quot;. Another London journal reported:
:We are almost inclined to pronounce it &quot;the&quot; prettiest theatre in London. It is in the flat horse-shoe form, the stage being well within sight and hearing of every part of the auditorium. This comprises rows of comfortable and elegant stalls on the floor, with three tiers or circles extending nearly round the house as dress-circle, family-circle, and amphitheatre, respectively, and six private boxes on either side of the stage. The design of construction reflects the highest credit on Mr F. H. Fowler, the architect, and the chaste and elegant decorations of Mr K. W. Bradwell deserve great praise.

The theatre opened under the name &quot;Royal Opera Comique&quot; on 29 October 1870. A company from the Théâtre Déjazet in Paris, led by the veteran actress Virginie Déjazet, presented Victorien Sardou&#x27;s comedy &quot;Les Prés Saint-Gervais&quot; and two shorter pieces, to an audience that included the Prince of Wales. The following year, French drama continued, when the Comédie-Française company made its first appearance outside France, an event that caused considerable interest.
The first home-grown production at the theatre was a musical play in 1871, &quot;Marie&quot;, with music by Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte and a libretto by E. Spencer Mott. This accompanied an English adaptation of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Médecin malgré lui&quot;. The production was not a success. Opéras bouffes by Hervé, Offenbach and Lecocq, and extravaganzas by F. C. Burnand followed. After short seasons starring the Italian tragedienne Adelaide Ristori and then the English operetta star Emily Soldene, Carte became manager of the theatre in 1874, and presented &quot;The Broken Branch&quot;, an English version of Gaston Serpette&#x27;s operetta &quot;La branch cassée&quot;, starring Pauline Rita. Carte&#x27;s first attempt to found &quot;a permanent abode for Light Opera&quot; failed, and the theatre passed into other hands for the next three years.

The word &quot;Royal&quot; was dropped from the name of the theatre in 1876. Burnand and Charles Morton were both briefly managers there, presenting extravaganzas and comic operas respectively. Morton&#x27;s season in 1876 included well-received productions of Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Madame l&#x27;archiduc&quot; and Lecocq&#x27;s &quot;La fille de Madame Angot&quot;, featuring Soldene and Kate Santley and, in the second piece, W. S. Penley, promoted from the chorus. Morton also presented a successful double bill of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; and Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Geneviève de Brabant&quot;. After Morton a succession of managements between May 1876 and September 1877 staged productions that made little impact.

===Gilbert and Sullivan===

In November 1877 the Comedy Opera Company, managed by Carte, took on the lease and staged the premiere of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. This was followed in 1878 by the same team&#x27;s &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, which became a hit, running for 571 performances, the second-longest theatrical run in history, to that date. During the performance on 31 July 1879, Carte&#x27;s former business partners in the Comedy Opera Company (with whom Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan had split) tried to seize the set, creating a celebrated fracas. Over Christmas 1878, during the run of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, the theatre was renovated and redecorated by E. W. Bradwell, reopening on 1 February 1879. &quot;The Era&quot; commented, &quot;We can hardly overpraise the beauty and grace of the Opera Comique as it now appears to the delighted audience.&quot;

Two more Gilbert and Sullivan successes followed, now produced by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company: &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1880) and, finally, &quot;Patience&quot; (1881), which was later transferred to Carte&#x27;s new and larger theatre, the Savoy. During this period, Carte also presented various companion pieces with the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the 1877 revival of &quot;Dora&#x27;s Dream&quot; by Arthur Cecil and Alfred Cellier; &quot;The Spectre Knight&quot; (1878); revivals of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;; several pieces by George Grossmith beginning in 1878: &quot;Beauties on the Beach&quot;, &quot;A Silver Wedding&quot;, &quot;Five Hamlets&quot;, and &quot;Cups and Saucers&quot;; revivals of Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;After All!&quot;; a &quot;Children&#x27;s Pinafore&quot; with an entirely juvenile cast (1878); &quot;In the Sulks&quot; (1880); and &quot;Uncle Samuel&quot; (1881).

===Later years===
Once D&#x27;Oyly Carte left the Opera Comique the theatre&#x27;s fortunes declined. It was unoccupied from October to the end of 1881. At the start of 1882, John Hollingshead and Richard Barker presented &quot;Mother-in-Law&quot;, a frivolous comedy by George R. Sims, which ran in a double bill with a burlesque called &quot;Vulcan&quot;, until May. They were followed by a spoof called &quot;The Wreck of the Pinafore&quot; by H. Lingard and Luscombe Searelle, described by &quot;The Era&quot; as &quot;curious and impudent&quot;, which ran until October. During the rest of the 1880s a succession of managements presented a wide range of genres, from adaptations of French plays, Shakespeare, Sheridan, Ibsen, and a Dickens adaptation by the novelist&#x27;s son, to musical shows, including &quot;The Fay o&#x27; Fire&quot; by Edward Jones and Henry Herman, which &quot;The Era&quot; later described as &quot;notable as introducing Miss Marie Tempest to the regular stage&quot;. Composers whose works were presented at the Opera Comique in this period included Julia Woolf, Meyer Lutz and Victor Roger. Performers included Nelly Bromley, Frank Wyatt, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Julia Gwynne and Penley.
The theatre was again renovated in 1885, under the proprietorship of the actor-manager, David James. &quot;The Era&quot; thought that the refurbishments made it &quot;one of the most convenient, handsome, and acceptable places of entertainment in London&quot;. James had bought adjoining premises in Holywell Street to make room for an extension to the theatre. The bars and circulation areas were, according to &quot;The Era&quot;, much improved, a spacious smoking room was added, and new emergency exits were installed. In 1891, George Edwardes took on the management of the theatre and presented a burlesque of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; by Adrian Ross, J. L. Shine and Frank Osmond Carr, with a cast including Arthur Roberts and Marion Hood. It was well received and ran from January to September. After that, the theatre reverted to its pattern of rapidly changing productions and short-lived managements.

A feature of the early 1890s was the frequent presentation of adaptations from, or original works by, novelists such as Henry James, Rudyard Kipling and George Moore. A further season of French plays, performed in their original language, was followed by a German season, also given in the original, in 1894, which ran for more than two months. In early 1895, &quot;Nellie Farren started her unfortunate season here with a bad comedy … and a worse burlesque&quot;, according to &quot;The Era&quot;. Later that year Augustus Harris presented Charles Villiers Stanford&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Shamus O&#x27;Brien&quot;, which ran for two months, from March to May. Osmond Carr&#x27;s &quot;The Maid of Athens&quot;, ran for a month in June 1897, after which, said &quot;The Era&quot;, &quot;nothing worthy of any record whatever has been attempted at this temple of the drama, which has had a singularly eccentric and mostly disastrous career.&quot; A revival of a musical adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, with music by Walter Slaughter, opened for the Christmas season of 1898 and ran until mid-February 1899. In March 1899, Horace Sedger announced a burlesque for the Opera Comique, &quot;Great Caesar&quot;, by Paul and Walter Rubens and George Grossmith Jr., but he changed his plans and presented it at the Comedy Theatre.

The Opera Comique closed in 1899 and was compulsorily purchased by the London County Council for £40,000. It was demolished in 1902 when the area was redeveloped to create Aldwych (named after old Wych Street) and Kingsway.

<text>Lois Cleveland Chiles (born April 15, 1947) is an American actress and former fashion model known for her role as Holly Goodhead in the James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), and as a hit-and-run driver in &quot;Creepshow 2&quot; (1987).

Other screen credits include &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973), &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974), &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978), &quot;Broadcast News&quot; (1987), and the television role of Holly Harwood on &quot;Dallas&quot; (1982–1983).

==Early and personal life==
Chiles was born in Houston, the daughter of Marion Clay Chiles and Barbara Wayne Kirkland Chiles. Her paternal uncle was oil tycoon and Texas Rangers owner Eddie Chiles. She had two brothers: Clay Kirkland Chiles (died 1979), and William Edmonds Chiles, president and CEO of Bristow Group, Inc. She was raised in Alice, Texas.

Chiles studied at the University of Texas at Austin and the former Finch College in New York City, where she was discovered by a &quot;Glamour&quot; editor looking for a young woman to feature on the cover of the magazine&#x27;s annual college issue. She landed the job and soon had contracts with Wilhelmina Models in New York and Elite Models in Paris. Later, she studied acting under Roy London. She dated Don Henley but the relationship ended, and in 2005, she married money manager Richard Gilder. They are both honorary co-chairs of Northfield Mount Hermon, a school in Massachusetts. Gilder donated money to the school and they named the Chiles Theater after her. Gilder died in 2020.

==Career==
Chiles enjoyed a successful modeling career in the early 1970s. After her role in the independent 1972 blaxploitation film &quot;Together for Days&quot; opposite Clifton Davis, Chiles appeared in the successful 1973 studio release &quot;The Way We Were&quot;, as the college girlfriend of Robert Redford. She was then cast as Jordan Baker in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974) alongside Mia Farrow and, once again, Robert Redford. She again shared the screen with Farrow in the Agatha Christie adaptation &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978).

As NASA astronaut, scientist, and Bond girl Dr. Holly Goodhead, Chiles appeared opposite Roger Moore in &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979).

Chiles had initially been approached to star in the previous Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, but she declined the role as she was taking a break from acting at the time. She also appeared in a small role in the thriller &quot;Coma&quot; (1978), one of the many films in which she played a murder victim.

She appeared in the music video for the Tony Powers song &quot;Odyssey&quot; in 1982.

Chiles lost her youngest brother to non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in 1979, which contributed to her decision to take a three-year hiatus from acting. The time away took a toll on her film career, and she struggled to find roles of the caliber she previously enjoyed, although film critic Pauline Kael gave her good notices for her performances in Alan Alda&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot; (1986). Her portrayal of reporter Jennifer Mack in James L. Brooks&#x27; &quot;Broadcast News&quot; (1987) was also well received, as was her turn in George A. Romero&#x27;s horror flick &quot;Creepshow 2&quot; in 1987, as a hit-and-run driver. In 1989, she appeared uncredited in a short but effective cameo as the estranged mother of Ione Skye&#x27;s character in &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989).

She has since appeared as a stuffy high-school principal in the 1996 Disney film &quot;Wish Upon a Star&quot;, and as a frightened cruise passenger in the critically panned &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot; in 1997. She made a cameo appearance in the international release of the 1997 Bond spoof &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot;, though her scene was cut from the United States release.

She has worked in television, playing J.R. Ewing&#x27;s love interest Holly Harwood in the 1982–1983 season of &quot;Dallas&quot; and guest appearances in series such as &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (as a psychotic split-personality model), &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and &quot;The Nanny&quot; (with another Bond girl, Ivana Miličević). Later career high points included the indie films &quot;Diary of a Hitman&quot; (1991) and &quot;Curdled&quot; (1996). In 2005, friend Quentin Tarantino, with whom she had previously worked on the set of &quot;Curdled&quot;, recruited her to appear in the two-episode finale of season five of &quot;&quot;, which he wrote and directed.

In the spring of 2002, she taught a course in film acting at the University of Houston. Unlike some &quot;Bond girls&quot;, Chiles has said that &quot;being a Bond girl is a fun way to be remembered&quot;, although she jokes that being asked to sigh &quot;Oh, James&quot; is annoying because &quot;you can&#x27;t live up to people&#x27;s fantasies&quot;.

<text>The Preseli Mountains (, ; or ), also known as the Preseli Hills, or just the Preselis, is a range of hills in western Wales, mostly within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and entirely within the county of Pembrokeshire.

The range stretches from the proximity of Newport in the west to Crymych in the east, some in extent. The highest point at above sea level is Foel Cwmcerwyn. The ancient of track along the top of the range is known as the Golden Road.

The Preselis have a diverse ecosystem, many prehistoric sites, and are a popular tourist destination. There are scattered settlements and small villages; the uplands provide extensive unenclosed grazing, and the lower slopes are mainly enclosed pasture.

Slate quarrying was once an important industry. More recently, igneous rock is being extracted. The Preselis have Special Area of Conservation status, and there are three sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs).

==Name variations==
A peak is spelt &quot;Percelye&quot; on a 1578 parish map, and more recent maps show the range as Presely or Mynydd Prescelly. The etymology is unknown, but is likely to involve Welsh &quot;prys&quot;, meaning &quot;wood, bush, copse&quot;. A number of other peaks are shown on the 1578 map, but the only other named peak is &quot;Wrennyvaur&quot; (now Frenni Fawr). An 1819 Ordnance Survey Map refers to the range as Precelly Mountain (singular). An 1833 publication stated: &quot;the ancient Welsh name...is Preswylva, signifying &quot;a place of residence&quot;&quot;, but does not cite any evidence. 21st century maps show the range as &quot;Mynydd Preseli&quot;.

==Geology==

The hills are formed largely from the Ordovician age marine mudstones and siltstones of the Penmaen Dewi Shales and Aber Mawr Shale formations which have been intruded by microgabbro (otherwise known as dolerite or diabase) of Ordovician age. The former slate quarries at Rosebush on the southern edge of the hills worked the Aber Mawr Formation rocks whilst it is the dolerite tors of Carnmenyn which have been postulated, amongst other localities, as the source of the Stonehenge ‘bluestones’.

In contrast Foel Drygarn towards the eastern end of the range is formed from tuffs and lavas of the Fishguard Volcanic Group. Further east is Frenni Fawr which is formed from mudstones and sandstones of the Nantmel Mudstone Formation of late Ordovician Ashgill age. The sedimentary rocks dip generally northwards and are cut by numerous geological faults.
Cwm Gwaun is a major glacial meltwater channel which divides the northern tops such as Mynydd Carningli from the main mass of the hills.

==Geography==
The hills, much of which are unenclosed moorland or low-grade grazing with areas of bog, are surrounded by farmland and active or deserted farms. Field boundaries tend to be earth banks topped with fencing and stock-resistant plants such as gorse. Rosebush Reservoir, one of only two reservoirs in Pembrokeshire, supplies water to southern Pembrokeshire and is a brown trout fishery located on the southern slopes of the range near the village of Rosebush. To the south is Llys y Fran reservoir. There are no natural lakes in the hills, but a number of rivers, including the Gwaun, Nevern, Syfynwy and Tâf have their sources in the range.

===Peaks===
The principal peak at above sea level is Foel Cwmcerwyn. There are 14 other peaks over of which three exceed .

===Settlements===
Villages and other settlements within the range include Blaenffos, Brynberian, Crosswell, Crymych, Cwm Gwaun, Dinas Cross, Glandy Cross, Mynachlog-ddu, New Inn, Pentre Galar, Puncheston, Maenclochog, Rosebush and Tafarn-y-Bwlch. The only town in the Preseli area is Newport, at the foot of the Carningli-Dinas upland in the northwest of the range.

===Natural history and land use===
The Preselis provide hill grazing for much of the year and there is some forestry. As well as features of interest to geologists and archaeologists, the hills have a wide variety of bird, insect and plant life. There are three sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs): Carn Ingli and Waun Fawr (biological), and Cwm Dewi (geological). The Preseli transmitting station mast, erected in 1962, stands on Crugiau Dwy near the hamlet of Pentre Galar. To the south of Crugiau Dwy is the extensively quarried hill Carn Wen (Garnwen Quarry) which was still actively extracting igneous rock in 2018.

The Preselis have Special Area of Conservation status; the citation states that the area is &quot;... exceptional in Wales for the combination of upland and lowland features...&quot; Numerous scarce plant and insect species exist in the hills. For example, they are an important UK site for the rare Southern damselfly, &quot;Coenagrion mercuriale&quot;, where efforts to restore habitat were underway in 2015 and reported in 2020 to have been a success.

===Communications and access===
One major road, the A478, crosses the eastern end of the range, reaching a height of . Two B-class roads, intersecting at New Inn, cross the hills: the B4313 NW-SE, reaching and the B4329 NE-SW, reaching at Bwlch-gwynt (translation: &quot;windy gap&quot;). These, and a number of other minor roads and lanes, provide scenic routes popular with motoring, cycling and walking tourists. The A487 road skirts the western end of the range, near Newport. Cattle grids prevent egress of grazing stock from unenclosed areas of the hills.

The Preselis are popular with walkers wishing to follow prehistoric trails, with walks varying from easy to long-distance. The larger part of the hills is designated under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 as &#x27;open country&#x27; thereby enabling walkers the &#x27;freedom to roam&#x27; across unenclosed land, subject to certain restrictions. An east-west bridleway which runs the length of the main massif (known as Flemings&#x27; Way or the Golden Road), together with spurs to north and south, gives access to mountain bikers and horseriders. There are cycle trails. Paragliding is not permitted without the consent of the land owners, who in 2014 collectively agreed not to allow it.

===Other features===
Castell Henllys, on the A487 road between Eglwyswrw and Felindre Farchog is a reconstructed Iron Age settlement, illustrating what life may have been like in those times.

==Prehistory==
The Preselis are dotted with prehistoric remains, including evidence of Neolithic settlement. More were revealed in an aerial survey during the 2018 heatwave.

Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Wales&quot; published in 1833 said of Maenclochog parish:

Pollen analysis suggests that the hills were once forested but the forests had been cleared by the late Bronze Age.

===Bluestones===
In 1923 the petrologist Herbert Henry Thomas proposed that bluestone from the hills corresponded to that used to build the inner circle of Stonehenge, and later geologists suggested that Carn Menyn (formerly called Carn Meini) was one of the bluestone sources. Recent geological work has shown this theory to be incorrect. It is now thought that the bluestones at Stonehenge and fragments of bluestone found in the Stonehenge &quot;debitage&quot; have come from multiple sources on the northern flanks of the hills, such as at Craig Rhos-y-felin. Advanced details of a recent contribution to the puzzle of the precise origin of the Stonehenge bluestones were published by the BBC in November 2013.

Others theorise that bluestone from the area was deposited close to Stonehenge by glaciation. More detailed discussions on the bluestone topic can be found in the Stonehenge, Theories about Stonehenge and Carn Menyn articles.

Investigations published in 2021 suggested a link between Waun Mawn (see below) and the Stonehenge bluestones, but this was disputed in a 2024 study.

===Individual sites===

The Preselis are rich in sacred and prehistoric sites, many of which are marked on Ordnance Survey maps. They include burial chambers, tumuli, hill forts, hut circles, stone circles, henges, standing stones and other prehistoric remains. These sites are spread across a number of communities that share parts of the Preseli range. Dyfed Archaeological Trust has produced extensive notes on the mountain range and surrounding features and villages.

Some of the more notable are: 
*Bedd Arthur (Neolithic hengiform standing stones)
*Mynydd Carningli (hillfort, SSSI)
*Carn Menyn (chambered cairn)
*Carreg Coetan Arthur (Neolithic dolmen)
*Temple Druid (standing stone, cromlech)
*Pentre Ifan (burial chamber)

Others include:
*Banc Du (evidence of prehistoric settlement)
*Carn Alw (Neolithic settlement)
*Carn Goedog (bluestones and standing stone) 
*Cerrig Lladron (Bronze Age stone row)
*Foel Drygarn (hillfort)
*Foel Cwmcerwyn (tumuli)
*Frenni Fach &amp; Frenni Fawr (tumuli - see also Blaenffos)
*Glandy Cross (prehistoric remains)
*Glyn Gath (tumulus)
*Gors Fawr (stone circle) 
*Mynyedd Melyn (hut circle) 
*Parc-y-Meirw (standing stones) 
*Rhos fach (standing stones) 
*Tafarn y Bwlch (mountain pass and standing stones)
*Tre-Fach (standing stone, prehistoric camp)
*Ty-Meini (standing stone, known as &quot;The Lady Stone&quot;)
*Waun Mawn (standing stones; dismantled stone circle c.3400-3000 BC), grid reference 

==History==
Slate quarrying was once an important industry in the Preselis; the former quarries, worked for much of the 19th century, can still be seen in a number of locations such as Rosebush. Preseli slate was not of roofing quality, but its density made it ideal for machining for building and crafts. Most quarries had closed by the 1930s but there is a workshop at Llangolman where slate is still used to make a variety of craft items.

During the Second World War, the War Office used the Preselis extensively for training exercises by British and American air and ground forces. Its proposed continued use after the war was the subject of a two-year ultimately successful protest by local leaders. The success of the protest was commemorated 60 years on, in 2009, with a plaque at each end of the Golden Road: one at the foot of Foel Drygarn near Mynachlog-ddu, and another near the B4329 at Bwlch-gwynt.

In 2000, Terry Breverton, a lecturer at Cardiff University, in promoting a book he had published, suggested that the rock star Elvis Presley&#x27;s ancestors came from the Preselis and may have had links to a chapel at St Elvis.

<doc id="635080" wikidata="Q894081" url="?curid=635080" title="Borough of Chorley">
<text>The Borough of Chorley is a local government district with borough status in Lancashire, England. It is named after the town of Chorley, which is an unparished area. The borough extends to several villages and hamlets including Adlington, Buckshaw Village, Croston, Eccleston, Euxton and Whittle-le-Woods.

The neighbouring districts are West Lancashire, South Ribble, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton and Wigan.

==History==
The town of Chorley had been governed by improvement commissioners from 1853. The commissioners were reconstituted as a local board in 1863. The board was in turn replaced in 1881 when the town was made a municipal borough.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Adlington Urban District
*Chorley Municipal Borough
*Chorley Rural District
*Withnell Urban District
The new district was named Chorley, and the borough status previously held by the town was passed to the new district on the day that it came into being, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Chorley&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1881.

==Governance==
Chorley Borough Council, which styles itself &quot;Chorley Council&quot;, provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since 2012.

The first election to the reformed borough council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Chorley. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1990 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2026, where a third of the council&#x27;s seats will be contested.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2020 the council has comprised 42 councillors representing 14 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four year term of office. Lancashire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

The wards are:

#Adlington &amp; Anderton
#Buckshaw &amp; Whittle
#Chorley East
#Chorley North East
#Chorley North West
#Chorley North &amp; Astley
#Chorley South East &amp; Heath Charnock
#Chorley South West
#Clayton East, Brindle &amp; Hoghton
#Clayton West &amp; Cuerden
#Coppull
#Croston, Mawdesley &amp; Euxton South
#Eccleston, Heskin &amp; Charnock Richard
#Euxton
The Chorley constituency was coterminous with the borough from 1997 until 2010 when Croston, Eccleston, Bretherton and Mawdesley were transferred to the South Ribble constituency. The current Member of Parliament for Chorley is Lindsay Hoyle, who was first elected to the seat in 1997.

===Premises===

The council&#x27;s main offices are at the Civic Offices on Union Street in Chorley. Council meetings are held at Chorley Town Hall on Market Street, which had been completed in 1879 for the old local board.

==Parishes==

The borough contains 23 civil parishes. The parish council for Adlington takes the style &quot;town council&quot;. The central part of the borough, roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 borough of Chorley, is an unparished area.

<text>Shibe Park ( , rhymes with &quot;vibe&quot;), known later as Connie Mack Stadium, was a ballpark located in Philadelphia. It was the home of the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League (AL) and the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League (NL). When it opened April 12, 1909, it became baseball&#x27;s first steel-and-concrete stadium. In different eras it was home to &quot;The $100,000 Infield&quot;, &quot;The Whiz Kids&quot;, and &quot;The 1964 Phold&quot;. The venue&#x27;s two home teams won both the first and last games at the stadium: the Athletics beat the Boston Red Sox 8–1 on opening day 1909, while the Phillies beat the Montreal Expos 2–1 on October 1, 1970, in the park&#x27;s final contest.

Shibe Park stood on the block bounded by Lehigh Avenue, 20th Street, Somerset Street and 21st Street. It was five blocks west, corner-to-corner, from the Baker Bowl, the Phillies&#x27; home from 1887 to 1938. The stadium hosted eight World Series and two MLB All-Star Games, in 1943 and 1952, with the latter game holding the distinction of being the only All-Star contest shortened by rain (to five innings). In May 1939, it was the site of the first night game played in the American League.

Phillies Hall-of-Fame centerfielder and longtime broadcaster Richie Ashburn remembered Shibe Park: &quot;It looked like a ballpark. It smelled like a ballpark. It had a feeling and a heartbeat, a personality that was all baseball.&quot;

==History==


===1907: Design and construction===
In the early years of the 20th century, the Philadelphia Athletics were so popular that team president Ben Shibe found his team regularly turning away customers from their cramped Columbia Park ballpark even though it was just a few years old. When as many as 28,000 showed up to fill the 9,500 wooden bleacher seats, Shibe and manager/part-owner Connie Mack decided the A&#x27;s needed a new place to play.

He searched for a site for his new park and found one on Lehigh Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets, five blocks west of Baker Bowl, straddling the neighborhoods known as Swampoodle and Goosetown. It was still primitive at the time, an area of &quot;high clay bluffs, rain-washed gullies, quagmires, open fields, even ponds&quot; where chickens pecked and pigs rooted. Although a grid of streets was planned for the area, few actually existed. The area was already served by public transportation: trolleys ran up and down Broad Street and back and forth along Lehigh, and both the Pennsylvania and Reading railroads had major stations nearby. The area had &quot;underachieved&quot; thus far due to the presence of the city&#x27;s Hospital for Contagious Diseases (the &quot;smallpox hospital&quot;) a block west on Lehigh, but Shibe&#x27;s privileged connections in town brought him word that the city would be closing the facility. Without the hospital, the area&#x27;s stigma would eventually dissipate, but at the time, the land was still a bargain.

Shibe quietly assembled title to his square block of land early in 1907, picking up parcels &quot;through a complicated series of acquisitions, preventing price inflation by masking his intentions,&quot; even using straw buyers to keep his name out of the dealings. He spent a total of $67,500 ($ in dollars) on seven land packages totaling , and in February 1908, he arranged to have two projected streets running through his block dropped from the city plan.

For the design and its execution, Shibe hired William Steele and Sons. Their engineering staff had worked with the new technology of steel-reinforced concrete, and designed and built the city&#x27;s first skyscraper, the Witherspoon Building at Walnut and Juniper Streets. The Steele design for the Shibe façade was in the ornate French Renaissance style, including arches, vaultings, and Ionic pilasters. The grandstand walls were to be of red brick and terra cotta and featured elaborate decorative friezes with baseball motifs, while cartouches framed the Athletics&#x27; &quot;A&quot; logo at regular intervals above the entrances. The souvenir program on Opening Day called it &quot;a fetching combination of color.&quot; Gabled dormer windows on the upper deck&#x27;s copper-trimmed green-slate mansard roof looked out over the streets below. Presiding over all were terra cotta busts of Shibe and Mack above the main entrances on Lehigh and 21st.
The signature feature of the exterior design was the octangular tower on the southwest corner. The upper floors would accommodate the A&#x27;s offices, those of Shibe&#x27;s sons Jack and Tom, who ran the day-to-day business aspects of the team, and the domed cupola on the very top were to house Mack&#x27;s office. On the ground floor was a main entrance lobby. Bobby Shantz, pitcher for the A&#x27;s in their last years at Shibe, wrote that the corner tower entrance &quot;looked almost like a church.&quot; Shibe was proud of the egalitarianism of the design; he said it was &quot;for the masses as well as the classes.&quot; In April 1908, design in hand, the Shibes and the Steeles broke ground. With the resources of the Steele firm, construction was speedy, efficient and completed in time to open the 1909 season.

The city was excited about its new ballpark—the &quot;Philadelphia Public Ledger&quot; called it &quot;a palace for fans, the most beautiful and capacious baseball structure in the world.&quot; American League president Ban Johnson pronounced that &quot;Shibe Park is the greatest place of its character in the world.&quot; In more recent times, baseball author David M. Jordan wrote that it was &quot;a splendid forerunner of others like it ... Ben Shibe and the Steeles initiated &#x27;the golden age of ballparks&#x27;.&quot;

The original 1909 configuration was a double-deck grandstand in the southwest corner of the block, with open pavilion seating extending to the foul poles. The outfield was a large rectangle, surrounded by a brick wall that bordered the streets. The deepest part of center field was a square corner from home plate. It was 378 to the left field foul marker, and 340 to right field. The slight upslope of the land from south to north was reflected in a small &quot;terrace&quot; that ran across left and center field. The upper deck was built of wood mounted on steel girders, while the lower deck was built of concrete and steel. The only link with the Columbia Park was the transplanted sod, rolled out at the new venue. The 1909 seating capacity certainly was an upgrade from Columbia Park: 11,000 in the double deck and 12,000 in the two pavilions, for a total of 23,000. Overflow crowds were accommodated by roping off the left field area in front of the wall. Some 500 tons of steel went into the construction.

===April 1909: &quot;Play ball!&quot;===
On Monday, April 12, 1909, the Opening Day proceedings walked a fine line between festival and chaos. More than 30,000 fans showed up and got in; another 15,000 showed up and were turned away. Nervous officials closed the gates hours before game time, turning the outsiders into a &quot;howling mob of thousands&quot; whose pressure forced open one of the gates. Hundreds poured in without paying admission, and an estimated 7,000 standing-room only spectators saw that first game ringing the outfield up to seven-deep, held back by a rope stretched between the left field seats and the right field bleacher. Another 6,000 more looked in from various rooftops around the block. &quot;It seemed as if all of Philadelphia was there&quot;, wrote the &quot;Public Ledger&quot;. Mayor John E. Reyburn called the new facility a &quot;pride to the city&quot; and threw out the first ball. The A&#x27;s beat the Boston Red Sox that day, 8–1.
The Athletics and their new stadium were a hit: the A&#x27;s won pennants—and brought World Series to town—in 1910 and 1911, and by 1913, when they would win another, Shibe initiated the first of the expansions of seating capacity that would continue right on through the 1950s. He called again upon the Steele company and added a new unroofed bleacher section across left field, taking advantage of the site&#x27;s rectangular, rather than square, shape, and also added roof structures to cover the open pavilions down the first base and third base lines.

After Ben Shibe&#x27;s death in 1922, sons Tom and Jack became president and vice president, respectively. and in 1925 they replaced the 1913 open left field bleachers with a double-deck that extended from the foul pole to the center field corner. This construction covered the &quot;terrace&quot; except in the deepest part of center field which still had a slight upslope. Where the upper deck of the main stands abutted the upper deck of the bleachers, there was a slight overhang. Whether this ever affected play is unknown. They also extended the upper deck out over the pavilions. These expansions resulted in another 10,000 seats. In 1928, the brothers installed a mezzanine that added 750 pricey box seats and the following year they raised the original grandstand roof and installed a press box underneath it, along with 3,500 more seats.
For the 1923 season, Connie Mack had moved the infield back an estimated . This was a choice of speed over power, as moving the plate back increased left field and right field dimensions by each. Home runs dropped about 50% for the next three seasons. The Shibe brothers moved it back to its original position, resulting in field dimensions of to right field, 334 to left, and 468 to the square corner in center.

In 1936, A&#x27;s President Tom Shibe died, and Connie Mack succeeded in gaining control of the team by buying out Tom Shibe&#x27;s share from his widow. The move made the Mack family the controlling partner in 1937, though various Shibe family members still had &quot;considerable holdings&quot; in the team.

More renovation—and a round of controversy—came after the 1938 season when Mack sought to install light towers for night play, which local residents were against. They objected in general to the light, noise and traffic that night games would bring to the neighborhood, and objected specifically to the danger of home run balls hitting them as they sat on their porches and to the ability of fans in the upper decks to peer into their bedrooms at night. The matter went to court, and Mack hired a young Philadelphia lawyer to plead his case. The presentation of young Richardson Dilworth, future mayor of the city, carried the day: the A&#x27;s won the case and the light towers went up in time for the 1939 season. The first night game in the AL was at Shibe Park on May 16, 1939: the Indians beat the A&#x27;s, 8–3. 
In 1941, Mack installed a new, larger scoreboard in deep right-center field, replacing the small board that had been in the same general area, and about the same time an imposing sign went up on the left field fence with the message: &quot;Warning: Persons throwing bottles or other missiles will be arrested and prosecuted.&quot; A few years later, he would add a tunnel between the visitors&#x27; clubhouse and their dugout to avoid confrontations with belligerent hometown fans.

After the war, the Macks wanted to expand the seating capacity again, in a park that was running out of room to expand into. In 1949, they proposed erecting the ultimate spite fence: a new double-deck seating section in right field that would boost the park&#x27;s capacity to 50,000. The problem was that the home plate-to-right field axis was the shorter dimension of the Shibe block rectangle, and since the new stand could not intrude into the play area, its fascia would have to be in the plane of the existing right field fence while its hindquarters would have to protrude out back, dangling some above the west sidewalk of North 20th Street and forming a covered arcade walkway. The $2.5-million proposal galvanized the 20th Street neighbors against the A&#x27;s again, and this time the legal team could not overcome the zoning issues.

The Macks did spend $300,000 on renovations in 1949 and managed to shoehorn 2,500 more box seats in; the old lower deck pavilion seating was reconstructed to turn the more distant seats toward the diamond instead of facing the outfield. This resulted in the high corners that were a noticeable feature of the ballpark during its final two decades, the corners being just far enough away from the foul lines to accommodate the bullpens. They also added an &quot;annunciator&quot; on the upper deck beyond third base that flashed the at-bat number; ball-strike-out count; hit or error; and score.

===1935: The &quot;spite fence&quot;===

At the park&#x27;s beginning, homeowners on both Somerset Street and 20th Street had a great view of the proceedings within, thanks to the low outfield fences. While this changed for the people on Somerset in 1913 when Shibe added the left field bleacher section and blocked the view from that direction. It was still a clear shot in from 20th Street over the low, 12-foot wall in right. The view from the roofs, the bedroom bay windows, and even the porch roofs on 20th was as good as from some of the seats inside the park. Pathé News, Universal Newsreel Fox Movietone News even set up cameras at 2739 North 20th as part of their World Series coverage.

The numbers involved in this cottage industry were considerable. A rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch roof. Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand for important games. Housewives served up refreshments for sale and children scurried to the hot dog vendors on the street, bought dogs for a nickel, and brought them back to sell for a dime. With so much money on the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly. Homeowners were soon squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans from the sidewalk into particular homes. By 1929, the extra income from the rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 block of North 20th Street.

As long as the A&#x27;s were winning games and filling the park, the 20th Street entrepreneurs were annoying, but little more, to Mack and the Shibes, but that changed in the early 1930s. Starting in 1932, Mack&#x27;s sell-off of his Second Dynasty stars, combined with general Great Depression hard times, sent attendance plummeting. 20th Streeters, accustomed to the income but now suffering from the tough economy like everyone else, sent reps to the lines – such as they were – at the park box office to offer discount seats and poach customers from the ball club. This was the last straw for Jack Shibe. In the winter of 1934–35, he ordered the fence raised to . While the higher fence was Jack Shibe&#x27;s idea, it became generally known as &quot;Connie Mack&#x27;s Spite Fence.&quot; This was because Mack had been operating head of the franchise since Ben Shibe&#x27;s death.

The fence not only limited the view from the street, but the unattractive corrugated metal structure curtailed much of the goodwill the team had had with its neighbors, goodwill that would never return. It also frustrated many Philadelphia players, both offensively and defensively. Among them, A&#x27;s and Phillies outfielder Elmer Valo and Phillies right fielder Johnny Callison, both lefthanded batters, complained that the high right-field fence cost them many home runs. 
It dogged them when they played the field, too: its rippling corrugations made caroms unpredictable, with some balls dropping straight down, others bounding all the way back to second base and some bouncing radically to one side or another, sometimes into the bullpen. It was &quot;one of the hardest&quot; walls to play in the majors.

===1938–1954: New tenant, new name, new owner===
For several years, the National League&#x27;s Phillies had been trying to escape their dilapidated home, Baker Bowl, and move to Shibe Park as tenants of the A&#x27;s. However, it took them until mid-season 1938 to get out of their lease and move the five blocks west on Lehigh to Shibe Park. The Phillies&#x27; arrangement with Connie Mack was simple: they would pay rent of ten cents a head for every fan that came through the gates, and would hire and pay their own stadium staff on game days. While moving to Shibe likely saved the Phillies from extinction, having two teams play in the park complicated scheduling enormously. The extra income from the Phillies was offset by the crowded baseball schedule tying up the park for nearly all of the summer, so it affected the A&#x27;s bottom line very little. The Phillies&#x27; first game at Shibe Park was a split doubleheader against Boston on July 4, and they finished the season last, 24½ games behind the seventh place Brooklyn Dodgers and 43 games back overall.
21st and Lehigh was one of the gloomiest addresses in baseball in the late 1930s and early 1940s. At the time, both Philadelphia teams were in long stretches of futility. The Phillies had notched one winning season since 1918, while the A&#x27;s had not had a winning season since 1933. Both teams finished last in their leagues in 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1945. Making things worse was that Phillies owner Gerald Nugent was mired in debt to both Mack and the National League, and other NL owners were grumbling about the dismal receipts their Philly trips earned them. In 1943 Nugent agreed in principle to sell the Phillies to Bill Veeck, only to have that sale derailed by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis&#x27;s objections to Veeck&#x27;s plans to stock the Phillies with Negro league stars. The league took over the franchise and sold it for $190,000 and a $50,000 note to lumber baron William Cox, who paid off Mack and put money down on future rent. The flamboyant Cox poured money into the team in an effort to turn it around, but he also abraded fans, his own players, fellow owners, and Landis. The uproar did not last long; when Cox was found to be betting on Phillies games, Landis banned him for life on Nov. 23, 1943.

The same day that Cox was banned from baseball by Landis—Nov. 23, 1943 — Bob Carpenter Sr., scion of the Delaware-based duPont family, bought the team with his son for an estimated $400,000. Carpenter Sr. gave the club presidency to his son, Bob, Jr. – a 28-year-old Delawarean whose mother was a DuPont and who was himself part-owner with Connie Mack of the Wilmington Blue Rocks minor league team. The genial young millionaire admitted at his first press conference that he was short on experience, adding, &quot;But I&#x27;m not worried. I think we can all have a good time.&quot; Carpenter slowly pulled the team out of its &quot;dime store&quot; way of doing business and invested heavily in the farm system, and hired marketing consultants. He upgraded his staff with professional administrators who modernized operations, while spending time in Mr. Mack&#x27;s plush tower office listening to The Grand Old Man of Baseball.

The Carpenters tried to polish the team&#x27;s image and way of doing business. They wanted to shed the image of failure by changing the team&#x27;s nickname. Before the 1944 season, the team held a fan contest soliciting a new team nickname. Management chose &quot;Blue Jays,&quot; the fan submission of Elizabeth Crooks, who received a $100 war bond as compensation. Phillies management said that the Blue Jays name was as an official &quot;additional nickname,&quot; meaning that the team had two official nicknames simultaneously, the Phillies and the Blue Jays. The new Blue Jays moniker was ultimately unpopular; it was officially dropped by the team in January 1950. However, an expansion team in Toronto picked it up for its inaugural season and would coincidentally go on to play the Phillies in the 1993 World Series.

The Blue Jays recorded the city&#x27;s first million-fan season in 1946, and the 1950 &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; Phillies team brought the NL pennant to Philadelphia for the first time in 35 years.
As the Phillies improved baseball life in Philadelphia, there was a decline in the fortunes of the A&#x27;s – in the team, in the owner, and in the ballpark. Mack had alienated many fans in 1915, and again in 1932, when he sold off his pennant-winning teams for cash. His clashes with his neighbors over the spite fence, the night games and the 20th Street overhang sparked ill will between the team and its fan base. The Phillies began to outdraw the A&#x27;s, who were in a vicious circle of bad teams and empty seats.

There was also a precipitous decline in the boss himself. 1950 marked Mack&#x27;s 50th year in Philadelphia and his 87th birthday, and for the better part of a decade it had been obvious he was going senile. He would spend most games asleep in the dugout, leaving game strategy in the hands of his coaches. When he was awake, he often made strange calls that the players and coaches usually disregarded. He would also call for players from decades earlier to pinch-hit; in the 1940s it was not uncommon for him to yell &quot;Baker!&quot; or &quot;Foxx!&quot; – sluggers he had sold off decades before. Most ominously, the crowds at Shibe Park were so small that AL teams could not cover their travel expenses, leading owners to complain that receipts at Shibe Park were too small to justify the trip. Despite this, the A&#x27;s managed to tally three straight winning seasons from 1947 to 1949. This led to hopes that the A&#x27;s would give &quot;The Grand Old Man of Baseball&quot; the perfect 50th anniversary present – a pennant. However, the 1950 season was a disaster. By May 26, they were 11–21, their season all but finished. On that date, Mack&#x27;s sons Roy and Earle gently pushed their father into announcing that he would retire at the end of the season.

The power vacuum in the wake of &quot;Mr. Baseball&#x27;s&quot; exit only worsened the problems, however. Roy and Earle Mack, &quot;undistinguished men living in the shadow of their father,&quot; were from Mack&#x27;s first marriage; their half-brother Connie, Jr.—20 years their junior—came from his second. As the family factions squared off to battle for control of the A&#x27;s, Junior and his mother joined forces with remnants of the Shibe family, who still owned 40% of the stock, while Roy and Earle shelved their years of squabbles to present a united front against what they derisively called &quot;the Shibe faction.&quot; To raise cash for the coming struggle, Roy and Earle made poor decisions. They re-mortgaged the ballpark at a time when cashflow was uncertain, and they leased park concessions to an outside food service corporation. 
The brothers had simultaneously acquired huge debt and lost their best income sources. They managed to buy out Junior, the second Mrs. Mack and the remaining Shibes late in 1950. However, they then made one of the worst of several bad business decisions by mortgaging the team and pledging Shibe Park as collateral, saddling the A&#x27;s with hefty mortgage payments that could have been spent on improving the team and the park. They immediately resumed battling each other, and much of the brothers&#x27; discord made the newspapers. In one famous episode, Earle separated from his wife and moved into a small suite he kept at the ballpark; when Roy heard about it, he had the water shut off in the place.
Despite undeniable deterioration, it would be a few more years before the operation collapsed entirely. In the meantime, the Macks tried to capitalize on the vestiges of affection in the city for their father, who turned 90 years old in December 1952. They opened a nostalgic Elephant Room, filled with memorabilia from the glory days, under the first base grandstand. They renamed the park Connie Mack Stadium in February 1953 for the opening of the 1953 season, hanging a new metal plate over the old &quot;SHIBE PARK&quot; inscription, which was &quot;still written in stone&quot; beneath. Many old-timers refused to acknowledge the change.

The Macks&#x27; bad business decisions finally caught up with them in 1954. While Roy had hoped to keep the team, Earle wanted out, and the meager attendance figures were hard to argue with. The A&#x27;s business plan required attendance of 550,000 to break even, but in 1954 they drew just 305,000. A &quot;Save The A&#x27;s&quot; committee formed to help, publishing daily the turnout needed to stay out of the red, but the turnstile count remained flat while the published number grew each day and the committee collapsed in the stretch run. Even Mayor Joe Clark hurt the effort: he admitted he was a Phillies fan. The A&#x27;s finished 1954 last in the majors, sixty games out of first; their final game at Shibe drew only 1,715 fans.

In early August, Chicago businessman Arnold Johnson stepped forward with a complicated $3.375 million plan to buy the Athletics and move them to Kansas City. He owned Blues Stadium, home to the New York Yankees&#x27; top minor-league affiliate, but intended to sell it to the city for upgrading to major league standards. Roy, Earle and Connie Mack, Sr. would get about $1.5 million, Johnson would pay off the remaining mortgage, and he would assume the $400,000–$800,000 debt to the concessionaires. Very little of Johnson&#x27;s own cash would be involved: the deal depended on real estate and the eagerness of Kansas City town fathers to take on debt for a major league franchise.

The problem with the deal was Connie Mack Stadium. The plan assumed a $1.5 million cash infusion from Bob Carpenter to buy the old ballpark, and he was unenthusiastic. &quot;We need that ballpark as much as we need a hole in the head&quot;, he said. Its upkeep had deteriorated to the point that Carpenter estimated that modernizing the place would cost a million dollars, and even at that he believed it would be impossible to enlarge the seating capacity. He also recognized the growing parking problem, as well as the declining affluence of the neighborhood. He tried to pass on the purchase, reminding Johnson that he had a lease until 1957. Johnson responded by threatening to raise the &quot;rent&quot; to 20 cents a head, and to bill the Phillies for stadium upkeep the A&#x27;s had always paid for. When Carpenter did not show signs of giving in, Johnson said he would call the entire deal off. Carpenter was now in a bind, since there was no other facility in the Delaware Valley that was suitable even for temporary use. Reluctantly, he bought the park for $1.7 million in December, and formed the 21st and Lehigh Realty Company to run it. Nominally, the Phillies were Carpenter&#x27;s tenants, paying him rent just as they had paid rent to the A&#x27;s previously. In practice, however, Carpenter was transferring money from one pocket to the other.
In early 1955, two trucks backed up to the stadium and packed the artifacts from the Elephant Room for removal to Kansas City. Carpenter encouraged Mr. Mack to continue using his opulent tower office in the stadium that now bore his name, which he did almost daily until his death some 13 months later.

===1955–1970: Carpenter, Phillies and decline===
When the stadium opened for the 1955 season, Carpenter&#x27;s first, advertising billboards first appeared on the walls and roofs of the outfield: Foremost dairy, Goldenberg&#x27;s Peanut Chews, Philco, Cadillac, Alpo, Coca-Cola and Martz Tours signs became familiar sights to stadiumgoers and to fans watching on television. A new straight-across fence covered the square corner in center field and most of the remaining &quot;terrace&quot;, reducing the distance to a still-formidable . Distance markers also appeared on the walls for the first time. In addition to the foul poles (334 and 331) and the center field area (447), a 400 marker was posted just to the center field side of the scoreboard, and a 405 marker in the corresponding area of deep left center field. A few years later, wooden fencing covered the rough bricks along the right field wall, and eventually the 331 sign was changed to read 329, although that change had no impact on the actual home run distance.

In 1956, Bob Carpenter replaced the old 1941 scoreboard in right-center field with a new, much larger board, constructed for Connie Mack Stadium. A prominent feature of the new board was the Ballantine Beer advertisement across the top and the Longines clock perched above it. The board&#x27;s superficial resemblance to the similarly adorned board in Yankee Stadium gave rise to the urban legend that the board was acquired second-hand from the Yankees. However, the boards differed in many details, and the Yankee Stadium board remained until 1959 when it was replaced, a few years after Connie Mack Stadium&#x27;s new board had made its appearance.

The big scoreboard extended well above the top of the right field fence, topping out at including the clock. The entire board was in play except for the clock that topped the board: Balls that hit the clock were home runs. Dick Allen was the only player to ever hit a home run over the Ballantine Beer sign and scoreboard. The scoreboard was used through the final year at the ballpark. Also in 1956, a new Plexiglas barrier replaced the old backstop screen, an experiment also conducted at Cincinnati&#x27;s Crosley Field around that same time.

After the death of Mr. Mack in February 1956, a Mack Memorial Committee raised funds and commissioned sculptor Harry Rosin to create a statue of &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot;. On April 16, 1957, it was unveiled across Lehigh Avenue in Reyburn Park – named after the mayor who threw out the first ball at Shibe back in 1909 – as part of the Opening Day ceremonies for the 1957 season. Commissioner Ford Frick, AL president Will Harridge and Leo Durocher all attended, as did many former A&#x27;s players; the ceremony was emceed by sportscaster Bill Campbell. Shortly after, the Philadelphia City Council removed Reyburn&#x27;s name from the park and replaced it with Mack&#x27;s. The statue was later moved to Veterans Stadium in 1971, and ultimately to Citizens Bank Park in 2004.

For the 1960 season, additional box seats in front of the original grandstand reduced the plate-to-screen distance by about . With a couple of years of life left in the park, a curving inner fence across center field reduced the distance from 447 to 410. The final seating capacity of the ballpark, as recorded in the 1970 &quot;Sporting News Baseball Guide&quot;, was 33,608.

Carpenter&#x27;s reluctance about Connie Mack Stadium soon proved justified. He found it impossible to find a way to make the park profitable. His first thought was to extend the length of his income season by adding a football team. In 1959, he sought to buy an American Football League franchise, but the negotiations failed. Additionally, the neighborhood experienced white flight, leading to perceptions of rising crime; the phrase &quot;Watch your car, mister?&quot; became a catch phrase to game attendees. Indeed, the parking problem became the very crux of the issue in the 1950s and 1960s: whereas most people had formerly come to the park on public transportation, after the war, the automobile became the standard mode of transport. There was a 500-car lot, later expanded to 850 cars, across 21st Street, but it was not nearly enough. Carpenter tried to buy the whole block in 1959 for a multi-level garage, but the deal fell through. The team maintained special &quot;Phillies Express&quot; buses to shuttle fans from transportation hubs in Camden and 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby Township, but the service never really caught on. Carpenter also investigated land tracts first in West Philadelphia, then in the Torresdale section of the city, as well as nearby suburban Cheltenham and farther-flung Camden, across the river in New Jersey. But there were prohibitive problems with every one of those proposed sites.

Carpenter finally gave up and in 1961 sold the stadium for $600,000 to a group of New York real estate investors, losing over a million dollars after his 7-year ownership; he secured a 3-year lease and an option to stay through 1967 while he pursued his Torresdale stadium plan. The New York buyers quickly flipped the property to another New York consortium who, assuming the Phillies would be gone by 1967, began planning the demolition of the stadium and construction of a bowling alley and discount store on the site. Then in May 1964, Jerry Wolman, who had just bought the Philadelphia Eagles in February, brought the stadium ownership back to town, paying $757,000 for it as part of a larger real estate deal. Wolman&#x27;s motivations for the purchase are in dispute – all the mortgage shuffling did not slow the decay out at the park – but he claimed he wanted to help the Phillies; the move also put him at the very center of the emerging fight over a new stadium in Philadelphia, which would likely affect his Eagles.

Wolman, the city, and even Carpenter were all exploring plans to solve the town&#x27;s stadium problem. The plan that came closest to fruition was a complicated 1964 package that called for a new stadium with parking for 7,000 cars to be built &quot;on stilts&quot; over the vast railroad yards near 30th Street Station. This plan had considerable backing from city politicians and businessmen, but it too eventually unraveled when federal urban renewal funds did not come through and extended wrangling between Wolman and everyone else involved brought it down. Wolman then tried to sell the park to the city for the nominal price of 50 cents, but Mayor James Tate balked at using city money to pay for major renovations. Eventually the city would build Veterans Stadium in South Philadelphia and the Phillies would leave Connie Mack Stadium.
The final game at Connie Mack Stadium was played on October 1, 1970, with the Phillies defeating the Montreal Expos 2–1 in 10 innings. The occasion was marred by souvenir hunters literally dismantling the stadium even while the game was still in progress. A special post-game ceremony – including a helicopter removal of home plate and delivery of it at The Vet – was cancelled in the mayhem.

==Baseball at the park==
Over its 62 seasons of operation, Shibe Park was home to some of the best teams of their eras – and to some of the worst: the A&#x27;s and the Phillies won eight of their leagues&#x27; pennants, bringing eight World Series to 21st and Lehigh. The two clubs also finished dead last in their leagues a combined 30 times – 18 by the A&#x27;s, 12 by the Phillies. In 1996, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; proclaimed on its cover: &quot;The 1929 Philadelphia A&#x27;s, not the &#x27;27 Yankees, may have been the greatest baseball club ever assembled.&quot;

Over their first six seasons in the park, the A&#x27;s dominated the American League. They won four pennants those six years and were famed for their $100,000 Infield (equal to $ today), said by statistician Bill James to be the greatest infield of all time. Baseball historians since have dubbed the 1910–1914 A&#x27;s clubs &quot;The First Dynasty&quot;; it was &quot;the sport&#x27;s first championship dynasty ever.&quot; After the 1914 team lost the World Series in four games, Connie Mack sold off his top stars. If there was any doubt the dynasty had ended, A&#x27;s teams finished last in the AL the next seven years in a row. The fire sale and subsequent cellar seasons earned Mack and the A&#x27;s tremendous acrimony among Philadelphia fans.

Mack launched a rebuilding program in the mid-1920s, and his effort became &quot;The Second Dynasty&quot;, which culminated in back-to-back-to-back AL pennants in 1929, 1930 and 1931. It was an ill-timed hegemony, though: the Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, and hard times caused baseball attendance to plummet, winners or no. By October 1932, the second great sell-off, of The Second Dynasty, was underway; by 1935, the stars were gone and the franchise had picked up $545,000 cash (equal to $ today) for itself. The A&#x27;s had won the last of their pennants (and would not go to the postseason again until 1971, when they were in Oakland), and goodwill with the fan base was in short supply indeed.

The highs and lows of the A&#x27;s were matched by those of the Phillies – except for most of the highs. As mentioned above, their first decade at Shibe saw the end of one of the longest streaks of futility in major league history – only one winning season from 1918 to 1948. Their 1950 Whiz Kids team did win a pennant – the first for a Philadelphia team in 19 years. The 1964 Phillies came close to doing it the infamous &quot;Phold&quot;. On the other side of the spectrum, the 1961 team managed to set an enduring record, though: their mark (from July 29–August 20) has yet to be bested.

===Memorable games===
In the very first game at Shibe Park, catcher Doc Powers of the Philadelphia Athletics is said by some to have suffered internal injuries after crashing into a wall to catch a foul pop-up. Powers died two weeks later.

The Athletics participated in seven World Series during their tenure at the stadium: 1910, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1929, 1930 and 1931, winning the Fall Classic in 1910, 1911, 1913, 1929, and 1930. The hometown fans got to witness the A&#x27;s clinch world titles at Shibe Park in 1911, 1929 and 1930.

The Phillies participated in one World Series during their tenure at the stadium, in 1950. They were swept by the New York Yankees.

The 1943 All-Star Game was the first of two that would be held at Shibe Park. The 1943 game was hosted by the Athletics, and the 1952 game by the Phillies. The 1943 game was the second of three wartime All-Star Games that would be played at night. The American Leaguers won the game, 5–3.
The 1951 All-Star Game had originally been awarded to the Phillies. However, the city of Detroit was celebrating the 250th anniversary of its founding in 1701 and requested to host the year&#x27;s All-Star Game. The 1951 game was moved to Briggs Stadium, and the Phillies then hosted the 1952 Game. The home city was well represented on the All-Star teams. Phillies pitcher Curt Simmons started the game for the Nationals in front of the home crowd; Phillies shortstop Granny Hamner started and batted eighth; and A&#x27;s pitcher Bobby Shantz pitched the fifth inning for the Americans and struck out Whitey Lockman, Jackie Robinson and Stan Musial in succession. It had rained all day, starting early in the morning and keeping both teams from pre-game warm ups. Rain delayed the first pitch by 20 minutes and eventually caused the game to be called after the fifth inning. The National Leaguers emerged with a then-rare All-Star victory for the Senior Circuit, 3–2.

In September 1923, the A&#x27;s had the misfortune of being no-hit twice in just four days, at home in Shibe Park. On the 4th, Yankees hurler Sam Jones was just one walk away from a perfect game when he no-hit the A&#x27;s; four days later on the 7th, it was Boston&#x27;s Howard Ehmke who was likewise a lone BB away from perfection.

In Game 4 of the 1929 World Series, the A&#x27;s, down 8–0 to the Chicago Cubs, scored ten runs in the 7th inning to win. It was the highest score in a single inning and the biggest comeback in World Series history. The game on May 16, 1939, was the first night game played in the American League. The Cleveland Indians beat the A&#x27;s 8–3 in front of 15,000+ nocturnal fans.

On September 28, 1941, the last day of the season, the Boston Red Sox played a doubleheader at Shibe Park. The day before, Boston manager Joe Cronin gave left fielder Ted Williams the option of sitting out the final two games, because his .3995 average would round up to .400. Williams walked the streets of Philadelphia that night, pondering; he decided the stat would be cheapened if he did sit out, so he played and went 6-for-8. His .406 average for 1941 was the last .400-plus average in the major leagues. 
Over the years, four A&#x27;s pitchers tossed no-hitters in Shibe Park: Chief Bender in 1910, Bullet Joe Bush in 1916, Dick Fowler in 1945 and Bill McCahan in 1947.

===Home runs===
The ballpark was the site of some notable home run feats. On May 29, 1909, Frank &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker used his bat to hit the first home run in Shibe Park: over the right field fence, off Boston&#x27;s RHP Frank Arellanes, who had previously served him up a grand slam pitch in Boston on April 24. Montreal Expos catcher John Bateman hit the last home run there on September 29, 1970, in the antepenultimate game played at the stadium. 
Babe Ruth, who got his first hit as a Yankee at Shibe Park on April 14, 1920, hit a blast to deep left-center on September 9, 1921, that cleared the then-single bleacher stand, went across the street, and hit a tree over away. On May 21, 1930, Ruth hit one to right field over the wall that landed in Opal Street, the alley behind the second row of houses, again over distant and said to be the longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park. The longest strike ever hit there is said to be Ted Williams&#x27;s prodigious foul ball blast that cleared the high roof at the right field line, passed over 20th, over Opal, over Garnet, and came down on 19th Street.

On June 3, 1932, Lou Gehrig hit four homers in one game. He hit two to the left field bleachers, two over the right field wall, and had a shot at a fifth homer with a deep fly to center, but center fielder Al Simmons snared it on a running catch. A&#x27;s slugger Jimmie Foxx was also known for tape-measure blasts, especially during 1932 when he hit 58 home runs and challenged Ruth&#x27;s season record of 60. Foxx was the all-time home run hitter at Shibe Park, with 195 round-trippers between 1927 and 1945.

On May 24, 1936, New York Yankees second baseman Tony Lazzeri hit two grand slams – one in the second off George Turbeville, one in the fifth off Herman Fink – and a solo shot in the seventh off Woody Upchurch, setting a single game RBI record of 11 (he also hit a 2-RBI triple). The Yanks prevailed, 25–2. Yankee sluggers set the record for home runs hit in a doubleheader when they visited Shibe Park on June 28, 1939. Tommy Henrich, Bill Dickey, George Selkirk and Frankie Crosetti hit one each and Joe Gordon, Babe Dahlgren and Joe DiMaggio all hit three. Total: 13 round-trippers. The Yanks won both ends, 23–2 and 10–0.

On June 2, 1949, the Phillies hit five home runs in the 8th inning: Del Ennis, Willie Jones and Schoolboy Rowe each smacked one and Andy Seminick hit two off Cincinnati Reds pitchers Ken Raffensberger, Jess Dobernic and Kent Peterson in a 12–3 win.

In later years, Dick Allen hit some booming drives over the roof of the double-decked bleachers, in the general direction of the 1921 Ruthian shot. He also cleared the big scoreboard in right-center field. Despite his hitting prowess, Allen was unpopular with the fans, and fellow long-ball hitter Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates joked that the reason Allen was booed at home was that he hit his long drives clear out of the stadium: &quot;When he hits a homer, there&#x27;s no souvenir.&quot;
The single most famous home run hit at Shibe Park may be the one that stayed inside the park, in Game 4 of the 1929 World Series vs. the Chicago Cubs. Mule Haas of the A&#x27;s hit a deep fly to center field which Hack Wilson of the Cubs lost in the sun. It landed behind him and rolled toward the center field corner, nearly from home plate. As Wilson tried to chase down the ball, Haas circled the bases. The A&#x27;s scored a total of 10 runs in that inning, and went on to defeat the Cubs in the Series.

===Negro league baseball===
Shibe Park hosted its first Negro league games in 1919 when the Hilldale Club and Bacharach Giants played home games at the ballpark. Games between white major league teams and Negro league teams were not uncommon. The Bacharach Giants hosted an exhibition game at Shibe Park against John McGraw&#x27;s New York Giants on October 6, 1919.

Shibe Park was a neutral site for Negro World Series games. The Cleveland Buckeyes defeated the Homestead Grays, 5–0, on September 20, 1945, to win game four and sweep the Series, four games to zero. Cleveland&#x27;s Frank Carswell defeated Homestead&#x27;s Ray Brown.

The Negro League Philadelphia Stars played home games at Shibe Park in the 1940s. The team&#x27;s usual home field, at 44th and Parkside seated approximately 6,000 fans; the Stars were able to draw between 10,000 and 12,000 to Shibe Park. They often played double-headers on Monday nights, which was a travel day for the major league clubs. 

Former Stars player Gene Benson would later recall the team playing about twenty games per season at Shibe Park. The Stars would dress in the A&#x27;s locker room. The Stars drew their largest crowd on June 21, 1943, when 24,165 fans witnessed them defeating Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs.

==Professional football==
Shibe Park hosted the Frankford Yellow Jackets against the Chicago Bears on December 5, 1925, and the Yellow Jackets against the Bears on December 4, 1926. It also served as the site of two AFL games in 1926, the Philadelphia Quakers against the Los Angeles Wildcats on November 20, 1926, and the Quakers against the New York Yankees on November 27, 1926. The stadium hosted the December 12, 1925, Pottsville Maroons–Notre Dame All-Stars game. The Maroons&#x27; NFL franchise was suspended as a result of the team&#x27;s participation in that contest, costing Pottsville the 1925 NFL championship. 

The National Football League&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles moved to Shibe Park in 1940 and played their home games at the stadium through 1957.

To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management set up stands in right field, parallel to Twentieth Street. Some twenty feet high, these &quot;east stands&quot; had twenty-two rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe Park to over thirty-nine thousand, but the Eagles rarely drew more than twenty-five to thirty thousand.

The Eagles played the 1948 NFL Championship Game in a blizzard; the home team defeated the Chicago Cardinals 7–0, the only score being a Steve Van Buren touchdown. The Eagles left Connie Mack Stadium after the 1957 season for Franklin Field. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.
==Boxing, politics, soccer, religion==

Shibe scion Jack briefly tried his hand as a boxing promoter in the early 1910s, shortly after his father built Shibe Park, and although he did not pursue the career, he did make the acquaintance of other promoters in the Philadelphia boxing world, including Bob Gunnis and Herman &quot;Muggsy&quot; Taylor. Gunnis and Taylor became among the first promoters to book a bout into a major league baseball stadium when they brought Johnny Dundee vs. George Chaney to Shibe Park in July 1917, and although the fight itself was unremarkable, the concept propelled Gunnis and Taylor to the forefront of their trade. Over the next forty years, perhaps a hundred boxing cards took place at Shibe, some of them big-time pairings and even championship bouts. Benny Leonard retained his championship against challenger Johnny Kilbane in 1917, and 1928&#x27;s Benny Bass vs. Harry Blitman was said by sportswriters to be the best featherweight bout in the city&#x27;s history. In the 1950s, Gil Turner, Ike Williams, Charley Fusari and many other top fighters fought important bouts at Shibe Park. At first, groundskeepers set the ring up over the pitcher&#x27;s mound, but soon this changed to the area over home plate with the baseball backstops dismantled; spectators sat in the main grandstand for the fight. Even before the installation of the light towers in 1939, staging night boxing was easy because of the vastly smaller area that needed to be lit –portable searchlights did the trick.

In October 1948, the US national soccer team played three international friendlies against the Israel national team. The first game was played at the Polo Grounds and the last at Ebbets Field. In the middle match on October 17, the US beat Israel at Shibe Park, shutting them out 4–0 before 30,000 fans.

The events were not always sports-related: the 30-some-thousand seats were a good venue for political rallies. In 1940, Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie came to Shibe for a speech and rally. Four years later, the man who beat Willkie, Franklin D. Roosevelt, made one of his few 1944 public appearances at 21st and Lehigh; he won again. In 1948, third-party Progressive candidate Henry A. Wallace made his nomination acceptance speech there.

Promoters tried jazz concerts in 1959, but the place was deemed &quot;not intimate enough&quot; for jazz. The rodeo came in 1962, but hooves proved too destructive of the turf. The Ringling Brothers circus set up shop at Shibe in 1955 when they were denied occupancy at all their regular Philadelphia venues, and evangelist Billy Graham had many successful crusades there. The stadium management&#x27;s favorite visitors were the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, &quot;because the Witnesses left the park immaculate.&quot;

==Through the turnstiles==

The Shibe Park turnstiles registered some 47 million clicks over 62 seasons of baseball. The Phillies were first to break the million mark for a season in 1946 with a team that was a &quot;harbinger of the Whiz Kids.&quot; The star-crossed 1964 Phillies drew the highest single-season attendance with 1,425,891 in that infamous year; the Athletics&#x27; best-attended season was 1948, when they drew 945,076 fans.

The largest single-day baseball crowd came on May 11, 1947, when Jackie Robinson made his Philadelphia debut; the Phillies beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in both ends of their doubleheader that day as 41,660 looked on. The Athletics&#x27; best single-day turnout was also for a doubleheader, with the Washington Senators, on August 3, 1931, as the Second Dynasty team was closing in on its third AL pennant in a row; they swept both games before a crowd of 38,800-plus.

Low-ebb seasons were the Phillies&#x27; 1940 turnout of 207,177 and the Athletics&#x27; turnout of 146,223 in 1915, the year after Connie Mack sold off the stars from his 1914 pennant-winning team.

==Last years==

In March 1971, bankrupt Jerry Wolman – who had to sell the Eagles in 1969 – agreed in principle to sell the Connie Mack Stadium property to Louis Graboyes and S. Solis Tollin. Without any permanent tenants for the stadium, Wolman had found himself unable to meet mortgage payments on it. The sale to Graboyes and Tollin, however, was never closed.

On August 20, 1971, the Connie Mack statue was re-dedicated at Veterans Stadium. That same day, while an evangelical revival group was setting up its tent, two stepbrothers, aged 9 and 12, sneaked into the park and started a small fire that grew into a 5-alarmer, burning through much of the original upper deck, collapsing the roof and leaving twisted steel supports visible from the streets. The park remained that way for four years, slowly deteriorating and becoming increasingly hazardous. Squatters took up revolving residence, and trash and debris accumulated. Small trees took root and flourished, while the once-manicured emerald turf became unruly knee-high stalks. In October 1975, Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Ned Hirsh ordered what remained of the stadium razed. The corner tower and its domed cupola, Connie Mack&#x27;s original office, was the last segment of the ballpark demolished, on July 13, 1976—the same day as the 47th MLB All-Star Game, played at Veterans Stadium.

Although Wolman was in default on the mortgage and there were many liens against the property – the most recent being the $100,000+ demolition tab from Geppert Brothers – he continued to own it until 1981, when he sold it to Deliverance Evangelistic Church, a nondenominational evangelical Christian congregation. In 1991, the church began constructing a 5,100-seat sanctuary on the site, which was completed a year later, and formally dedicated on August 30, 1992.
==Contemporary culture==
Shibe Park&#x27;s rooftop bleachers became one of the inspirations for a special seating area in Citizens Bank Park when it opened in 2004. Of their &quot;Rooftop Bleacher Seats&quot;, the Phillies announced, &quot;The Phillies are bringing back rooftop bleacher seats, a Shibe Park phenomenon of the 1920s when residents of 20th Street built bleacher seats on top of their roofs. The seats are located on top of the buildings along Ashburn Alley.&quot;

Shibe Park was one of 10 historic ballparks celebrated on the USPS 34-cent Commemorative issue stamps, &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Legendary Playing Fields&quot;, released June 27, 2001. The reverse of the Shibe Park stamp reads, &quot;The first Major League Baseball concrete-and-steel stadium, Philadelphia&#x27;s Shibe Park featured a -high right field wall, as well as a façade with stately columns and a French Renaissance cupola.&quot; In 2009, the Philadelphia Brewing Co. released an ale named &quot;Fleur de Lehigh&quot;, which features Shibe Park on the label.

<text>Tenby () is a seaside town and community in the county of Pembrokeshire, Wales. It lies within Carmarthen Bay.

Notable features include of sandy beaches and the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, the 13th-century medieval town walls, including the Five Arches barbican gatehouse, Tenby Museum and Art Gallery, the 15th-century St. Mary&#x27;s Church, and the National Trust&#x27;s Tudor Merchant&#x27;s House.

Boats sail from Tenby&#x27;s harbour to the offshore monastic Caldey Island. St Catherine&#x27;s Island is tidal and has a 19th-century Palmerston Fort.

The town has an operating railway station. The A478 road from Cardigan, Ceredigion, connects Tenby with the M4 via the A477, the A40 and the A48 in approximately .

== History ==

With its strategic position on the far west coast of Britain, and a natural sheltered harbour from both the Atlantic Ocean and the Irish Sea, Tenby was a natural settlement point, probably a hill fort with the mercantile nature of the settlement possibly developing under Hiberno-Norse influence. The earliest reference to a settlement at Tenby is in , a poem probably from the 9th century, preserved in the 14th-century Book of Taliesin.

Tenby was taken by the Normans, when they invaded West Wales in the early 12th century. The town&#x27;s first stone-wall fortification was on Castle Hill. Tenby&#x27;s mercantile trade grew as it developed as a major seaport in Norman controlled Little England beyond Wales. However, the need for additional defences became paramount after the settlement and castle were successfully attacked and sacked by Welsh forces of Maredudd ap Gruffydd and Rhys ap Gruffydd in 1153. Sacking of the town was repeated in 1187 and again by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1260. After the final attack, William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke ordered the construction of the Tenby town walls in the late 13th century. The stone curtain wall, towers and gates enclosed a large part of the settlementnow known as the &quot;old town&quot;. With the construction of the town walls, Tenby Castle was made obsolete and had been abandoned by the end of the 14th century.

In 1457, Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, agreed to share with the town&#x27;s merchants the costs of refurbishing and improving Tenby&#x27;s defences because of its economic importance to this part of Wales. Work included heightening the wall to include a second tier of higher arrow slits behind a new parapet walk. Additional turret towers were added to the ends of the walls where they abutted the cliff edges, and the dry ditch outside walls was widened to .

Consequently, in the Late Middle Ages, Tenby was awarded royal grants to finance the maintenance and improvement of its defences and the enclosure of its harbour. Traders sailed along the coast to Bristol and Ireland and further afield to France, Spain and Portugal. Exports included wool, skins, canvas, coal, iron and oil; while in 1566 Portuguese seamen landed the first oranges in Wales. It was during this period that the town was so busy and important, it was considered to be a national port. During the Wars of the Roses Henry Tudor, the future King Henry VII of England, sheltered at Tenby before sailing into exile in 1471.

In the mid-16th century, the large D-shaped tower formerly known as the &quot;Five Arches tavern&quot; was built following fears of a second Spanish Armada.

Two key events caused the town to undergo rapid and permanent decline in importance. First, Tenby declared for Parliament in the English Civil War. After resisting two attempts by the Royalists forces of Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield, it was finally taken in 1648. Ten weeks later the shattered town was surrendered to Colonel Thomas Horton, who welcomed Oliver Cromwell shortly afterwards. Second, a plague outbreak killed half of the town&#x27;s remaining population in 1650.

With limited infrastructure, resources and people, the town&#x27;s economy fell into decline. Most of the merchant and business class left, resulting in the town&#x27;s decay and ruin. By the end of the 18th century, John Wesley noted during his visit how: &quot;Two-thirds of the old town is in ruins or has entirely vanished. Pigs roam among the abandoned houses and Tenby presents a dismal spectacle.&quot;

Another war led to a resurgence in Tenby&#x27;s fortunes. Since 1798, the French General Napoleon Bonaparte had begun conquering Europe restricting the rich British upper classes from making their Grand Tours to continental spa towns. In 1802 local resident, merchant banker and politician, Sir William Paxton, bought his first property in the old town. From this point onwards he invested heavily in the area with the full approval of the town council.

With the growth in saltwater sea-bathing for health purposes, Paxton engaged engineer James Grier and architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell (the same team who had built his home at Middleton Hall) to create a &quot;fashionable bathing establishment suitable for the highest society.&quot; His sea-bathing baths came into operation in July 1806 and, after acquiring the Globe Inn, transformed it into &quot;a most lofty, elegant and convenient style&quot; to lodge the more elegant visitors to his baths. Cottages were erected adjoining the baths with adjoining livery stables and coach house.

A road was built on arches overlooking the harbour at Paxton&#x27;s full expense in 1814. He had a private act of Parliament passed that enabled fresh water to be piped through the town. Despite these accomplishments, his 1809 theatre was closed in 1818 due to lack of patronage. The Market Hall was completed in 1829 and remodelled to serve as Tenby Town Hall in 1860.

Paxton also took in &quot;tour&quot; developments in the area as required by rich Victorian tourists. This included the discovery of a chalybeate spring in his own park at Middleton Hall, and coaching inns from Swansea to Narberth. He built Paxton&#x27;s Tower, in memorial to Lord Nelson whom he had met in 1802 when mayor of Carmarthen. Paxton&#x27;s efforts to revive the town succeeded and after the Battle of Trafalgar, the growth of Victorian Tenby was inevitable.

Through both the Georgian and Victorian eras Tenby was renowned as a health resort and centre for botanical and geological study. With many features of the town being constructed to provide areas for healthy seaside walks, due to the walkways being built to accommodate Victorian nannies pushing prams, many of the beaches today still retain good disabled access. In 1856 writer Mary Ann Evans (pen-name George Eliot) accompanied George Henry Lewes to Tenby to gather materials for his work &quot;Seaside Studies&quot; published in 1858.
In 1852, the Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners&#x27; Royal Benevolent Society deployed a lifeboat to the town, taken over in 1854 by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. In 1905 a slip-way equipped lifeboat station was built on Castle Hill. It was replaced by a modern station in 2008.

Tenby railway station and the Pembroke and Tenby Railway were opened as far as Pembroke on 30 July 1863. The extended line to Pembroke Dock opened on 8 August 1864. In 1866, the line was connected to Whitland railway station. In 1867, work began on the construction of the Palmerston Fort on St Catherine&#x27;s Island. The Army had control of the fort during 18871895.

The old town castle walls have survived, as does the Victorian revival architecture in a pastel colour scheme. The economy is based on tourism, supported by a range of craft, art and other stores. , there are 372 listed buildings and other structures in and around Tenby.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Tenby, at community (town) and county level: Tenby Town Council and Pembrokeshire County Council. The town council is based at the De Valence Pavilion on Upper Frog Street.
Tenby was an ancient borough, having been given a charter in 1290 by William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and being formally incorporated as a borough by Elizabeth I in 1581. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836. From 1860 until 1947 the borough council was based at Tenby Town Hall on High Street. In 1947 the council moved to Croft House on The Norton, later renaming it Guildhall. Tenby Borough Council was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of the new district of South Pembrokeshire within the county of Dyfed on 1 April 1974. A community was established to cover the area of the former borough, with its council taking the name Tenby Town Council. The town council continued to be based at the guildhall until the mid-1980s when it moved to the De Valence Pavilion on Upper Frog Street. The district of South Pembrokeshire was abolished in 1996, with the area becoming part of a re-established Pembrokeshire.

== Education ==

There are four schools in the Tenby schools area, consisting of three primary schools and one secondary school: Ysgol Hafan-y-Mor, Tenby Church in Wales Primary School, St. Teilo&#x27;s RC School and Ysgol Greenhill Secondary.

Pupils from St. Teilo&#x27;s School and Tenby Church in Wales School are automatically enrolled in the Greenhill School, but parents can enrol them into a different school. Ysgol Hafan y Môr is a Welsh language medium school. Most of the pupils go on to Ysgol y Preseli, a Welsh-medium secondary school in Crymych.

Previous schools in the area were Tenby V.C. Infants School which was an English medium school with a Welsh unit. Pupils from this school would automatically enrol in Tenby Junior School which has now been converted into Ysgol Hafan y Môr. Tenby V.C. Infant school was demolished in 2016 and turned into a field for the nearby Greenhill School.

== Tourism ==

Attractions include the two sheltered, sandy beaches and the coastal boat trips to Caldey Island. St Catherine&#x27;s Island is tidal and the site of St Catherine&#x27;s Fort a 19th-century Palmerston Fort. In August 2016, the fort faced an &quot;uncertain future&quot; and was closed to the public. Tenby has shops, pubs and restaurants to cater for visitors. The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; rated Tenby&#x27;s Castle Beach the best beach in the UK in 2019.

==Transport==

In 1970, the Tenby Sea Swimming Association started the Boxing Day Swim. It is Tenby&#x27;s main Christmas attraction now, with approximately 600 swimmers, most in fancy dress, watched by thousands of onlookers. Each swimmer who enters for a charity receives a medal. The Osborne family has been associated with the event from the beginning and Chris Osborne, chairman of TSSA has seen it take place in every weather condition, from brilliant sunshine to freezing winds.

== Wally the Walrus ==

On 19 March 2021, an Arctic walrus was spotted on the rocks of Broad Haven South beach, after initially making the journey over from Ireland. During its time in Tenby, it was situated primarily on the new RNLI Lifeboat Tenby slipway. Wally was not spotted between 5 and 8 April 2021 and there were concerns that sightseers had driven him away, but he was back regularly resting on the slipway later in the month, and on one occasion had to be moved to allow the slipway to be used.

Some believed that the walrus made the journey from the Arctic on an ice floe. The RSPCA believes this is the most southernly sighting of the species; occasionally they can be seen in Scotland.

Despite spending most of his days resting and scavenging for food, he has been causing some mischief. It was reported that he capsized a dingy and damaged a fishing boat trying to board the vessels.

<text>The Borough of Oswestry was a local government district with borough status in Shropshire, England, from medieval times until its abolition in 2009. Until 1974 the borough just covered the town of Oswestry itself. The borough was enlarged in 1974 to also include the surrounding rural area.

Its council was based in Oswestry, the only town and largest settlement in the borough. Villages in the borough included Morda, St Martin&#x27;s, Whittington, Gobowen, Pant, Trefonen and Ruyton XI Towns.

The district and its council were abolished on 1 April 2009 when the new Shropshire unitary authority was established, as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

==History==
The town of Oswestry was an ancient borough, governed under the terms of various charters dating back to at least 1398. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. By the mid-twentieth century some municipal boroughs were considered too small to efficiently provide all the services expected of them, and so the government introduced the concept of rural boroughs under the Local Government Act 1958. This allowed a small municipal borough to merge with a neighbouring rural district, whilst allowing the former municipal borough to retain some of its privileges, such as the ability to appoint a mayor. In other regards, such rural boroughs were comparable to parish councils. Oswestry became a rural borough on 1 April 1967, becoming part of the surrounding Oswestry Rural District.

On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the Oswestry Rural District became a non-metropolitan district, and the borough status which had previously only applied to the town of Oswestry itself was transferred to the larger district, allowing the new district council to take the name Oswestry Borough Council.

The borough of Oswestry and its council were abolished on 1 April 2009, when the new Shropshire Council unitary authority was established, as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

==Political control==
The first elections to the enlarged council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties:

===Leadership===
The last leader of the council was David Lloyd, a Conservative.

<text>The Prix Ars Electronica is one of the best known and longest running yearly prizes in the field of electronic and interactive art, computer animation, digital culture and music. It has been awarded since 1987 by Ars Electronica (Linz, Austria).

In 2005, the Golden Nica, the highest prize, was awarded in six categories: &quot;Computer Animation/Visual Effects,&quot; &quot;Digital Musics,&quot; &quot;Interactive Art,&quot; &quot;Net Vision,&quot; &quot;Digital Communities&quot; and the &quot;u19&quot; award for &quot;freestyle computing.&quot; Each Golden Nica came with a prize of €10,000, apart from the u19 category, where the prize was €5,000. In each category, there are also Awards of Distinction and Honorary Mentions.

The Golden Nica trophy is a replica of the Greek Nike of Samothrace. It is a handmade gold-plated wooden statuette that is approximately 35 cm high with a wingspan of about 20 cm. 

&quot;Prix Ars Electronica&quot; is a phrase composed of French, Latin and Spanish words, loosely translated as &quot;Electronic Arts Prize.&quot;

<doc id="635098" wikidata="Q696908" url="?curid=635098" title="Kingdom of Poland (1917–1918)">
<text>The Kingdom of Poland (, ), also known informally as the Regency Kingdom of Poland (), was a short-lived polity that was proclaimed during World War I by the German Empire and Austria-Hungary on 5 November 1916 on the territories of formerly Russian-ruled Congress Poland held by the Central Powers as the Government General of Warsaw and which became active on 14 January 1917. It was subsequently transformed between 7 October 1918 and 22 November 1918 into the independent Second Polish Republic, the customary ceremonial founding date of the latter being later set at 11 November 1918.

In spite of the initial total dependence of this client state on its sponsors, it ultimately served against their intentions in the aftermath of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 as the cornerstone proto-state of the nascent Second Polish Republic, the latter composed also of territories never intended by the Central Powers to be ceded to Poland, and therefore played a crucial role in the resurrection of Polish statehood.

==Rationale==
The decision to propose the restoration of Poland after a century of partitions was taken up by the German policymakers in an attempt to legitimize further imperial presence in the occupied territories and create a buffer state to prevent future wars with Russia. The plan was followed by the German propaganda pamphlet campaign delivered to the Poles in 1915, claiming that the German soldiers were arriving as liberators to free Poland from subjugation by the Russian Empire. However, the German High Command under Erich Ludendorff also wanted to annex around 30,000 square kilometers of the territory of former Congress Poland, and planned to evict up to 3 million Poles and Jews to make room for German colonists in the so-called Polish Border Strip plan. The German government used punitive threats to force Polish landowners living in the German-occupied Baltic states to relocate and sell their Baltic property to the Germans in exchange for entry to Poland. Parallel efforts were made to remove Poles from Polish territories of the Prussian Partition.

==Early plans==
===Germany===

With the onset of the war in 1914, for the purposes of securing Germany&#x27;s eastern border against the Russian imperial army, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, the German chancellor, decided on the annexation of a specific strip of land from Congress Poland, known later on as the Polish Border Strip. In order to avoid adding the Polish population there to the population of imperial Germany, it was proposed that the Poles would be ethnically cleansed to a proposed new Polish state further east, while the strip would be resettled with Germans.

German Emperor Wilhelm II conceived of creating a dependent Polish state from territory conquered from Russia. This new autonomous Kingdom of Poland would be ruled by a German prince and have its military, transportation, and economy controlled by Germany. Its army and railway network would be placed under Prussian command.

In several memoranda sent during 1915 and 1916, Hans Hartwig von Beseler, the Governor-General of the Polish areas under German control, proposed the establishment of an independent Polish state. Under the influence of General Erich Ludendorff, then in effect the director of Germany&#x27;s eastern European operations, this proposal included the annexation of considerable amounts of land by Germany, Lithuania, and Austria-Hungary. Gerhard von Mutius, the cousin of Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg and the foreign office&#x27;s representative at Beseler&#x27;s headquarters, disputed the use of annexation, insisting that &quot;if the military interests allow for it, divisions and secessions should be avoided&quot;, as such a policy would secure an &quot;anti-Russian inclination [toward] the new Poland&quot;.

Similar plans were advanced by influential German intellectuals in the early years of the war. Among them were Hans Delbrück, Friedrich Naumann, and Paul Rohrbach. They generally argued that because Polish nationalism and Polish society were so highly developed, Germany would encounter severe resistance if they attempted to annex large territories in Poland. They concluded that Germany could only effectively project power into Poland by establishing an autonomous Polish state as a German protectorate.


The borders of this &quot;autonomous&quot; Poland were to be changed in favour of Germany with the annexation of the so-called &quot;Polish Border Strip&quot; which would lead to the annexation of considerable parts of Polish territory that had been part of the Russian partition of Poland. By the end of 1916, Germany wanted to annex almost 30,000 square kilometres of Polish territory. These lands were to be settled by ethnic Germans, while the Polish and Jewish population was to be removed.

After the expected victory the Polish economy was to be dominated by Germany and preparations were made for German control over the Polish railway system, shipping in the Vistula and industrial areas in Dąbrowa basin, Radom and Kielce.

Such plans were also proposed by members of the German minority in Poland in the Łódź area, who protested the Act of 5th November, and in a letter to the German government demanded the annexation of western Poland by Germany and settlement of ethnic Germans in those areas.

German candidates for the throne were disputed between the royal houses of Saxony, Württemberg and Bavaria. Bavaria demanded that their Prince Leopold, the Supreme Commander of the German forces on the Eastern front, become the new monarch. Württemberg&#x27;s candidate Duke Albrecht was considered suitable for the throne because he belonged to the Catholic line of the house. The Saxon House of Wettin&#x27;s claim to the Polish throne was based on three previous Saxon rulers - Electors Augustus the Strong and Frederick Augustus II and King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony - having ruled over Poland before.

===Austria-Hungary===
Austria-Hungary allowed formation of a Polish quasi-government, the Supreme National Committee, and had three different ideas regarding Poland. One, the &quot;Austro-Polish Solution&quot;, involved the creation of a Polish kingdom under the Emperor of Austria, who, among his other titles, was already King of Galicia and Lodomeria. German and Magyar (Hungarian) elements within the Habsburg monarchy opposed such a move for fear of creating a predominantly Slavic area. Unlike Emperor Francis Joseph, however, Charles I of Austria, who had acceded to the Habsburg thrones in 1916, promoted the idea. The other two ideas involved the division of former Congress Poland between Germany and Austria-Hungary, or between Austria-Hungary and a state built from Lithuania, Belarus and the remnants of Congress Poland to create a new version of the 1795 dissolved Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

According to Polish historian Janusz Pajewski &quot;the Austrians had underestimated Germany&#x27;s desire to determine Poland&#x27;s fate&quot;. They did recognise, according to Prime Minister Karl von Stürgkh, that &quot;Poles will remain Poles [...] even 150 years after Galicia was joined to Austria, Poles still didn&#x27;t become Austrians&quot;.

Of the candidates for the new Polish throne, Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria () and his son Charles Albert were early contenders. Both resided in the Galician town of Saybusch (now Żywiec) and spoke Polish fluently. Charles Stephen&#x27;s daughters were married to the Polish aristocrats Princes Czartoryski and Radziwiłł.

By early 1916, the &quot;Austro-Polish Solution&quot; had become hypothetical. Erich von Falkenhayn, the German Chief of the General Staff, had rejected the idea in January, followed by Bethmann Hollweg in February. Bethmann Hollweg had been willing to see an Austrian candidate on the new Polish throne, so long as Germany retained control over the Polish economy, resources and army.
During the first year of the war, German and Austrian troops quickly conquered Russian Vistula Land, former Congress Poland, and in 1915 divided its administration between a German Governor General in Warsaw and an Austrian counterpart in Lublin. During the German military campaign in the ethnically Polish territory, Poles were subjected to forced labour and confiscation of food and private property.

==Preparations for Polish statehood==

===Proclamation of two Emperors promising a Polish state===

After the German offensive failed in the Battle of Verdun and Austria suffered military setbacks against Italy, Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, now supreme commanders of the German military and increasingly the dominant force over the politics of both Germany and Austria, changed their positions on Poland: having previously considered Poland as a bargaining card in the event of a separate peace with Russia, they now postulated the establishment of a German dependency, hoping that the creation of a Polish army could replace the Central Powers&#x27; losses. In October 1916, at joint deliberations at Pszczyna, the German and Austrian leadership agreed to accelerate the proclamation promising the creation of a Polish state in the future. Although early plans called for an Austro-Polish solution, they were abandoned by the German Chancellor in February 1916 in the face of growing dependence of Austria-Hungary on Germany. Both control over Polish economy and raw resources was to be in Germany&#x27;s hands and Germany would also be in total control over the Polish army.
In the meantime, General Beseler had managed to gain support among pro-Austrian Poles and the followers of Józef Piłsudski. The Narodowa Demokracja party (centred in Paris), however, rejected any cooperation with the Central Powers. After the German Emperor and Chancellor met with a Polish delegation led by Józef Brudziński, the final details were arranged. On 5 November 1916, Governor Beseler at Warsaw issued an Act of 5th November, in which he promised that a Polish state would be created, without specifying any future Polish ruler, Polish borders or system of governance and, for the first time since 1831, had the Warsaw Royal Castle decorated with Polish flags. The Austrian Governor-General Kuk issued a similar proclamation at Lublin. A pro-German faction led by Władysław Studnicki existed but didn&#x27;t gain any significant backing among the Polish population.

===Occupation authorities===
Immediately after the proclamation, the German governor-general in Warsaw issued an advertisement for military recruitment, resulting in Polish protests which especially decried the absence of a Polish government. In December 1916, a brigade of Polish legions under Stanisław Szeptycki moved into Warsaw to form the officer corps of the new Polish army.

The occupation authorities included German Governor-General at Warsaw, commander-in-chief of the Polska Siła Zbrojna — Hans Hartwig von Beseler (1 October 1915 – 11 November 1918); as well as the Austro-Hungarian Governors-General at Lublin: including Major General Erich Freiherr von Diller (1 October 1915 – 20 April 1916), Feldzeugmeister Karl Kuk (21 April 1916 – April 1917); as well as Major General Stanislaus Graf Szeptycki (April 1917 – 28 February 1918); and the Infantry General Anton Lipošćak (1 March – 11 November 1918).

===Polish authorities===
====Council of State and Supreme National Committee====

On 14 January 1917, a Provisional Council of State () was established as a provisional government, consisting of 15 members chosen by the German and ten by the Austrian authorities. The magnate Waclaw Niemojowski was appointed &quot;Crown Marshal&quot;, with Józef Mikułowski-Pomorski acting as his deputy. Franciszek Pius Radziwiłł and Józef Piłsudski were put in charge of the Military Commission. The Council&#x27;s first proclamation espoused monarchical government, Poland&#x27;s expansion towards the east and supported an army of volunteers. A &quot;National Council&quot; served as a provisional parliament. The Councillors insisted on actual Polish autonomy and, on 21 April, were given authority over education, law courts, and propaganda. Still, students were dissatisfied with the extent of autonomy and organised a strike on 3 May, resulting in the temporary closing of all universities.

The state authorities within the Provisional Council of State (14 January – 15 August 1917) included Waclaw Niemojowski, Crown Marshall (14 January – 6 August 1917); Deputy Marshall Józef Mikułowski-Pomorski. 

Meanwhile, the Supreme National Committee continued since 1914 as the limited Polish authority in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.

====&quot;Regency&quot; constitution====
Both abovementioned bodies were dissolved after creation of the Regency Council (15 October 1917 – 14 November 1918), consisting of Archbishop Aleksander Kakowski, Prince Zdzisław Lubomirski, and Józef Ostrowski. A draft constitution was proposed in 1917. After the intermission of the Temporary Committee of the Provisional Council of State (), the Central Powers introduced a provisional constitution, the &quot;patent&quot;, on 12 September 1917. The &quot;patent&quot; devised a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament but without ministerial responsibility. Only schools and courts were transferred to Polish authorities, but — under Polish protests — the German minority was given a separate school system. Pending the election of a King of Poland, a Regency Council () was installed as a provisional government. On 18 September, the following members of the Council were named: Aleksander Kakowski, Archbishop of Warsaw; aristocrat Prince Zdzisław Lubomirski who had served as mayor of Warsaw in 1916/17; and Józef Ostrowski, a great landowner and formerly the leading Polish politician in the Russian Duma.

The Regency Council was ceremonially installed on 15 October, the anniversary of Tadeusz Kościuszko&#x27;s death, and on 26 November, appointed Jan Kucharzewski, a lawyer who had been working in the government since June, as Prime Minister. Administration, however, strictly remained in the hands of German authorities, now headed by Otto von Steinmeister. In March 1918, a resolution of the German Reichstag called for the establishment of a native civil administration in Poland, Kurland and Lithuania. However, the German authorities refused to transfer administration to Polish authorities and merely considered Poles as candidates to be trained under German supervision.
In August 1918, Achille Ratti arrived in Warsaw as an apostolic visitor to adjust the Catholic Church to the altered political circumstances. This appointment was mainly due to the influence of German Chancellor Georg von Hertling and Eugenio Pacelli, since 1917 Nuncio to Bavaria in Munich. Ratti gained fame in 1920 for being the only diplomat to stay in Warsaw during the Polish–Soviet War and was elected as Pope Pius XI in 1922.

===Armed forces and oath crisis===
Meanwhile, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s proclamation in favor of a unified and independent Poland (on 22 January 1917) and the downfall of the Emperor of Russia in the February Revolution strengthened the Polish forces favoring a neutral or pro-Entente stance.

On 21 April, the Council of State had passed a proclamation in favor of the Polish army () and appointed Colonel Sikorski to oversee recruitment. The relationship between the Central Powers and the Polish legions became increasingly difficult, especially after the powers barred Austrian subjects from the Legions (now called the Polish auxiliary corps, &quot;Polski Korpus Posilkowy&quot;), aiming to divert them into the regular Austrian army. Piłsudski agreed to serve in the government, and acted as minister of war. Piłsudski had abstained from the vote on the Polish army&#x27;s oath, and on 2 July resigned together with two left-wing State Councillors. The new army&#x27;s oath drafted by the governors-general and passed by the Council of State resulted in a political crisis, especially since it was directed to an unspecified &quot;future king&quot; and emphasized the alliance with Germany and Austria. Several legionaries refused to take the oath and were arrested, prompting General Beseler to arrest Piłsudski, his associate Kazimierz Sosnkowski, and have them confined in Germany. In August, the remains of the Legions, roughly ten thousand soldiers, were transferred to the Eastern front. Crown Marshall Niemojowski resigned on 6 August and the Council disbanded on 25 August. After the oath crisis of 1917, recruitment to the Polish army had received scant support and achieved negligible results, reaching merely 5,000 men. In May 1918, the force was strengthened by General Józef Dowbór-Muśnicki moving his Polish corps — assembled from the former Tsarist army — to Poland. In August, the legionaries arrested for refusing the oath were released and some again volunteered for the Polish army.

===Borders of the nascent state===
In their proclamation of 5 November 1916, the Central Powers refused to determine the Polish borders.

====West and North====

However, Poland&#x27;s unspecified borders were threatened in the West as well: Late in 1917, the German supreme command had proposed annexing a &quot;border strip&quot; to Germany, a policy earlier suggested by a letter to the German government by members of Poland&#x27;s German minority, settled around Łódź. Such plans were agreed to in principle by the German government in March 1918 and in April gained support in the Prussian House of Lords, but were strongly opposed by General Beseler in a report to Emperor Wilhelm.

In July, Ludendorff specified his plans in a memorandum, proposing annexing a greatly enlarged &quot;border strip&quot; of 20,000 square kilometers. In August, Emperor Charles of Austria insisted on the Austro-Polish option, forbidding Archduke Charles Stephen from accepting the crown and declaring his opposition to any German plans for annexation, but General Ludendorff reaffirmed the &quot;border strip&quot; plan, while Poles refused to yield any part of the former Kingdom of Poland.

====East and South====
Ludendorff agreed in turn to leave Wilno (and possibly Minsk) to Poland, but this did little to soothe Polish sentiment, which regarded the return of Wilno as self-evident. Moreover, Germany&#x27;s policy later shifted in favour of creating several smaller client states east of Poland, supported especially by the supreme command under Ludendorff, further heightening resistance to German presence on Polish territories. With the support of the German military, the Council of Lithuania proclaimed an independent Lithuanian state on 11 December. Polish sentiment reacted strongly, as it considered Poland and Lithuania to be a historical union and especially since it regarded Wilno (Vilnius), the proposed new Lithuanian capital, as a Polish city. Meanwhile, as it was becoming clear to Austrian politicians that the creation of a Polish state along the lines intended by Germany would result in the loss of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, they similarly proposed to award only its western part to Poland, while East Galicia and the whole of Volhynia were to be separated in order to create a Ukrainian client state. The German representative Max Hoffmann expressed a belief that &quot;independent Poland was always considered by me to be a utopia, and I have no doubts regarding my support for Ukrainian claims.&quot; This approach resulted in the signing on 9 February of the initially secret First Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Central Powers and the new state of Ukraine, which ceded to the latter the province of Chełm separated from Congress Poland by Russia in 1913. When it became public, many in Poland regarded this as a &quot;Fourth partition of Poland&quot;, prompting a &quot;political general strike&quot; in Warsaw on 14 February and the resignation of the Jan Kucharzewski administration later that month. Parts of the Polish auxiliary corps under Józef Haller protested by breaking through the Austro-Russian front line to Ukraine, where they united with Polish detachments which had left the Tsarist army. After a fierce battle with the German army at Kaniów in May, the remnants were interned, though Haller managed to escape to Moscow.

The Regency Council sought admission to the negotiation regarding the future (Second) Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Bolshevik government during travels to Berlin and Vienna early in 1918 but only gained German Chancellor Georg von Hertling&#x27;s promise to admit the Polish government in an advisory capacity. This, however, was refused by the Bolshevik representatives, who denied the Polish government any legitimacy.

==Loss of control by Central Powers and transition to republic==
After Germany&#x27;s 1918 Spring Offensive had failed to win the war on the Western front, General Ludendorff in September proposed seeking peace based on the plan outlined by U.S. President Wilson in January 1918 in his Fourteen Points, which in regard to Poland demanded the creation of an &quot;independent Polish state ... guaranteed by international covenant&quot; with &quot;free and secure access to the sea&quot;. On 3 October the new German Chancellor, Prince Max of Baden, announced Germany&#x27;s acceptance of Wilson&#x27;s plan and immediate disestablishment of military administration in the countries occupied by Germany. Three days later the Regency Council in Warsaw also adopted Wilson&#x27;s proposals as the basis for creating a Polish state. On 1 October, General Beseler had conferred with Hindenburg at Berlin and, informed of the gloomy military situation, had returned to Warsaw ill and dispirited. On 6 October, he handed over the administration to Polish civil servants. The Regency Council declared independence on 7 October 1918. On 23 October, the Regency Council installed the Świeżyński government, whom Beseler transferred the command over Polish forces (which by then included the Polish regiments of the Austro-Hungarian Army) to the Regency Council. On 4 November, the government was dismissed after an attempted coup d’état to depose the Regency Council, and was replaced by the provisional government of Władysław Wróblewski. 

However, another Polish government based in Lublin arose to challenge the Regency&#x27;s authority: on 6 November Ignacy Daszyński proclaimed the &quot;Polish People&#x27;s Republic&quot; (&quot;Tymczasowy Rząd Ludowy Republiki Polskiej&quot; - literally: &quot;Temporary People&#x27;s Government of the Polish Republic&quot;), with Daszyński himself (a Socialist politician and formerly a member of the Austrian parliament) as Prime Minister and Colonel Edward Rydz-Śmigły as a military commander. Moderates in Warsaw, who now hoped for a return of General Piłsudski, who was still held in custody at Magdeburg, repudiated Lublin&#x27;s declaration of the deposition of the Regency to be deposed and its plans for radical social reforms. Already in October, the Regency Council had requested Piłsudski&#x27;s release, and after negotiations through Harry Graf Kessler the General was allowed to return to Warsaw, where he arrived on 10 November. The following day Germany signed the armistice and German troops in Warsaw were disarmed as they refused to fire on Polish insurgents. On the same day Daszyński government ceded all authority to Piłsudski and resigned, while the Regency Council transferred to him its military authority. On 14 November the Council ceded also the remainder of its authority to Józef Piłsudski and voted itself out of existence. Already on the same day, Piłsudski issued in turn decree reappointing the [Daszyński] Government of the Polish Republic, in spite of the continued existence of Wróblewski provisional government of the Kingdom. On 16 November 1918, Piłsudski sent a radio telegram to &quot;Mr President of the United States, the Royal English Government, the Government of the French Republic, the Royal Italian Government, the Imperial Japanese Government, the Government of the German Republic, as well as the governments of all the warring or neutral states”, notifying them about the establishment of an independent Polish State, named in the telegram as the Polish Republic. 

On 17 November, both the newly designated prime minister Daszyński and the provisional government of Wróblewski resigned in favour of the new Moraczewski government, finally ending the governmental diarchy. Therefore, either 14 November or 17 November may both be considered the final day of kingdom’s existence. The transition to republican government was formally completed through the decree of 22 November 1918 on the supreme representational authority of the Polish Republic, which stipulated assumption by Piłsudski of the interim office of chief of state.

<doc id="635100" wikidata="Q1972541" url="?curid=635100" title="New Forest District">
<text>New Forest is a local government district in Hampshire, England. Its council is based in Lyndhurst, although the largest town is Totton. The district also includes the towns of Fordingbridge, Lymington, New Milton and Ringwood. The district is named after and covers most of the New Forest National Park, which occupies much of the central part of the district. The main urban areas are around the periphery of the forest. The district has a coastline onto the Solent to the south and Southampton Water to the east.

The neighbouring districts are Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, Dorset, Wiltshire, Test Valley, Southampton and Eastleigh (across Southampton Water). The district also faces the Isle of Wight across the Solent.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and most of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Lymington Municipal Borough
*New Forest Rural District
*Ringwood and Fordingbridge Rural District (except the parishes of Burton and Hurn, which went to Christchurch, and the parish of St Leonards and St Ives, which went to Wimborne)
The new district was named New Forest after the forest which covers much of the area.

New Forest is one of the most populous districts in England not to be a unitary authority; at the 2021 census only four non-unitary districts had more people. The Banham Commission had recommended that New Forest should become a unitary authority in 1995, but this was rejected by the government.

==Governance==

New Forest District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the New Forest National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the New Forest National Park Authority. The district council appoints four of its councillors to serve on the 22-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1999.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1990 (formally the chair of the policy and resources committee prior to 2001) have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 48 councillors representing 26 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The district is divided between two parliamentary constituencies: New Forest East and New Forest West.

===Premises===
The council is based at Appletree Court on Beaulieu Road in Lyndhurst. The oldest part of the building was originally a large house, which was purchased in 1954 to become the offices of the New Forest Rural District Council. The building has been substantially extended since becoming council offices.

==Towns and parishes==
The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Fordingbridge, Lymington and Pennington, New Milton, Ringwood, and Totton and Eling have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Whilst Brockenhurst and Lyndhurst are both post towns they have parish councils rather than town councils. The parishes are:
*Ashurst and Colbury
*Beaulieu
*Boldre
*Bramshaw
*Bransgore
*Breamore
*Brockenhurst
*Burley
*Copythorne
*Damerham
*Denny Lodge
*East Boldre
*Ellingham, Harbridge and Ibsley
*Exbury and Lepe
*Fawley
*Fordingbridge
*Godshill
*Hale
*Hordle
*Hyde
*Hythe and Dibden
*Lymington and Pennington
*Lyndhurst
*Marchwood
*Martin
*Milford-on-Sea
*Minstead
*Netley Marsh
*New Milton
*Ringwood
*Rockbourne
*Sandleheath
*Sopley
*Sway
*Totton and Eling
*Whitsbury
*Woodgreen

<doc id="635101" wikidata="Q2995061" url="?curid=635101" title="Twisted Metal">
<text>Twisted Metal is a series of vehicular combat video games originally developed by SingleTrac and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The series has appeared on the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3. As of October 31, 2000, the series has sold 5 million copies. Several of the games in the series were re-released as part of the Sony Greatest Hits program. The original game and its first sequel were also released for the PC.

==Overview==
Each game in the series revolves around demolitions derbies where competitors use weapons including ballistic projectiles, machine guns, and explosives. Players choose a vehicle (each with a corresponding character) and an arena—or a series of arenas in the story mode—to engage in battle with opposing drivers. The last driver alive is the winner.

The series&#x27;s plot revolves around the eponymous Twisted Metal tournament, a yearly contest made up of a series of derbies. In almost all of the games, the host is a man called &quot;Calypso&quot;; in the series&#x27; fourth installment, perennial contestant Sweet Tooth briefly takes over. The winner of the contest is granted one wish. Typically, this wish has unexpected consequences for the winner, similar to traditional stories where characters are punished for greedy wishes.

==Games==

===Main games===
====&quot;Twisted Metal&quot; (1995) and &quot;Twisted Metal 2&quot; (1996)====

The first two &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; games were developed by SingleTrac.

Windows versions of &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; and &quot;Twisted Metal 2&quot; exist. &quot;Twisted Metal 2&quot; on PC is built on an earlier version of the game (minor details of some levels disappeared) but it doesn&#x27;t require a 3D accelerator video card and played well on computers with lower processing capabilities. It also features multiplayer over a modem line or Internet.

====&quot;Twisted Metal III&quot; (1998) and &quot;Twisted Metal 4&quot; (1999)====

Both games were developed and published by 989 Studios due to SingleTrac&#x27;s dispute with Sony and sale to GT Interactive rendered them unable to develop more Twisted Metal games. David Jaffe, in speaking about these two entries in the series, was reported to have said, &quot;...[in and of themselves] they&#x27;re good games, they&#x27;re just not good &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; games&quot;.

====&quot;Twisted Metal: Black&quot; (2001)====
After developing several non-&quot;Twisted Metal&quot; vehicular combat games for GT Interactive, a large number of SingleTrac employees left the company to form the gaming studio Incog Inc. Entertainment, and signed with Sony to develop another installment of the series on the PlayStation 2, &quot;Twisted Metal: Black&quot;. It serves as a reboot for the series, with returning characters having drastically changed appearances alongside newcomers.

====&quot;Twisted Metal: Head-On&quot; (2005)====
Despite what was essentially a complete relaunch and rebranding of the franchise with &quot;Twisted Metal: Black&quot;, Incognito decided to return to the series&#x27; roots and create a game that felt more like a true follow-up to the original &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; series, bringing back the bright colors and cartoony characters of &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; 1 and 2. Available on the PSP in time for its North American launch and utilizing the PSP&#x27;s built-in online capabilities, it also marked the first time a &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; game had full online play available from the start.

====&quot;Twisted Metal: Head-On: Extra Twisted Edition&quot; (2008)====
In February 2008, Eat Sleep Play, a new development studio formed by David Jaffe and Scott Campbell, released &quot;Twisted Metal: Head-On&quot; for the PlayStation 2. While primarily a direct port of the PSP game &quot;Twisted Metal: Head-On&quot;, it does feature a number of extra features, most notably four complete and playable levels from the unreleased/incomplete &quot;Twisted Metal: Black&quot; sequel, called &quot;Twisted Metal: Harbor City&quot;. Other bonus content includes: a code to download the soundtrack (a timed offer which has since expired); a half-hour documentary on the series with some of the original developers called &quot;Dark Past&quot;; a rough playable portion of an unfinished and unreleased third person action game starring Sweet Tooth (controllable for the first time ever on-foot and outside of a vehicle); and the never before seen original live-action ending videos of all the characters from the first &quot;Twisted Metal&quot;, directed by Jaffe.

====&quot;Twisted Metal&quot; (2012)====
&quot;Twisted Metal&quot; (2012) is the most recent game in the &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; series. It features multiple drivers and tracks. It also features multiplayer gameplay and other game modes. The game consists of three story arcs that focus on Sweet Tooth, Mr. Grimm and Dollface.

===Spin-off games===
====&quot;Twisted Metal: Small Brawl&quot; (2001)====

Instead of delivering a PlayStation 2 follow-up to &quot;Twisted Metal: Black&quot;, Incognito took an unexpected turn and developed &quot;Twisted Metal: Small Brawl&quot; for the original PlayStation, a &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; aimed at a younger audience that featured radio-controlled toy cars instead of full-size vehicles.

====&quot;Twisted Metal: Black Online&quot; (2002)====
Platform: PlayStation 2

A game featuring only the multiplayer portion of &quot;Twisted Metal: Black&quot;, but playable online. A free copy could originally be obtained by mailing in a card that came packaged with the PlayStation 2 online network adapter. After Sony stopped offering the disc, it was later included as a bonus disc in subsequent reissues of the Greatest Hits version of &quot;Twisted Metal: Black&quot;. The official servers to the game have since been shut down, but unofficial fan-hosted servers are available to join as of 2023.

===Cancelled games===
====&quot;Twisted Metal: Harbor City&quot;====

A sequel to the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Twisted Metal: Black&quot;, titled &quot;Twisted Metal: Harbor City&quot;, was in development but was cancelled before it was announced when the series co-creators left the development team. At the time of cancellation four levels had been completed; these levels were included in &quot;Twisted Metal Head-On: Extra Twisted Edition&quot; as part of &quot;Twisted Metal: Lost&quot;.

====&quot;Twisted Metal: Apocalypse&quot;====
A &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; game set in a post-apocalyptic environment, which was originally in development in 2008 but was scrapped. Artwork of the cancelled game was released by David Jaffe at San Diego Comic-Con; it showcased concept arts of locations such as a destroyed Mount Rushmore as well as a giant crater. Eat Sleep Play team was originally rather keen on the idea, though it was hinted by Jaffe that the idea was rejected by Sony Computer Entertainment, speculated to be because of the release of &quot;&quot;, a racing game which also featured a post-apocalyptic environment.

====&quot;Twisted Metal: Revolution&quot;====
Apart from &quot;Twisted Metal: Apocalypse&quot;, another &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; game was in development for the PlayStation 3 which utilized street culture and hip-hop influence. The game was titled &quot;Twisted Metal: Revolution&quot;, but it was cancelled; it would have featured characters with a more realistic look such as a Sweet Tooth that looked more of a smooth criminal rather than a psychopathic clown. Other characters included Yakuza, FBI agents and street gang members. David Jaffe compared the game to Rockstar&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Club&quot; series when describing the look and feel of the game. In addition, Jaffe said that it was extremely difficult to portray the environments that they had created in their concept art within the game as it resulted in an extremely bland environment.

==== &quot;Twisted Metal (Live-Service)&quot; ====
Unnamed live-service &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; game cancelled early on in its development. It was originally supposed to be made by the UK-based studio Luden Games, but was later handed to Firesprite. Not much is known about it and the game was never greenlit, but it was to be released on the PS5. The reason for the cancellation was the lay off 900 employees worldwide.

==Other media==
===Comic book===
A one-shot &quot;Twisted Metal 2&quot; comic book was published by DC Comics in 1996, written by Jamie Delano, pencilled by Phil Hester and inked by Peter Gross. The comic was given out as a prize in a promotional contest held in the &quot;Tips &amp; Tricks&quot; magazine.

===Cancelled film adaptation===
In February 2012, Sony Pictures Entertainment was bringing &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; to theaters by hiring Brian Taylor to write and direct the film. Five years later in September, Brian Taylor confirmed that Sony had passed on the &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; film, feeling the series fanbase did not warrant the higher budget it would have cost to realize it.

&quot;Twisted Metal&quot; was the inspiration for &quot;Slaughter Race&quot;, a fictional video game featured in the Disney animated film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; (2018).

===Television adaptation===

In March 2019, Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman and CEO Tony Vinciquerra spoke about developing a television adaptation of the &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; franchise, during a presentation for investors at a special event. According to Vinciquerra, his division will be working closely with his acquaintances at the PlayStation division through a brand new production team created solely with the purpose of helping Sony produce filming television projects based on their gaming IPs. In February 2021, a &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; TV series was moving forward, with Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick helping to develop the series, with Michael Jonathan Smith writing the series and executive producing the series alongside Will Arnett, Reese, Wernick, Marc Forman, Peter Principato, Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, and Herman Hulst. Later in September, Anthony Mackie was announced in the role of John Doe, and later officially confirmed to be starring and executive producing the series, which had been given a series order at Peacock. In May 2022, Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church and Neve Campbell joined the cast. Will Arnett was hired to voice Sweet Tooth in June, with Samoa Joe playing the dual role. Mike Mitchell plays Stu, Mike&#x27;s best friend, played by Tahj Vaughans. Lou Beatty Jr. plays a character named Tommy. The 10-episode series was released on Peacock on July 27, 2023.

<doc id="635105" wikidata="Q6149709" url="?curid=635105" title="José Castillo (infielder)">
<text>José Castillo Rondón (; March 19, 1981 – December 6, 2018) was a Venezuelan professional baseball infielder. He played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, San Francisco Giants, and Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Chiba Lotte Marines and Yokohama BayStars of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He was killed in a car crash in 2018 in Venezuela, caused by bandits in an attempted robbery.

==Professional career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On July 2, 1997, Castillo signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization as an international free agent. He made his professional debut in 1999 with the GCL Pirates. In 2000, he spent the year in Single-A with the Hickory Crawdads, slashing .299/.346/.480 with 16 home runs and 72 RBI. The next year, he played for the High-A Lynchburg Hillcats, where he slashed .248/.288/.359 in 125 games. He remained in Lynchburg for the 2002 season, batting .300/.370/.453 with 16 home runs and 81 RBI in 134 games. He played with the Double-A Altoona Curve in 2003, hitting .287/.339/.390 with 5 home runs and 66 RBI.

Castillo was named the fourth-best prospect in the Pirates organization by &quot;Baseball America&quot; following the 2003 season, and he also ranked as the top Pittsburgh prospect by &quot;USA Today Sports Weekly&quot;.

In 2003, Castillo was both the starting shortstop for the World Team in Major League Baseball&#x27;s All-Star Futures Game and an All-Star in the Double-A Eastern League.

In his rookie season, Castillo impressed the Pirates&#x27; front office with his defensive plays. In the field, he displayed good range and a very strong arm in 2004, even better than the Pirates expected from a former shortstop. At the plate, however, his play was more typical of a 22-year-old who had never played in Triple-A. Except for hot streaks in April and August, Castillo did not hit for average or power and was not very selective at the plate, striking out with regularity (even if not quite as often as some of his teammates) and walking very little despite hitting in front of the pitcher for most of the season. However, his power potential was apparent from the fact that the majority of his extra base hits and home runs were hit the opposite way—including a blast to center field on July 5, 2004, at Pro Player Stadium – and his minor league statistics indicated that his plate discipline should improve. He finished with eight home runs, 39 RBI and a .256 batting average, despite missing two months on the disabled list. Because of his defense and high ceiling, he entered 2005 as the Pirates&#x27; starting second baseman.

2005 was a trying season for Castillo. He was on the disabled list for most of April with a strained left oblique muscle. In late August, he tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee during a game against the St. Louis Cardinals and missed the rest of the season.

Despite the injuries, Castillo showed progress both defensively and at the plate when he did play. In the field, he and shortstop Jack Wilson were largely responsible for the Pirates turning more double plays than any National League team except the Cardinals. At the same time, Castillo hit .268 with 11 homers and 53 RBI, significantly improving his power production while cutting down heavily on his strikeouts (from 92 in 383 at bats in 2004 to 59 in 370 at bats in 2005). The Pirates expected Castillo to be 100% for the start of spring training in February 2006, though he was not able to play winter ball in his native Venezuela.

Castillo was the Pirates&#x27; starting second baseman in almost every game in 2006. After a slow April, Castillo was among the best hitters in all of the majors in May, culminating in his &quot;Player of the Week&quot; award for the last week in May, during which he led the NL in RBI, total bases, slugging percentage, and home runs.

The 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Pittsburgh, and Castillo finished third among NL second basemen in the All-Star voting behind Chase Utley and Craig Biggio. Castillo&#x27;s teammates Jason Bay and Freddy Sanchez represented the Pirates in the All-Star Game that year.

But after a promising start, Castillo struggled down the stretch of the 2006 season. In the 92 games since homering seven times in a two-week span in May, Castillo hit only six home runs. He snapped an 0–23 hitting slump on September 23 against the Padres, but had been benched for three consecutive games before that. By the end of the season, his batting average had fallen to .253. His signature excellent defense was also missing at times in 2006, he committed a team high 18 errors. Castillo finished September batting only .087 for the month and did not start in several games.

He finished the 2006 season with 14 home runs, 65 RBI, 131 hits, and 25 doubles to go along with his .253 batting average.

Despite rumors he might be traded in the off-season, the Pirates elected to keep Castillo. With the emergence of infielders Freddy Sanchez and José Bautista, Castillo entered spring training with his role on the team uncertain.
Castillo entered spring training slimmed down and had a stellar spring. But on March 23, the Pirates announced that José Bautista would start the season as the team&#x27;s starting third baseman, meaning Castillo would start the season as a utility bench player. Though with Freddy Sanchez nursing an injury, Castillo started at second base for the first five games of the season.

Through May and June, Castillo had received few starts and minimal pinch hit appearances. Though he received praise from manager Jim Tracy about his attitude after being left on the bench, Castillo&#x27;s agent asked the Pirates to trade him due to poor playing time. With the team, and notably starting shortstop Jack Wilson, struggling, there was speculation Castillo could find his way into a starting role, or at least see his appearances become more regular. 2007 closed a disappointing season for Castillo. He played in only slightly over half of the team&#x27;s games, and many of his appearances were as a pinch hitter rather than a starter. He never got into an offensive groove and finished with a .244 batting average, 24 RBI, and no home runs. He was released by the club on December 6.

<doc id="635107" wikidata="Q613878" url="?curid=635107" title="Maldon District">
<text>Maldon District is a local government district in Essex, England. The district is managed by &quot;Maldon District Council&quot;, which is based in Maldon, the largest town in the district. The district also includes the town of Burnham-on-Crouch and numerous villages, including Heybridge, Wickham Bishops, Southminster, Tolleshunt D&#x27;Arcy and Tollesbury. The district covers the Dengie peninsula to the south of Maldon and the Thurstable Hundred area to the north of the Blackwater Estuary, a total area of 358.78 km2.

The majority of people live in the small rural villages, many of which have their origins in connections with the coast or agricultural economy. The district has a long association with sailing, as is referenced in the council&#x27;s logo.
==Administrative history==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Burnham-on-Crouch Urban District
*Maldon Municipal Borough
*Maldon Rural District

The new district was named Maldon after its largest town.

==Governance==
Maldon district is a non-metropolitan district, with Maldon District Council forming the middle layer of a three-tier structure of local government. Above the district level, Essex County Council provides county-level services. At the lower level the district is divided into civil parishes.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2020. The council remained under no overall control following the 2023 election.

The first election to Maldon District Council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2006 have been:
Former leader of Maldon district council John Smith, who led the council between 1991 and 1993, was killed along with two family members while he commanded a light aircraft flight from Oban bound for Andrewsfield, Essex on 9 April 2007.

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and one subsequent change of allegiance in June 2023, the composition of the council was:

Of the independent councillors, six form the &quot;District Support Group&quot; and the other three do not belong to a group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Princes Road in Maldon. The original building was previously an orphanage called &quot;The Retreat&quot;, which had been purchased in 1939 by the Maldon Rural District Council for £4,500. Large extensions were added in the 1980s to the north and south of the original building.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2003, the council has comprised 31 councillors elected from 17 wards. Elections are held every four years.

The area is part of the parliamentary constituency of Maldon.

== History ==

The first evidence of a settlement to the north of Maldon at Elms Farm is from the Middle Bronze Age 3500 years ago. From 500 BC onwards the red hills of the Crouch and Blackwater show us that there was a continuous and extensive activity in the salt making which still prospers today.

Later, during the Iron Age, about 100 BC, there was a port, set among the marshlands at the junction of the Blackwater and Chelmer rivers. This settlement may have been of regional religious significance, and there is evidence that it traded luxury goods with Europe.

Elms Farm continued as a port and market place but was clearly superseded in importance by Colchester in the 1st century AD, when Colchester became the first capital of the Roman administration.

The Romans founded Othona in the 3rd century. It was a Saxon Shore fort at the mouth of the Blackwater, built to protect the estuary from Saxon pirates. It was here in 654 AD that St Cedd founded the church of St Peter-on-the-Wall, the oldest church in England to retain much of its original fabric.

In 664 AD St Cedd attended the Synod of Whitby which merged the Anglo-Celtic Church with the Church of Rome. Recent changes in the coastline have revealed the remains of extensive Saxon 5-7th century fish traps. The Church stands today overlooking the North Sea from whence came further invaders in the 10th century - the Danes.

In 912 AD and 914 AD King Edward the Elder camped at Maldon to organise defences in the desperate fight against the Danes. In 917 AD the Saxons were defeated at Colchester and besieged at Maldon, but eventually, the Danes were defeated.

In 991 AD there was a major battle between the pillaging Danes led by Olaf Trygvassen who had already attacked Ipswich, and Earl Byrhtnoth’s men who were defending Maldon on the instruction of the Saxon King Æthelred the Unready. Earl Byrhtnoth was in his sixties. The battle was recorded in a poem which is regarded as one of the finest examples of early English literature.

The famous Battle of Maldon took place beside the River Blackwater on 10 August 991, during the reign of Æthelred the Unready. The Anglo-Saxons, led by Byrhtnoth and his thegns, fought against a Viking invasion, a battle which ended in defeat for the Anglo-Saxons.

==Geology, landscape and ecology==
The district is in the east of Essex (). Most of the district is the Dengie peninsula. Still, a significant area is also the area above the Blackwater Estuary, bounded by the River Blackwater to the west until near Kelvedon, the boundary then continues south of Tiptree to the Salcott inlet on the Blackwater Estuary. There are very few settlements on the boundary of the district with the North Sea, in contrast with other coastal districts of Essex, due to the Dengie Marshes.

The district has a rural character ranging from the tidal salt marshes to farmland and rolling wooded ridges. A network of country lanes provides access to the countryside from the towns and villages. A remote area of tidal mud-flats and saltmarshes at the eastern end of the Dengie peninsula forms the Dengie Special Protection Area. The River Blackwater and River Crouch are of international importance for nature conservation particularly for their extensive population of wildfowl and waders.

==Parishes==
The district is divided into 34 civil parishes. In Burnham-on-Crouch and Maldon, the parish councils operate under the name &quot;Town Council&quot;. In addition, some of the parishes share a grouped parish council, meaning there are just 31 parish councils. The current parishes are:

*Althorne
*Asheldham
*Bradwell-on-Sea
*Burnham-on-Crouch (Town)
*Cold Norton

<text>Rhos-on-Sea () is a seaside resort and community in Conwy County Borough, Wales. The population was 7,593 at the 2011 census. It adjoins Colwyn Bay and is named after the Welsh kingdom of Rhos established there in late Roman Britain as a sub-kingdom of Gwynedd. It later became a &quot;cantref&quot; (hundred).

==History==
===Bryn Euryn and Llys Euryn===
Bryn Euryn is a hill overlooking Rhos-on-Sea on which there are the remains of a hillfort called Dinerth, the &#x27;fort of the bear&#x27;, and a limestone quarry. Ednyfed Fychan, 13th century seneschal to Llywelyn the Great and ancestor to the House of Tudor was granted the land and built a castle on the hill, of which all traces have disappeared, and a manor, Llys Euryn of which the ruins of its 15th-century reconstruction can be seen today.

===Church of Llandrillo yn Rhos===

Llandrillo yn Rhos Church was built on the site of Ednyfed Fychan&#x27;s private chapel and incorporates what was his tombstone, the history of this church goes back to the 13th century, but having been rebuilt over the centuries, the oldest parts of the present church are 15th century. A major restoration was carried out in 1857 and was criticised by some for amounting to &#x27;vandalism&#x27;, in particular the destruction of an ancient stained glass window. Nevertheless, it remains one of the most important historic buildings in North Wales.

The stone lych-gate was built in 1677 and is one of the oldest in the district; the sundial is from the early 18th century.

The graveyard here contains the grave of Harold Lowe, an officer on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. He was widely regarded as a hero, helping many to safety with cool nerve and bravery. It also contains war graves of eight service personnel, two of World War I and six of World War II.

===Rhos Fynach===
In 1186 Llywelyn the Great permitted the establishment of the Cistercian Aberconwy Abbey, and the monks built a fishing weir on the sea shore below Bryn Euryn. The place became known as Rhos Fynach, &quot;heath of the monks&quot;. In a charter of 1230, Llywelyn sanctioned the purchase by Ednyfed Fychan of land at Rhos Fynach and in 1289, the abbey moved to Maenan (becoming Maenan Abbey), and the weir was ceded to Ednyfed&#x27;s estate. Eventually Rhos Fynach and the weir came into the hands of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who in 1575 granted it to a Captain Morgan ap John ap David, a privateer, for services rendered against the enemies of Queen Elizabeth I at sea. (This is not the famous pirate of the Caribbean Captain Henry Morgan who lived in the century following).

The weir continued to provide a prosperous livelihood through to the early 20th century: during a single night in 1850, 35,000 herring were caught, and 10 tons of mackerel were removed in one tide as late as 1907. Because such weirs decimated inshore fish stocks, Parliament banned them in 1861 unless it could be shown they pre-dated the Magna Carta, which the then owners, the Parry Evans family, were able to prove. Their estate included Rhos Fynach house, also known as Rhos Farm, on the Promenade near St Trillo&#x27;s Chapel. The house is now a pub and restaurant. Its date of construction is not known for sure, but it is considered to have been started by the Cistercians before the dissolution of the monasteries.

The fishing weir fell into disuse during World War I and most traces have disappeared. Trial excavation of the site in 1993 recorded constructions carbon 14-dated between 1500 and 1660.

===St Trillo&#x27;s Chapel===
The 6th-century St Trillo&#x27;s Chapel (), which was the mother church of a large parish which included places as far apart as Eglwysbach and Eglwys Rhos (&quot;Llan Rhos&quot;).

The chapel by the sea is on the site of a pre-Christian, sacred holy well; the altar is built directly over the pure water of the well. Saint Trillo, the son of Ithel Hael from Llydaw (Brittany) also founded a church at Llandrillo in Denbighshire. Trillo&#x27;s brother Tygai (Llandygai) founded a church near Penrhyn, Bangor; their sister Llechid founded a church (Llanllechid) in the uplands above Penrhyn.

===Trams===
The Llandudno and Colwyn Bay Electric Railway operated an electric tramway service between Llandudno and Rhos-on-Sea from 1907 and extended to Colwyn Bay in 1908. The service closed in 1956.

==Other features==
*Rhos-on-Sea also has the first permanent puppet theatre to be built in Britain, the Harlequin Puppet Theatre, which opened on 7 July 1958, when it won the Civic Trust Award for its design. Founders Eric Bramall and Chris Somerville have also created many puppet programmes for BBC children&#x27;s television over a forty-year period. Many of the puppets created for these television series are now on display at the National Trust property of Penrhyn Castle.
*Coleg Llandrillo Cymru, the former Llandrillo Technical College
*Ysgol Llandrillo yn Rhos, a mixed county primary day school
*The Society of St. Pius X operates a Traditionalist Catholic chapel in a renovated Methodist church on Conwy Road.

==Governance==
The community boundaries are coterminous with the electoral ward of Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, which elects four county councillors to Conwy County Borough Council.

Rhos-on-Sea is also divided into two community wards, of Rhos and Dinarth. Rhos elects up to five councillors and Dinarth elects up to three councillors to the Bay of Colwyn Town Council (which was formed in 1996).

== Sport ==
Colwyn Bay Cricket Club was founded in 1923 and started playing at Penrhyn Avenue, Rhos on Sea in 1924. Glamorgan Cricket has been hosted here since the 1960s.

==Notable people==
* According to legend, Madog ap Owain Gwynedd, a Welsh prince of Gwynedd, sailed from here in 1170 and discovered America, over three hundred years before Christopher Columbus&#x27;s famous voyage in 1492. This event was recorded by a plaque on one of the properties on the sea-front. This property was called &quot;Odstone&quot; at no. 179, Marine Drive which, as of June 2012, had become neglected. It was demolished as of September 2017.

* The poet and visual artist David Jones visited Rhos-on-Sea in 1904 when he was 9. It was his first ever trip to Wales and it made an enormous impression on him. His father&#x27;s family lived in Rhos, and the young Jones played with his cousins at St. Trillo&#x27;s Chapel, and on Bryn Euryn. He also particularly loved the fishing weir just a few yards from St. Trillos. These were formative influences both on his writing and visual art. He wrote that this visit left &#x27;an indelible mark on my soul&#x27;.

:In 1937, after the death of his mother, Jones revisited Rhos. He found it a &#x27;wilderness of villas and bungalows&#x27;. The fishing weir had gone (there remain a few stumps), and the chapel was now &#x27;cleared and cared for&#x27;, but it had &#x27;lost half its numinous feeling&#x27;.

*Harold Lowe 5th officer of Titanic, is buried at Llandrillo-yn-Rhos churchyard
*Thérèse Coffey MP [Con., Suffolk Coastal, 2010–present] was partly educated in Rhos-on-Sea
* Llewelyn Wyn Griffith, author of &quot;Up to Mametz&quot;, born 1890
* Wilf Wooller, Welsh rugby international, Glamorgan cricketer and Cardiff City footballer, was born here.

<text>Lord Edward&#x27;s Crusade, sometimes called the Ninth Crusade, was a military expedition to the Holy Land under the command of Edward, Duke of Gascony (later king as Edward I) in 1271–1272. In practice an extension of the Eighth Crusade, it was the last of the Crusades to reach the Holy Land before the fall of Acre in 1291 brought an end to the permanent crusader presence there.

The crusade saw Edward clash with the Egyptian Mamluk sultan Baibars, with both achieving limited victories. The Crusaders were ultimately forced to withdraw since Edward had pressing concerns at home and felt unable to resolve the internal conflicts within the remnant Outremer territories. It also foreshadowed the imminent collapse of the last remaining crusader strongholds along the Mediterranean coast.

==From Dover to Acre==
Following the Mamluk victory over the Mongols in 1260 at the Battle of Ain Jalut by Qutuz and his general Baibars, Qutuz was assassinated, leaving Baibars to claim the sultanate for himself. As sultan, Baibars proceeded to attack the Christian crusaders at Arsuf, Atlit, Haifa, Safad, Jaffa, Ascalon, and Caesarea. As the Crusader fortress cities fell one by one, the Christians sought help from Europe, but assistance was slow in coming.

In 1268, Baibars captured Antioch, thereby destroying the last remnant of the Principality of Antioch, securing the Mamluk northern front and threatening the small Crusader County of Tripoli. With royal and papal approval, Edward &quot;took the cross&quot; on 24 June 1268. Louis IX of France organized a large crusader army with the intent of attacking Egypt, but diverted it instead to Tunis. Louis himself died there in 1270. He had loaned Edward 70,000 &quot;livres tournois&quot; for his crusade.

Edward and his brother Edmund prepared an expedition to join Louis at Tunis, but it was delayed several times in the summer of 1270 because their father, King Henry III of England, could not make up his mind whether to join it or not. On the advice of his councilors, he opted to stay in England and the crusaders embarked at Dover on 20 August. Unusual for the time, they were accompanied by Edward&#x27;s wife Eleanor of Castile throughout.

Edward traveled slowly through France, arriving in Aigues-Mortes, the same port from which Louis had embarked, in late September (a month later than expected). He went from there to Sardinia, where he waited a month before crossing to Tunis, where he arrived on 10 November, too late for the fighting. In fact, the Treaty of Tunis that ended the crusade had been signed on 30 October. Although Edward had played no role in its negotiation, the treaty obligated its signatories—Philip III of France, Charles I of Sicily and Theobald II of Navarre—to prevent Edward from attacking Tunis. Edward was also excluded from receiving a portion of the indemnity paid to the crusaders for leaving.

On 18 November, Charles granted Edward a safe-conduct allowing him to stay in Sicily while contemplating his next steps. Although the other crusaders decided each to return home, Edward opted to continue on his way to the Holy Land to assist Bohemund VI, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli, against the Mamluk threat to the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. On May 9, 1271 Edward finally arrived at Acre with a fleet of eight sailing vessels and thirty galleys. He brought a small but not insignificant contingent of no more than 1,000 men, including 225 knights.

==Operations in the Holy Land==
Edward arrived at Acre while it was still under siege. His arrival caused Baibars to change his plans and turn away from Acre. In the meantime, Edward discovered that the Venetians had a flourishing trade with the Mamluks, providing the latter with timber and metal needed for armaments. In addition, they controlled the slave-trade along with the Genoese, in which they carried Turkish and Tartar slaves from the Black Sea ports to Egypt. However, he could not prevent such businesses, as they had licenses from the High Court at Acre.

===Crusader raids===
The forces under Edward&#x27;s command were much too small to take on the Mamluks in a straight battle, being unable to even stop the Mamluks from seizing the nearby Teutonic Montfort Castle. They settled for launching a series of raids. After capturing Nazareth, Edward raided St Georges-de-Lebeyne but accomplished little other than burning some houses and crops, on top of losing a few men to the heat.

Later, the arrival of additional forces from England and Hugh III of Cyprus, under the command of Edward&#x27;s younger brother Edmund, emboldened Edward. He launched a larger raid with the support of the Templar, Hospitaller, and Teutonic Knights on the town of Qaqun. The Crusaders surprised a large force of Turcomans (mostly itinerant herdsmen), reportedly killing 1,500 of them and taking 5,000 animals as booty. These Turcomans were likely relatively new additions to Baibars&#x27; army, being integrated in 1268 and given horses, titles, and lands in return for military service after the Turkmen migrations following the Mongol invasions. Muslim sources list one emir as killed and one as wounded during this raid. On top of that, the Muslim commander of the castle was forced to abandon his command. However, Edward did not take the castle itself and retreated before Baibars could respond in kind (he was with his main army in Aleppo at the time, guarding against the Mongol raid).

In December 1271, Edward and his troops saw some action when they repelled an attack by Baibars on the city of Acre. Baibars eventually abandoned his siege of Tripoli, but the exact reason is not known. Contemporary accounts state that Edward&#x27;s attacks on Baibars&#x27; interior lines forced him to abandon the siege. Some modern observers reject this interpretation, saying he instead abandoned it to avoid overcommitting himself in one direction due to a lack of intelligence on the Crusaders&#x27; true capabilities.

===Mongol raids===
As soon as Edward arrived in Acre, he made some attempts to form a Franco-Mongol alliance, sending an embassy to the Mongol ruler of Persia, Abagha, an enemy of the Muslims. The embassy was led by Reginald Rossel, Godefroi of Waus and John of Parker, and its mission was to obtain military support from the Mongols. In an answer dated 4 September 1271, Abagha agreed on cooperation and asked on what date the concerted attack on the Mamluks should take place.

At the end of October 1271, a Mongol army arrived in Syria. However Abagha, occupied by other conflicts in Turkestan could only send 10,000 horsemen under general Samagar, a force made up of the occupation army in Seljuk Anatolia and auxiliary Seljukid troops. Despite the relatively small force, their arrival still triggered an exodus of Muslim populations (who remembered the previous campaigns of Kitbuqa) as far south as Cairo. The Mongols defeated the Mamluk Turcoman troops that protected Aleppo, and raided southwards, sending the other garrisons fleeing for Hama, and devastating the lands down to Apamea. But the Mongols did not stay, and when the Mamluk leader Baibars mounted a counter-offensive from Egypt on 12 November the Mongols had already retreated beyond the Euphrates, laden with booty.

===Naval campaign off Cyprus===
In the interim, Baibars came to suspect there would be a combined land-sea attack on Egypt. Feeling his position sufficiently threatened, he endeavoured to head off such a manoeuvre by building a fleet. Having finished construction of the fleet, rather than attack the Crusader army directly, Baibars attempted to land on Cyprus in 1271, hoping to draw Hugh III of Cyprus (the nominal king of Jerusalem) and his fleet out of Acre, with the objective of conquering the island and leaving Edward and the crusader army isolated in the Holy Land. He disguised 17 war galleys as Christian vessels and attacked Limassol. However, in the ensuing naval campaign the fleet was destroyed off the coast of Limassol and Baibars&#x27; armies were forced back.

===End of the Crusade===
Following this victory, Edward realized that to create a force capable of retaking Jerusalem it would be necessary to end the internal unrest within the Christian state, and so he mediated between Hugh and his unenthusiastic knights from the Ibelin family of Cyprus. In parallel to the mediation, Edward and Hugh began negotiating a truce with Baibars; a 10-year-10-month-and-10-day agreement was reached in May 1272, at Caesarea. Almost immediately Edmund departed for England, while Edward remained to see if the treaty would hold. The following month, an attempt to assassinate Edward was made, of uncertain origin. According to different versions, the assassin was sent by the emir of Ramlah or by Baibars. Some legends also say that the assassin was sent by the Hashshashin leader, the &quot;Old Man of the Mountains&quot;. Edward killed the assassin but received a festering wound from a poisoned dagger, further delaying his departure. In September 1272, Edward departed Acre for Sicily and, while recuperating on the island, he first received news of the death of his son John, and then a few months later news of the death of his father, Henry III of England. In 1273 Edward started his homeward journey via Italy, Gascony and Paris. Edward finally reached England in the middle of 1274, and was crowned King of England on 19 August 1274.

==Aftermath==

Edward had been accompanied by Theobald Visconti, who became Pope Gregory X in 1271. Gregory called for a new crusade at the Council of Lyons in 1274, but nothing came of this. Meanwhile, new fissures arose within the Christian states when Charles of Anjou took advantage of a dispute between Hugh III, the Knights Templar, and the Venetians to bring the remaining Christian state under his control. Having bought Mary of Antioch&#x27;s claims to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, he attacked Hugh III, causing a civil war within the rump kingdom. In 1277, Roger of San Severino captured Acre for Charles.

Although the crusaders&#x27; internecine war was debilitating, it offered the possibility of unified control of the crusade under Charles. However, this hope was dashed when Venice suggested a crusade be called not against the Mamluks but against Constantinople, where Michael VIII had recently re-established the Byzantine Empire and driven out the Venetians. Pope Gregory would not have supported such an attack, but in 1281 Pope Martin IV assented to it; the ensuing fiasco helped lead to the Sicilian Vespers on 31 March 1282, instigated by Michael VIII, and Charles was forced to return home. This was the last crusader expedition launched against the Byzantines in Europe or the Muslims in the Holy Land.

The remaining nine years saw an increase in demands from the Mamluks, including tribute, as well as increased persecution of pilgrims, all in contravention of the truce. In 1289, Sultan Qalawun gathered a large army and invested the remnants of the county of Tripoli. He ultimately laid siege to the capital and took it after a bloody assault. The attack on Tripoli however was particularly devastating to the Mamluks as the Christian resistance reached fanatical proportions and Qalawun lost his eldest and most able son in the campaign. He waited another two years to regather his strength.

In 1275, Abaqa sent a messenger to Edward with a letter. Abaqa requested that Edward mobilize for another Crusade, saying he could offer more help this time. Edward wrote back the same year, thanking Abaqa for his help in the Ninth Crusade while also noting his affection for Christianity. He said he did not know when there would be another Crusade, but was eager to get back to the Holy Land, and would inform Abaqa if the Pope declared another. The letter was almost certainly a formality, as Edward made no preparations for another Crusade. In 1276, another envoy was sent to Edward with the same message, with an additional message of apology for not effectively intervening in 1271.

In 1291, a group of pilgrims from Acre came under attack and in retaliation killed nineteen Muslim merchants in a Syrian caravan. Qalawun demanded they pay an extraordinary amount in compensation. When no reply came, the Sultan used it as a pretext to besiege Acre and finish off the last independent Crusader state occupying the Holy Land. Qalawun died during the siege, leaving Khalil, the sole surviving member of his family, as Mamluk Sultan. With Acre seized, the Crusader States other than Cyprus ceased to exist. The center of power of the Crusaders was moved northwards to Tortosa and eventually offshore to Cyprus. In 1299, a Mongol army led by Ghazan Khan led a series of successful raids against the Mamluks in an area northeast of Homs to as far south as Gaza. He finally withdrew from Syria in 1300. The Mongols and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia led another campaign to recapture Syria, but were soon defeated by the Mamluks at the Battle of Shaqhab in 1303. The last remaining foothold on the Holy Land, Ruad Island, was lost by 1303. The period of the Crusades to the Holy Land was over, 208 years after the beginning of the First Crusade.

<text>The Borough of Wellingborough was a non-metropolitan district and borough in Northamptonshire, England, from 1974 to 2021. It was named after Wellingborough, its main town, but also included surrounding rural areas.

The local council preferred to call itself the &quot;Borough Council of Wellingborough&quot; rather than the more usual form &quot;Wellingborough Borough Council&quot;.

The borough covered almost the same area as the Wellingborough constituency. It was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the borough of Wellingborough with Wellingborough Rural District.

The borough bordered the districts of South Northamptonshire, Northampton, Kettering, Daventry and East Northamptonshire, as well as Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, and Bedford in Bedfordshire.

==Abolition and replacement==
In March 2018, following suspension of the County Council arising from its becoming insolvent, due to financial and cultural mismanagement by the cabinet and officers, the then Secretary of State for Local Government, Sajid Javid, sent commissioner Max Caller into the council, who recommended the county council and all district and borough councils in the county be abolished, and replaced by two unitary authorities, one covering the West, and one the North of the county. These proposals were approved in April 2019. It meant that the districts of Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire were merged to form a new unitary authority called West Northamptonshire, whilst the second unitary authority North Northamptonshire consists of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough districts. These new authorities came into being on 1 April 2021. Elections for the new authorities were due to be held on 7 May 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Concurrent with these changes, the unparished area of Wellingborough was established as a civil parish and gained a Town Council.

==Settlements and parishes==

Other than Wellingborough itself the borough included:

*Bozeat
*Earls Barton
*Easton Maudit
*Ecton
*Finedon
*Great Doddington
*Great Harrowden
*Grendon
*Hardwick
*Irchester 
*Isham
*Little Harrowden, 
*Little Irchester
*Mears Ashby
*Orlingbury
*Strixton
*Sywell
*Wilby
*Wollaston

<doc id="635116" wikidata="Q5099270" url="?curid=635116" title="Chilworth, Hampshire">
<text>Chilworth is a village in the Test Valley district of Hampshire, England, on the northern edge of Southampton. Good travel connections and restricted development have led to the village becoming particularly affluent. The village was referred to as Celeworda in the Domesday Book of 1086, and is now in two parts: modern Chilworth lying along the straight &#x27;new&#x27; stretch of the Southampton to Romsey road, and old Chilworth built around the &#x27;old&#x27; road.

==Etymology==
&quot;Chil&quot; is an aspirate mutation of the Common Brittonic noun &quot;cil&quot; meaning &quot;angle or corner&quot; and having the implication of &quot;boundary&quot;. The suffix &quot;worth&quot; is the Middle English cognate of the proto-Germanic &quot;warō&quot; meaning &quot;those that care for, watch, guard, protect, or defend&quot;. The name literally translates as two nouns: &quot;boundary-guards.&quot;

==Chilworth Old Village==
Chilworth Old Village, at the west end, consists of former farm workers&#x27; thatched cottages interspersed with modern houses and bungalows built in the 1950s. The Anglican Church of St Denys, which lies on the edge of the Old Village, was rebuilt in 1812 and is noted for its old bells which date from about the year 1200. Chilworth Old Village was designated a conservation area on 1 November 1989. Most of the buildings from the 16th century are situated in the Chilworth Old Village Conservation Area. The exceptions are Manor Farm and the Beehives, the latter of which are the lodges to Chilworth Manor Hotel.

==University of Southampton Science Park==
Chilworth is home to the University of Southampton Science Park, formerly known as the Chilworth Science Park. Construction started in 1984 with the first buildings finished in 1986. It houses the main satellite uplink earth station of Sky UK (formerly known as BSkyB, British Sky Broadcasting and BSB, British Satellite Broadcasting). This facility uplinks signals (both Sky and some third party) to the Astra satellites at 28.2° east.

==Facilities==
There is a small public house on the main road through the village called &quot;The Chilworth Arms&quot; (formerly &quot;The Clump&quot;). The original name of the pub, &#x27;The Clump&#x27; comes from an old earthwork. Chilworth has a village hall and football field near the pub and there is a kennel and cattery in Chilworth Common, one of the local wooded areas. The thatched post office building was originally built as a kennel for the local hounds before being handed over to the village in 1900. Now both the Post Office and the convenience store are closed.

Since the early 1960s, there has been a Village Hall, situated on the edge of the Village Green behind what is now the Chilworth Arms. Administered by a charitable trust, the Hall is available to the residents of Chilworth and the immediately surrounding vicinity, for meetings, events and many other forms of recreation and leisure-time occupation, with the object of generating and improving a local community spirit. The Hall has a microsite on the Village&#x27;s website where more details may be found, including availability and how to book.

==Chilworth Manor==
Chilworth Manor was a mansion house on the Chilworth Estate. John Willis Fleming rebuilt the house in 1904. The Flemings sold Chilworth Manor in 1947. In 1967 it was sold by Catherine Ann Young, wife of British entrepreneur Jock Young (CEO of &quot;Unity Heating&quot;), to Southampton University and converted into a hall of residence. In 1990 it was developed into a conference and training centre. In 2001, AHM, a specialist management company, acquired the property. It is now a 97 bedroom hotel, conference and event venue run by Best Western.

==Notable people==

Notable Chilworth residents have included circus impresario Jimmy Chipperfield and Southampton football stars Matthew Le Tissier, Francis Benali and James Beattie.

Richard Cockle Lucas (1800–1883), the sculptor, lived in Chilworth from 1854 onwards, originally at &quot;The Tower of the Winds&quot; (which stood opposite the former &quot;Clump Inn&quot;), and later at the nearby &quot;Chilworth Tower&quot;.

==Village design statement==
In February 2006 the Test Valley Borough Council issued a Village Design Statement for Chilworth to foster a vibrant community and preserve Chilworth&#x27;s very special characteristics: its woodland, architecture and village environment.

<doc id="635122" wikidata="Q3039651" url="?curid=635122" title="Nikolai Khokhlov">
<text>Nikolai Yevgenievich Khokhlov (Cyrillic: Николай Евгеньевич Хохлов; 7 June 1922 – 17 September 2007) was a KGB officer who defected to the United States in 1954. He testified about KGB activities. The KGB unsuccessfully tried to kill him with poison in 1957.

==Family background==

Nikolai Khoklov was born in 1922, in Nizhny Novgorod. Khokhlov&#x27;s parents divorced when he was very young. He was not well-acquainted with his father, who later served as a commissar in the Red Army. During the Battle for Moscow, the elder Khokhlov was transferred to a penal battalion because he had made unfavourable remarks about Joseph Stalin. Khokhlov&#x27;s father died in the battalion.

His stepfather, a lawyer, volunteered to defend Moscow in 1941 and died in action almost immediately. As Khokhlov later put it, &quot;The army needed cannon fodder&quot;.

==NKVD career==
In October 1941, Khokhlov, then 19 years old, was a member of an NKVD quartet who were trained to commit a spectacular attack against Nazi officers during their victory celebration in the occupied Moscow. The mastermind behind the plan was Mikhail Maklyarskiy, a senior NKVD official. The four young agents would have played a vaudeville group on the celebration. Khokhlov was chosen for his role on his whistling abilities. During the training, he had his first great romance with fellow agent, singer Tasya Ignatova. After the German retreat from the outskirts of Moscow, the deadly show was cancelled.

Nikolai Khokhlov was a member of a successful military unit that fought behind the enemy lines during World War II. He was disguised as a Nazi officer after parachuting into German-occupied Belarus. He played a part in the assassination of Wilhelm Kube, the Nazi Gauleiter of Belarus. After the war, Khokhlov became the prototype for the main character in a 1947 Soviet film, &quot;Feat of a Scout&quot; (&quot;Подвиг разведчика&quot;).

==Assassination mission==
In 1954, Khokhlov was sent by the KGB to Frankfurt to supervise two men whose task was to kill Georgiy Okolovich, a chairman of the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists. He discussed the situation with his wife, Yana, who said, &quot;If this man is killed, you will be a murderer. I cannot be the wife of a murderer&quot; and decided not to follow the order. Khokhlov went to Okolovich&#x27;s flat and told him: &quot;Georgiy Sergeyevich, I have come to you from Moscow. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has ordered your assassination. The murder is entrusted to my group... I can’t let this murder happen.&quot; Khokhlov defected to the United States following his failure to carry out the assassination order. In retaliation, his wife in the Soviet Union was arrested and sentenced to five years of involuntary settlement.

==Poisoning by thallium==
Khokhlov was treated for thallium poisoning in Frankfurt in 1957, as a result of a failed assassination attempt by the Thirteenth Department of the KGB. This case is often claimed to be the first radiological attack by the KGB, especially when comparison with the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko is drawn, although it remains unclear what isotope was used, if any. Former KGB officer Stanislav Lekarev claimed, however, that Khokhlov was poisoned by radioactive polonium (not thallium), exactly as Litvinenko was. Litvinenko&#x27;s poisoning was also initially mistaken for thallium.

==Life in the United States==

After graduating with a PhD from Duke University, Khokhlov taught undergraduate and graduate psychology classes at California State University, San Bernardino from 1968 to 1992. He retired as a professor emeritus in 1993. 

In the United States, Khokhlov married again. With his second wife Tanya, he had two daughters and a son, Misha, who died several years later due to a kidney failure.

In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin pardoned Khokhlov. The same year he returned to Moscow for a short stay, for the first time since the 1950s. He later made an e-mail contact with, then eventually met, his son in Russia of whom he had not been previously aware. 

Nikolai Khokhlov died of a heart attack in San Bernardino, California, in September 2007. He was buried next to the grave of his son.

<doc id="635125" wikidata="Q2704440" url="?curid=635125" title="Let there be light">
<text>&quot;Let there be light&quot; is an English translation of the Hebrew (&quot;yehi &#x27;or&quot;) found in Genesis 1:3 of the Torah, the first part of the Hebrew Bible. In Old Testament translations of the phrase, translations include the Greek phrase (&quot;genēthḗtō phôs&quot;) and the Latin phrases and . It is part of the Genesis creation narrative.

==Genesis 1:3==
The phrase comes from the third verse of the Book of Genesis. In the King James Bible, it reads, in context:

==Origin and etymology==
In biblical Hebrew, the phrase (&quot;yəhî ’ôr&quot;) is made of two words. (&quot;yəhî&quot;) is the third-person masculine singular jussive form of &quot;to exist&quot; and (&quot;’ôr&quot;) means &quot;light.&quot;

In the Koine Greek Septuagint the phrase is translated &quot;&quot; — &quot;kaì eîpen ho Theós genēthḗtō phôs kaì egéneto phôs&quot;. &quot;Γενηθήτω&quot; is the imperative form of &quot;γίγνομαι&quot;, &quot;to come into being.&quot;

The original Latinization of the Greek translation used in the Vetus Latina was lux sit (&quot;light – let it exist&quot; or &quot;let light exist&quot;), which has been used occasionally, although there is debate as to its accuracy.

In the Latin Vulgate Bible, the Hebrew phrase is translated in Latin as fiat lux. In context, the translation is &quot;&quot; (&quot;And said God let there be light, and there was light&quot;). Literally, &quot;fiat lux&quot; would be translated as &quot;let light be made&quot; (&quot;fiat&quot; is the third person singular present passive subjunctive form of the verb &quot;facio&quot;, meaning &quot;to do&quot; or &quot;to make&quot;). The Douay–Rheims Bible translates the phrase, from the Vulgate, as &quot;Be light made. And light was made.&quot;

<doc id="635128" wikidata="Q894085" url="?curid=635128" title="Borough of Great Yarmouth">
<text>The Borough of Great Yarmouth is a local government district with borough status in Norfolk, England. It is named after its main town, Great Yarmouth, and also contains the town of Gorleston-on-Sea and a number of villages and rural areas, including part of The Broads. Other notable settlements include Caister-on-Sea, Hemsby, Hopton-on-Sea and Winterton-on-Sea.

The borough is on the east coast of Norfolk, facing the North Sea. It borders North Norfolk to the north, Broadland to the west, South Norfolk to the south-west, and East Suffolk to the south.

==History==
The town of Great Yarmouth was an ancient borough, having been granted a charter in 1208. The borough was enlarged in 1668 to take in the Southtown area (also known as Little Yarmouth) on the south side of the River Yare in the parish of Gorleston. In 1703 the borough was given the right to appoint a mayor. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836, when it was also enlarged to include the rest of the parish of Gorleston. When elected county councils were created in 1889, Great Yarmouth was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services and so it became a county borough, independent from the new Norfolk County Council.

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of the former county borough and parts of another two districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
* Blofield and Flegg Rural District (parishes lying generally north-east of the River Bure, rest went to Broadland)
* Great Yarmouth County Borough
* Lothingland Rural District (parishes of Belton, Bradwell, Burgh Castle, Fritton and St Olaves and Hopton-on-Sea only, rest went to Waveney)
The Lothingland parishes had been in East Suffolk prior to the 1974 reforms; their inclusion in the Great Yarmouth district was brought about as an amendment to the draft legislation at committee stage proposed by Anthony Fell, Member of Parliament for the Great Yarmouth constituency.

The new district was named Great Yarmouth after its main settlement. The new district was granted borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Great Yarmouth&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1703.

==Governance==

Great Yarmouth Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Norfolk County Council. Parts of the borough are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within The Broads, town planning is the responsibility of the Broads Authority. The borough council appoints one of its councillors to sit on that authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a Conservative minority administration.

The first election to the borough council as reformed under the Local Government Act 1972 was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Great Yarmouth. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1999 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2004 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 17 wards, with each ward election one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 71.5% of Great Yarmouth voted to leave the European Union, the 5th highest such leave vote in the country.

;UK Youth Parliament
Although the UK Youth Parliament is an apolitical organisation, the elections are run in a way similar to that of the Local Elections. The votes come from 11 to 18-year olds and are combined to make the decision of the next, 2-year Member of Youth Parliament. The elections are run at different times across the country with Great Yarmouth&#x27;s typically being in early Spring and bi-annually.
===Premises===
The council is based at Great Yarmouth Town Hall on Hall Plain, which was completed in 1882 for the old borough council.

==Geography==
The borough comprises the urban area of Great Yarmouth itself, together with 21 surrounding parishes. At the time of the 2001 census, the borough had an area of 182 km², of which 26 km² was in the urban area and 156 km² in the surrounding parishes. The borough had a population of 90,810 in 39,380 households, with 47,288 people in 21,007 households living in the urban area, whilst 43,522 people in 18,373 households lived in the surrounding parishes.

<doc id="635151" wikidata="Q560982" url="?curid=635151" title="Boris Podolsky">
<text>Boris Yakovlevich Podolsky (; June 29, 1896 – November 28, 1966) was a Russian-American physicist of Jewish descent, noted for his work with Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen on entangled wave functions and the EPR paradox.

== Education ==
In 1896, Boris Podolsky was born into a poor Jewish family in Taganrog, in the Don Host Oblast of the Russian Empire and attended the Taganrog Gymnasium. He moved to the United States in 1913. After receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California in 1918, he served in the US Army and then worked at the Los Angeles Bureau of Power and Light. In 1926, he obtained an MS in mathematics from the University of Southern California. In 1928, he received a PhD in theoretical physics (under Paul Sophus Epstein) from Caltech.

== Career ==
Under a National Research Council Fellowship, Podolsky spent a year at the University of California, Berkeley, followed by a year at Leipzig University. In 1930, he returned to Caltech, working with Richard C. Tolman for one year. He then went to the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology (Kharkiv, USSR), collaborating with Vladimir Fock, Paul Dirac (who was there on a visit), and Lev Landau. In 1932 he published a seminal early paper on Quantum Electrodynamics with Dirac and Fock, In 1933, he returned to the US with a fellowship from the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.

In a letter dated November 10, 1933, to Abraham Flexner, founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, Einstein described Podolsky as &quot;&quot;one of the most brilliant of the younger men who has worked and published with [Paul] Dirac&quot;.&quot; In 1935 Einstein and others at the Institute wrote letters of recommendation for Podolsky, addressed to Louis T. More, Dean of the Graduate School of the University of Cincinnati, in which Einstein wrote, &quot;&quot;I am happy to be able to tell you that I estimate Podolsky&#x27;s abilities very highly.. he is an independent investigator of unquestionable talent&quot;.&quot; In 1935, Podolsky took a post as professor of mathematical physics at the University of Cincinnati. At the University of Cincinnati he was MS adviser to Chihiro Kikuchi, and PhD adviser to Herman Branson and Alex Green. In 1961, he moved to Xavier University, Cincinnati, where he worked until his death in 1966.

== Work ==
Working with Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen, Podolsky conceived the EPR paradox. This famous paper stimulated debate as to the interpretation of quantum mechanics, culminating with Bell&#x27;s theorem and the advent of quantum information theory.

In 1933, Podolsky and Lev Landau had the idea to write a textbook on electromagnetism beginning with special relativity and emphasizing theoretical postulates rather than experimental laws. This project did not come to fruition due to Podolsky&#x27;s return to the United States, where he had immigrated in 1913. However, in the hands of Lev Landau and E. Lifshitz, the outline they produced became &quot;The Classical Theory of Fields&quot; (1951). On the same basis, Podolsky and K. Kunz produced &quot;Fundamentals of Electrodynamics&quot;, Marcel Dekker Press (1969), to which Podolsky&#x27;s son, Robert, contributed most of the questions at the end of each chapter.

== Possible contact with Soviet spies during World War II ==
A 2009 book by John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr and Alexander Vassiliev, &quot;Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America&quot;, identifies Podolsky as a contact (QUANTUM) who met twice with Soviet secret services in 1942 and 1943. The evidence for these contacts is somewhat indirect. Early during World War II, several VENONA cables identify a contact named QUANTUM who sought out Soviet intelligence in 1942 and asked for a position in the USSR to work on processing Uranium 235. A 1943 VENONA cable shows QUANTUM provided relatively simple equations known as Graham&#x27;s law of gaseous diffusion (known since 1848) which can be used to separate fissile U-235 from unwanted U-238. QUANTUM was paid $300 for this information according to a VENONA cable. The Soviets never contacted him again because they felt QUANTUM was unreliable. A former KGB officer named Alexander Vassiliev took notes from the KGB archive after the fall of the USSR which suggested that QUANTUM was Podolsky.

== In popular culture ==
Podolsky is played by the actor Gene Saks in the 1994 Hollywood film &quot;I.Q.&quot;

<doc id="635164" wikidata="Q1094098" url="?curid=635164" title="City of Durham (district)">
<text>The City of Durham was, from 1974 to 2009, a non-metropolitan district of County Durham in North East England, with the status of borough and city.

==Formation==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the existing City of Durham and Framwelgate with Brandon and Byshottles Urban District and Durham Rural District. The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

==Durham City Council==

The council was made up of 50 councillors elected in all-out elections every four years (last elections 2007). The last political composition was Liberal Democrat 27, Labour 15, Independent 8. The 2003 elections saw the Liberal Democrats gain overall political control of the council from Labour, benefiting from boundary changes and substantial gains in Durham&#x27;s eastern suburbs. Labour had held overall control of the City Council continually since the early 1980s.

Durham City Council was abolished when the district of Durham was abolished in 2009. In 2018 a new parish council was formed, initially known as the City of Durham Parish Council, to represent the core urban area of Durham.

==Mayors==
Mayors of the City of Durham are styled &quot;The Right Worshipful, The Mayor of Durham&quot;. The Mayoralty is taken as a continuation of the mayoralty of the pre-1974 Durham and Framwelgate. The Mayor of Durham is entitled to an armed ceremonial bodyguard and claims to be equal fifth in civic precedence behind the Lord Mayors of London, York, Cardiff and Belfast Since the merger of the City Council into the Durham County Council unitary authority in 2009, mayoral appointments have been made by the Charter Trustees of the City of Durham (composing the Durham County Councillors with divisions within the former City of Durham district area).

===Other civic appointments ===
Other civic appointments in the City of Durham at its merger with Durham County Council included:
* Deputy Mayor – currently Councillor Robert Wynn.
* Town Clerk – the council&#x27;s chief executive.
* Recorder – the council&#x27;s director of legal services.
* Chaplain – the dean of Durham Cathedral.
* Judicial Recorder (since 2005) – currently Judge Richard Lowden
* Billet Master – to be held by a senior Durham City police officer
* Pant Master – the council&#x27;s director of environmental services
* Posts within the Mayoral Bodyguard
* Honorary Aldermen

==Civil parishes==
The central area of the City of Durham (the area covered by the pre-1974 City of Durham and Framwelgate) was not parished at the time the district existed, however a civil parish called City of Durham was formed in 2018. Those parts of the district formerly part of Durham Rural District or Brandon and Byshottles Urban District are all parished. The current Brandon and Byshottles Parish Council is co-terminous with the pre-1974 UDC and has inherited some of its responsibilities (e.g. allotments).

Civil parishes in the former City of Durham district were:
* Bearpark
* Belmont
* Brancepeth
* Brandon and Byshottles
* Cassop-cum-Quarrington
* Coxhoe
* Croxdale and Hett
* Framwellgate Moor
* Kelloe
* Pittington
* Shadforth
* Sherburn
* Shincliffe
* West Rainton
* Witton Gilbert

==Abolition==
The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England although Durham will retain its city charter through the appointment of charter trustees. All functions of principal authority local government are now administered by a unitary Durham County Council, including the appointment of the Mayor of Durham.

Proposals to create a Durham Town Council, covering the city centre and Newton Hall, were put forward in 2008. While supported by the Liberal Democrat controlled City Council, the Labour controlled County Council opposed it. Following a local consultation in 2017 a new council known as the City of Durham Parish Council came into being in 2018, with a Liberal Democrat majority.

<text>A mill town, also known as factory town or mill village, is typically a settlement that developed around one or more mills or factories, often cotton mills or factories producing textiles.

====Żyrardów====

The town grew out of a textile factory founded in 1833 by the sons of Feliks Lubienski, who owned the land where it was built. They brought in a specialist from France and his newly designed machines. He was French inventor, Philippe de Girard from Lourmarin. He became a director of the firm. The factory town developed during the 19th century into a significant textile mill town in Poland.
In honour of Girard, &#x27;Ruda Guzowska&#x27; as the original estate was called, was renamed Żyrardów, a toponym derived of the polonised spelling of Girard&#x27;s name.

Most of Żyrardów&#x27;s monuments are located in the manufacturing area which dates from the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is widely believed that Żyrardów&#x27;s textile settlement is the only entire urban industrial complex from the 19th-century to be preserved in Europe.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;mill town&quot; usually refers to the 19th-century textile manufacturing towns of northern England and the Scottish Lowlands, particularly those in Lancashire (cotton) and Yorkshire (wool).

Some former mill towns have a symbol of the textile industry in their town badge. Some towns may have statues dedicated to textile workers (e.g. Colne) or have a symbol in the badge of local schools (e.g. Ossett School).

The list above includes some towns where textiles was not the predominant industry. For example, mining was a key industry in Wigan and Leigh in Greater Manchester, and in Ossett in Yorkshire.

In thousands of spindles.

On his tour of northern England in 1849, Scottish publisher Angus Reach said:

====New England and Northeast====

Beginning with Samuel Slater and technological information smuggled out of England by Francis Cabot Lowell, large mills were established in New England in the early to mid-19th century. Mill towns, sometimes planned, built and owned as a company town, grew in the shadow of the industries. The region became a manufacturing powerhouse along rivers like the Housatonic, Quinebaug, Shetucket, Blackstone, Merrimack, Nashua, Cocheco, Saco, Androscoggin, Kennebec or Winooski.

In the 20th century, alternatives to water power were developed, and it became more profitable for companies to manufacture textiles in southern states where cotton was grown and winters did not require significant heating costs. Finally, the Great Depression acted as a catalyst that sent several struggling New England firms into bankruptcy.

<text>The common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) is a species of snake in the subfamily Natricinae of the family Colubridae. The species is indigenous to North America and found widely across the continent. There are several recognized subspecies. Most common garter snakes have a pattern of yellow stripes on a black, brown or green background, and their average total length (including tail) is about , with a maximum total length of about . The average body mass is . The common garter snake is the state reptile of Massachusetts.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The subspecific name &quot;fitchi&quot; is in honor of the American herpetologist Henry Sheldon Fitch.

The subspecific name &quot;pickeringii&quot; is in honor of the American naturalist Charles E. Pickering.

===Subspecies===
Current scientific classification recognizes 12 subspecies (ordered by date):
A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Thamnophis&quot;.

==Anatomy and description==
Common garter snakes are thin snakes. Few grow over about long, and most stay smaller. Most have longitudinal stripes in many different colors. Common garter snakes come in a wide range of colors, including green, blue, yellow, gold, red, orange, brown, and black.

===Venom===
Garter snakes have a mild venom in their saliva, which may be toxic to the amphibians and other small animals that they prey upon. For humans, a bite is not dangerous, and many handlers can attest to garter snakes gently biting in protest when held or restrained; these bites do not often break the skin, given the garter snake&#x27;s smaller size, but may cause slight itching, burning, and/or swelling at the location of the bite. However, it is more likely that, prior to expending their energy through biting, garter snakes will secrete a foul-smelling fluid (&quot;musk&quot;, &quot;musking&quot;, &quot;skunking&quot;) from postanal glands.

Common garter snakes are resistant to naturally-occurring poisons in their prey, such as that of the American toad and rough-skinned newt, the latter of which can kill a human if ingested. Garter snakes (in addition to their own mildly venomous saliva) have the ability to retain poisons from their consumed amphibian prey, thus making them poisonous and deterring any would-be predators.

The common garter snake uses toxicity for both offense and defense. On the offensive side, the snake&#x27;s venom can be toxic to some of its smaller prey, such as mice and other rodents. On the defensive side, the snake uses its resistance to toxicity to provide an important antipredator capability. A study on the evolutionary development of resistance of tetrodotoxin compared two populations of &quot;Thamnophis&quot; and then tested inside a population of &quot;T. sirtalis&quot;. Those that were exposed to and lived in the same environment as the newts (&quot;Taricha granulosa&quot;) or rough-skinned newt, that produce tetrodotoxin when eaten were more immune to the toxin (see figure).It seems that the two species were in an evolutionary arms race.

While resistance to tetrodotoxin is beneficial in acquiring newt prey, costs are associated with it as well. Consuming the toxin can lead to reduced speed and sometimes no movement for extended periods of time, along with impaired thermoregulation. The antipredator display that this species uses demonstrates the idea of an &quot;arms race&quot; between different species and their antipredator displays. Along the entire geographical interaction of &quot;T. granulosa&quot; and &quot;T. sirtalis&quot;, patches occur that correspond to strong coevolution, as well as weak or absent coevolution. Populations of &quot;T. sirtalis&quot; that do not live in areas that contain &quot;T. granulosa&quot; contain the lowest levels of tetrodotoxin resistance, while those that do live in the same area have the highest levels of tetrodotoxin resistance. In populations where tetrodotoxin is absent in &quot;T. granulosa&quot;, resistance in &quot;T. sirtalis&quot; is selected against because the mutation causes lower average population fitness. This helps maintain polymorphism within garter snake populations.

==Habitat==
The habitat of the common garter snake ranges from forests, fields, and prairies to streams, wetlands, meadows, marshes, and ponds, and it is often found near water. Depending on the subspecies, the common garter snake can be found as far south the southernmost tip of Florida in the United States and as far north as the southernmost tip of the Northwest Territories in Canada. It is found at altitudes from sea level to mountains.

==Behavior and life history==
The common garter snake is a diurnal snake. In summer, it is most active in the morning and late afternoon; in cooler seasons or climates, it restricts its activity to the warm afternoons.

In warmer southern areas, the snake is active year-round; otherwise, it sleeps in common dens, sometimes in great numbers. On warm winter afternoons, some snakes have been observed emerging from their hibernacula to bask in the sun.

===Antipredatory displays===
Garter snakes exhibit many different behaviors to ward off predators. Garter snakes exhibit a greater variety of body postures than other snakes. Under selection by predation, these snakes have developed postural responses that are highly variable and heritable. These are highly variable even within a single population. Different postures indicate whether the snake is preparing to flee, fight, or protect itself. Different biological factors such as body temperature and sex also influence whether the snake exhibits certain antipredatory behaviors.

The warmer the temperature of a garter snake, the more likely the snake is to flee a predator; a snake with a cooler body temperature is more likely to remain stationary or attack. Male garter snakes are also more likely to flee. Garter snakes that exhibit more aggressive antipredatory displays tend to also be fast and have high stamina. However, the reason for this correlation is unknown.

The first response of the snake to a predator is often a bluff. When the snake was teased with a finger under laboratory conditions, the snake reacted aggressively, but once touched, it became passive. This may be because the snake is disinclined to attack an organism it sees as larger than itself. Garter snakes do not exhibit mimicry or aposematic coloration; relying on cryptic coloration for protection, they will freeze until they know they are spotted, then attempt a stealthy departure.

The decision of a juvenile garter snake to attack a predator can be affected by whether the snake has just eaten or not. Snakes that have just eaten are more likely to strike a predator or stimulus than snakes that do not have a full stomach. Snakes that have just eaten a large animal are less mobile.

Another factor that controls the antipredatory response of the garter snake is where on its body the snake is attacked. Many birds and mammals prefer to attack the head of the snake. Garter snakes are more likely to hide their heads and move their tails back and forth when being attacked close to the head. Snakes that are attacked in the middles of their bodies are more likely to flee or exhibit open-mouthed warning reactions.

Age may be another factor that contributes to antipredatory responses. As garter snakes mature, the length of time for which they can engage in physical activity at 25 °C increases. Juvenile snakes can only be physically active for 3–5 minutes. Adult snakes can be physically active for up to 25 minutes. This is mostly due to aerobic energy production; pulmonary aeration increases up to three times in adult garter snakes when compared to juveniles. The quick fatigue of the juveniles limits the habitats they can live in, as well as their food sources. It also affects the antipredator response of both juvenile and adult garter snakes; without sufficient energy production, the snake cannot effect an antipredatory response.

===Reproduction===
Generally, populations include far more males than females, so during mating season, they form &quot;mating balls&quot;, in which one or two females are completely swamped by ten or more males. Sometimes a male snake mates with a female before hibernation, and the female stores the sperm internally until spring, when she allows her eggs to be fertilized. If she mates again in the spring, the fall sperm degenerate and the spring sperm fertilize her eggs. The females may give birth ovoviviparously to 12 to 40 young from July through October.

In the early part of sex, when snakes are coming out of hibernation, the males generally emerge first to be ready when the females wake up. Some males assume the role of a female and lead other males away from the burrow, luring them with a fake female pheromone. After such a male has led rivals away, he &quot;turns&quot; back into a male and races back to the den, just as the females emerge. He is then the first to mate with all the females he can catch. This method also serves to help warm males by tricking other males into surrounding and heating up the male, and is particularly useful to subspecies in colder climates (such as those inhabited by &quot;T. s. parietalis&quot;); this type of mimicry is primarily found in that subspecies. These deceptive males have been found to mate with females significantly more often than males that do not exhibit this mimicry.

==Ecology==
===Hunting and diet===
The diet of &quot;T. sirtalis&quot; consists mainly of amphibians and earthworms, but also leeches, slugs, snails, insects, crayfish, fish, lizards, other snakes, small birds, and rodents. Common garter snakes are effective at catching fast-moving creatures such as fish and tadpoles.

===Natural predators===
Animals that prey on the common garter snake include large fish (such as bass and catfish), American bullfrogs, common snapping turtles, larger snakes, hawks, raccoons, foxes, wild turkeys, and domestic cats and dogs.

==Conservation status==
The common garter snake is considered to be a least-concern species by the IUCN Red List due to its wide distribution and high population size. Water contamination, urban expansion, and residential and industrial development are all threats to the common garter snake. The San Francisco garter snake (&quot;T. s. tetrataenia&quot;), which is extremely scarce and occurs only in the vicinity of ponds and reservoirs in San Mateo County, California, has been listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1967.

<doc id="635171" wikidata="Q363734" url="?curid=635171" title="2003 Malaysian Grand Prix">
<text>The 2003 Malaysian Grand Prix (officially the 2003 Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 23 March 2003 at the Sepang International Circuit. It was the second race of the 2003 Formula One season, and it was won by Kimi Räikkönen driving the MP4-17 for McLaren-Mercedes. This was Räikkönen&#x27;s first Formula One Grand Prix victory. As well, Fernando Alonso scored his first pole position and podium finish.

Before the race, McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard was leading the championship however the Scot retired on lap three, handing the championship lead to his teammate, Kimi Räikkönen who finished third in the previous race.

==Report==

===Background===
David Coulthard was leading the championship after winning the first race of the season. Montoya was second. Kimi Räikkönen, Michael Schumacher and Jarno Trulli were in Third, Fourth and Fifth respectively.

Before the race rain was predicted with the likelihood of heavy showers at 60 per cent. High humidity was also predicted by some people however, causing the teams to be split in terms of tactics.

===Practice===
The first Friday practice session saw Fernando Alonso fastest with a time of 1:37.693 and his teammate, Jarno Trulli, two tenths of a second slower putting him in third. Giancarlo Fisichella separated the Renault&#x27;s with second fastest in the Jordan EJ13.

The second session saw Ferrari take over with Michael Schumacher completely eclipsing the efforts of Alonso in the previous session. He went fastest with a 1:34.980. His teammate, Rubens Barrichello, managed second with a 1:35.681 lap at the end of the session.

===Race===

Both the BAR of Jacques Villeneuve and the Toyota of Cristiano da Matta failed on the grid, causing them to start from the pit lane; however, this caused confusion after the warm-up lap, forcing Giancarlo Fisichella to reverse into his grid spot, the second-time the Italian took up the wrong position at this circuit. Alonso led the all-Renault front row and led the cars into the first corner, but Michael Schumacher, who started from third position, tangled whilst attempting to pass Jarno Trulli, knocking Trulli into a spin and dropping him to last. Schumacher was forced to pit for a new nosecone and after serving a drive-through penalty for the incident, dropped to the rear of the field. He later accepted blame for the incident.

A chain reaction further back in the field caused Jaguar driver Antônio Pizzonia to rear-end Juan Pablo Montoya, removing the latter&#x27;s rear wing. Montoya was forced to pit, losing two laps during a rear-wing replacement. As a result, David Coulthard of McLaren-Mercedes was left in second position, but his prospects were ended on the second lap with an electronics failure. He later criticised the team. His team-mate Räikkönen had moved into second place by passing the Sauber of Nick Heidfeld. On the tenth lap, Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello passed Heidfeld for third place.

The podium positions stayed that way with Räikkönen cutting into the lead when Alonso pitted first out of the front three on lap 14, a sign that he was carrying a lighter fuel load during qualifying. Alonso did break the record for youngest driver to lead a race (the previous record having remained since 1951). Räikkönen circulated until lap 19, using the lighter fuel load to post faster lap times, and after his pit stop emerged ahead of Alonso.

Barrichello also made up time before pitting on the 21st lap, but did not clear Alonso upon his return to the track, with a deficit of over three seconds. By this stage, Trulli had recovered to 6th place, challenging the BAR of Jenson Button for fifth position. Räikkönen gradually extended his lead, which reached 17.8 s by the 33rd lap. Button pitted on the 34th lap, allowing Trulli clean air to post faster lap times.

Alonso then pitted on the 35th lap, freeing Barrichello, who did not pit until the 38th lap and re-entered the race ahead of Alonso. Räikkönen was the last of the contenders to pit, doing so on lap 40 and further extending his lead. Meanwhile, a delay with a fuel nozzle had denied Trulli the opportunity to jump Button in the pits. Michael Schumacher, with a light car at the end of his stint, passed Trulli and Button in quick succession before conceding his gains with a final pit stop.

On lap 41 Justin Wilson pulled into the Minardi garage to retire, as the straps on his HANS device worked loose and pinched his shoulders, resulting in temporary paralysis of both his arms. It took the team nearly 10 minutes to ease Wilson out of the car before he was taken to hospital. He recovered before the next race.

On the 51st lap, Trulli spun attempting to pass Button. He and Schumacher eventually passed Button on the final corner after the Briton made a mistake. Räikkönen eventually earned his maiden Grand Prix victory with a large margin of 39s.

<doc id="635172" wikidata="Q830483" url="?curid=635172" title="Interstate 515">
<text>Interstate 515 (I-515) was a spur route of I-15 in the US state of Nevada that ran from the junction of I-15, US 93 and US 95 (the Las Vegas Spaghetti Bowl Interchange) in Downtown approximately southeast to just north of Railroad Pass in southeastern Henderson. The freeway connected traffic headed from Boulder City and Henderson to Downtown Las Vegas via a direct, high-speed route, and it ran concurrently with, US 93, and US 95 along its entire length.

The I-515 designation was first approved in 1976, but construction did not begin until 1982, and was constructed in stages until it reached its former terminus north of Railroad Pass in 1994, when signs of the designation finally were put up. I-515 was built to bypass Fremont Street and Boulder Highway, both of which were former alignments of US 93, US 95, and US 466, and provide a direct freeway connection with Henderson.

In August 2017, the segment of I-515 between the I-215 interchange and the southern city limits of Henderson was redesignated as I-11. The Nevada Department of Transportation announced in 2022 that part of the preferred alternative for the future northward extension of I-11 would follow the remainder of the I-515 alignment. Signs for I-11 along I-515 and US 95 north of I-15 began to go up in 2024, and the I-515 designation was decommissioned in May 2024.

==Route description==

The southern terminus of I-515 was at an interchange with I-11, I-215, US 93, US 95, and SR 564 in Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas. The freeway continues south as I-11 towards Boulder City and the Hoover Dam on the former alignment of I-515. The six-lane freeway travels northwest from the interchange and carried the concurrent designations of I-515, US 93, and US 95 through Henderson as it passed the Sunset Station casino and Galleria at Sunset shopping mall. I-515 then turned north and intersected Tropicana Avenue (SR 593), Flamingo Road (SR 592), and the Boulder Highway (SR 582) as it approached Las Vegas. After entering the city of Las Vegas, the highway turned west and intersected Las Vegas Boulevard on the north side of Downtown Las Vegas. I-515 ended at the Spaghetti Bowl, an interchange with I-15, while the roadway continues west as Oran K. Gragson Freeway (carrying US 95).

==History==
Prior to the completion of the freeway, US 93 and US 95 originally followed Fremont Street/Boulder Highway from Downtown Las Vegas southeast through Henderson to Boulder City. Boulder Highway was signed as a business route of US 93/US 95 after the freeway was completed, but that designation has since been removed; it is now just SR 582.

The I-515 freeway, which began construction in 1982, is a continuation of the Oran K. Gragson Freeway (named for the former Las Vegas mayor who advocated for the construction of the then Las Vegas Expressway) which ran primarily along the former West Fremont Street alignment between Las Vegas Boulevard and Rainbow Boulevard. The spur was completed southeast to Charleston Boulevard (SR 159) in 1984, to Tropicana Avenue (SR 593) in 1986, to Russell Road in 1988, to Lake Mead Parkway (SR 564) (then known as &quot;Lake Mead Drive,&quot; SR 146 west and SR 147 east), in 1990, and finally to Railroad Pass just south of Boulder Highway in 1994 at an at-grade intersection with Paradise Hills Drive (which was eventually removed). With this extension of highway complete, the length of I-515 was .

The I-515 designation was first approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on July 12, 1976, from the I-15 interchange to the junction of US 93 and US 95 (at Boulder Highway, current exit 70). On December 7, 1984, AASHTO approved the southeasterly extension of the route to its former terminus near Boulder City. Even though the route number was approved prior to the highway&#x27;s construction, I-515 was not consistently signed until after the freeway was completed down to its former southern terminus north of Railroad Pass in 1994.
With the pending construction of the Boulder City Bypass introducing the I-11 designation to Nevada, the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) sought to connect the new route to other Interstate Highways. NDOT submitted an application to AASHTO at their spring 2014 meeting to request the designation of &quot;Future Interstate 11&quot;, which included routing I-11 along existing I-515 between Railroad Pass and the I-215 Henderson Spaghetti Bowl interchange—AASHTO approved this request on May 29, 2014, with condition that it also be approved by the Federal Highway Administration. The Boulder City Bypass was completed in August 2018. As a result, I-515 was shortened by to its current length of . NDOT began replacing I-515 signs along the southern stretch with I-11 signs on March 17, 2019. The signing continued through April 26, 2019.

The designation of future I-11 is planned to connect the Phoenix, Arizona, and Las Vegas metropolitan areas, with potential for future expansion northwest of Las Vegas to Reno in the northwestern part of the state. The former I-515 alignment, with a continuation northwest along US 95, was one of three corridors under consideration to carry the I-11 designation through the Las Vegas Valley. On July 27, 2022, it was announced that the Nevada Department of Transportation had chosen the central corridor, following the former path of I-515 and US 95, as the preferred alternative for the alignment of I-11 through Las Vegas, and signage was put up in May 2024; the I-515 designation was decommissioned at that time.

Beginning in 2022, several construction projects have been started or planned to improve the I-515 corridor as a whole. The projects include soundwall and retaining wall reconstruction, bridge rehabilitation, and interchange improvements. All the projects are expected to be started by 2027.

==Exit list==

Exits listed below reflect the maximum extent of I-515 prior to the southern portion being renumbered to I-11. Exits on I-515 were numbered according to US 95 mileposts.

<doc id="635175" wikidata="Q7493669" url="?curid=635175" title="Mochras">
<text>Mochras (also known in English as Shell Island) is a peninsula lying west of Llanbedr in Gwynedd, Wales. The peninsula was formed after the River Artro was diverted by the Earl of Winchilsea in 1819 from its previous course where it entered the sea to the south of Mochras. Prior to this, access to the ancient settlement on the &#x27;island&#x27; would have been through the village of Llandanwg, which is now across the estuary.

Mochras is known for the wide variety of seashells that wash up on the beach, and for its wild flowers. It is said to have been connected to the mythical Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod.

The peninsula lies within the Snowdonia National Park. From the end of October to the following March local farmers bring their sheep from the lowlands to graze on the &#x27;island&#x27;.

==Geology==
Mochras is significant for the UK earth sciences. The area consists of a low lying raised beach (which encompasses the nearby Llanbedr Airport).

Between 1967 and 1969 the Institute of Geological Sciences (now known as the British Geological Survey) drilled a 1,938 m stratigraphic proving borehole at Mochras Farm. This found relatively young Tertiary and Mesozoic rocks (including a well-developed Upper, Middle and Lower Lias section towards the base of the Jurassic), faulted against the ancient Cambrian rocks of the Harlech dome. In 1971, the vertical throw of the fault was judged to be at least .

==Access==
Public vehicular access to the peninsula is only possible via a causeway across the estuary of the River Artro when the tide is out. Access on foot is always possible from the adjacent Morfa Dyffryn beach, which extends for several kilometres south of Mochras. Access to emergency vehicles is available at any time through the neighbouring airfield.

==Amenities==
Mochras has a popular camp site which offers the opportunity to practise &quot;wild camping&quot; in pitches which are far from the nearest neighbour (and from toilet and other facilities). Camp fires are allowed on the beach; with only raised, contained fires and barbecues allowed on the campsite.

<doc id="635181" wikidata="Q2300821" url="?curid=635181" title="Steep Holm">
<text>Steep Holm ( and later ) is an English island lying in the Bristol Channel. The island covers at high tide, expanding to at mean low water. At its highest point it is above mean sea level. Administratively it forms part of the unitary authority of North Somerset within the ceremonial county of Somerset; between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was administered as part of Avon. Nearby is Flat Holm island, part of Wales.

The Carboniferous Limestone island rises to about and serves as a wind and wave break, sheltering the upper reaches of the Bristol Channel. The island is now uninhabited, with the exception of the wardens. It is protected as a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) with a large bird population and plants including wild peonies. There was a signal station or watchtower on the island in Roman times, but there may have been human habitation as early as the Iron Age. In the 6th century it was home to St Gildas and to a small Augustinian priory in the 12th and 13th centuries. An inn was built in 1832 and used for holidays in the 19th century. A bird sanctuary was established in 1931 and since 1951 has been leased to charitable trusts. It is now owned by the Kenneth Allsop Memorial Trust.

In the 1860s the island was fortified with ten 7-inch rifled muzzle loaders as one of the Palmerston Forts for the coastal defence of the Bristol Channel until it was abandoned in 1898. The infrastructure was reused in World War I and II when MarkVII6-inch breech-loading guns and search lights were installed. To enable the movement of materials, soldiers from the Indian Army Service Corps initially used mules and then installed a cable-operated winched switchback railway.

==Geology and ecology==

The island is formed of Carboniferous Limestone and is often described as geologically a continuation of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down; however, the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down. On Steep Holm the dip is about 30 degrees to the north whereas at Brean Down it is 30 degrees to the south. There are some folds and fractures with dip angles up to 75 degrees created during the final phases of the Variscan orogeny near the end of the Carboniferous Period, 300 million years ago.

The island rises to about from the surrounding sea and covers at high tide, whereas at low tide it expands to due to the tidal range of , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. There are many caves on the island, and pot holes up to deep in the surrounding sea bed that are believed to be the remnants of collapsed cave systems. The caves on the islands cliffs are at two different levels: the caves in the current inter-tidal zone which are below the water table and are producing stalactites, and many others high up on the cliffs that were on the water line many thousands of years ago.

Steep Holm is protected as a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), notification having taken place in 1952. There is a large bird population, particularly European herring gulls &quot;(Larus argentatus)&quot; and lesser black-backed gulls &quot;(Larus fuscus)&quot;. There has also been a small population of muntjac deer. The plateau at the top of the island has a layer of soil between and deep. It has a red colour from veins of iron in the rock and has arrived as sand particles less than in diameter. The island is the only site in the UK on which wild peonies &quot;(Paeonia mascula)&quot; grow, although these have been damaged by the fungus botrytis. The wild peony was introduced to the island of Steep Holm, possibly by monks, or brought from the Mediterranean by the Romans. Alexanders (&quot;Smyrnium olusatrum&quot;) is also common along with golden samphire, buck&#x27;s-horn plantain (&quot;Plantago coronopus&quot;) and wild leeks (&quot;Allium ampeloprasum&quot;). The only reptiles on the island are slowworms (&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;).

==History==

===Prehistoric to Roman===

The earliest sign of human activity on the island are prehistoric vertebrae of red deer discovered in Five Johns&#x27; Cave during an exploration in 1975. Worked flints from the Mesolithic and scrapers from the Neolithic were uncovered as part of the Priory excavations carried out between 1977 and 1992.

Roman remains, possibly a signal station or watchtower, have been identified on the island by an electrical resistance survey. Accurate exploration and interpretation of the site is difficult as it was reused by builders in both the Victorian era and during World War II. A carved stone head found on the island in 1991 is likely to be a Celtic head from the Romano-British era, but may be from the Iron Age. In addition to shards of cooking pots from the Roman era, some luxury items have been identified including Arretine ware, La Tène style brooches, and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140 AD which was made in southern Spain. There have also been shards of Castor ware. Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying the presence of a heating system and possibly a bath house. Roman coins from the reigns of Claudius Gothicus (268–270) and Tetricus I (271–273) have also been found.

===Religious foundations===

According to legend, first recorded by John Leland in the 16th century, Saint Gildas, the author of &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;, lived on Steep Holm during the 6th century. He arrived on Steep Holm after visiting his friend Saint Cadoc, who lived on Flat Holm as a hermit. Gildas supposedly left the island, after pirates from Orkney carried off his servant and furniture, to become Abbot of Glastonbury. Other semi-legendary saints are also associated with the island; in John Rous&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Angliae&quot; (c. 1480), Rous claims that Saint Dubricius, the saint said to have crowned Arthur, retired to an hermitage on the island of &#x27;Stepeholm&#x27; in the River Severn. The Vikings took refuge on Steep Holm during the summer of 914 and then carried out raids on the coast of Somerset at Watchet and Porlock, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. At the end of the 12th century, there was a small priory of Canons Regular of St Michael on the island. The only priory building fully excavated measured long and wide, with the cloisters and other structures still to be identified. The date of the original foundation of the priory is unclear; however, in the early 13th century the patron was William I de Cantilupe. His family were also patrons of Studley Priory in Warwickshire. His granddaughter married Lord Robert de Tregoz who acquired the freehold of the whole island; however, endowments for the upkeep of the priory were declining, which led to it being abandoned between 1260 and 1265, the monks returning to Studley Priory. A Blue Lias memorial stone from the abbey, which has a Cross of Lorraine, was found in 1867 during the fortification of the island. It was incorporated into an armoury leading to the naming of the &quot;tombstone battery&quot;.

===Manorial ownership===

The island seems to have been held, in association with the local manors of Uphill and Christon, by the Bek family, who granted it to Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. Although the mechanism is unclear, it next passed to the Berkeley family with Maurice de Berkeley, the second Baron Berkeley, holding it in 1315. The site was used again by warreners in the 14th and 15th centuries. They lived in one of the ruined priory buildings which was rebuilt.

By 1453 the overlordship of the island was held by James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond, and in 1460 the advowson was exercised by Margaret Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury. Margaret Talbot (née de Beauchamp) was a distant cousin of James Butler as both were descended from different sons of Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick. In other words, James Butler (via his mother Joan Butler, Countess of Ormond (née Beauchamp) and his grandfather William Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny, whilst Margaret Talbot was daughter of Elizabeth de Beauchamp (née Berkeley) and the granddaughter of Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick. In short, James Butler&#x27;s and Margaret Talbot&#x27;s de Beauchamp grandparents were brothers. Of note is that Margaret Talbot was the daughter of Elizabeth Berkeley, Countess of Warwick (and her husband Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick) from which discord in the Berkeley family was to emerge (see below). Furthermore, Elizabeth Berkeley was the only daughter of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley, showing that ownership still resided to some extent in the Berkeley family since Maurice de Berkeley took over the island in 1315 – Margaret Talbot was the great, great, great-granddaughter of Maurice de Berkeley.

However, in the years following, the ownership of a variety of estates, including Norton Beauchamp, to which Steep Holm was attached, was disputed. At the heart of this was the dispute from how the Barony was passed on from Thomas Berkeley, the 5th Baron. These disputes had on one side James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley, also known as &#x27;James the Just&#x27; (not to be confused with the other 1st Baron Berkeley Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley who pre-dated him by 150 years). Yet it was to James whom the Barony transferred to under a new creation by writ since his uncle, the aforementioned Thomas de Berkeley (5th Baron) had no male heirs even though he had named his only daughter (Elizabeth Berkeley) as his heir. This was to be the start of a longstanding legal dispute.

On one side of the dispute originating through the line of James, the new 1st Baron, continued through his son (Sir) William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley in 1463, who was the first male issue from his 3rd marriage to Lady Isabel de Mowbray. This was after two previous marriages that yielded no children. On the opposing side of dispute were the descendants of the aforementioned Elizabeth Berkeley (James&#x27; the 1st Baron&#x27;s, 1st cousin) and in particular through her daughter Margaret (de Beauchamp) that shows some curious tangled sub-plots.

One such sub-plot lies with John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury who took Margaret de Beauchamp as his 2nd wife. His first marriage, to a Maud Neville (the daughter of his stepfather Thomas Neville, a Baron Furnivall) and which produced Lady Joan Talbot, amongst 6 children is however notable. The same John Talbot seemingly kidnapped and imprisoned until their death in 1452, the 3rd wife of James Berkeley (the 1st Baron) and mother of the aforementioned 2nd Baron Berkeley (Sir William de Berkeley). Yet, this James Berkeley, took a 4th wife, Lady Joan Talbot (i.e. the daughter of John Talbot who kidnapped his 3rd wife!).

A further sub-plot, or extension of the previous one, centres again around John Talbot but this time as a result of his marriage to Margaret de Beauchamp. Their eldest son, John Talbot, 1st Baron of Lisle and 1st Viscount Lisle, was the father of Thomas Talbot, 2nd Baron of Lisle and 2nd Viscount Lisle. This Thomas Talbot sought to exert his claim on the lands of Baron Berkeley on the death of his grandmother Margaret de Beauchamp (daughter of the disenfranchised Elizabeth Berkeley), who in the interim had continued to press her claim to Baron Berkeley lands against James Berkeley the 1st Baron. It brought him into direct opposition with Sir William de Berkeley (2nd Baron and son of James Berkeley and came to a full head at the Battle of Nibley Green (1470), following what is described as Thomas Talbot&#x27;s impetuous challenge to Sir William, which had concluded by the end of the following day with the death of Thomas Talbot and the subsequent sacking of his Manor at Wotton-under-Edge.

In the 16th century Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and brother of Jane Seymour (3rd wife Henry VIII) took over, and then lost, large estates including Brean, to which Steep Holm was allied. The marriage of his sister Jane and Henry VIII in 1536 coincided with him being made Viscount Beauchamp, potentially linking back to ancestral marriage between Sir Roger Seymour (c.1308 – Before 1366), who married Cicely, the eldest sister and heir of John de Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp. This may be related to the feudal Barony of Hatch Beauchamp, Somerset, previously held by his father Sir John Seymour.

The Seymour descendants recovered the estates, owning them into the 17th century, although the only activity on Steep Holm seems to have been the employment of gull watchers and fishermen. In 1684 the Norton Beauchamp estate (possibly in Kewstoke, Somerset, near Sand Bay, north of Weston-Super-Mare) was sold to Edward Ryder. It appears to have been auctioned by decree of the Court of Chancery 11 years later in 1695, possibly because of difficulties in maintaining sea defenses along the Somerset coast; however, this seems to have been disputed in the light of outstanding mortgages. In 1699 the estates, including Steep Holm, were sold to Philip Freke of Bristol, whose descendants held it for the next 130 years. Freke&#x27;s granddaughter married into the family of John Willes, who was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Member of Parliament. During their ownership, probably around 1776, a new cottage was built on Steep Holm for fishermen. It was built using stones from the ruined priory. In 1830 the island was sold again, according to some sources this was to a cousin of John Freke Willes named William Willes; however, other sources suggest it was to a solicitor in Weston-super-Mare named John Baker.

In 1832 the island was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who established an inn for sailors. The inn was run by the Harris family, using rum and tobacco bought from ships. They claimed that the island was outside the jurisdiction of the excise men until a court case in 1884. After the Harris family, the inn was run by Mr W. L. Davies, who offered fishing, shooting and boating holidays. To make landing on the island easier, a new pier was built close to the inn. In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.

===Palmerston Fort===

Both Steep Holm and Flat Holm were fortified in the 1860s as a defence against invasion. They form part of a line of defences, known as Palmerston Forts, built across the channel to protect the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff. The island was fortified following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, where they had been concerned at the strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under the direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast, and the island formed part of this strategic coastal defence system. Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 1869 by John Perry of Weston-super-Mare. The work involved the creation of a perimeter road around the summit plateau and a lime kiln for the manufacture of lime mortar to build the barracks and gun emplacements with their ammunition stores.

The concrete gun emplacements were called Summit Battery, Laboratory Battery, Garden Battery and Tombstone Battery. Along with the barracks they have been designated as Grade II listed buildings. The facilities installed included a master-gunners house, a small inn, and a water tank holding of rainwater. The water tank is beneath the barracks and collects rainwater from its roof. The brick tank is long, wide and high with a vaulted roof. Armaments included ten 7-inch rifled muzzle loaders Mk III spread between six batteries. These were later replaced with Armstrong 6-inch RML guns. Some of the gun batteries are scheduled monuments, and there are the remains of a centralised group of brick-built barrack blocks. In 1898 test firing by HMS &quot;Arrogant&quot;, an &quot;Arrogant&quot;-class cruiser, on Rudder Rock battery showed that the fixed gun emplacements used on Steep Holm and other sites were susceptible to attack by modern warships, and the site was no longer active. The military control on the island was maintained until 1908 when it was leased to James Sleeman and his family. In 1927 the first test of the RAE Larynx (from &quot;Long Range Gun with Lynx engine&quot;) an early pilotless aircraft, to be used as a guided anti-ship weapon, took place just off Steep Holm.

===World wars===

These facilities were updated in both World War I and World War II. From 1915 to 1919 the island was requisitioned by the Admiralty as a coastguard station. After the war the Sleemans returned to carry out farming and fishing and played host to occasional tourists. In World War II, search light batteries were built on Steep Holm. In 1940 the island&#x27;s warden, Harry Cox, who had developed the island into a bird sanctuary since 1931, was appointed as a coastguard and was supported by Local Defence Volunteers from Weston-super-Mare. In 1940 and 1941 the battery was refortified by soldiers from the Indian Army Service Corps using mules to transport guns and equipment up the steep cliffs. The armament included MarkVII6-inch breech-loading guns taken from World War I naval vessels which had been scrapped, and also included Lewis automatic machine guns against air attack. The Garden Battery was built over two Victorian stone gun emplacements. Engineers from the Royal Pioneer Corps improved the infrastructure including importing sheep to feed the soldiers and, after a case of typhoid fever, shipping drinking water from south Wales. To enable the movement of equipment, the engineers built a new jetty. This was linked to the plateau with a cable-operated winched switchback railway using prefabricated gauge lines which had been captured from the Germans in World War I. The Steep Holm batteries were also connected, by underwater telegraph cable, to the Brean Down Fort batteries, but parts of the cable were stolen for scrap after the end of World War II.

===Post war===

In 1953 the island was leased by the Steep Holm Trust supported by four local organisations: the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, Bristol Naturalists Society, Mid-Somerset Naturalists and the Bristol Folk House Archaeological Club. They repaired some of the buildings and established a bird ringing programme. In 1974 their lease expired and was taken over by the Kenneth Allsop Memorial Trust, a registered charity formed in memory of the broadcaster and naturalist Kenneth Allsop. The Trust purchased the island in 1976. The mission statement of the Trust is: &quot;To protect, preserve and enhance for the benefit of the public the landscape, antiquities, flora, fauna, natural beauty and scientific interest of the island of Steep Holm in the County of North Somerset and to advance the education of the public in the natural sciences.&quot;

Visits can be made to the island. The trust runs day-long boat trips from Weston-super-Mare. One barrack block is in use to provide visitor facilities. In 1980 the Bollywood film &quot;Shaan&quot; was set and partially filmed on the island.

The island is the focal point of the 2018 crime thriller &quot;Arcam&quot;, by Jason Minick.

<text>A blade&#x27;s grind is its cross-sectional shape in a plane normal to the edge. Grind differs from blade profile, which is the blade&#x27;s cross-sectional shape in the plane containing the blade&#x27;s edge and the centre contour of the blade&#x27;s back (meaning the shape of the blade when viewed from the side, i.e. clip point, spear point, etc.). The &quot;grind&quot; of a blade should not be confused with the bevel forming the sharpened edge; it more usually describes the overall cross-section of the blade, not inclusive of the beveled cutting edge which is typically of a different, less acute angle as the bevel ground onto the blade to give it a cross-sectional shape. For example, the famous Buck 110 hunting knife has a &quot;hollow ground&quot; blade, with concave blade faces (which aid in slicing through materials), but the cutting edge itself is a simple, flat-ground bevel of lesser angle. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to put a &quot;hollow grind&quot; onto the actual cutting edge of the blade itself, which is a very narrow and small bevel.

==Grinding==
Grinding is the process of creating grinds. It involves removing significant portions of material from a blade, which distinguishes it from honing and polishing. Blades are ground during their initial sharpening or after having been sufficiently damaged, such as by breaking a tip, chipping, or extensive corrosion. Well-maintained blades need grinding less frequently than neglected or maltreated ones do.

Edge angle and included angle typically characterize a blade&#x27;s grind. An edge angle is measured between a line lying in the plane of one of the edge&#x27;s faces and a second line intersecting the back&#x27;s centre contour, both lines lying in the same plane normal to the edge. The included angle is the sum of the edge angles. Ceteris paribus, the smaller the included angle, the sharper the blade and the more easily damaged its edge.

An appropriate grind depends upon a blade&#x27;s intended use and the material composing it. Knife manufacturers may offer the same blade with different grinds and blade owners may choose to regrind their blades to obtain different properties. A trade-off exists between a blade&#x27;s ability to take an edge and its ability to keep one. Some grinds are easier to maintain than others, better retaining their integrity as repeated sharpening wears away the blade. Harder steels take sharper edges, but are more brittle and hence chip more easily, whereas softer steels are tougher. The latter are used for knives such as cleavers, which must be tough but do not require a sharp edge. In the range of blade materials&#x27; hardnesses, the relationship between hardness and toughness is fairly complex and great hardness and great toughness are often possible simultaneously.

As a rough guide, Western kitchen knives are generally double-bevelled (about 15° on the first bevel and 20°–22° on the second), whereas East Asian kitchen knives, made of harder steel and being either wedge- (double-ground) to 15°–18° or chisel-shaped (single-ground) to 20°–30°.

Care should be taken to avoid confusing the grind of the blade as describing its cross-section and the angle that is ground onto the edge to form a cutting edge. It is very rare to have a knife with a single ground angle forming both the profile and the cutting edge (the exception being perhaps straight razors). For example, the famous Buck 110 folding hunting knife is described as having a &quot;hollow grind&quot; - meaning the faces of the blade are ground into a concave – but the blade also contains a second, less acute, conventional bevel that makes up the cutting edge. A classic Opinel folding knife has a &quot;flat grind&quot; blade, meaning that the faces of the blade are flat, without convexity or concavity, tapering towards the cutting edge: but the actual cutting edge is again formed of another, less acute bevel ground on the narrow edge. A classic Morakniv has a saber or &quot;Scandi&quot; grind, with flat, perpendicular sides on the body, with a secondary bevel formed below to create a tapered edge, but again, the actual cutting edge comprises a third, less-acute bevel. Thus the &quot;grind&quot; of the blade most often refers to the overall cross-section of the blade and should not be confused with the actual style of cutting edge put in the blade, even though this cutting edge is created by grinding as well. If the cutting edge was included in the description of the &quot;grind&quot;, the vast majority of blades would have to be described as &quot;compound angle grind&quot;. And of course one can purchase an unsharped blade in any style grind you desire, and there is rarely need to grind the entire surface of the blade to create a cutting edge.

== Process ==
A sharp object works by concentrating forces which creates a high pressure due to the very small area of the edge, but high pressures can nick a thin blade or even cause it to roll over into a rounded tube when it is used against hard materials. An irregular material or angled cut is also likely to apply much more torque to hollow-ground blades due to the &quot;lip&quot; formed on either side of the edge. More blade material can be included directly behind the cutting edge to reinforce it, but during sharpening some proportion of this material must be removed to reshape the edge, making the process more time-consuming. Also, any object being cut must be moved aside to make way for this wider blade section, and any force distributed to the grind surface reduces the pressure applied at the edge.

One way around this dilemma is to use the blade at an angle, which can make a blade&#x27;s grind seem less steep, much as a switchback makes a trail easier to climb. Using the edge in this way is made easier by introducing a curve in the blade, as seen in sabers, tulwars, shamshirs, and katanas, among many others. Some old European swords (most memorably Hrunting) and the Indonesian style of kris have a wavelike shape, with much the same effect in drawing or thrusting cuts.

If it is required to measure the angles of cutting edges, it is achieved by using a goniometer, or blade edge protractor.

== Typical grinds ==
Typical grinds include:

# Hollow grind: A knife blade ground to create a characteristic concave, beveled cutting edge. This is characteristic of straight razors, used for shaving, and yields a very sharp but weak edge, which requires stropping for maintenance.
# Flat grind: The blade tapers all the way from the spine to the edge from both sides. A lot of metal is removed from the blade, so it is thus more difficult to grind, which is one factor that limits its commercial use. It sacrifices edge durability in favor of more sharpness. A true flat-ground knife having only a single bevel is somewhat of a rarity (meaning that usually &quot;flat grind&quot; just describes the general shape of the blade, while there is a second, more conventional bevel ground creating the actual cutting edge, although this is generally true of most blade shapes; few knives are ground with one bevel angle comprising both the blade shape and the cutting edge).
# Sabre grind: Similar to a flat grind blade, except that the bevel starts at about the middle of the blade, not the spine. Also sometimes referred to as a &quot;V grind&quot;, made with strength in mind and found on tactical and military knives. A Sabre grind without a secondary bevel is called a &quot;Scandinavian (Scandi) grind&quot;, which is easier to sharpen due to the large surface. The Finnish puukko is an example of a Scandinavian-ground knife.
# Chisel grind: As on a chisel, a single bevel-ground is only on one side, (ground often at an edge angle of about 20°–30°); the other remains flat. As many Japanese culinary knives tend to be chisel-ground, they are often sharper than a typical double-bevelled Western culinary knife; a chisel grind has only a single edge angle; if a sabre-ground blade has the same edge angle as a chisel grind, it still has angles on both sides of the blade centreline, and so has twice the included angle. Knives that are chisel-ground come in left- and right-handed varieties, depending upon which side is ground. The flat side should be on the inside of the cut. Japanese knives feature subtle variations on the chisel grind. Firstly, the back side of the blade is often concave, to reduce drag and adhesion, so the food separates more cleanly; this feature is known as &quot;urasuki&quot;. Secondly, the &quot;kanisaki deba&quot;, used for cutting crab and other shellfish, has the grind on the &quot;opposite&quot; side (left side angled for right-handed use), so that the meat is not cut when chopping the shell. Chisel grinds excel in knives, where the top priority is getting the deepest cut and penetration with the least effort, but do wander when cutting rigid materials like cardboard and rubber.
# Double bevel or compound bevel: A back bevel, similar to a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This back bevel keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner, which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single-bevel grind, it sacrifices sharpness for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single-bevel blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the bevel is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double bevels are common in a variety of edge angles and back bevel angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have a double bevel, with an edge angle of 14–16° (included angle of 28–32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).
# Convex grind: Rather than tapering with straight lines to the edge, the taper is curved, though in the opposite manner to a hollow grind. Such a shape keeps a lot of metal behind the edge, making for a stronger edge while still allowing a good degree of sharpness. This grind can be used on axes and is sometimes called an &quot;axe grind&quot;. As the angle of the taper is constantly changing, this type of grind requires some degree of skill to reproduce on a flat stone. Convex blades usually need to be made from thicker stock than other blades. This is also known as &quot;hamaguriba&quot; in Japanese kitchen knives, both single- and double-beveled. Hamaguriba means &quot;clam-shaped edge&quot;.

It is possible to combine grinds or produce other variations. For example, some blades may be flat-ground for much of the blade but be convex ground towards the edge.

<doc id="635184" wikidata="Q4302461" url="?curid=635184" title="New Norcia Station">
<text>New Norcia Station (also known as NNO) is an ESTRACK Earth station in Australia for communication with spacecraft after launch, in low Earth orbit, in geostationary orbit and in deep space. It is located south of the town of New Norcia, Western Australia. It was the first ESA deep space ground station, followed by Cebreros Station and Malargüe Station.

New Norcia Station was one of the stations providing communications, tracking and data download from the Rosetta spacecraft. It supports the BepiColombo mission.

==History==
Construction began in April 2000 and lasted until the end of the first half of 2002. Installation of electronics and communication equipment followed. The station was officially opened on 5 March 2003 by the Premier of Western Australia at the time, Geoff Gallop. Total construction cost was .

In December 2019, ESA announced plans to build a second deep space antenna at New Norcia to provide coverage for upcoming ESA missions, including Solar Orbiter, &quot;Hera&quot;, and Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer. This The antenna 

Since June 2019, operational support and maintenance of the station has been the responsibility of CSIRO.

==NNO-1==

The station operates a dish designated NNO-1 capable of two-way transmission in both S- and X-bands using 2 and 20-kilowatt transmitters, as well as cryogenic low noise amplifiers for downlink. The antenna weighs over and is tall. Future upgrade plans include adding a Ka-band station to support international missions.

==NNO-2==

A dish designated NNO-2 was inaugurated on 11 February 2016. NNO-2 acts as an acquisition aid for the dish for fast-moving satellites and launch vehicles during their launch and early orbit stage.

The NNO-2 mount is capable of tracking at 20 degrees per second in azimuth and 10 degrees per second in elevation.

The dish has a half-power beam width of 1.9 degrees at S-band and 0.5 degrees at X-band and can be used to communicate with spacecraft up to in altitude. To help in signal acquisition when the spacecraft position is too uncertain, the dish has a dish piggy-backed onto it, with a half-power beam width of 3.5 degrees at X-band. There is no S-band capability on the dish.

NNO-2 may also be operated independently of NNO-1, as it commonly does during support activities for launches of Ariane 5, Vega, and Soyuz rockets from the Guiana Space Centre.

==NNO-3==
, construction of the NNO-3 antenna at New Norcia is ongoing. The new antenna is being built to the same mechanical specification as NNO-1, utilising a main reflector on a mount capable of 1 degree-per-second tracking in both azimuth and elevation, by a consortium of companies. Once complete, the antenna will support X-, K- and Ka-bands uplink and downlink, and has provision for a future 100kW class X-uplink.

==Biomass Calibration Transponder==
A 435MHz (also called P-band) transponder is currently (in 2024) being commissioned for the upcoming Biomass spacecraft. This antenna will enable calibration of the spacecraft during its mission to map Earth&#x27;s bio-matter.

<doc id="635189" wikidata="Q210362" url="?curid=635189" title="Joseph Nye">
<text>Joseph Samuel Nye Jr. (born January 19, 1937) is an American political scientist. He and Robert Keohane co-founded the international relations theory of neoliberalism, which they developed in their 1977 book &quot;Power and Interdependence&quot;. Together with Keohane, he developed the concepts of asymmetrical and complex interdependence. They also explored transnational relations and world politics in an edited volume in the 1970s. More recently, he pioneered the theory of soft power. His notion of &quot;smart power&quot; (&quot;the ability to combine hard and soft power into a successful strategy&quot;) became popular with the use of this phrase by members of the Clinton Administration and the Obama Administration. These theories from Nye are very commonly seen in courses across the U.S., such as I.B. D.P. Global Politics. 

Nye is the former Dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he currently holds the position of University Distinguished Service Professor, Emeritus. In October 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry appointed Nye to the Foreign Affairs Policy Board. He is also a member of the Defense Policy Board. He has been a Harvard faculty member since 1964. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences, a foreign fellow of the British Academy, and a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy.

The 2011 Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) survey of over 1,700 international relations scholars ranked Nye as the sixth most influential scholar in the field of international relations in the past 20 years. He was also ranked as one of the most influential figures in American foreign policy. In 2011, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine included him on its list of top global thinkers. In September 2014, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; reported that international relations scholars and policymakers ranked Nye as one of the field&#x27;s most influential scholars.

==Life and career==
===Education===

Nye attended Morristown Prep (now the Morristown–Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey and graduated in 1954. He then attended Princeton University, from where he graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a B.A. in history in 1958. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and won the Myron T. Herrick Thesis Prize. His senior thesis was titled &quot;Death of a Family Firm: An Entrepreneurial History of the American Preserve Company.&quot; During his time at Princeton, Nye was vice president of the Colonial Club, a columnist for The Daily Princetonian, and a member of the American Whig–Cliosophic Society&#x27;s Debate Panel. After studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University&#x27;s Exeter College, he obtained his PhD in political science from Harvard University in 1964. Nye&#x27;s doctoral dissertation was on regional integration in East Africa.

===Career===
Nye joined the Harvard faculty in 1964 and served as Director of the Center for Science and International Affairs at John F. Kennedy School of Government from 1985 to 1990 and as Associate Dean for International Affairs at Harvard University from 1989 to 1992. Nye also served as Director of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University from 1989 to 1993 and Dean of John F. Kennedy School of Government from 1995 to 2004. Nye is currently (as of July 2018) University Distinguished Service Professor, Emeritus.

Nye and his colleague Keohane have been characterized as key figures in the development of a discipline of international political economy, largely as a result of their authorship of &quot;Power and Interdependence&quot;. Nye&#x27;s influences include Karl Deutsch and Ernst Hass.

From 1977 to 1979, Nye was Deputy to the Undersecretary of State for Security Assistance, Science, and Technology and chaired the National Security Council Group on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In recognition of his service, he was awarded the State Department&#x27;s Distinguished Honor Award in 1979. In 1993 and 1994, he was Chairman of the National Intelligence Council, which coordinates intelligence estimates for the President, and was awarded the Intelligence Community&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal. In the Clinton Administration from 1994 to 1995, Nye served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, and was awarded the Department&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster. Nye was considered by many to be the preferred choice for National Security Advisor in the 2004 presidential campaign of John Kerry.

He is the chairman of the North American branch of the Trilateral Commission and the co-chair of the Aspen Strategy Group. He is also a member of the Atlantic Council&#x27;s Board of Directors. Nye has also served as a trustee of Radcliffe College and Wells College. He was on the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Guiding Coalition of the Project on National Security Reform, the Advisory Board of Carolina for Kibera, and the Board of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He has been awarded the Woodrow Wilson Prize by Princeton University and the Charles E. Merriman Prize by the American Political Science Association. In 2005, he was awarded the Honorary Patronage of the University Philosophical Society of Trinity College Dublin and has been awarded honorary degrees by ten colleges and universities. In 2010, Nye won the Foreign Policy Distinguished Scholar Award from the International Studies Association. In 2009, he was made a Theodore Roosevelt Fellow of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.

In October 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry appointed Nye to the Foreign Affairs Policy Board. The group meets periodically to discuss strategic questions and to provide the Secretary and other senior Department officials with independent informed perspectives and ideas. In November 2014, Nye was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star in recognition of his &quot;contribution to the development of studies on Japan-U.S. security and to the promotion of the mutual understanding between Japan and the United States.&quot;

Nye serves as a Commissioner for the Global Commission on Internet Governance, and served on the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace from 2017 until its conclusion in 2019. He currently serves on the global Advisory Council for CFK Africa, a leading NGO working in Kenyan informal settlements.

Nye coined the term soft power in the late 1980s, and it first came into widespread usage following a piece he wrote in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; in 1990. Nye has consistently written for &quot;Project Syndicate&quot; since 2002.

===Personal life===
Nye and his wife, Molly Harding Nye, have three adult sons. He is a member of a Unitarian Universalist Association church.

=== Significant views ===
Nye is a neo-liberal.

In Nye&#x27;s view, analysis of collective security systems requires consideration of economic matters. Matters of collective economic security include common goods, the presence or absence of trade restrictions, and distribution of profits between countries.

<doc id="635191" wikidata="Q894075" url="?curid=635191" title="Borough of Barrow-in-Furness">
<text>Barrow-in-Furness was a local government district with borough status in Cumbria, England. It was named after its main town, Barrow-in-Furness. Other settlements included Dalton-in-Furness and Askam-in-Furness. It was the smallest district in Cumbria, but the most densely populated, with 924 people per square kilometre. The population was 71,980 in 2001, reducing to 69,087 at the 2011 Census.

In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, Cumbria would be reorganised into two unitary authorities. On 1 April 2023, Barrow-in-Furness Borough Council was abolished and its functions transferred to the new authority Westmorland and Furness, which also covers the former districts of Eden and South Lakeland.

== Background ==
The area covered by the district was at the edge of the Furness peninsula. It jolted into the Irish Sea, being north of Morecambe Bay and south of the Duddon Estuary. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the former county borough of Barrow-in-Furness and the Dalton-in-Furness urban district from the administrative county of Lancashire. Despite being one of England&#x27;s smallest local authorities it had a coastline of 63 km and has equally diverse built and natural environments. This included 274 Listed buildings and four SSSIs, ranking as the seventh highest concentration of 325 districts on the English Heritage Index as of 2015.

== Barrow Borough Council ==

Barrow-in-Furness Borough Council sat at the Town Hall in Barrow. It was led by a mayor, who was elected by council members. In 2006, the Council was fined £125,000 for violation of health and safety laws that led to the deaths of seven people in the United Kingdom&#x27;s worst outbreak of Legionnaires&#x27; disease. The council also became the UK&#x27;s first public body to be charged with corporate manslaughter, but was found not guilty.

Following boundary changes in 2008, the council was composed of 36 seats, elected across 13 wards. From 2011 the council switched from the previous system of elections occurring over a four-year cycle, with a third of seats elected each year and one &#x27;fallow&#x27; year, to one where full council elections occur every four years.

From its inception in 1973 until abolition in 2023, the council was often under Labour control, most recently from the 2011 election, but with three years of Conservative control (1976–1979) and ten years of no overall control (most recently from 2006 to 2011).

Composition at abolition


== Council wards ==
The Borough of Barrow-in-Furness comprised thirteen electoral wards, all of which can be seen on the map below.

<text>Quadragesimo anno () (Latin for &quot;In the 40th Year&quot;) is an encyclical issued by Pope Pius XI on 15 May 1931, 40 years after Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, further developing Catholic social teaching. Unlike Leo XIII, who addressed the condition of workers, Pius XI discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism, from socialism, and from communism as practised in Russia. He also calls for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity.

Essential contributors to the formulation of the encyclical were the German Jesuits, Roman Catholic theologians and social philosophers Gustav Gundlach and the &quot;Königswinter Circle&quot; through one of its main authors Oswald von Nell-Breuning.

==Changes since &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;==
Pope Pius XI issued his encyclical exactly forty years after &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;. In the interim there were other papal statements from Leo XIII, and also the encyclical &quot;Singulari quadam&quot; of Pius X. Pius XI subtitled his encyclical &quot;Reconstruction of the Social Order&quot;. In the first part he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor. The Catholic Church can be credited with participating in the progress made and contributing to it. It developed a new social conscience.

==Private property==
The Church has a vital role in discussing social and economic issues, not in their technical, but their moral and ethical aspects. This includes the nature of private property, concerning which several conflicting views had developed within the Catholic Church. Pius XI proclaims private property to be essential for the development and freedom of the individual, which are Christian values not to be denied. But, says Pius, private property has a social function as well, and it loses its moral value if it is not subordinated to the common good. Therefore, governments have a right to pursue redistribution policies, and in extreme cases to expropriate private property.

==Capital and labour==
A related issue, says Pius, is the relation between capital and labour and the determination of fair wages. The Church considers it perverse in industrial society to have fiercely opposed social classes based on income. He welcomes all attempts to alleviate this strife and ameliorate its causes. Three elements determine a fair wage: The needs of the worker and his family, the economic condition of the enterprise, and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pius XI concludes that what is needed is not class conflict between worker and employer but solidarity, given the mutual interdependence of the parties involved.

==Social order==
Industrialization, says Pius XI, resulted in less freedom at the individual and communal level, because numerous free social entities were absorbed by larger ones. A society of individuals became a mass and class society. Today people are much less interdependent than in ancient times, and become egoistic or class-conscious in order to recover some freedom for themselves. The pope demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication. Pius draws a negative view of capitalism, especially of the anonymous international finance markets. He deplores that small and medium-size enterprises with insufficient access to capital markets are often squeezed or destroyed by big business. He warns that capital interests can endanger states, potentially reducing them to &quot;chained slaves of individual interests&quot;. The encyclical has been an important inspiration to modern distributist thought on seeking greater solidarity and subsidiarity than present capitalism.

Pius mostly reaffirms the importance of traditional gender roles, emphasizing the importance of a family wage for fathers:

==Communism and socialism==
Regarding communism and socialism, Pius XI notes increasing differences. He condemns communism but also the social conditions which nourish it. He wants moderate socialism to distance itself from totalitarian communism as a practical matter and also on principle, in light of the dignity of the human person. Dignity and human freedom are ethical considerations which cannot be ensured by hostile class confrontation. Ethics are based on religion and this is the realm where the Church meets industrial society.

117 &quot;Whether considered as a doctrine, or an historical fact, or a movement, Socialism, if it remains truly Socialism, even after it has yielded to truth and justice on the points which we have mentioned, cannot be reconciled with the teachings of the Catholic Church because its concept of society itself is utterly foreign to Christian truth.&quot;

118 &quot;Socialism, on the other hand, wholly ignoring and indifferent to this sublime end of both man and society, affirms that human association has been instituted for the sake of material advantage alone.&quot;

==Reception==
Ramsay MacDonald, the head of the British affiliate of the Socialist International, inquired of Cardinal Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster, on how the encyclical&#x27;s statements on socialism applied to Catholics voting for or participating in socialist parties. The Cardinal stated &quot;There is nothing in the encyclical which should deter Catholics from becoming members of the British Labour Party.&quot;

Franklin D. Roosevelt had high praise for the encyclical and quoted it extensively on the evils of concentrated economic power.

<text>Kardeş Türküler (translated either as Brotherly Songs or as Ballads of Fraternity) is a contemporary Turkish ethnic/folkloric band. It was formed in 1993 with a series of stage performances given by the music branch of the Folklore Club at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, Turkey.

==Origins==
The diverse ethnic groups in this ancient Anatolia region and the Balkans initially gave cause for the concerts to have artists perform interpretations of Anatolian folksongs in Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Assyrian, Azerbaijani, Georgian and Armenian. Under the auspices of the Boğaziçi Performing Arts Ensemble (BGST), formed in 1995, the program used the concert stage to advance the ideals of common ancestry and celebration of diversity as a to cultural polarization and ethnic tension. Eventually, the musical heritage of the Laz, Georgian, Circassian, Romani, Macedonian and Alevi cultures were all incorporated into the program. The scholarly collection and research of the diverse folklore traditions of the region is an important part of BGST’s activities, but Kardeş Türküler has been intent on forging its own music tradition as well.

<text>Pontrhydfendigaid () is a village in Ceredigion, Wales. It lies on the western flank of the Cambrian Mountains, between Devil&#x27;s Bridge and Tregaron. The village lies on the River Teifi, whose source is just 3 miles (5 km) to the east at Llyn Teifi. The community of Ystrad Fflur, which Pontrhydfendigaid makes most of the population of, had a population of 712 as of 2011 census.

The ruins of the Cistercian Strata Florida Abbey are 1 mile south-east of the village. The abbey was founded 1164; the poet Dafydd ap Gwilym is traditionally said to be buried there and Llywelyn the Great held a council there. The station at Strata Florida was positioned to serve the village. The hillfort of Pen y Bannau is 1 km east of the village.

The village is home to an annual eisteddfod, the Eisteddfod Pantyfedwen, or colloquially the &quot;Steddfod Bont&quot;. Concerts and other events are also held in the modern multi-purpose Pavilion here. A Celtic Music Society is based at the village&#x27;s Black Lion Hotel.

The village was the birthplace and home of Caradog Jones, the first Welshman to reach the summit of Mount Everest.

It is in the Community of Ystrad Fflur.

The village takes its name from an old ford () across the Teifi and a bridge () that was later built there. It is on the B4343 road between Tregaron to the south and Pontarfynach to the north, around 13 miles (21 km) to the south-east of Aberystwyth.

The abbey was an important centre of learning, and it is believed that one of the earliest versions of the &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; was made there.

It is believed that the TV programme &quot;C&#x27;mon Midffild!&quot; is based on the village football club.

==Pontrhydfendigaid in fiction==
In the novel The Discovery of Heaven by Dutch author Harry Mulisch, the village is the place where the characters Mr and Mrs Spiers spend their holidays.

==The Beast of Bont==
The Beast of Bont is the name given to a big cat said to roam the area centred on Pontrhydfendigaid. (Y Bont is the local abbreviation and colloquial name for Pontrhydfendigaid.) It was blamed for the death of 12 sheep in June 1981. After a number of livestock attacks in the mid-1990s, Ministry of Agriculture veterinarians inspected a sheep carcass &quot;and declared that the killer was a great deal more powerful than a fox or dog&quot;. The Dyfed-Powys police then searched the area, but failed to find the animal.

In the spring of 2012, Mark Davey and his partner Annette came across a &quot;sickening&quot; scene: two large groups of slaughtered sheep, about two miles apart, in the hills near Devil&#x27;s Bridge. In a statement to local newspapers, he reported that &quot;something had quite clearly attacked them because they looked like they had been ripped apart&quot; and that &quot;to kill so many sheep in such a small area it had to be quite a strong animal&quot;.

<text>The Primary (formerly the Primary Association) is the children&#x27;s organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It acts as a Sunday school organization for the church&#x27;s children (ages 3–11).

==Purpose, objectives, and theme==

The official purpose of Primary is to help parents in teaching their children to learn and live the gospel of Jesus Christ. The official objectives of Primary are to:

*Teach children that they are children of God and that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love them;
*help children learn to love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ;
*help children prepare to be baptized, to receive the Holy Ghost, and to keep their baptismal covenants;
*help children grow in their understanding of the gospel plan and provide opportunities for them to live gospel principles;
*help boys prepare to receive the priesthood and be worthy to use this power to bless and serve others; and
*help girls prepare to be righteous young women, understand the blessings of the priesthood and the temple, and serve others.

The Primary theme is &quot;All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children&quot; (Isaiah 54:13).

== Format ==
While Primary classes will differ slightly in different regions, most meetings are standardized. For the second half of Primary, children are separated into age groups with names for each group (see below).

Where participants, classrooms or teachers are limited, multiple age-grouped classes may be taught together. In most congregations, Primary classes are co-ed.

Primary begins with a prayer, scripture (or Article of Faith), and a short talk, all of these given by Primary children. About 20 minutes are then spent on music, primarily from the Children&#x27;s Songbook. After music time, children are then sent to their individual classes where they are taught lessons from Come, Follow Me - For Primary.

===Class names===
The names of the classes in Primary have varied over time. The following is a partial list of names that have been applied to different age groups in Primary. In January 2010, the names of the classes were changed to the age of children entering the class, i.e., 4-year-olds are in the class CTR 4. Previously, names were indicative of the age children would turn the coming year, (4-year-olds in CTR 5).
== Nursery ==

A separate class, known as nursery, is held for children ages 18 months to 3. It is led under the direction of the Primary presidency by at least two people, a nursery leader and assistant nursery leader(s). Nursery leaders are required to be the same gender unless they are married.

Nursery classes have a lesson, free play time, snack time, and music time primarily using the Children&#x27;s Songbook. Additionally, two prayers are given by children with help from the adult leaders. While no particular order is required, it is recommended that the order be the same every week.

Teachers use the &quot;Behold Your Little Ones: Nursery Manual&quot; for lesson plans and other resources.

==History==
Primary was first organized in 1878 by Aurelia Spencer Rogers in Farmington, Utah, and adopted church-wide in 1880 under the direction of Louie B. Felt, who served as the president of the organization through 1925. Rogers was concerned because younger Latter-day Saint children had too much unsupervised time due to the long hours that fathers and older sons kept on the farms and mothers and older daughters in the home. In particular, Rogers felt that the younger boys in the community were becoming unruly and mischievous. With permission from church leaders and under the initial direction of General Relief Society President Eliza R. Snow, Rogers organized a Primary Association for her local Farmington congregation on August 11, 1878. Two weeks later, the first meeting was held on August 28, with 215 children in attendance. That day, boys were specifically taught not to steal fruit from orchards and girls were taught not to hang on wagons. In addition, they were given lessons on faith, manners, obedience, and other principles.

May Anderson, the Primary general president from 1925 to 1939, initiated what became Primary Children&#x27;s Hospital in Salt Lake City (now part of Intermountain Health). Anderson also helped establish kindergartens in Utah. In the 1970s, as a result of the Priesthood Correlation Program, the Primary Association was renamed &quot;Primary&quot;.

Beginning in April 2021, Camille N. Johnson was the Primary General President, with Susan H. Porter as First Counselor and Amy Wright as Second Counselor. 

In the church&#x27;s April 2022 general conference, it was announced that Johnson would become the new Relief Society General President on August 1, 2022. As a result, on that date, Porter became the new Primary General President, with Wright serving as First Counselor and Tracy Y. Browning as Second Counselor.

=== Chronology of the general presidency of the Primary ===

==Primary in the church today==
Primary provides Sunday teachings and church-related activities to approximately 1.1 million Latter-day Saint children. In most congregations, a nursery class is available for children from 18 months to age 3. Classroom instruction begins for three-year-olds and continues to age 11, with classes grouped by age. At the beginning of the year they turn 12, children begin to attend Sunday School and the Young Men or Young Women programs. The Primary has its own songbook, made up of original songs and hymns modified for children.

== Child safety ==
All members called to serve in a position that deals with youth or children are required to take the Church&#x27;s &quot;Protecting Children and Youth&quot; training module which is provided on the church&#x27;s website.

Nursery and Primary leaders are required to release children only to members of their immediate families unless permission has been granted for someone else to pick the child up.

<doc id="635212" wikidata="Q786356" url="?curid=635212" title="Autocross">
<text>Autocross is a form of motorsport in which competitors are timed to complete a short course using automobiles on a dirt or grass surface, excepting where sealed surfaces are used in United States. Rules vary according to the governing or sanctioning body, such as the length of the course, the amount of permitted attempts, or whether competitors start the course individually at intervals or at the same time as others. In this latter form, Autocross differs from other forms of motor racing by using a system of heats or alternative timing methods for the classification rather than racing for position and declaring the first across the finish line as the winner.

Autocross began in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s at an amateur level within local motor clubs using temporary courses marked on grassy fields to not cause damage to any cars. The creator of rallycross, Robert Reed, wanted a version of autocross with more spectator-appeal to be made for television, using professional racing and rally drivers and teams; and courses featuring jumps, sharper corners and a mixture of sealed and unsealed surfaces.

In the United States, the motorsport called autocross is more like the UK and European sport of &quot;Autotesting&quot; or &quot;Autoslalom&quot;, and what is called rallycross in the US is more like what the UK and Europe call autocross. The Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) publishes rules for autocross, which are also used by many independent clubs, as well as hosting national events and championships within its &quot;Solo&quot; branded series. The National Auto Sport Association brands its version of US-style autocross as &quot;NASA-X,&quot; Both take place on sealed asphalt or concrete surfaces, one car at a time running against the clock, with traffic cones defining the path to be driven, and an emphasis on car handling and precision manoeuvring.

Autocross courses can be as short as 800 metres or several kilometres long. Courses may be temporary and marked by traffic cones which can be reconfigured during events, or be permanent tracks with approval by a motorsport body.

Events typically have many classes that allow almost any vehicle, from production touring cars to purpose-built racing cars. The international body for autocross, the FIA, and the French body, FFSA, both provide technical specifications for &quot;cross cars&quot;, lightweight buggy cars.

==Australia==

Australian Autocross was sanctioned by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport, which defined it as a speed event held on a dirt course less than two kilometres long. Eligible vehicles ranged from standard road-going cars through to purpose-built buggies to full racing or rallying-prepared machines. Drivers could begin competing at the age of 14 and must have held a recognised racing licence, which was usually obtainable on the day through the hosting club.

==United States==
American autocross events (also called &quot;Solo&quot;, Auto-x&quot; or &quot;Autoslalom&quot;) are typically held on flat, paved surfaces such as parking lots or airport tarmacs, and usually have a new course for each event, marked by traffic cones.

Autocross is one of the most accessible and affordable forms of motorsport, and autocross events are open to novices. Because autocross events use rubber traffic cones to define the course, and are typically run on paved surfaces with few obstructions, the hazards and barriers to entry are low. While speeds are generally no greater than those encountered in legal highway driving, the combination of concentration and precision manoeuvring gives drivers an experience similar to that of a full road course race. 
Competitors range from casual participants driving their commuter vehicles, to dedicated competitors driving purpose-built cars with special tires. There are classes accommodating varying degrees of car modification, as well as classes specifically for women and children.

Many events are open to spectators. Many local car clubs offer autocross novice driving schools to help drivers feel comfortable before a regular event.

The SCCA National Championship is held in September in the Midwest. Currently (2024 and prior) held in Lincoln, Nebraska. The event takes place over 4 days with half the drivers competing on the first two days and half the last two days. Two different courses are driven with winners determined by combining best times from both courses. It is considered the largest amateur motorsport racing event in the world; for 2024, registration was capped at 1,300 drivers with a number of additional people on a wait list.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, autocrosses are typically held on a grass or stubble surface. Cars compete individually against the clock, although more than one car may start at the same time if the circuit is long enough and wide enough. Because the course is usually bumpy and there is a risk of contact with other cars, most competitors use specially prepared cars (which vary from very inexpensive to specially engineered racers) brought on trailers. Events are usually held on a region-wide basis, with Motorsport UK overseeing rules and regulations.

Some people choose to start singularly, particularly if they compete in a rally car. The sport is relatively low risk as there is or should be nothing to hit. However, if you wish, you may do double car starts. Most people opt for this, although some competitors choose to do 3 and 4 car starts whilst still competing against the clock.

=== History ===
The British autocross began in the early 1950s when clubs organized timed runs around courses set on farmers&#x27; fields. By 1954, Taunton MC organized the first ever autocross series in the United Kingdom. This, however, was only repeated in 1959 when the club was awarded the permit to hold the British National Autocross event. Shortly, thereafter, the sporting event caught on and, by 1963, the ASWMC Autocross Championship was finally launched.

Presently, there are many local clubs which host across the UK, although the main regions hosting Autocross events are: AEMC for East Anglia, ANECCC - North East, and, the ASWMC for the South-West region. The ASWMC, for its part, now has 13 different Championships, which attract around 250 contenders each year. The regional autocross events also have different formats. For instance, the South West follows the traditional two-car start, except for the 4 abreast Sandocross that used to run at Weston-super-Mare, while the North East region involves 4-car autocross.

== FIA European Autocross Championship ==

Cars compete against the clock, and start at the same time. A well attended international series is the FIA European Championship for Autocross Drivers. The FIA European Autocross Championship is a racing competition held on natural terrain circuits with unsealed surfaces ranging from 800 to 1,400 metres in length. Up to 10 cars race simultaneously in qualifying heats, followed by two semi-finals and a final race. It features different categories for &quot;buggies&quot;, including SuperBuggy, Buggy1600, and JuniorBuggy. Events also host rounds of the FIA European Cross Car Championship and FIA Cross Car Academy Trophy for younger drivers aged between 13 and 16 years old.

FIA European Autocross Championship was established as an FIA European Cup in 1977 and was upgraded to an FIA European Championship in 1982. Since 2021, a selection of the ten FIA European Autocross Championship events also host rounds of the FIA European Cross Car Championship (7 competitions in 2022) and the FIA Cross Car Academy Trophy (5 competitions in 2022, reserved for drivers aged 13 to 16).

The championship is run on circuits on natural terrain, with any type of unsealed surface, from 800 to 1,400 metres in length. Autocross races involve a maximum of 10 cars on track simultaneously and consist of a succession of qualifying heats leading to two semi-finals and a final.

The championship has a series of events throughout the year in various locations. For example, in 2022, the events were held in places like Seelow, Vilkyčiai, Nová Paka, Saint-Georges-de-Montaigu, Přerov, Saint-Igny de Vers, Maggiora, and Mollerussa.

==Related sports==
In the US, both autocross and slalom are disciplines included in the SCCA&#x27;s branded time trial series, &quot;Solo,&quot; and the terms are commonly used interchangeably. Other regions of the world use different names. Parts of Canada and Eastern Europe (including Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova) have an autoslalom discipline and events. In the United Kingdom, the closest discipline to autocross is known as autosolo. In Malaysia and Thailand it is known as autokhana.

Motorkhana (Australia and New Zealand) and autotesting (the UK and Ireland) are also similar disciplines. With speeds rarely exceeding 40 mph (60 km/h), motorkhana and autotesting are slower than American autocross, require hand-braking, and have sections that must be navigated in reverse. Autocross speeds can exceed 60 mph (100 km/h), and courses requiring drivers to reverse are generally prohibited. Hand-braking is also uncommon, and not usually necessary on a typical autocross course.

They are similar to the Japanese gymkhana, another type of handling competition. Gymkhanas are tighter than motorkhanas and autotests, with numerous 360-degree turns around cones and courses which loop back on themselves. Fast times require sliding, and resembles a combination of autocross and drifting. Gymkhana does not usually require backing up. In ProSolo, an SCCA-sanctioned programme of autocross, two cars run side by side on mirror-image courses after starting at a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; starting system similar to that used in drag racing.

<text>The Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) is a discontinued operating system first developed at Dartmouth College between 1963 and 1964. It was the first successful large-scale time-sharing system to be implemented, and was also the system for which the BASIC language was developed. DTSS was developed continually over the next decade, reimplemented on several generations of computers, and finally shut down in 1999.

General Electric developed a similar system based on an interim version of DTSS, which they referred to as Mark II. Mark II and the further developed Mark III were widely used on their GE-600 series mainframe computers and formed the basis for their online services. These were the largest such services in the world for a time, eventually emerging as the consumer-oriented GEnie online service.

Professors John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth College purchased a Royal McBee LGP-30 computer around 1959, which was programmed by undergraduates in assembly language. Kurtz and four students programmed the Dartmouth ALGOL 30 compiler, an implementation of the ALGOL 58 programming language, which two of the students, Stephen Garland and Anthony Knapp then evolved into the SCALP (Self Contained ALgol Processor) language between 1962 and 1964. Kemeny and freshman Sidney Marshall collaborated to create DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment), which was used in large freshman courses.

Kurtz approached Kemeny in either 1961 or 1962, with the following proposal: all Dartmouth students would have access to computing, it should be free and open-access, and this could be accomplished by creating a time-sharing system (which Kurtz had learned about from colleague John McCarthy at MIT, who suggested &quot;why don&#x27;t you guys do timesharing?&quot;). Although it has been stated that DTSS was inspired by a PDP-1-based time-sharing system at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, there is no evidence that this is true.

In 1962, Kemeny and Kurtz submitted a proposal for the development of a new time-sharing system to NSF (which was ultimately funded in 1964). They had sufficient assurance that both Dartmouth and NSF would support the system that they signed a contract with GE and began preliminary work in 1963, before the proposal was funded. In particular, they evaluated candidate computers from Bendix, GE, and IBM, and settled upon the GE-225 system paired with a DATANET-30 communications processor. This two-processor approach was unorthodox, and Kemeny later recalled: &quot;At that time, many experts at GE and elsewhere, tried to convince us that the route of the two-computer solution was wasteful and inefficient.&quot; In essence, the DATANET-30 provided the user-interface and scheduler, while user programs ran in the GE-225.

Its implementation began in 1963, by a student team under the direction of Kemeny and Kurtz with the aim of providing easy access to computing facilities for all members of the college. The GE-225 and DATANET-30 computers arrived in February 1964. Two students, John McGeachie and Michael Busch, wrote the operating systems for the DATANET-30 and GE-225; Kemeny contributed the BASIC compiler. The system became operational in mid March, and on May 1, 1964, at 4:00 a.m., the system began operations. In autumn of 1964, hundreds of freshman students began to use the system via 20 teletypes, with access at Hanover High School via one additional teletype; later that autumn the GE-225 computer was replaced with a faster GE-235 computer with minimal issues. By summer of 1965, the system could support forty simultaneous users.

A Dartmouth document from October 1964, later revised by GE, describes the overall DTSS architecture: 
The program in the Datanet-30 is divided into two parts, a real-time part and a spare-time part. The real-time part is entered via clock-controlled interrupt 110 times per second in order to scan the teletype lines. As characters are completed, the real-time part collects them into messages and, when a &quot;return&quot; character is encountered, interprets the message. If it is a line in the program, nothing is done. If the message is a command, a spare-time task to start carrying out the command is set up and inserted in the spare-time list. If there is not enough time to complete this setting-up, the real-time part will complete the set-up during the next real-time period. The spare-time portion carries out the spare-time tasks, which include mainly disc operations and certain teletype operations. In the GE-235 part there is resident compiler system that acts as a translator, and a resident executive routine to manage the disc input-output operations and to perform other functions. The executive system permits simultaneous use of the card equipment, the tape drives, and the high-speed printer during time-sharing through interrupt processing. Two algebraic languages, BASIC and ALGOL, are available, with FORTRAN planned for September 1965. These one-pass compilers are rather fast, requiring usually 1 to 4 seconds per compilation.

==User interface design==
Kemeny and Kurtz observed that &quot;any response time which averages more than 10 seconds destroys the illusion of having one&#x27;s own computer&quot;, so DTSS&#x27;s design emphasized immediate feedback. Many of its users thus believed that their terminal was the computer and that, Kemeny wrote, &quot;the machine is there just to serve him and that he has complete control of the entire system&quot;.

Because of the educational aims, ease of use was a priority in DTSS design. It implemented the world&#x27;s first Integrated Design Environment (IDE). Any line typed in by the user, and beginning with a line number, was added to the program, replacing any previously stored line with the same number; anything else was taken as a command and immediately executed. Lines which consisted solely of a line number weren&#x27;t stored but did remove any previously stored line with the same number. This method of editing provided a simple and easy to use service that allowed large numbers of teleprinters as the terminal units for the Dartmouth Timesharing system.

IDE commands included

* CATALOG – to list previously named programs in storage
* LIST – to display the current program in memory
* NEW – to name and begin writing a program in memory
* OLD – to copy a previously named program from storage to memory
* RENAME – to change the name of the program in memory
* RUN – to compile and execute the current program in memory
* SAVE – to copy the current program from memory to storage
* SCRATCH – to clear the content of the current program from memory
* UNSAVE – to remove the current program from storage

These commands were often believed to be part of the BASIC language by users, but in fact they were part of the time sharing system and were also used when preparing ALGOL or FORTRAN programs via the DTSS terminals.

==GE-Dartmouth relationship==
Kemeny and Kurtz had originally hoped that GE would enter into a research partnership, and to that end Kurtz and student Anthony Knapp authored a document about their proposed system design, which they presented to GE&#x27;s Phoenix office in 1962. However, GE rejected the partnership, and its October 1962 proposal to Dartmouth was framed solely as a commercial sale. That said, GE and Dartmouth promoted the operational Dartmouth Time Sharing System in October 1964 at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, with three teletypes connected to the Dartmouth system in Hanover.

From December 1964 into January 1965, two Dartmouth students installed working copies of DTSS and BASIC on GE computers in Phoenix. In early 1965, GE began to advertise timesharing services on its GE-265 system (GE 235 + DATANET 30), including BASIC and Dartmouth Algol, later renaming it the GE Mark I time-sharing system. Over the next few years, GE opened 25 computer centers in the United States and elsewhere, serving over fifty thousand users.

The Computer History Museum&#x27;s Corporate Histories Collection describes GE&#x27;s Mark I history this way:
:The precursor of General Electric Information Services began as a business unit within General Electric formed to sell excess computer time on the computers used to give customer demos. In 1965, Warner Sinback recommended that they begin to sell time-sharing services using the time-sharing system (Mark 1) developed at Dartmouth on a General Electric 265 computer. The service was an instant success and by 1968, GEIS had 40% of the $ 70 million time-sharing market. The service continued to grow, and over time migrated to the GE developed Mark II and Mark III operating systems running on large mainframe computers.

==Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, version 2==

From 1966 to 1968, DTSS was reimplemented on the GE 635, still using the DATANET-30 for terminal control. The GE 635 system was delivered in November 1966. By October 1967, it was providing a service based on Phase I software, jointly developed by Dartmouth and GE, which GE subsequently marketed as the GE Mark II system. In parallel with this work, Dartmouth embarked in 1967 on the development of Phase II under the direction of Professor John Kemeny, with programming carried out by students and faculty. Phase II of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System replaced Phase I on April 1, 1969, at Dartmouth.

As described in 1969, the new DTSS architecture was influenced by three criteria:

* The experiences with the 265 system.
* The published concepts of the Multics system.
* A realization of the limitations of the capabilities of a part-time staff of Dartmouth students and faculty members.

This new version was completely different internally from the earlier DTSS, but provided a near-identical user interface to enable a smooth transition for users and course materials. The 635 version provided interactive time-sharing to up to nearly 300 simultaneous users in the 1970s, a very large number at the time, and operated at eleven commercial and academic sites in the US, Canada and Europe. As it evolved in the 1970s, later versions moved to Honeywell 6000 series mainframes (1973) and Honeywell 716 communication processors (1974). In 1976 the GE-635 system was replaced by a Honeywell 66/40A computer. It remained in operation until the end of 1999.

DTSS, version 2, included a novel form of inter-process communication called &quot;communication files&quot;. They significantly antedated Unix pipes, as design documents put their conceptual origin sometime in 1967, and were described briefly in a 1969 conference:
:A communications file allows two jobs to interact directly without the use of secondary storage. A communications file has one end in each of two jobs. It is the software analog of a channel-to-channel adaptor. This structure allows job-to-job interactions using the same procedures as for more conventional files. The two ends are labeled master end and slave end. A job at the slave end of a communications file cannot easily distinguish this file from a conventional file. Since a job at the master end of a communications file can control and monitor all data transmitted on that file, a master end job can simulate a data file, thereby providing a useful debugging aid and also providing a convenient mechanism for interfacing running jobs to unexpected data structures.
Communication files supported read, write and close operations, but also synchronous and asynchronous data transfer, random access, status inquiries, out-of-band signaling, error reporting, and access control, with the precise semantics of each operation determined by the master process. As Douglas McIlroy notes: &quot;In this, [communication files were] more akin to Plan 9&#x27;s 9P protocol than to familiar IO.&quot; A notable application of communication files was in support of multi-user conferences, which behaved somewhat like conference phone calls, and were implemented entirely as user-space application programs.

==The Kiewit Network==

As mentioned above, Hanover High School was connected to DTSS from the system&#x27;s beginning. Over the next decade, many other high schools and colleges were connected to DTSS via the Kiewit Network, named for Peter Kiewit, donor of funds for the Kiewit Computation Center that housed the DTSS computers and staff. These schools connected to DTSS via one or more teletypes, modems, and dial-up telephone lines. Dartmouth students had free, unlimited access to DTSS, but high-school students had quotas of 40 to 72 hours of terminal access each week, and college users paid for computer use. Dartmouth ran active programs to engage and train high school teachers in using computation within their courses.

By 1967, the following high schools had joined the Kiewit Network: Hanover High School, The Holderness School, Mascoma Valley Regional High School, Kimball Union Academy, Mount Hermon School, Phillips Andover Academy, Phillips Exeter Academy, St. Paul&#x27;s School, and Vermont Academy. This group expanded in the Dartmouth Secondary School Project, funded by the NSF during 1967–1968, which added the following New England high schools: Cape Elizabeth High School, Concord High School, Hartford High School (Vermont), Keene High School, Lebanon High School, Loomis School, Manchester Central High School, Rutland High School, St. Johnsbury Academy, South Portland High School, and Timberlane High School.

From 1968 to 1970, Dartmouth added a number of colleges to the Kiewit Network via its Regional College Consortium. They included: Bates College, Berkshire Community College, Bowdoin College, Colby Junior College, Middlebury College, Mount Holyoke College, New England College, Norwich University, the University of Vermont, and Vermont Technical College.

By 1971, the Kiewit Network connected 30 high schools and 20 colleges in New England, New York, and New Jersey. At that time, DTSS was supporting over 30,000 users, of which only 3,000 were at Dartmouth College. By 1973, the Kiewit Network had expanded to include schools in Illinois, Michigan, upstate New York, Ohio, and Montreal, Canada.

==Usage==
 57% of DTSS use was for courses and 16% for research. Kemeny and Kurtz intended for students in technical and nontechnical fields to use DTSS. They arranged for the second trimester of the freshman mathematics class to include a requirement for writing and debugging four Dartmouth BASIC programs. By 1968, more than 80% of Dartmouth students had experience in computer programming. 80 classes included &quot;official&quot; computer use, including those in engineering, classics, geography, sociology, and Spanish; that students in the Tuck School of Business and social sciences, not mathematics or engineering, were the heaviest users surprised Kemeny. By 1972 90% of students had computer experience; because faculty knew that students were familiar with DTSS, using it became a routine part of many courses. A 1975 survey found that 29% of faculty used the computer in courses and 73% of students were enrolled in them, 43% of faculty used it in research, and 45% of faculty had written a computer program. By that year university administration used 28% of timesharing resources to students&#x27; 20%, with the registrar and housing office among users.

27% of DTSS use was for casual use and entertainment, which the university stated &quot;is in no sense regarded as frivolous&quot;, as such was an enjoyable way for users to become familiar with and not fear the computer. The library of hundreds of programs included, Kemeny and Kurtz reported, &quot;many games&quot;. They were pleased by the widespread faculty use of DTSS, and that many students continued using the system after no longer being required to. Kemeny—by then the university president—wrote in a 1971 brochure describing the system that just as a student could enter Baker Memorial Library and borrow a book without asking permission or explaining his purpose, &quot;any student may walk into Kiewit Computation Center, sit down at a console, and use the time-sharing system. No one will ask if he is solving a serious research problem, doing his homework the easy way, playing a game of football, or writing a letter to his girlfriend&quot;. By 1972 the football simulation supported simultaneous head-to-head play as a multiplayer video game. Kiewit&#x27;s location near Dartmouth College Greek organizations made it popular for socializing; students often brought dates to the Computation Center, both to play games and to demonstrate their own programs.

By the 1967–68 school year, in addition to 2,600 Dartmouth users, 5,550 people at ten universities and 23 high schools accessed DTSS. Kemeny had a terminal at home, and as president installed one in his office. By the early 1970s the campus had more than 150 terminals in 25 buildings, including portable units for patients at the campus infirmary. About 2,000 users logged into DTSS each day; 80% of students and 70% of faculty used the system each year. The off-campus Dartmouth Educational Time-Sharing Network included users with 79 terminals at 30 high schools and 20 universities, including Middlebury College, Phillips Andover, Mount Holyoke College, Goddard College, the United States Merchant Marine Academy, the United States Naval Academy, Bates College, the Dartmouth Club of New York, and a Dartmouth affiliate in Jersey City, New Jersey, sharing DTSS with Dartmouth people. The system allowed email-type messages to be passed between users and real-time chat via a precursor to the Unix talk program.

While several languages were available on DTSS, 98% of programs were written in Dartmouth BASIC. Because BASIC did not change, the system remained compatible with older applications; Kemeny reported in 1974 that programs he had written in 1964 would still run. By 1980, supported languages and systems included:

* 7MAP – DTSS 716 Macro Assembly Program

<text>Walter Sydney Adams (December 20, 1876 – May 11, 1956) was an American astronomer. He is renowned for his pioneering work in spectroscopy.

==Life and work==
Adams was born in Antioch, Ottoman Empire, to Lucien Harper Adams and Nancy Dorrance Francis Adams, missionary parents, and was brought to the U.S. in 1885 He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1898, then continued his education in Chicago and in Germany. After returning to the U.S., he began a career in Astronomy that culminated when he became director of the Mount Wilson Observatory.

His primary interest was the study of stellar spectra. He worked on solar spectroscopy and co-discovered a relationship between the relative intensities of certain spectral lines and the absolute magnitude of a star. He was able to demonstrate that spectra could be used to determine whether a star was a giant or a dwarf. In 1915 he began a study of the companion of Sirius and found that despite a size only slightly larger than the Earth, the surface of the star was brighter per unit area than the Sun and it was about as massive. Such a star later came to be known as a white dwarf. In 1925, he reported a gravitational redshift caused by Sirius B; this was regarded as significant confirmation of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of General Relativity. It is now known that his reported measurements were incorrect. Along with Theodore Dunham, he discovered the strong presence of carbon dioxide in the infrared spectrum of Venus.

Adams died at the age of 79 in Pasadena, California.

<doc id="635224" wikidata="Q7757557" url="?curid=635224" title="The Pod">
<text>The Pod is the second studio album by American rock band Ween. It was released on September 20, 1991, by Shimmy-Disc.

==Production==
The album was recorded from January to October 1990, at the Pod on Van Sant Road in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania. Recording concluded one month prior to the release of their on November 16. The album was derived from two tapes titled the &quot;Bilboa&quot; tape and the &quot;Big Timmy Wasserman&quot; tape. Both tapes contain not only demo versions of songs on the album, but many outtakes not used on any album or tracks used on future albums. All of the songs have a muddy quality to them, due to being recorded on a Tascam four-track cassette recorder, and many of the vocals are manipulated in strange ways.

==Composition==
The album contains bizarre lyrical content, often attributed to the fact that Dean and Gene both came down with cases of mononucleosis during the recording of the album, as well as their alleged relationship with huffing Scotchgard. However, when their fans began huffing Scotchgard, it was refuted by Gene Ween and Dean Ween themselves as being &quot;the most slime-bag thing we could think of.&quot;

Robyn Hitchcock is credited with &quot;musical inspiration&quot; for the track &quot;Alone&quot;, which borrows elements from his song &quot;Bones in the Ground&quot;.

The track &quot;Pollo Asado&quot; is a comedic skit with a man ordering a taco over music. The song was inspired by Gene Ween&#x27;s time briefly working at a Mexican restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania. In 1995, Sugar Ray released a similar skit on their debut &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;, titled &quot;Drive By&quot;. It featured the band ordering a taco at a drive through, with a drumbeat playing in the background.

==Title and album cover==
The album takes its name from the band&#x27;s apartment where the album was recorded, which the band nicknamed &quot;The Pod&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover art is a takeoff of the 1975 &quot;The Best of Leonard Cohen&quot; cover; Ween simply positioned a photo of part-time bassist Mean Ween&#x27;s head (wearing a &quot;Scotchgard powered bong&quot;) over Cohen&#x27;s cover art, and altered the title text and other graphics. The copy of the Leonard Cohen record that Ween used had purportedly belonged to Deaner&#x27;s mother.

==Liner notes==
From the Shimmy-Disc CD:

:&quot;Recorded by Dean and Gene Ween on a Tascam four-track cassette recorder between January and October 1990. All songs recorded at the Pod, where we lived for a year and 10 months (with our cat Mandee). The Pod was scenically located on Van Sant Road in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania. Our apartment was a haven for flies because it sits in the middle of a horse farm. In the time this album was completed, we filled up 3,600 hours of tape, and inhaled 5 cans of Scotchgard. This album was then produced and mixed by Andrew Weiss (our pal) at the Zion House of Flesh, Hopewell, New Jersey. Straight to DAT Mang. Mean Ween played the bass on &quot;Alone&quot; and that&#x27;s him on the cover doin&#x27; up some Scotchguard powered bongs. We got evicted on October 1, 1991. But Dave Ayers says he&#x27;s gonna help us out. Cover and art designs by Logarithms.&quot;

==Promotion==
&quot;The Pod&quot; produced three music videos. &quot;Pollo Asado&quot;, &quot;Captain Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Pork Roll Egg and Cheese&quot; were included on a VHS music video compilation titled &quot;Shimmy-Disc Video Volume 3&quot;. &quot;Shimmy-Disc Video&quot; was a series of VHS tapes created by Shimmy Disc containing music videos from artists who were signed to the label. These tapes were never remastered or re-released, nor were the music videos.

Shimmy-Disc released a vinyl version of &quot;The Pod&quot; in 1991. It was also remastered and reissued by Elektra Records in 1995, after the relative success of Ween albums such as &quot;Pure Guava&quot; (1992) and &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; (1994).

==Reception==

In 1993, the album was named one of the 20 best albums of 1992 by &quot;Spin&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote: &quot;Less inflamed and inspired than the first album (blame, perhaps, the five cans of Scotchguard the band claims to have inhaled), &quot;The Pod&quot; lurches, howls, fuzzes and strums through sloppy creations that are mostly one hit short of a high.&quot; Aphex Twin named it one of his 10 favorite albums of all time (making it one of two Ween albums on the list, the other being &quot;Pure Guava&quot;). In a 1999 review of the album, &quot;The Stranger&quot; called it &quot;excellent&quot; and wrote that &quot;someday, classical music students will write dissertations on &quot;The Pod&quot;.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote that &quot;the electrified production on tracks like &#x27;Dr. Rock&#x27; and &#x27;Sketches of Winkle&#x27; is utterly unhinged, while the barking, aimless pace of &#x27;The Stallion&#x27; (either part, really) feels like the sweaty blatherings of the most poisonous of drunks.&quot;

<text>Alfred Fowler, CBE FRS (22 March 1868, in Yorkshire – 24 June 1940) was an English astronomer and spectroscopist. 

== Early life and career ==
He was born in Wilsden on the outskirts of Bradford, Yorkshire and educated at London&#x27;s Normal School of Science, which was later absorbed into Imperial College, London.

Fowler was appointed Instructor (later Assistant Professor) of Astrophysics at Imperial College and worked there until his death. He was an expert in spectroscopy, being one of the first to determine that the temperature of sunspots was cooler than that of surrounding regions.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1910, when his citation read

:&quot;&quot;Associate of the Royal College of Science. Assistant Professor of Physics (Astrophysics Department) Imperial College and Technology, South Kensington. Distinguished for his contributions to Astronomical Physics by spectroscopic observations of eclipses, solar prominences, and sunspots, and by experimental researches bearing on their interpretation. Associated in observations of total eclipses of the sun with Sir Norman Lockyer in 1893, 1896, 1898, 1900, and (with Prof Callendar) in 1905.&quot; &quot;

:&quot;He was awarded their Royal Medal in 1918 and delivered their Bakerian Lectures in 1914 and 1924.&quot;

Fowler was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1919 to 1921 and died in Ealing, London in 1940.
==Pickering–Fowler series==
In 1896, Edward Charles Pickering published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectra of the star Zeta Puppis, which he attributed to hydrogen. Fowler managed to reproduce these lines experimentally from a hydrogen-helium mixture in 1912, and agreed with Pickering&#x27;s interpretation that they were previously unknown features in the spectrum of hydrogen. These lines became known as the Pickering–Fowler series and turned out to be of great significance in understanding the nature of the atom. Niels Bohr included a theoretical examination of these lines in his &#x27;trilogy&#x27; on atomic structure and concluded that they had been wrongly attributed to hydrogen, arguing instead that they arose from ionised helium, He+. Fowler was initially skeptical but was ultimately convinced that Bohr was correct, and by 1915 &quot;spectroscopists had transferred [the Pickering–Fowler series] definitively [from hydrogen] to helium.&quot; Bohr&#x27;s theoretical work on the series had demonstrated the need for &quot;a re-examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories&quot; and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory.

<text>Wilfred Van Norman Lucas (January 30, 1871 – December 13, 1940) was a Canadian American stage actor who found success in film as an actor, director, and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Lucas was born in Norfolk County, Ontario on January 30, 1871, most likely in the township of Townsend where at the time his father served as a Wesleyan Methodist minister. He was the youngest of three sons to be raised by Daniel Lucas and the former E. Adeline Reynolds, in Townsend and later Montreal, Quebec. Lucas attended the High School of Montreal and McGill University before immigrating to the United States in the late 1880s. His early career there was that of a baritone singer performing at church functions and at small venues.

==Career==

Lucas eventually made a name for himself performing in light and grand opera in America and abroad. He made his Broadway debut on April 4, 1904, at the Savoy Theater playing in both the curtain raiser &quot;The Blue Grass Handicap&quot; and &quot;The Superstition of Sue&quot; in which he played Sue&#x27;s brother, Percy Flage. Following his 1906 role in the highly successful play &quot;The Chorus Lady&quot;, Lucas was recruited to the fledgling Biograph Studios by D. W. Griffith. At the time, the film business was still looked down upon by many members of the theatrical community. In her 1925 book titled &quot;When the Movies Were Young&quot;, Griffith&#x27;s wife, actress Linda Arvidson, told the story of the early days at Biograph Studios. In it, she referred to Lucas as the &quot;first real grand actor, democratic enough to work in Biograph movies.&quot;

In 1908 Lucas made his motion picture debut in Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Greaser&#x27;s Gauntlet&quot;, appearing in more than 50 of these short (usually 17 minutes) films over the next two years. In 1910 while still acting, he wrote the script for Griffith&#x27;s film &quot;Sunshine Sue&quot;, which was followed by many more scripts by 1924. Lucas also began directing in 1912 with Griffith on &quot;An Outcast Among Outcasts&quot;, and directed another 44 films over the next 20 years. In early 1916 he starred as John Carter in &quot;Acquitted&quot;, about which &quot;Photoplay&quot; wrote, &quot;No single performance in the records of active photography has surpassed his visualization of the humble book-keeper in &quot;Acquitted&quot;.

Later in 1916 he appeared in D.W. Griffith&#x27;s film &quot;Intolerance&quot;.

Part of the group of Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood, Lucas became friends and sometimes starred with Mary Pickford, Sam De Grasse, and Marie Dressler. Canadian-born director Mack Sennett hired him to both direct and act in a large number of films at his Keystone Studios.

Wilfred Lucas made the successful transition from silent film to sound. While working in Hollywood, in 1926 he returned to the stage, performing in several Broadway plays. He later appeared as a foil for Laurel and Hardy in their feature films &quot;Pardon Us&quot; and &quot;A Chump at Oxford&quot;. During his long career, Wilfred Lucas appeared in more than 375 films. Although for a time he was cast in leading roles, he became very successful as secondary and minor characters, making a good living in the film industry for more than three decades.

==Personal life==
On October 10, 1898, Lucas, by then a member of a stock company headed by actor James Durkin, wed fellow cast member Louise Perine at Elmira, New York. The couple went on to have two sons, Wilfred &quot;Irving&quot; Lucas, Kirke LaShelle Lucas, and one daughter, Alice Van Norman Lucas, before their divorce sometime before 1910. Five years after he married Louise, Lucas became an American citizen at a ceremony held in San Bernardino, California.

While working at Biograph Studios, Wilfred Lucas met and ultimately married actress/screenwriter Bess Meredyth (1890–1969) with whom he had a son. John Meredyth Lucas (1919–2002) became a successful writer and director including a number of episodes of &quot;Mannix&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. John Lucas wrote about his sometimes strained relationship with his father after his parents divorced in his book &quot;Eighty Odd Years in Hollywood: Memoir of a Career in Film and Television&quot; (2004)

==Death==
Wilfred Lucas died on December 13, 1940, at Los Angeles and was interred at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory

In 2023, Lucas&#x27; cremains were removed from non-public vaultage in the basement of the crematory to a publicly accessible niche in the chapel columbarium.

<text>An edge city is a concentration of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a traditional downtown or central business district, in what had previously been a suburban, residential or rural area. The term was popularized by the 1991 book &quot;Edge City: Life on the New Frontier&quot; by Joel Garreau, who established its current meaning while working as a reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Garreau argues that the edge city has become the standard form of urban growth worldwide, representing a 20th-century urban form unlike that of the 19th-century central downtown. Other terms for these areas include &quot;suburban activity centers&quot;, &quot;megacenters&quot;, and &quot;suburban business districts&quot;. These districts have now developed in many countries.

==Definitions==
In 1991, Garreau established five rules for a place to be considered an edge city:
* Has five million or more square feet (465,000 m2) of leasable office space
* Has 600,000 square feet (56,000 m2) or more of leasable retail space
* Has more jobs than bedrooms
* Is perceived by the population as one place
* Was nothing like a &quot;city&quot; as recently as 30 years ago. Then it was just bedrooms, if not cow pastures.

Most edge cities develop at or near existing or planned freeway intersections, and are especially likely to develop near major airports. They rarely include heavy industry. They often are not separate legal entities but are governed as part of surrounding counties (this is more often the case in the East than in the Midwest, South, or West). They are numerous—almost 200 in the United States, compared to 45 downtowns of comparable size—and are large geographically because they are built at automobile scale.

===Types of edge cities===
Garreau identified three distinct varieties of the edge city phenomenon:
* Boomburbs or &quot;boomers&quot; – the most common type, having developed incrementally but rapidly around a shopping mall or highway interchange, for example Tysons, Virginia, near Washington, D.C.
* Greenfields – originally master-planned as new towns, generally on the suburban fringe, for example Reston Town Center in Reston, Virginia, near Washington, D.C.
* Uptowns – an older city, town, or satellite city, upon and around which a major regional hub of economic activity rises, for example Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.

Additional terms are used to refer to edge cities, such as &quot;suburban business districts&quot;, &quot;major diversified centers&quot;, &quot;suburban cores&quot;, &quot;minicities&quot;, &quot;suburban activity centers&quot;, &quot;cities of realms&quot;, &quot;galactic cities&quot;, &quot;urban subcenters&quot;, &quot;pepperoni-pizza cities&quot;, &quot;superburbia&quot;, &quot;technoburbs&quot;, &quot;nucleations&quot;, &quot;disurbs&quot;, &quot;service cities&quot;, &quot;perimeter cities&quot;, &quot;peripheral centers&quot;, &quot;urban villages&quot;, and &quot;suburban downtowns&quot;.

==Density and cityscapes==
Spatially, edge cities primarily consist of mid-rise office towers (with some skyscrapers) surrounded by massive surface parking lots and meticulously manicured lawns, almost reminiscent of the designs of Le Corbusier. Instead of a traditional street grid, their street networks are hierarchical, consisting of winding parkways (often lacking sidewalks) that feed into arterial roads or freeway ramps. However, edge cities feature job density similar to that of secondary downtowns found in places such as Newark and Pasadena; indeed, Garreau writes that edge cities&#x27; development proves that &quot;density is back!&quot;.

==History==

Garreau shows how edge cities developed in a U.S. context. Starting in the 1950s, businesses were incentivized to open branches in the suburbs and eventually in many cases, leave traditional downtowns entirely, due to increased use of the automobile and move of middle and upper class residents to suburbs, which in turn led to frustration with downtown traffic and lack of parking. Escalating land values in central downtown areas, and the development of communications (telephone, fax, email and other electronic communication) also enabled the trend.

Despite early examples in the 1920s, it was not until car ownership surged in the 1950s, after four decades of fast, steady growth, that it was possible for edge cities to emerge on a large scale. Whereas virtually every American central business district (CBD) or secondary downtown that developed around non-motorized transportation or the streetcar has a pedestrian-friendly grid pattern of relatively narrow streets, most edge cities instead have a hierarchical street arrangement centered on pedestrian-hostile arterial roads, making most of this generation of edge cities difficult to get to and get around with public transportation or by walking, although transit was sometimes added in later decades, such as the Silver Line metro linking Downtown Washington, D.C., with Arlington and Tysons edge cities, and government-planned edge cities in London (Canary Wharf) and Paris (La Défense) integrated transit from the start.

The first edge city was Detroit&#x27;s New Center, developed in the 1920s, three miles (5 km) north of downtown, as a new downtown for Detroit. New Center and the Miracle Mile section of Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles are considered the earliest automobile-oriented urban forms. However the two were built with radically different purposes in mind (New Center as an office park, the Miracle Mile as a retail strip). Garreau&#x27;s classic example of an edge city is the information technology center Tysons, Virginia, west of Washington, D.C.

===Outside the U.S.===
Garreau shows how edge cities have also developed in other countries, specifically citing Canada, Mexico, Australia, and cities such as Paris, London, Karachi, Jakarta, and Tianjin, China. In the cases of London and Paris he notes how these edge cities developed with government planning and with integrated public transportation.

==Problems ==
===Mobility===
Edge cities planned around freeway interchanges have a history of severe traffic problems if one of these freeways goes unbuilt. In particular, Century City, a pioneering 1960s edge city built on a former 20th Century Fox backlot in western Los Angeles, was built with long-term plans for access via an urban rail system and the planned Beverly Hills Freeway. Neither project ever came to fruition, resulting in massive congestion on the surface streets connecting Century City to existing freeways, every two miles (3 km) distant. More than a half-century later, the D Line subway extension will finally provide rail access, with Century City/Constellation station planned to open in 2025.

===Sustainability===
As recently as 2003, some critics believed that edge cities might turn out to have been only a 20th-century phenomenon because of their limitations. The residents of the low-density housing areas around them tend to be fiercely resistant to their outward expansion (as has been the case in Tysons and Century City), but because their internal road networks are severely limited in capacity, densification is more difficult than in the traditional grid network that characterizes traditional CBDs and secondary downtowns. As a result, construction of medium- and high-density housing in edge cities ranges was perceived to be &quot;difficult to impossible&quot;. Because most are built at automobile scale, it was felt that &quot;mass transit frequently could not serve them well&quot;. Pedestrian access to and circulation within an edge city was perceived to be impractical if not impossible, even if residences are nearby. Revitalization of edge cities was seen to be &quot;the major urban renewal project of the 21st century&quot;.

==In the 21st century==
===Densification===
Today, many edge cities have plans for densification, sometimes around a walkable downtown-style core, often with a push for more accessibility by transit and bicycle, and addition of housing in denser, urban-style neighborhoods within the edge city. For example, at Tysons, in the Washington, D.C., metro area, the plan remains to see the city become the downtown core of Fairfax County. To this point &quot;…eight districts have been delimited, with four centered on new metro stations being transit-oriented development districts&quot;. Future plans to transportation around the area continue to be made, the accessibility of the area is on the rise with many forms of transportation being formed. &quot;The aims of the plan are for 75% of development to be within half a mile of metro stations, an urban center of 200,000 jobs and 100,000 residents, a jobs balance of 4.0 per household&quot;.

===Outside North America===
Despite the lessons of the American experience, in rapidly developing countries such as China and India and the United Arab Emirates, the edge city is quickly emerging as an important new development form as automobile ownership skyrockets and marginal land is bulldozed for development. For example, the outskirts of Bangalore, India are increasingly replete with mid-rise mirrored-glass office towers set amid lush gardens and sprawling parking lots where many foreign companies have set up shop. Dubai offers another example.

==Impact ==
===Relation with metropolitan area===
The emergence of edge cities has not been without consequences to the metropolitan areas they surround. Edge cities arise from population decentralization from large major core cities and has been ongoing since the 1960s. Shifts in socioeconomics in metro areas (including rising real estate prices during periods of stagnant wages), location of metro industrial areas, and labor competition between edge cities and their more central neighbors have been attributed to their development and continued expansion. There has been a considerable debate among economists as to whether &quot;jobs follow people or people follow jobs,&quot; but in the context of the edge city phenomenon, workers have been drawn from metropolitan business hubs in favor of the edge city economy. Developers of edge cities have been shown to strategically plan expansion of such business areas to draw workers away from more dense port cities and thereby keep profits from surrounding interests.

Edge cities contribute greatly to urban development by creating new jobs by attracting workers from the metropolitan areas around it. Also as a result of the rise of edge cities, more department stores, hotels, apartments, and office spaces are created. There are more edge cities than their downtown counterparts of the same size. Garreau states one reason for the rise of edge cities is that, &quot;Today, we have moved our means of creating wealth, the essence of urbanism - our jobs - out to where most of us have lived and shopped for two generations. That has led to the rise of Edge City.&quot; In comparison with urban centers edge cities offer global corporations many advantages: cheaper land, security, efficient land communications, advanced technological installations, and a high quality of life for their employees and executives. The appeal of edge cities attract large corporations as well, boosting the already growing city.

===Impact on economy and industries===
This concept has showcased the impact that national economies have on the edge city and the surrounding areas. Through Garreau, the term edge city has provided information on how corporate players remain important to the strength of urban and regional subsets. Garreau describes that the edge city has a tendency to have a large service-oriented industry linked to the national economy. The edge city offers supplies to the local area in the form of retail facilities and consumer services. Progressively different services begin to move towards the edge city as the population of corporate businesses increase. The corporate offices fill in space in edge cities and provide connections to exterior locations if decisions are being made from those locales. Not only do corporate, service, and transportation based edge cities exist, but the innovation-driven edge cities will generate extra-metropolitan linkages. These innovative edge cities expand various corporate activities as hosts. Edge cities may create a significant growth in sophisticated retail, entertainment, and consumer service facilities, which in turn leads to a rise in local employment opportunities. The edge city has a tendency to affect the surrounding areas by procuring more opportunities within the labor market. Edge Cities are well suited to an economy which is known for a service-oriented market as well as sustaining major manufacturing sectors.

===Political relations===
Political groups aid the creation of the edge city in a particular way. There is usually a development commission or similar organization that operates in parallel to, and interact with standard city, county, and state government institutions. Some authors call such commissions private &quot;proto-government&quot; or &quot;shadow governments&quot;. According to authors Phelps and Dear, these &quot;shadow governments can tax, legislate for, and police their communities, but they are rarely accountable, are responsive primarily to wealth (as opposed to numbers of voters), and subject to few constitutional constraints”, as &quot;edge cities have had substantial investments placed in them&quot;. In most cases a ‘privatopia’ is formed within edge city residential areas, where the private housing developments are administered by homeowner associations. In 1964 there were fewer than 500 associations, but “…by 1992, there were 150,000 associations privately governing approximately 32 million Americans”.

As with any city, edge cities go through phases of growth and redevelopment. Politics within Edge Cities are unique in that they typically revolve around developing them. They contribute to a &quot;growth machine&quot; that spreads the urbanization of the United States. They can obscure smaller settlements that are also going through similar phases of redevelopment. Depending on the size of the settlements the modes of urban politics can change. &quot;State interventions are important both conceptually and to the empirical matter of this article since the extent, timing, nature, and legacies of state interventions significantly shape the mode of urban politics in different places and in a single place over time&quot;. State interventions are essential to the politics in developing edge cities. Tysons, Virginia is an example that went through the process of development due to the county government&#x27;s aggressive recruitment of businesses. Similar methods of development can be seen and applied to other edge cities as well. Tysons recruited businesses with the promise of growth in the future. More businesses coming in allowed for the city to grow which led to the businesses growing as well. A chain reaction was created which crafted the modern-day Tysons. This community was also an example of politics playing a role in developing an edge city. It could be traced to a special commission established at the request of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors that examined the fiscal capacity of the County vis-à-vis perceived shortfalls in collective consumption expenditures (County of Fairfax 1976a).

<text>Harold Delos Babcock (January 24, 1882 – April 8, 1968) was an American astronomer and the father of Horace W. Babcock. He was of English and German ancestry. He was born in Edgerton, Wisconsin, before completing high school in Los Angeles and was accepted to the University of California, Berkeley in 1901. He worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory from 1907 until 1948. He specialized in solar spectroscopy and precisely mapped the distribution of magnetic fields over the Sun&#x27;s surface, working alongside his son. In 1953 he won the Bruce Medal. Babcock died of a heart attack in Pasadena, California at age 86.

The crater Babcock on the Moon is named after him, as is asteroid 3167 Babcock (jointly named after him and his son).

<doc id="635236" wikidata="Q3402580" url="?curid=635236" title="Fairbourne">
<text>Fairbourne is a seaside village in Gwynedd, Wales. Located on the coast of Barmouth Bay in Arthog community, to the south of the estuary of the River Mawddach, it is surrounded by Snowdonia National Park. It is in an area that had been listed by Gwynedd Council for managed retreat due to rising sea levels.

== History ==
Fairbourne is part of the historic county of Meirionnydd. The area was originally salt marshes and slightly higher grazing lands. Before development began in the mid-19th century, there were three farms on the land. The coastal area was originally known as Morfa Henddol, while the promontory outcrop now occupied by the Fairbourne Hotel was called Ynysfaig.

Circa 1865, Solomon Andrews, a Welsh entrepreneur, purchased the promontory. Over the next few years, he built a seawall for tidal protection and several houses. To facilitate this, he built a gauge horse-drawn tramway from the main railway to the site in order to bring in building materials. In 1916, the tramway was converted to a gauge steam railway. The wealthy flour-maker Sir Arthur McDougall had been looking for a country estate but when he discovered this area, he soon conceived of it as a seaside resort. In July 1895, Arthur McDougall purchased a substantial acreage from land speculators, which he enlarged by additional lots the following year. He then immediately hired a builder to begin the development of a model seaside resort.

Unusually for Gwynedd county, the village has no official Welsh-language name. Unlike most of Gwynedd, where Welsh is the majority language, English is the predominant language in Fairbourne with most of its inhabitants coming from or descended from those who came from England.

== Sea level rise management ==
Fairbourne had been identified as unsustainable to defend, given predicted sea level rise. The best estimate was that the area would be abandoned between 2052 and 2062. This was based on a rise in critical sea level of . However, based on current rates of sea level rise it would take 100 to 200 years from 2014 to reach 0.5 metres. There was an intent to maintain defences of the village for a period of only 40 years from 2014. This policy of managed retreat was strongly opposed by local residents.

In November 2021, government officials declared that by 2052, it would no longer be safe/sustainable to live in the village. This has been disputed by a number of research reports.
In 2021 a survey was carried out by Arthog Community Council to obtain the views of Fairbourne residents to the proposed plans for the village. There was a feeling by residents that their concerns were being ignored, and that Fairbourne was being selected for decommissioning without adequate justification. &quot;Having attended the multi-agency meeting in the village hall, residents are &#x27;stone walled&#x27;, not listened to, and told what to do without our views being considered.&quot; &quot;It has been stressed at public meetings and acknowledged by Natural Resources Wales that local knowledge is important. Is Gwynedd Council just relying on consultants with computers?&quot;

In March 2022, the issue of Fairbourne was raised in the Welsh Senedd by Mabon ap Gwynfor AS: &quot;The west of Wales shoreline management plan is based on work done 10 years ago. Now, since then, of course, a great deal of work has been done on coastal flood defences, which changes the forecast for communities such as Fairbourne, but the plans haven&#x27;t changed to reflect this work... There is room to doubt the modelling of Natural Resources Wales, which is based on inadequate data and old software.&quot;

In May 2022, Arthog Community Council approved a motion to reject the plans by Gwynedd Council to decommission Fairbourne village, citing various failings in the decision-making process.

In November 2022, Huw Williams of Gwynedd Council stated: &quot;The Fairbourne Moving Forward Project Board has been aware of the negative impact on the community as a consequence of the mention of &#x27;decommissioning&#x27; Fairbourne in &#x27;2054&#x27; by the press and other stakeholders&quot;...&quot;There are no current plans to decommission the village&quot;. An email to Arthog Community Council from Mr Williams from July 2022 also contains the line: &quot;No public body – let alone Gwynedd Council – is intending to destroy Fairbourne.&quot;

In May 2023, Welsh Government Climate Change minister Julie James was asked about the future of the village. She was adamant that the village had not been written off. She said: &quot;We have made no decision on the future of Fairbourne, I want to make that clear.&quot;

Arnall and Hilson (2023) investigated the political conflict which had developed between residents of Fairbourne and Gwynedd Council. They concluded: &quot;The paper highlights the need for improved dialogue...This is potentially one way to minimise the present-day harms resulting from the projected effects of sea level rise and to imagine more open-ended, hopeful futures for affected coastal communities.&quot;

In a constituency report of December 2024, Mabon ap Gwynfor stated that he had again raised the issue of Fairbourne in the Welsh Senedd: 
“I asked for a Statement on the long term prospects of Fairbourne. Local people are unable to get mortgages and insurance because of fears about coastal flooding. Sea defences have been improved and Fairbourne is now safe. This message needs to get out and I urged the Minister to make a statement.” 

== Attractions ==
=== Beach ===
The beach is a two-mile stretch of sand, backed by a steep storm beach of pebbles which is as high as the sea defences in some places. At the northern end the beach joins the Mawddach Estuary, while at the southern end of the beach is squeezed between sheer cliffs and the sea. The beach is a venue for people exercising their dogs, however, during the summer months there is a dog ban enforced on the central area. There is access to the beach for those visitors with prams and/or wheelchairs. The beach is fronted by tank traps known as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Teeth&quot; dating from the Second World War. The beach regularly meets the European Blue Flag criteria.

=== Railway and Ferry ===
The Fairbourne Railway has provided a link from the village to Penrhyn Point for over a century. It runs regular passenger services between April and October.

The Barmouth Ferry sails from the seaward end of the Fairbourne Railway to Barmouth/Abermaw.

== Transport ==
Fairbourne railway station is served by the Cambrian Coast Railway, which runs from Machynlleth to Pwllheli and is operated by Transport for Wales.

Lloyds Coaches also operate a regular bus service to Dolgellau and Tywyn.

<doc id="635238" wikidata="Q2806624" url="?curid=635238" title="1000 Homo DJs">
<text>1000 Homo DJs was a side project of American industrial rock band Ministry. The project released two singles, one of which featured a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Supernaut&quot;.

1000 Homo DJs began as a side project to release outtakes from Ministry&#x27;s &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;. The credits read &quot;Another Luxa/Pan Production&quot;, which was the production pseudonym for Ministry members Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker.

==Origin of name==
In a 2004 interview, Jourgensen explained that when he played demos (presumably those which became &quot;Apathy&quot;) for Wax Trax! co-owner Jim Nash, the latter replied, &quot;No one&#x27;s gonna buy this. It&#x27;ll take one thousand homo DJs to play this for one person to buy it.&quot;

However, according to the Wax Trax! box set &quot;Black Box&quot; released in 1994, Jourgensen and Nash were in the label&#x27;s office listening to an unauthorized remix of the Revolting Cocks&#x27; (Jourgensen&#x27;s other project) single &quot;We Shall Cleanse the World&quot;. Nash comforted Jourgensen, who disapproved of the remix&#x27;s existence, by assuring him that it would only ever be heard by &quot;a thousand homo DJs&quot;.

==Members==
The members of 1000 Homo DJs were identified by pseudonyms in the CD liner notes. However, most of their identities are fairly certain.

*Buck Satan: Al Jourgensen
*Officer Agro: speculated to be Jeff Ward, but possibly Paul Barker or Martin Atkins
*Ike Krull: Mike Scaccia
*The Temple of Drool Choir: Mike O&#x27;Connell, Wes Kidd, Brian St. Clair, Herb Rosen, Joe Kelly, David &quot;Slash&quot; Weidman, Jerry Rodgers
*Wee Willie Reefer: William Rieflin
*Viva Nova: also known as Mel&#x27;Amour and P.A.M., and later known as Vivanovachicago, but often misidentified as Patty Jourgensen
*Count Ringworm: Jello Biafra

===Trent Reznor&#x27;s involvement===
The nature of Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor&#x27;s contribution to 1000 Homo DJs&#x27; records has been debated. What is certain is that Reznor recorded the original vocals for &quot;Supernaut&quot;. This performance was not officially used because Reznor&#x27;s label, TVT Records, refused to allow his appearance on the release. Reznor&#x27;s version would ultimately be released as &quot;Supernaut (Trent Reznor Vocal Version)&quot; by TVT four years later on the retrospective &quot;Black Box - Wax Trax! Records: The First 13 Years&quot;, following TVT&#x27;s purchase of Wax Trax!.

Jourgensen&#x27;s immediate response to TVT&#x27;s ultimatum is uncertain. An oft-repeated story tells that instead of recording new vocals, Jourgensen merely ran Reznor&#x27;s performance through a distortion effect to mask its identity. According to this story, every WaxTrax! recording of &quot;Supernaut&quot; contains Reznor&#x27;s vocals. However, a dissenting group claims this is an urban legend, and that Jourgensen did record new vocals for the EP—albeit in a similar style to Reznor&#x27;s initial performance. Statements made by both Reznor and Jourgensen seem to confirm the latter view. In a 1992 Prodigy post regarding &quot;Supernaut&quot;, Reznor said, [I] finally told Al to redo it without me. The version that Wax Trax put out is Al, the version on the NIN single is me. Reznor referred to the two-track &quot;Suck&quot; bootleg, which contained the recording of &quot;Supernaut&quot; that later appeared on &quot;Black Box&quot;. Jourgensen made a similar statement in a 2003 interview. When asked whose vocals appear on &quot;Supernaut&quot;, Jourgensen replied, referring to the WaxTrax! EP, &quot;Black Box&quot;, and &quot;Greatest Fits&quot; versions, respectively (and corroborating that only the &quot;Trent Reznor Vocal Version&quot; contained Reznor&#x27;s performance, and that Jourgensen in fact sang on most versions of the song): That would be me on the original, on WaxTrax! The later version released on TVT was Trent Reznor... then the remixed version had my vocals on it.

<text>Horace Welcome Babcock (September 13, 1912 – August 29, 2003) was an American astronomer. He was the son of Harold D. Babcock.

==Career==
Babcock invented and built a number of astronomical instruments, and in 1953 was the first to propose the idea of adaptive optics. He specialized in spectroscopy and the study of magnetic fields of stars. He proposed the Babcock Model, a theory for the magnetism of sunspots.

During World War II, he was engaged in radiation work at MIT and Caltech. After the war he began a productive collaboration with his father. His undergraduate studies were at Caltech and his doctorate from University of California, Berkeley.

Babcock&#x27;s 1938 doctoral thesis contained one of the earliest indications of dark matter. He reported measurements of the rotation curve for the Andromeda galaxy (M31) which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially. He, however, attributed it to either absorption of light within the galaxy or modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter. It was not until the 1970s and the work of Rubin and Ford that Babcock&#x27;s rotation curve of M31 was fully accepted as an indication of a mass or gravity problem in spiral galaxies.

He was director of the Palomar Observatory for Caltech from 1964 to 1978.

<text>Cardigan Bay () is a large inlet of the Irish Sea, indenting the west coast of Wales between Bardsey Island, Gwynedd in the north, and Strumble Head, Pembrokeshire at its southern end. It is the largest bay in Wales.

==Geography==
Cardigan Bay has numerous beaches, and marine life. Much of the coast surrounding the bay is fertile farmland, dotted with towns and seaside resorts such as Fishguard, New Quay, Aberaeron, Llanon, Aberystwyth, Borth, Aberdyfi, Tywyn, Barmouth, Porthmadog, Criccieth and Pwllheli on the Cambrian Coast. Smaller coastal villages include Cwmtydu, Nanternis and Llangrannog.

Major rivers flowing into the bay include the Glaslyn, Mawddach, Dysynni, Dyfi, Rheidol, Ystwyth, Aeron and Teifi.

==History==
Until the early 20th century, Cardigan Bay supported a strong maritime industry. Cardigan is located at the mouth of the River Teifi; hence the Welsh name, Aberteifi (&quot;Mouth of the Teifi&quot;). At the turn of the 19th century, the heyday of the port, it was a more important port than Cardiff. At this time more than 300 ships were registered at Cardigan—seven times as many as Cardiff, and three times as many as Swansea.

The central and northern areas of the bay are the location of the legendary Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod, the drowned &quot;Lowland Hundred&quot; or &quot;Hundred under the Sea&quot;. During the winter storms of 2014, parts of the lost ancient forest of Borth, which 4,500 years ago stretched on the boggy land to Ynyslas, reappeared on the shoreline in the form of preserved exposed tree stumps. Due to climate change and rising sea levels, the forest was buried under layers of peat, sand and saltwater.

==Nature and tourism==
The Cardigan Bay Special Area of Conservation was set up to preserve the natural wildlife in the area, both in the sea and on the surrounding foreshore.

From the Ceredigion Coast Path it is often possible to observe the Bay&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; species of harbour porpoise, grey seals, and bottlenose dolphins, of which the bay has the largest population in the UK. Other mammals, such as minke whales, Risso&#x27;s dolphins and common dolphins, together with many species of seabirds, such as puffin, and sharks, including basking sharks, can also be seen.

Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, the bay has been invaded by spider crabs. Not a seafood normally consumed by British people, since 2010 the local fishermen have supplied the Michelin-starred restaurants of Raymond Blanc.

==Military testing==
A military testing range was first established in Cardigan Bay during the Second World War. The range is controlled from a main operating base located near Aberporth, known as MoD Aberporth. Historically, the range has played a significant part in the development and testing of a variety of military weapons.

Today the Ministry of Defence (MOD) range within Cardigan Bay provides a large secure safety area for the testing of air launched weapons and unmanned aerial systems. The range is a significant employer in the West Wales area, employing some 200 people who work in direct support of the range operation.

The Range Danger Area covers some of Cardigan Bay from sea level to unlimited height. To supplement the safe operation of the range, there are a number of small outposts located on the edge of Cardigan Bay and the Llŷn Peninsula. These outposts contain equipment that enables the range to effectively assess the performance of weapons.

Qinetiq operates the Cardigan Bay/Aberporth Range on behalf of the MOD under the terms of a Long Term Partnering Agreement. The purpose of the agreement is to deliver defence test, evaluation and training support services to ensure air launched weapon systems, associated sub-systems and UAS are safe and fit for purpose.

<doc id="635247" wikidata="Q229234" url="?curid=635247" title="Ellen Barkin">
<text>Ellen Rona Barkin (born April 16, 1954) is an American actress. Her breakthrough role was in the 1982 film &quot;Diner&quot;, and in the following years, she had starring roles in films such as &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; (1983), &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers&quot; (1983), &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot; (1984), &quot;The Big Easy&quot; (1986), &quot;Johnny Handsome&quot;, and &quot;Sea of Love&quot; (both 1989).

In 1991, for her leading role in the film &quot;Switch&quot;, Barkin received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Her subsequent film credits include: &quot;Man Trouble&quot;, &quot;Into the West&quot; (both 1992), &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; (1993), &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Wild Bill&quot; (both 1995), &quot;The Fan&quot; (1996), &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998), &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; (1999), &quot;Crime and Punishment in Suburbia&quot; (2000), &quot;Palindromes&quot; (2004), &quot;Trust the Man&quot; (2005), &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007), &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Cobbler&quot; (2014).
In 1998, Barkin received a Primetime Emmy Award for her performance in the television film &quot;Before Women Had Wings&quot;. In 2011, she received the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her Broadway theatre debut in &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;. From 2016 until 2019, she played the leading role of Janine &quot;Smurf&quot; Cody on the TNT drama series &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;. From 2012 until 2013, she played the leading role of Jane Forrest on the NBC sitcom &quot;The New Normal&quot;. 

Her producing credits include the films &quot;Letters to Juliet&quot;, &quot;Shit Year&quot; (both 2010), and &quot;Another Happy Day&quot; (2011).

==Early life==
Barkin was born on April 16, 1954, in the Bronx, New York, the daughter of Evelyn (née Rozin), a hospital administrator who worked at Jamaica Hospital, and Sol Barkin, a chemical salesman. Her family is Jewish; they emigrated from Siberia and the Ukrainian–Polish border.

Barkin lived in Flushing, New York, and attended Parsons Junior High School. She received her high school diploma at Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts. She then attended Hunter College and double majored in history and drama. At one point, Barkin wanted to teach ancient history. She continued her acting education at New York City&#x27;s Actors Studio. According to &quot;Time&quot;, she studied acting for 10 years before landing her first audition.

==Career==

Her break-out role was in the comedy-drama film &quot;Diner&quot; (1982), written and directed by Barry Levinson, for which she received favorable reviews. Barkin was cast in the drama film &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; (1983) after impressing its director Bruce Beresford during an audition in New York City, despite her inexperience and his lack of familiarity with her work. Robert Duvall, who played the lead role in &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;, said of Barkin, &quot;She brings a real credibility to that part, plus she was young and attractive and had a certain sense of edge, a danger to her that was good for that part.&quot; She also appeared in the 1983 rock and roll drama film &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers&quot;.

Barkin later appeared in several successful films, including the thrillers &quot;The Big Easy&quot; (1987), opposite Dennis Quaid and &quot;Sea of Love&quot; (1989), opposite Al Pacino. Barkin also appeared in off-Broadway plays, including a role as one of the roommates in &quot;Extremities&quot;, about an intended rape victim played by Susan Sarandon who turns the tables on her attacker. About her performance in the play &quot;Eden Court&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Frank Rich summarized: &quot;If it were really possible to give the kiss of life to a corpse, the actress Ellen Barkin would be the one to do it. In &quot;Eden Court&quot;, the moribund play that has brought her to the Promenade Theater, Miss Barkin is tantalizingly alive from her bouncing blond ponytail to the long legs that gyrate wildly and involuntarily every time an Elvis Presley record plays on stage&quot;.

Barkin has also done work in made-for-television films such as &quot;Before Women Had Wings&quot; (1997), for which she won an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie and &quot;The White River Kid&quot; (1999). She voiced the start of each &quot;Theme Time Radio Hour &quot;with host Bob Dylan on XM&#x27;s &quot;Deep Tracks&quot;. In 2005, Barkin set up a film production company with her brother, George, along with her husband at the time and billionaire investor, Ronald Perelman.

Barkin appeared in her Broadway debut as Dr. Brookner in &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, for which she won the 2011 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Barkin has received acclaim for her performance in &quot;Another Happy Day&quot;. IndieWire cited her turn as one of the best female performances of the year. In 2015, she starred as Dani Kirschenbloom, in the Showtime comedy-drama series &quot;Happyish&quot;.

From 2016 through 2019, Barkin starred as Janine &quot;Smurf&quot; Cody, the crime family&#x27;s matriarch, in the TNT drama series &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;. The series is based on the 2010 Australian film where Smurf was played by Jacki Weaver.

==Personal life==

Barkin is the mother of two children, Jack Daniel (born 1989) and Romy Marion (born 1992), from her marriage to actor Gabriel Byrne. She and Byrne separated in 1993 and divorced in 1999, but remain close. Byrne attended Barkin&#x27;s 2000 wedding to multibillionaire and businessman Ronald Perelman. Her second marriage ended in divorce in 2006. 

In 1998, Barkin had a relationship with actor Johnny Depp with whom she worked on &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. From 2008 to 2011, Barkin dated filmmaker Sam Levinson.

In October 2006, &quot;Magnificent Jewels from the Collection of Ellen Barkin&quot; were sold for $20,369,200 at Christie&#x27;s, New York.

Barkin has a brother, George, who was formerly the editor-in-chief of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; and &quot;High Times&quot;.

<doc id="635249" wikidata="Q5569630" url="?curid=635249" title="Glimmer man">
<text>A glimmer man (also rendered as &quot;glimmerman&quot;; ) was a somewhat pejorative name unofficially, but almost universally, applied to inspectors who were employed by the Alliance and Dublin Consumers&#x27; Gas Company, the Cork Gas Consumers Company and other supply companies in the smaller towns and places in Ireland to detect the use of gas in restricted periods during the years of the Emergency in Ireland from March 1942 and in some places as late as 1947. The term derived from the copy of advertisements published in the media and on posters which enjoined the population not to waste gas &quot;...not even a glimmer.&quot;

Ireland has negligible indigenous coal resources and production of coal gas was dependent on the importation of coal which was severely restricted as a result of the war in Europe. An extract from a letter states it was &quot;a drastic fuel famine.&quot;

==Restrictions==
Notwithstanding attempts by the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau to manufacture gas from bog peat, imports of suitable coal and therefore gas production fell dramatically and initially its use for home heating was prohibited. In March 1942 the supply in Dublin was cut to 10 hours per day during the week and 11 on Sundays but this only reduced usage by about a quarter. In May the supply was further reduced to 5.5 hours per day and the gas supply companies changed their terms of supply to make the use of gas in &quot;off hours&quot; a breach of contract. The off hours were popularly referred to as the &quot;glimmer hours.&quot;

==Deprivation==
The reductions in supply caused great privation as a large proportion of the population (particularly in the cities and towns) were dependent on gas for heat, cooking and lighting. As there were no readily available alternative sources of fuel, especially for cooking, people were reduced, if they could, to using the residual gas left in the pipes after the reticulated mains supply had been turned off at the gasworks. By 1943, the Dublin Gas Company were running advertisements describing the glimmer man as &quot;a public benefactor […] Don&#x27;t blame or hinder him in carrying out his duty.&quot;

Eventually the supply was so restricted that by April 1944 the Minister for Supplies, Seán Lemass was threatening to make a special Emergency Powers Order to officially ration the supply to dwellings and businesses to certain hours of the day and make it a criminal offence to use gas in the &quot;off hours&quot;. However that threat was apparently never carried out.

One of the effects of the restrictions was that the smaller supply companies closed or attempted to maintain supply using gas derived from peat and charcoal.

==Powers==
The gas companies&#x27; officials were empowered under their supply contract with their customers to enter premises to carry out their inspections and if they detected anyone using gas outside the permitted hours could disconnect the premises from the mains supply.

However, some Dublin residents, such as students at Trinity College Dublin were apparently immune from the inspectors&#x27; visits. This immunity may also have been due to the small numbers of inspectors employed – perhaps only two or three for the whole of Dublin.

==Reputation==
The inspectors were reputed to be particularly intrusive when carrying out their duties as evidenced by the Phil Chevron lyric in &quot;Faithful Departed&quot; which suggests that in addition to the &quot;boogie man&quot;, one can be &quot;Rattled by the glimmer man&quot; in the sense of being alarmed by their anticipated arrival.

==Historiography==
In the 21st century doubt has been cast on whether in fact there were ever house to house inspections carried out by gas supply company officials. But one oral history graphically describes a glimmer man&#x27;s inspections &quot;He came to our house I think about twice. He came at a very civil time of the day, when there nothing doing, you know? ... When he came into our house he put his hands over the thing and put powder on it then… with the powder, I don&#x27;t know what time it would have to be since they were on, but he&#x27;d put the powder on, but we never got in any trouble over it. After a while everybody got to know them (laughs) &quot;it&#x27;s the glimmerman&quot; and you&#x27;d be pouring water over it.&quot; Another writer describes the tribulations of a neighbouring widow to get reconnected and the lengths his mother went to avoid being detected using &quot;the glimmer&quot; but concedes that his house never received a visit. On the other hand, Irish secondary school history students are expected to have a knowledge of the topic and be able to comment on its significance.

&quot;The Irish Times&quot; also mentions the glimmerman in several Emergency-era issues (1942–45), including a robbery of a shop by a man pretending to be the glimmerman; a lengthy piece on the topic by Myles na gCopaleen; and a piece on children&#x27;s street songs, in which glimmer men appeared among the subjects with Queen Caroline and Alfie Byrne.

==Legacy==
Notwithstanding that the phenomenon of the glimmer man was transitory, perhaps much improved with the telling, and had in any event disappeared prior to the middle of the 20th century, it appears to have left an impact on the psyche of the Irish and not just those who lived through the Emergency period. The glimmer man is frequently referred to (as referenced here) in formal histories, blogs and websites newspaper and magazine articles, as well as oral histories and memoirs even if only in passing.

The impact is however most pronounced on those who did have direct experience such that the poet Paul Perry in &quot;The gas stove and the glimmerman&quot; describes how the memory is as significant to an old woman as that of the politician Éamon de Valera:
&#x27;She’s gas; her eyes hold the best 
part of the century. She’ll tell you about the Black &#x27;n Tans,
Dev, the gas stove and the glimmerman.
May the Glimmerman never return.
— from &quot;Of The Gas Stove and the Glimmerman&quot; by Paul Perry in &quot;The Drowning of the Saints&quot;, Salmon Poetry (2003)
The term is now applied metaphorically, particularly in Ireland, to any perceived intrusion into privacy (especially of a bureaucratic nature).

<text>The 2003 Spanish Grand Prix (formally the XLV Gran Premio Marlboro de España) was a Formula One motor race held on 4 May 2003 at the Circuit de Catalunya in Montmeló, Spain. It was the fifth round of the 2003 Formula One season and the forty-fifth Spanish Grand Prix, and also the last held on this layout. The 65-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher in a Ferrari car after starting from pole position. Ferrari debuted their new car, the F2003-GA at this race. GA was added to the cars name as a tribute to Gianni Agnelli, head of Fiat, who died shortly before the car&#x27;s unveiling. Fernando Alonso finished second driving for the Renault team with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Ferrari. Ralph Firman scored his one and only point by finishing eighth.

<text>Tremadog Bay (also spelled Tremadoc Bay; ), is a shallow inlet of Cardigan Bay in North Wales. It comprises the area between Mochras (Shell Island) in the east and the Trwyn Cilan headland of the Llŷn Peninsula in the west. The Sarn Badrig reef extends south-west from Mochras and forms a natural barrier between Tremadog Bay and Cardigan Bay proper. 

The Afon Glaslyn flows into the north of the bay and Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Islands lie at the western end of the bay. The towns of Pwllheli, Criccieth, Porthmadog, and Harlech lie directly on the bay.

<doc id="635253" wikidata="Q7332179" url="?curid=635253" title="Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot">
<text>Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot is a series of children&#x27;s graphic novels written by Dav Pilkey (best known for his &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; books) and first seven books illustrated by Martin Ontiveros and all nine books illustrated by Dan Santat. In each book, Ricky Ricotta, a mouse, with the help of his mighty robot, saves the world from an evil villain. The books also have an alien animal from a different planet in order from closest-to-sun to farthest-from-sun including Earth, as the villain of the first book is from Earth. The reader could see the villains being jailed in each series and later notice the familiar villains from previous books.

==Publication history==
The first three books were initially published as &quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Giant Robot&quot;. Dav Pilkey stopped using Giant in 2002 after many young fans pointed out that the Robot is not a giant. He&#x27;s just 12 times taller than a mouse, so he&#x27;s only about tall. Many young readers suggested the adjective &quot;Mighty&quot; instead, so after careful consideration, Pilkey changed the title of all the books.

Dan Santat replaced Martin Ontiveros as the illustrator in 2014 and had the first seven books re-drawn by Santat plus illustrated the remaining two books that were not published with Ontiveros as the illustrator. Books 1 through 5 with Santat&#x27;s illustrations were released in 2014, books 6 and 7 were released in 2015, and the new books 8 and 9 were released in 2016. This happened in 2012 when a Ricky Ricotta fan in Canada begged Pilkey for more Ricky Ricotta books. Shortly after that, his editor and the publisher decided to not only create more Ricky Ricotta books but also to re-illustrate the previous books modernly in colors plus add never-before-seen mini-comics. Pilkey&#x27;s editor asked who he wanted for re-illustrations, and he chose Dan Santat as the only illustrator in mind. Fortunately for Pilkey, Santat agreed to re-illustrate all seven books, plus illustrate two new remaining, unpublished Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot adventures.

==Graphic novels==
===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot&quot; (2000) is by Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Martin Ontiveros (2000 version) and Dan Santat (2014 version), the first in the series. The book was initially called &quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Giant Robot&quot;. However, it was changed because the robot is only about 12 times taller than a mouse, and therefore, that does not make him very tall.

Ricky Ricotta is a lonely mouse who lives in the fictional city of Squeakyville. He always wishes he had a close companion to keep him company. Once Ricky starts school, he gets bullied because of his small size. Ricky was full of sadness because bullies picked on him. Ricky wishes that something big would happen. In a secret cave on a mountaintop, the crazed rat scientist, Dr. Stinky McNasty, creates a giant robot to destroy Earth. When the robot refuses to do so, Dr. Stinky zaps the robot as punishment. Luckily, though, Ricky happens to be watching at the time. He kicks a ball at the evil scientist, and the ray gun is smashed, forcing Dr. Stinky to retreat. When the robot sees what Ricky has done, he befriends him. Ricky shows his parents, teachers, and schoolmates how helpful the robot can be, but since the robot can&#x27;t fit in the house, Ricky resorts to stashing him in the garage.

Meanwhile, Dr. Stinky is plotting revenge. He brings a potion of hatred and feeds it to the classroom lizard. (At that time, Ricky&#x27;s teacher and classmates were on a field trip riding the robot.) The lizard becomes Dr. Stinky&#x27;s new, more obedient servant and attacks the robot when he returns. After Ricky&#x27;s robot bests the monster in battle, the lizard returns to normal. Enraged at what has just happened, Dr. Stinky decides to destroy the robot himself. He pulls out a rocket launcher, but Ricky jumps at Dr. Stinky just as he pulls the trigger. The rocket ends up landing on Dr. Stinky&#x27;s secret cave, destroying it. Dr. Stinky then bursts into tears, saying it has been a very bad day for him. Together, Ricky and his robot imprison the mad scientist in the city jail. During the cookout, Ricky talks to his parents about the adventures. He, therefore, hopes his Mighty Robot will be by his side when he says the line, &quot;That&#x27;s what friends are for.&quot;

===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Mutant Mosquitoes from Mercury&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Mutant Mosquitoes from Mercury&quot; (2000) is by Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Martin Ontiveros (2000 version) and Dan Santat (2014 version), the second in the series.

The story opens with a demonstration of how Ricky&#x27;s robot helps him out. Ricky looks through the robot&#x27;s telescopic eye, sees Mercury, and thinks it&#x27;s cool. But Mr. Mosquito does not feel the same since he lives on Mercury. Mr. Mosquito hates the long scorching days and the long freezing nights, so he tries to find a place with more favorable conditions. He decides on Earth and creates &quot;Mutant Mosquitoes,&quot; which Mr. Mosquito uses to take the world over. Meanwhile, Ricky spots the Mutant Mosquitoes, and he asks his teacher if he can go, but Ricky is refused because he has to finish his math test first. Thanks to his robot, Ricky solves the final problems in an instant.

The Mighty Robot defeats the mosquitoes with bug spray, sending them back to Mercury. Angry, Mr. Mosquito drags Ricky into his ship and turns into a robotic Mecha-Mosquito, which battles Ricky&#x27;s robot. However, Ricky&#x27;s Robot refuses to fight back because he is worried Ricky will get harmed if he does. Ricky distracts Mr. Mosquito by requesting to use the restroom and climbing out the window. With Ricky now out of danger, the robot battles the Mecha-Mosquito and defeats the menace. Mr. Mosquito laments having a bad day and is thrown in jail afterward. In the end, they go home with milk and grilled cheese. Ricky, therefore, hopes his robot will be by his side.

===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Voodoo/Video Vultures from Venus&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Voodoo Vultures from Venus&quot; (2001) is by Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Martin Ontiveros (2001 version) and Dan Santat (2014 version), the third in the series. The title was later updated, renaming the Voodoo Vultures to &quot;Video Vultures,&quot; likely because the Vultures do not use voodoo in the book.

The story starts when Ricky Ricotta and his Mighty Robot are late for supper because they were in the Hawaii collecting seashells. Ricky&#x27;s mom says that Ricky and his robot have been late for supper three times that week and tells them that they cannot watch TV until they both learn the value of responsibility. Since the Mighty Robot is unfamiliar with responsibility, Ricky explains that it means doing the right thing at the right time. Of course, while the duo is good at the right things, they have trouble with &quot;doing them at the right time&quot;. Ricky and his robot sleep under the stars while every other mouse in Squeakyville watches TV.

Meanwhile, on Venus, the Voodoo/Video Vultures are frustrated with the unbearably hot atmosphere of their planet, which reduces their food into a melted mess. Hoping to eat better food, they fire a transmission beam to all of the TVs in Squeakyville. All TVs broadcast a signal that hypnotizes all the mice watching TV. Ricky and his Mighty Robot realize the following day that the mice are hypnotized and have been ordered to bring food to the army of Voodoo/Video Vultures. Ricky comes up with a plan to stuff chocolate chip cookies with hot chili peppers. Ricky then pretends to be hypnotized and takes the cookies to the vultures. The Voodoo/Video Vultures fall for the trick and dance around in pain from the spicy taste. This gives the Mighty Robot some time to break the remote control. The Squeakyville mice are now free from hypnosis, and they all flee back to their houses.

Ricky&#x27;s Mighty Robot then grabs the tyrannical leader of the vultures, Victor Von Vulture, and then battles against Voodoo/Video Vultures. In the end, the Mighty Robot wins the fight. The Voodoo/Video Vultures then fly back to Venus, except for Victor Von Vulture. The Mighty Robot and Ricky then put him in jail, and Ricky arrogantly brags at Victor Von Vulture, saying that he needs to learn responsibility. Ricky and his Mighty Robot then come home just in time for supper as Ricky&#x27;s parents are very proud of them for learning their responsibility. The story ends with Ricky and his Mighty Robot watching &quot;Rocket Rodent&quot; on TV, complete with TV dinners.

===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Mecha Monkeys from Mars&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Mecha-Monkeys from Mars&quot; (2002) is by Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Martin Ontiveros (2002 version) and Dan Santat (2014 version), the fourth in the series.

Ricky and his robot grow tired of playing hide-and-seek, so they decide to skateboard instead. However, there is no skateboard big enough for the Mighty Robot to ride on, so Ricky resorts to using his parents&#x27; minivan. After Ricky and his robot accidentally destroy the minivan, Ricky&#x27;s parents scold them for what they&#x27;ve just done. On Mars, Major Monkey still feels lonely, even after building many Robo-Chimps for company. So he decides to enslave the mice on Earth, but not before disposing of the Mighty Robot first.

Ricky and his robot are trying to figure out how to deal with the problem about the minivan when a space mouse floats down to Earth, telling the robot about trouble on Mars. Ricky&#x27;s robot follows the ship, but it is a trap. (The &quot;space mouse&quot; is revealed to be Major Monkey.) With the robot captured, Major Monkey and his army of Mecha-Monkeys launch an all-out assault on Squeakyville. Ricky feels terrible about what happened to his friend and wonders what to do about it. A general from SASA arrives to save his robot from Mars. When Ricky approaches the lab, it turns out to be an Orangu-Tron. Ricky infiltrates the lab and frees his robot from the mech&#x27;s clutches, then sets it to self-destruct.

The Mighty Robot takes the shuttle back to Earth, and after fighting the rest of the machines, Major Monkey is peeved because the monkeys are monkeying around. When the Mecha-Monkeys are defeated, they return to Mars, and Major Monkey realizes that he has made a big mistake. As payment for his mistake, Ricky and his robot put Major Monkey in the Squeakyville Jail. When the SASA general asks how they can repay Ricky and his robot, Ricky requests a new minivan. Ricky&#x27;s parents race home the heroes in their new rocket-powered minivan, and everyone has cheese pizza and root beer for dinner.

===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Jurassic Jackrabbits from Jupiter&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Jurassic Jackrabbits from Jupiter&quot; (2002) is a children&#x27;s novel by Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Martin Ontiveros (2002 version) and Dan Santat (2014 version), the fifth in the series.

It is Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s birthday, and his parents plan to take him to the dinosaur museum with his annoying cousin, Lucy (&quot;Oh, NO! Not Lucy! She is a little pest!&quot;). Meanwhile, on Jupiter, General Jackrabbit plans to take over Earth. He goes to Earth in his rocket ship, which lands on the dinosaur museum. Lucy, Ricky, and his parents notice the skulls on the dinosaur skeletons are gone, which General Jackrabbit stole. Ricky and his Mighty Robot then go the rooftop of the museum. They find the spaceship there. General Jackrabbit then gets some hairs from his tail and puts them in the DNA machine with the dinosaur skulls (the DNA strands were incomplete), and then the machine works. Three eggs pop out of the machine. They then hatch (into a Rabbidactyl, Trihareatops, and a Bunnysaurus Rex). Then, General Jackrabbit makes them grow bigger with his &quot;Meany Machiney&quot;.

The Mighty Robot confronts the Jackrabbits, but General Jackrabbit blasts the Jackrabbits with the Meany Machiney again. The Jackrabbits defeat the Mighty Robot. Ricky wants to save his robot, so he rings the doorbell on General Jackrabbit&#x27;s rocket ship. Two Robo-Rabbits open the door, replying that they will only accept Jackrabbits. Ricky gets help from Lucy when she disguises herself as a Jackrabbit. The Robo-Rabbits fall in love with Lucy. While the Robo-Rabbits bake food for her, Ricky sneaks upstairs and finds General Jackrabbit with the Meany Machiney. General Jackrabbit smells carrot cake, so he goes downstairs to see what the Robo-Rabbits are up to. Ricky then switches the complex controls from &quot;Big, Ugly &#x27;N&#x27; Evil&quot; to &quot;Little, Cute &#x27;N&#x27; Sweet&quot; and then zaps the Jurassic Jackrabbits. When the General catches Ricky messing around with his machine, Lucy hits General Jackrabbit in the face with a pie. Then, the three rabbits are put into their rocket ship and thrown back to their home planet by the Mighty Robot. Ricky and the Mighty Robot return the dinosaur skulls and bust General Jackrabbit. Lucy finds the little Jurassic Jackrabbits cute and keeps them as pets before it was time for Ricky&#x27;s birthday; (&quot;to eat pizza, Ricky blows candles, and everyone eats the cake.&quot;)

===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Stupid Stinkbugs from Saturn&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Stupid Stinkbugs from Saturn&quot; (2003) is a children&#x27;s novel by Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Martin Ontiveros (2003 version) and Dan Santat (2015 version), the sixth in the series.

When they play cops and robbers in their yard, Ricky wants to be the robber because he is good at hiding, and his robot wanted to be the cop because he is good at finding things. Ricky tells his robot that using x-ray vision is cheating. Ricky and his robot then have to visit Ricky&#x27;s Uncle Freddie, Aunt Ethel, and his annoying cousin Lucy, who has adopted the Jurassic Jackrabbits from the previous book and named them &quot;Fudgie&quot;, &quot;Cupcake&quot;, and &quot;Waffles&quot;. Ricky gets irritated because Lucy always wants to play Princess. (&quot;Lucy will be the beautiful princess, Ricky will be the ugly prince, Cupcake, Fudgie, and Waffles will be the royal ponies, and the Mighty Robot will be the brave knight&quot;) Meanwhile, on the dark, smelly, polluted world of Saturn, Sergeant Stinkbug grows tired of the planet and decides to find another world to dump junk. Sergeant Stinkbug decides to kidnap Earth&#x27;s leader and spies on the planet. When he sees Lucy, Sergeant Stinkbug swoops down to Earth and kidnaps her while Ricky and his robot and the three Jurassic Jackrabbits are snacking away.
While Sergeant Stinkbug tries to interrogate Lucy, her Jurassic Jackrabbits come to the rescue. However, Sergeant Stinkbug summons a few of his greatest stinkbug warriors and gives them &quot;Grow-Big Gumballs&quot;, causing them to grow. The Mighty Robot battles well against them at first, but Sergeant Stinkbug gives them more Gumballs, making them bigger than they were before. Fudgie and Cupcake manage to swipe the Gumballs from under the stinkbugs&#x27; noses, and Ricky chomps them down. Once he is as big as the stinkbugs, Ricky battles against them and wins. But then, he soon realizes that he still needs to get rid of the foes. Ricky then sees that Lucy had eaten the rest of the Gumballs (as she enjoys eating them), and has grown way bigger than anyone else. She grabs the rest of the stinkbugs, stuffs them back inside the spaceship, and hurls them back to Saturn. Fudgie and Cupcake find &quot;Super-Shrinking Saltwater Taffy&quot; and feed it to the two cousins. Once they are back to normal, they throw Sergeant Stinkbug into Squeakyville Jail.

When Ricky and Lucy get back and tell everyone what happened, the adults think it is all just part of a game they were playing. Ricky&#x27;s father is happy that Ricky played nice with Lucy, though. The book finishes with the heroes celebrating their victory.

===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Uranium Unicorns from Uranus&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Uranium Unicorns from Uranus&quot; (2005) is a children&#x27;s novel by written Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Martin Ontiveros (2005 version) and Dan Santat (2015 version), the seventh in the series.

The book starts with Ricky trying to play with his mighty robot, but he is unable to do certain things with his robot due to his massive size, saying the lines &quot;This is fun!&quot; every time the robot is able to successfully do something and &quot;This is NOT fun&quot; every time they fail. Ricky wishes that his Mighty Robot would have someone to play with himself; however, Ricky&#x27;s wish actually turns out to be a plan of the evil Uncle Unicorn, whose planet is now polluted, as previous villains now dump their trash there. Uncle Unicorn creates a Ladybot, certain that he will be the first one to succeed at conquering Earth. Seemingly, Uncle Unicorn does, and Ricky&#x27;s robot, hypnotized, falls in love with the Ladybot and gets abducted, unknown to Ricky, who now regrets his wish. Ricky&#x27;s parents asked him to tuck him in tonight, but Ricky declines and goes to bed with a sad heart. Finally, he decides to find his robot and does so in the woods, where his robot is chained to a rocket ship and guarded by Uncle Unicorn&#x27;s Uranium Unicorns, who are under the command of the Ladybot beside the evil Uncle Unicorn. Ricky, shocked, stops by his cousin Lucy&#x27;s house to borrow her Jurassic Jackrabbit, Waffles, along with Lucy herself. However, upon entering the Ladybot, they are captured by Uncle Unicorn and tied up, hanging above the Generator.

Ricky discovers that the Generator is sensitive to water and tries to sweat more and spit. He asks Lucy to spit for him, but she refuses when she thinks princesses do not spit. Ricky thinks up a plan and makes Lucy burst into tears by saying that everything she loves will be destroyed (&quot;ice cream, chocolate chip cookies, cotton candy, coconut cream pie, vanilla wafers, and grape lollipops&quot;). The robot breaks free of the spell and battles the Unicorns. However, Uncle Unicorn starts the backup generator and makes the Ladybot grow into a bigger, deadlier machine ... who trips over almost immediately after activating. The heroes discover the reason why - her shoelaces were tied together by none other than Fudgie and Cupcake, the other two Jurassic Jackrabbits. Ricky&#x27;s robot throws the Ladybot and the Uranium Unicorns into space and puts Uncle Unicorn in prison, which is getting quite crowded. The book ends with Ricky brushing the robot&#x27;s teeth, putting on the robot&#x27;s pajamas, and tucking him to bed. Ricky&#x27;s parents were glad that they were having fun again since they are different before Ricky reads a bedtime story to his robot.

===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Naughty Nightcrawlers from Neptune&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Naughty Nightcrawlers from Neptune&quot; (2016) is a children&#x27;s novel by Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Dan Santat. The 8th book in the series, it released in 2016 after spending over a decade in development hell.

Before Ricky&#x27;s parents go shopping, they tell him and the robot not to make any mess while they are gone. Ricky and his robot build a fort using debris from an abandoned building. But Farmer Feta, Ricky&#x27;s next door neighbor, is annoyed by all the commotion. When Ricky&#x27;s parents return home and notice the stylish fort, Ricky&#x27;s mother is most displeased and calls it a mess. Later, Ricky&#x27;s aunt and uncle arrive with cousin Lucy and her Jurassic Jackrabbits. Lucy calls the fort a castle and says it should be painted pink, much to Ricky&#x27;s dismay.

Meanwhile, on planet Neptune, Nimrod Nightcrawler is planning to take over Earth due to the environment being clouded by methane vapors from fossil fuel digging and forcing the nightcrawlers to live underground. However, he knows that Ricky and the Mighty Robot stand in his way and wants to avoid the other villains&#x27; mistakes. Nimrod launches a rocket with an inflatable teleporter (wormhole) to planet Earth, which crash-lands on Farmer Feta&#x27;s property. Through the wormhole, Nimrod convinces the Farmer that he can stop Ricky and his robot for their annoyances by digging tunnels under his property. The army of Naughty Nightcrawlers dig straight under Ricky&#x27;s fort, causing the ground to become unstable. When the robot tries to save the fort, the ground gives way and the robot ends up falling into the pit, imprisoned by the rubble from the ruined fort. Farmer Feta owns up to his mistake, and the kids decide to enter the wormhole.

Finding themselves in Neptune&#x27;s caverns, Ricky and Lucy happen upon nightcrawler guards watching the destruction of Squeakyville. Unfortunately, their presence is given away, and the guards put the squeeze on their uninvited guests. The heroes tickle the nightcrawlers to release their grip and head back to Earth through the wormhole, but the nightcrawlers follow and trap their prey. At that moment, the Mighty Robot comes to the rescue, having been dug up by the drilling suit Lucy rode on the way back. The Nightcrawlers retreat through the wormhole, and the robot takes on Nimrod and his army, who are still wreaking havoc in the city. After the Naughty Nightcrawlers&#x27; defeat, Nimrod himself is taken to the Squeakyville Jail.

There is still the issue of the big mess in the backyard, but Ricky remedies the issue by using the wormhole. Everyone dumps all the scrap into the wormhole, and it winds up in the nightcrawler tunnels on Neptune, crushing their technology in the process. With the wormhole powered down, a deep pit remains in the yard, but Lucy turns it into an artificial pond. The story concludes with Ricky, the Robot (using the deactivated wormhole as his inflatable tube), Lucy, and her pets swimming around in the backyard pond.

===&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Unpleasant Penguins from Pluto&quot;===

&quot;Ricky Ricotta&#x27;s Mighty Robot vs. the Unpleasant Penguins from Pluto&quot; (2016) is a children&#x27;s novel by Dav Pilkey and illustrated by Dan Santat. The 9th book in the series, it released in 2016 after spending over a decade in development hell.

Ricky and his robot are having fun in their backyard pond until cousin Lucy shows up. She pours pink bubble bath in the pond, thinking it will be glamorous. However, Ricky disagrees, and calls out on Lucy while the adults are playing cards. Ricky&#x27;s parents scold him for being mean, but Lucy starts crying and leaves before Ricky can get the change to apologize.

On the world of Pluto, President Penguin is feeling dishonored that his home world is no longer considered a planet. Determined to teach Earth to show respect, the President sets off to Earth to have everyone repay the insult.

Back on Earth, Ricky decides to show Lucy how sorry he really is (he has to explain the meaning of &quot;making amends&quot; since the robot is unfamiliar). The robot flies Ricky to Hawaii to gather beautiful wildflowers, and when the two return, they spend all night planting them on a mountain in Squeakyville for Lucy to see. At daybreak, President Penguin&#x27;s spaceship lands on the mountain. Ricky calls Lucy and tells her about the surprise he has for her. When Lucy spies the castle-like spaceship on the mountain with her name planted in flowers (the surprise was the flowers spelling the phrase &quot;HOORAY FOR LUCY&quot;. President Penguin lands on the word &quot;HOORAY&quot;), Lucy and her Jurassic Jackrabbits race to the spaceship, unaware that the ship is not actually part of the surprise. When Lucy and her pets approach the President&#x27;s head guards, Clancy and Nigel, the penguins treat Lucy as a real princess and bake goods for her in the &quot;castle&quot;.

Meanwhile, President Penguin has launched an invasion on the city of Squeakyville. Ricky and his robot catch sight of the Penguin-Mobiles and try to halt the assault, but the machines encase the robot&#x27;s feet in ice with their freezer beams. Lucy and her pets hear the commotion, and when they see what has happened, Clancy and Nigel explain the reason behind the President&#x27;s actions. Knowing that she must help her cousin, Lucy tries to intervene, but President Penguin subdues them as well. At that moment, two missiles from nowhere clip the two Penguin-Mobiles guarding the Mighty Robot. It turns out that Clancy and Nigel are intervening as well (&quot;we are making amends&quot;), and they destroy the President&#x27;s Penguin-Mobile. The explosion sends everyone flying, and after the Mighty Robot saves Ricky in the nick of time, President Penguin is put into the cooler. With the Squeakyville Jail now full, an expansion is under construction. 

Then, Lucy declares Clancy and Nigel as Pluto&#x27;s new Presidents. Having made amends, Clancy and Nigel take the captain and the first mate and fly back to Pluto. At home, Ricky and the robot welcome Lucy and her pets to the pond, having fun together. Ricky&#x27;s parents thank their son for apologizing and making amends to Lucy. The book ends with everyone having a pond party.
