<text>Joseph Galloway (1731August 29, 1803) was an American attorney and a leading political figure in the events immediately preceding the founding of the United States in the late 18th-century. As a staunch opponent of American independence, he would become one of the most prominent Loyalists in North America during the early part of the Revolutionary War.

The son of a wealthy landowner, Galloway became close friends with Benjamin Franklin through his law studies in the late 1740s. His association with Franklin and his father-in-law&#x27;s relationship with the Penn family drew him into the political drama then unfolding in the American colonies. Galloway was elected to the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly in 1756 when he was just 25. He would go on to serve for 18 years, eight of them as assembly speaker.

In 1774, Galloway led the Pennsylvania delegation in the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, where as a conservative he proposed a plan for forming a union between the colonies and Great Britain. After the Congress failed to adopt his Plan of Union, he signed the Continental Association, an agreement uniting the colonies in a boycott of British goods. Unhappy with the radical directions being taken, Galloway quit the Assembly and refused election to the Second Continental Congress in May 1775. Remaining loyal to the king, he opposed the adoption of the Declaration of Independence the next year.

Three months after the Declaration&#x27;s signing, Galloway fled to New York to join the British. As a top advisor to William Howe, the commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, he provided crucial intelligence, assisted in planning attacks on Continental Army troops, and personally recruited upwards of 80 spies. With the capture of Philadelphia in September 1777, Howe appointed Galloway to govern the city as Superintendent of both Police and Port.

When the British abandoned Philadelphia in June 1778, Galloway escaped to England and was convicted of high treason in absentia by the Pennsylvania Assembly; his estates were confiscated. Through the end of the war, Galloway was a leader of the loyalist cause in exile, a group of between 80,000 and 100,000 displaced colonists. He would never return to the Americas, nor again see his wife whom he had left behind in hopes of recovering his properties.

==Early life==
Galloway was born near West River, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, the son of Peter Bines Galloway and Elizabeth Rigbie. Galloway was a fourth generation Marylander, his Quaker forebears arriving in the colonies in 1649. In 1740, he moved with his father to Pennsylvania where he received a liberal schooling. He studied law, for a time alongside William Franklin, the son of Benjamin Franklin and later a fellow Loyalist, and he was admitted to the bar and began to practice law in Philadelphia.

On October 18, 1753, Galloway married Grace Growdon. In doing so, he relinquished his place in the Quaker faith. Her father, Laurence Growdon, was even wealthier than the Galloways, well placed in the political and social lives of Philadelphia. Both Galloway and his wife had strong personalities, and consequently, theirs was an unhappy union.

==Political career==
Galloway was a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from 1756 to 1774 and served as speaker of the House from 1766 to 1774. He was a prominent member of the faction which opposed Pennsylvania being a proprietary colony of the Penn family, and he called for it to be turned into a crown colony. He was a Loyalist, believing that most Americans would prefer to remain loyal to the Crown if only they were given a legitimate and effective government that would inspire their loyalty.

Galloway was a member of the Continental Congress in 1774, where he proposed a compromise plan for Union with Great Britain which would provide the colonies with their own parliament subject to the Crown. The Continental Congress rejected it by one vote. He signed the Continental Association, while he was opposed to independence for the Thirteen Colonies and remained loyal to the king. He was a resident of Philadelphia and an associate of Benjamin Franklin with whom he corresponded over the issues of American independence. In 1768, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society, which Franklin founded, and served as vice president of the organization from 1769 to 1776.

Galloway urged reform of the imperial administration and was critical of the trade laws, the Stamp Act of 1765, and the Townshend Acts enacted in 1767, and he had a conciliatory plan to end the disputes between Britain and the colonies. He believed that the British had the right to tax and govern the colonies, keep the peace, and help the colonies to survive and flourish. Congress voted to expunge Galloway&#x27;s plan from their journal, so he published it himself in 1775, reprimanding Congress for ignoring his analysis of Parliament&#x27;s powers and colonial rights. He proposed a written constitution and joint legislature for the whole British Empire.

==American War of Independence==
In 1775, the Assembly rejected Galloway&#x27;s urging that it abandon its struggle for independence from Britain, so Galloway left the Assembly and the Congress. In the winter of 1777, he joined General William Howe and accompanied him on his Philadelphia campaign. During the British occupation of Philadelphia, he was appointed superintendent of police and headed the civil government. He efficiently organized the Loyalists in Philadelphia, but the British were driven out of the city in 1778 following France&#x27;s entry into the war. The British retreated to New York, and Galloway went with them.

When Benjamin Franklin departed for France in 1776, he left behind a chest of his papers, containing letters and manuscripts, and entrusted them to Galloway for safe keeping in his personal residence, Trevose Manor, just north of Philadelphia. At some point between 1776 and 1778, Trevose Manor was raided; some of Franklin&#x27;s papers were stolen, while others were left scattered around as a result of the raid. The identities of the raiders were disputed, and modern historians note that no concrete information exists as to their identity.

==Exile in Britain==
In 1778, he fled to Britain with his daughter Elizabeth, never to return to the United States. There, her would become a leading spokesman of American Loyalists in London. The General Assembly of Pennsylvania convicted him of high treason and confiscated his estates, which included Trevose Manor, now known as Growdon Mansion, and much of the land that is now Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania. In 1779, he appeared as a government witness in a parliamentary enquiry into the conduct of Lord Howe and General Howe during the Philadelphia Campaign, of which he was deeply critical. When Galloway fled Philadelphia with the British, his wife Grace remained in the city with the hope of retaining the rights of their property (her ancestorial property). They expected that she would be able to join her daughter and husband afterwards, but Charles Willson Peale evicted her.

Galloway was influential in convincing the British that a vast reservoir of Loyalist support could be tapped by British initiatives, thus setting up the British invasion of the American South. After the war, he spent his remaining years in religious studies and writing. He died a widower in Watford, Hertfordshire on August 29, 1803; his wife had died on February 6, 1782.

<doc id="648069" wikidata="Q3115867" url="?curid=648069" title="Homestead Grays">
<text>The Homestead Grays (also known as Washington Grays or Washington Homestead Grays) were a professional baseball team that played in the Negro leagues in the United States.

The team was formed in 1912 by Cumberland Posey, and remained in continuous operation for 38 seasons. The team was originally based in Homestead, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Pittsburgh. By the 1920s, with increasing popularity in the Pittsburgh region, the team retained the name &quot;Homestead&quot; but crossed the Monongahela River to play all home games in Pittsburgh, at the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; home Forbes Field and the Pittsburgh Crawfords&#x27; home Greenlee Field.

From 1940 until 1942, the Grays played half of their home games in Washington, D.C., while remaining in Pittsburgh for all other home stands. As attendance at their games in the nation&#x27;s capital grew, by 1943, the Grays were playing more than two-thirds of their home games in Washington.

==Franchise history==
The Grays grew out of an earlier industrial team. In 1900, a group of African-American players had joined together to form the Germantown Blue Ribbons, an industrial league team. For ten years, the Blue Ribbons fielded a team every season and played some of the best sandlot teams in the area. In 1910, the managers of the team retired. The players reorganized the team and named themselves the Murdock Grays. In 1912, they became the Homestead Grays, the name they retained for the remainder of the franchise&#x27;s history.


===American/East-West League===
The Grays did join the American Negro League in 1929, but that league lasted only one season. Cumberland Posey was their inaugural manager in organized league play. The Grays went 32-29 (with three ties) for a fourth place finish. The team operated independently again until 1932, when Posey organized the ill-fated East-West League; that league also collapsed before completing its first and only season. Jud Wilson and Posey combined to lead the 1932 team to a 24-16 record (with one tie) before the Grays joined the Negro National League in 1933

===Period of dominance in the National League===
Posey managed the next two seasons, leading them to a 3rd and 7th place finish, respectively. Outfielder Vic Harris (a long-time player for the Grays) became player-manager in 1936. With the near-collapse of the Pittsburgh Crawfords, Josh Gibson returned to the Grays in 1937, combining with slugger Buck Leonard to power the Grays. From 1937 to 1948, the Grays went on an unprecedented run of success in Negro league baseball. They finished first place in the league in ten of twelve seasons while competing in organized playoff baseball in six of those seasons (which they won three).

Their one challenge for the Negro National League came in 1939, which matched the top four teams (of a six team league) in a postseason tournament that required three victories. They beat the Philadelphia Stars in five games to reach the Championship Series against the Baltimore Elite Giants. They lost to Baltimore in five games. The Grays rolled through the next two seasons with ease; in 1942, they competed in the re-born Negro World Series, which they lost in four games to the Kansas City Monarchs. For the 1943 and 1944 seasons, Candy Jim Taylor served as the manager for the Grays. They won the pennant each time to advance to the Series, which they won each time. Harris returned to manage the Grays for 1945, where he continued for four seasons. They went to the Series twice and won the 1948 Negro World Series, the final one to be played before the demise of quality in the leagues.

During their tenure in organized league baseball, the Grays went 629–377, which included a season each in the ANL and EWL and fifteen years spent with the Negro National League (where they went 573-332). They finished first place in the league ten times while reaching the Negro World Series (second incarnation) five times, which resulted in three championships. The Grays had just one losing season in their time in the National League (1935, when they finished 26-36), which was also one of only three times they ever finished in the bottom half of a league.

Pittsburgh Steelers founder and owner Art Rooney related in a 1981 interview that he &quot;from time to time&quot; had &quot;helped financially support the Negro League team, the Homestead Grays, and . . . was a better baseball fan than football fan.&quot;

===Post-Negro league play===
Following the collapse of the Negro National League after the 1948 season, the Grays struggled to continue as an independent club and joined the minor league Negro American Association. The Grays dominated the competition, won both halves of the split-season and cruised to the league pennant. The league collapsed after the 1949 season and the Grays returned to barnstorming. After completing their 1950 season, they ultimately disbanded in May 1951.

==Home fields==
From the late 1930s through the 1940s, the Grays played their home games at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Forbes Field, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and West Field in Munhall, PA. West Field still stands to this day with modern upgrades, and home plate is still in the exact position that Josh Gibson himself played catcher. The field is open to the public and currently used for the Steel Valley High School baseball teams home field.

However, during this same period the club adopted the Washington, D.C. area as its &quot;home away from home&quot; and scheduled many of its &quot;home&quot; games at D.C.&#x27;s Griffith Stadium, the home park of the Washington Senators. During these games, they were alternatively known as the Washington Grays or Washington Homestead Grays.

==Players==
===Baseball Hall of Fame inductees===
These Homestead Grays alumni have been inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum
=== AL/NL Players ===
The following players appeared in at least one game for the Grays and at least one game in the AL/NL.

* Luke Easter
* Dave Hoskins
* Luis Marquez
* Dave Pope
* Bob Thurman

==Playoffs/Championships==
===Independent===
===Negro National League===
* The Negro National League (second incarnation) ran from 1933 to 1948, and during that time they held a playoff to determine the league champion five times (1934, 1935, 1939, 1941, 1948). 1939 was the only time the league matched four teams together to play for the title, as all other playoffs were between two teams.
* On occasions without a playoff, the team leading the season in winning percentage was generally considered the pennant champion
* The Negro World Series was held 1924 to 1927 and from 1942 to 1948 as a matchup of two Negro leagues.

==Legacy==

On July 11, 2002, the Homestead High-Level Bridge which connects Pittsburgh to Homestead over the Monongahela River at Homestead was renamed the Homestead Grays Bridge in honor of the team.

===Washington Nationals===
When the Montreal Expos moved to Washington, &quot;Grays&quot; was one of the three finalists (along with &quot;Senators&quot; and the eventual winner &quot;Nationals&quot;) for the relocated team&#x27;s new name, reflecting Washington&#x27;s baseball history.

The Nationals′ home field, Nationals Park, includes numerous references to the Grays:

*The &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; on the facade behind home plate lists the names of Cool Papa Bell, Ray Brown, Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Cumberland Posey, Jud Wilson, and players from the Nationals, Expos, original Washington Senators of 1901–1960, and expansion Washington Senators of 1961–1971. The Ring honors players who are members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and had played &quot;significant years&quot; for at least one of the teams or &quot;anyone who has made a significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C.&quot; All six Grays players were among the original 18 inductees to the Ring of Honor when it was unveiled on August 10, 2010.
*The multi-sport Washington Hall of Stars display in the outfield features Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard.
*A statue of Josh Gibson (along with ones of original Senator Walter Johnson and second-run Senator Frank Howard) stands near the center field gate.

<text>The American Negro League (ANL) was one of several Negro leagues established during the period in the United States in which organized baseball was segregated. The ANL operated on the East Coast of the United States in 1929.

== History ==

The Eastern Colored League (ECL) had been the eastern of two major Negro leagues from 1923 through 1927 until its collapse during the 1928 season. Next winter the American Negro League was established by five former ECL teams—the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, the Baltimore Black Sox, the traveling Cuban Stars, the Hilldale Club of Darby, Pennsylvania, and the Lincoln Giants of New York City—along with the Homestead Grays, an important independent club.

== 1929 season ==

:&quot;Annual final standings: 1929&quot;
The ANL operated a split season: first half and second-half schedules with a planned playoff for a pennant in a post-season series between the two winners. The Baltimore Black Sox, led by player-manager Dick Lundy and Hall of Fame first baseman Jud Wilson, won both halves and they were awarded the pennant without a playoff.

== Demise ==

The league did not organize for the 1930 season, and it would not be until 1933 that an eastern Negro league would last for a full season.

Beside the downward economic spiral, bitter controversy in Baltimore and Philadelphia, about the local clubs continuing reliance on white umpires, may have been fatal to the league.

== Statistics ==

The ANL made a conscientious effort, unusual for the Negro leagues, to compile statistics for the league&#x27;s players. These were published at season&#x27;s end in the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;.

<doc id="648076" wikidata="Q134375" url="?curid=648076" title="Galich, Russia">
<text>Galich () is a town in Kostroma Oblast, Russia, located on the southern bank of Lake Galichskoye. As of the 2021 Census, its population was 12,856.

==History==
It was first chronicled in 1234 as Grad Mersky (lit. &quot;the town of the Merya&quot;). It gradually developed into one of the greatest salt-mining centers of Eastern Europe, eclipsing the southern town of Halych, from which it takes its name. In the 13th century, Galich was ruled by a younger brother of Alexander Nevsky and remained in his line until 1363, when the Muscovites seized the principality and ousted the ruling family to Novgorod.

The 15th and 16th centuries are justly considered the golden age of Galich. At that time it controlled most of the Russian trade in salt and furs. Dmitry Shemyaka and other local princes pressed their claims to the Muscovite crown, and three of them actually took possession of the Kremlin in the course of the Great Feudal War.

The early medieval earthen ramparts were further fortified in the early 15th and 16th centuries and have since been known as &quot;Shemyaka Hills&quot;. The Poles burnt it to the ground in 1612, Peter the Great had a wooden kremlin demolished, and it further declined with the transfer of Russian foreign trade from Arkhangelsk to St. Petersburg.

Town status was granted to Galich in 1778.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Galich serves as the administrative center of Galichsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Galich—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Galich is incorporated as Galich Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
The Galich Mobile Crane Plant () manufactures some 20% of Russia&#x27;s entire mobile crane production.

Town&#x27;s industries also manufacture steel barrels, shoes, and clothing. There is a timber mill in town as well.

The town is also a minor railroad node of the Trans-Siberian Railway.

A tall guyed mast for FM and TV broadcasting can be seen in the town.

==Culture==
Historic monuments of Galich include various buildings from the imperial period of Russian history. Particularly noteworthy is the , founded in the early 14th century and featuring a 16th-century five-domed cathedral and a three-domed church from 1642.

Since 2004, Galich hosts the annual short film festival &quot;Russia&#x27;s Family&quot; (, Semya Rossii), whose stated goals are &quot;to aid spiritual and moral healing of Russian society and to promote traditional family values&quot;.

<doc id="648077" wikidata="Q2242955" url="?curid=648077" title="GSS coding system">
<text>GSS codes are nine-character geocodes maintained by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Office for National Statistics (ONS) to represent a wide range of geographical areas of the UK, for use in tabulating census and other statistical data. GSS refers to the Government Statistical Service of which ONS is part.

GSS codes replaced a previous system called ONS codes from January 2011. ONS codes were hierarchical whereas in GSS codes there is no relation between the code for a lower-tier area and the corresponding parent area.

== Code formulation ==
GSS codes have a fixed length code of nine characters. The first three characters indicate the level of geography, and the six digits following define the individual unit. For example, the Royal Borough of Greenwich is coded as codice_1, Middlesbrough is codice_2, Cambridge codice_3 and Fenland codice_4.

, the meanings of some common three character prefixes are as follows:
In 2019, the House of Commons Library proposed names instead of numeric codes for MSOAs to make them easier to use. In 2021 the library created names for MSOAs for use within the house.

A full listing of GSS names and codes may be found by following the link to ONS Geography&#x27;s Code History Database, below.

== Geography of the UK Census ==
Information from the 2011 Census is published for a wide variety of geographical units. These areas include:

* Counties in England
* Districts within English counties, and unitary authority areas (where one council provides district and county functions)
* Unitary council areas in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland
* Civil parishes (communities in Wales)
* Electoral wards (electoral divisions in Wales). These areas are defined for the election of local councillors, but are also widely used for presenting statistics at a smaller scale than the whole district.
* Census output areas (OA), the smallest unit for which census data are published. They were initially generated to support publication of 2001 Census outputs and contain at least 40 households and 100 persons, the target size being 125 households. They were built up from postcode blocks &quot;after&quot; the census data were available, with the intention of standardising population sizes, geographical shape and social homogeneity (in terms of dwelling types and housing tenure). The OAs generated in 2001 were retained as far as possible for the publication of outputs from the 2011 Census (less than 3% were changed). Before 2001, census data was published for larger Enumeration Districts (ED) which were delineated before the census was conducted and were the organisational units for census data collection.

== Neighbourhood Statistics Geography ==

Super Output Areas (SOAs) are a set of geographical areas developed following the 2001 Census, initially to facilitate the calculation of the Indices of Deprivation 2004 and subsequently for a range of additional Neighbourhood Statistics (NeSS). The aim was to produce a set of areas of consistent size, whose boundaries would not change (unlike electoral wards), suitable for the publication of data such as the Indices of Deprivation. They are an aggregation of adjacent Output Areas with similar social characteristics. Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) typically contain 4 to 6 OAs with a population of around 1,500. Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) on average have a population of 7,200. The hierarchy of Output Areas and the two tiers of Super Output Areas have become known as the Neighbourhood Statistics Geography.

MSOAs use the name of the local or unitary authority followed by three digits, for example &quot;Tower Hamlets 022&quot; which is codice_5. LSOAs use the name of the containing MSOA followed by a letter, for example &quot;Tower Hamlets 022C&quot; which is codice_6.

Some LSOAs and MSOAs were revised in alignment with the 2021 Census.

== Former hierarchical coding system ==

The older ONS code was constructed top down: 
*A two-character code represented a county.
:For example, codice_7 for Cambridgeshire.
*A four-character code represented a district, so that the first two characters showed the county in which the district was placed.
:For example, codice_8 for Cambridge district or codice_9 for Fenland.
*In the case of a unitary authority (including metropolitan and London boroughs) the first two digits were 00.
:For example, codice_10 for Greenwich (London Borough) or codice_11 for Middlesbrough.
*Local Government wards were given a two-letter code within their local authority.
:For example, codice_12 for Petersfield Ward within Cambridge district. 
*The smallest level, Census OAs were originally given an additional 4 digits within a ward, so that the first output area in Petersfield Ward was coded codice_13.
*Civil parishes were also coded using this hierarchical system. Parishes were coded using an additional 3 digits after their local authority. For example, within codice_9 for Fenland district, the parish of Tydd St. Giles was coded codice_15.

<doc id="648078" wikidata="Q219747" url="?curid=648078" title="Sheer Heart Attack">
<text>Sheer Heart Attack is the third studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 8 November 1974 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Digressing from the progressive themes featured on their first two albums, the album featured more pop-centric and conventional rock tracks and marked a step towards the &quot;classic&quot; Queen sound. It was produced by the band and Roy Thomas Baker, and launched Queen to mainstream popularity in the UK and throughout the world.

The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Killer Queen&quot; reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and provided the band with their first top 20 hit in the US, peaking at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; was the first Queen album to hit the US top 20, peaking at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes Chart in 1975. It has been acknowledged for containing &quot;a wealth of outstanding hard rock guitar tracks&quot;. Retrospectively, it has been listed by multiple publications as one of the band&#x27;s best works and has been deemed an essential glam rock album.

==Background and recording==
After completing their second album, Queen embarked on their Queen II Tour as a support act for Mott the Hoople. After touring extensively throughout the UK, the two groups decided to tour together in the US, marking Queen&#x27;s first tour in the country. The bands would remain on friendly terms for the rest of their career, with Ian Hunter performing &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Queen played their first US show on 16 April 1974 in Denver, Colorado, as a support, which Freddie Mercury reportedly disliked, saying: &quot;Being support is one of the most traumatic experiences of my life&quot;. At the climax of the tour in Boston, Brian May was discovered to have hepatitis, possibly from the use of a contaminated needle during vaccinations the group received before travelling to Australia. The remainder of the tour was subsequently cancelled and Queen flew back home, where May was hospitalised.

In June, the band gathered together at Trident Studios to start rehearsing material for the album. Koh Hasebe interviewed Mercury, Taylor, and Deacon when they were rehearsing on 13 June. At the beginning of July, May joined them for rehearsals. The band were just preparing to record, and on 7 July, they trekked three and a half hours to get to the Rockfield Studios in Wales, where they would record ten backing tracks, finishing on 28 July. At the start of August, work shifted to Wessex Sound Studios. Work there would not last long, however, as May, who was starting to feel uneasy, went to a specialist clinic on 2 August. He collapsed at the clinic, as a result of a duodenal ulcer, and would be operated on the following day, but discharged from the hospital soon after so he could recover at home. While the band were overdubbing at Wessex, May booked studio time at AIR Studios, where he recorded &quot;Dear Friends&quot;, and &quot;She Makes Me&quot;. In the meantime, Taylor and Deacon made an appearance at an EMI/Radio Luxembourg motor rally at Brands Hatch on 11 August. By late August, May was working with the band again, and the rest of the band would add their parts to the songs he had recorded. There was still one song that needed to be recorded as the band worked into September, and that was &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot;. They recorded the backing track for this one at Wessex, and saved the rest to be completed during the mixing sessions.

Mixing commenced in the middle of September. The band were still overdubbing at this point, so they hired someone to deliver tapes from recording studio to mixing studio via motorcycle. The heart of the mixing sessions took place at Trident Studios, and one or two days was spent mixing each of the majority of the songs. &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, on the other hand, took four days to mix, with six hours&#x27; worth of different mixes created during that time. Each song was mixed in little edited sections that were about fifteen to twenty seconds in length. At this point, Trident had just installed a 24-track machine in their studio that had been around since 1972, but was not functioning until 1974. In fact, the album was Trident&#x27;s first 24-track project. Even though Trident had expanded their recording flexibility by eight tracks, it still wasn&#x27;t enough to mix each track individually. &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot;, for example, had 70 vocal tracks and had to be mixed down to work with the 24-track mixer.

On 20 September, it was announced the band were attempting to secure a release date for the album of 1 November, though it seemed unlikely they would be done in time to meet that deadline. They mixed &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot;, which was the last thing to be mixed, on 22 October. May did an interview the next day (which was published on 26 October) that explained what finishing the album was like. In total, the band used four different studios in the making of Sheer Heart Attack: most of the backing tracks were recorded at Rockfield, two backing tracks and some guitar overdubs were recorded at AIR Studios, most of the overdubs and one backing track were recorded at Wessex, and the mixing was done at Trident.

==Songs==
The album noticeably shifts away from the progressive rock themes of its predecessors, and has been categorised as hard rock&lt;ref name=&quot;prown/newquist&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and glam rock. The &quot;Daily Vault&quot; described it as &quot;an important transition album&quot; because it showcased &quot;what the band would soon become while giving a nod to their hard-rock past,&quot; while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic observed that, although there are still references to the fantasy themes of their earlier works, particularly on &quot;In the Lap of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot;, &quot;the fantasy does not overwhelm as it did on the first two records&quot;.

&quot;Killer Queen&quot; was written in a single night, which contrasts with the, as Mercury put it, &quot;ages&quot; it took to write &quot;The March of the Black Queen&quot;. &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; was written during the making of Queen II, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; had its genesis in Mercury&#x27;s pre-Queen band Wreckage, and Mercury wrote &quot;Flick of the Wrist&quot; during May&#x27;s illness-induced absence. As it included the first song written by John Deacon that Queen recorded (&quot;Misfire&quot;) alongside tracks written by the other members of the band, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; was the first of the group&#x27;s albums to contain at least one song written by each member; &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; was the band&#x27;s first song for which all four members shared the writing credit.

===&quot;Brighton Rock&quot;===

&quot;Brighton Rock&quot; was written by Brian May during the &quot;Queen II&quot; sessions, but was not recorded at that time, as the group felt it would not fit with the rest of the album. Lyrically, it tells the story of two young lovers named Jenny and Jimmy, who meet in Brighton on a public holiday. Mods travelling to Brighton on bank holidays was a popular narrative at the time, as in The Who&#x27;s &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.

The song includes a three-minute unaccompanied guitar solo interlude, which makes extensive use of delay to build up guitar harmony and contrapuntal melodic lines. It grew out of May&#x27;s experimentation with an Echoplex unit while he attempted to recreate his guitar orchestrations for live performances of &quot;Son and Daughter&quot;. He had made modifications to the original unit so he could change the delay times, and ran each echo through a separate amplifier to avoid interference.

The studio version of the solo only contains one &quot;main&quot; guitar and one &quot;echoed&quot; guitar for a short section, but, live, May would usually split his guitar signal into one &quot;main&quot; and two &quot;echoed&quot; guitars, with each going to a separate bank of amplifiers. In concert, the solo has been performed as part of &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, in a medley with another song, or as a standalone piece. For example, May performed some of it at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Considered one of May&#x27;s finest solos, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked it No. 41 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time&quot;.

===&quot;Killer Queen&quot;===

&quot;Killer Queen&quot; was written by Freddie Mercury and was the band&#x27;s first international hit single. Mercury played a jangle piano as well as a grand piano on the recording. After it charted as a single, the band performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

===&quot;Tenement Funster&quot;/&quot;Flick of the Wrist&quot;/&quot;Lily of the Valley&quot;===

Roger Taylor wrote &quot;Tenement Funster&quot; about youth and rebellion and sang lead vocals, while John Deacon played the song&#x27;s prominent acoustic guitar parts in May&#x27;s absence. It segues into Mercury&#x27;s &quot;Flick of the Wrist&quot; (which was released, along with &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, as a double A-sided single), and then into a softer, piano-based Mercury song, &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot;, making the three songs continuous.

===&quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot;===

&quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot; was written by May while hospitalised, and recalls the group&#x27;s early tour supporting Mott the Hoople. It was recorded during the last week of the sessions for the album, with May playing piano.

===&quot;In the Lap of the Gods&quot;===
&quot;In the Lap of the Gods&quot; was written by Mercury and featured multiple vocal overdubs from himself and Roger Taylor. It features one of the highest notes on the album, sung by Taylor. 

===&quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;===

&quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; was one of the earliest tracks that Queen performed live, and had several different arrangements before being recorded for &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;. No band member was able to remember who had written the lyrics when the album was released, so they shared the writing credit, the first of their songs to do so. The lyrics deal with gangsters and include a reference to Al Capone. The track has a fast tempo and heavy distortion, presaging speed metal. Music magazine &quot;Q&quot; described &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; as &quot;thrash metal before the term was invented&quot;. The song was played live at almost every Queen concert between 1974 and 1978.

Metallica covered the song as their contribution to the 1990 compilation album &quot;Rubáiyát: Elektra&#x27;s 40th Anniversary&quot;. This cover version won a Grammy Award in 1991; it also appeared on the band&#x27;s compilation &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;

===&quot;Dear Friends&quot;===
&quot;Dear Friends&quot; is a ballad written by May and sung by Mercury.
===&quot;Misfire&quot;===
&quot;Misfire&quot; was John Deacon&#x27;s first individual composition for the band, and featured him playing the guitar solo and all guitar parts on the track except for some parts at the end of the song, in which Brian&#x27;s Red Special becomes more prominent.
===&quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot;===
The title of &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot; alludes to the then-recent hit &quot;Bad Bad Leroy Brown&quot; by American singer-songwriter Jim Croce, who had died in a plane crash the previous year. Written by Mercury, &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot; features him playing grand piano and jangle piano, as well as doing multiple vocal overdubs. May plays a short section on ukulele-banjo, and Deacon plays a line on the double bass. DRUM! Magazine commended Taylor&#x27;s drum work on the song: &quot;It really shows off Taylor’s versatility. He nails dozens of kicks throughout this fast and tricky song and proves that he could’ve been a big band drummer or ably fit into any theatrical pit band if Queen hadn’t worked out so well for him. Honky-tonk piano, upright bass, ukulele-banjo, and a smokin&#x27; drummer all add up to a rollicking good time.&quot;

===&quot;She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilettoes)&quot;===
&quot;She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilettoes)&quot; was written and sung by May with him and Deacon playing acoustic guitars.
===&quot;In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited&quot;===
&quot;In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited&quot; was one of Queen&#x27;s set-closers from 1974 to 1977. During the 1986 Magic tour, it was performed again in a medley, where it segued into &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
At the time of its release, &quot;NME&quot; called the album: &quot;A feast. No duffers, and four songs that will just run and run: &#x27;Killer Queen&#x27;, &#x27;Flick of the Wrist&#x27;, &#x27;Now I&#x27;m Here&#x27;, and &#x27;In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; commended &quot;Brian May&#x27;s multi-tracked guitar, Freddie Mercury&#x27;s stunning vocalising and Roy Thomas Baker&#x27;s dynamic production work&quot;, calling the album &quot;a no-holds barred, full-scale attack on the senses&quot;. &quot;Circus&quot; referred to the album as &quot;perhaps the heaviest, rockingest assault on these shores we&#x27;ve enjoyed in some time&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded the album a positive rating of 3 stars and wrote: &quot;If it&#x27;s hard to love, it&#x27;s hard not to admire: this band is skilled, after all, and it dares.&quot; John Mendelsohn, however, was unimpressed, writing: &quot;I hunted all over both sides of this latest album for something, anything, even remotely as magnificent as &#x27;Keep Yourself Alive&#x27; or &#x27;Father to Son&#x27;, only to end up empty-eared and bawling.&quot; As 1974 drew to a close, the album was ranked by &quot;Disc&quot; as the third best of the year and tied for 24th place on &quot;NME&#x27;s&quot; end-of-year list.

In a review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Greg Kot awards the album a generally positive rating of 2 and a half stars, while noting that this album was where &quot;...the songs became more concise&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMusic said that &quot;the theatricality is now wielded on everyday affairs, which ironically makes them sound larger than life. And this sense of scale, combined with the heavy guitars, pop hooks, and theatrical style, marks the true unveiling of Queen, making &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; as the moment where they truly came into their own.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; called the record &quot;indispensable&quot; and &quot;one of the great pop/rock admixtures of the &#x27;70s&quot;. Pitchfork wrote: &quot;&quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; not only improves on every aspect of their sound suggested by the first two records, but delivers some of the finest music of their career ... this is the band at the height of its powers.&quot; Jon Bryan of &quot;Backseat Mafia&quot; described it as &quot;the first album where Queen got it unarguably right&quot;, noting that &quot;such obvious arrogance suited them&quot;.

Benjamin Ray of the &quot;Daily Vault&quot; felt that &quot;Queen somehow manages to sound like every rock band of the 70s on here, including Rush, Zeppelin and even Uriah Heep.&quot; However, he noted the difference was that &quot;Queen actually tries to be pretentious and bombastic, and often they are so over the top one can&#x27;t help but be entertained&quot;, finally concluding that it was &quot;their most fun and showcases everything they did right.&quot; The BBC wrote: &quot;they stretched contemporary production methods to their very limit with multi-layered vocals and guitars and Freddie&#x27;s vaudevillian streak finally emerged ... this was the album that finally saw Queen find their true voice.&quot; Rock historian Paul Fowles wrote that &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; &quot;saw the band become increasingly focused on the emerging cult figure of Mercury&quot; and his &quot;unique brand of rock theater&quot;, especially on the single &quot;Killer Queen&quot;.

On 8 November 2010, record company Universal Music announced that a remastered and expanded reissue of the album would be released in May 2011, as part of a new deal between Queen and Universal Music, which meant the band&#x27;s association with EMI Records would come to an end after almost 40 years. Queen&#x27;s entire studio catalogue was reissued in 2011.

<text>Ernst Johann Otto Hartert (29 October 1859 – 11 November 1933) was a widely published German ornithologist.

==Life and career==
Hartert was born in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg on 29 October 1859. In July 1891, he married the illustrator Claudia Bernadine Elisabeth Hartert in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, with whom he had a son named Joachim Karl (Charles) Hartert, (1893–1916), who was killed as an English soldier on the Somme.
Together with his wife, he was the first to describe the blue-tailed Buffon hummingbird subspecies (&quot;Chalybura buffonii intermedia&quot; Hartert, E &amp; Hartert, C, 1894). The article &quot;On a collection of Humming Birds from Ecuador and Mexico&quot; appears to be their only joint publication.

Hartert was employed by Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild as ornithological curator of Rothshild&#x27;s private Natural History Museum at Tring, in England from 1892 to 1929.

Hartert published the quarterly museum periodical &quot;Novitates Zoologicae&quot; (1894–39) with Rothschild, and the &quot;Hand-List of British Birds&quot; (1912) with Francis Charles Robert Jourdain, Norman Frederick Ticehurst and Harry Forbes Witherby. He wrote &quot;Die Vögel der paläarktischen Fauna&quot; (1910–22) and travelled in India, Africa, and South America on behalf of his employer. Although Hartert supported the conservation of some species of birds, he wrote a pamphlet in 1900 in which he supported the control of house sparrows.
In 1930, Hartert retired to Berlin, where he died in 1933.

Hartert had been a mentor to Erwin Stresemann, whose cremated remains were interred at Hartert&#x27;s grave in 1972.

==Works==
Among the written publications of Ernst Hartert are:

<doc id="648085" wikidata="Q1808766" url="?curid=648085" title="Prepared guitar">
<text>A prepared guitar is a guitar that has had its timbre altered by placing various objects on or between the instrument&#x27;s strings, including other extended techniques. This practice is sometimes called tabletop guitar, because many prepared guitarists do not hold the instrument in the usual manner, but instead place the guitar on a table to manipulate it.

The idea of altering an instrument&#x27;s timbre through the use of external objects has been applied to other instruments as well, most notably John Cage&#x27;s prepared piano, which preceded the prepared guitar.

==History==
With prepared guitars, one of the key goals in preparing the instrument is changing its timbre – the fundamental tone composition of the sound. This is typically achieved by placing objects on or under the strings. The objects can have a tone of their own, like for instance a pen spring, but can also cause strange string resonance effects or behave like a seesaw and create echoing or buzzing effects after being struck and swinging like a balance. Many of the sounds sound more or less like clocks, bells or Non Western musical instruments or even non string percussion instruments.

===Bjørn Fongaard===

The history of Norwegian composer and guitar player Bjørn Fongaard (1919–1980) probably marks the first steps into prepared guitar. He started off by constructing a quarter tone guitar with adaption of the fretboard, but very early left this in favour of a diverse set of prepared guitar techniques. His first pieces in this genre came in the mid 1960s.

===Keith Rowe===

The method of actually preparing the guitar was developed in the late 1960s by Keith Rowe, in imitation of Jackson Pollock&#x27;s painting method and John Cage&#x27;s prepared piano. Rowe developed various prepared guitar techniques: placing the guitar flat on a table and manipulating the strings, body and pickups in unorthodox ways to produce sounds described as dark, brooding, compelling, expansive and alien. He has been known to employ objects such as a library card, rubber eraser, springs, hand-held electric fans, alligator clips, and common office supplies in playing the guitar.

===Fred Frith===

Another pioneer was Fred Frith who in 1974 released a solo album called &quot;Guitar Solos&quot;. The album comprises eight tracks of unaccompanied and improvised music played on prepared guitars by Frith.
The album was recorded using a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. Frith added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound from both sides of the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately, that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channeled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.

===Other prepared guitarists===
In the 1980s Glenn Branca, Sonic Youth and other experimental art rockers also utilized prepared guitars. Koka Nikoladze developed a preparation technique, which afterwards was named &quot;Nikoladze&quot; Preparation. In this case an acoustic guitar was prepared with a certain type of a light bulb and produced synthetic - alike sound. The beautiful demonstration of upper mentioned technique is the composition &quot;Starshine ~&quot; for violin, prepared guitar and percussion.

Other contemporary prepared guitar composers/performers include:
* Dani Rabin of Marbin incorporated prepared guitar into the jazz-rock style in a non-avant-garde fashion.
* Duane Denison used prepared guitar with The Jesus Lizard and Legendary Shack Shakers.
* GP Hall (active since the late 1960s) uses a variety of guitars played with implements including psaltery bows, palette knives, electric fans and razors, wind-up toys, velcro and crocodile clips. Some of Hall&#x27;s techniques are similar to Keith Rowe&#x27;s methods but are applied to a much more melodic compositional and improvisational style.
* Steve Parry of Hwyl Nofio uses a prepared guitar technique and developed a bowed device based on the violin, utilizing paper clips, nails, a razor, pliers, bow, automata.
* Koka Nikoladze developed a guitar preparation technique with light bulb (2009), and played a standard acoustic guitar as a bowed instrument.
* Martín Irigoyen (of Vernian Process) and Erik Sanko both use electronic devices, hand ventilators, walkie-talkies, paper clips, aluminum foil, credit cards and tweezers.
* Nikita Koshkin uses cork, matches and foam mutes.
* Jacques Palinckx (active from the 1980s) from the Netherlands uses vibrators, radios, toys and knives.
* Cor Fuhler uses multiple vibrators and 3rd bridge on acoustic guitar.
* Micachu uses unorthodox instruments which are sometimes customised or homemade. These included a modified guitar played with a hammer action, called a &#x27;chu&#x27;. Other is a short scaled children guitar with an additional third bridge next to the sound hole which shortens the scale length, leading to an alternate microtonal division of the intervals.
* These Are Powers use a bass guitar with a rod placed between the strings and the body to shorten the string length, as well as playing behind that additional bridge like a tailed bridge guitar.
* Michael Chorney plays prepared-guitar
* Shane Parish of Ahleuchatistas places a wire in front of the bridge in some songs.
* Paolo Angeli uses a &quot;Sardinian prepared guitar&quot;: an orchestra-instrument with 18 cords, a hybrid between guitar, cello and drums, gifted with hammers, pedals at variable speed.

==Custom made instruments==

Beginning in the 1970s, guitarist and luthier Hans Reichel made some unusual guitars with third bridge-like qualities.

Yuri Landman derived a just intoned musical scale from an initially considered atonal prepared guitar playing technique based on adding a 3rd bridge under the strings. He constructed an instrument called the Moodswinger with this scale. When this bridge is positioned in the noded positions of the harmonic series the volume of the instrument increases and the overtone becomes clear and has a consonant relation to the complementary opposed string part creating a harmonic multiphonic tone.

<doc id="648088" wikidata="Q731544" url="?curid=648088" title="Kansas City Monarchs">
<text>The Kansas City Monarchs were the longest-running franchise in the history of baseball&#x27;s Negro leagues. Operating in Kansas City, Missouri, and owned by J. L. Wilkinson, they were charter members of the Negro National League from 1920 to 1930. Wilkinson was the first white owner at the time of the establishment of the team. In 1930, the Monarchs became the first professional baseball team to use a portable lighting system which was transported from game to game in trucks to play games at night, five years before any Major League Baseball team did. The Monarchs won ten league championships before integration, and triumphed in the first Negro World Series in 1924. The Monarchs had only one season in which they did not have a winning record and produced more major league players than any other Negro league franchise. It was disbanded in 1965.

==Negro National League==

The Monarchs were formed in 1920, primarily from two sources. Owner J. L. Wilkinson drew players from his All Nations barnstorming team, which had been inactive during World War I, and the 25th Infantry Wreckers, an all-black team recruited into the U.S. Army almost exclusively for their playing talent. He put together a collection of talent, including pitcher/outfielder Bullet Rogan, an eventual Hall of Famer who established himself as one of the most popular stars of the new league; sluggers Dobie Moore, Heavy Johnson, George Carr, and Hurley McNair; and pitchers Rube Currie and Cliff Bell. Immediate contenders, the Monarchs became bitter rivals to black baseball&#x27;s reigning power, Rube Foster&#x27;s Chicago American Giants. After three years of failing to break off the Giants&#x27; hold on the pennant, Wilkinson fired manager Sam Crawford in mid-1923, replacing him with veteran Cuban star José Méndez, who then led the Monarchs to the league championship.

Winning the pennant again in 1924, the Monarchs participated in the first Negro League World Series, defeating the Eastern Colored League champion Hilldale team from Darby, Pennsylvania, in a ten-game series (five wins, four losses, and one tie). In this series, Méndez had an ERA of 1.42 in four of the games and was responsible for a shutout in the one game he was the starting pitcher in. Motivated by the Monarchs&#x27; runaway pennant victory, NNL president Rube Foster changed the league schedule to a split-season format for 1925. However, Kansas City still took the league title again in 1925, but lost the World Series to Hilldale when Rogan was injured just before the series began, winning one game and losing five. 
Even though Méndez was the manager, he still pitched during the few years he held the position. Among the team&#x27;s regulars during these years were the second baseman/shortstop Newt Allen who in the 1924 series alone had a batting average of .282 and seven doubles and Frank Duncan. Newt Joseph played third base for the Monarchs from 1922 through their NNL years, hitting a composite .284 during that time.

In 1926 manager Méndez returned to Cuba, and Rogan took over as player/manager. He kept up the Monarchs&#x27; tradition of fine pitching, as the team&#x27;s staff over the next few years featured Negro league greats including Chet Brewer, William Bell, and lefty Andy Cooper. The club traded for legendary Cuban outfielder Cristóbal Torriente, but also permanently lost the services of star shortstop Dobie Moore, whose career ended that year due to a severe off-the-field injury. After winning the first-half pennant, the Monarchs dropped a best of nine playoff to the Chicago American Giants when Rogan lost both games of a series-closing doubleheader to the young Bill Foster, another eventual Hall of Famer. In 1928 the Monarchs narrowly missed a second-half title, but won both halves of the 1929 NNL title with the best overall single-season record ever compiled by a Negro league team at 62 wins and 17 losses. By this time, pitcher Andy Cooper who had made a name for himself by playing for seven years with the Detroit Stars had joined the Monarchs. No World Series was played that year between the Monarchs and the Baltimore Black Sox, champions of the eastern American Negro League.

==J.L. Wilkinson==
J.L. Wilkinson was the owner of the Kansas City Monarchs team from 1920 until the team was sold to Tom Baird in 1947. J.L. Wilkinson was the first person to use days like &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot; and &quot;Kid&#x27;s Day&quot;. These days were used to promote baseball and attract more players to the All Nationals Club to develop their talent and eventually be available to be placed on the Kansas City Monarch team. He was among the top businessmen and promoters for African American baseball. This helped the Kansas City Monarchs become a very stable and successful franchise. J.L. Wilkinson&#x27;s Kansas City Monarchs was the only team in the Negro Leagues to play against a comedic team even after there were regulations put in place so that other teams could avoid playing against the comedic team. This comedic team wore grass skirts, war paint, and bright uniforms with a clown on the front.

==Night baseball==
The Monarchs won four pennant championships before they introduced night baseball in the 1930s. The Kansas City Monarchs started playing night baseball to try to get more people to come to the games. the first night game was in early march, 1930 in Lawrence, Kansas. The Monarchs had portable light systems that could be transported on the team&#x27;s bus to any game. The lights were powered by portable generators and attached to retractable poles. This was the first team to regularly play baseball under artificial light, including the major league teams. Night baseball gave the Monarchs more time to play more games, which also allowed them to make more profits. This increase in profits helped the Kansas City Monarchs continue to be one of the most stable franchises in the Negro Leagues.

==Barnstorming, Negro American League==
Following the death of the original league, the Monarchs spent several years as an independent team, mostly barnstorming through the Midwest, West, and western Canada. They frequently toured with the House of David baseball team. Hall of Famers Hilton Smith, a pitcher, and Willard Brown, a slugging shortstop/outfielder with a consistent batting average of over .300, became Monarch mainstays during this time. During the 1940s, Willard Brown became the go-to home run hitter for the Monarchs. With Andy Cooper now at the helm, the Monarchs became charter members of the Negro American League (NAL) in 1937, winning the first league title. Andy Cooper was responsible for leading the Monarchs to bring home the pennant in 1939 and 1940. The Kansas City Monarchs then won the next two league championships and won winning the renewed Negro League World Series in 1942 in four straight games against the Homestead Grays.

At the start of this run the Monarchs acquired their most famous player, Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige, who had since his rookie season in 1927 built a reputation as the best hurler in black baseball for the Birmingham Black Barons, Pittsburgh Crawfords, and several other teams. Suffering from an arm injury and generally thought to be done, Paige joined the Monarchs&#x27; B team in 1939; by 1940 he had recovered and been called up to the Monarchs&#x27; main squad, where he became their top drawing card. Paige was the subject of a lot of stories, both true and folklore, and became a legend to people who don&#x27;t even follow baseball. For example, he was known to have known the outfielders to sit on the ground behind him while he struck out the hitter and there was someone on base that could possibly tie the game up. Paige also warmed up before pitching in a game by throwing across a gum wrapper as home plate. Paige led another superb Monarchs&#x27; staff that included fellow Hall of Famer Hilton Smith, the veteran Chet Brewer, Booker McDaniels, Jim LaMarque, and several others. They won one last NAL pennant in 1946, but lost a seven-game World Series to the Newark Eagles; in this series, they lost four games and won three.

In 1945, UCLA football star and Army lieutenant Jackie Robinson hit .387 as the Monarchs&#x27; shortstop. He became the first Monarch to make the jump to white baseball, signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946. He broke the minor league color line in 1946 with the Montreal Royals, and integrated the major leagues with the Dodgers in 1947. As baseball gradually desegregated in the late 1940s and 1950s, the Monarchs developed a niche as the foremost developer of black talent for the major leagues. The team sent more players to the majors than any other Negro league franchise, including Robinson, Paige, Ernie Banks, Elston Howard, Hank Thompson, and Willard Brown.

Newt Allen succeeded Cooper as manager in 1941, and was followed by Frank Duncan in 1942. Duncan stayed at the helm through the 1947 season winning two league titles and one world title. After Duncan stepped down, longtime first baseman Buck O&#x27;Neil took over. Then Monarchs lost the league title to the Birmingham Black Barons in 1948 which prevented them from appearing in the last Negro World Series. 1948 was also the year that Wilkinson sold the Monarchs to Tom Baird who owned the team through their minor league days in the 1950s. The Monarchs won the league&#x27;s western division first-half pennant in 1949, but declined to participate in a playoff with the Chicago American Giants, as their roster was depleted by player sales to major league clubs. They won the NAL West Division title in 1950 but did not meet the eastern champion Indianapolis Clowns that year. They won a half-season pennant in 1951 but lost a playoff. O&#x27;Neil won his only two league titles in 1953 and 1955, with a last-place finish sandwiched between in 1954 as the Negro American League of the 1950s declined in quality and shrank in size, while in the process grooming a number of eventual major league players.

== Home fields and move to Grand Rapids ==
The Monarchs played their home games in the minor league Kansas City Blues&#x27; Association Park from 1920 to 1923, and moved to the Blues&#x27; new park, Muehlebach Field, in mid-1923. They mostly barnstormed in the early-to-mid-1930s, but used Muehlebach (later known as Ruppert Stadium or Blues Stadium at different times) from 1937 until 1955. After a single season of scheduling games with the major league Kansas City Athletics as prime tenants of the renamed Municipal Stadium, Tom Baird sold eight players to major league clubs and four more players to minor league teams, released his manager, Buck O&#x27;Neil, who then signed on as a scout for the Chicago Cubs, and then sold the franchise to baseball entrepreneur Ted Rasberry, who moved its base to Grand Rapids, Michigan, though retaining the name &quot;Kansas City Monarchs&quot;. From 1956 on, the Monarchs were a full-time barnstorming team. The Negro American League ceased operations in 1962, and the Monarchs finally disbanded after the 1965 season. In Grand Rapids, the Monarchs Played at Valley Field, located at 700 Valley Ave NW, near where Sullivan Field is today.

== Minor league affiliate ==
The Kansas City Monarchs were one of a few Negro league teams that informally employed a farm team. The Monroe Monarchs played from the late 1920s to 1935, mostly as a minor league team loosely associated with Kansas City.

<text>North European Aerospace Test range (NEAT) in Sweden is Europe&#x27;s largest overland test range for aerospace systems.

It is a co-operation by the Swedish Space Corporation and Swedish Defence Materiel Administration.

Its aim is to provide facilities and services for safe aerospace testing in one of the few parts of Europe which has very low population and almost no air-traffic.

==Physical attributes==
NEAT consists of two ranges in northern Sweden, Esrange Space Center outside Kiruna and Vidsel Test Range, that are combined with a bridging area in-between the two ranges.

===Size===
The total size of NEAT is 24,000 km2, and the one-way length is 350 km.

===Restricted airspace===
NEAT has two permanently restricted airspace areas.
* R01 covers Esrange Space Center and is 6,600 km2, GND/UNL altitude.
* R02 covers Vidsel Test Range and is 7,200 km2, GND/UNL altitude.

There is also four additional restricted airspace areas over the bridging area that are only used when needed.
* Over the west part, GND/3500 MSL
* Over the west part, 3500 MSL/FL200
* Over the whole area, 3500 MSL/FL330 in the west part and FL200/FL330 in the east part.
* Over the whole area, FL470/UNL

===Suspended and restricted ground space===
====Restricted ground-space====
* Esrange Rocket Impact Area is 5,200 km2.

====Suspended ground-space====
* Vidsel Test Range is 3,300 km2.

<doc id="648096" wikidata="Q1159631" url="?curid=648096" title="Dangling else">
<text>The dangling else is a problem in programming of parser generators in which an optional else clause in an if–then(–else) statement can make nested conditional statements ambiguous. Formally, the reference context-free grammar of the language is ambiguous, meaning there is more than one correct parse tree.

In many programming languages, one may write conditionally executed code in two forms: the if-then form, or the if-then-else form. (The else clause is optional.):
 if a then s
 if b then s1 else s2

Ambiguous interpretation becomes possible when there are nested statements; specifically when an if-then-else form replaces the statement codice_1 inside the above if-then construct:

 if a then if b then s1 else s2
In this example, codice_2 gets executed if and only if codice_3 is true &quot;and&quot; codice_4 is true. But what about codice_5? One person might be sure that codice_5 gets executed whenever codice_3 is false (by attaching the &quot;else&quot; to the first &quot;if&quot;), while another person might be sure that codice_5 gets executed only when codice_3 is true &quot;and&quot; codice_4 is false (by attaching the &quot;else&quot; to the second &quot;if&quot;). In other words, someone could interpret the previous statement as being equivalent to either of the following unambiguous statements:
 if a then { if b then s1 } else s2
 if a then { if b then s1 else s2 }

The dangling-else problem dates back to ALGOL 60, and subsequent languages have resolved it in various ways. In LR parsers, the dangling else is the archetypal example of a shift-reduce conflict.

==Avoiding ambiguity while keeping the syntax==

This problem often comes up in compiler construction, especially scannerless parsing. The convention when dealing with the dangling else is to attach the else to the nearby if statement, allowing for unambiguous context-free grammars, in particular. Programming languages like Pascal, C, and Java follow this convention, so there is no ambiguity in the semantics of the &quot;language&quot;, though the use of a parser generator may lead to ambiguous &quot;grammars&quot;. In these cases alternative grouping is accomplished by explicit blocks, such as codice_11 in Pascal and codice_12 in C.

Depending on the compiler construction approach, one may take different corrective actions to avoid ambiguity:

*If the parser is produced by an SLR, LR(1), or LALR LR parser generator, the programmer will often rely on the generated parser feature of preferring shift over reduce whenever there is a conflict. Alternatively, the grammar can be rewritten to remove the conflict, at the expense of an increase in grammar size (see below).
*If the parser is hand-written, the programmer may use a &quot;non-ambiguous&quot; context-free grammar. Alternatively, one may rely on a non-context-free grammar or a parsing expression grammar.

==Avoiding ambiguity by changing the syntax==
The problem can also be solved by making explicit the link between an else and its if, within the syntax. This usually helps avoid human errors.

Possible solutions are:
* Having an &quot;end if&quot; symbol delimiting the end of the if construct. Examples of such languages are ALGOL 68, Ada, Eiffel, PL/SQL, Visual Basic, Modula-2, and AppleScript.
* Disallowing the statement following a &quot;then&quot; to be an &quot;if&quot; itself (it may however be a pair of statement brackets containing only an if-then-clause). ALGOL 60 follows this approach.
* Requiring braces (parentheses) when an &quot;else&quot; follows an &quot;if&quot;.
* Requiring every &quot;if&quot; to be paired with an &quot;else&quot;. To avoid a similar problem concerning semantics rather than syntax, Racket deviates from Scheme by considering an codice_13 without a fallback clause to be an error, effectively distinguishing conditional &quot;expressions&quot; (i.e codice_13) from conditional &quot;statements&quot; (i.e codice_15 and codice_16, which do not have fallback clauses).
* Using different keywords for the one-alternative and two-alternative &quot;if&quot; statements. S-algol uses codice_17 for the one-alternative case and codice_18 for the general case.
* Requiring braces unconditionally, like Swift. This is effectively true in Python as its indentation rules delimit every block, not just those in &quot;if&quot; statements.

==Examples==
Concrete examples follow.

===C===
In C, the grammar reads, in part:
Thus, without further rules, the statement

if (a) if (b) s; else s2;

could ambiguously be parsed as if it were either:

if (a)
 if (b)
 s;
 else
 s2;

or:

if (a)
 if (b)
 s;
else
 s2;

The C standard clarifies that an codice_19 block is associated with the nearest codice_13. Therefore, the first tree is chosen.

==Avoiding the conflict in LR parsers==
The above example could be rewritten in the following way to remove the ambiguity :
Any other statement-related grammar rules may also have to be duplicated in this way if they may directly or indirectly end with a codice_21 or codice_22 non-terminal.

However, we give grammar that includes both of if and while statements.

Finally, we give the grammar that forbids ambiguous IF statements.

With this grammar the statement codice_23 can only be parsed one way, because the other interpretation (codice_24) is produced as

and then the parsing fails trying to match codice_25 to &quot;if (b) c&quot;. An attempt with codice_25 fails in the same way. The other parse, codice_27) succeeds:

<doc id="648098" wikidata="Q709742" url="?curid=648098" title="Arthur Hay, 9th Marquess of Tweeddale">
<text>Colonel Arthur Hay, 9th Marquess of Tweeddale, (9 November 1824 – 29 December 1878), known before 1862 as Lord Arthur Hay and between 1862 and 1876 as Viscount Walden, was a Scottish soldier and ornithologist.

==Life==

Lord Arthur Hay was born at Yester House near Gifford, East Lothian, the son of General Sir George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale and his wife, Lady Susan Montague. He was sent to university in both Leipzig and Geneva.

Training in the military he received a commission in the British Army in 1841. He rose to be a Colonel in the Grenadier Guards. He served as a soldier in India and the Crimea. He succeeded his father in the Marquessate in 1876. 

Hay purchased a lieutenancy in the Grenadier Guards in 1841. He purchased a captaincy in 1846 and was promoted lieutenant-colonel without purchase in 1854 and Colonel in 1860. In 1866 he transferred to the 17th Lancers.

He was president of the Zoological Society of London from 16 January 1868. He had a private collection of birds, insects, reptiles and mammals and employed Carl Bock to travel to Maritime Southeast Asia and collect specimens. Tweeddale described about 40 species collected by Bock for the first time and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1871. The holotype specimen of the Critically Endangered and enigmatic Malabar Civet was obtained by him and gave it to Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1845.

His ornithological works were published privately in 1881 by his nephew, Captain Robert George Wardlaw-Ramsay, with a memoir by Dr W. H. Russell, and the attribution Walden is used in taxonomic listings.

Lord Tweeddale died at Walden Cottage in Chislehurst, London on 28 December 1878. As he had no issue, he was succeeded as Marquess of Tweeddale by his brother, William.

==Family==

He married twice: firstly in 1857 to Helene Kilmansegge (d.1871) and secondly in 1873 to Julia Mackenzie of Seaforth, daughter of Lt.-Colonel Keith William Stewart-Mackenzie (9 May 1818 – June 1881) and of Hannah Charlotte Hope Vere. After Hay&#x27;s death she married secondly Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet; and thirdly after his death William Evans-Gordon, MP. (All without issue).

<text>The Newark Eagles were a professional Negro league baseball team which played in the Negro National League from 1936 to 1948. They were owned by Abe and Effa Manley.

==History==
=== Formation ===
The Newark Eagles were formed in 1936 when the Newark Dodgers, established in 1933, merged with the Brooklyn Eagles, established in 1935. Abe Manley and his wife Effa Manley, owners and founders of the Brooklyn Eagles, purchased the Newark Dodgers franchise and combined the teams&#x27; assets and player rosters. Charles Tyler, the previous owner of the Dodgers, signed the team over in exchange for cancellation of an approximately $500 debt that Tyler owed Abe Manley.

Team management was left to Effa, making the Eagles the third professional baseball team owned and operated by a woman. The first such team was the St. Louis Cardinals, which was owned by Helene Hathaway Britton from 1911 to 1917, and the second such team was the Indianapolis ABCs who were owned by Olivia Taylor from 1922 to 1926. The Eagles shared Ruppert Stadium with the minor league Newark Bears.

=== Decline and demise ===
After the close of the 1948 season, in the aftermath of Jackie Robinson&#x27;s successful integration of Major League Baseball a year earlier, the Negro National League contracted and merged into the Negro American League. The Eagles were sold and moved to Houston, Texas for the 1949 season, where they became known as the Houston Eagles, part of the NAL&#x27;s western division. Two years later they again relocated, this time to New Orleans. The New Orleans Eagles lasted one year before folding after the 1951 season.

== Negro World Series champions ==
Under Effa Manley&#x27;s guidance, the 1946 team won the Negro World Series, upsetting the Kansas City Monarchs in a 7-game series.

<doc id="648102" wikidata="Q1411795" url="?curid=648102" title="Caulk">
<text>Caulk (also known as caulking and calking) is a material used to seal joints or seams against leakage in various structures and piping.

The oldest form of caulk consisted of fibrous materials driven into the wedge-shaped seams between boards on wooden boats or ships. Cast iron sewerage pipes were formerly caulked in a similar way. Riveted seams in ships and boilers were formerly sealed by hammering the metal.

Modern caulking compounds are flexible sealing compounds used to close up gaps in buildings and other structures against water, air, dust, insects, or as a component in firestopping. In the tunneling industry, caulking is the sealing of joints in segmental precast concrete tunnels, commonly by using concrete.

==Historical uses==

===Wooden shipbuilding===
Traditional caulking (also spelled calking) on wooden vessels uses fibers of cotton and oakum (hemp) soaked in pine tar. These fibers are driven into the wedge-shaped seam between planks, with a caulking mallet and a broad chisel-like tool called a caulking iron. The caulking is then covered over with a putty, in the case of hull seams, or else in deck seams with melted pine pitch, in a process referred to as paying, or &quot;calefaction&quot; (cf Dutch &quot;kalefateren&quot;). Those who carried out this work were known as caulkers. In the Hebrew Bible, the prophet Ezekiel refers to the caulking of ships as a specialist skill.

===Iron or steel shipbuilding===
In riveted steel or iron ship construction, caulking was a process of rendering seams watertight by driving a thick, blunt chisel-like tool into the plating adjacent to the seam. This had the effect of displacing the metal into a close fit with the adjoining piece.

===Boilermaking===
Caulking of iron and steel, of the same type described above for ship&#x27;s hulls, was also used by boilermakers in the era of riveted boilers to make the joints watertight and steamtight.

==Modern use in construction==

===Application===
For bulk use, caulk is generally distributed in disposable cartridges, which are rigid cylindrical cardboard or plastic tubes with an applicator tip at one end, and a movable plunger at the far end. These are used in caulking guns, which typically have a trigger connected to a rod which pushes the plunger, and has a ratchet to prevent backlash. The push rod may also be actuated by a motor or by compressed air. Similar mechanisms are used for grease guns.

For smaller applications, caulk may be distributed in squeeze tubes.

====Backer rod====
Backer rod, also called backer material or back-up rod, is a flexible foam product used behind caulking to increase elasticity, reduce consumption, force the caulking into contact with the sides of the joint creating a better bond, determine the thickness of the caulking, and define the cross-section hour-glass shape of the caulk. The backer rod also acts as a bond breaker to keep the caulking from sticking to the bottom of the opening—called a three-sided bond—with the caulk only adhering to the sides of the opening in an hour-glass shape it can flex more easily and is less likely to tear. Backer rods can also be used to reduce consumption of the caulking by filling part of the joints.

Closed-cell foam does not absorb water and is impermeable. Closed-cell rods are less compressible and should not be compressed more than 25%. Closed-cell rod will also lose firmness and out-gas if damaged during installation or overcompressed or at sharp bends. The gasses cannot pass through this backer rod and can deform, weaken, and even cause holes (leaks) in the caulk or sealant as it escapes.

Out-gassing is the reason that open-cell backer rod was developed. Open-cell foam is porous so it will let gasses through which could otherwise cause blistering of the caulk or sealant. Additionally, open-cell backer rod allows air to get to the back side of the caulk or sealant which accelerates curing when used with air-cured sealants such as silicone. Open-cell rod is more compressible than closed-cell foam and should be compressed 25% to 75%.

===Energy efficiency===
According to the Consumer Federation of America, sealing unwanted leaks around homes is an excellent way to cut home energy costs and decrease the household carbon footprint.

Also, sealing cracks and crevices around homes lessens the strain on home appliances and can save time, money and hassle by preventing major repairs.

===Preventing infestation===
Sealing cracks and crevices prevents ingress by rodents.

==Types==

===Acrylic latex===
The most common type of caulk is acrylic latex, for general-purpose use. Not only is acrylic latex inexpensive, but it is also the easiest type to apply smoothly and later paint if needed.

===Acrylic tile sealant===
Acrylic tile sealant usually comes in small tubes and is commonly used for wet applications.

===Polyurethane===
Polyurethane caulk is very durable and professional grade.

===Silicone===

Silicone caulk or sealant is water-, mold-, and mildew-resistant. Technically, when a joint material is silicone-based, it is considered a &quot;sealant&quot; rather than caulk.

<text> (, Sesame Street in English) is a German children&#x27;s television series that airs primarily in Germany and the surrounding German-speaking countries. It is a spin-off of the first preschool programme &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The show has been running on Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) since 1973, premiering on 8 January in that year. is also shown on the children&#x27;s channel, KiKa. It is made for children between the ages of three and seven.

==History==
===The Dubbed Era: 1973-onwards===
After a short test run of a few original, undubbed &quot;Sesame Street&quot; episodes, from August 1972 onward, the German version of the show premiered on 8 January 1973. The first three seasons, or 250 episodes of consisted of the original American episodes dubbed into German in Hamburg. Initially, only the opening and closing songs and sequences were changed, with new lyrics written by Volker Ludwig and tunes by Ingfried Hoffmann. The title of the German theme song is &quot;Der, die, das (wer, wie, was – wieso, weshalb, warum – wer nicht fragt, bleibt dumm!),&quot; almost literally translating to &quot;this, this and that (who, how, what – why, why and why – those who don&#x27;t ask stay dumb!).&quot;

In Bavaria, Bayerischer Rundfunk felt that the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; set was too gritty to suit German children, and consequently developed its own children&#x27;s programme called &quot;Das feuerrote Spielmobil&quot; (&quot;The fire-red Play-mobile&quot;). Variety shows like &quot;Peter Alexander präsentiert Spezialitäten&quot; in 1975 promoted the show by visiting the original United States set and taping special footage. From 1976 through 1977, the street scenes were dropped, partly as the result of a constant onslaught by protesting parents who were unhappy with the &quot;controversial&quot; character of Oscar the Grouch. Instead, a new framing story was created, following the antics of a boy named Bumfidel and his mother. Since these stories did not take place on a street, the show&#x27;s title was temporarily rendered incomprehensible.

===The Co-production Era: 1977-onwards===

In 1977, a German street set was built at Studio Hamburg for German framing stories. Samson, a bear (1978–2009, and since 2013) and Tiffy the bird (1978–2005) replaced Big Bird (Bibo) and Oscar the Grouch (Oskar der Griesgram) as main characters, and the new version debuted on January 2, 1978. The early puppets were built by Kermit Love, but nowadays, Sesame Workshop builds the puppets for Sesamstraße. Each 30-minute episode featured the new puppets interacting with a pair of human characters; consistently one male, one female. The individual sketches of Sesame Street&#x27;s original American inhabitants were dubbed over, and remained the main part of the show, but some were edited to omit intros that displayed words in English (such as The Adventures of Super Grover or the Sesame Street News Flash skits).

In the following years, more characters were added to the German street scenes, such as the German-built, androgynous Uli von Bödefeld (Uli is short for Ulrich), also called Herr von Bödefeld (1978–1988), and Finchen, a snail (1983, 1989–present). Just as in its American counterpart, the German characters have been remodeled over the decades. Most obvious were changes in Samson and Tiffy; Finchen has also had her fair share of fabric surgery.

During this era, the fact that the street stories took place in a studio was never kept a secret. Some parts of the street were simply &#x27;matted in&#x27; during an episode, or the characters would ask for help from the studio crew; one episode about Samson trying to scratch a flea ends with the entire studio crew itching. The matting also allowed the characters to show up in different locations, like a beach, a small deserted island that would be surrounded by an entire ocean through the snap of one&#x27;s fingers, a nearby train station, or the roof of the studio.

While Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, both performed by Caroll Spinney, had visited for the 10th Anniversary special before, a highlight of this era was the celebration of &#x27;s 1000th episode, the &quot;Sesamelly Zirkusshow.&quot; It was a circus gala performance taped at &quot;Zirkus Althoff,&quot; in which Big Bird appeared alongside the German characters one more time.

In 1985 and 1986, no new episodes were taped. Instead, a wild mix of repeats was shown on TV. From 1986 onward, new episodes with two new human actors were produced, and while the studio set remained largely the same, a bicycle shop was added, run by the new residents. Tiffy and Samson were slightly remodeled for the first time for these episodes.

In 1988, the studio set and original puppets were destroyed in a fire. The puppets were rebuilt in 1989 with significant changes. The new set was centered around the new bicycle shop that was introduced in 1986, but the street stories no longer took place in a studio set. Instead, a courtyard was added, and new characters were introduced: Rumpel the Grouch (1989–2009), living inside a water barrel, and Buh (1989–2002), an owl housed inside a hollow tree. While the set offered Tiffy a new apartment-like living room in the coming years, it still featured Samson&#x27;s cave in which he had lived prior to the set change. Uli von Bödefield was removed from the show due to the creators of not wishing to pay licensing fees. Later in the 1990s, the courtyard slowly transitioned into an entire marketplace, a common social center for German towns and even city districts.

Leonie Löwenherz (Leonie Lionheart in English), a lioness (1989-early 1990s), was featured for a very short time after the set and puppets were destroyed in the fire. Just like Uli von Bödefeld, she was built by German puppet makers and not the Muppet Workshop. After her short-lived Sesame career, she got her own ALF-like show called &quot;Leonie Löwenherz&quot; on ARD, featuring herself, her two lion brothers, and a few human characters. During this time period, older puppets were re-used for new characters such as Simson (on and off in 1989–2000), Samson&#x27;s cousin, with slight changes being made to his appearance (equipped with a hat, a tie, or another article of clothing). Originally, Simson was only imagined by Samson and other characters doubted his existence, much like Big Bird and Mr. Snuffleupagus in the United States.

In 2000, the cast was expanded further, and the sets changed once again. Newcomers to the puppet cast were Feli Filu (2000–2007), the monster reporter, the comic duo Pferd the horse (2002–present) and Wolle the sheep (2002–present), as well as a few recurring grouches, and some Anything Muppets. In 2005, after a 27-year presence on the show, Tiffy was replaced with single mom Moni (2005–2007) and her pink and furry daughter Lena (2005–2009). Since then, has been visited by a more diverse cast of supporting Muppets than any other international version of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. One-shot characters include Super Franky, Grouchella, Knut Köffelström, Turbo Theo, as well as various wolves, dogs, and other creatures. In 2006, German audiences&#x27; long-time favorites Bert and Ernie began appearing regularly in newly produced German segments. For the 36th season, the two moved into their own apartment on , above a new human character named Frau Kowalski. The pair were often shown commenting on the street events from their balcony. As more and more previously used Muppets were borrowed from Sesame Workshop, more secondary characters evolved in their own sketches, such as the green Wolf vom Wörtersee in 2007.

In 2003, the German co-production&#x27;s 30th anniversary was celebrated with a press conference and Axel Schulz, Ernie, Bert and Elmo (performed by Kevin Clash) in attendance, as the show gave a donation of €12,271.00 to UNICEF. Ernie and Bert appeared on a regular episode that year, as well as on the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary TV special.

Originally, an average episode used to consist of around 50 percent of American material, like most international co-productions of Sesame Street. From 2007 onwards, the American material has been used less often, so that eventually, an average episode contains no more than one or two American-produced sketches. In addition, much as on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; since 2002, &#x27;s street scenes began to feature mostly at the beginning of each episode. Since 2008, the show has been shot in high definition. On 24 December 2008, a German-produced, 45-minute Christmas special called &quot;Weihnachten mit Ernie und Bert&quot; aired, featuring Ernie, Bert, and an Anything Muppet Santa Claus. In 2011, more segments were produced to air both as standalone segments outside the show, and within: &quot;Ernie &amp; Bert Songs&quot; and &quot;Ernie &amp; Bert Märchensongs&quot;. From 2010 to 2012, the street stories were all repeats from previous episodes, although other new content was still being produced.

Since 2009 the program has been produced solely by NDR.

The show&#x27;s 40th anniversary, on 1 October 2012, saw the introduction of new character Elmo: a resident of the street, who appeared in a treehouse setting as the new host of the show. New characters included a female friend of Elmo&#x27;s, played by Julia Stinshoff, and Susi Schraube, an inventive girl appearing in a series of stop-motion segments. Established characters such as Rumpel and Samson were retired (although Samson made special appearances on the show in 2013 and 2014), while Pferd, Wolle, and Finchen remain part of the cast. Established characters such as Cookie Monster and Grover made guest appearances. Super Grover 2.0 was also added to the show beginning in 2013.

==Characters==
The main character is Samson, a large brown bear who replaced Big Bird. Like Big Bird, Samson is a full-body muppet and is the main character. Samson likes to dance the mambo. &quot;Feli Filu&quot; is a reporter for the show, and has interviewed a number of German celebrities, including president Horst Köhler. Samson the bear and Tiffy the bird/monster replaced the main character Big Bird (Bibo) in 1978.

Other characters added later were Uli von Bödefeld, also called Herr von Bödefeld (1978–1988), Finchen the Snail (1980s), Rumpel the Grouch (1989; a German relative of Oscar the Grouch), and Buh the Owl (1989). Newer additions are Feli Filu the Monster reporter, the comic duo Pferd the Horse, and Wolle the sheep, a few grouches (including Grouchella and an Übergrouch) and some Anything Muppets.

Germany&#x27;s Grouch character is called Rumpel. He hates rain when others love it, but loves rain when others complain about it. He lives in a rain barrel. His best friend is his pet caterpillar, Gustav. Little Bird has made some cameo appearances.

Bert and Ernie are among the most popular characters on &quot;Sesamstraße&quot;. In Germany, they were dubbed by:
* Ernie: Gerd Duwner (1973–1996), in the years 1997–2001 by Peter Kirchberger, and finally in 2001 by Michael Habeck.
* Bert: Wolfgang Kieling (1973–1985). From 1986, after Kieling&#x27;s death Horst Schön took over synchronization, followed by other speakers as Rolf Julich and Christian Rode. Since 2007, both of Martin Paas (Ernie) and Carsten Morar, Haffke (Bert) played, talked and synchronized.

===Leonie Löwenherz===
Leonie Löwenherz (Leonie Lionheart in English), a female lion, was featured for a very short time after the set and puppets were destroyed in a fire. Just like Uli von Bödefeld, she was most likely built by German Fabula Filmpuppen Workshop, and not the Sesame Workshop. After her short-lived Sesame career, she got her own (ALF-like) show called &quot;Leonie Löwenherz&quot; on ARD, featuring herself, her two lion brothers, and a few human characters.

* Finchen, a (former male, now female) snail (on and off from 1978, 1989–present)

==Theme song==
The theme song for is &quot;Der, die, das&quot;, whose melody and lyrics have little resemblance to the English version on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. &quot;Der, die&quot; and &quot;das&quot; are nominative definite articles in German (so the song&#x27;s title is &quot;The, the, the&quot;). In October 2012, this song was performed by the German Eurovision Song Contest winner Lena Meyer-Landrut who is accompanied by Elmo on the trumpet.

<text>Managerial finance is the branch of finance that concerns itself with the financial aspects of managerial decisions. 
Finance addresses the ways in which organizations (and individuals) raise and allocate monetary resources over time, taking into account the risks entailed in their projects;
Managerial finance, then, emphasizes the managerial application of these finance techniques and theories. 
The techniques assessed (and developed) are drawn in the main from managerial accounting and corporate finance; 
the former allow management to better understand, and hence act on, financial information relating to profitability and performance; 
the latter are about optimizing the overall financial-structure;
see .

In both cases, the discipline addresses these from the Managerial perspectives of Planning, Directing, and Controlling;
here in the more specific context of strategic planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of the organization&#x27;s financial undertakings.

Academics working in this area are typically based in business school finance departments, in accounting, or in management science. 

==Managerial accounting techniques==
Management accounting techniques are applied in the preparation and presentation of financial and other decision oriented information &quot;in such a way as to assist management in the formulation of policies and in the planning and control of the operation undertaking&quot;. 
The analytics here are thus concerned with forward-looking decisions, as opposed to the historical and compliance perspective of financial accounting.

Undertaking these tasks, financial managers use various management accounting and financial analysis techniques to accurately assess the results and performance of the business lines and units, and to monitor resource allocation within the organization; 
this includes
profitability analysis and cost analytics 
– employing techniques such as activity based costing, whole-life cost analysis, cost–volume–profit analysis, and variance analysis – 
as well budget analytics more generally.
(See also cash flow forecast and financial forecast.)

==Corporate finance techniques==

Managerial finance is, as above, also focused on the overall financial-structure of the business, including its realized impact on cash flow and profitability. It is thus interested in long-term revenue / business optimization, while also minimizing the potential impact of any financial shocks on short term performance. To accomplish these goals, managerial finance addresses techniques utilized in Corporate finance, usually organized re the following:
* Working capital management - addressing short term current assets and current liabilities and optimizing cash flow
* Capital budgeting, i.e. selection / valuation and funding of &quot;projects&quot; – addressing long term investments 
* Capital structure and dividend policy – addressing long-term financial capital and attempting to optimize the balance sheet.
The discipline also considers the various applications of risk management here.

<text>Nikolai Alekseyevich Severtsov (; 5 November 1827 – 7 February 1885) was a Russian explorer and naturalist. He was among the early promoters of Darwinian ideas in Russia.

== Life and work ==
Severtsov was born in Khvoshchevatovo, Zemlyansky district, Voronezh, where his father Aleksey Petrovich was a retired guard officer who had served in the Patriotic War of 1812, losing an arm in the Battle of Borodino. He had become interested in natural history after reading Buffon&#x27;s work as a child and going out on hunts. and studied at the Moscow University where he was influenced by Karl Rouillier who considered what Haeckel called as ecology as &quot;general zoology&quot;. His master&#x27;s dissertation was on the seasonal life of animals in Voronezh province. At the age of eighteen he came into contact with Grigory Karelin and took an interest in central Asia. In 1855 he applied for an associate professor position but failed to be appointed. In 1857, he joined a mission to Syr-Darya. On the expedition to the Syr Darya, he was captured by Kokand people near Fort Perovsky and freed only after a month. He was posted under the Ural Cossack Army from 1860 to 1862. In 1864 he served in the Kokand campaign under M.G. Chernyaev and was involved in topographic surveys. He made scientific studies, collecting nearly 12 thousand specimens during this period and received an honorary doctoral degree. In 1865–68, he explored the Tian Shan mountains and Issyk-Kul lake. In 1877–78, he explored the Pamir Mountains, following a route close to the current Pamir Highway as far as Lake Yashil Kul on the Ghunt River.

Severtsov wrote with great reluctance according to his student Menzbier. One of his works was the &quot;Vertical and Horizontal Distribution of Turkestan Wildlife&quot; (1873), which included the first description of a number of animals. Among them is a subspecies of argali (wild sheep) later named after him: &quot;Ovis ammon severtzovi&quot;. He also described many new species and subspecies of birds. The spotted great rosefinch, &quot;Carpodacus rubicilla severtzovi&quot;, is among those named after him.

Severtsov wrote on the geographical variations of birds, which was termed by him as &quot;zoological ethnography&quot;. This work attracted Darwin&#x27;s interest. In 1875 Severtsov visited Darwin in England. Severtsov began to assemble a collection of birds in the estate of Petrovskoe. On 7 February 1885, he was returning home in a carriage along the frozen Ikorts river that feeds into the Don. The carriage broke the ice and plunged. While everyone extricated themselves and attempted to find a warm place nearby, he delayed by searching for his portfolio and collapsed. His driver froze to death.

The Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow is named after his son Alexei Severtsov (1866-1936).

<text>Gert-Jan Prins (born 1961, IJmuiden) is a Dutch musician active in free improvisation.

Initially a free jazz percussionist, Prins now focuses on producing and manipulating sound, especially white and pink noise, using a collection of custom-built FM radio transmitters and receivers, similar to the instruments of American composer David Tudor.

Prins is a member of M.I.M.E.O., a twelve-piece electronic orchestra led by Keith Rowe (formerly of the British free-improvisation trio AMM). He has groups with synthesizer players Thomas Lehn and Thomas Ankersmit, pianist Cor Fuhler and composer and reed player Peter van Bergen.

<doc id="648127" wikidata="Q19584" url="?curid=648127" title="Crawley Town F.C.">
<text>Crawley Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Crawley, West Sussex, England. The team competes in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system in the 2024–25 season following promotion.

Founded in 1896 as Crawley Football Club, helped to found the West Sussex League later that year before transferring to the Mid-Sussex League. The club disbanded in 1935, but were re-established in the Brighton, Hove &amp; District League three years later. The club switched to the Sussex County League in 1951 and then moved on to the Metropolitan League five years later. In 1958, the club changed its name to Crawley Town Football Club. The club moved from amateur to semi-professional status in 1962 and were accepted into the Southern League the following year. They secured promotion out of Division One in 1968–69, only to suffer relegation the next season.

Crawley were promoted out of the Southern League Southern Section 1983–84 and spent the next 21 seasons in the Premier Division, before winning promotion into the Conference as champions of the Southern League in 2003–04. The club turned fully professional in 2005 but faced immediate financial difficulties and entered administration the following year. The club survived and appointed Steve Evans as a manager in May 2007. Evans led them into the Football League as champions of the Conference in 2010–11 and then secured promotion in their first season in League Two. Crawley spent three seasons in League One before relegation in 2015. After nine seasons in League Two, Crawley won the League Two play-offs in 2024 to earn promotion back to League One. The club has played home games at Broadfield Stadium since 1997 and are nicknamed the &quot;Reds&quot; or &quot;Town&quot; due to the colour of their kit.

==History==
===Early years===
Having played friendly matches from 1890, with the club&#x27;s first match played on 22 November 1890 at home to Lingfield, Crawley Town were formed in 1896, and became founding members of the West Sussex Football League that year, joining the Junior Division. They remained in the West Sussex league for five years before transferring to the Mid-Sussex League, winning the League in only their second season. After disbanding at the end of the 1934–35 season, the club reformed in 1938 and joined Division Two of the Brighton, Hove &amp; District League. They played in the Sussex County Emergency League in 1945–45, before returning to the Brighton, Hove &amp; District League in 1946–47, becoming members of Division One.

They stayed at this level until they entered the Sussex County League in 1951 before switching again five years later to the Metropolitan League, which was a competition for both professional and amateur sides. In 1958, Crawley changed their name to Crawley Town. Town retained their amateur status and went on to win the Metropolitan League Challenge Cup in 1959.

Crawley turned semi-professional in 1962 and the following year they joined Division One of the Southern League. In 1969 they were promoted to Premier Division of the Southern League but the joy was short-lived as the following season they were relegated back to the first division where they remained until the 1983–84 season when they were promoted as runners-up.

Crawley&#x27;s most successful cup run at the time was in the 1991–92 season when they reached the FA Cup third round proper and played local Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, losing 5–0 in front of 18,301 at the Goldstone Ground.

In 1999, the club entered administration with debts estimated to be around £400,000. In October 1999, the club was bought by John Duly after a period of two months in administration, with Billy Smith appointed as manager. At the time, the Reds were second-bottom, but the club went on to finish in 12th place, six points above the relegation zone, at the end of this season various players from the first and reserve teams were released to try and free up finances, including John Sawyer, Jason Davy, Daniel Cullingham, Alex Barber and Jimmy Drew who all were part of a promising reserve team at the time finishing runner-up in the reserve league to Crystal Palace reserves. Whilst the 2000–01 season saw Town finish 11th, Crawley were much improved in a 2001–02 campaign which saw them finish fourth. This season saw the return of some of the previously released players as the administrators had now found new owners. Whilst Crawley finished seventh in 2002–03, the Reds found success in the 2003–04 season, when they ended their 20-season stay in the Premier Division of the Southern League by winning the division with 84 points, 12 points clear of second-placed Weymouth, and winning the Southern League Cup for the second successive season. The title was secured with four matches remaining with a 3–0 victory at Welling United, sparking celebrations from a large travelling contingent. Crawley would now be playing in the Football Conference, the highest level of non-League football, for the first time in their history.

===Conference===
A final position of 12th in their first season in the National Division was considered an impressive achievement for the club who finished as the highest-ranked part-time team in the country. Crawley also retained the Sussex Senior Cup by defeating Ringmer.

In 2005, the SA Group bought the club and made the decision to go full-time for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Although this was necessary in order to allow them to compete in the division, it led to the departure of several key players, including fans&#x27; favourite Charlie MacDonald and goalkeeper Andy Little, who were unable to give up their day jobs to play full-time.

The 2005–06 season didn&#x27;t start well for Crawley as the club found themselves third from bottom and out of the FA Cup after a shock defeat to Braintree Town. Francis Vines was subsequently sacked and replaced by former Chelsea FC manager and player John Hollins and his assistant Alan Lewer. Things got worse for Crawley and as attendances dropped, and so too did the club&#x27;s income; the club&#x27;s owners were forced to slash the players&#x27; and staff wages by 50% due to lack of funds. Several key players left the club, including captain Ian Simpemba, Simon Wormull and record signing Daryl Clare; it looked certain that relegation was on the cards. However five straight wins through March and April saw the club climb the table to 17th place and beat the drop by 10 points. The club was docked three points at the end of the season for breaching the annual playing budget but this had no effect on the final standings and Crawley&#x27;s league status was safe. However, they later went into administration, with insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor placed in control of the club.

===Financial problems===
Although Crawley Town F.C. had been in administration in the late 1990s, trouble began in March 2006 when the club&#x27;s players and staff were made to take a 50% pay cut and the entire squad was put up for sale; Crawley went into administration in June of that year. It was revealed by local newspaper the Argus several days later that the chairman Chas Majeed was an undischarged bankrupt and therefore banned from holding a high position within the club. Majeed later resigned from his post but remained involved.

The fans started a &quot;Red Card&quot; campaign in order to remove Chas Majeed and his brother Azwar Majeed (Crawley Town&#x27;s owner) from the club, with fans waving red cards at the Majeeds and forming a supporters&#x27; trust. It was revealed that the club was around £1.1million in debt with nearly £400,000 due to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and the Majeeds claimed they were owed £700,000 by the club. By July of that year, the debts were closer to £1.4 million, including money owed to current and former staff, and an offer of 25p in the pound was rejected by the creditors. With HMRC unwilling to move on its demand and being the biggest creditor (the Majeeds were unable to vote on the matter despite being owed money), it looked unlikely that the club would be saved.

By August 2006, only one bid had come in for the club which was from the current owners; it was rejected by three to one; the administrators were therefore obliged to liquidate the club and it was announced that the club would fold later that day. However, a couple of days later, in one final attempt to rescue the club, the creditors met again to decide on a final offer. The creditors were split and so the administrator voted in Crawley Town&#x27;s favour, allowing them to start the new season. The creditors would meet 14 days later to decide on an offer of 50p in the pound. The club was told that if the offer was rejected then the club would fold there and then, and there would be no going back. By September 2006 the club&#x27;s debt was at £1.8 million making former/current players and staff the biggest creditors and giving hope that a rescue bid would be accepted. The offer of 50p in the pound was later accepted and Crawley Town was able to continue playing for the time being, though this didn&#x27;t stop HMRC from trying to wind up the SAGroup (Majeed&#x27;s company) over unpaid taxes. Azwar Majeed was later jailed for tax fraud relating to his various other businesses.

Crawley started the 2006–07 season by winning their opening three games and all but wiped out their 10-point deduction. The following month, however, the club&#x27;s form dipped and this led to John Hollins and Alan Lewer losing their jobs. The news did not go down well with the fans as the pair had stuck with Crawley when others decided to leave and they had managed to lift the club off the bottom despite a 10-point deduction. They were replaced by players Ben Judge and David Woozley with the help of John Yems, the former Fulham FC and Millwall FC coach. Life started well for the trio who picked up 10 points from a possible 12. Crawley finished 18th in the division and managed to beat the drop after securing the point they needed on the final day of the season.

In May 2007, it was confirmed that all of Crawley Town&#x27;s debts had been cleared. However, complications arose and as a result Crawley were given a six-point penalty for the new season and a transfer embargo was put in place because of financial irregularities. It is believed that Crawley failed to confirm to the league that the debts had been paid. For the start of the 2007–08 season, a new regime was put into place which included Victor Marley as club Chairman and Steve Evans as manager, with Paul Raynor as an assistant. Crawley finished the season in a respectable 15th place, and were runners-up in the Sussex Senior Cup, despite the club&#x27;s financial position and points deduction.

In April 2008 Prospect Estate Holdings Limited took control of Crawley after buying it from the SA Group in conjunction with former owner John Duly. The club&#x27;s financial worries were over and the club could look to build again and start the 2008–09 season on a level playing field.

After a short period of stability, Crawley Town ended up in the High Court in London to face a winding-up order on 17 February 2010; again this was because of money being owed to HMRC. The hearing was adjourned until 17 March 2010. The latest setback appeared to be the end of Crawley Town, as the club had very few assets to sell in order to satisfy the debt. However, the case was later dismissed by the High Court as the club proved the debt had been paid.

In a move that showed confidence in the new management, on 29 March 2010 Crawley Borough Council agreed to lease the Broadfield Stadium to Crawley Town F.C. and to help secure the long-term sustainability of the club.

===FA Cup run and Football League===
In 2010, Bruce Winfield announced that he and Susan Carter had become majority shareholders and had attracted new investment for the club, some of which came from overseas. The investment allowed manager Steve Evans to start rebuilding the squad, which saw 23 players signed over a six-month period including Matt Tubbs, for £70,000, Sergio Torres for a record £100,000, and Richard Brodie for an undisclosed fee, which was estimated to be a new Conference record of £275,000.

The investment paid off as Crawley were challenging for promotion to the Football League and embarked on a remarkable FA Cup run. Victories over Newport County, Guiseley and Swindon Town saw the club progress to a third round tie at home to Championship side Derby County. They won 2–1, and followed it up with a 1–0 win at League Two side Torquay United in the fourth round. The fifth round draw saw Crawley face away tie with then Premier League leaders Manchester United, with manager Steve Evans admitting it was &#x27;the tie of his dreams&#x27;. Crawley lost the fifth round tie 1–0 in front of 9,000 Crawley fans, though were denied a draw when Richard Brodie&#x27;s header hit the bar in the 93rd minute.

In March 2011, club owner Bruce Winfield died from cancer, aged 61. Despite their cup run and Winfield&#x27;s death, Crawley didn&#x27;t halt their progress in the league as just 19 days after Winfield&#x27;s death, Crawley secured the 2010–11 Football Conference title by beating Tamworth 3–0 and reaching the Football League for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

In the 2011–12 season, they once again enjoyed success in the FA Cup, beating Championship clubs Bristol City and Hull City both 1–0 home and away respectively. They suffered a 2–0 defeat against Stoke City in the fifth round. This was Crawley&#x27;s first match against Premier League opposition at the Broadfield Stadium.

Crawley finished 2011 at the top of League Two; a positive start to their first campaign in league football. However, despite continued success in the FA Cup, form slipped. Between 17 December 2011, and 13 March 2012, Crawley won just two league games out of a possible 14. Many argued the sales of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett for £800,000 and £1,100,000 respectively, as well as failing to reach a deal over Andy Drury contributed to their dip in form. Three Crawley players were involved in a post-match brawl against Bradford City, including former club captain Pablo Mills (suspended for six matches) and fellow defender Claude Davis (suspended for four matches). Five players from both clubs were suspended in total equalling the record for the most dismissals in an English game. Consequently, Crawley were fined £18,000. Following an FA inquiry into the events that took place, Kyle McFadzean was handed a four-game suspension after being found guilty of violent conduct. All three players released apology statements, and were all fined two weeks&#x27; wages. Despite apologising, Mills was stripped of his captaincy for behaviour not befitting the role of a club captain. He was released by the club at the conclusion of the 2011/12 season.

On 9 April, it was announced that Steve Evans had left Crawley to take up a post at Rotherham United. Evans revealed &quot;In my opinion, how far can I take Crawley Town? League One certainly, but beyond that I was not so sure&quot;. Evans had previously admitted frustration over the departures of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett. Assistant manager Paul Raynor also left the club with immediate effect, with coach Craig Brewster taking over as manager for the remainder of the season. Steve Coppell was appointed as director of football with immediate effect.

On Saturday 5 May Crawley secured League One promotion, courtesy of a 67th minute Scott Neilson strike against Accrington Stanley.

It was announced on 12 May, that Crawley were in talks to appoint Sean O&#x27;Driscoll as their new manager. Under a tight budget at Doncaster Rovers he achieved promotion to the Football League Championship in his first full season. He was appointed as manager four days later. Despite Crawley chief executive Alan Williams being convinced they had made &#x27;the perfect appointment&#x27;, he left on 12 July, to become the new manager of Nottingham Forest, meaning that he did not take charge of Crawley for a single game.

On 7 August 2012, Crawley appointed Bury F.C. manager Richie Barker as their new manager. Under him, the club had a successful debut season in League One, challenging for the play-offs for much of the campaign and finishing comfortably in tenth place. The club caused controversy, however, by banning a reporter from &quot;Crawley News&quot; because the club&#x27;s management disliked two of his paper&#x27;s headlines. The club were condemned for this in a motion signed by 23 MPs on 10 December 2013. Barker was sacked early in the following season for speaking to League Two side Portsmouth about their manager&#x27;s job. He was replaced by John Gregory, who steered the club to another mid-table finish despite a poor late run.

The 2014–15 season saw Crawley struggle for form, and Gregory resigned for health reasons near the end of 2014, with the club in the relegation zone. Dean Saunders was appointed to replace him on an interim basis, and despite an upturn in form, was unable to get the club out of trouble. On Sunday 3 May 2015, Crawley were relegated to League Two, following a 1–2 defeat at home to Coventry City. Saunders&#x27; short-term deal was not renewed after the season ended, and he was replaced by Mark Yates.

===Return to League Two===

While Crawley were among the pre-season promotion favourites, one win in their first 10 games quickly put paid to any such hopes. Their form improved as the season progressed, and they were 12th by 26 December. In March 2016, the club was purchased by Turkish businessman Ziya Eren, who set a target for the club to be playing in the Championship within 8–10 years. Following a run of six consecutive defeats, Yates was sacked just before the season ended, with Dermot Drummy appointed as his successor.

The 2016–17 season started strongly for the Reds. However, after drawing 3–3 at home to Carlisle United thanks to captain Jimmy Smith&#x27;s late goal, Crawley only narrowly survived in League Two. On 4 May, the club sacked Drummy after a year in charge. On 27 November 2017, Drummy was found dead near the A414 in Hoddesdon, with the cause of death later confirmed to be suicide.

On 23 May 2017, former Leeds United winger Harry Kewell was appointed as head coach. Kewell led Crawley to a 14th-placed finish - their best finish since relegation from League One. Kewell left the club shortly into the 2018–19 season, to manage fellow League Two club Notts County. Gabriele Cioffi was appointed as his successor a week later and led the club to finish 19th that season.

Despite the club reaching the fourth round of the EFL Cup in the 2019–20 season, their best performance in the competition, manager Gabriele Cioffi left the club by mutual consent on 2 December 2019, with the club having won just once in 11 matches leaving the club 17th in League Two. Cioffi was replaced by former manager John Yems three days later on a deal until the end of the season. Following an upturn in the club&#x27;s form, with Crawley losing just two of 11 matches, Yems&#x27; contract was extended until the end of the 2022–23 season in late January 2020. However, in March 2020, the League Two season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Crawley still to play a further nine games. The season was later terminated, with Crawley finishing 13th after clubs agreed to base the final table on points per game. The following season, Crawley improved one place to 12th. In the FA Cup, they reached the fourth round of the FA Cup after beating Premier League Leeds United 3–0.

===WAGMI United===
On 7 April 2022, it was announced that the club had been acquired by Wagmi United LLC, a group of US cryptocurrency investors. The &quot;crypto bro&quot; new owners promised a new approach to football club ownership, talking of building a &quot;tight-knit community&quot; of fans &quot;stretching from West Sussex to anywhere in the world with an internet connection&quot;, but they quickly encountered controversy. Manager John Yems left the club in May 2022 after allegations of racist behaviour and was later banned from football until January 2026 after being found guilty of 12 charges of racist abuse towards his players. He was replaced by Kevin Betsy. After a disastrous start to the 2022–23 league season, Betsy left the club on 9 October 2022 following a 3–0 defeat to Grimsby Town which left the club bottom of the league. The reign of the next manager was even shorter; Matthew Etherington resigned in December 2022 after just 34 days in charge. Amid what &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;reckless leadership&quot; and a &quot;shambles&quot;, caretaker manager Darren Byfield was joined in the dugout at the 3–1 defeat to Stevenage by co-chairman Preston Johnson, who was ridiculed online by Stevenage staff for his lack of understanding of substitution rules. After Crawley fans requested a meeting with the owners, Johnson delayed, saying the club needed to get to &quot;the bottom of sensitive legal issues&quot;. Scott Lindsey was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager on 11 January 2023. A vital 2–0 win at direct rivals Hartlepool United all but secured survival, confirmed the following week after a 0–0 draw at home to Walsall in the penultimate match of the season. The following campaign saw Crawley Town finish 7th, reaching the play-offs for the first time, where they thrashed MK Dons 8–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals, an EFL record. 

In their first visit to Wembley, Crawley Town defeated Crewe Alexandra 2−0 in the League Two play-off final and were promoted to League One. On 30 May 2024, Preston Johnson announced he was standing down as co-chairman but would remain a co-owner. In the following transfer window 8 out of the 11 starters from the play-off final would depart the club. On 23 September, Scott Lindsey would join MK Dons, to be replaced by Rob Elliot.

==Stadium==
Crawley Town FC spent 48 years at their Town Mead home until the land was sold to developers in 1997. The club then moved to the Broadfield Stadium, about two miles across town. The stadium has a capacity of 5,996 people, and is owned by Crawley Borough Council.

In January 2012 the application for the new 2,000-seater East Stand and facilities including new turnstiles and Premier League standard floodlights was accepted by Crawley Borough Council. The upgrade was required to meet the league rules which require a minimum 5,000 capacity stadium. After just one week of construction, the new East Stand was completed on 2 April 2012, bringing the total capacity of the Broadfield Stadium to 5,500. Upon completion, Crawley&#x27;s first game with the new stand was against League Two side Crewe Alexandra on 6 April. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, with a new record crowd of 4,723, the previous best being 4,522.

The record attendance reached 5,880 on 5 January 2013 when Crawley Town hosted Reading in the FA Cup.

Between 2013 and 2018, the stadium was called The Checkatrade.com Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal with the online trades comparison company Checkatrade.

==Rivalries==
Crawley Town supporters view AFC Wimbledon as their biggest rivals, according to a 2012 survey, with Swindon Town seen as their second The AFC Wimbledon rivalry is partly due to their close geographical proximity.

The teams last met in April 2024, with play-off chasing Crawley scoring a 90th minute equaliser to all but confirm Sutton’s relegation to the National League.

<doc id="648131" wikidata="Q4748473" url="?curid=648131" title="Ampleforth College">
<text>Ampleforth College is a co-educational fee-charging boarding and day school in the English public school tradition. It opened in 1803 as a boys&#x27; school. It is near the village of Ampleforth, North Yorkshire, England, on the grounds of Benedictine monastery Ampleforth Abbey. The school is in a valley with sports pitches, wooded areas, and lakes. The school has the oldest purpose-built school theatre in the United Kingdom, a dedicated student pub, and its own infirmary. It has received national attention for significant safeguarding failures.

St Laurence Educational Trust and the Ampleforth Abbey Trust are responsible for running Ampleforth College. Boarding fees were £46,740 for the school year 2024/2025.

==History==

The college began as a small school for 70 boys founded by Benedictine monks, at Ampleforth Abbey, in 1803. 

The Abbey and school were built upon Anne Fairfax&#x27;s generous donation of land. Fairfax herself had attended the Bar Convent School in York, now known as All Saints. This connection has fostered a lasting partnership between the two schools.

The school formally constituted as a Catholic boarding school in 1900. Various buildings were slowly added, including the school theatre which was built in 1909. The first performances took place in 1910, and in 1922 a cinema projector was acquired, but could not be used until the following year when electric lighting and central heating were installed.

The first boarding houses were founded in 1926 to accommodate the growing pupil numbers. In 1929, the Abbey gained ownership of Gilling Castle and opened a preparatory school. Gilling Castle Prep merged with the college&#x27;s junior school in 1992 before taking on its current name St Martin&#x27;s Ampleforth after absorbing another nearby prep school.

In 1998, girls were admitted for the first time when the sixth form became coeducational. The first girls&#x27; boarding house, St Aidan&#x27;s, was opened in 2001, followed by St. Margaret&#x27;s in 2004 to extend coeducation to the Year 9 intake. The college is now fully coeducational.

Since the Catholic emancipation, Ampleforth gained a reputation as one of several schools, alongside Downside School, The Oratory School and Stonyhurst, popular within the Catholic aristocracy and labelled the &quot;Catholic Eton&quot;; it has been noted, however, that falling academic standards have seen many Catholics turn away from the school.

=== College tramway ===

In 1895, the North Eastern Railway built a gauge tramway from Gilling station on the Thirsk to Malton Line. The tram was horse-drawn, and provided coal for the college to produce gas. It also transported passengers in open wagons. The tramway closed in 1923 when the college changed to electric lighting.

==Education==

The school says that its primary concern is to provide pupils with not just academic, sporting and other achievements, but also &quot;a spiritual compass for life&quot;: moral principles to give guidance in a secular world; within a context where the &quot;Benedictine ethos permeates pupils&#x27; experience&quot;.

The &quot;Good Schools Guide&quot; called the school an &quot;Unfailingly civilised and understanding top co-educational boarding Catholic school that has suffered from time to time as a result of its long liberal tradition.&quot; The &quot;Guide&quot; adds also that there is &quot;A refreshing openness and honesty about the place these days.&quot;

Its academic admissions policy is not as exacting as that exercised by some other English public schools. The school is typically between 150-200 in the annual league tables of public examination results, although it was ranked 6th nationally in the 2004 &quot;value added&quot; table. It maintains a scholarship set, with about 5% of pupils gaining the offer of a place at Oxford or Cambridge. More than 90% go on to university.

In 2018 the school failed an inspection by the Independent Schools Inspectorate regarding boarding provision, and the school was issued with a formal notice requiring the school to produce an Action Plan to resolve the failings. The Charity Commission had earlier removed pupil safeguarding responsibilities from the school&#x27;s trustees, and the headmaster had been suspended from the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference over safeguarding concerns.

In May 2019, the Department of Education performed an unannounced inspection, with poor results. In July 2019 it was reported that the school&#x27;s acting head was stepping down after 10 months in the job.
However, in spring 2019 the school passed a compliance inspection under a new head.

Following a September 2020 report, still unpublished as of November 2020, the Secretary of State for Education, Gavin Williamson, wrote to the college ordering them to stop admitting new pupils over safeguarding failures; the college said that it intended to appeal. The ban was lifted the following April.

==School life==
Though originally a boys&#x27; school the college is now fully co-educational. In 2009 an OFSTED Social Care report said that the overall quality of care was outstanding; in 2013 it was deemed &quot;excellent&quot;.

==Houses==

The school is arranged into ten houses, with pupils living in separate house buildings, eating together as a house for lunch 6 days a week, and playing sport in inter-house competitions. Each house is named after a British saint. Boys houses are St Cuthbert&#x27;s, St Dunstan&#x27;s, St Edward-Wilfrid&#x27;s (as of September 2018 became Junior House) which were originally two separate houses, St Hugh&#x27;s, St John&#x27;s, St Oswald&#x27;s, and St Thomas&#x27;s, and girls, St Aidan&#x27;s, St Bede&#x27;s and St Margaret&#x27;s.

Some houses are paired into buildings named after people who have been instrumental in the school&#x27;s history. Hume House building, named after Cardinal Basil Hume, combines St Cuthbert and St Edward-Wilfrid houses. Nevill House building combines St Dunstan and St Oswald houses. Bolton House building was formerly St Edward and St Wilfrid houses before their merger in 2001. Fairfax House building combines St Margaret and St Hugh houses.

==Controversy==

===Fee-fixing===

In September 2005, Ampleforth was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools which were found by the Office of Fair Trading to be operating a fee-fixing cartel in breach of the Competition Act of 1998. All of the schools were ordered to abandon this practice, pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 each (with minor exceptions) and make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. Mrs Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that they were unaware that the law had changed, and that private schools had not known that they had become subject to competition law.

===Safeguarding===
Initially several monks and three members of the lay teaching staff were accused of molesting children in their care over a period of several decades. In 2005, Father Piers Grant-Ferris admitted 20 incidents of child abuse. The &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; reported in 2005: &quot;Pupils at a leading Roman Catholic school suffered decades of abuse from at least six paedophiles following a decision by former Abbot Basil Hume [later a cardinal, and Archbishop of Westminster] not to call in police at the beginning of the scandal.&quot; Following the case, the Abbot, Fr Cuthbert Madden, offered a &quot;heartfelt apology&quot; to the victims of one member of staff.

The College thereafter established a safeguarding policy, later judged inadequate (see below), but which was said to follow the local inter-agency procedures of the North Yorkshire Safeguarding Children Board and the guidance given in the Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations 2010 and the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools. In accordance with this policy, in 2016 Fr Madden temporarily stepped down from his role of Chairman of Governors during the investigation of indecent assault allegations made by four former pupils. Based on the evidence available no further police action was taken, however the English Benedictine Congregation refused to allow him to resume his role.

In April 2018, the Charity Commission appointed a lawyer to take charge of safeguarding at Ampleforth College, as it was not satisfied that the trustees of the charities that run the college had made enough progress in improving pupil safeguarding.

The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) investigated the English Benedictine Congregation, including Ampleforth College and Downside School, amongst other institutions, and published a report in August 2018. Ten individuals from the two schools, including monks, were convicted or accepted a caution for abuse. The report said that abuse was inflicted on pupils over 40 years, but the schools tried to cover up allegations. The Chair of the Inquiry, Prof. Alexis Jay, said that the schools for decades tried to avoid giving any information to police or authorities, with monks being &quot;secretive, evasive and suspicious of anyone outside the English Benedictine Congregation&quot;, prioritising &quot;the reputation of the Church and the wellbeing of the abusive monks&quot; over safeguarding. New procedures were introduced in 2001 following the Nolan Report, recommending that abuse should be referred to the statutory authorities, however allegations continued to be handled internally.

The Department for Education released a report in November 2020 following an inspection, claiming that the school in some respects appeared to have relapsed in the year since the change of leadership. The school was forbidden from admitting new pupils. The school responded that it had taken &quot;very considerable steps forward&quot; and put in place &quot;a robust safeguarding regime, a new senior leadership team, and a new governance structure that has effectively separated the abbey from the college&quot;, and said that it intended to appeal the decision. The admissions ban, due to come in place on 29 December, was delayed. In his first interview on the matter, headmaster Robin Dyer stated in December 2020 that there was &quot;no evidence expressed in the report&quot; of any instances &quot;to do with emergencies [or] to do with harm to children&quot;. Arguing that the Ofsted report was &quot;less than complete&quot; and had little to do with his tenure as headmaster, he requested that a new inspection be conducted in January. Following a further Ofsted inspection, in April 2021 the admissions ban was lifted by the Secretary of State for Education, Gavin Williamson. Inspectors reported that they were satisfied with Ampleforth&#x27;s progress, and the Department for Education signed off on the school&#x27;s safeguarding action plan.

An Ofsted report, following an inspection at the end of 2021, found that the school did not meet independent school standards or national minimum standards for boarding schools in several areas. They rated the school &quot;Inadequate&quot; for &quot;Overall experiences and progress of children and young people&quot;, specifically those with special educational needs and/or disabilities; &quot;How well children and young people are helped and protected&quot;; and &quot;The effectiveness of leaders and managers&quot;; although rated the quality of education as &quot;Good&quot;. The school disputed these findings as unsubstantiated or factually inaccurate, citing evidence, including quotes from a police report, that were inconsistent with Ofsted&#x27;s findings. The school also referenced multiple independent audits which contradicted the report, and two Ofsted surveys which found 100% of parents felt their child was safe and happy, and 99.6% of students felt safe. Local MP Kevin Hollinrake stated that &quot;I want to make clear that I am supportive of the school in this situation, and I feel that there is a fundamental dispute of the facts behind the assessment, that needs to be resolved&quot;.

The Charity Commission reported in 2024 that its inquiry had found many &quot;serious abuse allegations&quot; of offences committed against pupils by monks and staff over the preceding decade, with &quot;significant weaknesses&quot; in the safeguarding, governance and management of the two trusts running the college. A 2023 Ofsted inspection rated the college as &quot;good&quot;.

<doc id="648133" wikidata="Q5154139" url="?curid=648133" title="Communication in small groups">
<text>Communication in small groups consists of three or more people who share a common goal and communicate collectively to achieve it. During small group communication, interdependent participants analyze data, evaluate the nature of the problem(s), decide and provide a possible solution or procedure. Additionally, small group communication provides strong feedback, unique contributions to the group as well as a critical thinking analysis and self-disclosure from each member. Small groups communicate through an interpersonal exchange process of information, feelings and active listening in both two types of small groups: primary groups and secondary groups.

== Group communication ==
The first important research study of small group communication was performed in front of a live studio audience in Hollywood California by social psychologist Robert Bales and published in a series of books and articles in the early and mid 1950s . This research entailed the content analysis of discussions within groups making decisions about &quot;human relations&quot; problems (i.e., vignettes about relationship difficulties within families or organizations). Bales made a series of important discoveries. First, group discussion tends to shift back and forth relatively quickly between the discussion of the group task and discussion relevant to the relationship among the members. He believed that this shifting was the product of an implicit attempt to balance the demands of task completion and group cohesion, under the presumption that conflict generated during task discussion causes stress among members, which must be released through positive relational talk. Second, task group discussion shifts from an emphasis on opinion exchange, through an attentiveness to values underlying the decision, to making the decision. This implication that group discussion goes through the same series of stages in the same order for any decision-making group is known as the &quot;linear phase model&quot;. Third, the most talkative member of a group tends to make between 40 and 50 percent of the comments and the second most talkative member between 25 and 30, no matter the size of the group. As a consequence, large groups tend to be dominated by one or two members to the detriment of the others.

===Linear phase model===
The most influential of these discoveries has been the latter; the linear phase model. The idea that all groups performing a given type of task go through the same series of stages in the same order was replicated through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; with most finding four phases of discussion. For example, communication researcher B. Aubrey Fisher showed groups going sequentially through an orientation stage, a conflict stage, a stage in which a decision emerges and a stage in which that decision is reinforced. Much of this research (although not necessarily Fisher&#x27;s) had two fundamental flaws. First, all group data was combined before analysis, making it impossible to determine whether there were differences among groups in their sequence of discussion. Second, group discussion content was compared across the same number of stages as the researcher hypothesized, such that if the researcher believed there were four stages to discussion, there was no way to find out if there actually were five or more. In the 1980s, communication researcher Marshall Scott Poole examined a sample of groups without making these errors and noted substantial differences among them in the number and order of stages. He hypothesized that groups finding themselves in some difficulty due to task complexity, an unclear leadership structure or poor cohesion act as if they feel the need to conduct a &quot;complete&quot; discussion and thus are more likely to pass through all stages as the linear phase model implies, whereas groups feeling confident due to task simplicity, a clear leadership structure and cohesion are more likely to skip stages apparently deemed unnecessary.

===Idea development===
Another milestone in the study of group discussion content was early 1960s work by communication researchers Thomas Scheidel and Laura Crowell regarding the process by which groups examine individual proposed solutions to their problem. They concluded that after a proposal is made, groups discuss it in an implied attempt to determine their &quot;comfort level&quot; with it and then drop it in lieu of a different proposal. In a procedure akin to the survival of the fittest, proposals viewed favorably would emerge later in discussion, whereas those viewed unfavorably would not; the authors referred to this process as &quot;spiraling.&quot; Although there are serious methodological problems with this work, other studies have led to similar conclusions. For example, in the 1970s, social psychologist L. Richard Hoffman noted that odds of a proposal&#x27;s acceptance is strongly associated with the arithmetical difference between the number of utterances supporting versus rejecting that proposal. More recent work has shown that groups differ substantially in the extent to which they spiral. Additional developments have taken place within group communication theory as researchers move away from conducting research on zero-history groups, and toward a &quot;bona fide&quot; groups perspective. The bona fide group, as described by Linda L. Putnam and Cynthia Stohl in 1990, fosters a sense of interdependence among the members of the group, along with specific boundaries that have been agreed upon by members over time. This provides researchers with model of group behavior that stays true to the characteristics displayed by most naturally occurring groups, (s).

== Social influence in groups ==
Work relevant to social influence in groups has a long history. Two early examples of social psychological research have been particularly influential. The first of these was by Muzafer Sherif in 1935 using the autokinetic effect. Sherif asked participants to voice their judgments of light movement in the presence of others and noted that these judgments tended to converge. The second of these was a series of studies by Solomon Asch, in which naive participants were asked to voice their judgments of the similarity of the length of lines after hearing the &quot;judgments&quot; of several confederates (research assistants posing as participants) who purposely voiced the same obviously wrong judgment. On about 1/3 of the cases, participants voiced the obviously wrong judgment. When asked why, many of these participants reported that they had originally made the correct judgment but after hearing the confederates, decided the judgments of several others (the confederates) should be trusted over theirs. As a consequence of these and other studies, social psychologists have come to distinguish between two types of social influence; informational and normative (see conformity). Informational influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the content of what they read or hear to accept an opinion; Sherif&#x27;s study appears to be an example. Normative influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the knowledge that a majority of group members have a view. Normative influence should not be confused with compliance, which occurs when group members are not persuaded but voice the opinions of the group majority. Although some of the participants in the Asch studies who conformed admitted that they had complied, the ones mentioned above who believed the majority to be correct are best considered to have been persuaded through normative influence.

=== Culture ===
Culture affects the entire communication of a person. Within small groups there are three specific factors that affect communication. The first factor covers whether a person prioritizes their needs as more or less important than the group&#x27;s necessities. The second important factor is power distance, the degree at which people accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. In high-power distance cultures, an individual of low power would not disagree with an individual with more power than him. On the contrary, in low-power distance cultures everyone&#x27;s input and opinions are taking into account in certain decisions. The third factor that affects communication in small groups is uncertainty avoidance. The degree of tolerance people have for risk. In high uncertainty cultures individuals expect and prefer rules and structurized systems. In those low uncertainty avoidance cultures, individuals prefer and are comfortable with constant change and scarce rules. 

===Conflict resolution===
Any group has conflicts, topics that people do not agree on, different points of view on how to move forward with a task and so on. As a result, to be able to overcome any conflict that might arise, a six step conflict resolution will help to overcome the problem.
* All the group members have to listen carefully to each other
* Understand the different points of view that were discussed
* Be respectful and show interest in maintaining a good relationship with the group members regardless of their opinions
* Try to find a common ground
* Come up with new solutions to the problem or situation
* Finally, reach on a fair agreement that will benefit everyone

===Group decisions===

During a small group decision the process can be more open, vulnerable and can rely on several decision techniques. A common process that small groups incorporate in decision making situations starts by a orientation where each member starts to familiarize or socialize with other members. Secondly, small group members face conflict, where each person shares ideas or possible solutions to a problem. This session is also known as brainstorming. During the conflict stage, subgroups or stronger personalities can emerge. Then, small group members advance to a consensus, where after evaluating several ideas the group agrees to advance. Lastly is closure, where small group team members agree completely on an idea and start taking action.

By the end of the 1950s, studies such as Sherif&#x27;s led to the reasonable conclusion that social influence in groups leads group members to converge on the average judgment of the individual members. As a consequence, it was a surprise to many social psychologists when in the early 1960s, evidence appeared that group decisions often became more extreme than the average of the individual predisposed judgment. This was originally thought to be a tendency for groups to be riskier than their members would be alone (the risky shift), but later found to be a tendency for extremity in any direction based on which way the members individually tended to lean before discussion (group polarization). Research has clearly demonstrated that group polarization is primarily a product of persuasion not compliance. Two theoretical explanations for group polarization have come to predominate. One is based on social comparison theory, claiming that members look to one another for the &quot;socially correct&quot; side of the issue and if they find themselves deviant in this regard, shift their opinion toward the extreme of the socially correct position. This would be an example of normative influence. The other &#x27;persuasive arguments theory&#x27; (PAT), begins with the notion that each group member enters discussion aware of a set of items of information favoring both sides of the issue but lean toward that side that boasts the greater amount of information. Some of these items are shared among the members (all are aware of them), others are unshared (only one member is aware of each). Assuming most or all group members lean in the same direction, during discussion, items of unshared information supporting that direction are voiced, giving members previously unaware of them more reason to lean in that direction. PAT is an example of informational influence. Although PAT has strong empirical support, it would imply that unshared items of information on the opposite side of the favored position would also come up in discussion, canceling the tendency to polarize. Research has shown that when group members all lean in one direction, discussion content is biased toward the side favored by the group, inconsistent with PAT. This finding is consistent with social comparison notions; upon discovering where the group stands, members only voice items of information on the socially correct side. It follows that an explanation for group polarization must include information influence and normative influence.

The possibility exists that the majority of information known to all group members combined, supports one side of an issue but that the majority of information known to each member individually, supports the other side of the issue. For example, imagine that each member of a 4-person group was aware of 3 items of information supporting job candidate A that were only known to that member and 6 items of information supporting job candidate B that were known to all members. There would be 12 items of information supporting candidate A and 6 supporting candidate B but each member would be aware of more information supporting B. Persuasive arguments theory implies that the items of information favoring A should also come up, leading to each member changing their mind but research has indicated that this does not occur. Rather, as predicted by the merging of PAT and social comparison theory, each member would come into discussion favoring B, that discussion would be heavily biased toward B and that the group would choose B for the job. This circumstance, first studied by Stasser and Titus, is known as a &quot;hidden profile&quot; and is more likely to occur as group size increases and as the proportion of shared versus unshared items of information increases.

Many methods may be used in reaching group decisions. The most popular method in Western culture is by majority, but other ways to make team decisions are available. Firstly, voting by majority brings quick decision making, and that is one of the reasons why it is the most widely used. A second method is by consensus. Reaching decisions by consensus is time consuming, but it allows everyone to bring forward their opinion. A third method is by averaging. This method requires all teammates to reach a decision by compromising. Reaching decisions by minority decision calls for a subcommittee getting together and reaching decisions without the whole groupe being involved. A final method is by authority rule. In this method, the group leader listens to individual group member&#x27;s ideas, and has final say on a decision.

=== Nonverbal communication ===

Body language is a form of nonverbal communication, consisting of body pose, gestures, eye movements and paralinguistic cues (i.e. tone of voice and rate of speech). Humans send and interpret such signals unconsciously.
It is often said that human communication consists of 93% body language and paralinguistic cues, while only 7% of communication consists of words themselves - however, Albert Mehrabian, the researcher whose 1960s work is the source of these statistics, has stated that this is a misunderstanding of the findings (see Misinterpretation of Mehrabian&#x27;s rule).

=== Physical expression ===

Physical expressions like waving, pointing, touching and slouching are all forms of nonverbal communication. The study of body movement and expression is known as kinesics. Humans move their bodies when communicating because as research has shown, it helps &quot;ease the mental effort when communication is difficult.&quot; Physical expressions reveal many things about the person using them for example, gestures can emphasize a point or relay a message, posture can reveal boredom or great interest, and touch can convey encouragement or caution.

=== Examples list ===

*&quot;Hands on knees&quot;: indicates readiness.
*&quot;Hands on hips&quot;: indicates impatience.
*&quot;Lock your hands behind your back&quot;: indicates self-control.
*&quot;Locked hands behind head&quot;: states confidence.
*&quot;Sitting with a leg over the arm of the chair&quot;: suggests indifference.
*&quot;Legs and feet pointed in a particular direction&quot;: the direction where more interest is felt
*&quot;Crossed arms&quot;: indicates submissiveness.

Body language is a form of non-verbal communication involving the use of stylized gestures, postures, and physiologic signs which act as cues to other people. Humans, sometimes unconsciously, send and receive non-verbal signals all the time.

== Body language and space ==

Interpersonal space refers to the psychological &quot;bubble&quot; that we can imagine exists when someone is standing far too close to us. Research has revealed that in North America there are four different zones of interpersonal space. The first zone is called intimate distance and ranges from touching to about eighteen inches apart. Intimate distance is the space around us that we reserve for lovers, children, as well as close family members and friends. The second zone is called personal distance and begins about an arm&#x27;s length away; starting around eighteen inches from our person and ending about four feet away. We use personal distance in conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions. The third zone of interpersonal space is called social distance and is the area that ranges from four to eight feet away from you. Social distance is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances. The fourth identified zone of space is public distance and includes anything more than eight feet away from you. This zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.

===Language difficulties===

Misunderstandings in communication are common because of the many different factor, that is the way of conveying message; which is done through language. Though there is no right or wrong way to communicate, avoiding language barriers such as jargon, bypassing, and offensive language may prevent misunderstandings in group or interpersonal discussions.
One of the more common barriers in communication is the inappropriate use of jargon. Jargon is a fictive language invented by and for the group as a verbal shorthand. It also syllabifies group membership when used properly. The problem with jargon is that it can make words confusing and can be used to conceal the truth.
Another barrier to language is bypassing. Bypassing occurs when group members have different meanings for different words and phrases and thus miss each other&#x27;s meanings. To overcome the risk of bypassing it is important to look to what the speaker wants and not always at what the speaker says. The third most common language barrier is offensive language. Offensive language is &quot;any terminology that demeans, excludes, or stereotypes people for any reason. Avoiding sexist, discriminating, or labeling talk will greatly reduce chances of miscommunication. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to communicate. Though language difficulties are common, avoiding barriers like jargon, bypassing, and offensive language, will greatly reduce your chances of being misunderstood. Only through habitual awareness can one begin to truly understand and then be understood.

== Sociology ==

Small groups can be the means by which social constraints are enforced, and can also act as an arena in which the constraints can be challenged. Small groups often contain and develop an idioculture, a set of shared meanings as well as negotiate status. Groups are able to provide rewards and punishment in line with societies expectations.

<text>A virtual environment is a networked application that allows a user to interact with both the computing environment and the work of other users. Email, chat, and web-based document sharing applications are all examples of virtual environments. Simply put, it is a networked common operating space. Once the fidelity of the virtual environment is such that it &quot;creates a psychological state in which the individual perceives himself or herself as existing within the virtual environment&quot; then the virtual environment (VE) has progressed into the realm of immersive virtual environments (IVEs).

== Types of Virtual Environments ==
Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs): These environments support real-time interaction between multiple users, often represented by avatars. Popular platforms include Second Life,Slack, and Zoom, which are used for collaboration in education and remote work. CVEs foster teamwork by simulating shared spaces for communication and resource sharing.

Immersive Virtual Environments (IVEs): IVEs use VR headsets and motion tracking to create highly realistic environments. IVEs are applied in fields such as healthcare for surgical training, in the military for simulation-based training, and in psychotherapy to treat anxiety disorders through virtual exposure therapy. Gaming and entertainment industries also heavily employ IVEs for fully immersive experiences.

Augmented Virtual Environments (AVEs): AVEs combine virtual reality (VR) with augmented reality (AR) elements, where users can see and interact with virtual objects superimposed on the real world. Devices such as Microsoft HoloLens and Google Glass are examples of AVEs, offering applications in industrial training, remote assistance, and collaborative design.

== Applications of Virtual Environments ==
Education: VEs are revolutionizing education through virtual classrooms and labs, allowing remote students to engage in interactive learning experiences. Platforms like Google Classroom, and Blackboard provide tools for resource sharing, assessments, and live interactions.

Virtual Meetings and Remote Work: VEs have transformed business operations, especially with the increased demand for remote work. Tools such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Cisco Webex enable virtual meetings, allowing real-time collaboration across geographical boundaries. These platforms incorporate features like screen sharing and document collaboration.

Training Simulations: VEs are critical in fields that require practical training in controlled environments. For example, flight simulators allow pilots to practice flight maneuvers in a safe virtual space, while medical professionals use virtual surgical simulators to improve their skills .

== Technological Components ==
3D Graphics: VEs rely on 3D graphics to create interactive, lifelike spaces. Engines like Unity and Unreal Engine are widely used to develop these environments, simulating physical attributes such as texture, depth, and lighting .

Networked Communication: Real-time communication and interaction between users depend on stable, high-speed networks. Peer-to-peer (P2P) and client-server architectures are commonly used to synchronize data between users in CVEs and IVEs .

Haptic Feedback: To enhance immersion, VEs often incorporate haptic feedback technology, which provides tactile responses to users interacting with virtual objects. This is particularly useful in IVEs where physical sensations can simulate real-world interactions.

==Future of Virtual Environments==
The next generation of virtual environments will likely see advancements in AI-driven avatars, full-body motion tracking, and enhanced haptic feedback. These innovations will further blur the line between physical and virtual spaces, offering more realistic and immersive experiences. VEs are expected to continue impacting fields such as healthcare, education, and entertainment, with widespread adoption of VR and AR technologies.

<doc id="648136" wikidata="Q364857" url="?curid=648136" title="Constantine Samuel Rafinesque">
<text>Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz (; 22 October 178318 September 1840) was a French early 19th-century polymath born near Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire and self-educated in France. He traveled as a young man in the United States, ultimately settling in Ohio in 1815, where he made notable contributions to botany, zoology, and the study of prehistoric earthworks in North America. He also contributed to the study of ancient Mesoamerican linguistics, in addition to work he had already completed in Europe.

Rafinesque was an eccentric and erratic genius. He was an autodidact, who excelled in various fields of knowledge, as a zoologist, botanist, writer and polyglot. He wrote prolifically on such diverse topics as anthropology, biology, geology, and linguistics, but was honored in none of these fields during his lifetime. Indeed, he was an outcast in the American scientific community and his submissions were automatically rejected by leading journals. Among his theories were that ancestors of Native Americans had migrated by the Bering Sea from Asia to North America, and that the Americas were populated by black indigenous peoples at the time of European contact.

==Biography==
Rafinesque was born on 22 October 1783, in Galata, a suburb of Constantinople. His father, F. G. Rafinesque, was a French merchant from Marseilles; his mother, M. Schmaltz, was of German descent and born in Constantinople. His father died in Philadelphia about 1793. Rafinesque spent his youth in Marseilles, and was mostly self-educated; he never attended university. By the age of 12, he had begun collecting plants for an herbarium. By 14, he had taught himself Greek and Latin because he needed to follow footnotes in the books he was reading in his paternal grandmother&#x27;s libraries. In 1802, at the age of 19, Rafinesque sailed to Philadelphia in the United States with his younger brother. They traveled through Pennsylvania and Delaware, where he made the acquaintance of most of the young nation&#x27;s few botanists.

In 1805, Rafinesque returned to Europe with his collection of botanical specimens, and settled in Palermo, Sicily, where he learned Italian. He became so successful in trade that he retired by age 25 and devoted his time entirely to natural history. For a time Rafinesque also worked as secretary to the American consul. During his stay in Sicily, he studied plants and fishes, naming many newly discovered species of each. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1808.

===Career in the United States===
Rafinesque had a common-law wife. After their son died in 1815, he left her and returned to the United States. When his ship &quot;Union&quot; foundered near the coast of Connecticut, he lost all his books (50 boxes) and all his specimens (including more than 60,000 shells). Settling in New York, Rafinesque became a founding member of the newly established Lyceum of Natural History. In 1817, his book &quot; or A Flora of the State of Louisiana&quot; was strongly criticized by fellow botanists, which caused his writings to be ignored. By 1818, he had collected and named more than 250 new species of plants and animals. Slowly, he was rebuilding his collection of objects from nature.

In the summer of 1818, in Henderson, Kentucky, Rafinesque made the acquaintance of fellow naturalist John James Audubon, and stayed in Audubon&#x27;s home for some three weeks. Audubon, although enjoying Rafinesque&#x27;s company, took revenge upon him (for an incident where Rafinesque damaged one of Audubon&#x27;s prized violins) by describing fantastic, made-up species, prompting Rafinesque to publish descriptions of them.

In 1819, Rafinesque became professor of botany at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where he also gave private lessons in French, Italian, and Spanish. He was loosely associated with John D. Clifford, a merchant who was also interested in the ancient earthworks that remained throughout the Ohio Valley. Clifford conducted archival research, seeking the origins of these mounds, and Rafinesque measured and mapped them. Some had already been lost to American development.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1820.

Rafinesque started recording all the new species of plants and animals he encountered in travels throughout the state. He was considered an erratic student of higher plants. In the spring of 1826, he left the university after quarreling with its president.

He traveled and lectured in various places, and endeavored to establish a magazine and a botanic garden, but without success. He moved to Philadelphia, a center of publishing and research, without employment. He published &quot;The Atlantic Journal and Friend of Knowledge, a Cyclopædic Journal and Review&quot;, of which only eight issues were printed (1832–1833). He also gave public lectures and continued publishing, mostly at his own expense.

===Death===
Rafinesque died of stomach and liver cancer in Philadelphia on 18 September 1840. The cancer may have been induced by Rafinesque&#x27;s self-medication years before with a mixture containing maidenhair fern. He was buried in a plot in what is now Ronaldson&#x27;s Cemetery. In March 1924, what were thought to be his remains were transported to Transylvania University and reinterred in a tomb under a stone inscribed, &quot;Honor to whom honor is overdue.&quot;

==Work==
===Biology===
Rafinesque published 6,700 binomial names of plants, many of which have priority over more familiar names. The quantity of new taxa he produced, both plants and animals, has made Rafinesque memorable or even notorious among biologists.
Rafinesque applied to join one of the western scientific expeditions organized by President Thomas Jefferson, but received notice of appointment to the Dunbar and Hunter Expedition only after his arrival in Sicily. After studying the specimens collected by the Lewis and Clark expedition, he assigned scientific names to the black-tailed prairie dog (&quot;Cynomys ludovicianus&quot;), the white-footed mouse (&quot;Peromyscus leucopus&quot;), and the mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;).

===Evolution===
Rafinesque was one of the first to use the term &quot;evolution&quot; in the context of biological speciation.

Rafinesque proposed a theory of evolution before Charles Darwin. In a letter in 1832, Rafinesque wrote:

The truth is that Species and perhaps Genera also, are forming in organized beings by gradual deviations of shapes, forms and organs, taking place in the lapse of time. There is a tendency to deviations and mutations through plants and animals by gradual steps at remote irregular periods. This is a part of the great universal law of perpetual mutability in everything. Thus it is needless to dispute and differ about new genera, species and varieties. Every variety is a deviation which becomes a species as soon as it is permanent by reproduction. Deviations in essential organs may thus gradually become new genera.

In the third edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a &quot;Historical Sketch&quot; that acknowledged the ideas of Rafinesque.

Rafinesque&#x27;s evolutionary theory appears in a two-page article in the 1833 spring issue of the &quot;Atlantic Journal and Friend of Knowledge&quot; (a journal founded by himself). Rafinesque held that species are not fixed; they gradually change through time. He used the term &quot;mutations&quot;. He believed that evolution had occurred &quot;by gradual steps at remote irregular periods.&quot; This has been compared to the concept of punctuated equilibrium. He also held that the same processes apply to humans.

===&quot;Walam Olum&quot;===
In 1836, Rafinesque published his first volume of &quot;The American Nations&quot;. This included &quot;Walam Olum&quot;, a purported migration and creation narrative of the Lenape (also known by English speakers as the Delaware Indians). It told of their migration to the lands around the Delaware River. Rafinesque claimed he had obtained wooden tablets engraved and painted with indigenous pictographs, together with a transcription in the Lenape language. Based on this, he produced an English translation of the tablets&#x27; contents. Rafinesque claimed the original tablets and transcription were later lost, leaving his notes and transcribed copy as the only record of evidence.

For over a century after Rafinesque&#x27;s publication, the &quot;Walam Olum&quot; was widely accepted by ethnohistorians as authentically Native American in origin, but as early as 1849, when the document was republished by Ephraim G. Squier, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an ethnologist who had worked extensively in Michigan and related territories, wrote to Squier saying that he believed the document might be fraudulent. In the 1950s, the Indiana Historical Society published a &quot;retranslation&quot; of the &quot;Walam Olum&quot;, as &quot;a worthy subject for students of aboriginal culture&quot;.

Since the late 20th century, studies especially in linguistic, ethnohistorical, archaeological, and textual analyses suggest that the &quot;Walam Olum&quot; account was largely or entirely a fabrication. Scholars have described its record of &quot;authentic Lenape traditional migration stories&quot; as spurious. After the publication in 1995 of David Oestreicher&#x27;s thesis, &quot;The Anatomy of the Walam Olum: A 19th Century Anthropological Hoax&quot;, many scholars concurred with his analysis. They concluded that Rafinesque had been either the perpetrator, or perhaps the victim, of a hoax. Other scholars, writers, and some among the Lenape continue to find the account plausible and support its authenticity.

===Study of prehistoric cultures===

Rafinesque made a notable contribution to North American prehistory with his studies of ancient earthworks of the Adena and Hopewell cultures, especially in the Ohio Valley. He was the first to identify these as the &quot;Ancient Monuments of America&quot;. He listed more than 500 such archaeological sites in Ohio and Kentucky. Rafinesque never excavated; rather, he recorded the sites visited by careful measurements, sketches, and written descriptions. Only a few of his descriptions were published, with his friend John D. Clifford&#x27;s series &quot;Indian Antiquities&quot;, eight long letters in Lexington&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Western Review and Miscellaneous Magazine&quot; (1819–1820). Clifford died suddenly in 1820, ending his contributions.

Rafinesque&#x27;s work was used by others. For instance, he identified 148 ancient earthworks sites in Kentucky. All sites in Kentucky that were included by E. G. Squier and Davis in their notable &quot;Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley&quot; (1848), completed for the Smithsonian Institution, were first identified by Rafinesque in his manuscripts.

Rafinesque also made contributions to Mesoamerican studies. The latter were based on linguistic data, which he extracted from printed sources, mostly those of travelers. He designated as &quot;Taino&quot;, the ancient language of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Others later also used the term to identify the ethnicity of indigenous Caribbean peoples.

Although mistaken in his presumption that the ancient Maya script was alphabetical in nature, Rafinesque was probably first to insist that studying modern Mayan languages could lead to deciphering the ancient script. In 1832, he was the first to partly decipher ancient Maya. He explained that its bar-and-dot symbols represent fives and ones, respectively.

===Legacy===
According to historian George Daniels, Rafinesque was a brilliant but erratic naturalist who roamed the American wilderness. His style was offputting to the emerging professionalization of science and achievements were controversial at the time and by historians ever since. By 1820, he was virtually an outcast in the scientific community as all the important publications rejected his submissions. The two leading American scientists of the day, Benjamin Silliman and Asa Gray, were harshly critical. Modern historians agree that Rafinesque was often hasty, and tried to claim credit properly due to other researchers. Scientists were troubled that his theory of evolution – long before Darwin – seemed to be based more on his speculation and exaggerations than on solid research. Despite all his faults, says Daniels, &quot;he made enormous contributions to the natural history phase of American science...with the establishment of 34 genera and 24 species of American fishes.&quot; He was also a brilliant teacher at Transylvania University. 
*In 1838, the white-spotted lantern fish was named &quot;Collettia rafinesquii&quot; in his honour by Anastasio Cocco; it has since been moved to &quot;Diaphus rafinesquii&quot;.
*In 1841, Thomas Nuttall named a new genus &quot;Rafinesquia&quot; after Rafinesque. He felt indebted to the naturalist, who had inspired his work and given Nuttall&#x27;s &quot;Flora&quot; a positive review. The genus now contains two species, &quot;Rafinesquia californica&quot; Nutt. (California plumeseed or California chicory) and &quot;Rafinesquia neomexicana&quot; A. Gray (desert chicory or plumeseed).
*In 1892, James Hall and J. M. Clarke proposed the genus name &quot;Rafinesquina&quot; in honor of Rafinesque for a number of fossil brachiopod species then belonging to genus &quot;Leptaena&quot;; the genus is now in the family Rafinesquinidae.
*In 1896, the fish genus &quot;Rafinesquiellus&quot; was named by Jordan &amp; Evermann, though it was subsequently synonymized under the genus &quot;Etheostoma&quot;.

<text>Peter Leopold von Schrenck (; 1826 – 8 January 1894) was a Russian zoologist, geographer and ethnographer.

==Biography==
Schrenck came from a Baltic German family, and was born and raised in the , Sumsky Uyezd, Kharkov Governorate. He received his doctorate from the Imperial University of Dorpat, and then studied natural science in Berlin and Königsberg. He joined the crew of the &quot;Aurora&quot; (Russian Imperial Navy frigate) in the circumnavigation of the world.

In 1853 Schrenck was sent by the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences to explore the Amurland on board the schooner &quot;Vostok&quot;. He reached the mouth of the Amur in September 1854 with the botanist Carl Maximowicz. In February 1855 he visited Sakhalin and then explored the Amur in the spring and summer. In 1856 he returned overland to Europe, via Lake Baykal. He published his findings in his &quot;Reisen und Forschungen im Amur-Lande in den Jahren 1854-56&quot;, in two quarto volumes, 1858–60, with more than 350 pages on birds. In later years Schrenck turned his attention to the study of the native peoples of Russia. On 10 November, 1879 he was appointed director of the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography in St Petersburg.

A number of animals are named after Schrenck, including the following species.
* Schrenck&#x27;s limpet, &quot;Notoacmea schrenckii&quot;
* Amur sturgeon, &quot;Acipenser shrenckii&quot;
* Manchurian black water snake, &quot;Elaphe schrenckii&quot; 
* Schrenck&#x27;s bittern, &quot;Ixobrychus eurhythmus&quot;
* A butterfly, &quot;Apatura schrenckii&quot;.

<text>Ulitsa Sezam (Russian: Улица Сезам) is the Russian production of the children&#x27;s television program Sesame Street. The show was first released in 1996 and went off the air in 2010.

==History==
In 1993 Sesame Workshop recruited Natasha Lance Rogoff to produce Ulitsa Sezam. It was funded by Russian advertising agency VideoArt and the U.S. Agency for International Development. A total of 279 Russians were recruited to help develop and produce the series, and the show&#x27;s budget totaled US$6 million. Production began in 1994.

The initial creation of this series proved difficult with a myriad of complications like cultural clashes with prospective native talent, many of whom were resistant to emulating the American style of puppetry created by Jim Henson. Instead, they proposed native puppetry material that the producers like Rogoff could not accept as they were too violent, frightening, or went against the educational curriculum of the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW).

Another problem involved different approaches to script writing. Some of the first scripts produced by the Russian team included &quot;lecturing, tough-talking adults,&quot; which CTW pushed back on. Other scripts tended towards fantasy or the idea of leaving the country. In response, CTW encouraged the script writers to &quot;create a childhood that they [envisioned] for a future generation of Russians&quot;, rather than to try and emulate their own childhoods.

Cultural clashes were also present during auditions; most of the children auditioning for the show &quot;sat back in their chairs and started to sing very sad songs,&quot; which startled the American producers.

There were other problems like the assassinations of some of the production&#x27;s local business partners, serious financial difficulties by the production&#x27;s major local producer, and a military raid on the studio in which vital materials were seized.

The series debuted on October 22, 1996, on TV channels NTV and ORT.
The show was nominated for a TEFI award in 1997, but lost to perennial favorite Good Night, Little Ones!.

=== Second season ===
The second season on &quot;optimism&quot; was filmed in 1999 and broadcast in 2000 on NTV and STS.

=== Third season ===
The third season began filming in September 2001 and was aired in November on STS.

The main theme of the third season was &quot;Diversity in the world&quot;. Several celebrities were guests on the show, including actors Leo Durov and Mary Aronov, composer Grigory Gladkov, and opera singer Vyacheslav Voynorovsky.

=== Fourth season ===
In 2006, the show celebrated its tenth anniversary. Filming of the new fourth season took place in early 2006 in the pavilion &quot;Mosfilm&quot;. The premiere of the new season was broadcast on STS channel in September 2006.

The city yard set was re-vamped to reflect a more realistic depiction of modern-day urban Russia. An intact oak tree grows in the center of this courtyard, and windows from surrounding houses face each other so neighbors can pop their heads out to greet one another. The set includes a creative art center and a playground with an urban backdrop of buildings that was made grittier, a bit grey, with Khrushchev-style buildings in the background. Businka and Kubik&#x27;s rooms change into a two-story house with a balcony.

New cast members included Yamila and Altin, two sisters recently arrived in Russia from Kazakhstan. The show also tackled the issue of adoption by introducing a young boy named Kolya who was adopted by Aunt Dinara and her husband, Uncle Jura.

Season 4 introduced a new recurring segment inspired by Prairie Dawn&#x27;s art show from &quot;Play with Me Sesame&quot; where Businka shows artwork done by kids.

Celebrity guests for the season included TV presenter Tina Kandelaki, actress Olga Prokofiev (&quot;My Fair Nanny&quot;), Ekaterina Guseva, Vladimir Turchinsky (Dynamo Moscow), Natasha Podolsk, Varvara, Vladimir Asimov, and children&#x27;s group &quot;Fidget&quot;.

== Content ==
One of the show&#x27;s primary goals was to teach children about living in a democratic and diverse society, particularly with the recent fall of the Soviet Union. Other goals included instilling pride in children&#x27;s culture and traditions, and to display a supportive environment in which children could feel secure. Children from different ethnic groups, as well as disabled and deaf children, were included in different segments. Cultural content included traditional Russian dances, instruments, and foods.

In addition to original content produced in Moscow, the show also featured Russian-dubbed clips of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Global Grover&quot; and &quot;Play with Me Sesame&quot;; these comprised about 30-50% of the show&#x27;s content.

The series is set in a Russian courtyard with a playground, surrounded by a mixture of traditional, rural, and urban architecture.

==Characters==
Human characters included:

* Aunt Dasha, who lives in a traditional cottage and preserves Russian folklore and traditions
* Katya, an 8-year old girl who is fond of classical music.
* Katya&#x27;s mother, a physician
* Katya&#x27;s father, a repair man

Muppet characters included:
* Zeliboba (Зелибоба), a nine-foot furry blue Dvorovoi (tree spirit) who enjoys dancing, can smell music, and tries hard to be polite. He slightly resembles a hound in some aspects (long muzzle, floppy ears and a keen sense of smell), and always wears a long fuzzy cloak that looks somewhat like a regal mantle decorated with leaves and fluffy catkins.
* Businka (Бусинка), &quot;bead&quot;, is a bright pink monster who finds joy in everything.
* Kubik (Кубик), &quot;cube&quot;, is an orange monster who is the resident pensive problem-solver.
* Kermit
* Korzhik, the series&#x27; version of Cookie Monster
* Vlas and Enik, the series&#x27; versions of Bert and Ernie 
* Znak, the series&#x27; version of Count von Count

== Episodes ==
The first season consisted of 52 half-hour episodes, which were broadcast over the show&#x27;s first two years on air. The pilot episode shown to the press in January 1996 showed children from various Russian ethnic groups exploring Moscow&#x27;s Pet Market.

By the time of 2005, the program had 3 seasons consisting of 156 half-hour episodes in total.

== Legacy ==
In 2022 the original producer, Natasha Lance Rogoff, released a non-fiction book, &quot;Muppets in Moscow,&quot; detailing the show&#x27;s production.

<text>Alexander Theodor von Middendorff (; 18 August 1815 – 24 January 1894) was a Russian zoologist and explorer of Baltic German and Estonian extraction. He was known for his expedition in 1843–45 to the extreme north and east of Siberia, describing the effects of permafrost on the spread of animals and plants.

== Early life ==
Middendorff&#x27;s mother, Sophia Johanson (1782–1868), the daughter of an Estonian farmer, had been sent to Saint Petersburg for education by her parents. There, she met with the future director of the St. Petersburg Pedagogical Institute, Theodor Johann von Middendorff (1776–1856), whose father was a Baltic German pastor in Karuse, Estonia. As the two young people came from different social ranks and were unable to marry each other, their daughter Anette (b. 1809) and son Alexander were born out of wedlock. Alexander was born on 18 August 1815 in St. Petersburg, but could not be baptized until six months later in the Estonian Lutheran Congregation of St. Petersburg, as the German Lutheran Congregation of St. Petersburg had not agreed to perform the baptism. In the accompanying paperwork, Middendorff&#x27;s parents registered themselves as a married couple. In order to escape the attention of the public, the mother and son returned to Estonia, where they settled at the Pööravere Mansion. Only in 1824, when the young Middendorff was ready to go to school, was his status legitimized when his parents finally married. (Note: Although his father Theodor was Baltic German, Middendorff&#x27;s middle name is sometimes spelled as &quot;Theodorowitsch&quot;,
a German corruption of the Russian patronymic Федорович (Fyodorovich); &quot;-ovich&quot; meaning &quot;the son of&quot; the person (father) whose name precedes it.)

== Education ==
Middendorff received his early education from tutors in Reval and at a gymnasium in Saint Petersburg. From 1832, he pursued a medical degree at the Imperial University of Dorpat where his professors included Georg Friedrich Parrot, Nikolay Ivanovich Pirogov, Hermann Martin Asmuss, and Alexander Friedrich von Hueck. Middendorff graduated in 1837 with a dissertation (written in Latin) on polyps in the bronchi. He then undertook further studies at the Humboldt University of Berlin, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, University of Vienna, and University of Breslau.

== Explorer and scientist ==
In 1839, under the patronage of Karl Ernst von Baer, he became assistant professor of zoology at Kiev University.

In the summer of 1840, Baer asked Middendorff to join his second expedition to Novaya Zemlya (the first one took place in 1837). Due to stormy conditions, the expedition failed to reach Novaya Zemlya, but Baer and Middendorff explored Russian and Norwegian Lapland, as well as the Barents and White Seas. Middendorff was tasked with crossing on foot the Kola Peninsula and mapping the peninsula from Kola to Kandalaksha while collecting zoological and botanical material.

Baer suggested Middendorff to the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences as leader of a follow-up expedition and supplied extended expedition instructions in 1842/43 in a print-ready typescript. They comprised over 200 pages and a permafrost map of Eurasia. From 1843 to 1845, Middendorff travelled with these instructions, to the Taymyr Peninsula and then along the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk and entered the lower Amur River valley (which at this time was Chinese territory). He published his findings in &quot;Reise in den äußersten Norden und Osten Sibiriens&quot; (Travels in the extreme north and east of Siberia) in German (1848–1875), which included an account of the effects of permafrost on the spread of animals and plants. He also wrote &quot;Die Isepiptesen Russlands&quot; (1855), an account of bird migration in Russia, and a monograph on molluscs, &quot;Beiträge zu einer Malacozoologia Rossica&quot; (1847–1849), in which he coined the term radula.Baer&#x27;s expedition instructions had the German title „Materialien zur Kenntniss des unvergänglichen Boden-Eises in Sibirien“ (=materials for the knowledge of the perennial ground ice in Siberia). Although print-ready in 1843, the text remained lost for more than 150 years. Thus, in 2001, the discovery and annotated publication of the typescript in the library archives of the University of Giessen was a scientific sensation. The full text of the expedition instructions is available online (234 pages). The editor Lorenz King added to the facsimile reprint a preface in English, two colour permafrost maps of Eurasia. The text is introduced with detailed comments and references on additional 66 pages written by the Estonian historian Erki Tammiksaar.

In 1870, Middendorff visited the Baraba steppe and in 1878 the Fergana Valley.

==Personal life and death==
Middendorf was married to Hedwig. His son Ernst von Middendorff was also an ornithologist.

Middendorf died in 1894 at Hellenorm, Kreis Dorpat, in Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire (now Valga County, Estonia).

==Legacy==

Middendorff&#x27;s grasshopper warbler, Cape Middendorff of Novaya Zemlya, Kodiak bear (&quot;Ursus arctos middendorffi&quot;), and Middendorff Bay of the Taymyr Peninsula are named after him. He coined the term aufeis.

<text>Shalom Sesame is an anglicized variation of &quot;Rechov Sumsum&quot; (רחוב סומסום), the Israeli version of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which originally aired in 1983. &quot;Shalom Sesame&quot; was produced in 1986 and between 1990 and 1991 for the direct-to-video market in the United States, aimed at introducing Israel and Judaism to children that are not necessarily fluent in the Hebrew language, since &quot;Rechov Sumsum&quot; is completely done in Hebrew. Beginning in April 1988, the &quot;Shalom Sesame&quot; episodes were broadcast on PBS following their video releases.

It includes characters from both &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Rechov Sumsum&quot;, the Hebrew/Arabic version of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, produced and aired in Israel, the Palestinian territories, and Jordan.

Also, as with the American series, the series featured special guests well known to American viewers. Guests included Itzhak Perlman, Bonnie Franklin, Mary Tyler Moore, Mandy Patinkin, Alan King, Joan Rivers, Nell Carter, Jerry Stiller, Jeremy Miller, Anne Meara, Tracey Gold, B.B. King, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Paul Shaffer.

In October 2010, a new 12-part &quot;Shalom Sesame&quot; series began, with stars including Jake Gyllenhaal, Christina Applegate, Debra Messing, Greg Kinnear, Anneliese van der Pol, and Cedric the Entertainer. The new series added Mahboub, an Arab Israeli Muppet, and other new characters from the 2006 revival of &quot;Rechov Sumsum&quot;. It also features the Israeli singer Ayal Ingedashet, of Ethiopian Jewish background, as the human character Lamlam in each series. The only revival episodes broadcast on PBS Kids were &quot;Chanukah: The Missing Menorah&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Passover, Grover!&quot;
It was directed by Aaron Kaplan who followed by directing all the local sesame series thereafter.

==Characters from &quot;Rechov Sumsum&quot;==
* Kipi Ben Kipod, (קיפי בן קיפוד) (translated means Kippi son of Hedgehog) a pink, giant, cheerful and optimistic porcupine analogous to Big Bird, he has a pet goat named Sheba. Kippi first appeared on Rechov Sumsum in 1983, and Kippi also appeared in Barrio Sésamo as Espinete, A big, human-sized pink hedgehog that does not wear clothes during the day, despite having used disguises (including a wizard, Dracula and a superhero called Super Espi).

<doc id="648159" wikidata="Q6768272" url="?curid=648159" title="Mark Johnston (racehorse trainer)">
<text>Mark Johnston (born 10 October 1959) is a Scottish racehorse trainer based in Middleham, North Yorkshire, England.

Born in Glasgow, he studied at the University of Glasgow and is a qualified vet. He started training at a stable near Louth, Lincolnshire in 1987, and his first winner was Hinari Video at Carlisle He has been training in Middleham since 1988 when he purchased Kingsley House (often falsely attributed to be the former home of Charles Kingsley, author of &quot;The Water Babies&quot;).

In 2004 he won the 1,000 Guineas with Attraction. Other successful horses he has trained are Mister Baileys, winner of the 2,000 Guineas, Shamardal, 2004 European Champion Two-Year-Old, and Double Trigger, winner of the Ascot Gold Cup.

Johnston&#x27;s horses are known for their front running style and bravery in a finish, two attributes that were best advertised by the exploits of Attraction. He cites Shamardal as the best horse he ever trained, and Attraction as the one he is most proud of.

He reached his 4,000th winner on the flat in Britain when Dominating won at Pontefract on Monday 23 October 2017. He is only the third trainer in either code to reach that figure.

On 23 August 2018 Johnston became the most successful British Flat trainer of all time when Frankie Dettori rode Poet&#x27;s Society to win the 3.00 at York at odds of 20–1 to give Mark his 4,194 winner. In August 2022 he took his number of winners to 5,000 when Dubai Mile won at Kempton Park.

In January 2022 Johnston&#x27;s son and assistant trainer, Charlie, joined him as joint training licence holder. As joint trainers the pair were responsible for 176 winners in 2022. In December 2022 Mark Johnston announced that he would step down from the training licence, leaving Charlie as the sole trainer with Mark as assistant trainer. Johnston stressed that he wasn&#x27;t retiring and the training partnership would continue as before.

The motto of the stable is &quot;Always Trying&quot;.

He is married to Deirdre, a former teacher.

<doc id="648165" wikidata="Q2384396" url="?curid=648165" title="TI BASIC (TI 99/4A)">
<text>TI BASIC is an ANSI-compliant interpreter for the BASIC programming language built into the 1979 Texas Instruments TI-99/4 home computer and its improved 1981 version, the TI-99/4A.

In contrast to most BASICs found on contemporary microcomputers, TI BASIC does not trace its history to Microsoft BASIC, but was instead developed in-house following the emerging Minimal BASIC standard being created by ANSI and ECMA. This was, in turn, based on the original Dartmouth BASIC from the 1960s. There are a number of differences, sometimes subtle, between TI BASIC and the more common MS varieties.

Minimal BASIC lacks a number of features that are commonly found on contemporary BASICs, and Texas Instruments later introduced the TI Extended BASIC cartridge that enhanced the functionality accessible to BASIC users. This included a wide variety of features found in other BASICs, as well as new system functions for sprite handling, sound, and other features of the platform.

As was common on home computers, TI BASIC was used not only for programming but also as a thin operating system. On top of Minimal BASIC, TI added commands for text, graphics, and basic file operations like recording to tape or any other file system. Due to the specifics of the TI-99 platform, TI BASIC was most notable for its extremely slow performance, roughly half that of common machines, but conversely sported high numerical accuracy.

== Performance ==
The TI-99 was based on the TMS9900 microprocessor, a 16-bit design that was originally built to provide a single-chip central processing unit (CPU) in low-end models of their TI-990 minicomputer lineup. The TMS9900 was also suitable for use in a microcomputer, but at that time the rest of the support chips required to build a complete computer were invariably 8-bit, and this included TI&#x27;s wide catalog of such chips. In a minicomputer, 16-bit support systems were built up of many individual chips, but this was not suitable for a low-cost product. TI thus adopted the solution of making the machine mostly 8-bit and connecting the various support chips to this 8-bit bus, with the TMS9900 reading the bus twice to produce a 16-bit value.

The TMS9900&#x27;s instruction set architecture was based on 16-bit opcodes, meaning that programs would generally be twice as large as they would be on an 8-bit machine. In the era of expensive memory, this presented a significant cost. To address this, TI created an 8-bit virtual machine with its own language or intermediate representation known as the &quot;Graphic Programming Language&quot;, or GPL, that allowed programs to be written in a more compact format. The downside to this approach is that every GPL instruction had to be converted on the fly into one or more underlying TMS9900 instructions. The GPL code itself was stored on the 8-bit side of the machine, further slowing its performance.

For all of these reasons, the machine ran far slower than it was theoretically capable of. This was particularly noticeable in BASIC. Every instruction in the user&#x27;s program had to be read from 8-bit memory, interpreted using code written in GPL, and then output back over the 8-bit bus again. As a result, TI BASIC had poor performance; on common benchmarks of the era, the TI-99 generally ran half as fast as 8-bit machines like the Commodore PET or Apple II. For instance, running the Byte Sieve in BASIC took 3960 seconds in TI BASIC, while the same test in Applesoft BASIC on the Apple II, ostensibly a much slower machine, took 2806 seconds, about 30% faster that the TI.

== Elements of TI BASIC ==
===Editing and running===
Unlike most BASICs of the era, TI BASIC did not provide a full-screen editor. Instead, a line editor was provided, which allowed the user to add or edit one line at a time. Explicit line numbers were used to order each statement. It used a prompt to indicate the current new line in immediate mode, as opposed to the more common . Line numbers ranged from 1 to 32767, inclusive, and entering a line outside that range resulted in the &quot;BAD LINE NUMBER&quot; error. Line entry was aided by the command, available only in immediate mode, which entered ascending line numbers, and , which renumbered an existing program.

TI BASIC also included a number of debugging commands. worked something like , stopping execution on certain lines. Unlike , the exit to immediate mode did not occur on the line where appeared, but on the lines referred to. For instance, would cause the program to exit to immediate mode whenever it moved to line 130. This could be used, for example, by inserting a single at the top of the program to control execution, rather than having to insert a in the middle of the code. turned off existing breakpoints. Additionally, printed out the line number of the currently executing line in angle-brackets: etc, and turned it off.

=== Statements ===
The ANSI-compatible statements of TI BASIC are codice_1. Most of these operate in the same fashion as their MS counterparts with two additions; restarts the random number generator at a given &quot;seed&quot; value, and sets the first entry in arrays to either 0 or 1, whereas MS is always zero-based. To this standard set it added codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5.

In keeping with the Minimal BASIC standard, statements could only perform branches, they could not perform arbitrary statements as was common in almost every other BASIC of the era. For instance, code such as:

is not valid in TI BASIC. Instead, this would have to be performed using multiple lines:

This can easily lead to off-by-one errors if the conversion is not careful about changing the sense of the boolean comparison. TI BASIC did, however, support the clause:

The statement used colons to separate items on different lines, in addition to the more common comma or semicolon. This precluded its use as a statement separator, a concept that TI BASIC did not have. This means a line can have only a single statement. Due to the way BASIC interpreters work, -based loops can be sped up significantly by combining code onto a single line, which reduces the number of lines in the program and the corresponding amount of time needed to find a particular line number. This seemingly minor missing feature may result in much slower code, and adding this feature was part of TI Extended BASIC.

Extensions to the Minimal BASIC system were often not represented directly in BASIC, but were instead accessed via the command and a series of named GPL-based subroutines. For instance, clears the screen, and returns the keycode of the currently pressed key on the keyboard. The language lacked codice_6 and codice_7 so there was no official way to create new CALLable code within BASIC, to do this one would require the TI Editor/Assembler, the TI Mini Memory cartridge which included a small assembler, or by using Extended BASIC.

=== Functions ===
Unlike Microsoft BASICs, which used codice_1, codice_1, codice_1, and codice_1 for manipulating strings, TI BASIC used the ANSI-compliant codice_1 and codice_1.
; : Absolute value
; : ASCII numeric value of the first character of a string
; : Arctangent
; : Convert a number into a string with an ASCII character
; : Cosine
; : Test whether the end of a file has been reached
; : Exponentiation
; : greatest integer less than or equal to the parameter
; : Length of a string
; : Natural logarithm
; : First occurrence of a string in another string
; : Pseudorandom number generator
; : Return a substring of a string
; : Sign function
; : Sine
; : Square root
; : Convert a number to a string
; : Tangent
; : Convert a string to a number

=== Subprograms ===
Subprograms are called with codice_2 statement (e.g. codice_15).

* codice_16 Definition of graphical characters
* codice_17 Clears the screen
* codice_18 Defines foreground- and background color for 8 characters
* codice_19 Reads one character at a specified position from the screen
* codice_20 Writes a character to a screen position and repeats it horizontally
* codice_21 Returns the position of the joystick
* codice_22 Reads from the keyboard without echo on the screen
* codice_23 Changes the color of the screen
* codice_24 Creates sounds (using a frequency) and noise
* codice_25 Writes a character to a screen position and repeats it vertically

==Extended BASIC==
TI BASIC was located in the system&#x27;s internal ROMs. In 1981, TI released a plug-in ROM cartridge that added additional functions to the existing code, improving the language in a number of ways. Known as Extended BASIC, it was a highly anticipated addition to the platform.

Among the changes was the addition of the ability to have multiple statements on a line. Using multiple statements may improve performance; loops that are implemented in a single line run much faster. Additionally, statements could now span several lines. As the underlying dialect already used the colon for string separators, Extended BASIC used the double-colon for this purpose. Confusingly, as a statement with two colons was also possible in TI BASIC, for instance, , which would output &quot;A&quot;, a blank line and then &quot;B&quot;, so these statements required a space to be added in Extended BASIC, .

Another overdue addition was that statements could now perform arbitrary statements, rather than only a . In Extended BASIC one could write a simple statement like . This also worked in the clause, allowing statements like .

Other additions include a small selection of new statements, including , , , , , , , and . The last three statements are used for structured programming, allowing the creation of named subroutines. Extended BASIC also included a number of new functions and especially CALLable routines. Among the latter was a library of sprite commands, including ones that created motion that continued automatically.

===Speech synthesis===
When equipped with the TI Speech Synthesizer, TI Extended BASIC users could also generate speech from a predefined vocabulary as easily as writing text on-screen. For example, the following line of text would cause the speech synthesizer to identify the computer:

 CALL SAY(&quot;HELLO I AM A #TEXAS INSTRUMENTS# T I NINETY NINE FOUR A HOME COMPUTER&quot;) 

Multi-word phrases are delimited with the # symbol, as codice_26 in this example. Using a word not included in the speech synthesizer&#x27;s built-in vocabulary of 338 words and phrases would cause it to slowly spell out the word. TI&#x27;s Terminal Emulator II cartridge provided text-to-speech functionality.

<doc id="648166" wikidata="Q3537483" url="?curid=648166" title="Transfer (group theory)">
<text>In the mathematical field of group theory, the transfer defines, given a group &quot;G&quot; and a subgroup &quot;H&quot; of finite index, a group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to the abelianization of &quot;H&quot;. It can be used in conjunction with the Sylow theorems to obtain certain numerical results on the existence of finite simple groups.

The transfer was defined by and rediscovered by .

==Construction==
The construction of the map proceeds as follows: Let [&quot;G&quot;:&quot;H&quot;] = &quot;n&quot; and select coset representatives, say 
:formula_1
for &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, so &quot;G&quot; can be written as a disjoint union
:formula_2
Given &quot;y&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, each &quot;yxi&quot; is in some coset &quot;xjH&quot; and so 
:formula_3
for some index &quot;j&quot; and some element &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; of &quot;H&quot;. 
The value of the transfer for &quot;y&quot; is defined to be the image of the product 
:formula_4
in &quot;H&quot;/&quot;H&quot;′, where &quot;H&quot;′ is the commutator subgroup of &quot;H&quot;. The order of the factors is irrelevant since &quot;H&quot;/&quot;H&quot;′ is abelian.

It is straightforward to show that, though the individual &quot;hi&quot; depends on the choice of coset representatives, the value of the transfer does not. It is also straightforward to show that the mapping defined this way is a homomorphism.

==Example==

If &quot;G&quot; is cyclic then the transfer takes any element &quot;y&quot; of &quot;G&quot; to &quot;y&quot;[&quot;G&quot;:&quot;H&quot;].

A simple case is that seen in the Gauss lemma on quadratic residues, which in effect computes the transfer for the multiplicative group of non-zero residue classes modulo a prime number &quot;p&quot;, with respect to the subgroup {1, −1}. One advantage of looking at it that way is the ease with which the correct generalisation can be found, for example for cubic residues in the case that &quot;p&quot; − 1 is divisible by three.

==Homological interpretation==

This homomorphism may be set in the context of group homology. In general, given any subgroup &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot; and any &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;A&quot;, there is a corestriction map of homology groups formula_5 induced by the inclusion map formula_6, but if we have that &quot;H&quot; is of finite index in &quot;G&quot;, there are also restriction maps formula_7. In the case of &quot;n =&quot; 1 and formula_8 with the trivial &quot;G&quot;-module structure, we have the map formula_9. Noting that formula_10 may be identified with formula_11 where formula_12 is the commutator subgroup, this gives the transfer map via formula_13, with formula_14 denoting the natural projection. The transfer is also seen in algebraic topology, when it is defined between classifying spaces of groups.

==Terminology==

The name &quot;transfer&quot; translates the German &quot;Verlagerung&quot;, which was coined by Helmut Hasse.

==Commutator subgroup==

If &quot;G&quot; is finitely generated, the commutator subgroup &quot;G&quot;′ of &quot;G&quot; has finite index in &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H=G&quot;′, then the corresponding transfer map is trivial. In other words, the map sends &quot;G&quot; to 0 in the abelianization of &quot;G&quot;′. This is important in proving the principal ideal theorem in class field theory. See the Emil Artin-John Tate &quot;Class Field Theory&quot; notes.

<doc id="648201" wikidata="Q2359665" url="?curid=648201" title="Paschal greeting">
<text>The Paschal greeting, also known as the Easter Acclamation or Easter Day Greeting, is an Easter custom among many Christian churches, including Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregational. 

One offers the greeting &quot;Christ is risen!&quot; and the response is &quot;Indeed He is Risen!&quot; or &quot;He is risen indeed!&quot; with many variants in English and other languages (compare Matthew 27 -, Matthew 28-, Mark 16-, Luke 24-, ).

==Theories on origin==
Credits for the origin of the greeting vary. However, the phrase &quot;Christ is risen&quot; is likely a shortened piece from Matthew 28:5-6, &quot;The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.&quot; 

There are two competing theories for the source of the response, &quot;He is risen indeed.&quot; The first follows the tradition, not mentioned in the Bible, of Mary Magdalene bringing an egg to Emperor Tiberius. She then greeted the emperor with the words, &quot;Christ is risen.&quot; Others believe that the response comes from the Gospel of Luke 24:33-34 &quot;There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together and saying, &#x27;It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.&#x27;&quot; Regardless of the initial source, the phrase has become part of the Christian tradition. The greeting is used by many to celebrate the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter morning.

==Examples==
It is used among members of some Christian denominations when meeting one another during Eastertide; some even text or answer their phones with the phrase.

===Eastern Orthodox===
The greeting and reply are:

Christ is Risen! – Truly He is Risen!

*In the original language, 
*In the most widely-used language, 

A list in 57 languages is found at the website of the Orthodox Church in America.

In some cultures, such as in Russia and Serbia, it is also customary to exchange a triple kiss of peace on alternating cheeks after the greeting.

===Roman Catholic===
In the Latin Church, the traditional greeting on Easter morning and throughout the Easter Octave is: &quot;Christus surréxit! - Surréxit vere, allelúja&quot; (“Christ is risen!” - “He is risen indeed, Alleluia!”). This ancient phrase is similar to the Greek one, and echoes the greeting of the angel to Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James, as they arrived at the sepulchre to anoint the body of Jesus: &quot;He is not here; for he has risen, as he said&quot; (Matthew 28:6).

<text>Chris Avellone (/ˈævəloʊn/) is an American video game designer and comic book writer. He is known for his significant roles on a large number of video games, primarily role-playing video games, praised for their writing across his three-decade career.

Avellone joined Interplay in 1995 and was one of the designers of &quot;Fallout 2&quot; (1998) and the lead designer of &quot;&quot; (1999), the latter of which has been regarded as &quot;one of the best-written and most imaginative video games ever created&quot;. After departing Interplay in 2003, he became one of the co-founders and the chief creative officer of Obsidian Entertainment, where he was the lead designer of &quot;Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot; (2004) and a senior designer on &quot;&quot; (2010). From 2012 on, he was involved with some of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter, becoming known as a &quot;human stretch goal&quot;.

Avellone departed Obsidian in 2015 and has since worked as a freelancer for various companies on games such as &quot;Prey&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&quot; (2019) and &quot;&quot; (2021).

In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time and by Gamasutra as one of the top 20 game writers. In 2017, he was named by GamesTM as one of the then 50 most influential people in gaming.

== Early life ==
Avellone grew up in Alexandria, Virginia. At the age of 9, he first learned about &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; while playing catch with a friend from the neighborhood who started describing a &quot;strange game of make-believe where you could pretend to be a dwarf, elf, fighter and you could explore dungeons, fight monsters, and take their treasure.&quot; After trying to put together a group to play with, he realized that no one wanted to be the group&#x27;s game master and he had to learn how to fill the role himself, experiencing the game vicariously through the players and looking for new ways to entertain them.

He attended the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in nearby Fairfax County. While in high school, he visited a friend&#x27;s house and saw &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale II: The Destiny Knight&quot; by Interplay Productions running on the Commodore 64, which made him realize a computer game master could also run a game for him and resulted in him playing every computer RPG he could get his hands on, without considering at the time that he could seek a career in computer games.

Upon finishing high school, he moved south and pursued a degree in architecture at Virginia Tech because he had enjoyed drawing maps and structures for his pen-and-paper gaming sessions. After two years, however, he realized his &quot;sketchbook was often filled with more sentences than sketches&quot;, which made him question himself and led to him transferring to the College of William &amp; Mary and switching over to English as his major, graduating in 1994 with a minor in fine arts as well.

His first job was for a role-playing company called Day by Day Associates, and involved role-playing a criminal at the local police academy and at Hogan&#x27;s Alley in Quantico, Virginia to help train police officers and FBI agents. He later worked in a toy store and as a campus center supervisor.

== Career ==
=== 1993-2003: Tabletop games and Interplay ===
==== Early projects, &quot;Fallout 2&quot; and &quot;Planescape: Torment&quot; ====
Avellone&#x27;s hobby of gamemastering for tabletop roleplaying games made him try to get his adventures and articles published. Starting in his high school years, he sent a large number of submissions to &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine, &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, Palladium Books, GURPS and Hero Games, but they were all rejected. However, when Hero Games had a new product line for their &quot;Champions&quot; RPG called &quot;Dark Champions&quot; and needed writers, Hero Games&#x27; line editor Bruce Harlick contacted Avellone, asking him to write a character book for it, which he agreed to, resulting in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Underworld Enemies&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Dystopia&quot; in 1994, &quot;Widows &amp; Orphans&quot; in 1997 and &quot;New Bedlam Asylum&quot; in 1998, as well as contributions to the adventure anthologies &quot;Heroic Adventures Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Volume 2&quot; in 1996 and to &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Alarums and Excursions&quot;, &quot;Adventurers Club&quot; and &quot;Shadis&quot; throughout that period. Avellone was also one of the authors involved in the fanzine &quot;Haymaker!&quot; alongside Harlick.

After asking Steve Peterson, his editor at Hero Games, to help him find him a job with a steady paycheck, Peterson put in a recommendation for him with Mark O&#x27;Green, the head of Interplay Productions&#x27; Dragonplay division. At the beginning of June 1995, Avellone flew to Irvine, California and interviewed with O&#x27;Green, who asked him hard questions about how he would go about designing a video game using the &quot;Planescape&quot; license, which Interplay held the video game rights for at the time. Avellone told him he would &quot;start at the death screen, and just tell the story of what happens after that&quot;. O&#x27;Green was intrigued and hired him as a junior designer.

His first task at Interplay was to design cities for a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game set in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. When that project was cancelled a few months later, he was transferred to the role of a level designer on &quot;Descent to Undermountain&quot;, a first person 3D dungeon crawler that was also set in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; and repurposed the engine used by 1995&#x27;s spaceship combat game &quot;Descent&quot;. According to Avellone: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what I was getting into! I was very happy to work on it at the time, though. They were trying to add gravity and first-person combat into the &quot;Descent&quot; engine, you know, so they could create something [like] &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;. The engine just wasn&#x27;t set up to do that, and we didn&#x27;t have the sheer amount of programming power available to make that happen.&quot;

While working on &quot;Undermountain&quot;, he was also asked to contribute writing and design to other games. The first of these to be released was &quot;Conquest of the New World&quot;, a turn-based historical strategy game developed by Quicksilver Software which was published by Interplay in 1996. Because Quicksilver were only a few streets away from Interplay, designers from Interplay including Avellone were asked to help with lore additions to the game whenever needed. He then contributed mission design to Interplay&#x27;s 1997 game &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Academy&quot;, a space flight simulator that made extensive use of full motion video.

By late 1996, Feargus Urquhart – who had replaced O&#x27;Green as the head of Interplay&#x27;s role-playing division, soon to be known as Black Isle Studios – was being mandated to make use of the &quot;Planescape&quot; license by his superiors and became interested in making a game for it using the Infinity Engine, the isometric engine in BioWare&#x27;s &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, which was then in development and which Interplay had access to as BioWare&#x27;s publisher. Urquhart asked Avellone if he was interested in being the lead designer on the new project and Avellone agreed, seeing it as an opportunity. Avellone initially titled the game &quot;Planescape: Last Rites&quot;, and, recalling the design ideas he had shared with O&#x27;Green in his hiring interview, used them as the starting point for the game&#x27;s vision document, which was warmly received by Interplay&#x27;s studio head Brian Fargo, who nonetheless asked Avellone to promise he could actually deliver on it. During the game&#x27;s pre-production, Avellone was given a very small team that consisted of lead programmer Dan Spitzley, lead artist Tim Donley and two other artists, sharing an office with them. As Avellone described it:

Once the vision document was approved, we scaled it down and outwards and turned each bit into reality. The lead artist, Tim Donley, did sketches of each of the major locations one by one before they were arted on the computer. I then took the characters and quests and did area design documents. I wrote a first pass of much of the dialogue and companions (many of which made it all the way to the final draft). All the while our programmers started digging into the Infinity Engine (which wasn’t done at that time, since &quot;Baldur’s Gate 1&quot; was still going on) and learning more about how it worked so we could see if our ideas were feasible or not.

Avellone incorporated the many ideas for fantasy quests and characters he had gathered over the years into his design and sought to turn fantasy conventions upside down. Around this time, Tim Cain also offered Avellone a role on &quot;Fallout&quot; as a designer, but Avellone had to turn him down because, between &quot;Last Rites&quot; and his continued responsibilities on &quot;Undermountain&quot;, he was already overburdened with work, and he recommended Scott Bennie for the role instead.

At the beginning of 1997, Avellone asked Urquhart to be transferred to full-time work on &quot;Last Rites&quot; because he no longer felt there was much he could contribute to &quot;Undermountain&quot; given that game&#x27;s development troubles, but this request was only granted in the summer of that year. When Colin McComb was assigned to &quot;Last Rites&quot; as its second designer in April 1997, he found that Avellone already had a broad outline of the entire game from start to finish, with all of the major characters sketched out. It was soon realized that the name &quot;Last Rites&quot; was already trademarked and being used for another company&#x27;s game, which led to their project being renamed into &quot;&quot; after many other possible names for it were rejected. Throughout that period, Avellone also contributed writing to Interplay&#x27;s racing combat game &quot;Red Asphalt&quot; and Treyarch&#x27;s swordfighting action-adventure game &quot;Die by the Sword&quot;, both of them released in early 1998.

&quot;Undermountain&quot; was finally released in January 1998 and sold poorly and was widely panned by critics. That same month, &quot;Fallout&quot;&#x27;s central creative trio of Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky and Jason Anderson decided to leave Interplay and start their own company which they named Troika Games. This created an uncertain future for &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, which they had been leading development on for a few months, so designers, programmers and artists were taken from other projects and assigned to help with it. This included Avellone, who became an area designer on the game and designed New Reno, Vault City, the raider caves and the game&#x27;s various special encounters. His work on New Reno is how Avellone &quot;first came to people&#x27;s attention&quot;, as it has been called &quot;one of the most beloved locations in any RPG&quot; and &quot;possibly Avellone&#x27;s single greatest creation [...] emblematic of everything a true RPG should be: non-linear, dynamic, detailed, and expertly written&quot;. &quot;Fallout 2&quot; was released in October 1998 and has been ranked by video game publications as one of the best RPGs of all time, though Avellone has expressed misgivings about the game&#x27;s tonal inconsistencies and overuse of breaking the fourth wall.

While working on &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, he also continued writing the story and dialogue for &quot;Torment&quot;, which led to him having 160 hour workweeks that kept him exhausted. Once &quot;Fallout 2&quot; was finished, he immediately had to enter crunch time again on &quot;Torment&quot; as the game&#x27;s development team expanded from the 10 people it had at that point to between 35 and 40 by the end. McComb would later estimate that, although there were seven other designers on his team, Avellone did approximately half of the design work on the project. However, as the game&#x27;s localization costs mounted due to its long script and quality assurance testers regarded it as the strangest game they had worked on, Avellone thought that &quot;Torment&quot; would be poorly received at large and was afraid he was going to be fired. When &quot;Torment&quot; was released in December 1999, it instead sold moderately well and received very positive reviews. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time and has been especially praised for reaching a quality of writing that had not existed in games up to that point.

By the end of the game&#x27;s development, Avellone&#x27;s health had declined significantly from the long hours and he was advised by his doctor to not continue down that path. Interplay&#x27;s vice president Trish Wright also became concerned and helped reduce his workload. When Urquhart and Donley asked him if he was willing to work on a sequel to &quot;Torment&quot;, Avellone declined, saying he was too tired.

==== &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; series, &quot;Van Buren&quot; and collaborations with Snowblind ====

Most of the &quot;Torment&quot; team then wanted to work on a new fantasy intellectual property which became known as &quot;Black Isle&#x27;s Torn&quot;, while Avellone opted to join a different team inside Black Isle which, after the release of &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, had spent a few months working on a sequel for that game, but had not made good progress in that time with either its design or its switch to a new 3D engine. After promising them another chance to make that sequel in the future, Urquhart had tasked them in May 1999 with developing &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, a more traditional &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game which, like &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, was set in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; and also used the Infinity Engine, but was more linear and had a strong focus on dungeon crawling. Despite joining halfway through development, Avellone wrote the dialogues of all the major NPCs in &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; and also edited those written by the other designers. Additionally, he designed a number of quests for the starting town of Easthaven and many of the special items in the game, as well as writing the game&#x27;s narrative style guide and manual. He was also one of the few technical designers involved with directly implementing content in the game. &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; was released in June 2000 and was well-received, but was regarded by Avellone and the general public as not pushing the genre forward compared to Black Isle&#x27;s previous games.

During his time on &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, Avellone also wrote a vision document for the project codenamed &quot;Van Buren&quot;, which was the promised next attempt at continuing the &quot;Fallout&quot; series. Once it was approved, he became the lead designer on it and worked on it for the next three years, doing area design, maps, character breakdowns, items and plot elements for all the locations in the game. Avellone felt the game had the potential to be better than &quot;Torment&quot;, as everything in its design seemed to be clicking into place, but none of the teams at Black Isle were available to work on it, and it languished in pre-production with Avellone as the sole person assigned to it, his only chance to playtest and refine his design coming from tabletop sessions based around it that he ran for his fellow developers.

A few weeks after the release of &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, work began on an expansion pack for it called &quot;Heart of Winter&quot;. At fellow designer Josh Sawyer&#x27;s suggestion, its story was based on the lore Avellone had written for one of his Easthaven quests, and Avellone continued his dialogue-focused duties on the title. &quot;Heart of Winter&quot; was released in February 2001 and was not as well-received as the original game, mainly because of its short length. To allay the fans&#x27; complaints, the team including Avellone then developed a free but smaller downloadable expansion called &quot;Trials of the Luremaster&quot;, which was released in July 2001.

During &quot;Heart of Winter&quot;&#x27;s development, Avellone was also asked to write the story for &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot;, a console action RPG that Interplay had tasked Snowblind Studios with developing in an attempt to enter the increasingly lucrative console market. Although Avellone quickly wrote a draft of the storyline that he liked, it became a target for what he called &quot;the most mind-boggling iterations and suggestions&quot; from his bosses, and he was unhappy with the result as he felt it was lacking and not similar to his original vision.

&quot;Black Isle&#x27;s Torn&quot;, which Avellone did not work on but had offered occasional design input on, was cancelled in July 2001, as Urquhart estimated it would not be done in time to help Interplay with the financial difficulties it was going through. Development on &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; was started in its place, once again using the Infinity Engine, with Sawyer as the lead designer and Avellone doing area design for the starting town of Targos and for Kuldahar, which he greatly enjoyed because of the unusual amount of freedom the designers were given on the project. &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; was released in August 2002 and received positive reviews, although the public felt its engine had become too dated.

In early 2002, production began on &quot;&quot;, an alternate history action RPG developed by Reflexive Entertainment and published by Interplay, on which Avellone was assigned to provide design assistance for a short while after its overall storyline had already been established several months into development. Afterwards, before he could return to work on &quot;Van Buren&quot;, he contributed to the design of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate III: The Black Hound&quot;, Black Isle&#x27;s attempt at making a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game in a 3D engine that had to use &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; in its name despite having little to do with it because Interplay had supposedly retained the license for it, but not the license for the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; in general. Once the license turned out to have been lost because of unpaid royalties, &quot;The Black Hound&quot; was cancelled after a year and a half of active development, which made Urquhart leave the company in frustration in April 2003. For the first time, a full team was now available to work on &quot;Van Buren&quot;, but Avellone did not believe it was possible to make the game any longer given Interplay&#x27;s financial troubles and the management&#x27;s complete focus on the console market, so he also left the company a couple of months after Urquhart. His assessment turned out to be correct when, half a year later, Black Isle was shut down and &quot;Van Buren&quot; was cancelled.

Now a free agent, Avellone was invited by Snowblind Studios to help with the writing on their next game, &quot;Champions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest&quot; — another console action RPG in the same vein as &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; but taking place in the &quot;EverQuest&quot; universe — as they had enjoyed working with Avellone despite their relationship with Black Isle becoming frayed after Black Isle had used their engine to make &quot;Dark Alliance II&quot; without their permission or involvement.

=== 2003-2015: Chief creative officer at Obsidian Entertainment ===
==== Founding of Obsidian, &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II&quot; and &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; ====
After leaving Interplay, Avellone was asked by Urquhart to join him as one of the five co-founders of a new company named Obsidian Entertainment which aimed to develop the same kind of games as Black Isle, with Avellone accepting and becoming the company&#x27;s chief creative officer.

Obsidian received their first project very quickly when BioWare, who were almost done developing the cross-platform RPG &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; for LucasArts, passed on the opportunity to make a sequel for it and recommended Obsidian for the job based on their previous relationship with Black Isle. Avellone thus became the lead designer of &quot;Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot;, a role which he was not pleased with at first as he had not been a fan of &quot;Star Wars&quot; since his childhood, but which gradually became interesting to him as he immersed himself in the franchise, reading all of its novels and comic books, and realized he could explore the questions he had about its universe through his design and try to recapture the feeling of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, his favorite movie in the series.

However, the task of making a sequel to a AAA game was fraught with difficulties, as Obsidian initially had no employees and no office space, with the co-founders working in Urquhart&#x27;s attic. Additionally, Avellone had to write a blind first draft of the story without having played the original &quot;KOTOR&quot;, as it had not yet been released and LucasArts did not want to provide a copy of it before a full contract had been officially signed, which then led to Avellone having to start over with an entirely different story once he was able to play it.

After a contract was signed in August 2003, Obsidian were able to move into an office in Santa Ana and hire enough employees to start full production on the game by October, but still had a very aggressive schedule that required them to finish the game within a year. Avellone wrote the game&#x27;s overall storyline and most of the companions and did area design for Peragus, Malachor V, part of Nar Shaddaa and other smaller areas, while also dividing and coordinating the tasks of six other designers. &quot;KOTOR II&quot; was released on time in December 2004 in what many regarded as a partially unfinished state, but still received very positive reviews, with its story being named one of the greatest in video games and in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise.

After &quot;KOTOR II&quot;, Avellone pitched comic book publisher Dark Horse a comic named &quot;Unseen, Unheard&quot; about characters from the game, which he then wrote for the final issue of &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot; published in July 2005. This also led to him contributing short stories to the &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures&quot; comic series until it ended in December 2007.

In July 2004, Obsidian began development on &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; PC RPG taking place in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, after another situation in which BioWare, who had developed the first game, recommended Obsidian to its publisher, in this case Atari, for developing the sequel. Avellone joined the game&#x27;s development team once &quot;KOTOR II&quot; was finished and was primarily responsible for writing major characters, including the game&#x27;s companions and their associated quests, but also for implementing influence mechanics and critiquing area designs, and additionally proofread almost all the dialogue in the game. Despite the game&#x27;s design having an unrealistically large scope that created difficulties and led to its original lead designer Ferret Baudoin being replaced by Josh Sawyer in March 2006, &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; had generally favorable reviews when released in October 2006, with its story and writing noted as being its strong points.

As Obsidian began to always have multiple projects in pre-production or development at any given time, Avellone — in his capacity as the company&#x27;s chief creative officer — oversaw the high-level design on all of them, offering feedback and critiques on prototypes, game builds and design documents, as well as writing and improving pitches for new games and talking to publishers about them. Obsidian&#x27;s third project &quot;Dwarves&quot;, an RPG prequel to &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot; that Obsidian was enlisted to create by Disney in 2005, was the first one that Avellone did not have a direct role on, with his involvement instead consisting of reviewing the work done by its lead designer Kevin Saunders and its lead story writer Brian Mitsoda and offering insight into which elements in its story achieved their goals and which elements needed improvement.

In July 2006, pre-production began on &quot;Mask of the Betrayer&quot;, the first expansion pack for &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;, with Avellone offering designer George Ziets the role of creative lead on it and giving him a lot of flexibility on its story and setting, which Ziets used by exploring the religious and mythological elements in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; that were the most interesting to him. One of the five companions intended for the expansion, the half-celestial cleric Kaelyn the Dove, was almost cut early on when it was estimated she could not be written and implemented in the time the team had available. Avellone, who was not directly assigned to the project at the time, asked to write her himself so she could be kept, with Ziets remarking that she then ended up being his favorite companion in the game. Avellone also wrote a second companion for it, the spirit shaman Gann-of-Dreams. As the expansion neared release, its lead designer Kevin Saunders noted that the dialogues of the new companions were richer and longer than those of the most developed companions in &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;. &quot;Mask of the Betrayer&quot; was released in September 2007 and was well-received, with game publications calling it the best &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; experience since &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot; and &quot;Torment&quot; and sometimes referring to it as a thematic sequel of the latter.

==== &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; and &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot; ====

In early 2006, Sega expressed interest in having Obsidian develop a cross-platform RPG for them and were pitched an idea from Urquhart and fellow co-founder Chris Jones about making an espionage RPG that took place in the present and incorporated ideas from &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, &quot;James Bond&quot;, the &quot;Bourne&quot; series and &quot;24&quot;. Sega liked it and decided to pursue the project, with Obsidian intending at first to retain the intellectual property rights for it, but soon giving them to Sega in return for more funding so they could prevent layoffs when, as the deal with Sega had almost been finalized, &quot;Dwarves&quot; was cancelled by Disney because they had decided to avoid going in that game&#x27;s direction with the &quot;Snow White&quot; intellectual property after a recent change in that company&#x27;s leadership. Brian Mitsoda was reassigned from writing the story for &quot;Dwarves&quot; to being the creative lead on the espionage RPG, which was named &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot;. Sega announced their collaboration with Obsidian on a game based on new intellectual property on the 23rd of March 2006.

Near the end of 2006, Sega asked Obsidian to also begin development on a second cross-platform RPG to be published by them, this time based on the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise, with the project being named &quot;Aliens: Crucible&quot;. Avellone was assigned as its creative lead and sought to incorporate survival mechanics into the title, giving players the goal of building up a base over time and carefully managing their resources in a tense atmosphere where they would be vulnerable to attack even during conversations. The game was officially announced by Sega in December 2006.

In early 2008, when &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; was halfway through development, it became apparent that its vision had not been well-defined and that, in the absence of a project director, its leads were each trying to make a different kind of game. When Mitsoda left Obsidian soon after, Avellone was moved over to &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; and became its lead designer — though not in charge of its gameplay systems, which were handled by lead systems designer Matt MacLean — while Josh Sawyer took over the design of &quot;Aliens: Crucible&quot;. Avellone created a new storyline for &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; that was less linear and allowed for a very large number of player choices, while reusing character designs, locations and plot points from Mitsoda&#x27;s iteration of the story. Avellone wrote most of the characters in the game, except for their emails, which were written by Matt MacLean, and except for the characters in Taipei and the peripheral ones in Rome, which were written by narrative designer Travis Stout. Avellone estimated there were approximately 120 hours of dialogue in the final game of which players would only hear between 22% and 33% in a single playthrough.

In February 2009, &quot;Aliens: Crucible&quot; was cancelled by Sega in favor of &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot;, which they deemed to be much farther along in development. After a round of layoffs at Obsidian, Urquhart began talking to Todd Vaughn, the vice president of development at Bethesda Softworks, about making a game for them, as Vaughn had previously raised that possibility as early as 2004, but Obsidian had never had any free teams whenever it had come up. Bethesda, who had obtained the rights to make &quot;Fallout&quot; games in 2004 during Interplay&#x27;s bankruptcy and had released their own &quot;Fallout 3&quot; in October 2008, were now busy developing &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; and would not be able to make a &quot;Fallout 4&quot; for a long time, which made them interested in having an external studio develop another &quot;Fallout&quot; title in the interim to avoid a large gap between titles. Obsidian were thus asked by Bethesda to pick an interesting location in the Western United States and pitch a &quot;Fallout&quot; game around it. After multiple people at Obsidian independently chose Las Vegas as a signature western city, Avellone wrote a story pitch about a stranger getting shot in the head and dropped in a shallow grave in the desert, with Vegas visible in the distance. Bethesda approved it, signing up on the development of &quot;&quot;, with the &quot;Aliens: Crucible&quot; team being transferred to it and Sawyer becoming the game&#x27;s project director and lead designer. As Sawyer had taken part in Avellone&#x27;s &quot;Van Buren&quot; pen and paper campaigns at Black Isle and had become the lead designer on that game for its final six months, he incorporated certain elements from it into &quot;New Vegas&quot;, such as Hoover Dam as a plot-important location, the Caesar&#x27;s Legion tribal confederation as a major faction, the mentally ill Nightkin super mutants as occasionally encountered characters and the caravan wars as part of the story&#x27;s background.

Avellone moved over from &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; to the &quot;New Vegas&quot; team as a senior designer in October 2009. &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot;, which had originally been meant to be released that same month, was delayed to May 2010 after management at Sega decided it would have a more favorable release window then, but the game did not receive any additional development time during the delay. Upon its release, &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; received lukewarm reviews, with frequent criticisms about its gameplay being clunky and bland, while its storytelling and freedom of choice were praised. Although Avellone had many ideas for a sequel and wanted to have an even more complex story in it, the game was not financially successful and Sega was not interested in turning it into a series. The game has, however, become regarded as a cult classic because of its unique style of reactivity.

For &quot;New Vegas&quot;, Avellone wrote two companions: Ulysses, a former scout from Caesar&#x27;s Legion who was supposed to provide insight into the game&#x27;s events from the perspective of that faction, and Rose of Sharon Cassidy, the hard-drinking caravaneer daughter of Cassidy, a &quot;Fallout 2&quot; companion who had also been written by Avellone and had been Sawyer&#x27;s favorite companion in the series. Avellone also provided writing for the game&#x27;s ending slides, the endgame characters Legate Lanius and General Oliver, as well as for the Mojave Outpost and the REPCONN Headquarters areas, and helped lead writer John Gonzalez with structuring the story and its associated character dialogues, as Gonzalez was not used to writing branching narratives. After getting Dark Horse in touch with Bethesda, Avellone also wrote &quot;All Roads&quot;, a graphic novel included with the collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;New Vegas&quot; that detailed the events leading up to the beginning of the game. However, as development on &quot;New Vegas&quot; was nearing the end, it was realized that Ulysses as a companion had so much dialogue that it would not have fit on the game&#x27;s disc and there was not enough time to trim it down, which led to his complete removal, a difficult task in itself given that his dialogue had so many different hooks into the storyline. Avellone decided instead to reuse the character as an overarching antagonist in the downloadable content expansions that were planned, with foreshadowing about his new story being added to the base game. New Vegas was released in October 2010 and was well-reviewed, but received significant criticism for its technical issues. With the passing of time, it has become regarded as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.

&quot;New Vegas&quot; received four downloadable content expansions, with Avellone being the project director and lead designer on three of them: &quot;Dead Money&quot;, &quot;Old World Blues&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Road&quot;. Avellone shared writing duties on &quot;Old World Blues&quot; with Travis Stout, but did almost all of the writing on the other two. &quot;In Dead Money&quot;, the story revolved around the player character being kidnapped, fitted with an explosive collar and forced to rob an impenetrable casino with the help of three other characters in the same predicament. Avellone sought to create a survival horror experience for it based on an idea he had originally had while working on &quot;Torment&quot; after watching the 1997 film &quot;Cube&quot; and which centered on taking disparate personalities that would normally be very hostile to each other and forcing them to work together, focusing on the themes of greed and human nature. To provide a contrast to the dark atmosphere of the other expansions, &quot;Old World Blues&quot; had a much more humorous story that involved the player character being taken to the highly advanced scientific facility of Big MT, having their brain stolen, and exploring the remains of the facility to recover it. Its story was conceived around the theme of &quot;the optimistic atomic future of what might have been&quot; and the idea that the advanced technology in the &quot;Fallout&quot; setting could have saved the world if it had not been misused by its creators. &quot;Lonesome Road&quot; was inspired by the final image at the end of the original &quot;Fallout&quot; of that game&#x27;s protagonist being cast out of their home and attempted to evoke the same sense of abandonment by having the player explore an area that their character had caused devastation for in the past, with rival courier Ulysses holding them responsible for it and waiting to confront them inside. The &quot;New Vegas&quot; expansions were released between December 2010 and September 2011 and have been praised for providing &quot;some of the best sci-fi in games&quot;, with &quot;Old World Blues&quot; in particular being named one of the greatest video game expansions ever.

In early 2011, a team led by Sawyer created a demo for a project named &quot;Stormlands&quot;, a fantasy action RPG set in a world of magical storms, and pitched it to Microsoft, who decided to sign up on publishing it as they wanted to have an RPG as a launch title for the Xbox One in 2013. Meanwhile, as Avellone was finishing work on the &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot; expansions, he also began developing new pitches for the studio, including pitches to Bethesda for spin-offs to &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series, one of which would have taken place in an alternate world that the heroes of previous games had failed in saving, and which were meant to serve a similar role to &quot;New Vegas&quot; by filling in the gap between major installments, but they were not picked up.

==== Forays into crowdfunding and final projects at Obsidian ====

On the 8th of February 2012, game developer Double Fine launched a campaign on crowdfunding service Kickstarter to raise funds for a new adventure game and reached their stated goal of $400,000 in less than 8 hours, which was unprecedented at the time. This inspired Avellone to write a blog post soon after asking fans what kind of project they wanted to potentially see Obsidian launch a Kickstarter campaign around, the responses to which briefly crashed the Obsidian website after it received more traffic than it could handle, but revealed that the most requested project was a sequel to &quot;Planescape: Torment&quot;. That same month, Wizards of the Coast, who held the license for &quot;Planescape&quot;, were contacted about the possibility of providing it, but were not interested.

Former Interplay studio head Brian Fargo, who had left Interplay in early 2002 and founded another company named inXile Entertainment later that year, was also inspired by Double Fine&#x27;s success and decided to use Kickstarter to crowdfund &quot;Wasteland 2&quot;, the sequel to the 1988 post-apocalyptic RPG &quot;Wasteland&quot; on which he had been the game director, announcing his decision to do so on the 15th of February. Aware that &quot;Wasteland&quot; had been one of Avellone&#x27;s favorite games, Fargo initially contacted him asking him to provide a promotional quote for the Kickstarter campaign, which resulted in Avellone writing a blog post in support of it on the 21st of February. Shortly afterwards, Fargo asked him if he was interested in working on the game, to which Avellone replied that he was, leading to an arrangement between Fargo and Urquhart whereby Obsidian would be paid for Avellone&#x27;s participation on it.

On the 12th of March 2012, &quot;Stormlands&quot; was cancelled, as Obsidian&#x27;s vision for the project had become increasingly disconnected from Microsoft&#x27;s demands for it. The following day, the largest round of layoffs in Obsidian&#x27;s history took place, with around 40 employees losing their jobs and company morale reaching its lowest point since the company&#x27;s inception.

That same day, the Kickstarter campaign for &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; was launched and surpassed its original target of $900,000 in only 48 hours. By the end of the month, when it had reached $1.7 million in pledges, it was announced that Avellone would be joining its development team if a new stretch goal of $2.1 million was reached, although Avellone had been unaware when agreeing to his participation that it would be tied to a stretch goal. The campaign ultimately raised slightly over $3 million. Avellone spent around 2 days a week at inXile over the following months and his contributions to the game consisted in writing its vision document and in doing area design for Highpool and the Agricultural Center, along with a few other areas such as the Synth Refinery and Seal Beach that were not included in the final game, as well as providing templates and design formats for the other designers and taking part in story meetings.

Meanwhile, at Obsidian, it was estimated that the company could only keep operating until September, which led to frantic attempts to pitch new games to publishers throughout a period that was later known at the company as the &quot;Summer of Proposals&quot;. Ten different games were pitched, including a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; game resembling &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; that was named &quot;Star Wars: Dark Times&quot; and was based on a story written by Avellone that would have taken place between &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope&quot;. However, none of Obsidian&#x27;s pitches were picked up by publishers.

As a result of the pressure, a Kickstarter campaign around a spiritual successor to &quot;Torment&quot; that did not take place in the &quot;Planescape&quot; setting was considered at Obsidian, and Avellone publicly began expressing interest in one in July 2012. However, after further discussions, a decision was made to instead create a game combining elements from all of the Infinity Engine titles, but with a more traditional fantasy setting inspired by the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. The resulting game concept was called &quot;Project Eternity&quot; and, on the 12th of September 2012, a Kickstarter campaign was launched for it, with an initial funding target of $1.1 million that was reached in just over 24 hours. By the end of the campaign on the 16th of October, it had raised over $3.9 million, the most money ever raised by a video game on Kickstarter at that time.

On the 27th of November 2012, Brian Fargo acquired the recently expired trademark for the word &quot;Torment&quot;, later stating that he had waited patiently for someone to do something with it, but had decided to step in himself and put together a team at inXile to create a similar game to &quot;Planescape: Torment&quot;, albeit without the &quot;Planescape&quot; license. Once he had the trademark, Fargo asked Avellone to work on the new game, but Avellone&#x27;s responsibilities on &quot;Project Eternity&quot; made it infeasible to do so. In January 2013, it was announced that the game would be called &quot;&quot;. On the 6th of March 2013, a Kickstarter campaign was launched for it, with an endorsement from Avellone and an initial funding goal of $900,000 that was reached after just 6 hours, although there was some disappointment among fans that Avellone would not be involved in the game. In the middle of March, however, discussions between Fargo and Urquhart led to an agreement on a workload for Avellone on &quot;Numenera&quot; that would not negatively impact &quot;Project Eternity&quot;. On the 22nd of March, at which point the &quot;Numenera&quot; campaign had $2.9 million in funding, it was announced that Avellone would be joining the game&#x27;s team if a further stretch goal of $3.5 million was reached, with his role consisting of reviewing and providing feedback on the story, characters and areas, as well as writing one of the companions. The campaign passed that goal on the 3rd of April, which led to Avellone being referred to as a &quot;human stretch goal&quot; by the gaming press from then on, and ended on the 6th of April with a final tally of $4.18 million, overtaking &quot;Project Eternity&quot; to become the highest-funded game on the platform. Avellone created eight different concepts for a companion character, wishing to only settle on one after sufficiently exploring the game&#x27;s plot and themes, and ultimately chose to write Erritis, an impulsive warrior with a love for danger who was meant to introduce some levity to what Avellone regarded as &quot;an otherwise dark and frightening world.&quot;

During a trip to London for a game writers&#x27; meetup, Avellone began talking to Tom Jubert, the narrative designer for indie developer Subset Games&#x27; science fiction roguelike game &quot;&quot;. Upon discovering who Jubert was, Avellone expressed his appreciation for &quot;FTL&quot; and offered to write for it. As a result, a few weeks later, Avellone was given the opportunity to do so by Justin Ma and Matthew Davis, the founders of Subset Games, scripting a large number of encounters for &quot;FTL: Advanced Edition&quot;, an expanded version of the game, around the end of 2013 and being credited as a guest writer on it. The &quot;Advanced Edition&quot; was released in April 2014.

In December 2013, &quot;Project Eternity&quot; was renamed into &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot;. For &quot;Pillars&quot;, Avellone provided feedback on the story and wrote two companions: Durance, a cynical priest betrayed by his own god, and the Grieving Mother, a cipher with the ability to draw energy from her soul and mind who used her talents as a midwife but was forced to flee her community after hiding the fact that the children in it were being born without souls. Both characters have been regarded as fan favorites, although a significant part of the content Avellone designed for them, such as sequences where the player entered their subconscious to explore their shared past and understand how to affect their present personalities, did not make it into the final game.

At the beginning of 2014, publisher Paradox Interactive signed up on Obsidian&#x27;s development of &quot;Tyranny&quot;, a fantasy RPG using the same engine as &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; that took place in an Iron Age world in which, after an epic struggle between good and evil, evil had won. Avellone was originally the game&#x27;s creative lead and worked on it throughout its pre-production period. His goals for the title included having a protagonist tasked with restoring order to a conquered area for the forces of evil but provided with the option of rebelling against them, as well as an open world structure where any kind of activity, such as exploring dungeons or doing quests for factions, would cause the story to progress. &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; was released at the end of March 2015, which freed up development resources and led to &quot;Tyranny&quot; entering full production. However, after a series of disagreements with some of Obsidian&#x27;s other co-founders about the company&#x27;s management practices, Avellone left Obsidian in June 2015. &quot;Tyranny&quot;&#x27;s game director Brian Heins later noted that concepts, characters and ideas from Avellone&#x27;s work on the game had been retained.

=== 2015-present: Freelance writing and design ===
After departing Obsidian, Avellone quickly became an in-demand freelance writer and designer, working on multiple games for different companies at any given time and seeking experience in a variety of genres in order to improve his craft.

Some months prior, Avellone had been asked by Raphaël Colantonio, the founder of Arkane Studios and a fan of his work, if he could write for Arkane&#x27;s new first person science-fiction title, later known as &quot;Prey&quot;, but Avellone had replied that his full-time position at Obsidian did not allow him to do so. However, upon going freelance, Avellone contacted Colantonio to ask if the offer was still open and found that it was. The two of them initially met up at E3 2015 to discuss the project, after which Avellone flew out to Arkane&#x27;s studio in Austin, Texas, where he was shown the game and taken through its critical path storyline before being asked to try his hand at writing two of the side characters. Lead designer Ricardo Bare was impressed by the result and Avellone joined the team, writing several of the game&#x27;s major characters, including neuroscientist Dayo Igwe and chief systems engineer Mikhaila Ilyushin, as well as many of the side ones and their associated quests, while also offering feedback and insights into the story in general and contributing to the game&#x27;s lore and alternate history.

Also in June 2015, inXile launched a Kickstarter campaign for &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot;, which was billed as a proper sequel to Interplay&#x27;s &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; trilogy from the 1980s, and it reached its funding goal of $1.25 million in 12 days. On the 29th of June, with 11 days remaining, it was announced that Avellone would be joining the game&#x27;s team if its campaign surpassed $1.9 million in funding and that he would design a deadly dungeon named the Cairn of Horrors for it, but this goal was not reached.

On the 12th of August 2015, Larian Studios announced they would be launching a Kickstarter campaign for the turn-based tactical RPG &quot;&quot; at the end of the month and asked their community to vote on what reward tiers they wanted to see in it, but many fans reacted by voting for potential stretch goals instead, with Avellone&#x27;s addition to the team being one of the most requested. This resulted in Larian CEO Swen Vincke meeting up with Avellone at PAX Prime 2015 to discuss the possibility of his involvement. On the 25th of September, it was announced that Avellone would be working on the game, although not as part of a stretch goal. As a senior writer, he was responsible for doing story and companion reviews and also designed and wrote the backstory for the undead playable character and recruitable companion Fane.

Avellone finished his work on Prey in early 2017. On the 8th of February 2017, Italian game developer Gamera Interactive announced the isometric action-RPG &quot;Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms&quot;, with Avellone as a creative consultant working on the lore, world design and character backstories for the game. Alaloth was an unusually art-centric project from Avellone&#x27;s perspective, as a lot of concept art had already been created for the characters in the game and he was tasked with using it as a starting point for writing deeper stories around them.

On the 10th of February 2017, Subset Games announced the turn-based strategy game &quot;Into the Breach&quot;, as well as Avellone&#x27;s involvement in writing and world-building for it. The game depicted the conflict between human civilization and giant insectile aliens, with the player controlling time-traveling mechs attempting to save the remnants of humanity across multiple timelines. Avellone designed the varied personalities of the mech pilots, giving them many different reactions to gameplay situations, as well as fleshing out the lore of the corporations in the game and writing the dialogues of their CEOs. Its storytelling, though minimalist, was praised by game journalists, with Kotaku describing it as &quot;full of interesting plot possibilities when it comes to time travel and universe jumping, and where exactly, from a sci-fi point of view, the two meet&quot; and Rock Paper Shotgun noting that &quot;its short lines drip with implication about the rules of time travel, parallel realities and the motivations and peccadilloes of its pilots&quot;.

On the 17th of May 2017, Owlcat Games announced &quot;&quot;, the first computer RPG based on the universe of the tabletop &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot;, an offshoot of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; from game publisher Paizo, and also announced that Avellone would be contributing narrative design to the title. Owlcat had already secured the budget to make the game, but they launched a Kickstarter campaign at the beginning of June to increase it and allow for more companions, areas and quests to be included, successfully reaching their goal of $500k on the 26th of June and ending up with a final tally of $909k two weeks later. Although &quot;Kingmaker&quot; was based on an eponymous series of adventure modules for &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, Avellone helped the studio expand its story so it would have enough new content for people who had played the original tabletop version of it. He also wrote one of the companions — the goblin rogue Nok-Nok — from start to finish, worked with the other designers on setting up the quest arcs for companions across the game, and assisted with the writing and editing of a large number of characters.

In July 2017, Green Tree Games announced a tactical leadership World War II RPG titled &quot;Burden of Command&quot;, bringing Avellone in as a senior advisor tasked with guiding the developers on &quot;creating empathy, memorable characters, and compelling narrative arcs&quot;. Avellone noted that, in a shift from other World War II games, &quot;Burden of Command&quot; would focus on dealing with the emotional pressure of being in command and having to accomplish your mission while also protecting your soldiers.

In June 2018, publisher Electronic Arts announced &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&quot;, an action-adventure game developed by Respawn Entertainment. In March 2019, Avellone revealed that he had recently finished up his work on it, which consisted of story contributions, story and character reviews and the writing of certain cinematic scripts. Avellone was thrilled to work on &quot;Star Wars&quot; again and noted that he appreciated the game&#x27;s story taking place after &quot;Episode III&quot;, as that timeframe provided a lot of potential for drama and conflict.

In December 2018, Norwegian game developer Moondrop Studios announced that Avellone had written the story for its upcoming cooperative puzzle platformer &quot;Degrees of Separation&quot;, a game following two characters, Ember and Rime, the former from a world of warmth and light and the latter from a world of cold and darkness, who use their contrasting powers to overcome obstacles together. Having never worked on a platformer before, Avellone saw it as a chance to stretch his writing skills further, and was also intrigued by the ways in which the gameplay mechanics were meant to reflect changes in the relationship between the two characters, with them building bridges when supportive of each other and later having explosive powers when arguing with each other.

In December 2019, Owlcat announced &quot;&quot;, their second &quot;Pathfinder&quot; game, once again having Avellone involved as a narrative designer. Several days later, Avellone revealed that he had also been working on the action role-playing game &quot;Weird West&quot;, the first game from Raphaël Colantonio&#x27;s new company WolfEye Studios.

=== Misconduct accusations and retraction ===
In June 2020, Avellone was accused by two people of using his status for sexual misconduct and harassment towards women during industry conventions. Following these allegations, Techland announced that they and Avellone agreed to end his work on &quot;Dying Light 2&quot;. Gato Studios also removed Avellone from &quot;The Waylanders&quot;; according to lead writer Emily Grace Buck, Avellone had &quot;very little writing&quot; over that project, having only penned a few quests that they planned to rewrite. Paradox Interactive said that while Avellone had worked on an early version of &quot;&quot;, much of his work had since been overwritten.

Avellone published a denial of the allegations through &quot;Medium&quot; in June 2021 and stated he had filed a libel suit against two accusers in a California court. This libel suit was settled in March 2023, with a settlement that &quot;provides for a seven-figure payment&quot; from the accusers to Avellone. Concurrently the two accusers retracted their original accusations, stating that &quot;Mr. Avellone never sexually abused either of us,&quot; and that &quot;We have no knowledge that he has ever sexually abused any women.&quot; They also claimed in the same statement that their previous public statements with regards to Avellone had been &quot;misinterpreted&quot;.

<doc id="648216" wikidata="Q949228" url="?curid=648216" title="Sholay">
<text>Sholay (, ) is a 1975 Indian Hindi-language action-adventure film directed by Ramesh Sippy, produced by his father G. P. Sippy, and written by Salim–Javed. The film is about two criminals, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan), hired by a retired police officer (Sanjeev Kumar) to capture the ruthless dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri also star, as Veeru and Jai&#x27;s love interests, Basanti and Radha, respectively. The music was composed by R D Burman.

The film was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the southern state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years, beginning in October 1973. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, &quot;Sholay&quot; was released as a 198-minute long film. In 1990, the original director&#x27;s cut of 204 minutes became available on home media. When first released, &quot;Sholay&quot; received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai&#x27;s Minerva theatre. The film was also an overseas success in the Soviet Union. It was the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time, and was the highest-grossing film in India up until &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994). By numerous accounts, &quot;Sholay&quot; remains one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time, adjusted for inflation.

&quot;Sholay&quot; is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential Indian films of all time. It was ranked first in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2002 poll of &quot;Top 10 Indian Films&quot; of all time. In 2005, the judges of the 50th Filmfare Awards named it the Best Film of 50 Years. The film is a Dacoit Western (sometimes called a &quot;Curry Western&quot;), combining the conventions of Indian dacoit films with that of Spaghetti Westerns along with elements of Samurai cinema. &quot;Sholay&quot; is also a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film&#x27;s role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film&#x27;s dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India&#x27;s daily vernacular. In January 2014, &quot;Sholay&quot; was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.

== Plot ==
Jai and Veeru are small-time crooks who are released from prison, where they are recruited by a former Inspector Thakur Baldev Singh to capture a notorious dacoit named Gabbar Singh wanted for , as the duo had saved Thakur from a train robbery which makes Thakur to recruit them for the mission with an additional reward. The duo leave for Thakur&#x27;s village in Ramgarh, where Gabbar is residing and terrorizing the villagers.

After reaching Ramgarh, Veeru falls for Basanti, a feisty talkative horse-cart driver. Jai meets Thakur&#x27;s widowed daughter-in-law Radha and falls for her, who later reciprocates his feelings. The two thwart Gabbar&#x27;s dacoits, who came to extort money. During the festival of Holi, Gabbar&#x27;s gang attacks the villagers where they corner Jai and Veeru, but the duo manage to attack and chase them away from the village. The duo are upset at Thakur&#x27;s inaction (when Jai and Veeru were cornered, Thakur had a gun within his reach, but did not help them) and consider calling off the mission. Thakur reveals that a few years ago, Gabbar had killed his family members (except Radha and Ramlal), and had both his arms cut off; he concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl, which was the sole reason he could not use the gun.

Seeing how much Thakur has suffered, Jai and Veeru took pity by taking an oath that they will capture Gabbar alive, free of charge. After learning the duo&#x27;s heroics, Gabbar kills the local imam Rahim Chacha&#x27;s son Ahmed, all to threaten the villagers to make Jai and Veeru surrender to him. The villagers refuse and instead get the duo to kill a few of Gabbar&#x27;s henchmen in revenge for the boy&#x27;s death. Gabbar angrily retaliates by having his men capture Veeru and Basanti. Jai arrives and attacks the hideout, where the trio are able to flee Gabbar&#x27;s hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Shooting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Unaware that Jai was wounded in the gunfight, Veeru is forced to leave for more ammunition and also to drop Basanti at a safe place.

Jai sacrifices himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range, killing Gabbar&#x27;s men. Veeru returns, and Jai dies, leaving Radha and Veeru devastated. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar&#x27;s den and kills his remaining men where he catches Gabbar and nearly beats him to death. Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the vow to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his spike-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and his hands. The police arrive and arrest Gabbar for his crimes. After Jai&#x27;s funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train.

=== Development ===
The screenwriter pair Salim–Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, began narrating the idea for &quot;Sholay&quot; as a four-line snippet to filmmakers in 1973. The idea was rejected by two producer/director teams, including directors Manmohan Desai and Prakash Mehra. About six months after the release of &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973), Salim-Javed contacted G. P. Sippy and his son Ramesh Sippy, and narrated the four-line snippet to them. Ramesh Sippy liked the concept of &quot;Sholay&quot; and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge the murder of his family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that it would be difficult to get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances. The film&#x27;s script and dialogues are in Hindustani; Salim-Javed wrote the dialogues in Urdu script, which was then transcribed by an assistant into Devanagari script so that Hindi readers could read the Urdu dialogues.

The film&#x27;s plot was loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1954 samurai cinema film, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. &quot;Sholay&quot; is a defining example of the Dacoit Western film, combining the conventions of Indian dacoit films, especially Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957) and the Dilip Kumar and Nitin Bose film &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961), with that of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone&#x27;s Spaghetti Westerns such as &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968) as well as &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960). It also has some plot elements borrowed from the Indian films &quot;Mera Gaon Mera Desh&quot; (1971) and &quot;Khote Sikkay&quot; (1973). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot;, and has also been compared to a similar scene in &quot;North West Frontier&quot; (1959). A scene showing the massacre of Thakur&#x27;s family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. &quot;Sholay&quot; may have also been influenced by Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s Westerns, such as &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969) and &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973), and George Roy Hill&#x27;s &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969).

The character Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit Gabbar Singh Gujjar who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by Gujjar had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen. The fictional Gabbar was also influenced by larger-than-life characters in Pakistani author Ibn-e-Safi&#x27;s Urdu novels, Dilip Kumar&#x27;s dacoit character Gunga from the film &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; who speaks with a similar mixed Khariboli and Awadhi dialect, and villains from Sergio Leone&#x27;s films. Sippy wanted to do away with the clichéd idea of a man becoming a dacoit due to societal issues, as was the case in other films, and focused on Gabbar being an emblem of pure evil. To emphasise the point of Gabbar being a new type of villain, Sippy avoided the typical tropes of dacoits wearing dhotis and pagris and sporting a tika and worshipping &quot;Ma Bhavani&quot;; Gabbar would be wearing army fatigues. The character of the jailer, played by Asrani was influenced by Adolf Hitler. Javed Akhtar brought a book on World War II which had several pictures of Hitler posing to set the typical posture of the character in the film. Asrani spiced up his character with some ideas about Hitler&#x27;s speech delivery he had heard from a teacher in FTII. The trademark &#x27;Ha Ha&#x27; at the end of his monologues was inspired by a similar performance by Jack Lemmon in &quot;The Great Race&quot;. Soorma Bhopali, a minor comic relief character, was based on an acquaintance of actor Jagdeep, a forest officer from Bhopal named Soorma. The real-life Soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter. The main characters&#x27; names, Jai and Veeru, mean &quot;victory&quot; and &quot;heroism&quot; in Hindi.

=== Casting ===
The producers considered Danny Denzongpa for the role of Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan&#x27;s &quot;Dharmatma&quot; (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book &quot;Abhishapta Chambal&quot;, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but Salim-Javed &quot;felt he had the audience&#x27;s sympathy through roles he&#x27;d done before; Gabbar had to be completely hateful.&quot;

Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not very popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself. He was cast after Salim-Javed recommended him for &quot;Sholay&quot; in 1973; Bachchan&#x27;s performance in their first collaboration, &quot;Zanjeer&quot;, convinced Salim-Javed he was the right actor for the part. Salim-Javed were also impressed with Bachchan&#x27;s performance in &quot;Raaste Kaa Patthar&quot; (1972), and at Bachchan&#x27;s request, Dharmendra had personally put in a word for him. All these factors ensured that the role was Bachchan&#x27;s.

As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered for the role of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Salim-Javed approached Dilip Kumar to play Thakur&#x27;s role, but he turned down the offer; Dilip Kumar later said it was one of the few films he regretted turning down. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested to play the role of Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would thus be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Malini was reluctant to play the role of a &quot;tangewali&quot;, more so after Sippy told her that the film belongs to Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan, but she trusted Sippy to give her a meaty role, given that he had played a huge role in essaying her stardom through their previous collaborations.

During the film&#x27;s production, four of the leads became romantically involved. Bachchan married Bhaduri four months before filming started. This led to shooting delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By the time the film released, she was pregnant with their son Abhishek. Dharmendra had begun courting Malini during their earlier film &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot; (1972), also directed by Sippy, and used the location shoot of &quot;Sholay&quot; to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes which would allow him to spend more time with her. The couple married five years after the film&#x27;s release.

=== Filming ===
Much of &quot;Sholay&quot; was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, a town near Bangalore, Karnataka. The filmmakers had to build a road from the Bangalore highway to Ramanagara for convenient access to the sets. Art director Ram Yedekar had an entire township built on the site. A prison set was constructed near Rajkamal Studios in Bombay, also outdoors, to match the natural lighting of the on-location sets. One part of Ramanagara was for a time called &quot;Sippy Nagar&quot; as a tribute to the director of the film. , a visit to the &quot;Sholay rocks&quot; (where much of the film was shot) was still being offered to tourists travelling through Ramanagara.

Filming began on location on 3 October 1973, with a scene featuring Bachchan and Bhaduri. The film had a lavish production for its time (with frequent banquets and parties for the cast), took two and a half years to make, and went over budget. One reason for its high cost was that Sippy re-filmed scenes many times to get his desired effect. &quot;Yeh Dosti&quot;, a 5-minute song sequence, took 21 days to shoot, two short scenes in which Radha lights lamps took 20 days to film because of lighting problems, and the shooting of the scene in which Gabbar kills the imam&#x27;s son lasted 19 days. The train robbery sequence, shot on the Bombay–Poona railway route near Panvel, took more than 7 weeks to complete.

&quot;Sholay&quot; was the first Indian film to have a stereophonic soundtrack and to use the 70 mm widescreen format. However, since actual 70 mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35 mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, &quot;A 70 mm &quot;[sic]&quot; format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger, but since I also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator.&quot; The use of 70 mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: &quot;The greatest star cast ever assembled – the greatest story ever told&quot;.

=== Alternate version ===
The director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Sholay&quot; has a different ending in which Thakur kicks Gabbar onto a nail on one of the two poles that Gabbar had used to chain Thakur when he had cut off his arms, stabbing him in the back and killing him, along with some additional violent scenes. Thakur&#x27;s shoe soles getting armed with spikes, Gabbar&#x27;s death scene, and the scene in which the imam&#x27;s son is killed, were cut from the film by India&#x27;s Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur&#x27;s family is massacred. The Censor Board was concerned about the violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director&#x27;s cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204 minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198 minutes long.

== Themes and interpretations ==
Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film&#x27;s role as a national allegory.

Koushik Banerjea, a sociologist in the London School of Economics, notes that &quot;Sholay&quot; exhibits a &quot;sympathetic construction of &#x27;rogue&#x27; masculinity&quot; exemplified by the likeable outlaws Jai and Veeru. Banerjea argues during the film, the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes. Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought &quot;a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order&quot; to Indian cinema. Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society. Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru&#x27;s criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order. Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh.

Gabbar Singh, the film&#x27;s antagonist, was well received by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience&#x27;s attention as an object of male fetish, in &quot;Sholay&quot;, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that &quot;Sholay&quot; can be viewed as a national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of &quot;Sholay&quot;, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.

Dissanayeke and Sahai note that, although the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully &quot;Indianised&quot;. As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in &quot;Sholay&quot; with a similar scene in &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. Although both films were similar in technical style, &quot;Sholay&quot; emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach. Maithili Rao, in &quot;Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema&quot;, notes that &quot;Sholay&quot; infuses the style of the Western genre into a &quot;feudalistic ethos&quot;. Ted Shen of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; notes &quot;Sholay&quot;″s &quot;hysterical visual style&quot; and intermittent &quot;populist message&quot;. Cultural critic and Islamic scholar Ziauddin Sardar lampoons the film in his book &quot;The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema&quot;, both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers. Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam). Meanwhile, the sole function of one female character (Radha) is to suffer her fate in silence, while the other female lead (Basanti) is just a garrulous village belle.

Some scholars have indicated that &quot;Sholay&quot; contains homosocial themes. Ted Shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style. Dina Holtzman, in her book &quot;Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora&quot;, states that the death of Jai, and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads, is necessary for the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship (that of Veeru and Basanti).

== Music ==

R. D. Burman composed the film&#x27;s music, and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. The songs used in the film, and released on the original soundtrack are listed below. Following that is a list of unused tracks and dialogues which were released later on an updated soundtrack.

Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and Manna Dey performed vocals for Dharmendra, Malini and Bachchan, respectively.

The song &quot;Mehbooba Mehbooba&quot; was sung by its composer, R. D. Burman, who received his sole Filmfare Award nomination for playback singing for his effort. The song, which is often featured on Bollywood hit song compilations, is based on &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; by Greek singer Demis Roussos.

&quot;Mehbooba Mehbooba&quot; has been extensively anthologised, remixed, and recreated. A version was created in 2005 by the Kronos Quartet for their Grammy-nominated album &quot;You&#x27;ve Stolen My Heart&quot;, featuring Asha Bhosle. It was also remixed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya, along with Bhosle, in his debut acting film &quot;Aap Kaa Surroor&quot; (2007). &quot;Yeh Dosti&quot; has been called the ultimate friendship anthem. It was remixed and sung by Shankar Mahadevan and Udit Narayan for the 2010 Malayalam film &quot;Four Friends&quot;, and also in 2010 it was used to symbolise India&#x27;s friendship with the United States during a visit from President Barack Obama.

Several songs from the soundtrack were included in the annual &quot;Binaca Geetmala&quot; list of top filmi songs. &quot;Mehbooba Mehooba&quot; was listed at No. 24 on the 1975 list, and at No. 6 on the 1976 list. &quot;Koi Haseena&quot; was listed at No. 30 in 1975, and No. 20 in 1976. &quot;Yeh Dosti&quot; was listed at No. 9 in 1976. Despite the soundtrack&#x27;s success, at the time, the songs from &quot;Sholay&quot; attracted less attention than the film&#x27;s dialogue—a rarity for Hindi language films. The producers were thus prompted to release records with only dialogue. Taken together, the album sales reached an unprecedented 500,000 units. By 1979, the soundtrack went Platinum (equivalent to 1million sales at the time), becoming one of the top-selling Bollywood soundtracks of the 1970s.

Music critic Oli Marlow reviewed the soundtrack in 2013, calling it a unique fusion of religious, folk, and classical music, with influences from around the world. He also commented on the sound design of the film, calling it psychedelic, and saying that there was &quot;a lot of incredible incidental music&quot; in the film that was not included in the soundtrack releases. In a 1999 paper submitted to London&#x27;s Symposium on Sound in Cinema, film critic Shoma A. Chatterji said, &quot;&quot;Sholay&quot; offers a model lesson on how sound can be used to signify the terror a character evokes. &quot;Sholay&quot; is also exemplary in its use of soundmatching to jump cut to a different scene and time, without breaking the continuity of the narrative, yet, intensifying the drama.&quot;


== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Sholay&quot; was released on 15 August 1975, Indian Independence Day, in Bombay. Due to lackluster reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools, it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks. From the third week, however, viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth. During the initial slow period, the director and writer considered re-shooting some scenes so that Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s character would not die. When business picked up, they abandoned this idea. After being helped additionally by a soundtrack release containing dialogue snippets, &quot;Sholay&quot; soon became an &quot;overnight sensation&quot;. The film was then released in other distribution zones such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Hyderabad on 11 October 1975. It became the highest-grossing Hindi language film of 1975, and film ranking website Box Office India has given the film a verdict of &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot;.

&quot;Sholay&quot; went on to earn a still-standing record of 60 golden jubilees across India, and was the first film in India to celebrate a silver jubilee at over 100 theatres. It was shown continuously at Bombay&#x27;s Minerva theatre for over five years. &quot;Sholay&quot; was the Indian film with the longest theatrical run until &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995) broke its record of 286 weeks in 2001.

Exact figures are not available on the budget and box-office earnings of &quot;Sholay&quot;, but film trade sources provide estimates of its success. According to Box Office India, &quot;Sholay&quot; earned about in net income (valued at about US$16,778,000 in 1975) in India during its first run, which was many times its 30 million (valued at about US$3,355,000 in 1975) budget. Those earnings in India were a record that remained unbroken for nineteen years, which is also the longest amount of time that a film has held the record for being the highest grossing film in India. Its original gross was increased further with re-releases during the late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. The film&#x27;s total gross revenue in India amounted to (). Box Office India estimates the film&#x27;s total footfalls in India as over 100million tickets sold. The film was also an overseas success in the Soviet Union, where it was released in 1979. The film sold 48.4million tickets during its initial run at the Soviet box office, before eventually selling 60million tickets including re-runs. The film was also released in China, as two parts in 1988.

It was the highest-grossing Indian film ever up until &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; (1982), and the highest-grossing film in India up until &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994). In 1985, &quot;India Today&quot; estimated that the film drew a total audience of 250million over the years, which is comparable to the number of tickets sold by some of the world&#x27;s highest-grossing films of all time adjusted for inflation. It is often cited that, after adjusting the figures for inflation, &quot;Sholay&quot; remains one of the highest-grossing films in the history of Indian cinema, although such figures are not known with certainty. Box Office India estimated as &quot;Sholay&quot;&#x27;s adjusted domestic net income in 2008, while &quot;Times of India&quot; estimated over as the adjusted domestic gross in 2009. &quot;Mid-Day&quot; estimated the film&#x27;s total adjusted gross as () in 2014.

=== Critical response ===
Initial critical reviews of &quot;Sholay&quot; were negative. Among contemporary critics, K.L. Amladi of &quot;India Today&quot; called the film a &quot;dead ember&quot; and &quot;a gravely flawed attempt&quot;. &quot;Filmfare&quot; said that the film was an unsuccessful mincing of Western style with Indian milieu, making it an &quot;imitation western—neither here nor there.&quot; Others labelled it as &quot;sound and fury signifying nothing&quot; and a &quot;second-rate take-off&quot; of the 1971 film &quot;Mera Gaon Mera Desh&quot;. Trade journals and columnists initially called the film a flop. In a 1976 article in the journal &quot;Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review&quot;, author Michael Gallagher praised the technical achievement of the film, but otherwise criticised it stating, &quot;As a spectacle it breaks new ground, but on every other level it is intolerable: formless, incoherent, superficial in human image, and a somewhat nasty piece of violence&quot;.

Over time, the critical reception to &quot;Sholay&quot; greatly improved; it is now considered a classic, and among the greatest Hindi-language films. In a 2005 BBC review, the well-rounded characters and simple narrative of the film were commended, but the comical cameos of Asrani and Jagdeep were considered unnecessary. On the film&#x27;s 35th anniversary, the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; wrote that it was a &quot;trailblazer in terms of camera work as well as music,&quot; and that &quot;practically every scene, dialogue or even a small character was a highlight.&quot; In 2006, The Film Society of Lincoln Center described &quot;Sholay&quot; as &quot;an extraordinary and utterly seamless blend of adventure, comedy, music and dance&quot;, labelling it an &quot;indisputable classic&quot;. &quot;Chicago Review&quot; critic Ted Shen criticised the film in 2002 for its formulaic plot and &quot;slapdash&quot; cinematography, and noted that the film &quot;alternates between slapstick and melodrama&quot;. In their obituary of the producer G.P. Sippy, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Sholay&quot; &quot;revolutionized Hindi filmmaking and brought true professionalism to Indian script writing&quot;.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Sholay&quot; was nominated for nine Filmfare Awards, and the only winner was M. S. Shinde, who won the award for Best Editing. The film also won three awards at the 1976 Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association Awards (Hindi section): &quot;Best Actor in Supporting Role&quot; for Amjad Khan, &quot;Best Cinematographer (Colour)&quot; for Dwarka Divecha, and &quot;Best Art Director&quot; for Ram Yedekar. &quot;Sholay&quot; received a special award at the 50th Filmfare Awards in 2005: Best Film of 50 Years.
== Legacy and cultural influence ==
&quot;Sholay&quot; has received many &quot;Best Film&quot; honours. It was declared the &quot;Film of the Millennium&quot; by BBC India in 1999. It topped the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Indian Films&quot; of all time poll of 2002, and was voted the greatest Indian movie in a Sky Digital poll of one million British Indians in 2004. It was also included in the magazine &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;Best of Bollywood&quot; list in 2010, and in IBN Live&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 greatest Indian films of all time&quot; in 2013. In 2023, Time Out ranked it #1 on its list of the &quot;100 Best Bollywood Movies.&quot;

&quot;Sholay&quot; inspired many films and pastiches, and spawned a genre of films, the &quot;Curry Western&quot;, which is a play on the term Spaghetti Western. A more accurate label for the genre is the Dacoit Western, due to its roots in earlier Indian dacoit films such as &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957) and &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961). It was also an early and most definitive masala film, and a trend-setter for &quot;multi-star&quot; films. The film was a watershed for scriptwriters in Hindi language films, who were not paid well before &quot;Sholay&quot;; after the film&#x27;s success, its writing duo Salim-Javed became stars in their own right and script writing became a more respected profession. The BBC has described &quot;Sholay&quot; as the &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; of Bollywood&quot;, comparing its impact on Hindi language films to the impact that &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) later had on Hollywood, while comparing Gabbar Singh to Darth Vader.

Certain scenes and dialogues from the film earned iconic status in India, such as &quot;&quot;Kitne aadmi the&quot; (How many men were there?), &quot;Jo dar gaya, samjho mar gaya&quot; (One who is scared is dead), and &quot;Bahut yaarana laagta hai&quot;&quot; (Looks like you two are very close) – all dialogues of Gabbar Singh. These and other popular dialogues entered the people&#x27;s daily vernacular. Characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture. Gabbar Singh, the sadistic villain, ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by &quot;seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains&quot;, who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story, such as Shakal (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) of &quot;Shaan&quot; (1980), Mogambo (Amrish Puri) of &quot;Mr. India&quot; (1987) and Bhujang (Amrish Puri) of &quot;Tridev&quot; (1989). &quot;Filmfare&quot;, in 2013, named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema, and four actors were included in its 2010 list of &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot; for their work in this film.

The film is often credited with making Amitabh Bachchan a &quot;superstar&quot;, two years after he became a star with &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973). Some of the supporting actors remained etched in public memory as the characters they played in &quot;Sholay&quot;; for example, Mac Mohan continued to be referred to as &quot;Sambha&quot;, even though his character had just one line. Major and minor characters continue to be used in commercials, promos, films and sitcoms. Amjad Khan acted in many villainous roles later in his career. He also played Gabbar Singh again in the 1991 spoof &quot;Ramgarh Ke Sholay&quot;, and reprised the role in commercials. The British Film Institute in 2002 wrote that fear of Gabbar Singh &quot;is still invoked by mothers to put their children to sleep&quot;. The 2012 film &quot;Gabbar Singh&quot;, named after the character, became the highest-grossing Telugu film up to that point. Comedian Jagdeep, who played Soorma Bhopali in the film, attempted to use his &quot;Sholay&quot; success to create a spinoff. He directed and played the lead role in the 1988 film &quot;Soorma Bhopali&quot;, in which Dharmendra and Bachchan had cameos.

&quot;Sholay&quot; was remade in Bangladesh as &quot;Dost Dushman&quot; (1977), becoming the first Dhallywood film to portray a number of lengthy action scenes, was condemned by many film critics for &#x27;bringing violence&#x27; to the cinema screen in the country. In 2004, &quot;Sholay&quot; was digitally remastered and shown again to packed theatres in India, including Mumbai&#x27;s Minerva, where it had run successfully 29 years earlier. Another attempt to remake &quot;Sholay&quot;, Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s film &quot;Aag&quot; (2007), starring Amitabh Bachchan as the villain, was a commercial and critical disaster. Because of television and home media, &quot;Sholay&quot; is widely available and still popular. Twenty years after its release, &quot;Sholay&quot; was first shown on the Indian DD National television channel, where it drew the highest ratings ever for an Indian film broadcast. Video game producer Mobile2win released the &quot;Sholay Ramgarh Express&quot; game for mobile phones in 2004, along with other &quot;Sholay&quot; themed content such as wallpapers, video clips, and ringtones; another video game &quot;Sholay: Bullets of Justice&quot; developed by Gameshastra has also been released. &quot;Sholay Adventures&quot;, a 2014 Indian animated television film adaptation of &quot;Sholay&quot; aired on Pogo TV. In 2019, a film titled &quot;The Sholay Girl&quot;, based on the stunt woman Reshma Pathan, was released. Pathan had worked as the body double for Malini in the film.

&quot;Sholay&quot; has been the subject of two books and many articles. Wimal Dissanayake and Malti Sahai&#x27;s &quot;Sholay, A Cultural Reading&quot; (1992) attempts a comprehensive scholarly study that sets the film within the broader history of popular cinema in India. Anupama Chopra&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2000) provides an inside look at the film&#x27;s production based on interviews with the director, stars, and crew members.

&quot;Sholay&quot; has been labelled by Chopra as the gold standard in Indian cinema, and a reference point for audiences and trade analysts. Over the years, the film has reached a mythic stature in popular culture, and has been called the greatest Hindi film of all time. It belongs to only a small collection of films, including &quot;Kismet&quot; (1943), &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960) and &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994), which are repeatedly watched throughout India, and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance. The lasting effect of &quot;Sholay&quot; on Indian cinema was summarised by Anupama Chopra, when in 2004 she called it &quot;no longer just a film, [but] an event&quot;. In the 2000 book &quot;Sholay: The Making of a Classic&quot;, the noted director Shekhar Kapur stated &quot;there has never been a more defining film on the Indian screen. Indian film history can be divided into &quot;Sholay&quot; BC and &quot;Sholay&quot; AD&quot;. The film was jointly released in Pakistan by Geo films and Mandviwalla Entertainment on 17 April 2015, almost 40 years after its theatrical release. The film&#x27;s premiere in the country was held in Karachi.

Screenwriter V. Vijayendra Prasad, responsible for a number of blockbusters in the early 21st century, including the South Indian franchise &quot;Baahubali&quot; and the Hindi film &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; (starring Salim&#x27;s son Salman Khan), cited &quot;Sholay&quot; as a major inspiration on his work.

== 3D re-release ==
Filmmaker Ketan Mehta&#x27;s company Maya Digital was responsible for converting &quot;Sholay&quot; into the 3D format. Mehta was approached by G. P. Sippy&#x27;s grandson, Sasha Sippy, about the project in 2010. In March 2012, Shaan Uttam Singh, the grandson of producer G. P. Sippy, said that he would sponsor a conversion of the film to 3D, and release it in late 2012; this was later postponed to late 2013, and eventually finalised for 3 January 2014. It took to convert &quot;Sholay&quot; to 3D.

Under the leadership of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth. New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter in the direction of the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar&#x27;s hideout in the caves.

The theatrical trailer and release date were unveiled by the original script-writers Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. The two original leads, Bachchan and Dharmendra, were also involved in promoting the re-release. The film was released in 1,000 screens in India, and additional screens overseas. It earned approximately during its re-release, becomes the third highest grossing re-released Indian film of all time.

<text>East Tennessee State University (ETSU) is a public research university in Johnson City, Tennessee. It was historically part of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee under the Tennessee Board of Regents, but since 2016, the university has been transitioning to governance by its own board of trustees. , it is the fourth largest university in the state and has off-campus centers in nearby Kingsport, Elizabethton, and Sevierville.

ETSU is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It hosts the James H. Quillen College of Medicine which is often ranked as one of the top schools in the United States for rural medicine and primary care education; the Bill Gatton College of Pharmacy, the College of Nursing, the College of Public Health, and the recently formed College of Clinical and Rehabilitative Health Sciences. Unique programs include an accredited program in Bluegrass, Old Time, and Country Music, America&#x27;s lone master&#x27;s degree in Storytelling, and the Appalachian Studies programs, focused on the surrounding Appalachian region.

==History==
ETSU was founded as East Tennessee State Normal School in 1911 to educate teachers; the K-12 training school, called University School, operates to this day. East Tennessee State officially became a college in 1925 when it changed its name to East Tennessee State Teachers College, subsequently gaining accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1927. By 1930, the school&#x27;s name had changed again to East Tennessee State Teacher&#x27;s College, Johnson City. In 1943, East Tennessee State Teacher&#x27;s College was expanded into a college with a range of liberal arts offerings, becoming East Tennessee State College. The college became East Tennessee State University in 1963, adopting the name it holds today. In 1973, Shelbridge became the president&#x27;s official residence.

ETSU announced plans to open a College of Pharmacy in 2005, rapidly receiving local support to secure the approval. Full accreditation was granted in June 2010, shortly after the first class of the Bill Gatton College of Pharmacy graduated.

In late 2009, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission and the Tennessee Board of Regents authorized the formation of a Ph.D. program in Sport Physiology and Performance. This program, the first of its kind in the United States, focuses on sports science and physiology in athletics. It features concentrations in sport physiology and sport performance and started in 2010.

==Athletics==
ETSU collegiate athletic teams, nicknamed &quot;Buccaneers&quot;, compete in the NCAA Division I Southern Conference. The Buccaneers rejoined the Southern Conference in July 2014 after competing in the Atlantic Sun since 2003, when they dropped football. In the 2006-07 year, ETSU won both the conference&#x27;s men and women&#x27;s All-Sport trophies, winning seven team titles. They repeated as the overall and men&#x27;s All-Sport champions in 2007–08 with three team titles, in 2008–09 with five team titles, and in 2009–10 with three team titles.

Current men&#x27;s sports at ETSU are football, baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track and field. Women&#x27;s sports are basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field and volleyball. Men&#x27;s soccer competed at the club level in the fall of 2007, before entering NCAA and Atlantic Sun competition as a scholarship program in the 2008 season. 

With of the addition of football, ETSU rejoined the Southern Conference in 2014 because the A-Sun does not support the sport.

The Mini-Dome on the campus of ETSU houses the intercollegiate athletics offices. Still known by students, faculty, and the community as the Mini-Dome, this campus landmark was officially renamed from &quot;Memorial Center&quot; to &quot;ETSU/Mountain States Health Alliance Athletic Center&quot; and now &quot;Ballad Health Athletic Center&quot;.

The largest building on the ETSU campus, it hosts several indoor track and field meets, and was once the home field for the university&#x27;s football program. The Mini-Dome has hosted many non-athletic events that could not be housed in an indoor setting on most American college campuses, such as national indoor championships for free flight model aircraft.

<text>Itatiaia National Park () was established in 1937 as the first national park in Brazil, and after more than 85 years, the oldest. It is located on the border between the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.

==Location==

The Itatiaia National Park, the oldest national park of Brazil, was created on 14 June 1937 by President Getúlio Vargas as the first of 76 such parks. The park is in the Mantiqueira Mountains.
It covers parts of the municipalities of Itatiaia and Resende in Rio de Janeiro state, and Bocaina de Minas and Itamonte in Minas Gerais state. 
It is mountainous and rocky with altitudes ranging from .
The highest point is the Black Needles peak (Pico das Agulhas Negras).

The higher part of the park contains the origins of 12 river basins that supply the Rio Grande (Grand River), a tributary of the Paraná River, and the Paraíba do Sul, the most important river in Rio de Janeiro state.
The lower part of the park has lush Atlantic Forest vegetation and wide rivers with natural pools and waterfalls.

The Pico das Agulhas Negras is the state&#x27; third highest mountain at .
The park attracts bird watchers from all over the world with its 350 species of birds. Other attractions include hiking and rock climbing.
The park is surrounded by the Serra da Mantiqueira Environmental Protection Area which provides an ecological buffer zone for the park.

The high area of the park is accessible through an entrance about 35 km from the main entrance and gives access to the Pico das Agulhas Negras and Prateleiras complex. 
The low area of the park is much closer to the city of Itatiaia and has many waterfalls, such as Véu da Noiva with 45 meters. The low area has also a Natural History museum.
Itatiaia means &quot;many-pointed rock&quot; in the Tupi language.

<text>Luigi Antonio Lanzi (13 June 1732 – 31 March 1810) was an Italian Jesuit priest, known for his writings as an art historian and archaeologist. When he died he was buried in the church of the Santa Croce at Florence by the side of Michelangelo.

==Biography==
Lanzi was born in the central Italian town of Treia in the Papal States on 13 June 1732. He attended Jesuit schools in Fermo and Rome before joining the Order of St. Ignatius in 1749. Lanzi was appointed keeper of the galleries of Florence in 1773, where he also became president of the Accademia della Crusca. He thereafter studied Italian painting and Etruscan antiquities and language. In the one field his labors are represented by his &quot;Storia Pittorica dell&#x27; Italia&quot;, the first portion of which, containing the Florentine, Sienese, Roman and Neapolitan schools, appeared in 1792, the rest in 1796.

In archaeology his great achievement was &quot;Saggio di lingua Etrusca&quot; (1789), followed by &quot;Saggio delle lingue d&#x27; Italia&quot; in 1806. In his 1806 memoir on the so-called Etruscan vases &quot;Dei vasi antichi dipinti volgarmente chiamati Etruschi&quot;, Lanzi rightly perceived their Greek origin and characters. What was true of the antiquities would be true also, he argued, of the Etruscan language, and the object of the &quot;Saggio di lingua Etrusca&quot; was to prove that this language must be related to that of the neighboring peoples: Romans, Umbrians, Oscans and Greeks.

He was allied with Ennio Quirino Visconti in his great but never accomplished plan of illustrating antiquity altogether from existing literature and monuments. His notices of ancient sculpture and its various styles appeared as an appendix to the &quot;Saggio di lingua Etrusca&quot;, and arose out of his minute study of the treasures then added to the Florentine collection from the Villa Medici. The abuse he met with from later writers on the Etruscan language led Corssen to protest in the name of his real services to philology and archaeology.

Among his other productions was an edition of Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, with valuable notes, and a translation in &quot;terza rima&quot;. Begun in 1785, it was recast and completed in 1808. The list of his works closes with his &quot;Opere sacre&quot;, a series of treatises on spiritual subjects.

<text>The foreign exchange market (forex, FX (pronounced &quot;fix&quot;), or currency market) is a global decentralized or over-the-counter (OTC) market for the trading of currencies. This market determines foreign exchange rates for every currency. It includes all aspects of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. In terms of trading volume, it is by far the largest market in the world, followed by the credit market.

The main participants in this market are the larger international banks. Financial centers around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. Since currencies are always traded in pairs, the foreign exchange market does not set a currency&#x27;s absolute value but rather determines its relative value by setting the market price of one currency if paid for with another. Ex: 1 USD is worth X CAD, or CHF, or JPY, etc.

The foreign exchange market works through financial institutions and operates on several levels. Behind the scenes, banks turn to a smaller number of financial firms known as &quot;dealers&quot;, who are involved in large quantities of foreign exchange trading. Most foreign exchange dealers are banks, so this behind-the-scenes market is sometimes called the &quot;interbank market&quot; (although a few insurance companies and other kinds of financial firms are involved). Trades between foreign exchange dealers can be very large, involving hundreds of millions of dollars. Because of the sovereignty issue when involving two currencies, Forex has little (if any) supervisory entity regulating its actions.

The foreign exchange market assists international trade and investments by enabling currency conversion. For example, it permits a business in the United States to import goods from European Union member states, especially Eurozone members, and pay Euros, even though its income is in United States dollars. It also supports direct speculation and evaluation relative to the value of currencies and the carry trade speculation, based on the differential interest rate between two currencies.

In a typical foreign exchange transaction, a party purchases some quantity of one currency by paying with some quantity of another currency.

The modern foreign exchange market began forming during the 1970s. This followed three decades of government restrictions on foreign exchange transactions under the Bretton Woods system of monetary management, which set out the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world&#x27;s major industrial states after World War II. Countries gradually switched to floating exchange rates from the previous exchange rate regime, which remained fixed per the Bretton Woods system. 

The foreign exchange market is unique because of the following characteristics:
* its huge trading volume, representing the largest asset class in the world leading to high liquidity;
* its geographical dispersion;
* its continuous operation: 24 hours a day except for weekends, i.e., trading from 22:00 UTC on Sunday (Sydney) until 22:00 UTC Friday (New York);
* the variety of factors that affect exchange rates;
* the low margins of relative profit compared with other markets of fixed income; and
* the use of leverage to enhance profit and loss margins and with respect to account size.
As such, it has been referred to as the market closest to the ideal of perfect competition, notwithstanding currency intervention by central banks.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, the preliminary global results from the 2022 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives Markets Activity show that trading in foreign exchange markets averaged per day in April 2022. This is up from in April 2019. Measured by value, foreign exchange swaps were traded more than any other instrument in April 2022, at per day, followed by spot trading at .

The break-down is as follows:
* in spot transactions
* in outright forwards
* in foreign exchange swaps
* currency swaps
* in options and other products

==History==

===Ancient===
Currency trading and exchange first occurred in ancient times. Money-changers (people helping others to change money and also taking a commission or charging a fee) were living in the Holy Land in the times of the Talmudic writings (&quot;Biblical times&quot;). These people (sometimes called &quot;kollybistẻs&quot;) used city stalls, and at feast times the Temple&#x27;s Court of the Gentiles instead. Money-changers were also the silversmiths and/or goldsmiths of more recent ancient times.

During the 4th century AD, the Byzantine government kept a monopoly on the exchange of currency.

Papyri PCZ I 59021 (c.259/8 BC), shows the occurrences of exchange of coinage in Ancient Egypt.

Currency and exchange were important elements of trade in the ancient world, enabling people to buy and sell items like food, pottery, and raw materials. If a Greek coin held more gold than an Egyptian coin due to its size or content, then a merchant could barter fewer Greek gold coins for more Egyptian ones, or for more material goods. This is why, at some point in their history, most world currencies in circulation today had a value fixed to a specific quantity of a recognized standard like silver and gold.

===Medieval and later===
During the 15th century, the Medici family were required to open banks at foreign locations in order to exchange currencies to act on behalf of textile merchants. To facilitate trade, the bank created the &quot;nostro&quot; (from Italian, this translates to &quot;ours&quot;) account book which contained two columned entries showing amounts of foreign and local currencies; information pertaining to the keeping of an account with a foreign bank. During the 17th (or 18th) century, Amsterdam maintained an active Forex market. In 1704, foreign exchange took place between agents acting in the interests of the Kingdom of England and the County of Holland.

===Early modern===
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons traded foreign currencies around 1850 and was a leading currency trader in the USA. In 1880, J.M. do Espírito Santo de Silva (Banco Espírito Santo) applied for and was given permission to engage in a foreign exchange trading business.

The year 1880 is considered by at least one source to be the beginning of modern foreign exchange: the gold standard began in that year.

Prior to the First World War, there was a much more limited control of international trade. Motivated by the onset of war, countries abandoned the gold standard monetary system.

===Modern to post-modern===
From 1899 to 1913, holdings of countries&#x27; foreign exchange increased at an annual rate of 10.8%, while holdings of gold increased at an annual rate of 6.3% between 1903 and 1913.

At the end of 1913, nearly half of the world&#x27;s foreign exchange was conducted using the pound sterling. The number of foreign banks operating within the boundaries of London increased from 3 in 1860, to 71 in 1913. In 1902, there were just two London foreign exchange brokers. At the start of the 20th century, trades in currencies was most active in Paris, New York City and Berlin; Britain remained largely uninvolved until 1914. Between 1919 and 1922, the number of foreign exchange brokers in London increased to 17; and in 1924, there were 40 firms operating for the purposes of exchange.

During the 1920s, the Kleinwort family were known as the leaders of the foreign exchange market, while Japheth, Montagu &amp; Co. and Seligman still warrant recognition as significant FX traders. The trade in London began to resemble its modern manifestation. By 1928, Forex trade was integral to the financial functioning of the city. However, during the 1930s, London&#x27;s pursuit of widespread trade prosperity was hindered by continental exchange controls and additional factors in Europe and Latin America. Some of these additional factors include tariff rates and quota, protectionist policies, trade barriers and taxes, economic depression and agricultural overproduction, and impact of protection on trade.

====After World War II====
In 1944, the Bretton Woods Accord was signed, allowing currencies to fluctuate within a range of ±1% from the currency&#x27;s par exchange rate. In Japan, the Foreign Exchange Bank Law was introduced in 1954. As a result, the Bank of Tokyo became a center of foreign exchange by September 1954. Between 1954 and 1959, Japanese law was changed to allow foreign exchange dealings in many more Western currencies.

U.S. President, Richard Nixon is credited with ending the Bretton Woods Accord and fixed rates of exchange, eventually resulting in a free-floating currency system. After the Accord ended in 1971, the Smithsonian Agreement allowed rates to fluctuate by up to ±2%. In 1961–62, the volume of foreign operations by the U.S. Federal Reserve was relatively low. Those responsible for managing exchange rates then found the boundaries of the Agreement unrealistic. As a result, it led to its discontinuation in March 1973. Afterwards, none of the major currencies (such as the US dollar, the British pound, or the Japanese yen) were maintained with a capacity for conversion to gold. Instead, organizations relied on reserves of currency to facilitate international trade and back the value of their own currency. From 1970 to 1973, the volume of trading in the market increased three-fold. At some time (according to &quot;Gandolfo&quot; during February–March 1973) some of the markets were &quot;split&quot;, and a two-tier currency market was subsequently introduced, with dual currency rates. This was abolished in March 1974.

Reuters introduced computer monitors during June 1973, replacing the telephones and telex used previously for trading quotes.

====Markets close====
Due to the ultimate ineffectiveness of the Bretton Woods Accord and the European Joint Float, the forex markets were forced to close sometime during 1972 and March 1973. This was a result of the collapse of the Bretton Woods System, as major currencies began to float against each other, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate system. Meanwhile, the largest purchase of US dollars in the history of 1976 was when the West German government achieved an almost 3 billion dollar acquisition (a figure is given as 2.75 billion in total by The Statesman: Volume 18 1974). This event indicated the impossibility of balancing of exchange rates by the measures of control used at the time, and the monetary system and the foreign exchange markets in West Germany and other countries within Europe closed for two weeks (during February and, or, March 1973. &quot;Giersch, Paqué, &amp; Schmieding&quot; state closed after purchase of &quot;7.5 million Dmarks&quot; &quot;Brawley&quot; states &quot;... Exchange markets had to be closed. When they re-opened ... March 1 &quot; that is a large purchase occurred after the close).

====After 1973====
In developed nations, state control of foreign exchange trading ended in 1973 when complete floating and relatively free market conditions of modern times began. Other sources claim that the first time a currency pair was traded by U.S. retail customers was during 1982, with additional currency pairs becoming available by the next year.

On 1 January 1981, as part of changes beginning during 1978, the People&#x27;s Bank of China allowed certain domestic &quot;enterprises&quot; to participate in foreign exchange trading. Sometime during 1981, the South Korean government ended Forex controls and allowed free trade to occur for the first time. During 1988, the country&#x27;s government accepted the IMF quota for international trade.

Intervention by European banks (especially the Bundesbank) influenced the Forex market on 27 February 1985. The greatest proportion of all trades worldwide during 1987 were within the United Kingdom (slightly over one quarter). The United States had the second highest involvement in trading.

During 1991, Iran changed international agreements with some countries from oil-barter to foreign exchange.

==Market size and liquidity==

The foreign exchange market is the most liquid financial market in the world. Traders include governments and central banks, commercial banks, other institutional investors and financial institutions, currency speculators, other commercial corporations, and individuals. According to the 2019 Triennial Central Bank Survey, coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements, average daily turnover was in April 2022 (compared to in 2004). Of this , was spot transactions and $5.4 trillion was traded in outright forwards, swaps, and other derivatives.

Foreign exchange is traded in an over-the-counter market where brokers/dealers negotiate directly with one another, so there is no central exchange or clearing house. The biggest geographic trading center is the United Kingdom, primarily London. In April 2022, trading in the United Kingdom accounted for 38.1% of the total, making it by far the most important center for foreign exchange trading in the world. Owing to London&#x27;s dominance in the market, a particular currency&#x27;s quoted price is usually the London market price. For instance, when the International Monetary Fund calculates the value of its special drawing rights every day, they use the London market prices at noon that day. Trading in the United States accounted for 19.4%, Singapore and Hong Kong account for 9.4% and 7.1%, respectively, and Japan accounted for 4.4%.

Turnover of exchange-traded foreign exchange futures and options was growing rapidly in 2004–2013, reaching in April 2013 (double the turnover recorded in April 2007). As of April 2022, exchange-traded currency derivatives represent 2% of OTC foreign exchange turnover. Foreign exchange futures contracts were introduced in 1972 at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and are traded more than to most other futures contracts.

Most developed countries permit the trading of derivative products (such as futures and options on futures) on their exchanges. All these developed countries already have fully convertible capital accounts. Some governments of emerging markets do not allow foreign exchange derivative products on their exchanges because they have capital controls. The use of derivatives is growing in many emerging economies. Countries such as South Korea, South Africa, and India have established currency futures exchanges, despite having some capital controls.

Foreign exchange trading increased by 20% between April 2007 and April 2010 and has more than doubled since 2004. The increase in turnover is due to a number of factors: the growing importance of foreign exchange as an asset class, the increased trading activity of high-frequency traders, and the emergence of retail investors as an important market segment. The growth of electronic execution and the diverse selection of execution venues has lowered transaction costs, increased market liquidity, and attracted greater participation from many customer types. In particular, electronic trading via online portals has made it easier for retail traders to trade in the foreign exchange market. By 2010, retail trading was estimated to account for up to 10% of spot turnover, or $150 billion per day (see below: Retail foreign exchange traders).

==Market participants==
Unlike a stock market, the foreign exchange market is divided into levels of access. At the top is the interbank foreign exchange market, which is made up of the largest commercial banks and securities dealers. Within the interbank market, spreads represent the gap between the bid (the highest price a buyer is willing to pay) and ask (the lowest price a seller is willing to accept) prices in trading. Relationships play a role in a bank&#x27;s access to interbank market liquidity. Banks with reserve imbalances may prefer to borrow from banks with established relationships and can sometimes secure loans at more favorable interest rates compared to other sources.

The difference between the bid and ask prices widens (for example from 0 to 1 pip to 1–2 pips for currencies such as the EUR) as you go down the levels of access. This is due to volume. If a trader can guarantee large numbers of transactions for large amounts, they can demand a smaller difference between the bid and ask price, which is referred to as a better spread. The levels of access that make up the foreign exchange market are determined by the size of the &quot;line&quot; (the amount of money with which they are trading). The top-tier interbank market accounts for 51% of all transactions. After that, smaller banks, large multinational corporations (requiring risk hedging and cross-border payroll), major hedge funds, and even a few retail market makers come into play. According to Galati and Melvin, “Pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and other institutional investors have played an increasingly important role in financial markets in general, and in FX markets in particular, since the early 2000s.” (2004) In addition, he notes, “Hedge funds have grown markedly over the 2001–2004 period in terms of both number and overall size”. Central banks also participate in the foreign exchange market to align currencies to their economic needs.

===Commercial companies===
An important part of the foreign exchange market comes from the financial activities of companies seeking foreign exchange to pay for goods or services. Commercial companies often trade fairly small amounts compared to those of banks or speculators, and their trades often have a little short-term impact on market rates. Nevertheless, trade flows are an important factor in the long-term direction of a currency&#x27;s exchange rate. Some multinational corporations (MNCs) can have an unpredictable impact when very large positions are covered due to exposures that are not widely known by other market participants.

===Central banks===
National central banks play an important role in the foreign exchange markets. They try to control the money supply, inflation, and/or interest rates and often have official or unofficial target rates for their currencies. They can use their often substantial foreign exchange reserves to stabilize the market. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of central bank &quot;stabilizing speculation&quot; is doubtful because central banks do not go bankrupt if they make large losses as other traders would. There is also no convincing evidence that they actually make a profit from trading.

===Foreign exchange fixing===
Foreign exchange fixing is the daily monetary exchange rate fixed by the national bank of each country. The idea is that central banks use the fixing time and exchange rate to evaluate the behavior of their currency. Fixing exchange rates reflect the real value of equilibrium in the market. Banks, dealers, and traders use fixing rates as a market trend indicator.

The mere expectation or rumor of a central bank foreign exchange intervention might be enough to stabilize the currency. However, aggressive intervention might be used several times each year in countries with a dirty float currency regime. Central banks do not always achieve their objectives. The combined resources of the market can easily overwhelm any central bank. Several scenarios of this nature were seen in the 1992–93 European Exchange Rate Mechanism collapse, and in more recent times in Asia.

===Investment management firms===
Investment management firms (who typically manage large accounts on behalf of customers such as pension funds and endowments) use the foreign exchange market to facilitate transactions in foreign securities. For example, an investment manager bearing an international equity portfolio needs to purchase and sell several pairs of foreign currencies to pay for foreign securities purchases.

Some investment management firms also have more speculative specialist currency overlay operations, which manage clients&#x27; currency exposures with the aim of generating profits as well as limiting risk. While the number of this type of specialist firms is quite small, many have a large value of assets under management and can, therefore, generate large trades.

===Retail foreign exchange traders===

Individual retail speculative traders constitute a growing segment of this market. Currently, they participate indirectly through brokers or banks. Retail brokers, while largely controlled and regulated in the US by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and National Futures Association, have previously been subjected to periodic foreign exchange fraud. To deal with the issue, in 2010 the NFA required its members that deal in the Forex markets to register as such (i.e., Forex CTA instead of a CTA). Those NFA members that would traditionally be subject to minimum net capital requirements, FCMs and IBs, are subject to greater minimum net capital requirements if they deal in Forex. A number of the foreign exchange brokers operate from the UK under Financial Services Authority regulations where foreign exchange trading using margin is part of the wider over-the-counter derivatives trading industry that includes contracts for difference and financial spread betting.

There are two main types of retail FX brokers offering the opportunity for speculative currency trading: &quot;brokers&quot; and &quot;dealers&quot; or &quot;market makers&quot;. &quot;Brokers&quot; serve as an agent of the customer in the broader FX market, by seeking the best price in the market for a retail order and dealing on behalf of the retail customer. They charge a commission or &quot;mark-up&quot; in addition to the price obtained in the market. &quot;Dealers&quot; or &quot;market makers&quot;, by contrast, typically act as principals in the transaction versus the retail customer, and quote a price they are willing to deal at.

===Non-bank foreign exchange companies===
Non-bank foreign exchange companies offer currency exchange and international payments to private individuals and companies. These are also known as &quot;foreign exchange brokers&quot; but are distinct in that they do not offer speculative trading but rather currency exchange with payments (i.e., there is usually a physical delivery of currency to a bank account).

It is estimated that in the UK, 14% of currency transfers/payments are made via Foreign Exchange Companies. These companies&#x27; selling point is usually that they will offer better exchange rates or cheaper payments than the customer&#x27;s bank. These companies differ from Money Transfer/Remittance Companies in that they generally offer higher-value services. The volume of transactions done through Foreign Exchange Companies in India amounts to
about US$2 billion per day. This does not compete favorably with any well developed foreign exchange market of international repute, but with the entry of online Foreign Exchange Companies the market is steadily growing. Around 25% of currency transfers/payments in India are made via non-bank Foreign Exchange Companies. Most of these companies use the USP of better exchange rates than the banks. They are regulated by FEDAI and any transaction in foreign Exchange is governed by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA).

===Money transfer/remittance companies and bureaux de change===

Money transfer companies/remittance companies perform high-volume low-value transfers generally by economic migrants back to their home country. In 2007, the Aite Group estimated that there were $369 billion of remittances (an increase of 8% on the previous year). The four largest foreign markets (India, China, Mexico, and the Philippines) receive $95 billion. The largest and best-known provider is Western Union with 345,000 agents globally, followed by UAE Exchange.

Bureaux de change or currency transfer companies provide low-value foreign exchange services for travelers. These are typically located at airports and stations or at tourist locations and allow physical notes to be exchanged from one currency to another. They access foreign exchange markets via banks or non-bank foreign exchange companies.

== Most traded currencies by value ==

There is no unified or centrally cleared market for the majority of trades, and there is very little cross-border regulation. Due to the over-the-counter (OTC) nature of currency markets, there are rather a number of interconnected marketplaces, where different currencies instruments are traded. This implies that there is not a &quot;single&quot; exchange rate but rather a number of different rates (prices), depending on what bank or market maker is trading, and where it is. In practice, the rates are quite close due to arbitrage. Due to London&#x27;s dominance in the market, a particular currency&#x27;s quoted price is usually the London market price. Major trading exchanges include Electronic Broking Services (EBS) and Thomson Reuters Dealing, while major banks also offer trading systems. A joint venture of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, called Fxmarketspace opened in 2007 and aspired but failed to the role of a central market clearing mechanism.

The main trading centers are London and New York City, though Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore are all important centers as well. Banks throughout the world participate. Currency trading happens continuously throughout the day; as the Asian trading session ends, the European session begins, followed by the North American session and then back to the Asian session.

Fluctuations in exchange rates are usually caused by actual monetary flows as well as by expectations of changes in monetary flows. These are caused by changes in gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation (purchasing power parity theory), interest rates (interest rate parity, Domestic Fisher effect, International Fisher effect), budget and trade deficits or surpluses, large cross-border M&amp;A deals and other macroeconomic conditions. Major news is released publicly, often on scheduled dates, so many people have access to the same news at the same time. However, large banks have an important advantage; they can see their customers&#x27; order flow.

Currencies are traded against one another in pairs. Each currency pair thus constitutes an individual trading product and is traditionally noted XXXYYY or XXX/YYY, where XXX and YYY are the ISO 4217 international three-letter code of the currencies involved. The first currency (XXX) is the base currency that is quoted relative to the second currency (YYY), called the counter currency (or quote currency). For instance, the quotation &quot;EURUSD (EUR/USD) 1.5465&quot; is the price of the Euro expressed in US dollars, meaning 1 euro = 1.5465 dollars. The market convention is to quote most exchange rates against the USD with the US dollar as the base currency (e.g. USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF). The exceptions are the British pound (GBP), Australian dollar (AUD), the New Zealand dollar (NZD) and the euro (EUR) where the USD is the counter currency (e.g. GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, EURUSD)..

The factors affecting XXX will affect both XXXYYY and XXXZZZ. This causes a positive currency correlation between XXXYYY and XXXZZZ.

On the spot market, according to the 2022 Triennial Survey, the most heavily traded bilateral currency pairs were:
* EURUSD: 22.7%
* USDJPY: 13.5%
* GBPUSD (also called &quot;cable&quot;): 9.5%
The U.S. currency was involved in 88.5% of transactions, followed by the euro (30.5%), the yen (16.7%), and sterling (12.9%) (see table). Volume percentages for all individual currencies should add up to 200%, as each transaction involves two currencies.

Trading in the euro has grown considerably since the currency&#x27;s creation in January 1999, and how long the foreign exchange market will remain dollar-centered is open to debate. Until recently, trading the euro versus a non-European currency ZZZ would have usually involved two trades: EURUSD and USDZZZ. The exception to this is EURJPY, which is an established traded currency pair in the interbank spot market.

==Determinants of exchange rates==
In a fixed exchange rate regime, exchange rates are decided by the government, while a number of theories have been proposed to explain (and predict) the fluctuations in exchange rates in a floating exchange rate regime, including:

* International parity conditions: Relative purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, Domestic Fisher effect, International Fisher effect. To some extent the above theories provide logical explanation for the fluctuations in exchange rates, yet these theories falter as they are based on challengeable assumptions (e.g., free flow of goods, services, and capital) which seldom hold true in the real world.
* Balance of payments model: This model, however, focuses largely on tradable goods and services, ignoring the increasing role of global capital flows. It failed to provide any explanation for the continuous appreciation of the US dollar during the 1980s and most of the 1990s, despite the soaring US current account deficit.
* Asset market model: views currencies as an important asset class for constructing investment portfolios. Asset prices are influenced mostly by people&#x27;s willingness to hold the existing quantities of assets, which in turn depends on their expectations on the future worth of these assets. The asset market model of exchange rate determination states that “the exchange rate between two currencies represents the price that just balances the relative supplies of, and demand for, assets denominated in those currencies.”

None of the models developed so far succeed to explain exchange rates and volatility in the longer time frames. For shorter time frames (less than a few days), algorithms can be devised to predict prices. It is understood from the above models that many macroeconomic factors affect the exchange rates and in the end currency prices are a result of dual forces of supply and demand. The world&#x27;s currency markets can be viewed as a huge melting pot: in a large and ever-changing mix of current events, supply and demand factors are constantly shifting, and the price of one currency in relation to another shifts accordingly. No other market encompasses (and distills) as much of what is going on in the world at any given time as foreign exchange.

Supply and demand for any given currency, and thus its value, are not influenced by any single element, but rather by several. These elements generally fall into three categories: economic factors, political conditions, and market psychology.

===Economic factors===
Economic factors include: (a) economic policy, disseminated by government agencies and central banks, (b) economic conditions, generally revealed through economic reports, and other economic indicators.

* Economic policy comprises government fiscal policy (budget/spending practices) and monetary policy (the means by which a government&#x27;s central bank influences the supply and &quot;cost&quot; of money, which is reflected by the level of interest rates).
* Government budget deficits or surpluses: The market usually reacts negatively to widening government budget deficits, and positively to narrowing budget deficits. The impact is reflected in the value of a country&#x27;s currency.
* Balance of trade levels and trends: The trade flow between countries illustrates the demand for goods and services, which in turn indicates demand for a country&#x27;s currency to conduct trade. Surpluses and deficits in trade of goods and services reflect the competitiveness of a nation&#x27;s economy. For example, trade deficits may have a negative impact on a nation&#x27;s currency.
* Inflation levels and trends: Typically a currency will lose value if there is a high level of inflation in the country or if inflation levels are perceived to be rising. This is because inflation erodes purchasing power, thus demand, for that particular currency. However, a currency may sometimes strengthen when inflation rises because of expectations that the central bank will raise short-term interest rates to combat rising inflation.
* Economic growth and health: Reports such as GDP, employment levels, retail sales, capacity utilization and others, detail the levels of a country&#x27;s economic growth and health. Generally, the more healthy and robust a country&#x27;s economy, the better its currency will perform, and the more demand for it there will be.
* Productivity of an economy: Increasing productivity in an economy should positively influence the value of its currency. Its effects are more prominent if the increase is in the traded sector.

===Political conditions===
Internal, regional, and international political conditions and events can have a profound effect on currency markets.

All exchange rates are susceptible to political instability and anticipations about the new ruling party. Political upheaval and instability can have a negative impact on a nation&#x27;s economy. For example, destabilization of coalition governments in Pakistan and Thailand can negatively affect the value of their currencies. Similarly, in a country experiencing financial difficulties, the rise of a political faction that is perceived to be fiscally responsible can have the opposite effect. Also, events in one country in a region may spur positive/negative interest in a neighboring country and, in the process, affect its currency.

===Market psychology===
Market psychology and trader perceptions influence the foreign exchange market in a variety of ways:
* Flights to quality: Unsettling international events can lead to a &quot;flight-to-quality&quot;, a type of capital flight whereby investors move their assets to a perceived &quot;safe haven&quot;. There will be a greater demand, thus a higher price, for currencies perceived as stronger over their relatively weaker counterparts. The US dollar, Swiss franc and gold have been traditional safe havens during times of political or economic uncertainty.
* Long-term trends: Currency markets often move in visible long-term trends. Although currencies do not have an annual growing season like physical commodities, business cycles do make themselves felt. Cycle analysis looks at longer-term price trends that may rise from economic or political trends.
* &quot;Buy the rumor, sell the fact&quot;: This market truism can apply to many currency situations. It is the tendency for the price of a currency to reflect the impact of a particular action before it occurs and, when the anticipated event comes to pass, react in exactly the opposite direction. This may also be referred to as a market being &quot;oversold&quot; or &quot;overbought&quot;. To buy the rumor or sell the fact can also be an example of the cognitive bias known as Anchoring, when investors focus too much on the relevance of outside events to currency prices.
* Economic numbers: While economic numbers can certainly reflect economic policy, some reports and numbers take on a talisman-like effect: the number itself becomes important to market psychology and may have an immediate impact on short-term market moves. &quot;What to watch&quot; can change over time. In recent years, for example, money supply, employment, trade balance figures and inflation numbers have all taken turns in the spotlight.
* Technical trading considerations: As in other markets, the accumulated price movements in a currency pair such as EUR/USD can form apparent patterns that traders may attempt to use. Many traders study price charts in order to identify such patterns.

==Financial instruments==

===Spot===

A spot transaction is a two-day delivery transaction (except in the case of trades between the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Turkish lira, euro and Russian ruble, which settle the next business day), as opposed to the futures contracts, which are usually three months. This trade represents a “direct exchange” between two currencies, has the shortest time frame, involves cash rather than a contract, and interest is not included in the agreed-upon transaction. Spot trading is one of the most common types of forex trading. Often, a forex broker will charge a small fee to the client to roll-over the expiring transaction into a new identical transaction for a continuation of the trade. This roll-over fee is known as the &quot;swap&quot; fee.

===Forward===

One way to deal with the foreign exchange risk is to engage in a forward transaction. In this transaction, money does not actually change hands until some agreed upon future date. A buyer and seller agree on an exchange rate for any date in the future, and the transaction occurs on that date, regardless of what the market rates are then. The duration of the trade can be one day, a few days, months or years. Usually the date is decided by both parties. Then the forward contract is negotiated and agreed upon by both parties.

===Non-deliverable forward (NDF)===

Forex banks, ECNs, and prime brokers offer NDF contracts, which are derivatives that have no real deliver-ability. NDFs are popular for currencies with restrictions such as the Argentinian peso. In fact, a forex hedger can only hedge such risks with NDFs, as currencies such as the Argentinian peso cannot be traded on open markets like major currencies.

===Swap===

The most common type of forward transaction is the foreign exchange swap. In a swap, two parties exchange currencies for a certain length of time and agree to reverse the transaction at a later date. These are not standardized contracts and are not traded through an exchange. A deposit is often required in order to hold the position open until the transaction is completed.

===Futures===

Futures are standardized forward contracts and are usually traded on an exchange created for this purpose. The average contract length is roughly 3 months. Futures contracts are usually inclusive of any interest amounts.

Currency futures contracts are contracts specifying a standard volume of a particular currency to be exchanged on a specific settlement date. Thus the currency futures contracts are similar to forward contracts in terms of their obligation, but differ from forward contracts in the way they are traded. In addition, Futures are daily settled removing credit risk that exist in Forwards. They are commonly used by MNCs to hedge their currency positions. In addition they are traded by speculators who hope to capitalize on their expectations of exchange rate movements.

===Option===

A foreign exchange option (commonly shortened to just FX option) is a derivative where the owner has the right but not the obligation to exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date. The FX options market is the deepest, largest and most liquid market for options of any kind in the world.

==Speculation==
Controversy about currency speculators and their effect on currency devaluations and national economies recurs regularly. Economists, such as Milton Friedman, have argued that speculators ultimately are a stabilizing influence on the market, and that stabilizing speculation performs the important function of providing a market for hedgers and transferring risk from those people who don&#x27;t wish to bear it, to those who do. Other economists, such as Joseph Stiglitz, consider this argument to be based more on politics and a free market philosophy than on economics.

Large hedge funds and other well capitalized &quot;position traders&quot; are the main professional speculators. According to some economists, individual traders could act as &quot;noise traders&quot; and have a more destabilizing role than larger and better informed actors.

Currency speculation is considered a highly suspect activity in many countries, such as Thailand. While investment in traditional financial instruments like bonds or stocks often is considered to contribute positively to economic growth by providing capital, currency speculation does not; according to this view, it is simply gambling that often interferes with economic policy. For example, in 1992, currency speculation forced Sweden&#x27;s central bank, the Riksbank, to raise interest rates for a few days to 500% per annum, and later to devalue the krona. Mahathir Mohamad, one of the former Prime Ministers of Malaysia, is one well-known proponent of this view. He blamed the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit in 1997 on George Soros and other speculators.

Gregory Millman reports on an opposing view, comparing speculators to &quot;vigilantes&quot; who simply help &quot;enforce&quot; international agreements and anticipate the effects of basic economic &quot;laws&quot; in order to profit. In this view, countries may develop unsustainable economic bubbles or otherwise mishandle their national economies, and foreign exchange speculators made the inevitable collapse happen sooner. A relatively quick collapse might even be preferable to continued economic mishandling, followed by an eventual, larger, collapse. Mahathir Mohamad and other critics of speculation are viewed as trying to deflect the blame from themselves for having caused the unsustainable economic conditions.

==Risk aversion==
Risk aversion is a kind of trading behavior exhibited by the foreign exchange market when a potentially adverse event happens that may affect market conditions. This behavior is caused when risk averse traders liquidate their positions in risky assets and shift the funds to less risky assets due to uncertainty.

In the context of the foreign exchange market, traders liquidate their positions in various currencies to take up positions in safe-haven currencies, such as the US dollar. Sometimes, the choice of a safe haven currency is more of a choice based on prevailing sentiments rather than one of economic statistics. An example would be the financial crisis of 2008. The value of equities across the world fell while the US dollar strengthened (see Fig.1). This happened despite the strong focus of the crisis in the US.

==Carry trade==
Currency carry trade refers to the act of borrowing one currency that has a low interest rate in order to purchase another with a higher interest rate. A large difference in rates can be highly profitable for the trader, especially if high leverage is used. However, with all levered investments this is a double edged sword, and large exchange rate price fluctuations can suddenly swing trades into huge losses.

<doc id="648290" wikidata="Q721887" url="?curid=648290" title="Lionel Blue">
<text>Lionel Blue (né Bluestein; 6 February 1930 – 19 December 2016) was a British Reform rabbi, journalist and broadcaster, described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;one of the most respected religious figures in the UK&quot;. He was best known for his longstanding work with the media, most notably his wry and gentle sense of humour on &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today programme&quot;. He was the first British rabbi publicly to declare his homosexuality.

==Career==
Blue was born in the East End of London in 1930. His parents were Jews of Russian origin and his father worked as a tailor. Blue did not receive a religious education, declaring that he lost his religious faith at the age of five after a petitionary prayer failed to remove Adolf Hitler and Oswald Mosley. Instead, Blue became interested in Marxism. He entered Hendon County School at sixth form level, following education in the East End and a year out of school at age 16–17. He served in the British Army but was discharged after having a nervous breakdown brought on by anxiety over his closet homosexuality.

Blue read history at Balliol College, Oxford and Semitics at University College London. He regained his faith while at Oxford, when he found some resolution to severe personal conflicts regarding his sexual orientation at a Quaker meeting. He also found Victor Gollancz&#x27;s &quot;A Year of Grace&quot; helpful during this time, and finally became one of the first two students at Leo Baeck College for training rabbis in 1956.

Blue was ordained as a rabbi in 1960. Between 1960 and 1963, Blue was the minister of the Settlement Synagogue and Middlesex New Synagogue. He then became the European Director of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. In 1967, he began a long-term engagement as a lecturer at Leo Baeck College in London. He lived in Finchley, north London.

Blue made his first radio broadcast in 1967 and was a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; programme for 25 years. He made numerous appearances on BBC Radio 4 and Radio 2, also producing a television programme entitled &quot;In Search of Holy England&quot; in 1989. In 1978, he collaborated with the author June Rose, on a cookbook, &quot;A Taste of Heaven: Adventures in Food &amp; Faith&quot;. In 2006, a return trip to his childhood home in London&#x27;s East End to mark the 350th anniversary of Jewish life in Britain was the subject of an evocative audioslideshow on the BBC News website.

Blue was awarded honorary doctorates from the Open University and Durham University. In 1994, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

==Personal life==
Blue came out in 1980 while he was involved with sailboat designer Christopher &quot;Kim&quot; Holman, a relationship which lasted from 1962 to 1982. He published &quot;Godly and Gay&quot; in 1981.

After his split with Holman, Blue met Jim Cummings through a personal ad in &quot;Gay Times&quot;. They remained together until Cummings&#x27;s death in 2014. He was involved with various gay charities, including the Jewish Gay and Lesbian Group, and Kairos in Soho. 

==Illnesses and death==
Blue was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 57; however, he successfully controlled his disorder with medication. During an operation in 1997, a surgeon discovered a tumour which tests proved to be malignant. He received radiotherapy and hormonal treatment to reduce any further growth. He was also diagnosed as having Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Blue died on 19 December 2016 at the age of 86.

<doc id="648294" wikidata="Q1189081" url="?curid=648294" title="Dennis DeYoung">
<text>Dennis DeYoung (born February 18, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter and keyboardist. He was a founding member of the rock band Styx and served as its primary lead vocalist and keyboardist from 1972 until 1999. DeYoung was the band&#x27;s most prolific and successful writer, having been credited as the writer of more Styx songs than any other band member. DeYoung penned seven of the band&#x27;s eight &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10 singles as well as a solo top 10 single.
==Life and career==
===1947–1970: Early life===
Dennis DeYoung was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Maurice DeYoung (1918–1997) and Loraine Rolla DeYoung (1923–2001). He had a younger sister, Darcy, who died in 2021. DeYoung was raised Catholic and is of Dutch and Italian ancestry. Growing up in the Roseland area of Chicago, DeYoung started his career as an accordionist in 1962 at the age of 15 when he teamed up with his 13-year-old neighbors Chuck and John Panozzo in a three-piece combo originally called The Tradewinds. The trio added guitarist Tom Nardini in 1964 and renamed the band TW4. In 1968, Nardini was replaced by John Curulewski and in 1970 DeYoung hired James Young to become the second guitarist in TW4. The band changed the name to Styx in 1972, upon signing their first record contract.

Before the band met with success, DeYoung spent time as a school teacher in the Southern suburbs of Chicago, where he was a music teacher in District 143. One teacher hosted dinner parties for co-workers; DeYoung always attended and would inevitably offer to play the piano, entertaining all for hours. During this period, the band played a number of small venues and school auditoriums in an effort to secure a record deal.

DeYoung met his wife Suzanne at a high school dance when he was 17 and she was 15. They married in 1970.

===1972–1984: Tenure with Styx===
Within Styx, DeYoung acted as lead vocalist, keyboardist, accordion player, producer and songwriter. From the start of Styx&#x27;s commercial success with the 1973 DeYoung-penned single &quot;Lady&quot;, DeYoung became the creative force behind most of the band&#x27;s hit songs. DeYoung wrote and sang lead on seven of the band&#x27;s eight top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-ranked hits during this period, with Tommy Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; (No. 9) being the sole exception. The seven DeYoung penned-and-performed top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; hits, in order of their peak chart placement are:

* &quot;Babe&quot;, the band&#x27;s only Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit to date. Also hit No. 1 on Radio and Records chart.
* &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; (No. 3 Billboard, No. 3 R &amp; R)
* &quot;Show Me the Way&quot; (No. 3 Billboard, No. 7 R &amp; R)
* &quot;The Best of Times&quot; (No. 3 and No. 1 R &amp; R)
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It End&quot; (No. 6 Billboard, No. 3 R &amp; R)
* &quot;Lady&quot;, the band&#x27;s 1973 breakthrough hit (No. 6 in March 1975 Billboard and No. 7 R &amp; R)
* &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; (No. 8 Billboard, No. 9 R &amp; R)

A self-taught pianist, DeYoung quickly became one of the most notable keyboard players in rock. Featured on the cover of the January 1981 issue of &quot;Contemporary Keyboard&quot; magazine (a story that was reprinted in &quot;Contemporary Keyboard&quot;&#x27;s book on the greatest rock keyboardists), DeYoung described many of his steps along the way through his keyboard-playing career: He had never played an acoustic piano until the recording session for 1973&#x27;s &quot;Lady&quot;; he recorded the track for 1979&#x27;s &quot;Babe&quot; on a Fender Rhodes electric piano, an instrument he had never touched before, at Pumpkin Studios because the studio&#x27;s grand piano was out of tune; when playing accordion for the song &quot;Boat on the River&quot; from the &quot;Cornerstone&quot; album, DeYoung discovered how small the keys felt to his fingers after years of playing pianos and Hammond organs.

As a keyboardist in Styx, DeYoung was best remembered for his prominent lead synthesizer solos performed on the Oberheim Four Voice that dominated the mix with a unique tone, a key element of the Styx sound. Influenced by the recent release of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s first album, DeYoung – a novice synthesizer player at the time – used a modular Moog to record the keyboard tracks for Styx&#x27;s debut album in 1972. This album featured a rock version of &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;, more than five years before ELP came up with a similar idea of recording this classical composition as a rock band featuring the synthesizer, that would later become one of ELP&#x27;s best known recordings.

DeYoung&#x27;s songs often had a grandiose style to them in the tradition of 1970s theatrical rock, which heavily influenced the group&#x27;s direction in the late 1970s, culminating in the concept albums &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot; (1981) and &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; (1983). The dissent of some members in the band during &quot;Kilroy&quot; brought tensions between the group&#x27;s members over the future direction of the band, leading to guitarist Tommy Shaw&#x27;s departure in 1984 to pursue a solo career.

===1984–1989: Early solo career===
With Styx in limbo following Shaw&#x27;s 1984 departure, DeYoung began a solo career of modest success. His first solo album, &quot;Desert Moon&quot; (1984), generated a top 10 hit, &quot;Desert Moon&quot;, and the follow-up single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait for Heroes&quot;, cracked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 as well. The &quot;Desert Moon&quot; album was certified gold in Canada in 1984. To date, &quot;Desert Moon&quot; is the only solo single by any Styx member to hit the Billboard Top 10.

DeYoung&#x27;s solo career continued with &quot;Back to the World&quot; (1986), which contained the singles &quot;Call Me&quot; and &quot;This Is the Time&quot;, which was featured in the soundtrack of &quot;Karate Kid II&quot; (1986) movie. His third solo album &quot;Boomchild&quot; (1988) failed to have a hit single, though the video for &quot;Boomchild&quot; received a fair amount of music video airplay.

After a five-year hiatus; DeYoung and several other members of Styx began discussing a possible reunion in 1989. By December 1989, Styx had unofficially reformed. Tommy Shaw, who joined Damn Yankees in 1988, did not return.

===1990–1992: Reuniting with Styx===
In 1990, Styx (minus Tommy Shaw, who was replaced by guitarist/singer-songwriter Glen Burtnik) returned to the studio for the album &quot;Edge of the Century&quot; (1990). &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;, a track written by DeYoung for his son Matthew, received extensive radio play, peaking at #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart (Styx&#x27;s 8th top 10 single, and 7th written and sung by DeYoung) particularly after a number of radio stations mixed it with voice tracks of members of Congress debating whether or not to send troops to the first Persian Gulf War. This put the group in an exclusive group as one of only a few bands to have a top ten hit single under four different United States presidents. The group toured extensively before A&amp;M Records (which had just merged with PolyGram Records) dropped the group from its roster in 1992; the group broke up again shortly afterwards.

===1993–1995: Venture into acting===
Between stints with Styx, DeYoung was asked to appear in the 20th Anniversary revival tour of the stage musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in 1993, including Ted Neeley, Carl Anderson and Irene Cara, appearing in 268 performances as Pontius Pilate. DeYoung was asked to perform by Tony-winning producer Forbes Candlish. Danny Goldberg, former DeYoung manager and head of A&amp;R at Atlantic Records, asked DeYoung to record an album of Broadway standards; the resulting album, &quot;10 on Broadway&quot;, was released in 1994. While touring with &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, DeYoung began writing the book and score of a musical of his own based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1831 novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;. &quot;Hunchback&quot; was first produced in 1997 at the Tennessee Repertory Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee.

===1995–1999: Second reunion with Styx===
====1995: &quot;Lady &#x27;95&quot;====
A&amp;M Records had released the compilation album &quot;Styx - Classics, Volume 15&quot;, but since A&amp;M did not own the rights to the original recording of &quot;Lady&quot; (which had been released by Wooden Nickel Records through a distribution deal with RCA Records), the track could not be included on the disc. In 1995, DeYoung called Shaw to sing on a new version of &quot;Lady&quot; even though he had not performed on the original. Styx reunited, but without a terminally ill John Panozzo. The band recorded a new version of &quot;Lady,&quot; which became the lead track (&quot;Lady &#x27;95&quot;) of a new compilation album, &quot;Styx Greatest Hits&quot;, for A&amp;M. Todd Sucherman (uncredited) provided the drum track for the recording session. Panozzo died on July 16, 1996. Sucherman took his place, and in 1996, Styx toured for the first time in four years.

====1996–1997: &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; tour====
Styx&#x27;s 1996 tour, dubbed the &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; tour by the band, proved remarkably successful, and a 2-disc live recording of the show (with three new studio tracks) proved even more so; 1997&#x27;s &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; live album, produced by DeYoung, went gold and spawned a top-30 hit on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart, the DeYoung-penned &quot;Paradise&quot;. With the positive response and a new record label (CMC International), Styx returned to the studio in 1998 and began work on their first studio album in eight years.

===1999: Departure from Styx===
DeYoung and his bandmates celebrated the success of 1996&#x27;s &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; tour, and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Grand Illusion&quot; tour. In 1998 the band began work on a new album, &quot;Brave New World&quot;. In January 1998, DeYoung&#x27;s physical health took a turn for the worse; DeYoung said he was afflicted with a severe case of the flu, and the extremely high fever damaged his eyes resulting in severe sensitivity to light which caused him heavy fatigue. James Young and Tommy Shaw of Styx suggested booking a tour in support of the &quot;Brave New World&quot; album. DeYoung asked for six months to recover; Shaw and Young instead replaced him with Canadian rocker Lawrence Gowan in 1999 and went on tour without DeYoung.

After a year-and-a-half of touring under the name &quot;Styx,&quot; without any compensation to DeYoung for usage of the name, DeYoung sued his former bandmates seeking the rights to use the group&#x27;s name in support of his solo career. The suit was settled in 2001, with the group being allowed to keep the name &quot;Styx&quot; and DeYoung able to use the name in descriptive phrases such as &quot;the music of Styx&quot; or &quot;formerly of Styx&quot; (but not &quot;the voice of Styx&quot;). DeYoung has said that the manner in which Shaw and Young vilified him on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; triggered the lawsuit.

Styx has consistently maintained that any chance of a reunion with DeYoung is unlikely. When asked about any possible reunions with DeYoung, James (JY) Young of Styx commented on an edition of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; television series, &quot;Maybe when they are playing hockey on the river Styx. And maybe not even then.&quot; Young also addressed the reunion issue on an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Feuds 2000&quot;, noting the possibility of a reunion would only happen &quot;[as] the Eagles said, &#x27;when Hell freezes over&#x27;.&quot; Bassist Chuck Panozzo, no longer actively touring with Styx due to health problems associated with his HIV-positive status, offered a more hopeful tone to a writer doing a story on the band for tampabay.com; while reflecting on the effect the loss of his fraternal twin brother, John had on the band, Panozzo noted, &quot;Before any more of us die, I would hope that it could happen. Every year that it doesn&#x27;t happen is another year that goes by. And if you wait too long, who will care?&quot; However, in a 2011 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Tommy Shaw indicated that he didn&#x27;t think a reunion was realistic, noting, &quot;We&#x27;re crazy, but we&#x27;re not insane.&quot;

===2000–2019: Post-Styx career===

In February 2000, DeYoung was approached to perform a concert featuring his many songs from Styx, as well as his solo works and his 1997 stage musical &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, with an orchestra. The show, performed at the Rosemont Theatre near DeYoung&#x27;s hometown of Chicago, was a family affair for DeYoung. His wife Suzanne and sister-in-law Dawn Marie Feusi sang backup, his daughter Carrie Ann was in charge of publicity, while his son Matthew designed the stage lighting. The concert was well received and formed the basis for a touring version of the show, and eventually a 2004 live album, &quot;The Music of Styx - Live with Symphony Orchestra&quot;.

Healthy once again, DeYoung returned to touring with a 50-piece orchestra augmented by a five-piece rock band, which included Tommy Dziallo on guitar, Hank Horton on bass, and Kyle Woodring (formerly with John Mellencamp and Deana Carter) on drums, all of whom also played shows with DeYoung with or without the orchestra.

DeYoung made his major motion picture debut in 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect Man&quot;, in which he played the lead vocalist in a Styx tribute band.

In August 2006, DeYoung appeared along with Supertramp&#x27;s Roger Hodgson on &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, where he performed with and mentored the contestants.

On April 20, 2006, at the Community Theatre in Morristown, New Jersey, DeYoung took to the stage once again with former Styx guitarist and bassist Glen Burtnik as part of his &quot;Lost Treasures&quot; concert series. It marked the first time in nearly seven years that the two had appeared together. On his website, DeYoung jokingly dubbed the performances &quot;The Denny and Glenny Show&quot;. While on stage, the duo opened with the Beatles classic &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, and also performed &quot;Watching the World Go By&quot; and &quot;All for Love&quot;, songs that were originally written for the unreleased &quot;Edge of the Century 2&quot; Styx album.

On September 14 and 15, 2006, DeYoung appeared with Hal Sparks on &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;, an American reality television show produced by Simon Cowell. They sang Styx songs &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; and &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot;. DeYoung and Sparks were invited back to perform in the final of &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot; on September 28, 2006. They performed the Styx breakthrough hit &quot;Lady&quot;, written by DeYoung in 1973, with DeYoung serenading his wife Suzanne in the audience while Hal did the same for his long-time girlfriend, and finished in 3rd place.

In 2007, DEP Records of Canada released DeYoung&#x27;s stateside 2004 live CD &quot;Dennis DeYoung and the Music of Styx Live with Symphony Orchestra&quot;, which went on to achieve platinum status. (In Canada 50,000 plus copies sold for a double CD qualifies as platinum.) They also released his DVD &quot;The Rock: Symphonic Music of Styx&quot;, which went triple platinum. In addition, he appeared on the Canadian reality TV series &quot;Star Académie&quot;.

On June 19, 2007, DeYoung released in Canada his fifth solo album, &quot;One Hundred Years from Now&quot;, marking a return to his rock roots. The first single, the title track, was a duet with Québécois singer Éric Lapointe. The single reached number 1 on the Québec Radio Single and Soundscan charts. The album was released in the U.S. on April 14, 2009, with slightly different tracks. One song &quot;I Believe In You&quot; received some airplay on Sirius XM and some local radio stations.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2007, he performed &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot;, &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; and many other Styx classics to a large audience at Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, Canada, and viewers via live television on CHCH-TV Channel 11. Following his concert, he did a brief live interview with CHCH-TV&#x27;s Mat Hayes.

On May 8, 2008, DeYoung&#x27;s musical version of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; premiered at the Bailiwick Repertory Theatre in Chicago. This production went on to win the Joseph Jefferson Award for best musical in Chicago in 2008.

On September 20, 2008, DeYoung performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame benefit concert for the John Entwistle foundation. The benefit concert was held at the Koka Booth Amphitheatre in Cary, North Carolina, and featured many other rock and roll musicians. He and his band performed many of Styx&#x27;s hits.
In November and December 2008, DeYoung was a featured artist on the German Night of the Proms 20-city tour. He joined Robin Gibb, Tears for Fears, 10cc and Kim Wilde on the sold-out tour. He also accompanied Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees on piano performing &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;.

On July 12, 2009, DeYoung was honored by his native city Chicago with the &quot;Great Performer of Illinois Award&quot;. Following the award ceremony in the Frank Gehry-designed Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park in Chicago, DeYoung and his band performed many of Styx&#x27;s hits in a free concert.

In 2010, DeYoung formed a new band dedicated to the music of Styx, adding guitarist and lead vocalist August Zadra and bassist-vocalist Craig Carter to join John Blasucci, guitarist Jimmy Leahey, Tom Sharpe (who left at the end of 2014 to continue his tenure with Mannheim Steamroller, and was replaced by Mike Morales), and wife Suzanne DeYoung in performing Styx hits &quot;Renegade&quot;, &quot;Blue Collar Man&quot; and others as well as DeYoung&#x27;s solo works.

On October 21, 2014, a 2CD + DVD and Blu-ray package, &quot;Dennis DeYoung... And the Music of Styx Live in Los Angeles&quot;, was released in the U.S. via Frontiers Records. The European release date was October 17, 2014. Also on October 21, 2014, a condensed version of this live concert package was broadcast on AXS TV Headliner Club Concert Series. The concert took place at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California on March 18, 2014.

===2020–present: New studio albums===
On May 22, 2020, DeYoung released &quot;26 East, Vol. 1&quot;, his seventh solo studio album and first in over a decade. The title comes from the real-life address on the South Side of Chicago which DeYoung grew up in, where he formed the nucleus of what would become Styx. The last song on the record, &quot;To the Good Old Days&quot;, features Julian Lennon.

&quot;26 East, Vol. 2&quot; was released on June 11, 2021, and is intended to be DeYoung&#x27;s final album. The album features fellow Chicago natives guitarist Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave on a track co-written with Jim Peterik of The Ides of March, formerly of Survivor and 38 Special fame.

On June 5, 2022, Styx was inducted into the Illinois Rock &amp; Roll Museum Hall of Fame. That same night Dennis DeYoung was additionally inducted as a songwriter.

In August 2023, it was announced the music publishing catalog rights for a majority of DeYoung&#x27;s compositions had been acquired by the New York City-headquartered music publishing and talent management company, Primary Wave. The deal included master recording rights for a majority of recordings featuring DeYoung&#x27;s performances.

<text>Sir William Gell FRS (29 March 17774 February 1836), pron. &quot;Jell&quot;, was a British classical archaeologist and illustrator. He published topographical illustrations of Troy and the surrounding area in 1804. He also published illustrations showing the results of archaeological digs at Pompeii. His best-known work is &quot;Pompeiana; the Topography, Edifices and Ornaments of Pompeii&quot;, published between 1817 and 1832.

==Early years and education==
Born at Hopton in Derbyshire, the son of Philip Gell and Dorothy Milnes (daughter and coheir of William Milnes of Aldercar Park). The Gell family was one of the oldest families in England with a tradition of service in the Army, Navy, Parliament and the Church going back to 1209, in the reign of King John. His great grandfather was the parliamentarian Sir John Gell and his uncle was Admiral John Gell. Gell was educated at Derby School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He matriculated there in 1793, took a BA degree in 1798 and an MA in 1804, and was elected a fellow of Emmanuel.

== &quot;The Topography of Troy, and its Vicinity&quot; ==
In 1801, at the age of 24, Gell was sent on his first diplomatic mission to Greece.

From 1804 to 1806 he travelled in Greece, the neighbouring islands, and coastal Asia Minor. In 1804 he fixed the site of Troy at &quot;Bournabashi&quot;, some distance south—approximately six miles or nine-and-a-half kilometres directly, eight miles or thirteen kilometres by modern roads – of the modern consensus site at Hisarlik. He cited Jean Baptiste LeChevalier &quot;and others&quot; as his sources for the idea, which his own observations seemed to him to confirm, although he pointed out what he considered unresolved problems.

He published &quot;The Topography of Troy and its vicinity illustrated and explained by drawings and descriptions etc.&quot; in 1804.

Lord Byron mentions him in his work &#x27;English Bards&#x27; thus:
== Publications ==
William Gell was a great friend of Thomas Moore, Walter Scott and Lord Byron. He wrote many books, most of them illustrated with his own sketches.

He was in 1807 elected a Member of the Society of Dilettanti and a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1811 the Society of Dilettanti commissioned him to explore Greece and Asia Minor. These travels resulted in several publications, e.g. &quot;Geography and Antiquities of Ithaca&quot; and &quot;Itinerary of Greece, with a Commentary on Pausanias and Strabo&quot;.

With these publications he achieved fame in the scholarly circles as a classical topographer. He went with Princess (afterwards Queen) Caroline to Italy in 1814 as one of her chamberlains. He gave evidence in her favour on 6 October 1820, at her trial before the House of Lords, stating that he had left her service merely on account of a fit of the gout and had seen no impropriety between her and her courtier Bergami. However, in letters of 1815 and 1816, written under such pseudonyms as &#x27;Blue Beard&#x27;, &#x27;Adonis&#x27; and &#x27;Gellius&#x27;, he related bits of scandal about the Queen. He was Knighted on 11 May 1814. Gell was a close friend of Keppel Richard Craven and travelled around Italy with him.

== Later years ==
From 1820 until his death, he resided in Rome, where he painted. He had another house in Naples, where he received visitors including his particular friends Sir William Drummond, the Hon. Keppel Craven, John Auldjo, Lady Blessington and Sir Walter Scott.

Although crippled by gout, Sir William took Scott to Pompeii and showed him around the excavations. After Scott&#x27;s death, Sir William drew up an account of their conversations in Naples, part of which is printed in Lockhart&#x27;s &#x27;Life of Scott&#x27;. It was then that he published some of his best known archaeological work including &quot;Pompeiana&quot; and &quot;The Topography of Troy&quot;.

Gell died at Naples in 1836 and was buried in the English Cemetery, Naples. On his death he left all his personal belongings to Craven.

== Legacy ==
His numerous drawings of classical ruins and localities, executed with great detail and exactness, are preserved in the British Museum. Gell was a thorough dilettante, fond of society and possessed of little real scholarship. Nonetheless his topographical works became recognised text-books at a time when Greece and even Italy were but superficially known to English travellers. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries of London, and a member of the Institute of France and the Royal Academy in Berlin.

His best-known work is &quot;Pompeiana; the Topography, Edifices and Ornaments of Pompeii&quot;, published between 1817 and 1832, in the first part of which he was assisted by J. P. Gandy. It was followed in 1834 by the &quot;Topography of Rome and its Vicinity&quot;. He wrote also &quot;Topography of Troy and its Vicinity&quot; (1804); &quot;Geography and Antiquities of Ithaca&quot; (1807); &quot;Itinerary of Greece, with a Commentary on Pausanias and Strabo&quot; (1810); and &quot;Itinerary of the Morea&quot; (1816). Although these works have been superseded by later publications, they continue to provide valuable information for the study of classical topography. He is, together with his friends Edward Dodwell and Keppel Richard Craven, by some modern scholars seen as the founder of the study of the historical topography of the hinterland of Rome. His works and notebooks proved very valuable for the topographical studies done by Thomas Ashby at the beginning of the 20th century.

<text>A qalam () is a type of reed pen. It is made from a cut, dried reed, and used for Islamic calligraphy. The pen is seen as an important symbol of wisdom in Islam, and references the emphasis on knowledge and education within the Islamic tradition.

==Etymology==
The Qalam is an Arabic word derived from the root Q-L-M, meaning nail pen or wheat.  This is ultimately a borrowing - perhaps, as Nöldeke thought, via Ge’ez - of the Greek κάλαμος, meaning a reed or reed pen.

== Manufacturing ==
The stems of hollow reeds are cut at specific angles depending on intended script so that they can be used for calligraphy, and the type of reed used varies depending on the specific calligrapher&#x27;s preferences. For example, master calligrapher Ja&#x27;far Tabrizi preferred the &quot;wāṣeṭi&quot; and &quot;āmuyi&quot; reeds of eastern Iraq and the Oxus River, respectively. It was desired that the &quot;qalam&quot; should be roughly twelve to sixteen inches long, and could not be too dry as they needed to be a specific balance of not too sturdy and not too flexible.

== Qalam in the Islamic tradition ==
The concepts of knowledge and writing are very important in Islam, and thus the &quot;qalam&quot; is revered as a symbol of wisdom and education in the Qur&#x27;an; Sura 68 is called Al-Qalam. Even in pre-Islamic societies, writing was widely used for commercial and occasionally legislative purposes. It is a commonly held belief amongst the Muslim population that disrespect of calligraphy as a tradition would reveal a person as being uneducated and unwise. In Islam, the physical presence of the written letters of the Quran functioned the way icons did to the Byzantines, as a blessing and protection. Because of this, Islamic calligraphers often had a high place in society, while their counterparts in regions like Byzantium would only be known to their family and patrons.

Calligraphy holds a central position in the Islamic artistic tradition, and because of this there exist a large variety of accessories to accompany the &quot;qalam&quot; and its user, such as pen boxes, ink wells, and knives for cutting the reeds. These tools were often very ornamented and cherished objects and reflected countless hours of other artists and craftsmen. The ink used in antiquity was most frequently black or dark brown, and was made from gum arabic, soot, gallnuts, or vitriol. Some Qurans, however, are written entirely in gold, and more contemporary calligraphers may use a wider variety of colors. Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muqla, a Persian official of the Abbasid caliphate, developed a standardized system of writing calligraphy based on the marks made with the point of a reed pen, in combination with other geometric principles. As far as other aspects of ornamentation go, metallic inks on colored parchment passed from Byzantium to Muslim Spain, and Arabic calligraphy in turn made its way back to Europe.

<doc id="648311" wikidata="Q1434805" url="?curid=648311" title="Algebraic surface">
<text>In mathematics, an algebraic surface is an algebraic variety of dimension two. In the case of geometry over the field of complex numbers, an algebraic surface has complex dimension two (as a complex manifold, when it is non-singular) and so of dimension four as a smooth manifold.

The theory of algebraic surfaces is much more complicated than that of algebraic curves (including the compact Riemann surfaces, which are genuine surfaces of (real) dimension two). Many results were obtained, but, in the Italian school of algebraic geometry , and are up to 100 years old.

== Classification by the Kodaira dimension ==

In the case of dimension one, varieties are classified by only the topological genus, but, in dimension two, one needs to distinguish the arithmetic genus formula_1 and the geometric genus formula_2 because one cannot distinguish birationally only the topological genus. Then, irregularity is introduced for the classification of varieties. A summary of the results (in detail, for each kind of surface refers to each redirection), follows:

Examples of algebraic surfaces include (κ is the Kodaira dimension):

* κ = −∞: the projective plane, quadrics in P3, cubic surfaces, Veronese surface, del Pezzo surfaces, ruled surfaces
* κ = 0 : K3 surfaces, abelian surfaces, Enriques surfaces, hyperelliptic surfaces
* κ = 1: elliptic surfaces
* κ = 2: surfaces of general type.

For more examples see the list of algebraic surfaces.

The first five examples are in fact birationally equivalent. That is, for example, a cubic surface has a function field isomorphic to that of the projective plane, being the rational functions in two indeterminates. The Cartesian product of two curves also provides examples.

== Birational geometry of surfaces ==
The birational geometry of algebraic surfaces is rich, because of blowing up (also known as a monoidal transformation), under which a point is replaced by the &quot;curve&quot; of all limiting tangent directions coming into it (a projective line). Certain curves may also be blown &quot;down&quot;, but there is a restriction (self-intersection number must be −1).

=== Castelnuovo&#x27;s Theorem ===
One of the fundamental theorems for the birational geometry of surfaces is Castelnuovo&#x27;s theorem. This states that any birational map between algebraic surfaces is given by a finite sequence of blowups and blowdowns.

== Properties ==

The Nakai criterion says that:
:A Divisor &quot;D&quot; on a surface &quot;S&quot; is ample if and only if &quot;D2 &gt; 0&quot; and for all irreducible curve &quot;C&quot; on &quot;S&quot; &quot;D•C &gt; 0.

Ample divisors have a nice property such as it is the pullback of some hyperplane bundle of projective space, whose properties are very well known. Let formula_3 be the abelian group consisting of all the divisors on &quot;S&quot;. Then due to the intersection theorem
:formula_4
is viewed as a quadratic form. Let
:formula_5
then formula_6 becomes to be a numerical equivalent class group of &quot;S&quot; and
:formula_7
also becomes to be a quadratic form on formula_8, where formula_9 is the image of a divisor &quot;D&quot; on &quot;S&quot;. (In the below the image formula_9 is abbreviated with &quot;D&quot;.)

For an ample line bundle &quot;H&quot; on &quot;S&quot;, the definition
:formula_11
is used in the surface version of the Hodge index theorem:
:for formula_12, i.e. the restriction of the intersection form to formula_13 is a negative definite quadratic form.
This theorem is proven using the Nakai criterion and the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. The Hodge index theorem is used in Deligne&#x27;s proof of the Weil conjecture.

Basic results on algebraic surfaces include the Hodge index theorem, and the division into five groups of birational equivalence classes called the classification of algebraic surfaces. The &quot;general type&quot; class, of Kodaira dimension 2, is very large (degree 5 or larger for a non-singular surface in P3 lies in it, for example).

There are essential three Hodge number invariants of a surface. Of those, &quot;h&quot;1,0 was classically called the irregularity and denoted by &quot;q&quot;; and &quot;h&quot;2,0 was called the geometric genus &quot;p&quot;&quot;g&quot;. The third, &quot;h&quot;1,1, is not a birational invariant, because blowing up can add whole curves, with classes in &quot;H&quot;1,1. It is known that Hodge cycles are algebraic and that algebraic equivalence coincides with homological equivalence, so that &quot;h&quot;1,1 is an upper bound for ρ, the rank of the Néron-Severi group. The arithmetic genus &quot;p&quot;&quot;a&quot; is the difference

:geometric genus − irregularity.

This explains why the irregularity got its name, as a kind of &#x27;error term&#x27;.

== Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces ==

The Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces was first formulated by Max Noether. The families of curves on surfaces can be classified, in a sense, and give rise to much of their interesting geometry.

<doc id="648312" wikidata="Q214145" url="?curid=648312" title="Pterophyllum">
<text>Pterophyllum is a small genus of freshwater fish from the family Cichlidae known to most aquarists as angelfish. All &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; species originate from the Amazon Basin, Orinoco Basin and various rivers in the Guiana Shield in tropical South America. The three species of &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; are unusually shaped for cichlids being greatly laterally compressed, with round bodies and elongated triangular dorsal and anal fins. This body shape allows them to hide among roots and plants, often on a vertical surface. Naturally occurring angelfish are frequently striped transversely, colouration which provides additional camouflage. Angelfish are ambush predators and prey on small fish and macroinvertebrates. All &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; species form monogamous pairs. Eggs are generally laid on a submerged log or a flattened leaf but can also be laid on filter piping when kept in an aqaurium setting. As is the case for other cichlids, brood care is highly developed.

&quot;Pterophyllum&quot; should not be confused with marine angelfish, perciform fish found on shallow ocean reefs.

==Species==
The currently recognized species in this genus are:
==History==
The freshwater angelfish (&quot;P. scalare&quot;) was described in 1824 by F. Schultze. &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; is derived from the Greek πτερον, &quot;pteron&quot; (fin/sail) and φυλλον, &quot;phyllon&quot; (leaf).

In 1906, J. Pellegrin described &quot;P. altum&quot;. In 1963, &quot;P. leopoldi&quot; was described by J. P. Gosse. Undescribed species may still exist in the Amazon Basin. New species of fish are discovered with increasing frequency, and, like &quot;P. scalare&quot; and &quot;P. leopoldi&quot;, the differences may be subtle. Scientific notations describe the &quot;P. leopoldi&quot; as having 29–35 scales in a lateral row and straight predorsal contour, whereas, &quot;P. scalare&quot; is described as having 35–45 scales in a lateral row and a notched predorsal contour. &quot;P. leopoldi&quot; shows the same coloration as &quot;P. scalare&quot;, but a faint stripe shows between the eye stripe and the first complete body stripe and a third incomplete body stripe exists between the two main (complete) body stripes that extends three-fourths the length of the body. &quot;P. scalare&#x27;s&quot; body does not show the stripe between the eye stripe and first complete body stripe at all, and the third stripe between the two main body stripes rarely extends downward more than a half inch, if even present. &quot;P. leopoldi&quot; fry develop three to eight body stripes, with all but one to five fading away as they mature, whereas &quot;P. scalare&quot; only has two in true wild form throughout life.

Angelfish were bred in captivity for at least 30 years prior to &quot;P. leopoldi&quot; being described.

==In the aquarium==
Angelfish are one of the most commonly kept freshwater aquarium fish, as well as the most commonly kept cichlid. They are praised for their unique shape, color, and behavior. It was not until the late 1920s to early 1930s that the angelfish was bred in captivity in the United States.

=== Species ===
The most commonly kept species in the aquarium is &quot;Pterophyllum scalare&quot;. Most of the individuals in the aquarium trade are captive-bred. Sometimes, captive-bred &quot;Pterophyllum altum&quot; is available. &quot;Pterophyllum leopoldi&quot; is the hardest to find in the trade.

=== Care ===
Angelfish are kept in a warm aquarium, ideally around , with soft and acidic (&lt;6.5ph) water. Though angelfish are members of the cichlid family, they are generally peaceful when not mating; however, they still may feed on very small species of fishes. Suitable tank mates include catfishes of the families Doradidae and Callichthyidae which have their own armor for protection.

=== Breeding ===
&quot;P. scalare&quot; is relatively easy to breed in the aquarium, although one of the results of generations of inbreeding is that many breeds have almost completely lost their rearing instincts, resulting in the tendency of the parents to eat their young. In addition, it is very difficult to accurately identify the sex of any individual until it is nearly ready to breed.

Angelfish pairs form long-term relationships where each individual will protect the other from threats and potential suitors. Upon the death or removal of one of the mated pair, breeders have experienced the total refusal of the remaining mate to pair up with any other angelfish and successfully breed with subsequent mates.

Depending upon aquarium conditions, &quot;P. scalare&quot; reaches sexual maturity at the age of six to 12 months or more. In situations where the eggs are removed from the aquarium immediately after spawning, the pair is capable of spawning every seven to 10 days. Around the age of three years, spawning frequency decreases and eventually ceases.

When the pair is ready to spawn, they choose an appropriate medium upon which to lay the eggs, and spend one or two days picking off detritus and algae from the surface. This medium may be a broad-leaf plant in the aquarium, a flat surface such as a piece of slate placed vertically in the aquarium, a length of pipe, or even the glass sides of the aquarium. The female deposits a line of eggs on the spawning substrate, followed by the male, which fertilizes the eggs. This process is repeated until a total of 100 to more than 1,200 eggs are laid, depending on the size and health of the female fish. As both parents care for the offspring throughout development, the pair takes turns maintaining a high rate of water circulation around the eggs by swimming very close to the eggs and fanning them with their pectoral fins. In a few days, the eggs hatch and the fry remain attached to the spawning substrate. During this period, the fry survive by consuming the remnants of their yolk sacs. At one week, the fry detach and become free-swimming. Successful parents keep close watch on the eggs until then. At the free-swimming stage, the fry can be fed suitably sized live food.

&quot;P. altum&quot; is notably difficult to breed in an aquarium environment.

=== Lifespan ===
Freshwater Angelfish with quality genetics are known to live approximately 12 years in captivity, if the ideal living conditions are provided. In the wild they are thought to live as long as 15 years if unthreatened by their numerous natural predators.

=== Compatibility with other fish ===
In pet stores, the freshwater angelfish is typically placed in the semiaggressive category. Some tetras and barbs are compatible with angelfish, but ones small enough to fit in the mouth of the angelfish may be eaten. Generous portions of food should be available so the angelfish do not get hungry and turn on their tank mates.

&quot;P. scalare&quot; and &quot;P. altum&quot; are described to be peaceful but territorial. While freshwater angelfish are often recommended for community aquaria, it has been reported that fin-nippers such as Tiger barb often target their long fins, and that freshwater angelfish become aggressive towards their companions as they grow. It is thus recommended that freshwater angelfish be kept instead in single-species aquaria.

=== Common angelfish diseases ===

==== Ich (White Spot Disease) ====
Ich, also known as &quot;White Spot Disease,&quot; is caused by the parasitic protozoan Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. Fish infected with Ich exhibit small, white, grain-like spots on their body, fins, and gills. These spots are cysts where the parasites reside. Infected fish often display signs of discomfort, frequently scratching against objects in the aquarium. The primary cause of an Ich outbreak is usually stress, which can result from factors such as poor water quality, sudden temperature changes, or the introduction of new fish without proper quarantine. To treat Ich, increasing the aquarium&#x27;s temperature gradually to for a few days can speed up the parasite&#x27;s life cycle. Simultaneously, using commercially available Ich treatments, based on copper or formalin, can be effective in eradicating the disease.

==== Fin Rot ====
Fin Rot is a common bacterial infection affecting the fins of aquarium fish. It is characterized by the fraying, discoloration, and gradual degradation of the fish&#x27;s fins, giving them a ragged appearance. If left untreated, the condition can progress from the fins to the body, leading to a more severe form known as body rot. The primary causes of fin rot are poor water quality, overcrowding, and physical damage, all of which stress the fish and make them more susceptible to infections. In terms of treatment, the first step is to improve water quality by conducting regular water changes, removing waste, and ensuring proper filtration.

==== Swim Bladder Disease ====
Swim Bladder Disease refers to a collection of issues affecting a fish&#x27;s swim bladder, the organ responsible for buoyancy. Fish afflicted with this condition may struggle to maintain their position in the water, often floating upside-down, sinking to the bottom, or swimming at unusual angles. The causes can be diverse, ranging from overfeeding, constipation, and rapid water temperature changes to physical injury and bacterial infections. To treat swim bladder disease, it&#x27;s advised to first fast the fish for 24–48 hours, followed by feeding them a diet of cooked, skinned peas, which can help alleviate constipation. If the condition is thought to be due to a bacterial infection, antibiotic treatments can be considered.

==== Bacterial Infections ====
Bacterial Infections in aquarium fish can manifest in various ways and are caused by harmful bacteria proliferating within the tank. Symptoms can range from visible ulcers, sores, and red streaks on the fish&#x27;s body to bloating, erratic swimming, and a loss of appetite. The primary triggers for bacterial infections often include poor water quality, overcrowded tanks, stress, and injuries. Overfeeding, which leads to excess waste, can also contribute to bacterial blooms. To treat bacterial infections, the first step is always to improve water conditions by conducting regular water changes, enhancing filtration, and removing any decaying organic matter. Specialized antibacterial medications, available at pet and aquarium stores, can be administered based on the specific type of bacterial infection. In severe or persistent cases, isolating the affected fish in a quarantine tank during treatment is recommended.

== Aquarium varieties ==
Most strains of angelfish available in the fishkeeping hobby are the result of many decades of selective breeding. For the most part, the original crosses of wild angelfish were not recorded and confusion between the various species of &quot;Pterophyllum&quot;, especially &quot;P. scalare&quot; and &quot;P. leopoldi&quot;, is common. This makes the origins of &quot;domestic angelfish&quot; unclear. Domestic strains are most likely a collection of genes resulting from more than one species of wild angelfish, combined with the selection of mutations in domesticated lines over the last 60 or more years. The result of this is a domestic angelfish that is a true hybrid, with little more than a superficial resemblance to wild &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; species. 
Much of the research into the known genetics of &quot;P. scalare&quot; is the result of the research of Dr. Joanne Norton, who published a series of 18 articles in &quot;Freshwater and Marine Aquarium Magazine&quot;. The genome of &quot;P. scalare&quot; was first sequenced and assembled by Indeever Madireddy, a high school student in October 2022.
*Silver (+/+): The silver angelfish most commonly resembles the wild form of angelfish, and is also referred to as &quot;wild-type&quot;. It is not, however, caught in the wild and is considered domestic. The fish has a silver body with red eyes, and three vertical black stripes that can fade or darken depending on the mood of the fish.
*Gold (g/g): The genetic trait for the gold angelfish is recessive, and causes a light golden body with a darker yellow or orange color on the crown of the fish. It does not have the vertical black stripes or the red eye seen in the wild angelfish.
*Zebra (Z/+ or Z/Z): The zebra phenotype results in four to six vertical stripes on the fish that in other ways resembles a silver angelfish. It is a dominant mutation that exists at the same locus as the stripeless gene.
*Black lace (D/+) or zebra lace (D/+ - Z/+): A silver or zebra with one copy of the dark gene results in very attractive lacing in the fins, considered by some to the most attractive of all angelfish varieties.
*Smokey (Sm/+): A variety with a dark brownish grey back half and dark dorsal and anal fins
*Chocolate (Sm/Sm): Homozygous for smokey with more of the dark pattern, sometimes only the head is silver
*Halfblack (h/h): Silver with a black rear portion, halfblack can express along with some other color genes, but not all. The pattern may not develop or express if the fish are in stressful conditions. 

*Sunset blushing (g/g S/S): The sunset blushing has two genes of gold and two genes of stripeless. The upper half of the fish exhibits orange on the best specimens. The body is mostly white in color, and the fins are clear. The amount of orange showing on the fish can vary. On some, the body is a pinkish or tangerine color. The term blushing comes from the clear gill plates found on juveniles, with pinkish gills underneath.
*Koi (Gm/Gm S/S) or (Gm/g S/S): The koi has a double or single gene of gold marble with a double gene of stripeless. Their expression of orange varies with stress levels. The black marbling varies from 5%-40% coverage.
*Leopard (Sm/Sm Z/Z) or (Sm/Sm Z/+): Leopards are very popular fish when young, having spots over most of their bodies. Most of these spots grow closer together as adults, so they look like chocolates with dots. 
*Blue blushing (S/S): This wild-type angelfish has two stripeless genes. The body is actually grey with a bluish tint under the right light spectrum. An iridescent pigment develops as they age. This iridescence usually appears blue under most lighting.
*Silver gold marble (Gm/+): A silver angel with a single gold marble gene, this is a co-dominant expression.
*Ghost (S/+): Heterozygous for stripeless results in a mostly silver fish with just a stripe through the eye and tail. Sometimes, portions of the body stripes will express.
*Gold marble (Gm/g or Gm/Gm): Depending on whether the Gold Marble is single or double dose, the marbling will range from 5% to 40% coverage.
*Marble (M/+ or M/M or M/g or M/Gm): Marble expresses with much more black pattern than gold marble. The marbling varies from 50% to 95%.
*Black hybrid (D/g or D/Gm): A cross of black with a gold, the result is black hybrids, a very vigorous black that may look brassy when young. This cross does not breed true.
*Pearlscale (p/p): Pearlscale is a scale mutation, also called the &quot;diamond&quot; angelfish in some regions due to the gem-like iridescence on its scales. The scales have a wrinkled, wavy look that reflects light to create a sparkling effect. Pearl develops slowly, starting at around 9 weeks of age. In can be inhibited by stressful conditions. It is recessive, requiring both parents to contribute the allele. 
*Black ghost (D/+ - S/+): Similar to a ghost, it has a darker appearance due to the dark gene, and very similar to a black lace without complete stripes. Ghosts generally have more iridescence than normal.
*Albino (a/a): Albino removes dark pigments in most varieties. Some, like albino marble still have a little black remaining on a percentage of the fish. The eye pupils are pink as in all albino animals. The surrounding iris can be red or yellow depending on the variety.

<text>Nachman Syrkin (also spelled &quot;Nahman Syrkin&quot; or &quot;Nahum Syrkin&quot;; ; 11 February 1868 – 6 September 1924) was a political theorist, founder of Labor Zionism and a prolific writer in the Hebrew, Yiddish, Russian, German and English languages.

==Biography==

Nachum Syrkin was born to a Lithuanian Jewish family in Mogilev, Russian Empire (now Belarus). He was influenced by Hovevei Zion and socialism in his youth and dedicated himself to synthesizing the two concepts. In this task he was joined by Ber Borochov. Syrkin&#x27;s daughter Marie was a noted writer, educator and American Zionist activist.

==Zionist career==
Syrkin was one of the leaders of the socialist Zionist faction at the First Zionist Congress in 1897 and was an early proponent of the Jewish National Fund. He was also the first person to propose that olim to Palestine form collective settlements.

Unlike other socialist thinkers of the time, Syrkin was comfortable with his Jewish heritage and, although he does not spell it out explicitly in his essay &quot;The Jewish Question and the Jewish Socialist State&quot; (1898), it is clear that he had in mind the biblical emphasis on strict social justice, irrespective of wealth, power or privilege. However, he saw Zionism as a replacement for traditional Judaism:
The new, Zionist Judaism stands in complete contrast to the Judaism of exile … Zionism uproots religious Judaism in a stronger way than Reform or assimilation, by creating new standards of &#x27;Judaism&#x27; which will constitute a new ideology that can be elevated to the status of a religion.In &quot;The Jewish Question and the Socialist Jewish State,&quot; Syrkin sought to reconcile his conception of socialism and his strong devotion to Zionism, arguing against what he considered bourgeois Zionists, such as Theodor Herzl, that only the Jewish working class could realize Zionism. He also argued against anti-Zionist Jewish socialists that there could be no solution to the Jewish problem without the creation of a Jewish state.

Syrkin worked to establish socialist Zionist groups throughout Central Europe. After studying and working in Germany and France and after being banned from Germany in 1904, Syrkin returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution of 1905. He took part at the 1905 Basle Seventh Zionist Congress as a delegate of the new Zionist Socialist Workers Party.

In 1919, Syrkin was a member of the American Jewish delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference. He was also a leading figure in the World Poale Zion conference that year and was given the task of visiting Palestine to develop a plan for kibbutz settlement. He intended to relocate to Palestine, but died of a heart attack in 1924 in New York City.

==Legacy==
In 1951, his remains were buried in the Kibbutz Kinneret beside the other founders of Labour Zionism. Kfar Sirkin, founded in 1933 close to Petach Tikva, is named for him.

==Published works (English)==

<text>A soundscape is the acoustic environment as perceived by humans, in context. The term, originally coined by Michael Southworth, was popularized by R. Murray Schafer. There is a varied history of the use of soundscape depending on discipline, ranging from urban design to wildlife ecology to computer science. An important distinction is to separate soundscape from the broader acoustic environment. The acoustic environment is the combination of all the acoustic resources, natural and artificial, within a given area as modified by the environment. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standardized these definitions in 2014. (ISO 12913-1:2014)

A soundscape is a sound or combination of sounds that forms or arises from an immersive environment. The study of soundscape is the subject of acoustic ecology or soundscape ecology. The idea of soundscape refers to both the natural acoustic environment, consisting of natural sounds, including animal vocalizations, the collective habitat expression of which is now referred to as the biophony, and, for instance, the sounds of weather and other natural elements, now referred to as the geophony; and environmental sounds created by humans, the anthropophony. The anthropophony comprises a sub-set called controlled sound, such as musical composition, sound design, and language, work, and sounds of mechanical origin resulting from use of industrial technology. Crucially, the term soundscape also includes the listener&#x27;s &quot;perception&quot; of sounds heard as an environment, which Truax describes as &quot;how that environment is understood by those living within it&quot; and therefore mediates their relations. The disruption of these acoustic environments results in noise pollution.

The term &quot;soundscape&quot; can also refer to an audio recording or performance of sounds that create the sensation of experiencing a particular acoustic environment, or compositions created using the found sounds (sounds derived from objects not standardly used for music) of an acoustic environment, either exclusively or in conjunction with musical performances.

Pauline Oliveros, composer of post-World War II electronic art music, defined the term &quot;soundscape&quot; as &quot;All of the waveforms faithfully transmitted to our audio cortex by the ear and its mechanisms&quot;.

== Historical context ==
The origin of the term soundscape is somewhat ambiguous. It is often miscredited as having been coined by Canadian composer and naturalist, R. Murray Schafer, who led much of the groundbreaking work on the subject from the 1960s and onwards. According to an interview with Schafer published in 2013, Schafer himself attributes the term to city planner Michael Southworth. Southworth, a former student of Kevin Lynch, led a project in Boston in the 1960s, and reported the findings in a paper entitled &quot;The Sonic Environment of Cities&quot; in 1969, where the term is used.

Around the same time as Southworth&#x27;s project in Boston, Schafer initiated the World Soundscape Project together with colleagues Barry Truax and Hildegard Westerkamp. Schafer subsequently collected the findings from the world soundscape project and fleshed out the soundscape concept in more detail in his seminal work about the sound environment, &quot;Tuning of the World&quot;. Schafer has also used the concept in music education.

One of Soundscape&#x27;s co-founders is Nezar Kadhem.

== In music ==

In music, soundscape compositions are often a form of electronic music or electroacoustic music. Composers who use soundscapes include real-time granular synthesis pioneer Barry Truax, Hildegard Westerkamp, and Luc Ferrari, whose &quot;Presque rien, numéro 1&quot; (1970) is an early soundscape composition. Soundscape composer Petri Kuljuntausta has created soundscape compositions from the sounds of sky dome and Aurora Borealis and deep sea underwater recordings, and a work entitled &quot;Charm of Sound&quot; to be performed at the extreme environment of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. The work landed on the ground of Titan in 2005 after traveling inside the spacecraft &quot;Huygens&quot; over seven years and four billion kilometers through space.

Irv Teibel&#x27;s &quot;Environments series&quot; (1969–79) consisted of 30-minute, uninterrupted environmental soundscapes and synthesized or processed versions of natural sound.

Music soundscapes can also be generated by automated software methods, such as the experimental TAPESTREA application, a framework for sound design and soundscape composition, and others.

The soundscape is often the subject of mimicry in timbre-centered music such as Tuvan throat singing. The process of Timbral Listening is used to interpret the timbre of the soundscape. This timbre is mimicked and reproduced using the voice or rich harmonic producing instruments.

==The environment==
In Schafer&#x27;s analysis, there are two distinct soundscapes, &quot;hi-fi&quot; and &quot;lo-fi&quot;, created by the environment. A hi-fi system possesses a positive signal-to-noise ratio. These settings make it possible for discrete sounds to be heard clearly since there is no background noise to obstruct even the smallest disturbance. A rural landscape offers more hi-fi frequencies than a city because the natural landscape creates an opportunity to hear incidences from near and afar. In a lo-fi soundscape, signals are obscured by too many sounds, and perspective is lost within the broad-band of noises. In lo-fi soundscapes everything is very close and compact. A person can only listen to immediate encounters; in most cases even ordinary sounds have to be exuberantly amplified in order to be heard.

All sounds are unique in nature. They occur at one time in one place and cannot be replicated. In fact, it is physically impossible for nature to reproduce any phoneme twice in exactly the same manner.

According to Schafer there are three main elements of the soundscape:

* Keynote sounds

: This is a musical term that identifies the key of a piece, not always audible ... the key might stray from the original, but it will return. The keynote sounds may not always be heard consciously, but they &quot;outline the character of the people living there&quot; (Schafer). They are created by nature (geography and climate): wind, water, forests, plains, birds, insects, animals. In many urban areas, traffic has become the keynote sound.

* Sound signals

: These are foreground sounds, which are listened to consciously; examples would be warning devices, bells, whistles, horns, sirens, etc.

* Soundmark

: This is derived from the term &quot;landmark&quot;. A soundmark is a sound which is unique to an area. In his 1977 book, &quot;The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World&quot;, Schafer wrote, &quot;Once a Soundmark has been identified, it deserves to be protected, for soundmarks make the acoustic life of a community unique.&quot;

The elements have been further defined as to essential sources:

Bernie Krause, naturalist and soundscape ecologist, redefined the sources of sound in terms of their three main components: geophony, biophony, and anthropophony.

* Geophony

: Consisting of the prefix, geo (gr. earth), and phon (gr. sound), this refers to the soundscape sources that are generated by non-biological natural sources such as wind in the trees, water in a stream or waves at the ocean, and earth movement, the first sounds heard on earth by any sound-sentient organism.

* Biophony

: Consisting of the prefix, bio (gr. life) and the suffix for sound, this term refers to all of the non-human, non-domestic biological soundscape sources of sound.

* Anthropophony

: Consisting of the prefix, anthro (gr. human), this term refers to all of the sound signatures generated by humans.

== In health care ==

Research has traditionally focused mostly on the negative effects of sound on human beings, as in exposure to environmental noise. Noise has been shown to correlate with health-related problems like stress, reduced sleep and cardiovascular disease. More recently however, it has also been shown that some sounds, like sounds of nature and music, can have positive effects on health, some of which might be explained by natural sounds increasing cognitive restoration and feelings of calm, for example. While the negative effects of sound has been widely acknowledged by organizations like EU (END 2002/49) and WHO (Burden of noise disease), the positive effects have as yet received less attention. The positive effects of nature sounds can be acknowledged in everyday planning of urban and rural environments, as well as in specific health treatment situations, like nature-based sound therapy and nature-based rehabilitation.

Soundscapes from a computerized acoustic device with a camera may also offer synthetic vision to the blind, utilizing human echolocation, as is the goal of the seeing with sound project.

== Soundscapes and noise pollution ==

Papers on noise pollution are increasingly taking a holistic, soundscape approach to noise control. Whereas acoustics tends to rely on lab measurements and individual acoustic characteristics of cars and so on, soundscape takes a top-down approach. Drawing on John Cage&#x27;s ideas of the whole world as composition, soundscape researchers investigate people&#x27;s attitudes to soundscapes as a whole rather than individual aspects – and look at how the entire environment can be changed to be more pleasing to the ear. This body of knowledge approaches the sonic environment subjectively as well, as in how some sounds are tolerated while others disdained, with still others preferred, as seen in Fong&#x27;s 2016 research comparing the soundscapes of Bangkok, Thailand and Los Angeles, California. To respond to unwanted sounds, however, a typical application of this is the use of masking strategies, as in the use of water features to cover unwanted white noise from traffic. It has been shown that masking can work in some cases, but that the successful outcome is dependent on several factors, like sound pressure levels, orientation of the sources, and character of the water sound.

Research has shown that variation is an important factor to consider, as a varied soundscape give people the possibility to seek out their favorite environment depending on preference, mood and other factors. One way to ensure variation is to work with &quot;quiet areas&quot; in urban situations. It has been suggested that people&#x27;s opportunity to access quiet, natural places in urban areas can be enhanced by improving the ecological quality of urban green spaces through targeted planning and design and that in turn has psychological benefits.

Soundscaping as a method to reduce noise pollution incorporates natural elements rather than just man made elements. Soundscapes can be designed by urban planners and landscape architects. By incorporating knowledge of soundscapes in their work, certain sounds can be enhanced, while others can be reduced or controlled. It has been argued that there are three main ways in which soundscapes can be designed: localization of functions, reduction of unwanted sounds and introduction of wanted sounds, each of which should be considered to ensure a comprehensive approach to soundscape design.

== In United States National Parks ==
The National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division actively protects the soundscapes and acoustic environments in national parks across the country. &quot;Acoustic resources&quot; are physical sound sources, including both natural sounds (wind, water, wildlife, vegetation) and cultural and historic sounds (battle reenactments, tribal ceremonies, quiet reverence). The &quot;acoustic environment&quot; is the combination of all the acoustic resources within a given area – natural sounds and human-caused sounds – as modified by the environment. The acoustic environment includes sound vibrations made by geological processes, biological activity, and even sounds that are inaudible to most humans, such as bat echolocation calls. &quot;Soundscape&quot; is the component of the acoustic environment that can be perceived and comprehended by the humans. The character and quality of the soundscape influence human perceptions of an area, providing a sense of place that differentiates it from other regions. &quot;Noise&quot; refers to sound which is unwanted, either because of its effects on humans and wildlife, or its interference with the perception or detection of other sounds. &quot;Cultural soundscapes&quot; include opportunities for appropriate transmission of cultural and historic sounds that are fundamental components of the purposes and values for which the parks were established.

<text>Karl Ludwig Fernow (19 November 1763 – 4 December 1808) was a German art critic and archaeologist.

==Early life==
Fernow was born in Pomerania, the son of a servant in the household of the lord of Blumenhagen. At the age of twelve he became clerk to a notary, and was afterwards apprenticed to a druggist. While serving his time he had the misfortune accidentally to shoot a young man who came to visit him; and although through the intercession of his master he escaped prosecution, the untoward event weighed heavily on his mind, and led him at the close of his apprenticeship to quit his native place.

==Art career==
He obtained a situation at Lübeck, where he had leisure to cultivate his natural taste for drawing and poetry. Having formed an acquaintance with the painter Asmus Jacob Carstens, whose influence was an important stimulus and help to him, he renounced his trade of druggist, and set up as a portrait-painter and drawing-master. At Ludwigslust he fell in love with a young girl, and followed her to Weimar; but failing in his suit, he went next to Jena. There he was introduced to Professor Reinhold, and in his house met the Danish poet Jens Immanuel Baggesen. The latter invited him to accompany him to Switzerland and Italy, a proposal which in 1794 he eagerly accepted for the sake of the opportunity of furthering his studies in the fine arts. On Baggesen&#x27;s return to Denmark, Fernow, assisted by some of his friends, visited Rome and made some stay there. He now renewed his intercourse with Carstens, who had settled at Rome, and applied himself to the study of the history and theory of the fine arts and of the Italian language and literature. Fernow&#x27;s critiques and opinions have been questioned and poorly received due to his lack of formal qualification. His personal attacks on artists are thought to reflect his own lack of artistic talent and insight. Fernow self-proclaimed to have made rapid progress, he was soon semi-qualified to give a course of lectures on archaeology, which was attended by the principal artists then at Rome. Having married a Roman lady, he returned in 1802 to Germany, and was appointed in the following year professor extraordinary of Italian literature at Jena.

==Librarian==
In 1804, he accepted the post of librarian to Amalia, Dowager Duchess of Weimar, which gave him the leisure he desired for the purpose of turning to account the literary and archaeological researches in which he had engaged at Rome. Fernow died in 1808 at Weimar, where he is buried in the Jacobsfriedhof.

==Works and biography==
His most valuable work, the &quot;Romische Studien&quot;, appeared in 3 volumes between 1806 and 1808. Among his other works are &quot;Das Leben des Kunstlers Carstens&quot; (1806), &quot;Ariostos Lebenslauf&quot; (1809), and &quot;Francesco Petrarca&quot; (1818).

A memoir of his life by Johanna Schopenhauer, mother of the philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, appeared in 1810, and a complete edition of his works in 1829.

<doc id="648326" wikidata="Q1897309" url="?curid=648326" title="Quantum Zeno effect">
<text>The quantum Zeno effect (also known as the Turing paradox) is a feature of quantum-mechanical systems allowing a particle&#x27;s time evolution to be slowed down by measuring it frequently enough with respect to some chosen measurement setting.

Sometimes this effect is interpreted as &quot;a system cannot change while you are watching it&quot;. One can &quot;freeze&quot; the evolution of the system by measuring it frequently enough in its known initial state. The meaning of the term has since expanded, leading to a more technical definition, in which time evolution can be suppressed not only by measurement: the quantum Zeno effect is the suppression of unitary time evolution in quantum systems provided by a variety of sources: measurement, interactions with the environment, stochastic fields, among other factors. As an outgrowth of study of the quantum Zeno effect, it has become clear that applying a series of sufficiently strong and fast pulses with appropriate symmetry can also &quot;decouple&quot; a system from its decohering environment.

The first rigorous and general derivation of the quantum Zeno effect was presented in 1974 by Antonio Degasperis, Luciano Fonda, and Giancarlo Ghirardi, although it had previously been described by Alan Turing. The comparison with Zeno&#x27;s paradox is due to a 1977 article by Baidyanath Misra &amp; E. C. George Sudarshan. The name comes by analogy to Zeno&#x27;s arrow paradox, which states that because an arrow in flight is not seen to move during any single instant, it cannot possibly be moving at all. In the quantum Zeno effect an unstable state seems frozen – to not &#x27;move&#x27; – due to a constant series of observations.

According to the reduction postulate, each measurement causes the wavefunction to collapse to an eigenstate of the measurement basis. In the context of this effect, an &quot;observation&quot; can simply be the &quot;absorption&quot; of a particle, without the need of an observer in any conventional sense. However, there is controversy over the interpretation of the effect, sometimes referred to as the &quot;measurement problem&quot; in traversing the interface between microscopic and macroscopic objects.

Another crucial problem related to the effect is strictly connected to the time–energy indeterminacy relation (part of the indeterminacy principle). If one wants to make the measurement process more and more frequent, one has to correspondingly decrease the time duration of the measurement itself. But the request that the measurement last only a very short time implies that the energy spread of the state in which reduction occurs becomes increasingly large. However, the deviations from the exponential decay law for small times is crucially related to the inverse of the energy spread, so that the region in which the deviations are appreciable shrinks when one makes the measurement process duration shorter and shorter. An explicit evaluation of these two competing requests shows that it is inappropriate, without taking into account this basic fact, to deal with the actual occurrence and emergence of Zeno&#x27;s effect.

Closely related (and sometimes not distinguished from the quantum Zeno effect) is the &quot;watchdog effect&quot;, in which the time evolution of a system is affected by its continuous coupling to the environment.

==Description==
Unstable quantum systems are predicted to exhibit a short-time deviation from the exponential decay law. This universal phenomenon has led to the prediction that frequent measurements during this nonexponential period could inhibit decay of the system, one form of the quantum Zeno effect. Subsequently, it was predicted that measurements applied more slowly could also &quot;enhance&quot; decay rates, a phenomenon known as the quantum anti-Zeno effect.

In quantum mechanics, the interaction mentioned is called &quot;measurement&quot; because its result can be interpreted in terms of classical mechanics. Frequent measurement prohibits the transition. It can be a transition of a particle from one half-space to another (which could be used for an atomic mirror in an atomic nanoscope) as in the time-of-arrival problem, a transition of a photon in a waveguide from one mode to another, and it can be a transition of an atom from one quantum state to another. It can be a transition from the subspace without decoherent loss of a qubit to a state with a qubit lost in a quantum computer. In this sense, for the qubit correction, it is sufficient to determine whether the decoherence has already occurred or not. All these can be considered as applications of the Zeno effect. By its nature, the effect appears only in systems with distinguishable quantum states, and hence is inapplicable to classical phenomena and macroscopic bodies.

The mathematician Robin Gandy recalled Turing&#x27;s formulation of the quantum Zeno effect in a letter to fellow mathematician Max Newman, shortly after Turing&#x27;s death:

As a result of Turing&#x27;s suggestion, the quantum Zeno effect is also sometimes known as the &quot;Turing paradox&quot;. The idea is implicit in the early work of John von Neumann on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, and in particular the rule sometimes called the &quot;reduction postulate&quot;. It was later shown that the quantum Zeno effect of a single system is equivalent to the indetermination of the quantum state of a single system.

==Various realizations and general definition==

The treatment of the Zeno effect as a paradox is not limited to the processes of quantum decay. In general, the term &quot;Zeno effect&quot; is applied to various transitions, and sometimes these transitions may be very different from a mere &quot;decay&quot; (whether exponential or non-exponential).

One realization refers to the observation of an object (Zeno&#x27;s arrow, or any quantum particle) as it leaves some region of space. In the 20th century, the trapping (confinement) of a particle in some region by its observation outside the region was considered as nonsensical, indicating some non-completeness of quantum mechanics. Even as late as 2001, confinement by absorption was considered as a paradox. Later, similar effects of the suppression of Raman scattering was considered an expected &quot;effect&quot;, not a paradox at all. The absorption of a photon at some wavelength, the release of a photon (for example one that has escaped from some mode of a fiber), or even the relaxation of a particle as it enters some region, are all processes that can be interpreted as measurement. Such a measurement suppresses the transition, and is called the Zeno effect in the scientific literature.

In order to cover all of these phenomena (including the original effect of suppression of quantum decay), the Zeno effect can be defined as a class of phenomena in which some transition is suppressed by an interaction – one that allows the interpretation of the resulting state in the terms &#x27;transition did not yet happen&#x27; and &#x27;transition has already occurred&#x27;, or &#x27;The proposition that the evolution of a quantum system is halted&#x27; if the state of the system is continuously measured by a macroscopic device to check whether the system is still in its initial state.

==Periodic measurement of a quantum system==
Consider a system in a state formula_1, which is the eigenstate of some measurement operator. Say the system under free time evolution will decay with a certain probability into state formula_2. If measurements are made periodically, with some finite interval between each one, at each measurement, the wave function collapses to an eigenstate of the measurement operator. Between the measurements, the system evolves away from this eigenstate into a superposition state of the states &quot;formula_1&quot; and &quot;formula_2&quot;. When the superposition state is measured, it will again collapse, either back into state &quot;formula_1&quot; as in the first measurement, or away into state &quot;formula_2&quot;. However, its probability of collapsing into state &quot;formula_2&quot; after a very short amount of time formula_8 is proportional to formula_9, since probabilities are proportional to squared amplitudes, and amplitudes behave linearly. Thus, in the limit of a large number of short intervals, with a measurement at the end of every interval, the probability of making the transition to &quot;formula_2&quot; goes to zero.

According to decoherence theory, the collapse of the wave function is not a discrete, instantaneous event. A &quot;measurement&quot; is equivalent to strongly coupling the quantum system to the noisy thermal environment for a brief period of time, and continuous strong coupling is equivalent to frequent &quot;measurement&quot;. The time it takes for the wave function to &quot;collapse&quot; is related to the decoherence time of the system when coupled to the environment. The stronger the coupling is, and the shorter the decoherence time, the faster it will collapse. So in the decoherence picture, a perfect implementation of the quantum Zeno effect corresponds to the limit where a quantum system is continuously coupled to the environment, and where that coupling is infinitely strong, and where the &quot;environment&quot; is an infinitely large source of thermal randomness.

==Experiments and discussion==
Experimentally, strong suppression of the evolution of a quantum system due to environmental coupling has been observed in a number of microscopic systems.

In 1989, David J. Wineland and his group at NIST observed the quantum Zeno effect for a two-level atomic system that was interrogated during its evolution. Approximately 5,000 ions were stored in a cylindrical Penning trap and laser-cooled to below 250 mK. A resonant RF pulse was applied, which, if applied alone, would cause the entire ground-state population to migrate into an excited state. After the pulse was applied, the ions were monitored for photons emitted due to relaxation. The ion trap was then regularly &quot;measured&quot; by applying a sequence of ultraviolet pulses during the RF pulse. As expected, the ultraviolet pulses suppressed the evolution of the system into the excited state. The results were in good agreement with theoretical models. 

In 2001, Mark G. Raizen and his group at the University of Texas at Austin observed the quantum Zeno effect for an unstable quantum system, as originally proposed by Sudarshan and Misra. They also observed an anti-Zeno effect. Ultracold sodium atoms were trapped in an accelerating optical lattice, and the loss due to tunneling was measured. The evolution was interrupted by reducing the acceleration, thereby stopping quantum tunneling. The group observed suppression or enhancement of the decay rate, depending on the regime of measurement.

In 2015, Mukund Vengalattore and his group at Cornell University demonstrated a quantum Zeno effect as the modulation of the rate of quantum tunnelling in an ultracold lattice gas by the intensity of light used to image the atoms.

The quantum Zeno effect is used in commercial atomic magnetometers and proposed to be part of birds&#x27; magnetic compass sensory mechanism (magnetoreception).

It is still an open question how closely one can approach the limit of an infinite number of interrogations due to the Heisenberg uncertainty involved in shorter measurement times. It has been shown, however, that measurements performed at a finite frequency can yield arbitrarily strong Zeno effects. In 2006, Streed &quot;et al.&quot; at MIT observed the dependence of the Zeno effect on measurement pulse characteristics.

The interpretation of experiments in terms of the &quot;Zeno effect&quot; helps describe the origin of a phenomenon.
Nevertheless, such an interpretation does not bring any principally new features not described with the Schrödinger equation of the quantum system.

Even more, the detailed description of experiments with the &quot;Zeno effect&quot;, especially at the limit of high frequency of measurements (high efficiency of suppression of transition, or high reflectivity of a ridged mirror) usually do not behave as expected for an idealized measurement.

It was shown that the quantum Zeno effect persists in the many-worlds and relative-states interpretations of quantum mechanics.

<doc id="648329" wikidata="Q2086136" url="?curid=648329" title="Conversion to Judaism">
<text>Conversion to Judaism ( or ) is the process by which non-Jews adopt the Jewish religion and become members of the Jewish ethnoreligious community. It thus resembles both conversion to other religions and naturalization. The procedure and requirements for conversion depend on the sponsoring denomination. Furthermore, a conversion done in accordance with one Jewish denomination is not a guarantee of recognition by another denomination. Normally, though not always, the conversions performed by more stringent denominations are recognized by less stringent ones, but not the other way around. A formal conversion is also sometimes undertaken by individuals who are raised Jewish or have Jewish ancestry but who may not be considered Jewish according to stringent interpretations of traditional Jewish law.

There are some groups that have adopted Jewish customs and practices. For example, in Russia the Subbotniks have adopted most aspects of Judaism without formal conversion to Judaism. However, if Subbotniks, or anyone without a formal conversion, wish to marry into a traditional Jewish community or immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return, they must have a formal conversion.

According to Israel Bartal, then dean of the humanities faculty of the Hebrew University, &quot;conversions to Judaism had a major impact on Jewish history in the ancient period and in the early Middle Ages&quot;.

== Terminology ==

The word &quot;ger&quot; comes from the Hebrew verb () meaning &quot;to reside&quot; or &quot;to sojourn [with]&quot;. In the Hebrew Bible &quot;ger&quot; is defined as a &quot;foreigner&quot;, or &quot;sojourner&quot;. Rabbi Marc Angel writes:
Angel&#x27;s explanation of the literal meaning of &quot;ger&quot; as alien is borne out in biblical verses such as :
Another verse which has been interpreted as referring to non-Jews converting to Judaism is Esther 8:17, although no process is described. ().

The word is rendered by the Greek &quot;proselyte&quot; as used in the Septuagint to denote a &quot;stranger&quot;.
A formal male convert to Judaism is referred to by the Hebrew word &#x27; (, plural &#x27;) and a formal female convert is a &quot;giyoret&quot;. In all branches of Judaism, a ger or giyoret is considered a full Jew; the literal meaning of &quot;stranger&quot;, &quot;resident&quot;, or &quot;foreigner&quot; refers to the convert&#x27;s origin, not present status. In Karaite Judaism the term &quot;&quot; only refers to a non-Jew who has yet to fully convert to Judaism, and once converted to Karaitism, is no longer called &quot;ger&quot;.

In the Talmud, &quot;ger&quot; is used in two senses: &quot;ger tzedek&quot; refers to a &quot;righteous convert&quot;, a proselyte to Judaism, and &quot;ger toshav&quot;, a non-Jewish inhabitant of the Land of Israel who observes the Seven Laws of Noah and has repudiated all links with idolatry. In Modern Hebrew, the unqualified term &quot;ger&quot; means &quot;ger tzedek&quot;.

==Overview==

According to Maimonides (&quot;Isurei Biah&quot; 13:14), converts were accepted since the beginning of Jewish history, and the foreign wives of Jewish leaders—such as Samson and Solomon—were converts. Yet he says (&quot;Isurei Biah&quot; 13:15) that in the times of Jewish political power, such as the days of Kings David (hypothesized to have been during the 11th or 10th centuries BCE) and Solomon (mid-10th century BCE), &quot;batei din&quot; (Jewish courts) did not accept converts who may have not had the right intention, and they had to wait and prove their intentions to be legally accepted.

With the notable exception of some Syrian Jewish communities (primarily the Brooklyn, New York, and Deal, New Jersey, communities), all mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, with all denominations accepting converts converted within their denominations. The rules vary between denominations, as does the acceptance of some denominations&#x27; converts by other denominations.

For Rabbinic Judaism, the laws governing conversion (&quot;gerut&quot;) are based on codes of law and texts, including discussions in the Talmud, through the &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot; and subsequent interpretations. (Many of the guidelines of accepting converts are based on the Book of Ruth and the manner whereby Ruth was brought into the fold through her mother-in-law, Naomi). These rules are held as authoritative by Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism.

In Judaism, proselytizing is discouraged, and religious &quot;gerut&quot; is somewhat discouraged. The majority of rabbis have traditionally rejected potential converts three times, and if the potential convert remains adamant in their desire to convert, the rabbi will then allow them to begin the process. These practices do not have any solid basis in the written text, and while they may have been the practice in some locations, it was not universal, and a number of rabbis have not followed these practices.

In order to convert, the conversion candidate must have a circumcision (if male) and immerse in the &quot;mikveh&quot; before a kosher &quot;beth din&quot;, comprising three Jewish males who are &quot;shomer Shabbat&quot;. There is also a requirement to accept the Jewish commandments (although not necessarily a commitment to keep them).

Today, the process has become more centralized, with the conversion candidate having to convince a rabbi and the &quot;beth din of&quot; their sincerity, and there will usually be a considerable amount of study. In addition to studying, potential converts are typically expected to become involved in the Jewish community. This includes attending services, participating in holidays and rituals, and building relationships with other Jews in the community. They will then be tested and formally accepted, and the convert is issued a &quot;Shtar geirut&quot; (&quot;Certificate of Conversion&quot;). As the conversion process becomes more centralized in Israel, there are only a limited number of permanent conversion courts that are acceptable to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. However, there are rabbis willing to conduct decentralized conversions and are recognized by each other. Two of the more prominent of these rabbis are Chuck Davidson and Haim Amsalem.

Conservative Judaism takes a more lenient approach to the &quot;halakhic&quot; rules than Modern Orthodox Judaism. Its approach to the validity of conversions is based on whether the conversion procedure followed Rabbinic norms rather than the reliability of those performing it or the nature of the obligations the convert undertook. Accordingly, it may accept the validity of some Reform and Reconstructionist conversions, but only if they include immersion in a ritual bath (mikvah), appearance before a rabbinical court (&quot;beit din&quot;) and, for men, circumcision (&quot;brit milah&quot;) or a symbolic circumcision for those already circumcised (&quot;hatafat dam brit&quot;).

The requirements of Reform Judaism for conversions are extremely different and far more lenient. The denomination states that &quot;people considering conversion are expected to study Jewish theology, rituals, history, culture, and customs, and to begin incorporating Jewish practices into their lives. The length and format of the course of study will vary from rabbi to rabbi and community to community. However, most now require a course in basic Judaism and individual study with a rabbi, as well as attendance at services and participation in home practice and synagogue life.&quot;

Although an infant conversion might be accepted in some circumstances, such as in the case of adopted children or children whose parents convert, children who convert would typically be asked if they want to remain Jewish after reaching religious adulthood—which is 12 years of age for a girl and 13 for a boy. This standard is applied by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, which accept &quot;Halakha&quot; as binding and normative.

Reconstructionist Judaism values the symbolism of the conversion ritual and encourages those who were not born of Jewish parents and who wish to convert to undergo this rite of passage. The Reconstructionist course of study for a prospective convert, which the rabbi and congregation determine the individual is working with, includes history, observance, beliefs, and learning to make educated choices. The completion of the process is marked by ritual immersion for men and women; circumcision or hatafat dam brit (a symbolic drop of blood) for men (unless there exists an extraordinary physical or emotional hazard); a valid &quot;beth din&quot; (in Reconstructionist conversions, dialogue with three &quot;knowledgeable Jews&quot;, at least one of whom is a rabbi), and often a public welcoming ceremony.

Karaite Judaism does not accept the Talmud and, therefore, has different requirements for conversion. Traditionally non-proselytizing, Karaite Judaism&#x27;s long-standing abstention from conversions was recently lifted. On 1 August 2007, the Karaites reportedly converted their first new members in 500 years. At a ceremony in their Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors swore fealty to Judaism after completing a year of study. This conversion comes 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.

Humanistic Judaism postulates that &quot;conversion&quot; does not suit the process of becoming a Jew, as it implies a change in belief, which is not chosen like behavioral changes. The shift is better described as naturalization, affiliation, or adoption, reflecting alterations in family ties and cultural aspirations rather than fundamental belief changes.

== In ancient times ==
Louis Feldman&#x27;s views on active Jewish missionizing have changed. While viewing classical Judaism as being receptive to converts, especially from the second century BC through the first century AD, he points to a lack of either missionizing tracts or records of the names of rabbis who sought converts as evidence for the lack of active Jewish missionizing. Feldman maintains that conversion to Judaism was common and the Jewish population was large both within the Land of Israel and in the Diaspora. Other historians believe that conversion during the Roman era was limited in number and did not account for much of the Jewish population growth, due to various factors such as the illegality of male conversion to Judaism in the Roman world from the mid-second century. Another factor that made conversion difficult in the Roman world was the halakhic requirement of circumcision, a requirement that proselytizing Christianity quickly dropped. The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax imposed on Jews in 70 AD and relaxed to exclude Christians in 96 AD, also limited Judaism&#x27;s appeal.

=== Early debate on requirement for circumcision ===
According to &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; article on circumcision of proselytes, in the first century AD, before the Mishnah was edited, the requirement for circumcision of proselytes was an open issue between the Zealots and liberal parties in ancient Israel. Joshua ben Hananiah argued that besides accepting Jewish beliefs and laws, a prospective convert to Judaism must undergo immersion in a &quot;mikveh&quot;. In contrast, Eliezer ben Hurcanus makes circumcision a condition for the conversion. A similar controversy between the Shammaites and the Hillelites is given regarding a proselyte born without a foreskin: the former demanding the spilling of a drop of blood symbolic of the Brit Milah, thereby entering into the covenant; the latter declaring it to be unnecessary.

In discussions about the necessity of circumcision for those born of a Jewish mother, lending some support to the need for circumcision of converts, the Midrash states: &quot;If thy sons accept My Godhead [by undergoing circumcision] I shall be their God and bring them into the land; but if they do not observe My covenant in regard either to circumcision or to the Sabbath, they shall not enter the land of promise&quot; (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi). &quot;The Sabbath-keepers who are not circumcised are intruders, and deserve punishment&quot; (Midrash Deut. Rabbah i).

However, the opposing view is supported in the Babylonian Talmud by Joshua ben Hananiah: &quot;A male convert who has been immersed but not circumcised, or circumcised but not immersed, is a convert.&quot; Note this view is later rejected by the Talmud.

Josephus in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Book 20 Chapter 2, recorded the story of King Izates of Adiabene who decided to follow the Law of Moses at the advice of a Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it on the grounds that the subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such &quot;strange and foreign rites&quot;. Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision (Robert Eisenman in &quot;James the Brother of Jesus&quot; claims that Ananias is Paul the Apostle, who held similar views, although this is a novel interpretation lacking support in mainstream scholarship) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, &quot;a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar,&quot; who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Second Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought much food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.

==Requirements==
The Amoraim who produced the Talmud set out basic requirements for conversion to Judaism (Keritot 8b), which must be witnessed and affirmed by a &quot;beth din (a&quot; rabbinical court composed of three Jewish males above the age of Bar Mitzvah). The judges on the Beth Din should be observant of Jewish law. Common Orthodox practice is for all of the judges to be Rabbis or Orthodox clergy. Today conversion requirements and the time required to complete conversion differ according to denomination and rabbinic sponsor. The basic requirements set out in the Talmud include:

* Circumcision (&quot;Brit milah&quot; or &quot;hatafat dam brit&quot;) for men. If the male is already circumcised, a single drop of blood is drawn as a symbolic circumcision 
* Immersion (&quot;tevilah&quot;) in a ritual bath (&quot;mikveh&quot;) for both men and women
* Offering a certain sacrifice (korban) in the Temple (the Beit Hamikdash) (this is not currently required as a part of modern conversion to Judaism)

The consensus of &quot;halakhic&quot; authorities also requires a convert to understand and formally accept the duties of classical Jewish law. This is not stated explicitly in the Talmud, but was inferred by subsequent commentators.

After confirming that all these requirements have been met, the beth din issues a &quot;Certificate of Conversion&quot; (&quot;Shtar Giur&quot;), certifying that the person is now a Jew.

==Modern practice==
The requirements for conversions vary somewhat within the different branches of Judaism, so whether or not a conversion is recognized by another denomination is often an issue fraught with religious politics. The Orthodox rejection of non-Orthodox conversions is derived less from qualms with the conversion process itself, since Conservative and even some Reform conversions are very similar to Orthodox conversions with respect to duration and content, but rather from that the Orthodox presumption that convert was not properly instructed in Jewish Law to Orthodox Jewish standards. The conflicting interpretations of whether non-Orthodox conversions are considered valid also have implications for coverts aiming to acquire Israeli citizenship as personal status in Israel is heavily influenced by the decisions of the Great Rabbinical Court in Israel, which rejects non-Orthodox conversions. Furthermore, there have been arguments made by scholars such as Hacker which argue that modern conversions are significantly influenced by the gender of the convert. This is due to the jurisdiction of the Great Rabbinical Court in Israel regarding personal status of Israeli citizens, which does not recognize inter-faith marriages and does not recognize children of paternal Jews as Jewish if the mother is not or has not converted to Orthodox Judaism. 

In general, immersion in the &quot;mikveh&quot; is an important part of a traditional conversion. If the person who is converting is male, circumcision is a part of the traditional conversion process as well. If the male who is converting has already been circumcised, then a ritual removal of a single drop of blood will take place (&quot;hatafat dam brit&quot;). However, more liberal branches of Judaism have a more relaxed requirement of immersion and circumcision.

==Maturity==
Someone who converts as a minor (younger than 12 for a girl and 13 for a boy) is required to fulfill the requirements of conversion, that is circumcision and mikvah, but are not required to perform an &#x27;acceptance of the mitzvoth&#x27;. The conversion instead is done &quot;al daat beth din&quot;, i.e. the acceptance is done by the Beth Din presiding over the conversion.
The child lives as a Jew until their bar/bat mitzvah and they then have the option of rejecting their conversion. Once they have accepted to continue as a Jew the conversion can no longer be rejected.

==Reform Jewish views==
In the United States, Reform Judaism rejects the concept that any rules or rituals should be considered necessary for conversion to Judaism. In the late 19th century, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the official body of American Reform rabbis, formally resolved to permit the admission of converts &quot;without any initiatory rite, ceremony, or observance whatsoever.&quot; (CCAR Yearbook 3 (1893), 73–95; &quot;American Reform Responsa&quot; (ARR), no. 68, at 236–237.)

Although this resolution has often been examined critically by many Reform rabbis, the resolution still remains the official policy of American Reform Judaism (CCAR Responsa &quot;Circumcision for an Eight-Year-Old Convert&quot; 5756.13 and Solomon Freehof, &quot;Reform Responsa for Our Time&quot;, no. 15.) Thus, American Reform Judaism does not require ritual immersion in a &quot;mikveh&quot;, circumcision, or acceptance of mitzvot as normative. Appearance before a Beth Din is recommended, but is not considered necessary. Converts are asked to commit to religious standards set by the local Reform community.

In actual practice, the requirements for conversion of any individual are determined by the Rabbi who sponsors the convert. Typically, Reform Rabbis require prospective converts to take a course of study in Judaism, such as an &quot;Introduction to Judaism&quot; course, to participate in worship at a synagogue, and to live as a Jew (however that is interpreted by the individual Rabbi) for a period of time. A period of one year is common, although individual Rabbis&#x27; requirements vary. When the sponsoring Rabbi feels that the candidate is ready, a Beth Din may be convened. Other rituals such as immersion in a mikvah, circumcision (or Hatafat dam brit), and a public ceremony to celebrate the conversion, are also at the discretion of the Rabbi.

==Interdenominational views==
In response to the tremendous variations that exist within the Reform community, the Conservative Jewish movement attempted to set a nuanced approach. The Conservative Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has issued a legal opinion stating that Reform conversions may be accepted as valid only when they include the minimal Conservative halachic requirements of milah and t&#x27;vilah, appearance before a Conservative Beth Din, and a course of Conservative study. (&quot;Proceedings of Committee on Jewish Law and Standards: 1980–1985&quot;, pp. 77–101.)

In general, branches of Orthodox Judaism consider non-Orthodox conversions either inadequate or of questionable halachic compliance, and such conversions are therefore not accepted by these branches of Judaism. Conversely, both Conservative and Reform Judaism accept the Orthodox conversion process as being valid. Since 2008, Haredi Orthodox religious courts in Israel have been rejecting conversions from a number of Orthodox rabbis, since the Chief Rabbinate do not accept the authority of the presiding rabbis.

==Intra-Orthodox controversy==

In 2008, a Haredi-dominated Badatz in Israel annulled thousands of conversions performed by the Military Rabbinate in Israel. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel, which is the only state-recognized authority on religious matters, backed by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ruled against this, making the annulment legally invalid for purposes of Israeli law.

==Karaite views==
As of 2006, the &quot;Moetzet Hakhamim&quot; (Council of Sages) began to accept converts to Karaite Judaism through the Karaite Jewish University. The process requires one year of learning, circumcision (for males), and the taking of the vow that Ruth took:
&quot;For whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.&quot; 
==Attempts to resolve the &quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; issue==
===1950s: proposed joint beth din===
In the 1950s Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and other members of the Rabbinical Council of America engaged in a series of private negotiations with the leaders of Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Rabbinical Assembly, including Saul Lieberman; their goal was to create a joint Orthodox-Conservative national beth din for all Jews in the United States. It would create communal standards of marriage and divorce. It was to be modeled after the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, where all the judges would have been Orthodox, while it would have been accepted by the larger Conservative movement as legitimate. Conservative rabbis in the Rabbinical Assembly created a &quot;Joint Conference on Jewish Law&quot;, devoting a year to this effort.

For a number of reasons, the project did not succeed. According to Orthodox Rabbi Louis Bernstein, the major reason for its failure was the Orthodox rabbis&#x27; insistence that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly agree to expel Conservative rabbis for actions they took prior to the formation of the new beth din, and the RA refused to do so. According to Orthodox Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, former president of the RCA, the major reason for its failure was pressure from haredi Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden. In 1956, Rabbi Harry Halpern, of the &quot;Joint Conference&quot; wrote a report on the demise of this beth din. He writes that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative denominations were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: The RA must &quot;impose severe sanctions&quot; upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before this new beth din was formed. Halpern writes that the RA &quot;could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group.&quot; He goes on to write that although subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, a letter from eleven Rosh Yeshivas was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis are forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis.

===1978–1983: Denver program, patrilineal descent ===
In Denver, Colorado, a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din was formed to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism. A number of rabbis were Orthodox and had &quot;semicha&quot; from Orthodox yeshivas, but were serving in synagogues without a mechitza; these synagogues were called &quot;traditional Judaism&quot;. Over a five-year period they performed some 750 conversions to Judaism. However, in 1983 the joint Beth Din was dissolved, due to the unilateral American Reform Jewish decision to change the definition of Jewishness:

Specifically, in 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother. The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother. However, in 2015 the majority of Britain&#x27;s Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing &quot;that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process.&quot; Britain&#x27;s Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis &quot;would be able to take local decisions – ratified by the Beit Din – confirming Jewish status.&quot;

The end of the joint Beth Din program was welcomed by Haredi Orthodox groups, who saw the program as illegitimate. Further, Haredi groups attempted to prevent non-Orthodox rabbis from following the traditional requirements of converts using a &quot;mikveh&quot;. In the Haredi view, it is better to have no conversion at all than a non-Orthodox conversion, as all non-Orthodox conversions are not true conversions at all according to them.

===1980s: proposed Israeli joint &quot;beth din&quot;===
In the 1980s Modern Orthodox Rabbi Norman Lamm, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva University, along with other American and Israeli Orthodox rabbis, worked with Conservative and Reform rabbis to come up with solution to the &quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; issue. In 1989 and 1990 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir spearheaded an effort to find a way to resolve the impasse.

A plan was developed by Israeli Cabinet Secretary Elyakim Rubenstein, who negotiated secretly for many months with rabbis from Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Judaism, including faculty at Yeshiva University, with Lamm as &quot;Rosh Yeshiva&quot;. They were planning to create a joint panel that interviewed people who were converting to Judaism and considering making &quot;aliyah&quot; (moving to the State of Israel), and would refer them to a beth din that would convert the candidate following traditional halakha. All negotiating parties came to agreement:
# Conversions must be carried out according to halakha
# the &quot;beth din&quot; (rabbinic court) overseeing the conversion would be Orthodox, perhaps appointed by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and
# there would be three-way dialogue throughout the process.

Many Reform rabbis took offense at the notion that the &quot;beth din&quot; must be strictly halakhic and Orthodox, but they acquiesced. However, when word about this project became public, a number of leading haredi rabbis issued a statement denouncing the project, condemning it as a &quot;travesty of halakha&quot;. Rabbi Moshe Sherer, Chairman of Agudath Israel World Organization, stated that &quot;Yes we played a role in putting an end to that farce, and I&#x27;m proud we did.&quot; Norman Lamm condemned this interference by Sherer, stating that this was &quot;the most damaging thing that he [Sherer] ever did in his forty year career.&quot;

Rabbi Lamm wanted this to be only the beginning of a solution to Jewish disunity. He stated that had this unified conversion plan not been destroyed, he wanted to extend this program to the area of halakhic Jewish divorces, thus ending the problem of &quot;mamzerut&quot;.

===1987: Brichto proposal===
In 1987, American-born British rabbi, Sidney Brichto, of the country&#x27;s Liberal Judaism movement, published widely-discussed proposals for a historic compromise between progressive streams of Judaism and Orthodox Judaism. He advocated for the Orthodox Beit Din to oversee contentious areas. In return, progressive rabbis would earn respect from the Orthodox rabbinate, a degree of recognition and a role in Beit Din processes concerning progressive Jewry. Brichto&#x27;s proposals encouraged rabbi John Levi to support such an initiative in Melbourne.

Among Brichto&#x27;s proposals, progressive streams of Judaism would stop processing their own conversions to Judaism. Instead, their prospective converts would have their status conferred on them by an Orthodox Beit Din. The Beit Din would be expected to show more leniency than usual, but only expecting that those before them demonstrate knowledge of Orthodox practice rather than observance.

The proposal was rejected by Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits, then Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth. Jakobovits reasoned: &quot;How can an Orthodox Beth Din validate a conversion without kabbalat mitzvot [acceptance of the commandments]?&quot;

However, in 1990, the Chief Rabbi-elect, Jonathan Sacks was more favourable to the proposal. In a letter to Brichto, he wrote: &quot;As soon as I read your article... I called it publicly &#x27;the most courageous statement by a non-Orthodox Jew this century&#x27;. I felt it was a genuine way forward. Others turned out not to share my view.&quot; He continued: &quot;It will be a while - 18 months - before I take up office. But I believe we can still explore that way forward together. For if we do not move forward, I fear greatly for our community and for Am Yisrael.&quot;

===1997: Neeman Commission proposal===
In 1997 the issue of &quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; again arose in the State of Israel, and Orthodox leaders such as Rabbi Norman Lamm publicly backed the Neeman commission, a group of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform rabbis working to develop joint programs for conversion to Judaism. In 1997 Lamm gave a speech at the World Council of Orthodox Leadership, in Glen Springs, New York, urging Orthodox Jews to support this effort:

The committee recommended the establishment of a joint institute for Jewish studies, which would be a joint effort by all three streams of Judaism. The committee also recommended that conversion proceedings themselves be held in special conversion courts, to be recognized by all denominations in Judaism. The purpose of the proposal was to prevent a rift in the Jewish people, while at the same time bringing about a state-sponsored arrangement for conversion. On 7 September 1998, the government adopted the Ne&#x27;eman Commission Report.

A year later, the Joint Institute for Jewish Studies was established, and since then it has been the official state operator of conversion courses in Israel, including the military conversion courses. In 2015 the institute&#x27;s name was changed to Nativ – The National Center for Jewish Studies, Identity and Conversion.

===Conversion annulments===
A recent development has been the idea of annulling conversions to Judaism, sometimes many years after they have taken place, due to a reduction in religious observance or change of community by the convert. Chuck Davidson, a Modern Orthodox expert on this conversion crisis explains &quot;From the Middle Ages onwards, the greatest of the rabbis wrote explicitly that even if immediately after the conversion the convert goes off to worship idols, the person is still considered Jewish.&quot; The justification given for the change in approach is that the original conversion must never have been valid in the first place as it is clear from the convert&#x27;s subsequent actions they were insincere at the time of conversion.

A situation of confusion in Jewish identity in Israel was made worse when Haredi Rabbi Avraham Sherman of Israel&#x27;s supreme religious court () called into question the validity of over 40,000 Jewish conversions when he upheld a ruling by the Ashdod Rabbinical Court to retroactively annul the conversion of a woman who came before them because in their eyes she failed to observe Jewish law.

This crisis deepened, when Israel&#x27;s Rabbinate called into question the validity of soldiers who had undergone conversion in the army, meaning a soldier killed in action could not be buried according to Jewish law. In 2010, the rabbinate created a further distrust in the conversion process when it began refusing to recognize orthodox converts from the United States as Jewish. Indeed, the great-niece of the renowned Zionist Nahum Sokolow was recently deemed &quot;not Jewish enough&quot; to marry in Israel, after she failed to prove the matrilineal Jewish descent for four generations.

Following a scandal in which U.S. Rabbi Barry Freundel was arrested on charges of installing hidden cameras in a &quot;mikveh&quot; to film women converts undressing, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate said it would review the validity of all past conversions performed by Freundel, then quickly reversed its decision, clarifying that it was joining the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America in affirming the validity of the conversions.

In December 2014 an Israeli court decided that a conversion could be annulled. In his decision Justice Neal Hendel wrote: &quot;Just as the civil court has the inalienable authority to reverse – in extremely rare cases – a final judgment, so too does the special religious conversion court. For otherwise, we would allow for judgments that are flawed from their inception to exist eternally.&quot;

==Consequences==
Once undergone, a valid religious conversion to Judaism cannot be overturned. However, a Beth Din may determine that the conversion is void as it was never undertaken correctly in the first place. For example, if the rite of &quot;mikveh&quot; was performed incorrectly. In recent years, many Orthodox conversions have been overturned. In 2008 Israel&#x27;s highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi. Debate on what constitutes a valid Beth Din for conversion and for annulling conversions has caused divisions in the Orthodox world. It is an implicit judgment on the character and uprightness of the rabbis in that religious court. For example, when Rabbi Barry Freundel was arrested on charges of voyeurism for filming women converts at the &quot;mikveh&quot; he supervised, Israel&#x27;s Chief Rabbinate initially threatened to review and possibly invalidate the conversions Freundel had been involved in approving. A crisis between American and Israeli rabbis was averted when the Chief Rabbinate agreed that all conversions completed by Freundel would be considered valid.

===Relations between Jews and proselytes===
Judaism is not an openly proselytizing religion. Judaism teaches that the righteous of all nations have a place in the afterlife. Much like in the other Abrahamic faiths, Jewish law requires the sincerity of a potential convert. In view of the foregoing considerations, most authorities are very careful about it. Essentially, they want to be sure that the convert knows what they are getting into, and that they are doing it for sincerely religious reasons. However, while conversion for the sake of love for Judaism is considered the best motivation, a conversion for the sake of avoiding intermarriage is gaining acceptance also.

There is a tradition that a prospective convert should be turned away three times as a test of sincerity, though most rabbis no longer follow the tradition. Neither the Rabbinical Council of America nor the Rabbinical Assembly, the leading American Orthodox and Conservative organizations, suggest taking this action in their conversion policies, with the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) and Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) actively opposing its practice.

===Halakhic considerations===
Halakha forbids the mistreatment of a convert, including reminding a convert that they were once not a Jew. Hence, little to no distinction is made in Judaism between those who are born Jewish and those who are Jewish as a result of conversion. However, despite Halakha protecting the rights of converts, some Jewish communities have been accused of treating converts as second-class Jews. For example, many communities of Syrian Jews have banned conversion and refuse to recognise any Jewish conversion, including those done under Orthodox auspices (possibly influenced by sects in Syria like the Druze which do not accept converts).

According to Orthodox interpretations of Halakha, converts face a limited number of restrictions. A marriage between a female convert and a kohen (members of the priestly class) is prohibited and any children of the union do not inherit their father&#x27;s kohen status. While a Jew by birth may not marry a mamzer, a convert can. Descendants of converts can become rabbis. For instance, Rabbi Meir Baal Ha Nes is thought to be a descendant of a proselyte. Rabbi Akiva was also a very well-known son of converts. The Talmud lists many of the Jewish nation&#x27;s greatest individuals who had either descended from or were themselves converts. Asenath, the wife of Joseph (son of Jacob), is mentioned as a possible convert. There are Midrash attesting to her conversion along with other women. This includes Hagar, Zipporah, Shiphrah, Puah, the Daughter Of Pharaoh, Rahab, Ruth, and Jael. In fact, King David is descended from Ruth, a convert to Judaism. () In Orthodox and Conservative communities that maintain tribal distinctions, converts become &quot;Yisraelim&quot; (Israelites), ordinary Jews with no tribal or inter-Jewish distinctions. Converts typically follow the customs of their congregations. So, a convert who prays at a Sephardi synagogue would follow Sephardi customs and learn Sephardi Hebrew.

A convert chooses his or her own Hebrew first name upon conversion but is traditionally known as the son or daughter of Abraham and Sarah, the first patriarch and matriarch in the Torah, often with the additional qualifier of &quot;Avinu&quot; (our father) and &quot;Imenu&quot; (our mother). Hence, a convert named Akiva would be known, for ritual purposes in a synagogue, as &quot;Akiva ben Avraham Avinu&quot;; in cases where the mother&#x27;s name is used, such as for the prayer for recovery from an illness, he would be known as &quot;Akiva ben Sarah Imenu&quot;.

Talmudic opinions on converts are numerous; some positive, some negative. A quote from the Talmud labels the convert &quot;hard on Israel as a scab&quot;. Many interpretations explain this quote as meaning converts can be unobservant and lead Jews to be unobservant or converts can be so observant that born Jews feel ashamed.

==Jews by choice==
The term &quot;Jews by choice&quot; is often used to describe people who chose to convert to Judaism, many of whom have no ancestral connection to the Jewish people. It is often contrasted with such terms as &quot;Jew by birth&quot; (or &quot;Jew by chance&quot;). The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of reincarnation. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may &quot;wander among nations&quot; through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a &quot;lost&quot; Jewish ancestor.

==Bnei Anusim==
In recent decades, there has been a renewed Jewish conversion interest with some Bnei Anusim, that is, the descendants of Jews who were forced to convert to other faiths.

The Hebrew term for forced converts is &quot;Anusim&quot; (lit. &quot;forced [converts]&quot;), while the descendants of said converts are called &quot;Bnei Anusim&quot; (lit. &quot;children of forced [converts]&quot;).

In the modern era, the single most notable and numerous group of Bnei Anusim converts are the Sephardic Bnei Anusim, descendants of those Sephardic Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity during the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition. They are found throughout Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Iberoamerica (the Hispanic countries of the Americas plus Brazil). There has been a continuous steady growth among them who are now prospective converts, actively seeking conversions back to Judaism.

Since many Bnei Anusim (i.e. descendants of forced converts) lack an unbroken matrilineal Jewish line of descent or lack satisfactory documentary evidence to that effect (even if they can prove Jewish ancestry along one or all other of their lineages besides their direct matrilineal lineage), conversion has been a growing option for them to return to Judaism.

<doc id="648338" wikidata="Q28195039" url="?curid=648338" title="El Show de las 12">
<text>El Show de las 12 was a Puerto Rican midday variety television series airing on WKAQ-TV, and later on the nationwide Telemundo network, and hosted by Eddie Miro for most of its run. It aired every week-day for 40 years until its cancellation on February 25, 2005.

== History ==

Paquito Cordero was working for El Mundo Enterprises as the company launched the first television station in Puerto Rico WKAQ-TV also known as Telemundo in 1964. Cordero approached station owner, Angel Rámos with the idea for a variety show that would feature music and comedy. Rámos accepted the idea and thus &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; (&quot;The 12 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;) was born with its first episode airing on January 11, 1965

The show would air live every day at noon from studio two at WKAQ-TV studios in San Juan, Puerto Rico and would air in front of a live studio audience of about 300 people that were given admission for free into the program. In 1995, WKAQ decided to name the studio after the creator and long time executive producer of the program, henceforth the space would be known as &quot;Estudio 2: Paquito Cordero&quot; (Studio 2: Paquito Cordero). Today the studio is home to comedian Raymond Arrieta&#x27;s show &quot;Raymond y sus Amigos&quot; (Raymond and Friends)

=== Music ===

&quot;El Show de las 12&quot; was known for its live music performances. Every day the show would kickoff with a live performance from an up and coming musical act. Many iconic Puerto Rican and International musicians had their first televised performance on &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; including El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, Marc Anthony, Menudo, Conjunto Quisqueya, Chayanne, Raphael, Julio Iglesias, among others. Throughout its run &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; became a pivotal platform to launch music stars in Puerto Rico and for those Latino stars to breakthrough in the United States.

=== Comedy ===

Just as it helped launch the careers of countless music stars, &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; was also significant in helping many Puerto Rican comedians breakthrough. When there wasn&#x27;t music playing, comedians would be performing skits and recurring segments on the show. &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; was the starting ground for legendary Puerto Rican comedians such as Awilda Carbia, Shorty Castro, Otilio Warrington, Luis Antonio Cosme, Ángela Meyer, Raulito Carbonell, among others.

=== La Comay ===

In 1989, after becoming a recurring character on rival station WAPA-TV alongside Luisito Vigoreaux the character of &quot;La Condesa del Bochinche&quot; (The Countess of Gossip), a gossip reporting puppet controlled by Kobbo Santarrosa, made the jump to WKAQ-TV and was given a segment on &quot;El Show de las 12&quot;. The segment was originally not well received and the character went through an overhaul changing the look of the puppet and renaming it &quot;La Comay&quot; (The Godmother). La Comay would share her segment with the host of &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; Eddie Miró who would encourage the character to share more details of the gossip they were presenting. This version of the character became a success and would eventually receive a spinoff show called XClusivo (Exclusive) that would air on Thursdays at 9:30 p.m. with Miró also serving as a co-host. Eventually the character&#x27;s success led Santarrosa back to WAPA-TV where the show SuperXclusivo was born, Miró received an offer to join Santarrosa on WAPA-TV but he cited his loyalty to &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; and WKAQ-TV as a reason to refuse the offer.

=== Cancellation and legacy ===

By the early 2000s &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; and WKAQ-TV as a whole was experiencing a sharp decline. In 2001, NBC Universal would acquire Telemundo and its Owned-and-operated stations with the company officially becoming the sole owner of WKAQ-TV in 2004.

The acquisition by NBC Universal brought harsh cost cutting measures for WKAQ-TV. The parent company decided to scrap all local programming in favor of cheap imported international shows which in turn meant the cancellation of &quot;El Show de las 12&quot;. On February 25, 2005, just a month after celebrating the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary, &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; aired its final episode. Due to the show being a daily live show that began in the early 60s most of the tapes of the show were lost in time, however, the surviving tapes of the program were donated to the school of communications at the University of Puerto Rico along with every other tape of Paquito Cordero Productions upon Cordero&#x27;s death in 2009. WKAQ-TV has christened two of its studios with the names of figures of &quot;El Show de las 12&quot;, Studio 2 (where &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; used to take place) carries the name of Paquito Cordero and Studio 3 (where Puerto Rico Gana and Rayos X broadcasts from) carries the name Eddie Miró.

On January 16, 2017, twelve years after the cancellation of &quot;El Show de las 12&quot;, WKAQ-TV began airing a midday variety program again. &quot;Alexandra a las 12&quot; (Alexandra at Noon) is hosted by Alexandra Fuentes and features interviews, news, political analysis and, comedy segments. Though it does not feature daily musical performances nor a live studio audience (the show broadcasts from the station&#x27;s news studio) it is the spiritual successor to &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; and has seen moderate success for WKAQ-TV on the time slot. The show was expanded to start at 11:30 a.m. in 2021.

<text>Histadrut, fully the New General Workers&#x27; Federation () and until 1994 the General Federation of Labour in the Land of Israel (, &quot;HaHistadrut HaKlalit shel HaOvdim B&#x27;Eretz Yisrael&quot;), is Israel&#x27;s national trade union center and represents the majority of Israel&#x27;s trade unionists.

Established in December 1920 in Mandatory Palestine, it soon became one of the most powerful institutions in the Yishuv (the body of Jewish residents in the region prior to the establishment of the state). Today, it has 800,000 members.

==History==
The Histadrut was founded in December 1920 in Haifa to look out for the interests of Jewish workers. Until 1920, Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapoel Hatzair had been unable to set up a unified workers organisation. In 1920, Third Aliyah immigrants founded Gdud HaAvoda and demanded a unified organization for all Jewish workers, which led to the establishment of the Histadrut. At the end of 1921 David Ben-Gurion was elected as Secretary. Membership grew from 4,400 in 1920 and to 8,394 members in 1922. In 1926 the Histadrut supported an art studio in Tel Aviv. By 1927, the Histadrut had around 22,000 members, accounting for 68% of the Jewish workforce in Mandatory Palestine. In 1939, its membership stood at about 100,000, or about 75% of the Jewish workforce.

===Labor Zionism===
More important than the 1917 American Federation of Labor (AFL) resolution recognizing &quot;the legitimate claims of the Jewish people for the establishment of a national homeland in Palestine on the basis of self-government&quot;, was the grassroots campaign to finance Histadrut land purchases, infrastructure development and the establishment of farm cooperatives. Jewish garment workers in the US in the early 20th century looked more to local improvements than the promises of Labor Zionism. The symbolic AFL endorsement of the Balfour Declaration failed to advance Zionist goals on the ground and many Jewish labor leaders were opposed to Zionist endeavors until the 1920 founding of Histadrut began to change their views. Within three years some labor leaders had reversed their positions, calling for moral and financial support for Histadrut. The garment unions Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and International Ladies Garment Workers Union extended their support to Histadrut.

The Histadrut became one of the most powerful institutions in the state of Israel, a mainstay of the Labour Zionist movement and, aside from being a trade union, its state-building role made it the owner of a number of businesses and factories.

Until Israel began moving away from a socialist economy, the Histadrut, along with the government, owned most of the economy. It was the second largest employer in the country next to the government itself via its many cooperative enterprises. Through its economic arm, &quot;Hevrat HaOvdim&quot; (&quot;Society of Workers&quot;), the Histadrut owned and operated numerous enterprises, including the country&#x27;s largest industrial conglomerates, the country&#x27;s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim, and the country&#x27;s largest shipping company, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services. The Israeli services sector was completely dominated by the Histadrut and government, and the Histadrut also largely dominated the public transport, agriculture, and insurance industries. In addition, it owned Clalit Health Services, Israel&#x27;s largest Kupat Holim, or health insurance and medical services fund. Clalit was the only health fund in the country to accept members without discriminating based on their age or medical situation, but with the condition that they must also be members of the Histadrut labor union. As such, many Israelis were dependent on Histadrut membership for their health insurance. In the mid-1980s, an estimated 70% of the Israeli population was insured by Clalit.

===Neoliberalism===
With the increasing liberalization and deregulation of the Israeli economy since the 1980s, the role and size of Histadrut declined. Hyperinflation saddled its business empire with enormous debts, and slow economic growth exposed its inefficiencies. Due to debts, the Histadrut began giving up its business holdings. It lost control of Bank Hapoalim in the aftermath of the 1983 Israel bank stock crisis, when the Israeli government nationalized it along with other major banks. 

A notable shift in power took place in 1994 when the Labor Party lost its leadership and governing role in the Histadrut, and a new party named RAM, composed of individuals who had left the Labor Party due to internal power struggles, took charge and began to sell off or eliminate its non-union-related assets and activities, proclaiming that from then on, it would function solely as a trade union. The most severe blow came when Israel&#x27;s National Health Insurance Law came into effect in 1995, instituting a national universal health care framework and reorganizing the Israeli healthcare system. Under the law, Clalit Health Services&#x27; tie to the Histadrut was severed and Israelis were given a choice in membership between Clalit and the three other Israeli health insurance funds, which were now prohibited from discriminating against applicants for age and medical reasons. Once an affiliation with the Histadrut was no longer a prerequisite for membership in Clalit, many of its insured dropped their labor union membership, while others switched to other health funds now that age or pre-existing conditions no longer precluded them from joining. This resulted in one of the largest declines in union membership in labor history. The Histadrut&#x27;s membership plunged almost instantly from 1.8 million (almost 80% of the workforce at the time) to about 200,000 members. The loss of revenue generated from Clalit&#x27;s health insurance premiums and union dues caused an enormous decline in the Histadrut&#x27;s resources, and it was forced to sell off valuable real estate assets to survive.

===Membership===
Membership in 1983 was 1,600,000 (including dependents), accounting for more than one-third of the total population of Israel and about 85% of all wage earners. About 170,000 Histadrut members were Arabs (who were admitted to membership starting in 1953). In 1989, the Histadrut was the employer of approximately 280,000 workers.

The Histadrut managed to recover from its low point in membership and gradually grow in membership. In 2005, it had about 650,000 members. The Histadrut still remains a powerful force in Israeli society and the economy. In 2017 it had 570,000 members and a total of 700,000 workers being employed under collective agreements it had negotiated with employers in the country.

===Recent===
Following its support of the 2011 Israeli social justice protests, on February 8, 2012, Histadrut called a general strike in support of lower-paid subcontracted, and unorganized workers, negotiating with both the government and private employers on their behalf, demanding that the subcontracted workers be hired directly and be offered the pay and benefits granted to regular employees. A settlement was announced on Sunday, February 12, which provided for some gains by the subcontractors, but also for a 3-year moratorium on further strikes over subcontractor issues.

In 2016, 27% of the workforce was a member of this union. During the 2023 Israeli judicial reform protests the Chairperson of the Histadrut, Anon Bar-David, declared a unionwide strike following the announcement of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s intention to dismiss Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. The strike was called off on the same day after Netanyahu announced he will be entering negotiations with the opposition regarding the judicial reform and halt the legislation. Several days later, a report by journalist Michael Shemesh alleged that the strike was coordinated with the Prime Minister&#x27;s office in order for Netanyahu to be able to apply pressure on his coalition members to halt the legislation.

==Goals==
The initial aim of the Histadrut was to take responsibility for all spheres of activity of the worker&#x27;s movement: settlement, defense, trade unions, education, housing construction, health, banking, cooperative ventures, welfare and even culture. The Histadrut took over economic firms operated by the parties, which operated by subcontracting, and their Office of Information, which was expanded into a Labor Exchange. Already after a few months, the Histadrut became the single largest employer in the Yishuv. The Histadrut succeeded in improving worker&#x27;s rights as e.g. the right to strike was recognised, employers had to motivate dismissal and workers got a place to turn to with their complaints.

In the first year of its existence, the Histadrut lacked central leadership, and many initiatives were taken at the local level. This changed after David Ben-Gurion became appointed in the General Secretariat. Ben-Gurion wanted to transform the Histadrut into a national instrument for the realisation of Zionism. According to Zeev Sternhell Ben-Gurion&#x27;s exclusive commitment to this goal is illustrated by a December 1922 quote:
[...] Our central problem is immigration ... and not adapting our lives to this or that doctrine. [...] How can we run our Zionist movement in such a way that [... we] will be able to carry out the conquest of the land by the Jewish worker, and which will find the resources to organise the massive immigration and settlement of workers through their own capabilities? The creation of a new Zionist movement, a Zionist movement of workers, is the first prerequisite for the fulfillment of Zionism. [...] Without [such] a new Zionist movement that is entirely at our disposal, there is no future or hope for our activities
Ben-Gurion transformed the Histadrut in a few months. He set up a well-defined hierarchy and reduced the competencies of local workers&#x27; councils. He also centralised the collection of membership dues, most of which were formerly used up by local branches.

Absorption of immigration was seen as a very important task of the Histadrut. Providing immigrants with work was often seen as more important than the financial soundness of its operations. The labor leaders saw the failure to absorb immigrants as a moral bankruptcy that was much worse than financial bankruptcy. In 1924 the Histadrut&#x27;s Office for Public Works collapsed and went bankrupt, and in 1927 the same happened to its successor, the privatised Solel Boneh. In both cases, the Zionist Executive bailed them out and recognised the deficit in the category of &quot;expenses for immigration absorption&quot;. The Zionist Executive, sharing the goal of stimulating immigration with the Histadrut, had to do this because besides the Histadrut there was no other organisation in Palestine with the ability to absorb immigrants.

By 1930 the Histadrut had become the central organisation of the Yishuv. It did what the Zionist Executive wanted, but was unable to do: absorb immigrants and organise the agricultural settlement, defense and expansion into new areas of production. According to Tzahor the Histadrut had become &quot;the executive arm of the Zionist movement—but an arm acting on its own&quot;. It had become a &quot;state in the making&quot;.

According to Tzahor, while the Histadrut focused on constructive action, its leaders did not &quot;abandon fundamental ideological principles&quot;. However, according to Ze&#x27;ev Sternhell in his book &quot;The Founding Myths of Israel&quot;, the labor leaders had already abandoned socialist principles by 1920 and only used them as &quot;mobilizing myths&quot;.

==Leadership==
The chairman of the Histadrut today is Arnon Bar-David.

==Criticism==
The Histadrut has been criticized by European trade unions and international human rights groups over its failure to represent migrant workers, considered to be the most maltreated employees in Israel. In 2009, the Histadrut began accepting memberships of migrant workers. Another criticism of the Histadrut is that it appears to protect powerful interest groups in the labor market, i.e., that it does not protect all workers.

<text>The first USS &quot;Shreveport&quot; (PG-131/PF-23) was a of the United States Navy.

She was laid down under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1434) on 8 March 1943 by Walter Butler Shipbuilders, Inc., in Superior, Wisconsin; reclassified PF-23 on 15 April 1943; launched on 15 July 1943, sponsored by Miss Nell Querbes; and commissioned on 24 April 1944 at Algiers, Louisiana.

==Service history==
Following shakedown off Bermuda, &quot;Shreveport&quot; arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, on 9 November 1944. Conversion to a weather ship followed (the after 3-inch gun was removed and a weather balloon hangar was added); and on 2 March 1945, she departed Boston and headed north to assume weather reporting and aircraft lifeguard duties in the North Atlantic.

Operating on stations between Newfoundland and Iceland, she completed her North Atlantic service in the fall and moved south, to Recife, Brazil, whence she conducted similar patrols from December 1945 until March 1946. She sailed for the United States on 8 March; was transferred to the operational control of the Coast Guard while en route; arrived at Boston on the 23rd; then, steamed to Charleston, South Carolina, for inactivation.

&quot;Shreveport&quot; was decommissioned on 9 May 1946; struck from the Navy list on 10 June; and sold for scrapping to the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania, in September 1947.

<text>Carlo Fea (4 June 1753 - 18 March 1836) was an Italian archaeologist.

== Biography ==

Born at Pigna, in Liguria, Fea studied law in Rome, receiving the degree of doctor of laws from the university of La Sapienza, but archaeology gradually attracted his attention, and with the view of obtaining better opportunities for his research in 1798 he took Holy Orders and became an Abbott. For political reasons he was forced to take refuge in Florence; on his return to Rome in 1799 he was imprisoned as a Jacobin by the Neapolitans, who at that time were occupying Rome, but was shortly afterwards freed and appointed &quot;Commissario delle Antichità&quot; and librarian to Prince Sigismondo Chigi. At Rome in 1781 Fea discovered a statue of a discus thrower, the so-called &quot;Discobolus&quot;, one of the known Roman copies of the famous Greek original statue in bronze created by Myron.

Fea helped frame legislation to control the trade in, and excavation of, the antiquities of Rome, and undertook archaeological work on the Pantheon and the Forum there.

Fea revised and annotated an Italian translation of Johann Joachim Winckelmann&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Kunst&quot;, and also annotated some of the works of Giovanni Ludovico Bianconi. Among his original writings he is best known for: &quot;Miscellanea filologica, critica, e antiquaria&quot;; and &quot;Descrizione di Roma Antica e Moderna&quot;.

Despite being qualified to do so, Fea never used the title of Abbott but rather that of a lawyer (Avv).

He died in Rome on the night of March 17, 1836, in the Palazzo Chigi.

<text>Luigi Canina (Casale Monferrato, 1795 – Florence, 1856) was an Italian archaeologist and architect.

Luigi Canina, an Italian architect and archaeologist, was born in Casale Monferrato in 1795 and died in Florence in 1856. He was a pupil of Ferdinando Bonsignore in Turin, and settled in Rome in 1818. Among his works are: some construction at the Villa Borghese (monumental neoclassical propylaea from Piazzale Flaminio); Casino Vagnuzzi outside of Porta del Popolo in Egyptian style; not realized projects for reconstruction of the sanctuary of Oropa (1856). He became professor of architecture at Turin, and his most important works were the excavation of Tusculum in 1829 and of the Appian Way in 1848, the results of which he embodied in a number of works published in a costly form by his patroness, the queen of Sardinia. In 1843, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary member.

Canina is also noted for his studies of history and archaeology: &quot;Ancient architecture described and represented in documents&quot; (1830–44). A column opposite the basilica of Saint Sebastian on the Appian Way close to Rome records Canina&#x27;s work in rescuing many Roman ruins and turning the road into the archaeological park that it is today.

In England, he restored interiors at Alnwick Castle, Northumberland.

<text>The Chamber of Deputies &quot;(Cámara de Diputados)&quot; is the lower house of Paraguay&#x27;s bicameral legislature, the National Congress. It is made up of 80 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation. The other chamber of the National Congress (&quot;Congreso Nacional&quot;) is the Chamber of Senators (&quot;Cámara de Senadores&quot;).

Unicameral congress was established in 1813, and replaced with bicameral congress including Chamber of Deputies and the Senate in 1870. In 1940, unicameral Chamber of Representatives was formed, and since 1967 there has been a bicameral legislature.

<text>United Supermarkets, LLC, d.b.a. The United Family is an American supermarket chain. With headquarters in Lubbock, Texas, its roots go back to 1916, when H.D. Snell opened his first United Cash Store in Sayre, Oklahoma. The chain has grown to include 95 stores in 30 Texas cities and over 10,000 workers. In 2014 it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albertsons.

==History==
United Supermarkets has 94 stores located in Texas and New Mexico. While it shares the same name as United Supermarkets based in Oklahoma (owned by Homeland), it technically does business as The United Family to differentiate from the Oklahoma chain, as they are separate grocery entities.

On April 1, 2009, United opened its 50th store in Plano, Texas.

Most United Supermarkets stores operate from 6 or 7 am until 11 pm, seven days a week. As of February 1, 2016, four stores operate 24 hours a day, including the pharmacy: two stores in Lubbock, one in Wichita Falls, and one in Frisco (Of which is no longer a 24-hour location as of 2019). Two stores were open 24 hours a day temporarily after the opening of the new store. Both were located in Lubbock.

United Supermarkets is run by the Albertsons chain, and operates as a division of Albertsons.

===Acquisition===
On September 9, 2013, United Supermarkets LLC was sold to Albertsons LLC. On February 4, 2014, the FTC voted 4–0 to approve the deal. The acquisition deal cost Albertsons $385 million and required Albertsons to sell its single stores in the Amarillo and Wichita Falls, Texas, markets. As part of the acquisition, several Albertsons locations in Eastern New Mexico, which were re-branded as &quot;Albertsons Market&quot;, were added to the new United division of Albertsons-Safeway. Expansion in New Mexico continued with the purchase of several Lawrence Brothers locations, and the transfer of stores in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, and Taos, to the United division.

The United Family operates five distinct retail banners:

* United Supermarket - traditional grocery offerings
* Market Street - take-out foods, restaurants, gourmet, and everyday grocery items
* Amigos United - international and American foods
* United Express - take-out foods, café, and gas station
* Albertsons Market - traditional American grocery

==Naming rights==
United Supermarkets owns the naming rights to United Supermarkets Arena at Texas Tech University. The arena is the home court for the university&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams in addition to its women&#x27;s volleyball team.

<doc id="648377" wikidata="Q14903417" url="?curid=648377" title="Delhaize Group">
<text>Delhaize Group SA (, ) was a Belgian multinational retail company headquartered in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, Brussels, Belgium, and operated in seven countries and on three continents. The principal activity of Delhaize Group was the operation of food supermarkets. On 24 June 2015, Delhaize reached an agreement with Ahold to merge and form a new parent/holding company headquartered in the Netherlands: Ahold Delhaize.

==History==
Delhaize was founded near Charleroi, Belgium, in 1867 by Jules Delhaize and his brothers Auguste, Edouard and Adolphe. He was helped in this endeavor by his future brother-in-law, Jules Vieujant. For their new shop, they chose the lion, the symbol of strength, as their logo. They also chose a motto: unity is strength.
In 2005, Delhaize Group completed the acquisition of the Belgian supermarket chain Cash Fresh for 118.6 million euros. Delhaize paid an additional 51 million euros to acquire real estate assets of Cash Fresh.

As of 31 December 2014, Delhaize Group had a sales network (which includes directly operated, franchised, and affiliated stores) of 3,402 stores and employed approximately 150,000 people (excluding the stores and related associates of divested and discontinued operations). Store formats are primarily supermarkets, which represent 85% of Delhaize Group&#x27;s sales network. Delhaize Group&#x27;s sales network also includes other store formats such as neighborhood stores, convenience stores, and specialty stores. The company is actively engaged with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Energy Star program to manage energy efficiency across its U.S. facilities.

In addition to food retailing, Delhaize Group engages in food wholesaling to stores in its sales network and in nonfood retailing of products such as pet products and health and beauty products.

In 2014, Delhaize Group recorded revenue of €21.4 billion and underlying operating profit of €762 million. Delhaize Group&#x27;s operations are located primarily in the United States (Food Lion LLC, Hannaford Brothers Company) and Belgium. Other operations are located in Greece, Indonesia, Serbia, Luxembourg and Romania.

Delhaize entered the U.S. market through its acquisition of Food Town Stores in 1983, renaming it Food Lion due to name conflict with other stores, and expanding from 22 stores to 226. In 1985, it became a franchisee for Cub Foods and opened the first of many stores in the Atlanta area and in 1996, acquired Kash n&#x27; Karry, a Florida grocery chain. Both its Cub Foods stores, and the Kash n&#x27; Karry chain have since been sold by Delhaize.

In 2007, the company left the Czech market after 16 years and sold all of its 97 supermarkets to Billa. On 19 January 2009 Delhaize announced on request that the branches in Aachen and Cologne should be sold. In 2009, the company left the German market after 6 years and sold all of its 4 supermarkets to REWE Group. In 2011, Delhaize acquired Serbian retailer Delta Maxi.

In May 2013, Harveys was sold along with sister supermarket chains Sweetbay and Reid&#x27;s to BI-LO, LLC for $265 million.

The locations in Montenegro were sold in 2013. The locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina were sold in 2014.

In November 2014, Delhaize Group signed an agreement to sell its Bottom Dollar food store locations in the U.S. to Aldi, Inc. The stores were closed on 12 January 2015, and the transaction was completed early 2015.

On 24 June 2015, Delhaize reached an agreement with Ahold to merge, forming a new parent company, Ahold Delhaize. The merger agreement was signed after approval by shareholders and competition authorities on 23 July 2016. Ahold CEO Dick Boer became CEO of the merged company until his retirement in July 2018, with Frans Muller, CEO of Delhaize initially as deputy CEO and chief integration officer under supervision of Dick Boer. Frans Muller succeeded as CEO in July 2018.

<text>Sir Charles Fellows (31 August 1799 – 8 November 1860) was a British archaeologist and explorer, known for his numerous expeditions in what is present-day Turkey.

==Biography==
Charles Fellows was born at High Pavement, Nottingham on 31 August 1799, the fifth son of John Fellows, a wealthy silk merchant and banker, and his wife Sarah. When fourteen he drew sketches to illustrate a trip to the ruins of Newstead Abbey, which afterwards appeared on the title-page of Moore&#x27;s &quot;Life of Lord Byron&quot;. In 1820 he settled in London, where he became an active member of the British Association. In 1827 he discovered the modern ascent of Mont Blanc. After the death of his mother in 1832 he passed the greater portion of his time in Italy, Greece and the Levant. The numerous sketches he executed were largely used in illustrating &quot;Childe Harold&quot;.

In 1838 he went to Asia Minor, making Smyrna his headquarters. His explorations in the interior and the south led him to districts practically unknown to Europeans, and he thus discovered ruins of a number of ancient cities. He entered Lycia and explored the Xanthus from the mouth at Patara upwards. Nine miles from Patara he discovered the ruins of Xanthus, the ancient capital of Lycia, finely situated on hills, and abounding in magnificent remains. About 15 miles farther up he came upon the ruins of Tlos. After taking sketches of the most interesting objects and copying a number of inscriptions, he returned to Smyrna through Caria and Lydia. The publication in 1839 of &quot;A Journal written during an Excursion in Asia Minor&quot; roused such interest that Lord Palmerston, at the request of the British Museum authorities, asked the British consul at Constantinople to obtain a firman from the sultan to export a number of the Lycian works of art to England.

==Expedition to Lycia==

Having obtained the firman, Fellows, under the auspices of the British Museum, again set out for Lycia in late 1839. He was accompanied by the painter George Scharf, who assisted him by sketching the expedition. This second visit resulted in the discovery of thirteen ancient cities, chief among them Xanthos. He made a further trip in 1841.

Fellows led the archaeological excavation of Xanthos and other Lycian cities in Asia Minor and shipped an enormous amount of antique monuments to England, where they may be seen today in the British Museum. They include reliefs from the Harpy Tomb and the Nereid Monument, amongst many others.

In 1841, he published &quot;An Account of Discoveries in Lycia, being a Journal kept during a Second Excursion in Asia Minor&quot;. Three years later he presented to the British Museum his portfolios, accounts of his expeditions, and specimens of natural history illustrative of Lycia. In 1845, he was knighted as an acknowledgment of his services in the removal of the Xanthian antiquities to Britain. Fellows paid his own expenses in all his journeys and received no financial reward for his endeavors.

==Personal life==

Fellows was married twice, died in London in 1860 and was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.

<text>St James&#x27; Park is a football stadium in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It is the home of Newcastle United. With a seating capacity of 52,305, it is the 8th largest football stadium in England.

St James&#x27; Park has been the home ground of Newcastle United since 1892 and has been used for football since 1880. Throughout its history, the desire for expansion has caused conflict with local residents and the local council. This has led to proposals to move at least twice in the late 1960s, and a controversial 1995 proposed move to nearby Leazes Park. Reluctance to move has led to the distinctive lop-sided appearance of the present-day stadium&#x27;s asymmetrical stands.

Besides club football, St James&#x27; Park has also been used for international football, at the 2012 Olympics, for the rugby league Magic Weekend, rugby union World Cup, Premiership and England Test matches, charity football events, rock concerts, and as a set for film and reality television.

==History==

===Early history===
The site of St James&#x27; Park was originally a patch of sloping grazing land, bordered by Georgian Leazes Terrace, and near the historic Town Moor, owned by the Freemen of the city, both factors that later affected development of the ground, with the local council being the landlord of the site. Leazes Terrace was built c1830 by notable Newcastle residents, architect Thomas Oliver and builder Richard Grainger. Once the residence of high society in Newcastle, it is now a Grade 1 listed building, and, recently refurbished, is currently being used as self-catering postgraduate student accommodation by Newcastle University. The site was also near the gallows of the city, last used in 1844, lending the Gallowgate End its name.

The first football team to play at St James&#x27; Park was Newcastle Rangers in 1880. They moved to a ground at Byker in 1882, then returned briefly to St James&#x27; Park in 1884 before folding that year. Newcastle West End took over the ground in 1886. West End were wound up in 1892 and effectively merged into their rivals Newcastle East End, who took over the lease of St James&#x27; Park and became Newcastle United later that year. On 3 September 1892, Newcastle East End played its first game on the football ground. Local residents opposition to football being played at St James&#x27; dated back to the first games in the Football League following the building of the first small stand at the Gallowgate End. A redeveloped Gallowgate and further stands followed in 1899, bringing the first official capacity to 30,000 (standing).

While the stadium is now synonymous with the &quot;Black and Whites&quot;, Newcastle United actually played in red and white at St James&#x27; Park until 1904. In 1905, a doubling of capacity to 60,000, with a main stand on the Barrack Road (now Milburn Stand), and major other stands, produced a state-of-the-art facility, even boasting a swimming pool.

The second-ever rugby league test match, and first test victory by Great Britain, was played at the ground in 1908 against the touring Australian Kangaroos side on 23 January 1909.

===1920–1990===

Between 1920 and 1930, plans were drawn up for a double-tiered stand by notable football architect Archibald Leitch. However, after planning disputes, all that was achieved was a small roof over the Leazes Terrace side (Sir John Hall Stand). Floodlights were constructed in the 1950s, with the first match played using them held on 25 February 1953 against Celtic.

Up until the 1960s planning difficulties continued, culminating in lack of development of the ground being cited as the reason for failure of Newcastle United to secure the right to host a group stage of the upcoming 1966 World Cup following political disputes.

In the late 1960s further attempts were made to develop the site, and the council proposed a multi-use sports development of St. James&#x27; Park. This was rejected as not financially viable. Plans were drawn up by the club for a move to a stadium in Gosforth, or even a groundshare with Sunderland A.F.C. in a new stadium on Wearside. These plans were withdrawn in 1971 after agreement to redevelop St James&#x27; Park was finally reached, after mediation by the then Minister for Sport, Denis Howell. In 1972, work started on the East Stand, 50 years after it was last permitted to be developed. In 1978 the Leazes End was demolished, but relegation and financial difficulties meant the new stand was not built.
Investigations following the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985 identified a need to replace the ageing West Stand, which was demolished in 1986. Its replacement, the Milburn Stand, was named in honour of Jackie Milburn and opened in 1987. Further development was again shelved for lack of finance.

===Sir John Hall era===
Until the early 1990s the ground had achieved only modest expansion under various owners, with plans dogged by disputes and lack of finance due to poor on-field performances. In January 1992 businessman Sir John Hall, who had led the &quot;Magpie Group&quot; consortium in a hostile takeover of the club, was installed as chairman. Sir John used his experience in property development to rapidly gain approval and invested heavily in the stadium with finances gained from success under new manager Kevin Keegan.

====1993 expansion====
The Leazes End that had been demolished but not replaced was finally rebuilt, and opened as the Sir John Hall stand for Newcastle&#x27;s debut season in the Premiership in 1993. The Gallowgate End was rebuilt, the Milburn Stand modified, and a new pitch, drainage and floodlights were installed. With all four corners filled in with seating, by 1995 the stadium had reached a capacity of 36,610.

====Proposed Leazes Park development====

As the expanded stadium still received full houses due to continuing success of the team led by the returning Kevin Keegan, in 1995, plans were submitted by the club to relocate to Leazes Park to the north. A new £65m purpose-built 55,000-seat stadium would be erected, less than two pitch lengths away from the original, but rotated, which would be similar to the San Siro in Italy. The old ground would be redeveloped to be used by Newcastle Falcons Rugby Club, as part of the wider envisaged &#x27;Sporting Club of Newcastle&#x27;, with basketball and ice-hockey teams purchased by Sir John Hall.

Leazes Park was historically part of the Town Moor, owned by the Freemen of Newcastle, and protected by the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Town Moor Act 1988. The City council initially invited the planning proposal amid suggestions that the club might move to a site in Gateshead, a 75,000-seat stadium next to Gateshead International Stadium, but it led to political debate and opposition. A pressure group &quot;No Business on the Moor&quot; eventually gathered a 36,000-petition signature, equal to the then-current stadium capacity. Opposition also came from a conservation group &quot;Friends of Leazes Park&quot; led by Dolly Potter. The club proposed to mitigate the loss of the moor land with proposals for a land trade-off with landscaping of land freed up by scaling down of the existing stadium restoring the views of the historic park from Leazes Terrace.

It became clear that the relocation plan would not gain planning permission without a potentially long-running public enquiry. To quickly satisfy demand, the club decided to expand the current St James&#x27; Park instead.

===Freddy Shepherd era===
In 1997 Sir John Hall stepped down as chairman (remaining as a director until 2007, now life president of the club), and existing shareholder and board director Freddy Shepherd became chairman.

====1998 expansion====

Following the withdrawal of the Leazes Park plan, the club proposed expansion of St James&#x27; Park to over 52,000 capacity, through major construction of a second tier over the Milburn Stand, Leazes End and adjoining corner, adding to a structure that was itself just four years old. After a refusal by the Secretary of State to take the application to an enquiry, permission was obtained in July 1998. For minimal disruption to seating capacity during construction, the project required 3-day shutdowns of work on home match days. 750 seats were lost during construction. During this expansion, executive boxes in the East Stand were demolished and replaced by seating blocks from pitch level up to the existing rows, in a mirror image of the Milburn Stand. The executive boxes were transferred to the new Milburn/Leazes complex, with more added to the Gallowgate End. During development, the additional stand and roof was constructed while leaving the existing cantilever roof intact until the last possible moment These developments increased capacity to approximately 52,143. The construction was completed in July 2000 at a cost of £42 million. Ironically, after opposition from local residents to the relocation plan, the expansion of the current ground at the Leazes End has further reduced the view of Leazes Park from Leazes Terrace, although this is now student accommodation.

====Save Our Seats campaign====
The 1998 redevelopment caused controversy when the club informed 4,000 season-ticket-holding fans that their seat prices would be increased to corporate rates, with the option of paying these or being moved to seats in the proposed expanded sections. Half of these fans were &#x27;bondholders&#x27;, who had paid £500 in 1994 which they asserted guaranteed them an option on their specific seat for 10 years. Some fans resisted, and after two high-court cases and a Save Our Seats campaign, the club was allowed to move the fans, under an exceptional circumstances clause. As a gesture of goodwill, the club did not pursue the fans for legal costs awarded over their insured limit.

====Casino plans====
In late 2003, preempting the relaxation of the UK gambling laws, the club signed a deal with MGM Mirage to hand over the land above St James Metro station, behind the Gallowgate End, in return for an equity investment, to build a jointly run complex centred on a Super Casino. These plans failed when the proposed number of super casinos was reduced to one in the UK, and in January 2008 £5 million was repaid by the club to MGM.

====Gallowgate additions====
In 2005 the Gallowgate was redeveloped, with a new bar being built beneath the upper tier of the Gallowgate End, named &quot;&quot;Shearer&#x27;s&quot;&#x27;&quot; after Newcastle player Alan Shearer. During excavation underneath the stand during building work, the builders uncovered the original steps of the old Gallowgate End stand, which had simply been covered up when the stadium was fully renovated in 1993. These steps were removed for Shearer&#x27;s Bar. The completion of the redevelopment of the Gallowgate saw the creation of Shearer&#x27;s Bar, an expanded club shop, a club museum and a new box office.

====2007 proposed expansion====

It was announced on 2 April 2007 that the club intend to submit plans for a new £300million development of the stadium and surrounding areas, to include a major conference centre, hotels and luxury apartments. The proposals also include a plan to increase the Gallowgate End, eventually taking the capacity to 60,000.

This expansion would be funded by the city council and linked to the redevelopment of the land behind the stand and over the Metro Station, which had previously been earmarked for the casino project. Expansion of the Gallowgate end involves difficulties due to the proximity of a road, Strawberry Place, and issues surrounding reinforcement of the underground St James Metro station.

===Mike Ashley era===
The 2007 redevelopment plans announced under the previous regime were put on hold following the takeover of the club and its plc holding company by owner Mike Ashley. One of the first noticeable changes in the stadium in the new era was the removal of advertising mounted underneath the roofs (facing the crowd) for Shepherd Offshore and Cameron Hall Developments, companies associated with the previous regime. A large advertising sign for Sports Direct appeared on the lip of the roof of the Gallowgate, visible from the pitch.

A full review of the club performed by the new management team concluded that stadium expansion was not a priority. For the start of the 2008–09 season, the away section was moved from the corner of the Leazes stand/Milburn stand to the other end of the Leazes stand, where it abuts the East stand, at the same upper level. The area of seats designated as the family enclosure were expanded, and certain corporate areas saw increased pricing.

The first home game of the 2008–09 season, at 3 pm on a Saturday, saw the lowest-ever Premier League attendance at the expanded ground, of 47,711, resulting in cash turnstiles. It was speculated at the time that this was due to the Great Recession; however, with the shock departure of Kevin Keegan before the next home game, future changes in attendances would be hard to attribute to this alone. The first game after Keegan&#x27;s resignation, a league fixture against Hull on 13 September 2008, registered a crowd of 50,242 amid protests against Ashley and Dennis Wise. This was followed by an attendance of 44,935 on 27 September in a league fixture against Blackburn Rovers, which followed a record low attendance of 20,577 on Wednesday, 24 September in a League Cup fixture, the lowest ever attendance for a competitive first-team match since the 1993 promotion to the top flight, and a drop of over 4,000 from previous lows.

Although Newcastle&#x27;s crowds inevitably fell in 2009–10 as a result of their relegation and the fact that Britain was still in recession, the Magpies still attracted a modern-day record average attendance for a club at this level with their attendance for the season averaging at 43,383. They also became the first championship club to attract a league attendance of more than 50,000 at this level in the modern era, and ended the season promoted as champions of the Football League Championship.

In October 2014, a scoreboard was installed in the far corner of the Sir John Hall Stand. The scoreboard was used for the first time on 18 October during a Premier League tie against Leicester City. However the game was delayed one hour, due to damage caused by strong wind to the paneling surrounding the scoreboard. Newcastle United later stated on their website: &quot;Supporter safety was of paramount importance.&quot;

====Renaming of the stadium====
On 10 November 2011, Newcastle United announced that the stadium would officially be renamed Sports Direct Arena, as a temporary measure to &quot;showcase the sponsorship opportunity to interested parties&quot;, whilst looking for a sponsor for possible future stadium re-branding. According to the club, the St James&#x27; Park title was dropped as not being &quot;commercially attractive&quot;.

Previously, in 2009, the club had announced plans to sell the naming rights for the stadium. After protests about the possible loss of the name of the stadium, which included the tabling of an early day motion in Parliament, the club clarified the following week that the move would not involve the loss of the name St James&#x27; Park altogether, citing the example of &#x27;SportsDirect.com@StJamesPark&#x27; as a potential stadium rights package. The following day, the club announced that the stadium would be known as &quot;sportsdirect.com @ St James&#x27; Park Stadium&quot; temporarily until the end of the season, to showcase the idea behind the package, until the new sponsor was announced. The stadium&#x27;s official renaming as the Sports Direct Arena, or SDA, caused considerable perturbation amongst supporters of the team.

On 9 October 2012, payday loan company Wonga.com became Newcastle United&#x27;s main commercial sponsor and purchased the stadium naming rights. They subsequently announced that the St James&#x27; Park name would be restored as part of the deal.

===Saudi-led era===
Following the takeover of Newcastle United, the new ownership would remove the Sports Direct sponsorship all over the stadium with co owner Amanda Staveley claiming she was &quot;looking forward&quot; to removing the Sports Direct branding to get new sponsors with the signs being removed on 6 December. With the removal of the sponsor in the stadium former owner Mike Ashley would take legal action against Staveley and her husband Mehrdad Ghodoussi after Ashley alleged that both Staveley and Ghodoussi breached their agreement to continue to sponsor the stadium until the end of the 2021–22 season.

Prior to the beginning of the 2024-25 season, the &quot;Newcastle United&quot; signage, located above the East Stand, was restored to the original font that was used prior to the Sports Direct sponsorship.

==Stadium description==

===Name===

====Official names====

St James&#x27; Park is spelt with &quot;James&#x27;&quot; featuring one &quot;s&quot; and an apostrophe mark, as seen on the signage of the St James&#x27; Park steps outside the entrance to the stadium, and signage inside the adjacent Metro station. The use of an apostrophe is in contrast with the name of the Metro station itself, which is signed as &quot;St James&quot; Metro station, and with the street signs of the nearby &quot;St James&quot; Street and &quot;St James&quot; Terrace. Further, the use of one &quot;s&quot; and an apostrophe mark differs from the common convention of adding a second &quot;s&quot; to monosyllabic possessives ending in s, as is the case with the well-known public space in London: St James&#x27;s Park.

The full stop after the &quot;St&quot; giving St. James&#x27; Park is both included and omitted by many sources, including the club&#x27;s official website address information.

Post-millennium it has been debated both whether the written name should include an apostrophe mark after St James, and, if it does, whether the official written form should include an extra &#x27;s&#x27; after the apostrophe. Pronunciation of the name with a second &#x27;s&#x27; sound or not differs between both the local public and journalists, and is similarly debated.

In May 2008 BBC Look North examined the case for adding an extra &#x27;s&#x27;, to denote the ground is &quot;the park of St James&quot;. The club stated that the ground is named after its neighbouring street, St James Street, which predates the ground, although it was pointed out the road sign of that street, and that of the adjacent St James Terrace, did not feature apostrophes. The BBC stated that both local newspapers &quot;The Evening Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot; write the name with a second &#x27;s&#x27;, reinstating it partially in response to reader complaints after a period of publishing stories without it.
The club insisted the name is pronounced without a second &#x27;s&#x27;, whilst it was asserted by the BBC that older fans, in particular, pronounce it with two.

A professor of applied linguistics of Newcastle University stated that if a second &#x27;s&#x27; was added to the name, it has to ultimately be pronounced in speech. The BBC went on to state that according to the Apostrophe Protection Society, if the ground is named as the &quot;Park of St James&quot;, the name of the ground is correctly written as St. James&#x27;s Park, with the second &#x27;s&#x27; pronounced.

Commenting on the written form on Radio Newcastle a week after the BBC story, a different senior lecturer in applied linguistics also of Newcastle University stated that if the name is to denote &quot;the park of St James&quot;, the written form should feature an apostrophe, but the use of an additional &#x27;s&#x27; after it is optional and both are correct.

Match-day programmes printed up until the late 1940s have written the name as &quot;St. James&#x27;s Park&quot;. According to the club historian, the oldest memorabilia in the club museum refers to the ground as being pronounced without a second &#x27;s&#x27;. However, a match-day programme dating from 1896, reprinted in the match-day programme of a home match against Derby County (23 December 2007) depicts the stadium name as St. James&#x27;s Park.

Other sources also support the idea that the name should have no apostrophe as found in the name of the adjacent St James Street

====Nicknames====
The stadium is known by its initials, SJP, or as St James&#x27;. In reflection of the early use of the site, it is also often referred to as Gallowgate, distinct from similarly unofficially named Gallowgate End, the name of the south stand.

===Orientation===
The stadium has a rough pitch alignment of north easterly. The four main stands are as follows:

* Gallowgate End (previously known as the Newcastle Brown Ale Stand and before that the Exhibition Stand), at the southern end of the ground, named unofficially for its proximity to the old City gallows, and officially after the long association with the club of sponsor Scottish and Newcastle Breweries;
* Leazes End (previously the Sir John Hall Stand), at the northern end of the ground, named for its proximity to Leazes Park, and after the club&#x27;s Life President Sir John Hall; The Singing Section was positioned in Level 7 of this stand.
* Milburn Stand, the main stand, on the west side of the ground. Named after 1950s footballer Jackie Milburn
* East Stand, whose name is self-explanatory, and the smallest stand of the four. Following the death of Sir Bobby Robson, a plan to rename the East Stand the Sir Bobby Robson Stand (or the Robson Stand) was drawn up. As yet, this has not been made official.

The unofficial new home of the singing section is located in the &quot;Strawberry Corner&quot; (South East Corner, located next to the Strawberry Pub) - between the Gallowgate End &amp; East Stand.

===Location===
The stadium&#x27;s location is close to the city centre, 500 m roughly north of Central station, the main railway station of the city. The stadium is bordered by Strawberry Place behind the Gallowgate, Barrack Road in front of the main entrance, a car park to the north and Leazes Terrace to the East. Further south is St James station, a terminus station of the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro line to the east, although the main Metro interchange at Monument station, is situated only 250 m to the east.

===Architecture===
The Milburn stand is the &#x27;main&#x27; stand of the stadium, housing the main entrance, lifts and escalators behind a glass fronted atrium. The dugouts and player&#x27;s tunnel is located in the traditional position of the middle of the main stand. Behind the seating terraces of the stands, the Milburn/Leazes structure contains four concourse levels, the Gallowgate End has three concourse levels, and the East stand has two concourse levels.
The stadium has an asymmetrical appearance from the air and from some angles from ground level, due to the discrepancy in height between the sides and ends of the ground. The height difference between the Leazes/Milburn complex and the East/Gallowgate stands allows views of the city centre from many seating positions inside the ground. Further expansion of the Gallowgate End could potentially produce a more balanced horseshoe arrangement of equal height stands, similar to that of Celtic Park.

The Milburn stand and Leazes end are double tiered, separated by a level of executive boxes; The East Stand and Gallowgate End are single tiered, with boxes also at the top of the Gallowgate. The three newest sides, the Milburn Stand, Leazes End and Gallowgate End are of structural steel frame and pre-cast concrete construction. In common with many new or expanded British football stadiums, the traditional box shaped &#x27;stands&#x27; were augmented in the 1993 expansion by filling in the corners to maximise available seating, up to a uniform height. The Milburn Stand and Leazes End now rise higher than this level, covered by a one piece cantilevered glass roof. A further smaller stand section rises above this level behind the Gallowgate End.

The 1998 built steel truss cantilever roof above the Milburn/Leazes complex is the largest cantilever structure in Europe at , eclipsing the cantilevers of Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford.

===Seating layout===
The current stadium design offers an unobstructed view of the pitch from all areas of the ground. The Milburn stand is the location of the directors box and press boxes, and the main TV camera point for televised games.

Away fans for league matches were originally accommodated in the upper level, in the north west corner, which can hold a maximum of 3,000 fans. However, plans were made at the end of the 2007–2008 season to relocate the away supporters to the far end of the upper level of the Leazes End. This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being so far from the pitch due to the height of the stand, and the 14 flights of stairs to reach the upper level. For FA Cup matches the lower section of the corner is also used.

The traditional home of the more vocal fans is considered the Gallowgate End, in the same vein as The Kop for Liverpool F.C. The Gallowgate End was the end that the team attacked in the second half if they win the coin toss. In recent years there has been unofficial fan movement to create a singing section in the Leazes End upper tier, partly to counter the away fans, and partly to recreate some atmosphere lost since the recent expansion over 36,000. This group of fans call themselves the &#x27;Toon Ultras&#x27;. Level 7 of the Milburn Stand houses the official Family Enclosure. Due to the expansion of the Family Enclosure, many fans from the singing section have relocated to the Strawberry Corner.

In 2013 a group began to help &#x27;Bring Back The Noise&#x27; as St.James Park, this being branded as &#x27;Division &#x27;92&#x27;. This group first began at home to Metalist Kharkiv in the Europa League. From that date the group began to move from strength to strength with new aims set to develop a singing section within the ground for all league games.

===Facilities===
As well as the normal Premiership football stadium facilities, the stadium contains conference and banqueting facilities. These comprise a total of 6 suites with a total capacity of 2,050, including the 1,000 capacity &quot;Bamburgh Suite&quot; containing a stage, dance floor and 3 bars, and the &quot;New Magpie Room&quot;, on two levels with a pitch view.

The stadium houses premium priced seating areas designated into clubs, each with their own access to a bar and lounge behind the stand for use before the match and at half-time. The &quot;Platinum Club&quot;, &quot;Bar 1892&quot;, &quot;Sovereign Club&quot; and the &quot;Black &amp; White Club&quot; are in the Milburn Stand, and the &quot;Sports Bar&quot; is in the Leazes End

The Gallowgate End houses &quot;Shearer&#x27;s&quot;, a sports bar and lounge, which is effectively another city centre nightspot in Newcastle, accessible only from the exterior of the ground. The bar is named after Alan Shearer. The Gallowgate also houses a large club shop, a police station. The Milburn stand houses the main box-office. In the south west corner there is also a cafe and a club museum.

====Statues and memorials====

===Capacity===
The stadium has a maximum seating capacity of 52,350, making it:

* the eighth-largest club football stadium in England, behind Wembley Stadium, Old Trafford, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Emirates Stadium, Etihad Stadium, Anfield and London Stadium;
* the tenth-largest football stadium in the United Kingdom overall when including the Millennium Stadium (the national stadium of Wales), and Celtic Park (a Scottish club football ground);
* the twelfth largest stadium in the United Kingdom overall when including the rugby venues of Twickenham in England, Murrayfield in Scotland.

Developments since 1993 have ensured the lower tier of seating of the ground still forms a continuous bowl around the pitch, below the level of the executive boxes. The club record attendance is 68,386 set in 1930 against Chelsea, when standing was allowed on the terraces.

==Usage==

===Club football===
Newcastle United have played their home league matches continuously at St James&#x27; Park. The stadium had not featured a scoreboard or big screen of any kind since the 1993 expansion displaced one from The Gallowgate end, although in 2007 bright red digital time displays were installed near the corner flags at pitch level. A big screen for the stadium was mooted as a possibility as part of a proposed new stadium branding exercise for 2010. On 18 October 2014 a large scoreboard was erected onto the side of the Leazes End, adjacent to the Milburn Stand. The first day of its use in a game versus Leicester City saw a one-hour delay to kick-off over safety concerns around the screen due to high winds.

===International football===

The stadium hosted three matches during Euro 1996. Along with Elland Road it was assigned to Group B, which comprised France, Spain, Romania and Bulgaria.

The stadium was one of several venues used as temporary home grounds for the England team while the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium took place.

St James&#x27; Park also hosted some football matches in the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The stadium hosted two international friendlies in September 2023 between Saudi Arabia and Costa Rica on the 8th, and Saudi Arabia and South Korea on the 12th. 

England Women played against France in 2024, the first time The Lionesses have played at St James park 

The stadium will host matches in UEFA Euro 2028.

====Matches====
===Pitch===
For football use, the pitch has the maximum international dimensions of 105 by 68 metres.

===Rugby league===
On 30 and 31 May 2015, the stadium held the Super League Magic Weekend. St James&#x27; Park was chosen to host the event after the City of Manchester Stadium, which had hosted the event annually since 2012, became unavailable.

The event was considered a success, with the 2015 event setting both single-day and aggregate attendance records for the event. The Magic Weekend returned to St James&#x27; Park in 2016, breaking the aggregate crowd record in the process, and returned once again for 2017 and 2018.

Magic Weekend returned to Newcastle in April 2021, for the 2021 Season, after previously been held at Anfield for the 2019 Season and being cancelled for the 2020 season. Magic continued to be played at Newcastle in 2022 and 2023, before being moved to Elland Road, home of Leeds United, for the 2024 season, where it was renamed to &quot;MAGIC WKND&quot;.

There have been three rugby league internationals played at St James&#x27; Park. The stadium is hosted the opening ceremony and opening game of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup – Men’s tournament, the first rugby league international to be played at the stadium for 110 years.

===Rugby union===

====England national team====

On Friday 6 September 2019, England defeated Italy in a warm-up match for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. This was England&#x27;s first Test match in Newcastle and first away from Twickenham (outside the World Cup) since 2009.

====2015 Rugby World Cup====

The stadium hosted three 2015 Rugby World Cup matches. The first was a Pool B match between South Africa and Scotland on 3 October 2015, with South Africa winning 34 - 16 with 50,900 in attendance. The second was a Pool C match between New Zealand and Tonga on 9 October 2015, with New Zealand winning 47 - 9 with 50,985 in attendance. The third and final was a Pool B match Samoa and Scotland the next day with Scotland winning a close one 36 - 33 with 51,982 in attendance.

====European professional club rugby====

In April 2017 the stadium was announced as the host for the 2019 finals of the European Rugby Challenge Cup and Champions Cup.

====Newcastle Falcons====

On 21 November 2017 it was announced that Newcastle Falcons would take their Premiership Rugby match against Northampton Saints on 24 March 2018 to St James&#x27; Park. The match dubbed The Big One was the first Premiership game at the venue.

The Falcons would return the following year to host Sale Sharks on 23 March 2019.

===Charity matches===
As well as professional matches, the stadium has been the venue for several charity football matches, including testimonial matches for Alan Shearer and Peter Beardsley. The stadium was also the venue of the final of The Prince&#x27;s Trust &quot;Challenge Trophy&quot;, on 14 October 2007, between the Duke of Northumberland and Earl of Durham teams.

On 26 July 2009 St James&#x27; Park hosted the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match, in aid of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, in which the famous Italia &#x27;90 World Cup semi-final loss against West Germany, in which Robson&#x27;s England team were beaten 4–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw, would be replayed featuring players from the original World Cup squads and other special guests.

===Video games===
The stadium has regularly featured on the popular football game series FIFA (video game series) and appears to be included on the global front cover of FIFA 13 with Lionel Messi in the foreground. The title sequence of FIFA Football 2004 featuring Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero was shot at the stadium.

===Concerts===
The stadium has hosted concerts for many famous artists, including The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen &amp; E Street Band, Queen, Bob Dylan, Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Kings of Leon and Ed Sheeran. In 2023 the stadium hosted two sold out nights for Sam Fender.

===Film and television===
The stadium has also been used as an audition venue for the television show &quot;The X Factor&quot; and also reality television show &quot;Big Brother&quot;. St James&#x27; Park has also hosted the final celebrity matches of the Sky television reality TV show &quot;The Match&quot;. The stadium was used extensively as a filming location for the film &quot;Goal!&quot;, as the film follows a fictional player Santiago Muñez who signs for Newcastle. There is also film footage showing a game between Newcastle and Liverpool FC from 1901.

===Sir Bobby Robson tributes===
Sir Bobby Robson, a lifetime Newcastle fan who managed the club from 1999 to 2004, died of cancer aged 76 on 31 July 2009, five days after having been at St James&#x27; Park to watch the England v Germany charity trophy match played in his honour and in aid of his cancer foundation. Immediately after his death, St James&#x27; Park became an impromptu shrine to Sir Bobby, with thousands of fans leaving floral tributes, club shirts and scarves in the Leazes End for the following ten days. After a private funeral service on 5 August, a thanksgiving service held on 21 September at Durham Cathedral in Sir Bobby&#x27;s memory was broadcast on two big screens for spectators in the Leazes End.

<doc id="648383" wikidata="Q2104904" url="?curid=648383" title="Microsoft Entourage">
<text>Microsoft Entourage is a discontinued e-mail client and personal information manager that was developed by Microsoft for Mac OS 8.5 and later. Microsoft first released Entourage in October 2000 as part of the Microsoft Office 2001 office suite; Office 98, the previous version of Microsoft Office for the classic Mac OS included Outlook Express 5. The last version was Entourage: Mac 2008, part of Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, released on January 15, 2008. Entourage was replaced by Outlook for Macintosh in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, released on October 26, 2010.

==Overview==
Entourage provided email, calendar, address book, task list, note list, and project manager functionality. With Entourage 2004, Microsoft began offering a Project Center, which allowed the user to create and organize projects. Information may come from within Entourage or outside the program. Entourage supported retrieving email using POP, IMAP, and (for Microsoft Exchange servers) WebDAV.

Entourage 2008 featured a new &quot;My Day&quot; utility, which assists in organizing one&#x27;s day, and cites (in the welcome message) improvements to search speed, &quot;to do&quot; flags, improved junk mail and phishing protection, as well as quick navigation via favorites and customizable toolbars.

==Features==
Entourage supported some Mac OS technologies, like the Spotlight search engine and AppleScript; however, the use of a monolithic database made it difficult to back up incrementally with Time Machine. Entourage also maintained a separate address book, but allowed synchronization of contacts and calendar events through Sync Services.

===Comparison to Outlook===

Unlike the other applications in the Mac version of the Microsoft Office suite, Entourage did not share a name with its Microsoft Windows counterpart. Microsoft claimed that Entourage was intended &quot;to address an entirely different audience&quot;. Entourage had its origins in Outlook Express 5 on the Mac, as well as Claris Emailer and contained &quot;no ported code, and no Office code&quot;. Nevertheless, Microsoft has positioned Entourage as a &quot;similar&quot; product for Macintosh customers on Exchange servers.

===As a client for Microsoft Exchange===
Entourage had included support for Microsoft Exchange servers since August 4, 2003, when the Exchange Update for Entourage X was released. This early release required the use of IMAP for mail connectivity and WebDAV for address and calendar functionality. (Subsequent versions have dropped the requirement for IMAP and rely solely on WebDAV.) Users complained of the lack of a variety of functions present in Outlook for Windows and Outlook 2001.

Subsequent versions of Entourage added some of the missing functionality. However, full parity with Outlook as an Exchange client was never available in Entourage 2008. Synchronization of tasks and notes with an Exchange server was not available. Many Exchange users have been vocal in denouncing Microsoft&#x27;s omission of these features. Microsoft claimed to have prioritized &quot;reliability&quot; over expanded Exchange support in Entourage 2008.

One major shortcoming of Entourage was its inability to handle complex HTML. While messages could be received and viewed correctly, they could not be forwarded without all formatting being stripped out. As an example, an airline confirmation received from, say, Imaginary Airlines, could not be forwarded without all of the pictorial information being reduced to links, rendering the e-mail unreadable. A workaround for this was to choose &quot;Forward as attachment&quot; which forwarded the message as a message/rfc822 file, and preserved complex HTML formatting.

An additional limitation was the inability to attach what is referred to as an &quot;Item&quot; in Outlook to a message while it was being composed since there was no menu choice to allow this. Instead, a user needed to find the item to be forwarded, i.e., a Contact, select it, then choose Forward as vCard from the menu.

It was also not possible to create or manage server side rules on the Exchange server, so filtering only worked when the Entourage application was running.

===Limitations===

Entourage could not natively read Outlook Personal Folder files and could not read Outlook archived emails without first re-importing them back into the main Windows Outlook database. As a result, it was impossible to directly transfer email data from Outlook (Windows) into Entourage (Mac).

Although Microsoft had released a PST Import Tool for Entourage, this did not directly solve the problem of exporting data from Windows to Mac, because this utility could only import PST files from Outlook 2001 for the Mac.

One could import a Windows Outlook 2000 compatible PST to Mac Outlook 2001, and then use the utility to import into Entourage. To address this, Microsoft made Mac Outlook 2001 available for free download.

This wasn&#x27;t a solution for all Mac users, because Outlook 2001 only runs in the Classic Environment, which cannot run in OS 10.5 or on any Intel Macs. Outlook for Office 2011 for Intel Macs, is able to import Outlook .pst files from Windows; however, data will be stored as many individual files, rather than in a single database such as .pst or the Entourage database.

Macworld indicates that Windows Outlook messages can be transferred to Apple Mail or Entourage by using Mozilla Thunderbird as an intermediate agent. Thunderbird on Windows is used to import the mail from Outlook. Then the converted mail file is moved from the Windows Thunderbird directory to the Mac and the import feature is used on Mac Mail or Entourage.
However, message attachments will be lost in the conversion to Thunderbird.

Commercial third-party software (e.g. Emailchemy) is available to facilitate the transfer of Outlook data to Entourage. But those using the mbox format will not be able to respect any subfolder hierarchy since the mbox format doesn&#x27;t support it.

Other alternative solutions include synchronizing: to an iPod Touch or iPhone through iTunes; using Apple MobileMe service; using an IMAP-enabled email provider; using a Microsoft Exchange server.

<doc id="648384" wikidata="Q1428053" url="?curid=648384" title="PictBridge">
<text>PictBridge is a historical computing industry standard introduced in 2003 from the Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association (CIPA) for direct printing. It allows images to be printed directly from digital cameras to a printer, without having to connect the formal name is &quot;Standard of Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association CIPA DC-001 — 2003 Digital Solutions for Imaging Devices&quot;. CIPA DC-001-2003 Rev. 2.0 has been published in 2007.

== Implementation ==

PictBridge is typically implemented using USB ports and the USB protocol. PictBridge-capable printers typically have a USB type A port which is connected by cable to the USB port of a PictBridge-capable digital camera (typically a Mini-B). The user selects the images on the camera to print.

== Licensing ==
The PictBridge specification is not an open standard; it can only be obtained from CIPA after agreement not to disclose any information from the specification to others. In practice, this means that PictBridge cannot be implemented as free and open source software, other than by reverse-engineering the protocol, if publishing source code of an implementation of the PictBridge standard is considered to count as &quot;disclosing information&quot; from the specification.

A printer may implement functions similar to a PictBridge printer without the non-disclosure agreement merely by treating the camera&#x27;s memory as a USB mass storage device, although the user interface for image selection would necessarily be on the printer rather than the camera in this case.
