<text>Logical reasoning is a mental activity that aims to arrive at a conclusion in a rigorous way. It happens in the form of inferences or arguments by starting from a set of premises and reasoning to a conclusion supported by these premises. The premises and the conclusion are propositions, i.e. true or false claims about what is the case. Together, they form an argument. Logical reasoning is norm-governed in the sense that it aims to formulate correct arguments that any rational person would find convincing. The main discipline studying logical reasoning is logic. 

Distinct types of logical reasoning differ from each other concerning the norms they employ and the certainty of the conclusion they arrive at. Deductive reasoning offers the strongest support: the premises ensure the conclusion, meaning that it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if all the premises are true. Such an argument is called a valid argument, for example: all men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is mortal. For valid arguments, it is not important whether the premises are actually true but only that, if they were true, the conclusion could not be false. Valid arguments follow a rule of inference, such as &quot;modus ponens&quot; or &quot;modus tollens&quot;. Deductive reasoning plays a central role in formal logic and mathematics.

For non-deductive logical reasoning, the premises make their conclusion rationally convincing without ensuring its truth. This is often understood in terms of probability: the premises make it more likely that the conclusion is true and strong inferences make it very likely. Some uncertainty remains because the conclusion introduces new information not already found in the premises. Non-deductive reasoning plays a central role in everyday life and in most sciences. Often-discussed types are inductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a form of generalization that infers a universal law from a pattern found in many individual cases. It can be used to conclude that &quot;all ravens are black&quot; based on many individual observations of black ravens. Abductive reasoning, also known as &quot;inference to the best explanation&quot;, starts from an observation and reasons to the fact explaining this observation. An example is a doctor who examines the symptoms of their patient to make a diagnosis of the underlying cause. Analogical reasoning compares two similar systems. It observes that one of them has a feature and concludes that the other one also has this feature.

Arguments that fall short of the standards of logical reasoning are called fallacies. For formal fallacies, like affirming the consequent, the error lies in the logical form of the argument. For informal fallacies, like false dilemmas, the source of the faulty reasoning is usually found in the content or the context of the argument. Some theorists understand logical reasoning in a wide sense that is roughly equivalent to critical thinking. In this regard, it encompasses cognitive skills besides the ability to draw conclusions from premises. Examples are skills to generate and evaluate reasons and to assess the reliability of information. Further factors are to seek new information, to avoid inconsistencies, and to consider the advantages and disadvantages of different courses of action before making a decision.

== Definition ==
Logical reasoning is a form of thinking that is concerned with arriving at a conclusion in a rigorous way. This happens in the form of inferences by transforming the information present in a set of premises to reach a conclusion. It can be defined as &quot;selecting and interpreting information from a given context, making connections, and verifying and drawing conclusions based on provided and interpreted information and the associated rules and processes.&quot; Logical reasoning is rigorous in the sense that it does not generate any conclusion but ensures that the premises support the conclusion and act as reasons for believing it. One central aspect is that this support is not restricted to a specific reasoner but that any rational person would find the conclusion convincing based on the premises. This way, logical reasoning plays a role in expanding knowledge.

The main discipline studying logical reasoning is called logic. It is divided into formal and informal logic, which study formal and informal logical reasoning. Traditionally, logical reasoning was primarily associated with deductive reasoning studied by formal logic. But in a wider sense, it also includes forms of non-deductive reasoning, such as inductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning.

The forms of logical reasoning have in common that they use premises to make inferences in a norm-governed way. As norm-governed practices, they aim at inter-subjective agreement about the application of the norms, i.e. agreement about whether and to what degree the premises support their conclusion. The types of logical reasoning differ concerning the exact norms they use as well as the certainty of the conclusion they arrive at. Deductive reasoning offers the strongest support and implies its conclusion with certainty, like mathematical proofs. For non-deductive reasoning, the premises make the conclusion more likely but do not ensure it. This support comes in degrees: strong arguments make the conclusion very likely, as is the case for well-researched issues in the empirical sciences. Some theorists give a very wide definition of logical reasoning that includes its role as a cognitive skill responsible for high-quality thinking. In this regard, it has roughly the same meaning as critical thinking.

== Basic concepts ==
A variety of basic concepts is used in the study and analysis of logical reasoning. Logical reasoning happens by inferring a conclusion from a set of premises. Premises and conclusions are normally seen as propositions. A proposition is a statement that makes a claim about what is the case. In this regard, propositions act as truth-bearers: they are either true or false. For example, the sentence &quot;The water is boiling.&quot; expresses a proposition since it can be true or false. The sentences &quot;Is the water boiling?&quot; or &quot;Boil the water!&quot;, on the other hand, express no propositions since they are neither true nor false. The propositions used as the starting point of logical reasoning are called the premises. The proposition inferred from them is called the conclusion. For example, in the argument &quot;all puppies are dogs; all dogs are animals; therefore all puppies are animals&quot;, the propositions &quot;all puppies are dogs&quot; and &quot;all dogs are animals&quot; act as premises while the proposition &quot;all puppies are animals&quot; is the conclusion.

A set of premises together with a conclusion is called an argument. An inference is the mental process of reasoning that starts from the premises and arrives at the conclusion. But the terms &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;inference&quot; are often used interchangeably in logic. The purpose of arguments is to convince a person that something is the case by providing reasons for this belief. Many arguments in natural language do not explicitly state all the premises. Instead, the premises are often implicitly assumed, especially if they seem obvious and belong to common sense. Some theorists distinguish between simple and complex arguments. A complex argument is made up of many sub-arguments. This way, a chain is formed in which the conclusions of earlier arguments act as premises for later arguments. Each link in this chain has to be successful for a complex argument to succeed.

An argument is correct or incorrect depending on whether the premises offer support for the conclusion. This is often understood in terms of probability: if the premises of a correct argument are true, it raises the probability that its conclusion is also true. Forms of logical reasoning can be distinguished based on how the premises support the conclusion. Deductive arguments offer the strongest possible support. Non-deductive arguments are weaker but are nonetheless correct forms of reasoning. The term &quot;proof&quot; is often used for deductive arguments or very strong non-deductive arguments. Incorrect arguments offer no or not sufficient support and are called fallacies, although the use of incorrect arguments does not mean their conclusions are incorrect.

== Deductive reasoning ==

Deductive reasoning is the mental process of drawing deductive inferences. Deductively valid inferences are the most reliable form of inference: it is impossible for their conclusion to be false if all the premises are true. This means that the truth of the premises ensures the truth of the conclusion. A deductive argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true. For example, inferring the conclusion &quot;no cats are frogs&quot; from the premises &quot;all frogs are amphibians&quot; and &quot;no cats are amphibians&quot; is a sound argument. But even arguments with false premises can be deductively valid, like inferring that &quot;no cats are frogs&quot; from the premises &quot;all frogs are mammals&quot; and &quot;no cats are mammals&quot;. In this regard, it only matters that the conclusion could not be false if the premises are true and not whether they actually are true.

Deductively valid arguments follow a rule of inference. A rule of inference is a scheme of drawing conclusions that depends only on the logical form of the premises and the conclusion but not on their specific content. The most-discussed rule of inference is the modus ponens. It has the following form: &quot;p&quot;; if &quot;p&quot; then &quot;q&quot;; therefore &quot;q&quot;. This scheme is deductively valid no matter what &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; stand for. For example, the argument &quot;today is Sunday; if today is Sunday then I don&#x27;t have to go to work today; therefore I don&#x27;t have to go to work today&quot; is deductively valid because it has the form of &quot;modus ponens&quot;. Other popular rules of inference include &quot;modus tollens&quot; (not &quot;q&quot;; if &quot;p&quot; then &quot;q&quot;; therefore not &quot;p&quot;) and the disjunctive syllogism (&quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot;; not &quot;p&quot;; therefore &quot;q&quot;).

The rules governing deductive reasoning are often expressed formally as logical systems for assessing the correctness of deductive arguments. Aristotelian logic is one of the earliest systems and was treated as the canon of logic in the Western world for over two thousand years. It is based on syllogisms, like concluding that &quot;Socrates is a mortal&quot; from the premises &quot;Socrates is a man&quot; and &quot;all men are mortal&quot;. The currently dominant system is known as classical logic and covers many additional forms of inferences besides syllogisms. So-called extended logics are based on classical logic and introduce additional rules of inference for specific domains. For example, modal logic can be used to reason about what is possible and what is necessary. Temporal logic can be used to draw inferences about what happened before, during, and after an event. Classical logic and its extensions rest on a set of basic logical intuitions accepted by most logicians. They include the law of excluded middle, the double negation elimination, the principle of explosion, and the bivalence of truth. So-called deviant logics reject some of these basic intuitions and propose alternative rules governing the validity of arguments. For example, intuitionistic logics reject the law of excluded middle and the double negation elimination while paraconsistent logics reject the principle of explosion.

Deductive reasoning plays a central role in formal logic and mathematics. In mathematics, it is used to prove mathematical theorems based on a set of premises, usually called axioms. For example, Peano arithmetic is based on a small set of axioms from which all essential properties of natural numbers can be inferred using deductive reasoning.

== Non-deductive reasoning ==
Non-deductive reasoning is an important form of logical reasoning besides deductive reasoning. It happens in the form of inferences drawn from premises to reach and support a conclusion, just like its deductive counterpart. The hallmark of non-deductive reasoning is that this support is fallible. This means that if the premises are true, it makes it more likely but not certain that the conclusion is also true. So for a non-deductive argument, it is possible for all its premises to be true while its conclusion is still false. There are various types of non-deductive reasoning, like inductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning. Non-deductive reasoning is more common in everyday life than deductive reasoning.

Non-deductive reasoning is ampliative and defeasible. Sometimes, the terms &quot;non-deductive reasoning&quot;, &quot;ampliative reasoning&quot;, and &quot;defeasible reasoning&quot; are used synonymously even though there are slight differences in their meaning. Non-deductive reasoning is ampliative in the sense that it arrives at information not already present in the premises. Deductive reasoning, by contrast, is non-ampliative since it only extracts information already present in the premises without adding any additional information. So with non-deductive reasoning, one can learn something new that one did not know before. But the fact that new information is added means that this additional information may be false. This is why non-deductive reasoning is not as secure as deductive reasoning.

A closely related aspect is that non-deductive reasoning is defeasible or non-monotonic. This means that one may have to withdraw a conclusion upon learning new information. For example, if all birds a person has seen so far can fly, this person is justified in reaching the inductive conclusion that all birds fly. This conclusion is defeasible because the reasoner may have to revise it upon learning that penguins are birds that do not fly.

=== Inductive ===

Inductive reasoning starts from a set of individual instances and uses generalization to arrive at a universal law governing all cases. Some theorists use the term in a very wide sense to include any form of non-deductive reasoning, even if no generalization is involved. In the more narrow sense, it can be defined as &quot;the process of inferring a general law or principle from the observations of particular instances.&quot; For example, starting from the empirical observation that &quot;all ravens I have seen so far are black&quot;, inductive reasoning can be used to infer that &quot;all ravens are black&quot;. In a slightly weaker form, induction can also be used to infer an individual conclusion about a single case, for example, that &quot;the next raven I will see is black&quot;. Inductive reasoning is closely related to statistical reasoning and probabilistic reasoning. Like other forms of non-deductive reasoning, induction is not certain. This means that the premises support the conclusion by making it more probable but do not ensure its truth. In this regard, the conclusion of an inductive inference contains new information not already found in the premises.

Various aspects of the premises are important to ensure that they offer significant support to the conclusion. In this regard, the sample size should be large to guarantee that many individual cases were considered before drawing the conclusion. An intimately connected factor is that the sample is random and representative. This means that it includes a fair and balanced selection of individuals with different key characteristics. For example, when making a generalization about human beings, the sample should include members of different races, genders, and age groups. A lot of reasoning in everyday life is inductive. For example, when predicting how a person will react to a situation, inductive reasoning can be employed based on how the person reacted previously in similar circumstances. It plays an equally central role in the sciences, which often start with many particular observations and then apply the process of generalization to arrive at a universal law.

A well-known issue in the field of inductive reasoning is the so-called problem of induction. It concerns the question of whether or why anyone is justified in believing the conclusions of inductive inferences. This problem was initially raised by David Hume, who holds that future events need not resemble past observations. In this regard, inductive reasoning about future events seems to rest on the assumption that nature remains uniform.

=== Abductive ===

Abductive reasoning is usually understood as an inference from an observation to a fact explaining this observation. Inferring that it has rained after seeing that the streets are wet is one example. Often, the expression &quot;inference to the best explanation&quot; is used as a synonym. This expression underlines that there are usually many possible explanations of the same fact and that the reasoner should only infer the best explanation. For example, a tsunami could also explain why the streets are wet but this is usually not the best explanation. As a form of non-deductive reasoning, abduction does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion even if the premises are true.

The more plausible the explanation is, the stronger it is supported by the premises. In this regard, it matters that the explanation is simple, i.e. does not include any unnecessary claims, and that it is consistent with established knowledge. Other central criteria for a good explanation are that it fits observed and commonly known facts and that it is relevant, precise, and not circular. Ideally, the explanation should be verifiable by empirical evidence. If the explanation involves extraordinary claims then it requires very strong evidence.
Abductive reasoning plays a central role in science when researchers discover unexplained phenomena. In this case, they often resort to a form of guessing to come up with general principles that could explain the observations. The hypotheses are then tested and compared to discover which one provides the best explanation. This pertains particularly to cases of causal reasoning that try to discover the relation between causes and effects. Abduction is also very common in everyday life. It is used there in a similar but less systematic form. This relates, for example, to the trust people put in what other people say. The best explanation of why a person asserts a claim is usually that they believe it and have evidence for it. This form of abductive reasoning is relevant to why one normally trusts what other people say even though this inference is usually not drawn in an explicit way. Something similar happens when the speaker&#x27;s statement is ambiguous and the audience tries to discover and explain what the speaker could have meant. Abductive reasoning is also common in medicine when a doctor examines the symptoms of their patient in order to arrive at a diagnosis of their underlying cause.

=== Analogical ===
Analogical reasoning involves the comparison of two systems in relation to their similarity. It starts from information about one system and infers information about another system based on the resemblance between the two systems. Expressed schematically, arguments from analogy have the following form: (1) &quot;a&quot; is similar to &quot;b&quot;; (2) &quot;a&quot; has feature &quot;F&quot;; (3) therefore &quot;b&quot; probably also has feature &quot;F&quot;. Analogical reasoning can be used, for example, to infer information about humans from medical experiments on animals: (1) rats are similar to humans; (2) birth control pills affect the brain development of rats; (3) therefore they may also affect the brain development of humans. 

Through analogical reasoning, knowledge can be transferred from one situation or domain to another. Arguments from analogy provide support for their conclusion but do not guarantee its truth. Their strength depends on various factors. The more similar the systems are, the more likely it is that a given feature of one object also characterizes the other object. Another factor concerns not just the degree of similarity but also its relevance. For example, an artificial strawberry made of plastic may be similar to a real strawberry in many respects, including its shape, color, and surface structure. But these similarities are irrelevant to whether the artificial strawberry tastes as sweet as the real one.

Analogical reasoning plays a central role in problem-solving, decision-making, and learning. It can be used both for simple physical characteristics and complex abstract ideas. In science, analogies are often used in models to understand complex phenomena in a simple way. For example, the Bohr model explains the interactions of sub-atomic particles in analogy to how planets revolve around the sun.

== Fallacies ==

A fallacy is an incorrect argument or a faulty form of reasoning. This means that the premises provide no or not sufficient support for the conclusion. Fallacies often appear to be correct on the first impression and thereby seduce people into accepting and using them. In logic, the term &quot;fallacy&quot; does not mean that the conclusion is false. Instead, it only means that some kind of error was committed on the way to reaching the conclusion. An argument can be a fallacy even if, by a fortuitous accident, the conclusion is true. Outside the field of logic, the term &quot;fallacy&quot; is sometimes used in a slightly different sense for a false belief or theory and not for an argument.

Fallacies are usually divided into formal and informal fallacies. Formal fallacies are expressed in a formal language and usually belong to deductive reasoning. Their fault lies in the logical form of the argument, i.e. that it does not follow a valid rule of inference. A well-known formal fallacy is affirming the consequent. It has the following form: (1) &quot;q&quot;; (2) if &quot;p&quot; then &quot;q&quot;; (3) therefore &quot;p&quot;. This fallacy is committed, for example, when a person argues that &quot;the burglars entered by the front door&quot; based on the premises &quot;the burglars forced the lock&quot; and &quot;if the burglars entered by the front door, then they forced the lock&quot;. This fallacy is similar to the valid rule of inference known as modus ponens. It is faulty because the first premise and the conclusion are switched around. Other well-known formal fallacies are denying the antecedent, affirming a disjunct, denying a conjunct, and the fallacy of the undistributed middle.

Informal fallacies are expressed in natural language. Their main fault usually lies not in the form of the argument but has other sources, like its content or context. Some informal fallacies, like some instances of false dilemmas and strawman fallacies, even involve correct deductive reasoning on the formal level. The content of an argument is the idea that is expressed in it. For example, a false dilemma is an informal fallacy that is based on an error in one of the premises. The faulty premise oversimplifies reality: it states that things are either one way or another way but ignore many other viable alternatives. False dilemmas are often used by politicians when they claim that either their proposal is accepted or there will be dire consequences. Such claims usually ignore that various alternatives exist to avoid those consequences, i.e. that their proposal is not the only viable solution.

The strawman fallacy is another informal fallacy. Its error happens on the level of the context. It consists in misrepresenting the view of an opponent and then refuting this view. The refutation itself is often correct but the error lies in the false assumption that the opponent actually defends this view. For example, an alcohol lobbyist may respond to the suggestion to ban alcohol advertisements on television by claiming that it is impossible to make people give up drinking alcohol. This is a strawman fallacy since the suggestion was merely to ban advertisements and not to stop all alcohol consumption.

Ambiguous and vague expressions in natural language are often responsible for the faulty reasoning in informal fallacies. For example, this is the case for fallacies of ambiguity, like the argument &quot;(1) feathers are light; (2) light is opposed to darkness; (3) therefore feathers are opposed to darkness&quot;. The error is found in the ambiguous term &quot;light&quot;, which has one meaning in the first premise (&quot;not heavy&quot;) and a different meaning in the second premise (&quot;visible electromagnetic radiation&quot;).

== As a skill ==
Some theorists discuss logical reasoning in a very wide sense that includes its role as a broad skill responsible for high-quality thinking. In this sense, it is roughly equivalent to critical thinking and includes the capacity to select and apply the appropriate rules of logic to specific situations. It encompasses a great variety of abilities besides drawing conclusions from premises. Examples are to understand a position, to generate and evaluate reasons for and against it as well as to critically assess whether to accept or reject certain information. It is about making judgments and drawing conclusions after careful evaluation and contrasts in this regard with uncritical snap judgments and gut feelings. Other core skills linked to logical reasoning are to assess reasons before accepting a claim and to search for new information if more is needed to reach a reliable conclusion. It also includes the ability to consider different courses of action and compare the advantages and disadvantages of their consequences, to use common sense, and to avoid inconsistencies. The skills responsible for logical reasoning can be learned, trained, and improved.

Logical reasoning is relevant both on the theoretical and practical level. On the theoretical level, it helps decrease the number of false beliefs. A central aspect concerns the abilities used to distinguish facts from mere opinions, like the process of finding and evaluating reasons for and against a position to come to one&#x27;s own conclusion. This includes being able to differentiate between reliable and unreliable sources of information. This matters for effective reasoning since it is often necessary to rely on information provided by other people instead of checking every single fact for oneself. This way, logical reasoning can help the person avoid the effects of propaganda or being manipulated by others. When important information is missing, it is often better to suspend judgment than to jump to conclusions. In this regard, logical reasoning should be skeptical and open-minded at the same time.

On the practical level, logical reasoning concerns the issue of making rational and effective decisions. For many real-life decisions, various courses of action are available to the agent. For each possible action, there can be conflicting reasons, some in favor of it and others opposed to it. In such cases, logical reasoning includes weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks as well as considering their likelihood in order to arrive at a balanced all-things-considered decision. For example, when a person runs out of drinking water in the middle of a hiking trip, they could employ the skills associated with logical reasoning to decide whether to boil and drink water from a stream that might contain dangerous microorganisms rather than break off the trip and hike back to the parking lot. This could include considering factors like assessing how dangerous the microorganisms are and the likelihood that they survive the boiling procedure. It may also involve gathering relevant information to make these assessments, for example, by asking other hikers.

Time also plays a central role in logical reasoning. If one lacks important information, it is often better to delay a decision and look for new information before coming to a conclusion. If the decision is time-sensitive, on the other hand, logical reasoning may imply making a fast decision based on the currently available evidence even if it is very limited. For example, if a friend yells &quot;Duck!&quot; during a baseball game the most logical response may be to blindly trust them and duck instead of demanding an explanation or investigating what might have prompted their exclamation. Generally speaking, the less time there is, the more significant it is to trust intuitions and gut feelings. If there is more time, on the other hand, it becomes important to examine ambiguities and assess contradictory information.

<doc id="637993" wikidata="Q2655664" url="?curid=637993" title="Arawak language">
<text>Arawak (, ), also known as Lokono (Lokono Dian, literally &quot;people&#x27;s talk&quot; by its speakers), is an Arawakan language spoken by the Lokono (Arawak) people of South America in eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It is the eponymous language of the Arawakan language family.

Lokono is an active–stative language.

== History ==
Lokono is a critically endangered language. The Lokono language is most commonly spoken in South America. Some specific countries where this language is spoken include Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Venezuela. The percentage of living fluent speakers with active knowledge of the language is estimated to be 5% of the ethnic population. There are small communities of semi-speakers who have varying degrees of comprehension and fluency in Lokono that keep the language alive. It is estimated that there are around 2,500 remaining speakers (including fluent and semi-fluent speakers). The decline in the use of Lokono as a language of communication is due to its lack of transmission from older speakers to the next generation. The language is not being passed to young children, as they are taught to speak the official languages of their countries.

== Classification ==
The Lokono language is part of the larger Arawakan language family spoken by indigenous people in South and Central America along with the Caribbean. The family spans four countries of Central America — Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua — and eight of South America — Bolivia, Guyana, French Guiana, Surinam, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil (and also formerly Argentina and Paraguay). With about 40 extant languages, it is the largest language family in Latin America.

=== Etymology ===

&quot;Arawak&quot; is a tribal name in reference to the main crop food, the cassava root, commonly known as manioc. The cassava root is a popular staple for millions of people in South America, Asia and Africa. It is a woody shrub grown in tropical or subtropical regions. Speakers of Arawak also identify themselves as &#x27;, which translates as &quot;the people&quot;. They call their language &#x27;, &quot;the people&#x27;s speech&quot;.

Alternative names of the same language include Arawák, Arahuaco, Aruak, Arowak, Arawac, Araguaco, Aruaqui, Arwuak, Arrowukas, Arahuacos, Locono, and Luccumi.

== Geographic distribution ==
Lokono is an Arawakan language most commonly found to be spoken in eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. There are approximately 2,500 native speakers today. The following are regions where Arawak has been found spoken by native speakers.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
William Pet observes an additional in loanwords.
===Vowels===
Pet notes that phonetic realization of varies between [] and [].

== Writing system ==
The Arawak language system has an alphabetical system similar to the Roman Alphabet with some minor changes and new additions to letters.
 
The letters in brackets under each alphabetical letter is the IPA symbol for each letter.
== Grammar ==
The personal pronouns are shown below. The forms on the left are free forms, which can stand alone. The forms on the right are bound forms (prefixes), which must be attached to the front of a verb, a noun, or a postposition.
=== Cross-referencing affixes ===
All verbs are sectioned into transitive, active transitive, and stative intransitive.
&quot;A= Sa=cross referencing prefix&quot;

&quot;O=So= cross referencing suffix&quot;

== Vocabulary ==

=== Gender ===
In the Arawak language, there are two distinct genders of masculine and feminine. They are used in cross-referencing affixes, in demonstratives, in nominalization and in personal pronouns. Typical pronominal genders, for example, are feminine and non-feminine. The markers go back to Arawak third-person singular cross-referencing: feminine &quot;-(r)u,&quot; masculine &quot;-(r)i&quot;

=== Number ===
Arawak Languages do distinguish singular and plural, however plural is optional unless the referent is a person. Markers used are &quot;*-na/-ni&quot; (animate/human plural) and &quot;*-pe&quot; (inanimate/animate non-human plural).

=== Possession ===
Arawak nouns are fragmented into inalienably and alienably possessed. Inalienably crossed nouns include things such as body parts, terms for kinship and common nouns like food selections. Deverbal nominalization belong to that grouping. Both forms of possession are marked with prefixes (A/Sa). Inalienably possessed nouns have what is known as an &quot;unpossessed&quot; form (also known as &quot;absolute&quot;) marked with the suffix &quot;*-tfi or *-hV.&quot; Alienably possessed nouns take one of the suffixes &quot;*-ne/ni, *-te, *-re, *i/e&quot;, or &quot;*-na.&quot; All suffixes used as nominalizers.

=== Negation ===
Arawak languages have a negative prefix &quot;ma-&quot; and attributive-relative prefix &quot;ka-.&quot; An example of the use is &quot;ka-witi-w&quot; (&quot;a woman with good eyes&quot;) and &quot;ma-witti-w&quot; (&quot;a woman with bad eyes&quot;, i.e., a blind woman).

===Tenses===
Tenses are added at the end of a sentence: past tense is indicated with &quot;bura&quot; or &quot;bora&quot; (from &quot;ubura&quot; &quot;before&quot;), future tense with &quot;dikki&quot; (from &quot;adiki&quot; &quot;after&quot;), present continuous tense uses &quot;loko&quot; or &quot;roko&quot;.

<doc id="637998" wikidata="Q1135686" url="?curid=637998" title="Corus Entertainment">
<text>Corus Entertainment Inc. (often simply known as Corus) is a Canadian mass media and television production company. The company was founded in 1987 as Shaw Radio Ltd. as a subsidiary of Shaw Communications and was spun-off from Shaw in 1999. It has prominent holdings in the radio, publishing, and television industries. Corus is headquartered at Corus Quay in Toronto, Ontario.

Corus has a large presence in Canadian broadcasting as owner of the national Global network (15 conventional stations), 37 radio stations, and a portfolio of 30 specialty television services; the company&#x27;s domestic specialty brands includes Flavour Network, Home Network, Showcase, SériesPlus, Slice, Télétoon, W Network, and YTV. It also operates services under brand licensing agreements with A&amp;E Networks (History and Lifetime), Paramount Global (CMT and Nickelodeon), The Walt Disney Company (Disney Channel, Freeform via ABC Spark, and National Geographic), and Warner Bros. Discovery (Cartoon Network, Boomerang, and Adult Swim). It previously held rights to WBD lifestyle brands such as Food Network and HGTV; these moved to Rogers Communications in 2025.

Corus owns the animation studio Nelvana, and children&#x27;s publisher Kids Can Press. The second incarnation of Shaw&#x27;s media division—formed from the properties of the bankrupt Canwest Global—was subsumed by Corus on April 1, 2016, giving it control of the over-the-air Global network and 19 additional specialty channels. In May 2019, Shaw announced that it would sell its shares in Corus for roughly $500 million.

== History ==
=== 1996–2013 ===
==== Origins ====

Shaw Communications, founded in 1966, has entered a foray into conventional broadcasting. Founded by JR Shaw as Shaw Radio on August 27, 1987, it acquired two Red Deer radio stations, CIZZ-FM and CKGY-FM. Further acquisitions by Shaw during this period included CISN-FM Edmonton (1988), CHAY-FM Barrie (1990), CKDK-FM Woodstock (1991), and CFOX-FM and CKLG-AM Vancouver (1992).

The company in 1995 had acquired CUC Broadcasting&#x27;s 34% stake of YTV. Shaw acquired Rogers&#x27; remaining shares of YTV in 1998.

==== Establishment ====
In September 1998, JR Shaw and Shaw Media CEO John Cassaday announced plans for Shaw Communications to spin out its media properties, including radio stations and television specialty channels, into a company which would be known as Corus Entertainment. The spin-out would leave Shaw as a &quot;pure play&quot; telecommunications company. The decision to spin out the properties was meant to comply with current Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) recommendations, which discouraged vertical integration by cable companies that also owned media properties. Corus would be a separate, publicly traded company, first listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in September 1999, but it would still be primarily controlled by the Shaw family.

In September 1999, Corus acquired the broadcasting assets of the Power Corporation of Canada, which included four television stations and sixteen radio stations. One of these stations, CHAU-TV, was later re-sold to Télé Inter-Rives. In October 1999, it was announced that as part of the break-up of Western International Communications (WIC), Corus would acquire the company&#x27;s 12 radio stations and most of its specialty channels, including stakes in Family Channel, SuperChannel and MovieMax!.

==== Growth, acquisitions ====
In September 2000, after negotiations and rumoured offers by other studios, Corus announced that it would acquire the Toronto-based animation studio Nelvana for $540 million; the deal was considered to be a complement to its children&#x27;s television networks (which had often acquired programming from Nelvana), including YTV, Treehouse, and its stakes in Family Channel, Teletoon, and its French counterpart Télétoon. Corus also stated that it planned to use the purchase to help launch a preschool-oriented cable network in the U.S.

In March 2001, in response to complaints by the CRTC over its near-monopoly on ownership of children&#x27;s specialty channels in Canada, Corus sold its stake in Family Channel to Astral Media for $126.9 million, making it a sister channel to The Movie Network and giving them full ownership. Corus also sold its stake in the Western Canadian pay-per-view service Viewers Choice to Shaw Communications for $22.6 million, and acquired the Women&#x27;s Television Network (WTN) from Shaw (which had bought its parent, Moffat Communications, for its cablesystem assets) for $132.6 million. In August 2002, Corus sold CKDO and CKGE-FM to Durham Radio.

In May 2002, Corus announced that it had acquired a 50% stake in Locomotion, a Latin American Spanish-language channel focusing primarily of animated television series targeting teens and young adults. Hearst Corporation owned the other half.

In 2003, Doug Murphy replaced John Cassaday as CEO.

In March 2004, Corus and Astral announced that it would acquire and swap radio stations in Quebec; Corus acquired the Radiomédia network (including CKAC) and Quebec City&#x27;s CFOM, while Astral acquired CFVM-FM Amqui, CJOI-FM and CIKI-FM Rimouski, CFZZ-FM Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and CJDM-FM Drummondville. Corus also sold its Red Deer, Alberta stations CKGY-FM and CIZZ-FM to Newcap Radio.

In July 2007, Corus acquired CKBT-FM and CJZZ-FM from Canwest. In June 2008, CHRC was sold to the ownership group of the Quebec Remparts hockey team.

==== Additional partnerships, Corus Québec sale ====
Also in August 2007, Corus Entertainment announced a partnership with Hearst Corporation to launch Cosmopolitan TV. In March 2008, CTVglobemedia sold Canadian Learning Television to Corus for $73 million

Corus launched a Canadian version of Nickelodeon on November 2, 2009, replacing the localized version of Discovery Kids. In 2010, Corus&#x27;s sister company Shaw Communications re-entered the broadcasting industry through its acquisition of the media assets of the bankrupt Canwest, which re-formed the Shaw Media division.

On April 30, 2010, Corus announced that it would sell its Québec radio stations, with the exception of CKRS, to Cogeco for $80 million, pending CRTC approval. Corus cited their low profitability in comparison to their stations elsewhere as reasoning for the sale. On June 25, it was reported that Corus had agreed to sell CKRS to Radio Saguenay, a local business group. The sale of the Corus Québec stations was approved by the CRTC on December 17, 2010, on the condition that Cogeco-owned CJEC-FM and Corus-owned CFEL-FM and CKOY-FM be sold to another party by December 2011. On January 13, 2011, competing broadcaster Astral Media announced that they would seek legal action to stop the sale of these stations to Cogeco, citing the fact that it would own more stations than Astral in the Montreal market, making the competition unfair.

On September 28, 2010, the company relocated its broadcasting headquarters from 64 Jefferson Avenue to the newly built Corus Quay.

On November 9, 2010, Hasbro Studios signed an agreement with Corus to broadcast their productions on its networks.

In March 2012, Corus and Shaw launched ABC Spark, a localized version of U.S. cable network ABC Family, with Shaw owning 49%. In July 2012, the Teletoon Canada venture (50% with Astral Media) similarly launched a Canadian version of Cartoon Network and Adult Swim.

=== 2013–2024 ===
==== Re-organization ====
In March 2013, as part of Bell Media&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Astral Media, Corus reached a deal to acquire Astral&#x27;s stakes in Historia, Séries+, and TELETOON Canada Inc., as well as the Ottawa radio stations CJOT-FM and CKQB-FM, for $400.6 million. This aspect of the deal, intended to quell concerns from the CRTC regarding Bell&#x27;s total market share after the merger, was approved by the Competition Bureau on March 18, 2013. In an unrelated deal, Corus also announced that it would acquire Shaw Media&#x27;s stakes in ABC Spark, Historia, and Séries+ in exchange for cash and its minority stake in Food Network Canada (quickly ended in April 2013). Corus indicated that these purchases were meant to help the company expand its television holdings in the competitive Quebec market. Corus also planned to open a new office in Montreal following the sale. On January 1, 2014, the acquisition was completed.

On September 1, 2013, Corus&#x27;s television business was reorganized into five divisions; Corus Kids, Corus Women and Family, Corus Content Distribution and Pay TV, Corus Airtime Sales and Corus Média (for French-language assets). The Corus Kids division was subdivided into operations for their eight TV channels, Nelvana, and Kids Can Press.

==== Acquisition of Disney Channel program rights ====
On April 16, 2015, Corus Entertainment announced that it had reached an agreement with the Disney–ABC Television Group to acquire long-term, Canadian multi-platform rights to distribute Disney Channel&#x27;s programming library and associated brands. As a result, Canadian versions of Disney Channel in both languages: English and French. Launched on September 1, 2015. Further re-alignment occurred the same day, with the discontinuation of the Teletoon Retro brand: the English version assumed the intellectual property of Cartoon Network (which widened its carriage), and the French version being replaced by the aforementioned Disney La Chaîne.

==== Wind-down of Movie Central ====
On November 20, 2015, Corus announced, as a result of a strategic review, it would cease operating its premium Movie Central and Encore Avenue services on March 1, 2016, in order to focus more on its national specialty channels. Subscribers to the networks were migrated to Bell Media&#x27;s The Movie Network and TMN Encore—ending the regional monopolies that TMN and Movie Central held in eastern and western Canada respectively. Bell Media made a payment of $211 million to Corus for assistance in coordinating this migration. Bell also quietly announced that it would acquire Corus&#x27; stake in HBO Canada, giving them full ownership.

==== Acquisition of Shaw Media ====
On January 13, 2016, Corus Entertainment announced that it would acquire Shaw Media for $2.65 billion, with Shaw Communications taking a 39% share of Corus stock. The division consisted primarily of the broadcasting assets of the former Canwest, including the over-the-air Global Television Network and 19 other specialty channels, such as Food Network, HGTV, Showcase, History, and Slice. The transaction was being used to fund Shaw Communications&#x27; purchase of wireless carrier Wind Mobile. Corus&#x27; CEO, Doug Murphy, described the transaction as being a &quot;transformational acquisition that redefines Corus and Canada&#x27;s media landscape&quot;.

As the Shaw family&#x27;s assets are considered a single entity for regulatory purposes by the CRTC, the CRTC officially considered the acquisition to be a reorganization of their assets, and thus exempted it from its concentration of media ownership and tangible benefits rules. The reorganization was approved on March 23, 2016, and completed on April 1, 2016. At the same time, multiple Shaw Media executives joined Corus (including its former CEO Barbara Williams, as its new executive VP and COO), and the company adopted a new logo.

==== Attempted sale of Historia and Séries+ ====
On October 17, 2017, Bell Media announced its intent to acquire Historia and Séries+ from Corus for $200 million, which would have reunited them with former Astral Media channels, such as Canal D, Canal Vie, Vrak (although the network was later shut down on October 1, 2023), and Z. Corus stated that the two channels were not part of its &quot;strategic priorities&quot; at this time. On May 28, 2018, the sale was blocked and rejected by the Competition Bureau, for violating conditions imposed on Bell that prohibits the company from regaining ownership of divested Astral properties for 10 years.

==== Expanded partnerships, sale of Shaw Communications share, and network closures ====
On June 13, 2018, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that the Shaw family was exploring the sale of its shares in Corus, in order to fund future expansion of the Freedom Mobile business. In its third-quarter financial report, Corus reported a year-over-year loss of $91 million, in comparison to a profit of $133 million in 2017. Corus also took a $1.013 billion write-down on its broadcasting businesses, resulting in a quarterly loss of $935.9 million, and cut its dividend to 24 cents. Doug Murphy acknowledged changes to the market climate for television, and stated that the company would have a larger focus on automated and &quot;microtargeted&quot; advertising sales going forward (in particular, using artificial intelligence to analyse information from set-top boxes to determine the best advertising strategies).

On March 4, 2019, it was announced that a full-time Canadian version of Adult Swim would be launched. The block was shut down on that same day, followed by the Teletoon at Night block on March 31, 2019 and Action was relaunched as Adult Swim on April 1, 2019.

In May 2019, Shaw announced it would sell its shares in Corus in a secondary offering, at a valuation of $548 million. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the month.

In June 2019, Corus was announced as a launch partner for Amazon Prime Video Channels in Canada, offering a subscription-based bundle known as StackTV with access to live and on-demand programs from five Global TV stations and eleven Corus specialty services. At the same time, Corus would also launch a separate Nickelodeon SVOD channel known as Nick+.

IFC Canada and CosmoTV ceased operations on September 30, 2019. FYI would later close on December 31, 2019.

In March 2020, Corus replaced the individual mobile apps for most of its specialty channels with the &quot;Global TV App&quot;, which featured content from Global, Global News, Food Network, HGTV, History, Showcase, Slice, and W Network on-launch. The app encompasses the TV Everywhere streaming of programming from the networks for their subscribers, and also features free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) content from Corus&#x27;s networks.

In June and July 2020, Corus reached two content agreements with subsidiaries of Comcast, including Canadian rights to original series produced for its U.S. streaming service Peacock (NBCUniversal) on June 23, 2020, and Canadian rights to original productions from British subsidiary Sky Studios via NBCUniversal Global Distribution (the agreements exclude DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s television subsidiary, which has a pre-existing output agreement with WildBrain).

BBC Canada was shut down on December 31, 2020; Blue Ant Media would launch a spiritual successor, BBC First, in March 2021.

In October 2021, Corus partnered with Discovery, Inc. on Canadian marketing for its Discovery+ streaming service.

DIY Network was rebranded to a Canadian version of Magnolia Network on March 28, 2022.

On September 1, 2022, Nick+ was decommissioned and replaced by Teletoon+, which is primarily drawn from the Cartoon Network Studios and Warner Bros. Animation libraries. Several days prior to the Teletoon+ launch, Corus lost the rights to air several Nickelodeon shows on their networks, those shows were moved to Paramount+ moving forward.

In December 2022, Corus partnered with Paramount Global on launching its FAST service Pluto TV in Canada, with Corus handling Canadian marketing, advertising sales, and contributing channels featuring content from its library and Global News.

On February 21, 2023, Corus announced that Teletoon&#x27;s English channel would be relaunched as Cartoon Network on March 27, 2023, and that the existing Cartoon Network channel in Canada would be relaunched as the first Canadian version of sibling brand Boomerang.

==== Financial issues, loss of licensing agreements, and proposed sale ====
On May 25, 2023, Eastlink revealed that it was in a carriage dispute with Corus, resulting in the removal of all Corus-owned specialty channels and Global On Demand from its services on June 27, 2023. The dispute ended on June 6, 2024, with all of its channels restored to its services, albeit with subscribers required to obtain them via Corus-specific theme packs.

On July 13, 2023, Corus announced the sale of animation software developer Toon Boom to the private equity firm TPG Inc. for $147.5 million to help pay down its debts. On October 27, 2023, Corus announced the suspension of its dividend and intention to redirect the use of free cash flow from dividends to debt repayment.

On May 13, 2024, the CRTC approved an &quot;exceptional&quot; request from Corus to reduce its mandatory expenditures into programs of national interest (PNI) from 8.5% to 5% of revenue, allowing it to be reallocated to other forms of Canadian content such as local news. The measure was intended primarily to help offset the loss of news funding that occurred as a result of the sale of Shaw Communications to Rogers Communications, who reallocated Shaw&#x27;s community television expenditures in metropolitan markets (previously allocated to Global stations) to its own Citytv stations. The Canadian Media Producers Association has requested an appeal, citing that Corus is non-compliant with the requirement that 75% of the PNI expenditures must involve independent producers.

On June 6, 2024, Corus disclosed that Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) had decided not to renew some of its brand licensing agreements with the company, which will expire at the end of 2024. While specific details had yet to be revealed, Murphy made references to it being an &quot;unfortunate example of inequitable structural relationships in the Canadian media and telecom industries, particularly affecting independent broadcasters like Corus&quot;. On June 10, 2024, rival broadcaster Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced an exclusive licensing agreement with WBD, under which the rights to all WBD lifestyle and factual brands will move to Rogers platforms beginning in 2025. In addition, the rights to Bravo original programming (which had largely been carried by Slice) would also move to Rogers in September 2024 under an agreement with NBCUniversal, resulting in the launch of a new Bravo-branded channel. The agreements had a negative impact on Corus&#x27;s share price, to the point that a TD analyst suggested that losing the rights to these brands would make the company&#x27;s shares worthless. Corus stated that they would continue to operate many of the affected networks under new brands, with their existing Canadian content along with alternate imported content, but later clarified that some channels may be shuttered instead of rebranded.

On June 17, 2024, amid these uncertainties, Murphy announced that he would retire as CEO; he was jointly succeeded by Corus CFO Troy Reeb and executive vice president of networks and content John Gossling. That month, Corus had also begun cuts at Global News, and shut down the all-news/all-traffic formats at its Edmonton and Vancouver AM stations 880 CHQT and 730 CKGO (with the stations becoming interim simulcasts of their parent news/talk stations 630 CHED and 980 CKNW pending further developments). The broadcaster later announced that the Oprah Winfrey Network would cease operating under Corus on September 1, 2024, reducing the specialty channel headcount to 32. On July 15, citing a &quot;challenging advertising environment&quot;, Gossling stated during a third-quarter earnings report that the company planned to cut 300 more positions by the end of August (a total of 800 since September 2022) and &quot;aggressively&quot; cut costs. On July 17, Athena Georgaklis departed Nelvana, and the studio halted its development slate for the rest of the year. On August 14, Corus closed another AM station, Hamilton&#x27;s CHML. On August 28, Corus announced that it would relocate CHED&#x27;s call letters and programming to the former CHQT signal on October 9, 2024, citing improved signal coverage.

That month, Corus filed a complaint against Rogers with the CRTC, alleging abuse of a dominant position. The company cited Rogers&#x27; undue preference of foreign streaming service Disney+ over Corus&#x27; licensed Disney Branded Television specialty services, including offering plans for its ad-supported version (whose Canadian advertising sales are handled by Rogers) bundled with television subscriptions, and giving Disney+ greater prominence on the program guide and search tools of its Ignite TV platform. It also alleged that the CRTC had done little to enforce monitoring provisions on Rogers&#x27; dealings with independent broadcasters following the Shaw acquisition. Rogers dismissed the accusations, alleging that Corus had failed to adapt its &quot;broken business model&quot; to changes in viewing habits, and citing the declining viewership and Canadian content investments into the services.

Corus began to transition Food Network, HGTV, and Slice to alternate foreign programming sources in the 2024–25 season, with Slice pivoting to including more true crime programming and picking up a number of We TV programs, and announcing on September 18, 2024, that Food Network and HGTV would rebrand as Flavour Network and Home Network respectively on December 30. The schedules of both channels will rely primarily on new and existing Canadian productions, and new acquisitions (including content from Fifth Season, The Roku Channel, PBS, Studio Ramsay Global, and various international networks). Some repeats of Food Network and HGTV series will continue airing on the rebranded channels for a period. Reeb stated that he considered the two channels&#x27; original productions to have historically been their main draws, and felt the new, in-house brands would provide Corus with more flexibility to &quot;go more unique&quot; with their programming and be &quot;a little younger, a little fresher, a little more diverse than what people have traditionally been used to on those lifestyle services&quot;. In addition, sister channels Cooking Channel and Magnolia Network ceased operations under Corus on January 1, 2025. Rogers Sports &amp; Media launched a second incarnation of the latter that same day.

On September 16, 2024, citing internal sources familiar with the situation,&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that Quebecor had been pursuing an acquisition of Corus. Representatives of the company had met with Corus executive Heather Shaw earlier in the year, and Quebecor had reportedly sent an offer to the company several weeks prior, but had not yet received a response. Corus and Quebecor declined to comment. On September 29, amid an approaching deadline for a debt relief agreement, it was further reported that Quebecor had asked Corus&#x27; lenders to write down at least 60% of its debt in a restructuring that would enable a potential acquisition. However, it was reported that analysts were bullish on the proposed offer due to the instability of the television industry.

On October 25, 2024, Corus reported a 21% year-over-year decrease in revenue (approximately $26 million) in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, and a 16% year-over-year decrease in annual consolidated earnings over 2023. Gossling cited the 2023 Hollywood labour disputes, and an oversupply of digital advertising inventory caused by the growth of competing ad-supported streaming services, and modest growth in its own streaming services. He stated that Corus planned to &quot;[fight] back against the continued encroachment of U.S. tech giants into the Canadian advertising market&quot; by focusing on &quot;the value of our content, of our communities and of our people.&quot; It was also announced that Corus had renegotiated its credit agreements with RBC Capital Markets and TD Securities, increasing its maximum cash flow-to-debt ratio through March 2025. On November 1, 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Corus had hired Jefferies Group to explore a potential sale. In November 2024, Corus Radio underwent a round of layoffs across its news/talk stations, impacting on-air talent in multiple markets; a new syndicated program hosted by Ben Mulroney premiered across the stations shortly afterward.

== Relationship with Shaw Communications ==

Corus Entertainment was formed from the media assets that had been owned by Shaw Communications in the years before. From 1999 to early 2023, Shaw and Corus operated as independent, publicly traded companies; nonetheless, they had a common majority shareholder in the Shaw family, and some reports indicated that the two companies continued to have a close relationship. For several years, Corus managed advertising operations (such as TV listings channels) for Shaw&#x27;s cable systems, although this operation has since been discontinued. Executives have also occasionally moved between the two companies, with former Corus Television president Paul Robertson joining Shaw to head Shaw Media (the former Canwest broadcasting operations) in 2010.

Following Shaw&#x27;s 2010 acquisition of Canwest&#x27;s TV assets, the two companies incidentally became partners in certain channels including Dusk (later replaced by ABC Spark) and the Canadian version of Food Network; these two partnerships were unwound in April 2013. Otherwise, there was no connection or common programming between Corus&#x27;s conventional and specialty television operations and those of Shaw Media. For example, Corus owns three over-the-air TV stations which were long-time CBC affiliates, and which agreed in 2015 to switch to Bell Media&#x27;s CTV network, despite Shaw owning the rival Global network at the time. Following the merger of the Shaw Media properties into Corus, the Corus-operated CTV affiliates began transitioning to Global programming in September 2016 (beginning with CTV News programming being phased out in favour of Global News), and eventually switching to Global full-time after their affiliation expired on August 27, 2018. Shaw also continued to direct a portion of its CRTC-mandated local expression funding to Corus-owned Global stations following the transfer of Shaw Media, amounting to approximately $13 million per year.

As Corus Entertainment and Shaw Communications were both effectively controlled by JR Shaw, the CRTC considered them to be one entity regarding the &quot;Diversity of Voices&quot; policy, and a vertical integration rule which requires television providers to carry three channels owned by unaffiliated parties for each co-owned channel they offer: due to the effective control, Corus networks that are carried by Shaw television services were subject to this rule.

With the closing of the acquisition of Shaw Communications by Rogers Communications in early 2023, there are no meaningful ties between Corus and the combined telecom company, except that the Shaw family is now a significant minority shareholder in Rogers while remaining the majority voting shareholder in Corus. The CRTC decision approving the Rogers-Shaw deal confirms that the regulator considers Corus to &quot;remain unrelated to Rogers&quot; following the transaction, resulting in Corus becoming an independent programmer under the commission&#x27;s regulations. Rogers withdrew the community television expenditures that had been previously allocated to Corus&#x27; Global stations, and moved them to its own Citytv stations.

== Sponsorships and industry partnerships ==
Corus is an industry sponsor of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus; Gary Maavara, Corus&#x27; Corporate Secretary, sits on the Waterloo campus&#x27; advisory board. The company also funds a couple of endowed chair positions, including chair in Women in Management at the Ivey Business School (London, Ontario, Canada) beginning in 2003, and a chair in Communications Strategy at the Rotman School of Management (Toronto) beginning in 2002.

<text>Samuel Hill (13 May 1857 – 26 February 1931), was an American businessman, lawyer, railroad executive, and advocate of good roads. He substantially influenced the Pacific Northwest region&#x27;s economic development in the early 20th century.

His projects include the Peace Arch, a monument to 100 years of peace between the United States and Canada, on the border between Blaine, Washington, and Surrey, British Columbia, and the Maryhill Museum of Art. Although his promotion of paved modern roads is possibly his greatest legacy, he is now best remembered for building the Stonehenge replica in Maryhill, Washington.

==Early life and education==
Sam Hill was born into a Quaker family in Deep River, North Carolina. His family was displaced by the American Civil War and Sam grew up after the war in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Hill graduated from Haverford College in 1878 (also his father&#x27;s alma mater). At Haverford he studied Latin, Greek, French, and German as well as mathematics, science, English literature, logic, rhetoric, and political science.

He attended Harvard University for a year to receive a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1879. At Harvard he continued his Latin and history (&quot;&quot;Colonial History of America&quot; under Henry Cabot Lodge) and studied forensics and philosophy (&quot;German Philosophy of the Present Day&quot; and &quot;Advanced Political Economy&quot;&quot;). Despite attending only one year, he became an extremely active Harvard alumnus, serving for several years on the Harvard Board of Overseers even though it required many transcontinental trips each year to attend meetings. He also joined (and, at times, led) Harvard Clubs in several cities in the U.S.

==Early career and relocation to Seattle==
After Sam Hill graduated from Haverford College in 1878 and Harvard University in 1879, he returned to Minneapolis to practice law. A number of successful lawsuits against the Great Northern Railway attracted the attention of the railway&#x27;s general manager James J. Hill, who hired Sam to represent the railway. In 1888 Sam Hill married James Hill&#x27;s eldest daughter Mary.

For over a decade, Hill played an important role in his father-in-law&#x27;s business endeavors, both at the Great Northern and as president of the Minneapolis Trust Company. However, around 1900 they had some type of falling out, the nature and degree of which is unclear; it is not even clear whether the falling out was over business matters, Sam and Mary&#x27;s difficult marriage, or possible early symptoms of Sam&#x27;s manic tendencies. In any event, the break was not a sharp one: The two men continued a friendly correspondence in business matters.

After a 1901 journey across Russia on the then not-quite-completed Trans-Siberian Railway, Hill settled in 1902 in Seattle, Washington, where he had major interests in the Seattle Gas and Electric Company, which was focused mainly in the coal gas business.

Hill had announced his intention to settle in Seattle in December 1900, but his wife Mary did not take well to the Northwest and moved back to Minneapolis after six months in Seattle, with their two children and without Sam. He stayed in Seattle and embarked on a number of ventures in the Pacific Northwest.

==World traveller==

Sam Hill was an &quot;inveterate globetrotter&quot;.
He was fluent in German, French, and Italian, and learned at least a moderate amount of Russian. Hill made at least fifty separate trips to Europe in the course of his lifetime and visited Japan nine times between 1897 and 1922. All of Hill&#x27;s extensive travels were during an era when transportation was limited to surface vehicles and vessels.

In the early 20th century, Hill was the only American member of the Geographic Society of Germany. He continually gathered harbor depth soundings and information about ocean temperatures in order to map ocean currents. He had this information added to high-quality custom-made globes of German manufacture repeatedly commissioned from 1902–1914, which Hill gave as gifts.

Among the friends Hill made in his travels was King Albert I of Belgium, who made him a Commander of the Crown and Honorary Belgian Consul for Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Hill and his friend Joseph Joffre (the Marshal of France) made an around-the-world trip together in 1922. He also befriended Queen Marie of Romania, who granted him the Order of the Crown in the Degree of the Grand Cross. Her 1926 visit to the United States was largely at his invitation.

==Enterprises==
After leaving the employ of his father-in-law J.J. Hill in 1900, Sam Hill undertook a variety of business ventures and other projects, with varied results.

===Utility companies===
His Seattle Gas and Electric Company was continually in hard-fought rivalry with other utilities, most notably head-on competition with the Citizens&#x27; Light and Power Company, whose leadership included several defectors from Hill&#x27;s company. Ultimately, after a price war, Hill was able to sell the company&#x27;s gas facilities to the consolidated Seattle Lighting Company in 1904 on favorable terms.

Other ventures into utilities was less successful: The Home Telephone Company of Portland pioneered rotary dial telephones in the region, but ultimately this independent telephone company lost out to the better-integrated Bell System. Its stockholders were wiped out, and its bondholders – Hill himself was the largest of these – ultimately received 70 cents on the dollar.

The Deep Water Coal and Iron Company in Alabama was another business failure. At the end of his life the shares in this last enterprise were worthless, due in part to the Great Depression.

===Maryhill community===
Starting in 1907, Sam Hill bought up most of what had been a small settlement called &quot;Columbia&quot; or &quot;Columbus&quot; near the Columbia River in Klickitat County, Washington, which he envisioned as a new community in the Inland Empire. He named the parcel Maryhill, after his wife and his daughter Mary – neither of whom ever actually lived there.

His original plan was to develop it as a farming community of Quakers, but Sam was the only known Quaker resident.
Taken as a whole, his attempt to create the Maryhill community was one of Hill&#x27;s least successful investments: He spent at least US$600,000 that never paid back in any significant measure.

===Golf course and restaurant===
A more modest, but successful undertaking was a golf course and a large, simple restaurant at Semiahmoo, just north of the U.S.–Canada border and Hill&#x27;s Peace Arch. The restaurant was basically an early fast food establishment. During Prohibition the restaurant benefited from being on the Canadian side of the border, where alcoholic beverages could be served legally.

==Advocate for paved roads==

Sam Hill devoted much attention to advocating construction of modern roads in Washington and Oregon.
In September 1899 Hill created the Washington State Good Roads Association which persuaded the Washington State Legislature to create the Washington State Department of Transportation in 1905. He also advocated the use of convict labor to build roads.

Hill&#x27;s land around Maryhill proved useful for his advocacy. From 1909–1913 he laid of asphalt-paved Macadam road at his own expense (US$100,000). It was the first such road in the Pacific Northwest and Hill experimented over its length with seven different paving techniques. The part of this road that remains – now called the Maryhill Loops Road – is normally open to pedestrians and bicyclists and closed to motor traffic. It is the site of annual longboard races and downhill bicycle events.

In 1907, Hill persuaded the University of Washington to establish the United States&#x27; first chair in highway engineering. He could not persuade the State of Washington to build a highway on the north bank of the Columbia River, but in 1913 Oregon governor Oswald West and the Oregon Legislative Assembly visited Maryhill to inspect his experimental prototype road. Subsequently, the State of Oregon built the scenic Columbia River Highway, which linked coastal Astoria, Oregon and The Dalles, Oregon. In recognition of his influence, a plaque honoring him was placed along Historic Columbia River Highway, at Chanticleer Point, Oregon.

Also in honor of his advocacy for good roads the bridge near Maryhill for U.S. Route 97 across the Columbia River was named the Sam Hill Memorial Bridge.

Sam Hill was also a strong advocate of better roads for Japan, and of Japanese-American friendship, which earned him the Third Class Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1922.

==Monuments and institutions==
Sam Hill built two notable monuments and an art museum, and purchased the private Minneapolis Athenaeum and donated it to the city.

===Maryhill Stonehenge===

The Stonehenge replica at Maryhill commemorates the dead of World War I. It was built by Hill as a reminder that in the present day people are still being sacrificed to the god of war.

===Maryhill Art Museum===

Hill began to build a mansion at Maryhill, but the project was not completed in his lifetime due to a combination of financial reversals and his frustration at the State of Washington&#x27;s failure to build a road on the north bank of the Columbia or to otherwise make the area readily accessible.

At the urging of his friend Loie Fuller, Sam decided to re-purpose the building as an art museum. The museum was dedicated by Queen Marie of Romania in 1926, but did not open to the public until 1940, nine years after Hill&#x27;s death.

===Peace Arch===

The Peace Arch, where today&#x27;s Interstate 5 highway crosses the U.S.–Canada border, celebrates peaceful relations and the open border between the two nations.

===Minneapolis Athenaeum===

Hill served for a time as vice president of the Minneapolis Athenaeum, a private subscription library, and recruited George Putnam as its librarian in 1884. In 1907, he donated a collection of Chinese prints. He eventually acquired all the stock of the Athenaeum Company, which he donated to the public Minneapolis Foundation.

==Politics==
Hill identified as a Republican and at times was active in the party. He disliked Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s trust-busting and thought that William Howard Taft was such a disastrous choice for president that he openly endorsed William Jennings Bryan in 1908, and Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and 1916. He eventually came to oppose Wilson some time after the end of World War I.

He was generally ill-disposed toward labor unions.

==Personal and family life==
===Marriage===
Sam Hill married Marie Francis Hill (also known as Mamie Hill and, after their marriage, as Mary Hill Hill), a daughter of James J. Hill, on 6 September 1888. A generous wedding gift from her father placed them immediately into the ranks of the wealthy.

Their two children were Mary Mendenhall Hill (born 3 July 1889) and James Nathan Branson Hill (born 23 August 1893). Mary was Catholic and Sam agreed that their children would be raised Catholic. Sam was a Quaker, but over the next decade or two he maintained excellent relations with various Catholic clergy – even some close friendships.
Their marriage was never a love-match and by 1900 when Sam had decided to settle in Seattle, the marriage was coming apart. Mary left Sam in Seattle and moved back to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area with their children; she eventually moved to Washington, D.C.

Mary never returned to Seattle, but up to 1907 Sam continued to visit her in the Midwest or back East at least twice a year. He even bought an estate at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where Sam hoped he and Mary would occasionally stay together, but their relationship continued to grow cold. Because she was Catholic, a divorce was out of the question for Mary; the possibility might not even have been discussed.

Mary increasingly withdrew from the world: By 1921 she was described by the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; as &quot;virtually an invalid&quot;, although she lived until 1947.

As for their children, daughter Mary suffered all of her life from emotional and mental problems, and spent much of her life institutionalized. Sam and Mary&#x27;s son James N.B. Hill lived the life of a wealthy man, but never impressed his father&#x27;s biographer as having made any particular mark on the world.

===Other children===
It is not clear whether Sam had been unfaithful to his wife before she abandoned him but he certainly did not remain faithful afterward. He had at least three children by other women whom he provided for by setting up insurance policies, trusts in their names, etc.

One of these children is identified by Hill biographer John E. Tuhy, writing in 1983, only as a &quot;son who lives in British Columbia&quot;.

Another was Elizabeth Ehrens (born 27 December 1914). Her mother was Annie Laurie Whelan, Sam&#x27;s secretary at the Home Telephone Company. Elizabeth was legitimized by her mother&#x27;s marriage of convenience to a German-Swiss man named Henry Ehrens who soon returned permanently to Europe. The couple were granted a divorce in 1918.

Sam Hill&#x27;s last child was Sam Bettle Hill (born August 1928, died 1997) son by Mona Bell, a flamboyant bareback rider turned reporter; who allegedly appeared in Buffalo Bill Cody&#x27;s Wild West Show.

The year before their child was born, Sam bought Bell on the Columbia River and built her a 22-room house which was eventually demolished for the construction of the Bonneville Dam. Sam arranged a marriage of convenience for Mona Bell to his cousin Edgar Hill, again allowing his child to be raised as legitimate, and this time as a legal member of his natural father&#x27;s family.

===Character and mental health===
Hill&#x27;s biographer John E. Tuhy (&quot;Sam Hill: The Prince of Castle Nowhere&quot;, 1983) occasionally questions aspects of Hill&#x27;s own account of his life and doings or finds contradictions in anecdotes told at various times. He believes that Hill was at least somewhat manic-depressive and sees strong signs of a manic, or at least hypomanic, state in his many, often abortive projects in the 1920s and possibly of paranoia in his belief that the Soviet Union was out to harm him.

Tuhy raises the possibility that some early aspect of this &quot;instability&quot; might have played a part in Sam&#x27;s parting of ways in business from James J. Hill. A 1901 letter from Sam to James suggests that Sam believed his father-in-law was at least in some degree disappointed in him: He writes about having &quot;&quot;often been an embarrassment to you&quot;, even though the historical record shows no indication of any significant business errors on Sam&#x27;s part during his association with his father-in-law.

==Death and burial monument==

In 1931 Hill went to Salem to speak to the Oregon State Legislature regarding the need to regulate trucks, in order to protect the condition of highways; he intended to follow this with a similar address to the Washington State Legislature. He became acutely ill on the way and died from natural causes aged 74 years. The recorded cause of death is &quot;an abscess of the lesser peritoneal cavity which had ruptured into the stomach, producing fatal / terminal hemorrhages.&quot;&quot;

Hill chose a ledge below his Stonehenge replica for his burial site, and designed his own monument. His original monument did not last, and has since been replaced.

<text>Ipsus or Ipsos () or Ipsous (Ἴψους), was a town of ancient Phrygia a few miles below Synnada. The place itself never was of any particular note, but it is celebrated in history for the great battle fought in its plains, in 301 BCE, by the aged Antigonus and his son Demetrius against the combined forces of Cassander, Lysimachus, and Seleucus, in which Antigonus lost his conquests and his life. From Hierocles and the Acts of Councils, we learn that in the seventh and eighth centuries it was the see of a Christian bishop. No longer the seat of a residential bishop, Ipsus remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.

Its site is located near Çayırbağ in Asiatic Turkey.

<text>Snoghøj is a southern suburb of Fredericia, Denmark (at 55.52°N and 9.72°E), between Erritsø and Middelfart that developed because of the Højskole (&quot;folk high school&quot;) that was built there. The town has a population of nearly 3,000 people, and an average of 16 snow days and 97 rain days per year. The average temperature is 2 degrees Celsius in the winter, and 14 degrees Celsius in the summer.

<text>James &quot;Jock&quot; Ritchie Haston (1913–1986) was a Trotskyist politician and General Secretary of the Revolutionary Communist Party in Great Britain.

==Early years==
Haston was born in Edinburgh and went to sea in the merchant navy where he became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). He moved to Trotskyism in the mid 1930s, after splitting with the CPGB in 1934 upon watching Soviet ships break the public trade boycott of Nazi Germany. The Paddington group, which he led, joined the Militant Group led by Denzil Dean Harber, and in 1937 when a group of South African Trotskyists appeared in London, it was Haston who moved their acceptance of membership in the Trotskyist group.

The South Africans were led by Ralph Lee (born Raphael Levy), hence they were referred to as the &quot;Lee Group,&quot; and had been active in that country. A dispute with the Communist Party of South Africa was to follow them to Britain however, and it was alleged that Lee had stolen strike funds from a group of workers. These allegations would in time be proven to be lies, but were reported to the Militant Group by Charlie van Gelderen, an earlier immigrant from South Africa, and led to the split of those members of the group working with Lee.

By the time the truth had been established, and the International Secretariat of the Trotskyist movement had exonerated Lee, the damage had been done, and the comrades had formed a new organisation. The new group known as the Workers International League (WIL) was organised in late 1937. In its first days, the small group was led by Lee, but when he returned to South Africa in 1941 Haston became the leading figure within the growing organisation. He also formed a personal alliance with Millie Lee at this time.

In contrast to the official British section of the Fourth International, the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL), the WIL was to experience serious growth in this period recruiting supporters from the CPGB, the RSL and from within the Labour Party. Again, unlike the official section, the WIL accepted the Fourth International Proletarian Military Policy (PMP) although not without an internal struggle that pitted a minority around Haston, Millie Lee (&quot;né&quot; Kuhn) and Sam Levy against Ted Grant and Gerry Healy. Haston emerged the victor from this factional tussle, and the PMP was adapted to the needs of the WIL.

Haston was also a member of the delegation which was sent to Ireland early in the war to prepare a fall back party centre in the event of being made illegal, and having to function underground as had happened to revolutionaries in the previous war. In the event they remained legal, although they were persecuted at one point and the Government spied on them, and the delegation returned to Britain one by one. While in Ireland, they recruited additional supporters to their cause, aiding in the establishment of an Irish Trotskyist movement. Haston was the last to return from Ireland and was arrested and jailed as he was travelling on false papers, his own having been passed to a comrade evading military service.

After 1941, and the turn of the CPGB to support of the war, the WIL recruited a number of militants from the CPGB in large part due to their concentration on industrial work. They also sought and succeeded in recruiting from the declining Independent Labour Party, picking up members in the Tyneside region. When an apprentices&#x27; dispute developed in that area they were then well placed to intervene and as a result Haston was to find himself in jail.

This short term behind bars was because the Trades Disputes Act of 1927 was used against the supporters of the strike among whom the WIL were prominent. Their earlier support for unofficial strikes in the coalfields, particularly in Kent, had also drawn upon them the attention of the authorities.

==Leadership ==
Shortly after this dispute, the WIL was to merge with the Revolutionary Socialist League the factionally divided official section of the Fourth International (FI), to become the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). Haston was by this time seen as the foremost leader of the Trotsky movement in Britain.

Like the WIL, the new party was opposed to the electoral truce of the war years between the Labour and Conservative parties. However, they had been far too small to be able to break the truce in earlier by-elections, so when the Neath Division fell open they sought to take advantage, and Haston was the obvious choice of candidate.

Despite the RCP lacking a branch in Neath at the start of the campaign, Haston was able to poll 1,781 votes in the 1945 Neath by-election. An RCP branch was constructed and literature sales were relatively large. Haston&#x27;s relations with the Labor candidate, D. J. Williams, seem to have been personally harmonious, so much so that later in 1949 Williams was instrumental in finding Haston a job with the National Council of Labour Colleges.

With the turn of the war against the Nazis, the RCP was at pains to look for any signs of the coming revolutionary upheavals that were expected in line with the perspectives of the Fourth International as outlined in the famous Transitional Program. The leading theoretician of the RCP, Ted Grant, was therefore far seeing when he sought to tailor the political demands of the movement to the actual movement rather than succumbing to a rosy view of events. This realistic view of events was also prompted by the agreement of the RCP leadership with the documents of the Goldman-Morrow-Heijenoort minority in the American Socialist Workers Party.

== Fourth International==
In 1946 Haston led a delegation of the RCP to a conference of some of the sections of the Fourth International (FI) in Paris; he considered the conference as a congress of the movement. This was motivated in part by the opposition of the RCP to the demoralisation of the German comrades of the International Communists of Germany (IKD).

Haston and Bill Hunter proposed amendments to the resolutions that the FI&#x27;s leadership put forward at the meeting. In contrast to the FI leadership, the amendments argued that Stalinism had emerged from the war strengthened, and that an economic crisis was unlikely in the near future. Therefore, it was argued, political demands and expectations had to recognise these changes, and not pose revolutionary tasks in the absence of a revolutionary situation. However, the FI majority around Ernest Mandel and Michel Pablo, backed by the Socialist Workers Party in the United States, prevailed and the amendnments were rejected.

The dispute with the leadership of the FI deepened with time, and came to be centred on three interlinked questions. First, the RCP&#x27;s position on the role of Stalinism in Eastern Europe was different from the FI&#x27;s: in particular, when the latter began to support Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia against the USSR the RCP became very critical. This criticism was expressed in documents written by Haston. Second, there was the question of economic perspectives and the growing tendency of the Labour government of Clement Attlee to take various industries into state ownership, as was also happening in eastern Europe. Again, it was Haston who, in the pages of &quot;Socialist Appeal&quot;, opposed the idea that state ownership could be equated with any form of socialism. A complementary document on more general economic perspectives was written for the RCP by Tony Cliff, who later acknowledged that he had been greatly influenced by Haston in this period. Finally, there was the question of whether or not the RCP should enter the Labour Party as a body. Haston opposed this idea. In 1947, however, an FI-sponsored minority led by Gerry Healy was granted permission by the FI to join the Labour Party, against the democratically decided views of the RCP.

Under pressure from the FI the RCP dissolved itself in 1949. Most of its former members, including Haston, joined Healy in &quot;The Club&quot;. Haston, demoralised by the problems that Trotskyism had been undergoing in Britain since the end of the war, resigned from the movement in February 1950. He remained active in the Labour Party for the rest of his life, becoming a lecturer for the National Council of Labour Colleges and then educational director for the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EEPTU).

<text>Adalberon, or Ascelin (died 19 July 1030/1031), was a French bishop and poet. He was a son of Reginar of Bastogne, and a nephew of Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims.

He studied at Reims and was in the chapter of Metz Cathedral. He became bishop of Laon in 977.

The chronicler Richer of Rheims reports an accusation of 977 against him of adultery, with Queen Emma of Italy. Emma&#x27;s son Louis V of France removed him from Laon in 981.

When Laon was taken by Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, in 988, Adalberon was put into prison, whence he escaped and sought the protection of Hugh Capet, king of France. Winning the confidence of Charles of Lorraine and of Arnulf, archbishop of Reims, he was restored to his see; but in 991 he gave Laon, together with Charles and Arnulf, into the hands of Hugh Capet.

Subsequently, he took an active part in ecclesiastical affairs, and died on July 19, 1030/1031.

==Works==
Adalberon wrote a satirical poem, &quot;Carmen ad Rotbertum regem&quot;, in the form of a dialogue dedicated to Robert II of France, in which he argued against contemporary episcopal and monastic reform (such as the Cluniac Reforms). He showed his dislike of Odilo, Abbot of Cluny, and his followers, and his objection to persons of humble birth being made bishops. Versions include:

*Valois, H. (ed.). &quot;Carmen panegyricum in laudem Berengarii&quot;. Paris, 1663. First (modern) publication of the poem.
He seems to be famous in French history because of a poem in which he made mention of (the) three orders in society : &quot;oratores, bellatores, laboratores&quot; : the clergy (&quot;praying Church&quot;), nobles and chivalry (&quot;the fighting church&quot;), and, third, the labouring people (&quot;church of toiling&quot;), the last one supporting the others, and all supporting the whole edifice of mankind. This idea was incorporated into the &quot;three social orders&quot; of the Ancien Régime in France.

<text>The Dan Hodge Trophy is awarded each year to the United States of America’s best college wrestler. The trophy is presented at the end of the season by &quot;WIN&quot; magazine and Culture House. It is the collegiate wrestling equivalent to the Heisman Trophy in college football. Its high school wrestling equivalent is the Junior Hodge Trophy, which has been awarded annually since 1998. 

The Hodge Trophy is named after Danny Hodge, a three–time NCAA champion for the University of Oklahoma from 1955 to 1957. The Hodge Trophy was created by Mike Chapman, founder of WIN magazine and Culture House, a company that produces books and posters. The first winner was T.J. Jaworsky, a three–time NCAA Division I National champion from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1995.

There have been six multiple winners of the Hodge Trophy. The first was Iowa State&#x27;s legend Cael Sanderson, who won the award three times in his run as the first undefeated four–time NCAA champion, the second was Ben Askren from Missouri, who won the award two times, the third and fourth were David Taylor and Zain Retherford respectively, both from Penn State, who won the award two times, the fifth is Spencer Lee from Iowa, and the sixth (and most recent) is Gable Steveson, who won the award two times, becoming the only heavyweight to do so.

==Award criteria==
Since 2022, the Hodge Trophy Voting Criteria has been based on four criteria:

# Record
# Dominance/Bonus-Point Percentage
# Quality of Competition
# Sportsmanship

Formerly, the trophy was awarded based on seven criteria:

# Record
# Number of pins
# Dominance
# Past credentials
# Quality of competition
# Sportsmanship/Citizenship
# Heart

<doc id="638030" wikidata="Q242832" url="?curid=638030" title="Lothair of France">
<text>Lothair (; ; 941 – 2 March 986), sometimes called Lothair II, III or IV, was the penultimate Carolingian king of West Francia, reigning from 10 September 954 until his death in 986.

==Accession==
Lothair was born in Laon near the end of 941, as the eldest son of King Louis IV and Gerberga of Saxony. He succeeded his father on 10 September 954 at the age of thirteen and was crowned at the Abbey of Saint-Remi by Artald of Reims, Archbishop of Reims on 12 November 954. Lothair had already been associated with the throne since the illness of his father in 951, this being a custom in the royal succession since the founding of the Kingdom of the Franks by the Merovingian dynasty.

Queen Gerberga made an arrangement with her brother-in-law Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks and Count of Paris, who had been an adversary of Lothair&#x27;s father. In exchange for supporting Lothair&#x27;s rule Hugh was given rule over Duchy of Aquitaine and much of the Kingdom of Burgundy as more or less a regent. Lothair inherited a fragmented kingdom, where the great magnates took lands, rights and offices almost without any regard for the authority of the king. Magnates like Hugh the Great and Herbert II, Count of Vermandois were always a veiled threat.

In 955 Lothair and Hugh the Great together took Poitiers by siege. With Hugh the Great&#x27;s death in 956 Lothair, only fifteen, came under the guardianship of his maternal uncle Bruno, archbishop of Cologne, brother of East Francia&#x27;s king Otto I. With Bruno&#x27;s advice, Lothair mediated between Hugh&#x27;s sons – Hugh Capet and Otto, Duke of Burgundy. The King gave Paris and the title of &quot;dux francorum&quot; (Duke of the Franks) to Hugh Capet, and invested Otto with the Duchy of Burgundy in 956.

==Worsening relations with the Holy Roman Empire==
The guardianship of Archbishop Bruno of Cologne lasted until 965 and oriented Lothair towards policy of submission towards East Francia, which was evolving into the German Holy Roman Empire. Despite his youth, Lothair wanted to rule alone and reinforced his authority over his vassals. This desire of political independence led to a deterioration in relations between the King and his maternal relatives and a struggle with the new Holy Roman Empire. Despite this, Lothair wanted to maintain ties with Emperor Otto I by marrying Princess Emma of Italy (the only daughter of Empress Adelaide of Burgundy – second wife of Otto I, from her first marriage with King Lothair II, member of the Bosonids dynasty) in early 966.

In 962 Baldwin III, Count of Flanders, son, co-ruler, and heir of Arnulf I, Count of Flanders died and Arnulf bequeathed Flanders to Lothair. On Arnulf&#x27;s death in 965, Lothair invaded Flanders and took many cities, but was eventually repulsed by the supporters of Arnulf II, Count of Flanders. He temporarily remained in control of Arras and Douai. Lothair attempted to increase his influence in the Lotharingia, once held by his family, and in turn Emperor Otto II encouraged resistance to Lothair&#x27;s overtures.

In 976 the brothers Reginar IV, Count of Mons and Lambert I, Count of Louvain, after being dispossessed from their paternal inheritance by Emperor Otto II, made an alliance with Charles (King Lothair&#x27;s younger brother) and Otto, Count of Vermandois and with an army they marched against the Imperial troops. A great battle, which remained undecided, took place in Mons. Although Lothair secretly encouraged this war, he did not intervene directly to help his brother.

Charles took advantage of the situation and established himself in Lotharingia. His main interest was to break the harmony between Lothair and the House of Ardennes, loyal to Emperor Otto II and very powerful in Lotharingia and to which belonged both the Chancellor-Arbishop Adalberon of Reims and his namesake Bishop Adalberon of Laon.

In 977, Charles accused Queen Emma of adultery with Bishop Adalberon of Laon. The Synod of Sainte-Macre, led by Archbishop Adalberon of Reims, took place in Fismes to discuss the matter. Due to a lack of evidence, both the Queen and Bishop were absolved, but Charles, who maintained the rumors, was expelled from the kingdom by Lothair. The House of Ardennes and the Lotharingian party, who were favorable to an agreement with Otto II, seemed all-powerful at the court of Lothair.

Otto II, however, committed the mistakes of restoring the County of Hainaut to Reginar IV and Lambert I, and of appointing Charles as Duke of Lower Lorraine, a region corresponding to the northern half of Lotharingia, separate from the Upper Lotharingia since the late 950. Rewarding Charles, who had questioned the honor of the wife of the King of the Franks, was a way to offend the King himself.

==War with the Holy Roman Empire==

In August 978 Lothair mounted an expedition into Lorraine accompanied by Hugh Capet and upon their crossing the Meuse river took Aachen, but did not capture Otto II or Charles. Lothair then sacked the imperial Palace of Aachen for three days, and reversed the direction of the bronze eagle of Charlemagne to face east instead of west.

In retaliation Otto II, accompanied by Charles, invaded West Francia in October 978 and ravaged Reims, Soissons (where he stopped at the Abbey of St. Medard, Soissons for devotions) and Laon. Lothair was able to escape from the Imperial troops, but Charles was proclaimed King of the Franks in Laon by Bishop Dietrich I of Metz, a relative of Emperor Otto I. The Imperial army advanced to Paris, where they faced Hugh Capet&#x27;s army. On 30 November 978, Otto II and Charles, unable to take Paris, lifted their siege of the city and turned back. The Frankish royal army led by Lothair pursued and defeated them while crossing the river Aisne and being able to recover Laon, forcing Otto II to flee and take refuge in Aachen with Charles, the puppet-King he wanted to impose on West Francia.

In West Francia the hasty retreat of Emperor Otto II had a considerable impact and long after was evoked as a great victory of Lothair. Thus, written in 1015, the Chronicles of Sens gives an epic description: there Lothair was exalted as a warrior-king who pursued the German Emperor to the heart of Lorraine, destroying on the banks of the Argonne a great multitude of enemies, then returned to the Kingdom of the Franks covered with glory. The chronicler say: &quot;&quot;As for the Emperor Otto, followed by those of his people who were able to escape, he returned to his country in the greatest confusion; after which neither he nor his army ever returned to France&quot;. Contemporary documents speak of the event with the same triumphal accents: written after the retirement of Otto II, a diploma of the Abbey of Marmoutier near Tours dated during the reign &quot;of the great King Lothair, in his twenty-sixth year&quot; (of rule; although apparently wrong), &quot; in which he attacked the Saxon and forced the Emperor to escape&quot; &quot;. These retrospectives were observed by some historians such as Karl Ferdinand Werner as one of the first manifestations of national feeling.

==Reconciliation with the Holy Roman Empire==

The unity of Western Franks against Otto II had the consequence of placing the dynasty of Robertians in a prominent place in the person of Hugh Capet, whose contemporaries attested that he faithfully served king Lothair. The fight with the Emperor strengthened the power of Hugh Capet, which was shown in 980 when he captured Montreuil-sur-Mer from Arnulf II, Count of Flanders.

Lothair wanted to thwart the ambitions of his exiled brother Charles, and decided to follow his father&#x27;s steps to secure the succession for his own son. On 8 June 979 Prince Louis was crowned as associated ruler or Junior King (&quot;iunior rex&quot;) – although he did not actually assume power until Lothair&#x27;s death in 986 – being the second time of this new practice in the kingdom of West Francia, which later was adapted by the Capetians.

After this, Lothair began to approach the Holy Roman Empire. The Bishops of Reims and Laon, with the House of Ardennes, supported this rapprochement. In July 980 Lothair and Otto II met at Margut-sur-Chiers on the Frankish border, and concluded a peace treaty. As a part of the agreement, Lothair renounced his rights to Lotharingia, allowing Otto II to turn his military attention to the Byzantine Italy, which he wanted to conquer. This peace was perceived negatively by the Robertians, who were excluded from the negotiations. The Peace of Margut led the Frankish kingdom to be included in the Ottonian orbit, and consequently weakened the influence of the Robertians within the royal government in favor of the Lotharingian nobility. Afraid of being caught between the Carolingian and Ottonian kings, Hugh Capet went to Rome in 981 to contact with Otto II in order to establish his own alliance. Lothair then gave instructions for his capture once he returned.

==Marriage of the heir==

To counter the power of Hugh Capet as Duke of the Franks, Lothair – following the advice of his wife Emma and Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou – decided to marry his son and heir Louis to Adelaide-Blanche of Anjou, Geoffrey I&#x27;s sister and the widow of two powerful southern lords, Count Stephen of Gévaudan and Count Raymond of Toulouse, Prince of Gothia. The project of Lothair was ambitious: the restoration of the royal Carolingian presence in the semi-independent south of West Francia, and – according to Richerus – to gain support of southern nobles in his fight against the Robertians.

The wedding between Adelaide-Blanche and Prince Louis took place in 982 at Vieille-Brioude, Haute-Loire, and they both were immediately crowned King and Queen of Aquitaine by Adelaide&#x27;s brother Bishop Guy of le Puy. However, soon the noticeable age difference between them – Louis was fifteen while Adelaide was a forty-year-old woman – and Louis&#x27; debauched lifestyle caused the end of the marriage in 984, with Lothair supporting his son while Adelaide took refuge with Count William I of Provence, who soon became her fourth husband.

However, the existence of the marriage, despite being recorded by relative contemporary and later sources (Richerus, Rodulfus Glaber, the &quot;Chronicon Andegavensi&quot; and the Chronicle of Saint-Maxence, among others), was recently challenged by historian Carlrichard Brülh.

The failure of the alliance with the House of Anjou reinforced the power of the Robertians, and finally they supported Hugh Capet against Charles of Lower Lorraine in 987.

Emerging from the crisis in Aquitaine, Lothair counted on the loyalty of ten powerful northern bishops of the kingdom and their vassals, and the alliance with the powerful House of Vermandois in the person of Herbert III, Count of Vermandois, his nephew – as son of his half-sister Gerberge of Lorraine. But Herbert III was relatively old and the bishops who had served his father Louis IV were more inclined towards spiritual tasks than to the defense of royal interests. Lothair lacked the ability to implement any large project of conquest consistent with the previous Frankish tradition and to mobilize the aristocracy around him.

==Attempt to recover Lotharingia==

Emperor Otto II suddenly died on 7 December 983, leaving as heir his three-year-old son Otto III. Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, as the nearest Ottonian relative, obtained the regency of the kingdom without much opposition and abducted Otto III in hopes of being proclaimed king himself. Adalberon of Reims, eager to support Otto III and his mother Empress Theophanu, tried to convince Lothair to support the Empress against the Duke of Bavaria. In the name of Theophanu, Adalberon offered Lothair the recovery of Lotharingia. Shortly after Lothair formally claimed the guardianship of his infant nephew Otto III and the custody of the Lotharingia. Thanks to Adalberon, Lothair obtained the homage of several major Lotharingian nobles including Godfrey I, Count of Verdun, a member of the House of Ardennes. In addition, he reconciled with his brother Charles, who hoped to obtain the Upper Lorraine (at that time ruled by a regent, Beatrix, widow of Frederick I, Duke of Upper Lorraine and sister of Hugh Capet). Lothair then hoped to receive the full sovereignty over Lotharingia. Nevertheless, the quick failure of Henry II&#x27;s plans foiled the project: by mid-984 Empress Theophanu and Archbishop Willingis of Mainz were able to rescue Otto III and to regain control over Empire. The subsequent peace concluded at Worms between Henry II and Theophanu reaffirmed the end of the Carolingian pretensions over Lotharingia and the triumph of the House of Ardennes, which strengthened its control there.

Lothair refused to renounce the land which he considered rightfully belonging to him: he decided to make an alliance with Henry II, and on 1 February 985 their combined forces arrived to the banks of the Rhine in Brissach. This alliance worried Adalberon of Reims, who contacted Hugh Capet. Henry II did not keep his alliance with Lothair, so the king decided to advance to the Lotharingia alone. At first, he tried to obtain the support of Hugh Capet, but he refused to overthrow his sister and nephew; however, he did not support either party clearly, favoring the Ottonian hegemony. Finally, Lothair obtained the support of the most powerful Counts of the kingdom, Odo I, Count of Blois and Herbert III, Count of Meaux. Shortly thereafter, they invaded Upper Lotharingia, besieged Verdun and, by March of 985, had captured several important prisoners: Godfrey I of Verdun (brother of Adalberon) and his son Frederick, Sigfried, Count of the Ardennes (uncle of Godfrey I) and Theodoric I, Duke of Upper Lorraine (nephew of Hugh Capet).

After returning to Laon, Lothair forced Adalberon to build a fortress in Verdun to prevent the city from being taken by the Imperial forces. He also forced him to write to the Archbishops of Egbert of Trier, Willigis of Mainz and Ebergar of Cologne, stating that he, Lothair, was the true and only heir of the Carolingian Empire.

==Open conflict with the House of Ardennes==

When the caliph of Córdoba, Al-Mansur, sacked Barcelona in 985, Lothair was ill and could offer no assistance to Borrell II, Count of Barcelona, who had sent envoys to Verdun. This contributed to the final split between the Hispanic March and the Frankish crown during the reign of his successors.

At this point Lothair&#x27;s power seemed markedly less than that of Hugh Capet. In a letter Gerbert of Aurillac wrote to the Archbishop Adalbero that &quot;Lothair is king of France in name alone; Hugh is, however, not in name but in effect and deed.&quot; Not long after, Archbishop Adalberon began openly pressing pro-Ottonian views and tried to influence Hugh Capet into relations with Otto III. When the King ordered the destruction of the fortifications that surrounded the monastery of Saint-Paul in Verdun, Adalberon refused on the grounds that his hungry soldiers no longer were able to keep the city. Furious, Lothair wanted to bring Adalberon to justice. On 11 May 986, Adalberon was summoned to an assembly at Compiègne under false pretences (among them, that he placed his nephew and namesake Adalberon in the bishopric seat of Verdun without royal consent) and charged the surprised archbishop with treason. Alerted, Hugh Capet marched on Compiègne with 6,000 men and dispersed the meeting before a verdict could be reached. Some historians believe that the intervention of Hugh Capet was less motivated by the defence of Adalberon than to obtain the release of his nephew, the young Duke Theodoric I of Upper Lorraine. Lothair could have intended to strengthen his stranglehold on Verdun and its region by forcing Adalberon to pursue his nephew Adalberon of Verdun, son of Count Godfrey I.

Lothair could not afford an open war against Hugh Capet because he would end up caught between two fronts. He then released his Lorraine prisoners, but Godfrey I chose to stay in prison rather than surrender Mons, in Hainaut, and force his son to give up all claims over the County and the Bishopric of Verdun. In the meanwhile, following a meeting between the King and the Duke of the Franks, Theodoric I of Upper Lorraine was released.

==New projects and sudden death==

In early 986 Lothair intended to attack Cambrai, an imperial city but one dependent on the Archbishoprics of Reims and Liège; he thought that he could convince Bishop Rothard to surrender the city in exchange for his appointment as Archbishop of Rheims (following the deposition of Adalberon) and Prince-Bishop of Liège (whose Prince-Bishop Notger finally escaped to Ottonian territory); but the King suddenly died at Laon on 2 March 986. He received a magnificent funeral and was buried next to his father Louis IV in the choir of Saint-Remi of Reims.

One year after the change of dynasty, Lothair&#x27;s kingdom seemed indestructible because, even if Lotharingia had not submitted, the inertia of the Empire could let him consider new conquests. According to Richerus: &quot;He was looking for new advantages that could further extend his kingdom. His policy was very successful, and the condition of the Kingdom, favored by the capture of the great nobles, was strong.&quot; In fact, in his last years, Lothar deployed both diplomatically and militarily exceptional activity intending to conquer Lotharingia.

==Family==
With his wife Emma of Italy, Lothair had two sons:
* Louis V (966/967 – 22 May 987), successor of his father as king.
* Otto (c. 970 – 13 November bef. 986), canon of Rheims.

Lothair also had two illegitimate sons with a sister of certain Count Robert, Mayor of the Palace of his brother Charles:
* Arnulf (bef. 967 – 5 March 1021), archbishop of Reims.
* Richard (d. aft. 991).

<doc id="638032" wikidata="Q331790" url="?curid=638032" title="Interpol (band)">
<text>Interpol is an American rock band from Manhattan, New York. Formed in 1997, their original line-up consisted of Paul Banks (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Daniel Kessler (lead guitar, backing vocals), Carlos Dengler (bass guitar, keyboards), and Greg Drudy (drums). Drudy left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Sam Fogarino. Dengler left to pursue other projects in 2010, with Banks taking on the additional role of bassist instead of hiring a new one.

Having first performed at Luna Lounge alongside peers such as the Strokes, Longwave, the National, and Stellastarr, Interpol is one of the bands associated with the New York indie music scene and one of several groups that emerged from the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band&#x27;s sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar with a snare-heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Television and the Chameleons, and also to Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The band has no primary songwriter, with each member contributing to composition.

Interpol&#x27;s first full-length album &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; (2002) was critically acclaimed, making it to No. 10 on &quot;NME&quot; list of the top albums of the year and No. 1 on Pitchfork Media&#x27;s list of the top 50 albums of the year. Subsequent records &quot;Antics&quot; (2004) and &quot;Our Love to Admire&quot; (2007) brought greater critical and commercial success. The band released its fourth full-length album, &quot;Interpol&quot;, in September 2010, then went on hiatus while they focused on other projects. Their fifth studio album, &quot;El Pintor&quot;, was released in September 2014. The band embarked on an anniversary tour for &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; in 2017, performing the album live in its entirety. The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Marauder&quot;, was released in August 2018, and their seventh, &quot;The Other Side of Make-Believe&quot;, in July 2022.

==History==
===Formation and early releases (1997–2001)===
The band was formed by Kessler and Drudy. Kessler had &quot;been looking to put a band together for a while&quot; when he met Drudy. Kessler &quot;had a very hard time finding musicians to play with—musicians at all, really.&quot; Kessler met Dengler in a philosophy class at New York University and asked him if he played an instrument. Later, Kessler ran into Banks (whom he had first met in France) in New York City&#x27;s East Village, and the pair discussed collaborating. Banks admitted that he and Dengler &quot;butted heads&quot; early on in the band&#x27;s history, but told &quot;Spin&quot; that now the two are &quot;really tight, in a spiritual way&quot;. The band had trouble choosing a name at first. &quot;I got to the point where I was like, &#x27;Guys, we&#x27;re getting decent crowds, but like... we don&#x27;t have a name so no one knows who to go see again,&#x27;&quot; Kessler said. Furthermore, the band considered the names Las Armas and The French Letters before adopting Interpol.

In 2000, after releasing the &quot;Fukd ID No. 3&quot; extended-play album, Drudy left the band to focus on Hot Cross and his label Level Plane Records. Kessler recruited Fogarino, who worked at a local vintage clothing store and at the time considered retiring from music, to replace Drudy. While a member of Interpol, Drudy was also a member of seminal first-wave screamo act Saetia.

===Signing with Matador Records, &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; and &quot;Antics&quot; (2002–2005)===

After self-releasing several EPs between 1998 and 2001, the band signed with Matador Records, a member of the independent Beggars Group, in early 2002. The first release, an EP titled simply &quot;Interpol&quot;, containing re-recorded versions of &quot;PDA&quot; and &quot;NYC&quot;, was released in June 2002. &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; was released on August 19, 2002. Recorded at Tarquin Studios in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the album&#x27;s sound drew comparisons to post-punk groups of the early 1980s and late 1970s, particularly Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen and the Smiths. The record was a slow-building success, selling 300,000 copies by 2004.

The band regrouped in late 2003 to begin sessions for the follow-up album, again decamping to Tarquin Studios to record. The band released its second album &quot;Antics&quot; on September 27, 2004. The album sold 350,000 copies in its first four months of release. The record also saw the band earn its first UK Top 40 hits with &quot;Slow Hands&quot;, &quot;Evil&quot; and &quot;C&#x27;mere&quot; charting at No. 36, No. 18 and No. 19, respectively. The album eventually reached Gold status in the UK, and later in the US.

The band toured again after the release of the album, playing more dates than ever before and at bigger venues. The &quot;Antics&quot; tour stretched on for almost 18 months, including playing as undercards for U2 and the Cure, and the band expressed feelings of exhaustion to BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe at a concert in Sunderland. The band took three months off after touring finished. Whilst on the road, the band had also released the one-off track &quot;Direction&quot;, written for the official soundtrack to HBO&#x27;s &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends&quot;.

===Move to Capitol Records and &quot;Our Love to Admire&quot; (2006–2008)===

In late March 2006, Fogarino confirmed that the band were back in the studio working on new material. In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Fogarino stated &quot;[the process is] moving right along where I think it should...we&#x27;re all pretty much on fire about it&quot;. Fogarino also dispelled rumors that the band had signed to major label Interscope, but also confirmed that they would be leaving Matador in search of a new label. An update to their website in June confirmed that the band had been working on the follow-up since the turn of the year, but did not confirm a name for the album or comment on the mounting speculation that they were imminently to sign to a major label. On August 14, it was widely reported that Interpol had signed for Capitol Records, a fact confirmed by Matador on September 1 in a press release on their website.

&quot;Our Love to Admire&quot; was released in July 2007. The album represents a departure for the band, being both the first record they have recorded in New York City (at The Magic Shop and Electric Lady Studios), and the first time they have included keyboards in the arrangements from the start of the songwriting process. The band intended to tour behind the album extensively, beginning with the summer festival circuit throughout the United States and Europe. In August, Interpol headlined one of the days of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago.
===Return to Matador, &quot;Interpol&quot; and departure of Carlos Dengler (2009–2011)===

On March 6, 2009, the band announced on its website that it was working on songs for a fourth album. The album was recorded in Electric Lady Studios during spring 2009. In an interview, Fogarino referred to the album as having gone back to the original sound of &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot;. It was later claimed by Banks that it would not sound anything like their debut album and that there is some very &quot;classical stuff going on&quot; with it. No news about the album surfaced until late April when the band sent an email directing users to a free download of &quot;Lights&quot;, the first officially released song. Citing management changes at the label, the band left Capitol Records prior to the album&#x27;s release, signing again with Matador Records. On June 22, 2010, a promotional video for &quot;Lights&quot;, directed by Charlie White and featuring Lola Blanc, was made available for free download on the band&#x27;s official website.

The band&#x27;s fourth album (self-titled) was officially released on September 7, 2010. It was Dengler&#x27;s last effort with Interpol. In an announcement on the band&#x27;s website on May 9, 2010, it was revealed that he had left the band sometime after the album&#x27;s completion. When the remaining members toured in support, he was replaced by multiple players, including David Pajo (formerly of Slint and many other bands) on bass, and Brandon Curtis of The Secret Machines on keyboards and vocals. The album was released on Matador Records in the US, and on Cooperative Music for Europe, Australia and Japan. In February 2011, Pajo announced that he was no longer touring with Interpol, in order to dedicate more time to his family. Pajo was subsequently replaced by Brad Truax.

The band was announced as the opener for the third and fourth legs of U2&#x27;s 360° Tour, and subsequently the band announced eighteen US shows to take place over the third leg of U2&#x27;s 360° Tour, but only three of them went ahead after Bono&#x27;s back injury cancelled U2&#x27;s entire third leg. The band toured the UK and Ireland in November and December 2010. The band opened for U2 on their rescheduled tour date at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois, on July 5, 2011, and remained on U2&#x27;s 360° Tour for the remainder of the summer.

=== Brief hiatus and &quot;El Pintor&quot; (2012–2015) ===

After the band&#x27;s appearance at Reading and Leeds in 2011, Fogarino was interviewed. He said, &quot;[w]e need a big break. Interpol needs it. We need to recoup and go on a proper hiatus.&quot; He stated that the remaining members of the band would be pursuing separate projects, one of which included a second solo album by Paul Banks. A deluxe edition of the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights&quot; was released on December 4, 2012, to mark the album&#x27;s ten-year anniversary. It includes previously hard-to-find tracks, including &quot;Get The Girls&quot; and &quot;Cubed&quot;.

The band announced on June 5, 2014, that their fifth studio album, entitled &quot;El Pintor&quot;, would be released on September 9, 2014. This album&#x27;s name was derived as an anagram by Paul Banks who created the name while thinking of new design concepts for merchandise. It was the band&#x27;s first album since the departure of bassist Carlos Dengler, with Paul Banks taking over bass duties for the first time as well as touring member Brandon Curtis taking over keyboard duties on nine of the ten album tracks.

To promote the album, Interpol embarked a world tour which started in June 2014. While on tour in November, the band were one of the many caught in the heavy snow storms in Buffalo, New York. The band&#x27;s tour bus was unable to move and they were stuck under the snow for more than 50 hours. Three shows, two in Canada and one in Boston, were postponed as a result. Touring for &quot;El Pintor&quot; culminated in a performance at the 2015 Electric Picnic festival.

&quot;El Pintor&quot; was followed up by a remix album, &quot;El Pintor Remixes&quot;, which featured electronic musicians such as Panda Bear, Factory Floor and The Field.

=== &quot;Marauder&quot; and &quot;A Fine Mess&quot; (2016–2019) ===

In September 2016, Paul Banks revealed in an interview on Beats 1 that Interpol would resume writing in the fall. In January 2017, Interpol announced that their sixth album would be out in 2018 and that they would embark on a tour for &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&#x27; &quot; 15th anniversary, playing the entire album front to back. In between the tour and announcement of the new album, they released an EP consisting of bonus tracks from &quot;El Pintor&quot;. The tracks included were &quot;The Depths&quot;, &quot;Malfeasance&quot;, and &quot;What Is What&quot;.

On May 24, 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted that the name of the new album would be &quot;Marauder&quot; in their Guide to New Albums: Summer 2018 list. In June 2018, the band held a press conference in Mexico City and announced the &quot;Marauder&quot; release date, August 24, 2018. The same day they released the first single of the album entitled &quot;The Rover&quot;. A month later Interpol released their second single from the album, &quot;Number 10&quot;. On August 23, the music video for their single &quot;If You Really Love Nothing&quot; was released.

On January 30, 2019, Interpol released &quot;Fine Mess&quot;, a song that was left off of &quot;Marauder&quot;, as a single. On March 28, the band announced a new EP, &quot;A Fine Mess&quot;, consisting of songs from the &quot;Marauder&quot; sessions that didn&#x27;t make the final cut, with a release date of May 17, 2019. On the same day, they released the second single off the EP, &quot;The Weekend&quot;. On August 16, 2019, &quot;Our Love to Admire&quot; became unavailable on streaming platforms which caused some panic among fans. Lead singer Paul Banks quickly addressed the issue by reassuring fans via Twitter that the album would be returned to streaming platforms. On December 10, 2020, it was announced that Matador Records had finally acquired the rights to Interpol&#x27;s entire catalog.

=== &quot;The Other Side of Make-Believe&quot; (2020–present) ===

Interpol began writing songs for a seventh studio album during the summer of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the way they wrote music; the band wrote in an Instagram post that they, at first, &quot;had to use the internet to circulate ideas and collaborate remotely&quot; before eventually being able to write music together in person at a house in the Catskill Mountains. They began recording the album in London during 2021 alongside producers Flood and Alan Moulder, the latter of whom previously mixed &quot;Interpol&quot; (2010) and &quot;El Pintor&quot; (2014). The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Toni&quot; premiered on April 7. The album is titled &quot;The Other Side of Make-Believe&quot; and was released on July 15, 2022, along with a music video for &quot;Gran Hotel&quot;.

On April 20, 2024, Interpol performed a free concert at the Zócalo in Mexico City to an estimated crowd of 160,000, the largest show of the band&#x27;s career.

==Side projects==
In early 2007, Fogarino joined with former Swervedriver frontman Adam Franklin to form a side-project band called The Setting Suns. Since then, the duo have changed their name to Magnetic Morning and released a six-track EP on iTunes.

On August 4, 2009, Banks released his first solo record titled &quot;Julian Plenti is... Skyscraper&quot; under the assumed name Julian Plenti. Although not a long departure from Interpol&#x27;s sound, the album features a wider range of material, and &quot;establishes Banks&#x27; viability as a musician outside of the context of Interpol&quot;. The album was recorded at the Seaside Lounge in Brooklyn and at Electric Lady Studios in Manhattan. It was mixed by Peter Katis at Tarquin Studios in Connecticut. The album was released on Matador Records. He released his second solo album, &quot;Banks&quot;, on October 22, 2012, under his own name.

In 2013, Fogarino, touring Interpol member Brandon Curtis, and Duane Denison formed EmptyMansions, who released their album &quot;snakes/vultures/sulfate&quot; via Riot House Records in April 2013.

In 2014, Daniel Kessler formed Big Noble with sound designer Joseph Fraioli of Datach&#x27;i. They released their debut album &quot;First Light&quot; on February 2, 2015.

In 2016, Paul Banks released an album alongside Wu-Tang Clan member RZA under the name Banks &amp; Steelz. The album, titled &quot;Anything But Words&quot;, was released on August 26, 2016, through Warner Bros. Records.

In 2020, Paul Banks announced a new side project by the name of Muzz. The band also consists of Josh Kaufman and Matt Barrick. Their self-titled debut LP, &quot;Muzz&quot; was released on June 5, 2020, through Matador Records.

Research and analysis into the causes and extent of fuel poverty and the development of policies which will address the problem.

Providing advice and guidance to installers on good practice in delivering energy efficiency services to low-income householders.

Developing national qualifications and managing their implementation to improve standards of practical work and the quality of energy advice.

Producing educational resources to teach people about the importance of energy efficiency.

Managing demonstration projects in inner cities and rural areas which show innovative ways of tackling fuel poverty and bring the wider benefits of energy efficiency to local communities.

The definition of affordable warmth in affordable warmth schemes is where a household can achieve temperatures needed to maintain health and comfort for expenditure of less than 10% of income. This definition has been accepted and used by successive Government Departments with responsibilities for fuel poverty issues to quantify the extent of the problem. However, there has been some disagreement over what constitutes household income and this clearly has considerable bearing on the total number of fuel-poor households.

The Government&#x27;s preferred definition of household income includes Housing Benefit and Income Support for Mortgage Interest in the calculation of household resources, although fuel poverty estimates are also published using a formula that excludes housing subsidies.

NEA&#x27;s view is that neither of these definitions is acceptable or rational and that the only sensible definition of income is one that uses actual disposable income after housing costs.

Fuel poverty results from a combination of low household income, unaffordable energy costs and inadequate thermal insulation and inefficient and uneconomic heating systems. Welfare benefit increases for vulnerable groups, and other initiatives such as the minimum wage, have addressed some aspects of general poverty and fuel poverty, this approach must be considered short term in the context of fuel poverty. NEA maintains that energy efficiency is the only rational solution to fuel poverty and that Government should direct.

<text>The Tulane University School of Medicine is the medical school of Tulane University and is located in the Medical District of the New Orleans Central Business District in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.

==History==

The school was founded in 1834 as the Medical College of Louisiana and is the fifteenth oldest medical school in the United States and the second oldest in the deep south. The first classes were held in 1835 at a variety of locations, including Charity Hospital and the Strangers Unitarian Church.

===Late 1800s to present===
The first permanent building for the school was constructed in the French Quarter in 1844. In 1893, the school moved to Canal Street in the Richardson building, and then shortly after to the Hutchison Building, also on Canal. Finally, in 1930, the school moved to its current location—the Hutchinson Memorial Building—on Tulane Avenue, next to Charity Hospital.

In 2007, the school acquired the Murphy Oil Building on S. Robertson by donation. The Murphy building houses the DeBakey Educational Center, a simulation center, a student lounge with gym, and several administrative offices.

The school refused to fill out the U.S. News statistical survey, and so is unranked for both Research and Primary Care by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Admissions and research==
The school has highly competitive admissions, accepting only 175 medical students from more than 12,000 applications. About 40 percent of the students in each class are concurrently enrolled as candidates for the Master of Public Health degree in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. It is estimated that Tulane University has graduated more than 40 percent of all physicians in the U.S. who have earned both M.D. and master of public health degrees.

In 2001, the Tulane Center for Gene Therapy started as the first major center in the U.S. to focus on research using adult stem cells.

Today, the medical school is but one part of the Tulane University Health Sciences Center, which includes the School of Medicine, the Tulane University Hospital and Clinic, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, the University Health Service, the Tulane National Primate Research Center, the U.S.-Japan Biomedical Research Laboratories, and the Tulane/Xavier Center for Bioenvironmental Research. Most components of the Health Sciences Center are located in the heart of New Orleans, in the medical district that comprises Tulane facilities and the LSU/Charity Hospital center just north of the New Orleans Central Business District. It comprises 20 academic departments: Anesthesiology, Biochemistry, Family and Community Medicine, Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Orthopaedics, Otolaryngology, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics, Pharmacology, Physiology, Psychiatry and Neurology, Radiology, Structural and Cellular Biology, Surgery and Urology.

The school periodically hosts social events with the Tulane University Law School and the Freeman School of Business.

On August 31, 2009, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal along with Tulane President Scott Cowen and Louisiana State University System President John V. Lombardi approved a plan to establish both schools as board members for the future $1.1 billion University Medical Center New Orleans. Ground was broken in 2011 and the hospital opened on August 1, 2015. The 446-bed hospital serves as the flagship for Tulane medical students and residents.

==Facilities==
Tulane&#x27;s medical library, The Rudolph Matas Health Sciences Library, is named after the renowned Professor of Surgery at Tulane University Rudolph Matas, despite the journal &quot;Science&quot; stating of Matas that &quot;his colleagues have felt for many years that by consulting him they could extract more information from his encyclopedic mind than they could obtain from a visit to a library.&quot;

The Tulane Center for Advanced Medical Simulation and Team Training gives medical students, residents, practicing physicians, nurses, technicians, first responders and other healthcare providers the opportunity to learn and perfect the latest techniques and best practices for patient care and safety. The Tulane Sim Center features of simulation and meeting space for hands-on training, instruction and skills assessment including an emergency room, intensive care unit, operating room, labor &amp; delivery room, four hospital patient rooms, four office exam rooms, and a nursing station. The Tulane University: Standardized Patient Center through Foundations in Medicine is the first to pilot low-cost virtual reality through Google Cardboard for first-year medical students.

<text>Socialist Alternative (SA, SAlt, or SocAlt) is a political organisation in Australia. Its members have organised numerous campaigns and protests around economic justice, LGBT rights, climate change, racism, refugee rights and more. The organisation also intervenes in the trade union and student union movements. It has branches and student clubs in most major Australian cities and publishes the fortnightly newspaper &quot;Red Flag&quot;.

Socialist Alternative organises the annual Marxism Conference in Melbourne, a public event featuring discussions on radical history, revolutionary theory, and anti-capitalist politics.

In 2018, Socialist Alternative helped to establish the Victorian Socialists, an electoral project to win federal, state, and local council positions for socialist candidates in the state of Victoria.

==History==
Socialist Alternative was established in 1995 by ex-members of the former International Socialist Organisation (ISO) in Melbourne, including Mick Armstrong. Following debates over the orientation of the ISO to the Australian political situation, the members were expelled for arguing that the ISO held &quot;overblown&quot; expectations of the 1990s combined with &quot;a super-inflated estimation&quot; of its capabilities. This was part of the debate internationally within the International Socialist Tendency over the nature of the contemporary political situation and how socialists should respond, with the leading organisation in the Tendency, the British Socialist Workers Party arguing that the 1990s were like &quot;the 1930s in slow motion&quot;. Like in Australia, splits occurred within the IST in other countries, including New Zealand, Greece, Germany, Canada, South Africa and France. In addition to splits, the International Socialist Organization in the United States were expelled from the IST.

Socialist Alternative has links with several other groups previously part of the IST, such as the ISO in America, the Internationalist Workers&#x27; Left in Greece, Socialisme International in France, and Socialist Aotearoa and the International Socialist Organisation in New Zealand. Since 2013, Socialist Alternative has maintained permanent observer status within the United Secretariat of the Fourth International, a worldwide organisation of revolutionary Marxists.

Until 2003, Socialist Alternative was based primarily in Melbourne, when the organisation began establishing branches in other Australian cities following a surge of growth out of the S11 protests against the 2000 World Economic Forum meeting in Melbourne. 

Socialist Alternative was invited to join the Socialist Alliance in 2001. The Alliance grouped the Democratic Socialist Perspective (DSP), the ISO, and other Australian far-left groups and individuals. Socialist Alternative eventually declined to join due to the Socialist Alliance&#x27;s strong emphasis on running in parliamentary elections. Socialist Alternative saw this parliamentary emphasis in the flat political climate as a restriction to building activism on the ground and representing a turn towards reformist politics. Socialist Alternative entered into unity discussions with the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), which had been expelled from the DSP in 2008. This merger proposal prompted the Socialist Alliance to reopen unity discussions with Socialist Alternative. On 28 March 2013, the RSP voted unanimously to merge with Socialist Alternative.

===Elections===
Socialist Alternative maintains that parliamentary elections are not the key to social change. However, it does not reject voting in elections outright and sees elections reflecting the state of mass political consciousness. Therefore, the organisation promotes whom it votes for and whom it believes the left should support during election periods, for example, calling for the left to unite around SYRIZA in the 2012 Greek legislative election.

From 2018 onwards, Socialist Alternative has been engaged in Victorian Socialists. Victorian Socialists started as an electoral alliance with Socialist Alliance and some independent socialists, but in 2020 Socialist Alliance withdrew.

==Campaigns==
Socialist Alternative has been involved in organising within anti-war campaign groups such as the Stop the War Coalition and has participated in demonstrations across the country, including the protests against the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the 2008–2009 war on Gaza, the 2007 APEC Conference, the 2006 G20 Summit, the 2006 war on Lebanon, the wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, and have been involved in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign and solidarity actions with the Arab Spring.

Since 2004, the Socialist Alternative has participated in the Equal Love campaign – the main campaign group that advocates marriage equality in the country. Many Socialist Alternative members have been elected as National Union of Students Queer Officers and have used this position to promote Equal Love and attack the Rudd-Gillard Government for not repealing John Howard&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage. Several Socialist Alternative members are notable for their same-sex marriage activism. Member Roz Ward co-founded the Safe Schools Coalition Australia, the organisation that organised the Safe Schools Program.
In early 2009, Socialist Alternative established Students for Palestine, and supported the group&#x27;s campus activity, including the protests against the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid and helping fundraise for the Viva Palestina 5. In 2011, Socialist Alternative members were among 19 arrested in a Melbourne demonstration targeting Israeli-owned chocolate chain Max Brenner for its donations to the Israeli Defence Forces, as part of the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign supporting Palestinians against the state of Israel. SA has been called anti-Semitic by the Australasian Union of Jewish Students for its rhetoric and protest techniques. SA maintains that Israel does not represent Jews but only claims to do so, and argues that their group takes &quot;a firm stand against all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism&quot;. Some chapters of Students for Palestine have explicitly stated they are &quot;not an anti-racist movement&quot;. 

Socialist Alternative has been involved in the campaign for refugee rights, building campaigns to mobilise opposition to the policies of mandatory detention and offshore processing. In 2002 they built the protests against detention centre at Woomera, which led to a mass break-out of refugees. Since the election of the Rudd-Gillard Labor government in 2007, they have continued to organise and campaign around the issue.

==Membership routine==
Socialist Alternative has branches in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra, Perth, Adelaide and Wollongong – branch members attend weekly meetings. In Melbourne, the group has been based at Victorian Trades Hall. SA advertises public meetings through leafleting on street stalls, campuses, at demonstrations, and through bill posters.

The group also hosts the annual Marxism Conference, a public event featuring discussions on radical history, revolutionary theory and anti-capitalist politics. It is the largest event of its kind in Australia.

===Student activism===
Socialist Alternative maintains student clubs at many universities around Australia, and their political work often emphasises student-based campaigns. The group is involved in organising student protest actions around several issues which often draw national attention, such as a stunt during a 2014 episode of Q&amp;A demonstrating opposition to government plans for increased higher education fees, the large nationwide protests in response to the 2019–20 Australian bushfire crisis, or a protest against former Liberal Party Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Socialist Alternative participates in campus student union elections and the National Union of Students as a faction and claims to be the largest to the left of the National Labor Students. As revolutionary socialists, the group opposes both the Liberal
 and Labor parties. It has come under attack from a range of factions in student politics, including Liberal students, both Left and Right Labor students and claims to have been slandered by the Australasian Union of Jewish Students for its strong support for the Palestinian liberation struggle and consequent opposition to the state of Israel.

Socialist Alternative was deregistered as an official club by the Monash Student Association in September 2014, cutting them off from student union funding. The student association deregistered Socialist Alternative because of accusations that it had discriminated against Jews at one of its campus meetings. Socialist Alternative said Jews were welcome at the pro-Palestinian meeting and the event&#x27;s main speaker was Jewish. It said a particular group of students were denied entry after they refused to sign a petition calling for an end to Israel&#x27;s economic blockade of Gaza, and had attempted to disrupt the meeting. This occurred in the aftermath of a campus meeting held by SA in support of Palestinians struggling against the Israeli military&#x27;s Operation Protective Edge. Socialist Alternative argued that similar meetings took place at other campuses in Australia, at a time when several Australian student unions were passing motions &quot;condemning Israeli war crimes and occupation&quot; and large demonstrations were being held in support of Palestine. Academics around Australia signed an open letter opposing the deregistration of the Monash club as &quot;the most serious attack yet in a nationwide campaign to stifle free speech on university campuses&quot;.

===Trade unionism===
Members of Socialist Alternative who are employed are politically active within the trade union appropriate for their industry. Socialist Alternative&#x27;s members are active in trade unions, including the National Tertiary Education Union, in which lecturer and Socialist Alternative member Liam Ward was elected to the RMIT University Branch Committee as part of a left-wing oppositional ticket that replaced the previously established union leadership in 2010.

Socialist Alternative rejects the practice of forming separate &#x27;red unions&#x27;, arguing that such projects isolate socialists from the organised working class and are premised on a top-down method of artificially substituting a radical union leadership for the rank and file, instead arguing for activists to rebuild rank and file organisation within existing unions irrespective of their conservative leadership. In 2010, Socialist Alternative member and Queensland Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association delegate Duncan Hart organised supporters of same-sex marriage within the union in a rank-and-file challenge against the socially conservative SDA leader Joe de Bruyn.

==Theory==
Though one of Socialist Alternative&#x27;s stated aims is to contribute towards building a revolutionary party that can intervene in – and lead – mass working-class struggles, they do not consider themselves a political party at their current size and influence. Originating in the political tradition of the International Socialist Tendency, Socialist Alternative defend the position that a socialist revolution can only come about through &quot;workers taking control of their workplaces, dismantling existing state institutions (parliaments, courts, the armed forces and police) and replacing them with an entirely new state based on genuinely democratic control by the working class&quot;. Describing itself as a &quot;propaganda group&quot; at its current size, Socialist Alternative attempts to relate to its audience primarily on the level of ideas, rather than seeing itself as a party that can be capable of leading mass struggles. While Socialist Alternative supports existing trade unions as essential components of workers&#x27; struggles, it believes that capitalism can only be successfully overthrown if a revolutionary party is built to challenge the hold of the ALP and the trade union bureaucracy over the working class, in conjunction with similar parties internationally.

In 2012, the Police Federation of Australia demanded that the Victorian Trades Hall Council cancel a Socialist Alternative public forum on &quot;police racism and violence&quot;, as Trades Hall was where the meeting was to take place. The Council complied with the Police Federation&#x27;s request; however, the meeting went ahead after several people turned up for the meeting and occupied the Trades Hall foyer, causing the Police Federation to split from the Council.

Socialist Alternative sees Russia&#x27;s October 1917 Bolshevik revolution as a genuine socialist revolution. However, it asserts that the following &quot;imperialist&quot; attack on the country and the failure of the revolution to spread to Western Europe led to its ultimate defeat by Stalin&#x27;s &quot;counter-revolution&quot;.
==Publications==
From 2009 to 2011, members of the organisation edited the annual online theoretical journal &quot;Marxist Interventions&quot; (MI). The overall aim of MI was to make Australian Marxist writings more readily accessible to audiences.

In 2010, the organisation launched a biannual theoretical journal, &quot;Marxist Left Review&quot;, edited by Sandra Bloodworth. The journal aims to &quot;engage with theoretical and political debates on the Australian and international left&quot;.

<text>Donald Francis Shula ( ; January 4, 1930 – May 4, 2020) was an American professional football player, coach and executive who served as a head coach in the National Football League (NFL) from 1963 to 1995. He played seven seasons as a defensive back in the NFL. For most of his career, Shula was the head coach of the Miami Dolphins.

Shula held his first head coaching position with the Baltimore Colts, whom he coached for seven seasons from 1963 to 1969. With the Colts, he led them to seven consecutive winning seasons, was a three-time AP NFL Coach of the Year (1964, 1967, 1968), and in 1968 led the Colts to a 13–1 record and a win in the 1968 NFL Championship Game over the Cleveland Browns. However, in Super Bowl III and despite being heavy favorites over the 19 1⁄2 point underdog New York Jets, the Colts were defeated in a massive upset by a score of 16–7. After coaching one more season in Baltimore, in 1970 Shula was then hired to be the Miami Dolphins&#x27; next head coach, and would remain with the Dolphins for the next 26 seasons. In 26 seasons with the Dolphins, Shula had only two losing seasons (1976, 1988), while leading the Dolphins to 11 division titles, 5 AFC Championships including three in a row (1971–1973, 1982, 1984), and back-to-back Super Bowl Championships in 1972 and 1973 in Super Bowl VII and Super Bowl VIII. His Super Bowl VII victory, capped off the only undefeated perfect season in NFL history when his Dolphins finished the 1972 season with a perfect 17–0 record, and also won Shula his 4th NFL AP Coach of the Year Award.

Shula was the first head coach to appear in six Super Bowls, five with the Dolphins and one with the Colts. His six Super Bowl appearances rank second among head coaches (behind only Bill Belichick) and he has the most Super Bowl losses at four, tied with Bud Grant, Marv Levy, and Dan Reeves for the most Super Bowl losses, although Grant, Levy, and Reeves went winless in the Super Bowl. He was the first head coach to bring two franchises to the Super Bowl and appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, which he accomplished with the Dolphins from 1971 to 1973. Having guided Baltimore to Super Bowl III and Miami to Super Bowl VI, Shula is also the only head coach to lead two NFL franchises to their Super Bowl debut.

Shula retired with an all-time regular and post season overall win-loss record of 347–173–6, which currently ranks him 1st in regular season wins (328) and overall total wins (347), making him the winningest head coach in NFL history in terms of coaching victories. As of 2024, Shula is the only head coach to win the AP NFL Coach of the Year Award four times (1964, 1967-1968, 1972). He was selected as a coach to the NFL 1970s All-Decade Team and enshrined into the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll immediately after his retirement in 1996. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997 in his first year of eligibility, and in 2019 was selected to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the 10 greatest head coaches in NFL History. Shula died in 2020 at the age of 90.

==Early life==
Shula was born on January 4, 1930, in Grand River, Ohio, a small town along the Lake Erie shore in the northeastern part of the state. His parents, Dan and Mary Shula (Dénes Süle and Mária Miller), were of Hungarian origin, having immigrated when they were children. Shula&#x27;s father Dan worked for $9 a week at a rose nursery and saved up to buy the small house where Shula spent his early childhood. The house was next door to a grocery store in Grand River owned by Mary&#x27;s parents. Shula played football in his neighborhood as a child, but his parents forbade it after he got a gash on his face when he was 11.

Shula had six siblings, including a set of triplets born in 1936. To meet the family&#x27;s financial needs, his father obtained a job in the local fishing industry for $15 a week, and later worked at a rayon plant in nearby Painesville, Ohio. Shula attended elementary school at St. Mary&#x27;s, a private Catholic school in Painesville; his mother was a devout Catholic, and his father converted to that denomination when they married.

==Playing career==
Shula later attended Harvey High School in Painesville, Ohio, where he played on its football team starting in 1945. He did not try out for the team because of his mother&#x27;s prohibition and because he was recovering from a bout of pneumonia, but an assistant football coach noticed him in a gym class and convinced him to join. Shula forged his parents&#x27; signatures to sign up.

Within weeks of joining Harvey&#x27;s football team, Shula was a starting left halfback in the school&#x27;s single-wing offense. He handled a large portion of the team&#x27;s rushing and passing duties, and helped lead the team to a 7–3 win–loss record in his senior year. It was the first time in 18 years that Harvey High School had had a seven-win season. The team would have won a league title had it not lost an early game to Willoughby. He also ran the 440-yard dash at Harvey and was an 11-time letterman in his three years there.

===John Carroll University===
As Shula prepared to graduate from high school in 1947, many men whose football careers were delayed by service in World War II were returning and competing for college athletic scholarships. As a result, Shula was unable to get a scholarship and contemplated working for a year before going to college. That summer, however, he had a chance meeting at a gas station with former Painesville football coach Howard Bauchman, who suggested he ask about a scholarship at John Carroll University.

Shula received a one-year scholarship at the private Jesuit school in University Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. It was extended to a full scholarship after Shula performed well during his freshman year, including a victory over Youngstown State in October 1948. He ran for 175 yards and scored two touchdowns substituting for the injured starting halfback. The same year, Shula considered joining the Catholic priesthood after a three-day retreat at John Carroll, but decided against it because of his commitment to football.

During his senior year in 1950, he rushed for 125 yards in a win over a heavily favored Syracuse team.

===Cleveland Browns===

Shula graduated in 1951 as a sociology major with a minor in mathematics, and was offered a job teaching and coaching at Canton Lincoln High School in Canton, Ohio for $3,750 a year (equivalent to $ in ). The Cleveland Browns of the National Football League, however, selected him in the ninth round of the 1951 draft that January. Cleveland had won the NFL championship the previous year behind a staunch defense and an offense led by quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and end Dante Lavelli. Shula was joined in the Browns&#x27; training camp by John Carroll teammate Carl Taseff, whom Cleveland coach Paul Brown selected in the 22nd round. Brown made the selections in part because John Carroll coach Herb Eisele attended his coaching clinics and used similar schemes and terminology as Brown did. Shula and Taseff both made the team and were its only two rookies in 1951. Shula signed a $5,000-a-year contract and played as a defensive back alongside Warren Lahr and Tommy James.

Shula played in all 12 of Cleveland&#x27;s games in 1951, making his first appearance as a starter in October, and recorded four interceptions. The Browns, meanwhile, finished with an 11–1 record and advanced to the championship game for a second straight year. The team lost the game 24–17 to the Los Angeles Rams in Los Angeles.

Shula was a member of an Ohio Army National Guard unit that was activated the following January during the Korean War. Military service in Ohio and at Fort Polk in Louisiana kept Shula away from football until the unit was deactivated that November. Returning to the Browns, Shula signed a $5,500-a-year contract and played in five games at the end of the season, having become a full-time starter because of injuries to other players. The Browns again advanced to the championship game and again lost, this time to the Detroit Lions.

===Baltimore Colts===
In early 1953, Brown traded Shula along with Taseff and eight other players to the Baltimore Colts in exchange for five Colts players including tackles Mike McCormack and Don Colo. Before joining Baltimore, Shula finished a master&#x27;s degree in physical education at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

Shula signed a $6,500-a-year contract with the Colts, which was preparing for its first season after relocating from Dallas, where the franchise had been called the Dallas Texans. The team replaced an earlier Colts franchise that folded after the 1950 season. The Colts finished with a 3–9 record in 1953 despite leading the NFL in defensive takeaways, including three interceptions by Shula. Baltimore continued to struggle the following year under new head coach Weeb Ewbank, a former Browns assistant. The team again finished 3–9 for last place in the NFL West, although Shula had a career-high five interceptions.

Shula had five interceptions again in 1955, but the Colts finished 5–6–1, well out of contention for the divisional championship. Shula missed the final three games of the season because of a broken jaw suffered in a 17–17 tie with the Los Angeles Rams. Ewbank brought in future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas as a backup in 1956, but the Colts posted a losing record even after Unitas became the starter partway through the season. Shula had just one interception that year.

The Colts waived Shula at the end of training camp in 1957 season, the last player cut as the team reduced its squad to 35 men, and the Washington Redskins picked him up. Shula spent one season with the Redskins before retiring. In his seven NFL seasons, he played in 73 games, intercepted 21 passes and recovered four fumbles.

==Coaching career==
===Early years (1958–1962)===
Shula got his first coaching job shortly after ending his playing career, signing as a defensive backs coach at the University of Virginia under Dick Voris in February 1958. Virginia finished with a 1–9 record that year. Shula got married in the summer before the season to Dorothy Bartish, who grew up near Painesville. Shula and Bartish had begun dating after he graduated from John Carroll; she was working as a teacher in Hawaii when he proposed.

After one season at Virginia, Shula moved to another defensive backs coaching job at the University of Kentucky in 1959 under head coach Blanton Collier. Collier had been an assistant to Paul Brown when Shula played in Cleveland. After one season in Kentucky, Shula got his first NFL coaching job as the defensive backfield coach for the Detroit Lions in 1960. The Lions posted winning records in each of Shula&#x27;s three seasons there under head coach George Wilson and finished in second place in the NFL West in 1961 and 1962. Detroit&#x27;s defense was near the top of the league in fewest points allowed when Shula coached there, including a second-place finish in 1962. The defense also led the league that year in fewest yards allowed, with 3,217. Detroit&#x27;s defense featured a group of linemen dubbed the &quot;Fearsome Foursome&quot; in 1962, consisting of defensive tackles Roger Brown and Alex Karras and defensive ends Darris McCord and Sam Williams.

===Baltimore Colts (1963–1969)===
Weeb Ewbank, under whom Shula had played in Cleveland and Baltimore, was fired as the Colts&#x27; head coach in 1963 following three disappointing seasons and disagreements over team strategy and organization with owner Carroll Rosenbloom. Rosenbloom immediately named Shula as the team&#x27;s next head coach, having recruited him for the job earlier.

Shula was only 33 years old, making him the youngest coach in league history at the time, but Rosenbloom was familiar with his personality and approach from his playing days in Baltimore. While Rosenbloom said he realized he was &quot;out on a limb&quot; in hiring Shula, he felt it would bring a sense of team spirit back to the Colts. While Shula had only been an average player, he was &quot;always... taking pictures, talking football&quot;, said Rosenbloom. &quot;He had always wanted to coach&quot;.

Shula lost his first regular-season game, a September 15 matchup against the Giants. The 1963 Colts won their next game, however, and went on to finish the season with an 8–6 record for third place in the NFL West. The team was still led by Johnny Unitas, who was Shula&#x27;s teammate during his final year as a player in Baltimore and had helped the Colts win championships in 1958 and 1959. The team&#x27;s primary receivers were end Raymond Berry and tight end John Mackey, while defensive end Gino Marchetti anchored the defense.

Shula guided the team to a 12–2 record in his second year as coach. That put the Colts on top of the NFL West and earned them a spot in the NFL championship against the Browns, which by then were coached by Collier. The Colts were heavily favored to win even by sportswriters in Cleveland, due in large part to their strong receiving corps and Unitas, who had 2,824 passing yards and won the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. Halfback Lenny Moore also had 19 touchdowns, setting an NFL record. In addition to having the NFL&#x27;s top-scoring offense, the Colts defense allowed the fewest points in the NFL. Before the championship, Collier said Shula had always thought about coaching even during his playing career, giving him &quot;the experience of a man in the profession for ten years&quot;. The Colts, however, lost to the Browns 27–0 in the title game. Despite the loss, Shula won the NFL&#x27;s Coach of the Year Award.

The Colts tied the Green Bay Packers with a 10–3–1 record at the end of the 1965 season, forcing a playoff to determine which of them would play in the championship game. The Colts had lost twice to the Packers during the regular season, and Unitas and backup Gary Cuozzo were sidelined by injuries as the playoffs approached. Baltimore got out to a 10–0 lead at halftime while using halfback Tom Matte at quarterback, but the Packers, coached by Vince Lombardi, made a comeback in the second half and tied the score at the end of regulation. The Colts stopped the Packers on their opening drive in the sudden-death overtime, but the ensuing drive ended with a missed field goal by placekicker Lou Michaels. The Packers then drove for a field goal of their own, winning 13–10. Shula said after the game that while his team could not expect to execute its usual strategy without Unitas and Cuozzo, the Colts &quot;don&#x27;t belong in this league&quot; if they could not beat Green Bay once in three tries.

The Colts fell to second place in the NFL West the following season, the first year a Super Bowl was played between the NFL champion and the winner of the rival American Football League. In 1967, the Colts again failed to make the playoffs despite a regular-season record of 11–1–2, losing the newly created Coastal Division on a tiebreaker with the Los Angeles Rams because the Rams scored more points in the games between the two clubs. The Colts&#x27; only loss was a 34–10 setback to the Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on the final Sunday of the season. Though the season ended in disappointment, Shula won his second Coach of the Year award, and Unitas was again the league&#x27;s MVP.

Before the 1968 season began, Unitas injured his elbow and was replaced by backup Earl Morrall. Expectations for Morrall were low, but the veteran quarterback led the Colts to a string of wins at the beginning of the season. Shula tried to ease Unitas back into the lineup, but the quarterback&#x27;s injury flared up numerous times, culminating with a game against Cleveland in which he had just one completion and three interceptions. That turned out to be the only loss of the season for Baltimore, which finished with a league-leading 13–1 record. The Colts beat the Minnesota Vikings in the Western Conference championship game, and then beat the Browns 34–0 in the NFL Championship Game the following week. That set up a matchup with the New York Jets in Super Bowl III. The Jets were coached by Ewbank, and led by quarterback Joe Namath, who guaranteed a victory before the game despite being the underdog. New York won the game 16–7.

Shula spent one more season as the head coach of the Colts, who posted an 8–5–1 record in 1969 and missed the playoffs. He compiled a 71–23–4 record in seven seasons in Baltimore, but was just 2–3 in the postseason, including upset losses in the 1964 NFL Championship Game and Super Bowl III, where the Colts were heavy favorites.

Shula&#x27;s 73 victories were the most in Colts history until 2007 when Tony Dungy surpassed him with his 74th win.

===Miami Dolphins (1970–1995)===
The relationship between Shula and Rosenbloom had soured after Shula&#x27;s Super Bowl loss in 1969, and when Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie offered the coach a $70,000-a-year contract, the powers of general manager, and a 10% ownership stake in the AFL team after that season, he jumped at the opportunity. Rosenbloom cried foul at an NFL meeting in 1970 in Hawaii, alleging that Robbie&#x27;s hiring of his coach violated the league&#x27;s prohibition on tampering, or negotiating to hire other teams&#x27; employees without seeking permission. Shula and Robbie hoped that Shula&#x27;s ownership stake and status as his own general manager would avoid tampering penalties under an exception for an employee leaving a club to &quot;better himself&quot;. League commissioner Pete Rozelle found the Dolphins in violation of the tampering policy because they did not seek permission to negotiate and did not notify the Colts of the hiring before its announcement. As punishment, Rozelle awarded the Colts Miami&#x27;s first-round pick in 1971.

The Dolphins had been one of the AFL&#x27;s worst teams in the years leading up to Shula&#x27;s hiring, which came as the AFL and NFL prepared to merge starting in the 1970 season. Between the team&#x27;s founding in 1966 and the 1969 season, the Dolphins won no more than five games in any season under coach George Wilson.

Shula led Miami to immediate success, delivering a 10–4 win–loss record in the 1970 season and a 10–3–1 record the following year, when the team won the AFC championship but lost Super Bowl VI to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 24–3. The team&#x27;s stars included several future Pro Football Hall of Fame members: quarterback Bob Griese, fullback Larry Csonka, guard Larry Little, center Jim Langer, linebacker Nick Buoniconti and wide receiver Paul Warfield, whom Shula acquired from the Browns in 1970 for a first-round draft pick.

Shula&#x27;s Miami teams during his first decade as coach were known for great offensive lines, led by Larry Little, Jim Langer, Bob Kuechenberg and Norm Evans, strong running games featuring Csonka, Jim Kiick, and Mercury Morris, quarterbacking by Griese and Earl Morrall and excellent receivers in Warfield, Howard Twilley and Jim Mandich. The Dolphins&#x27; defense was known as &quot;The No-Name Defense&quot;, though it had a number of outstanding players, including defensive tackle Manny Fernandez, linebacker Nick Buoniconti, and safeties Dick Anderson and Jake Scott.

In 1972, Shula led Miami to the NFL&#x27;s first and only perfect season, ending with a 17–0 record and a 14–7 victory in Super Bowl VII over the Washington Redskins. No other team has since equaled that feat; the 2007 Patriots went undefeated until losing to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl. Shula strung together the wins despite the loss of his quarterback, Griese, due to injury in the fifth game of the season. He was replaced by 38-year-old Earl Morrall, who had been the backup to Unitas during Shula&#x27;s years in Baltimore. Griese was able to return for the playoffs, leading the team in the Super Bowl win. That season, Shula would also be the first American professional football coach to reach 100 wins in his first decade as a head coach.

Shula&#x27;s 1973 team lost its second game of the season to the Oakland Raiders, ending an overall winning streak that stretched to 18 games. That run is tied for the third-longest in league history. The team finished with a 12–2 regular-season record and went on to win a second Super Bowl in a row, defeating the Minnesota Vikings 24–7.

The 1974 Dolphins had a chance to win a third title in a row, but they fell to the Oakland Raiders 28–26 in an AFC divisional playoff game. With 35 seconds remaining in the game, Oakland quarterback Ken Stabler was in the process of being sacked by Dolphins defensive end Vern Den Herder when, just before he was tackled, he completed a desperation forward pass to his running back Clarence Davis in the game&#x27;s final moments — since dubbed The Sea of Hands play. The Dolphins team was decimated the following season by the creation of the now-defunct World Football League and their inability to match contract offers from the rival league to three of its star players: Csonka, Warfield and Jim Kiick. All three left to join the Memphis Southmen for the 1975 season.

Shula led the team to more winning seasons through the 1970s and into the 1980s, only posting a losing record once, in 1976 when the team finished 6–8. The team advanced to the playoffs in 1978, 1979 and 1981, but lost in the first round each time. The playoff loss in the 1981 season against the San Diego Chargers was a hard-fought back-and-forth battle that many sportswriters, players and coaches consider one of the greatest games ever played. Shula called it &quot;maybe the greatest ever&quot;. The Chargers won the so-called Epic in Miami 41–38 with a field goal in double-overtime.

In 1982, Shula&#x27;s team advanced through the playoffs to the Super Bowl during the strike-shortened season, but lost the championship to the Washington Redskins. The offense was led by David Woodley and Don Strock, who shared duties at quarterback following Griese&#x27;s retirement after the 1980 season, and fullback Andra Franklin, who was second in the NFL in rushing. The defense, one of the best in the league, was nicknamed the &quot;Killer Bees&quot; because six starters&#x27; last names began with &quot;B&quot;, including defensive tackle Bob Baumhower, linebacker Bob Brudzinski and safeties Lyle Blackwood and his brother Glenn Blackwood.

The 1983 season marked the beginning of a new era in Miami with the selection of quarterback Dan Marino out of the University of Pittsburgh in the first round of the NFL draft. Marino won the starting job halfway through the 1983 regular season, and by 1984, the Dolphins were back in the Super Bowl, due largely to Marino&#x27;s record 5,084 yards through the air and 48 touchdown passes. The Dolphins, however, lost the game to the San Francisco 49ers, then led by quarterback Joe Montana.

Over the years, Shula&#x27;s relationship with Robbie chilled considerably, in part due to Robbie&#x27;s unwillingness to spend money on higher-profile players, which led to contract holdouts by Marino and linebacker John Offerdahl. Shula&#x27;s power over the Dolphins as general manager and part-owner of the team also led to conflict that at times burst into public view. When Shula arrived late to a banquet celebrating Miami&#x27;s 1974 Super Bowl win, Robbie ordered Shula to &quot;get the hell into the room,&quot; to which Shula replied that he&#x27;d &quot;knock you on your ass&quot; if Robbie shouted at him again.

One of the few times Shula came close to leaving Miami was during the 1983 season, when Donald Trump, the owner of the New Jersey Generals in the upstart United States Football League, offered Shula a $1 million-a-year contract–a significant increase from the $450,000 Shula was earning at the time with the Dolphins. Trump said the negotiations were derailed when Shula insisted on obtaining a rent-free apartment at Trump Tower. Shula broke off the negotiations and called the courtship &quot;a huge distraction&quot;, deciding to stay in Miami. Years later, Larry Csonka, by then an executive with the Jacksonville Bulls, said that he believed Shula would have taken the job with Trump&#x27;s team, but he was angered at being &quot;thrown out to the press&quot; by Trump.

After the 1984 season, Shula&#x27;s teams posted only one losing record, but they never again advanced to the Super Bowl. The Dolphins reached the playoffs in 1985, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1995, Shula&#x27;s final season. On October 2, 1994, Don Shula&#x27;s Miami Dolphins defeated son David Shula&#x27;s Cincinnati Bengals by a score of 23–7. Dubbed the “Shula Bowl”, it marked the first time in NFL history that a head coaching matchup featured father against son. Shula&#x27;s retirement in 1996 was tinged by speculation that he was forced out by Wayne Huizenga, a businessman who took full ownership of the team in 1994 from the Robbie family, who inherited it after Robbie&#x27;s death in 1990. Shula said he was &quot;at peace with myself&quot; in making the decision to step away from the game at 66 years old. He finished his coaching career with a 328–156–6 regular-season record, giving him the all-time lead in wins for an NFL head coach.

Shula changed his coaching strategy as his personnel changed. His Super Bowl teams in 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1982 were keyed by a run-first offensive strategy and a dominating defense. In the years when Marino was quarterback, the team leaned on its offense, and particularly its passing attack, to win games. &quot;I&#x27;ve been accused of being a conservative, &#x27;grind&#x27;em-out&#x27; kind of coach, because that was the style of my teams in 1972–73, but I point out that when I was at Baltimore, and Johnny Unitas was my quarterback, we used to have a wide-open, explosive passing attack,&quot; Shula said in 1985. &quot;And when I came down to Miami, I didn&#x27;t try to jam the Unitas style down the throat of Bob Griese, who was a different kind of quarterback, nor did I try to force the Griese style on Marino when he came along.&quot;

==Later life and death==

Shula entered the branding business in 1989, lending his name to a steakhouse owned by the wealthy Graham family, who became friends with Shula and his family after the Shulas moved to the Graham-developed suburb of Miami Lakes. Dozens of Shula-branded restaurants opened in the ensuing years, primarily in Florida, including steakhouses, burger restaurants and bars. Shula also put his name on other Graham-owned properties in 1991, including the family&#x27;s hotel in Miami Lakes where his first steakhouse was located. It was renamed Don Shula&#x27;s Hotel &amp; Golf Club in exchange for an equity stake in the family&#x27;s hospitality division. He remained active in the branding business during his retirement, and the company bearing his name expanded, although his son Dave assumed management of the firm during his later years.

Shula also became a frequent product promoter in his later years, working for Miami-based auto dealership Warren Henry, HearUSA hearing aids, NutriSystem diet plans, Humana health insurance and Budweiser beer, among others. In 2007, he joined his wife Mary Ann in promoting NutriSystem diets geared for people age 60 and older. &quot;If it&#x27;s something I feel fits into my personality, what I feel is important and what I actually do, then I&#x27;ll do it. It&#x27;s all things that I enjoy doing and take a lot of pride in representing,&quot; he said in 2012. As part of a government public awareness campaign, Shula was the first American to enroll in the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, just after midnight on November 15, 2005.

After Shula&#x27;s retirement, he was named the Dolphins&#x27; vice-chairman. He maintained other connections to football in retirement, often appearing in ceremonial roles. In 2003, at Super Bowl XXXVII in San Diego, he performed the ceremonial coin toss to end the pregame ceremonies. In 2007, at Super Bowl XLI in Miami Gardens, Shula took part in the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation. On February 3, 2008, he attended Super Bowl XLII in Glendale, Arizona, in which the Patriots could have matched his Dolphins team&#x27;s perfect season, but lost.

Shula was also an avid golfer after his coaching career and had a home near the Indian Creek Country Club in the wealthy enclave of Indian Creek, Florida as well as a condominium overlooking the Links at Pebble Bay in Pebble Beach, California. On March 25, 2007, Shula presented the Winners Cup to Tiger Woods, winner of the 2007 WGC-CA Golf Tournament held at the Doral Resort in Miami.

Shula was involved in a number of activities outside of sports. In 2011, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of his humanitarian efforts. And at John Carroll University, he endowed the Don Shula Chair in Philosophy, which supports the Philosophy Department by presenting programs of interest to philosophers and the general public.

Shula suffered from sleep apnea and heart issues toward the end of his life, and had a pacemaker implanted in 2016. Shula died on May 4, 2020, at the age of 90 at his home in Indian Creek.

==Personal life==

Shula married Painesville, Ohio native Dorothy Bartish, with whom he was in a relationship since high school, on July 19, 1958, after his playing career ended. They had five children: Dave (b. May 28, 1959), Donna (b. April 28, 1961), Sharon (b. June 30, 1962), Anne (b. May 7, 1964), and Mike (b. June 3, 1965). Dorothy died of breast cancer on February 25, 1991, aged 57. That same year, the Don Shula Foundation for Breast Cancer Research was founded.

He married his second wife, Mary Anne Stephens, on October 15, 1993. They resided in the Indian Creek home Mary Anne had received in her divorce settlement from her third husband, investment banker Jackson T. Stephens. The couple split their time between Indian Creek and a home in San Francisco where they stayed during Florida&#x27;s hurricane season.

Shula was a devout Catholic throughout his life. He said in 1974, at the peak of his coaching career, that he attended Mass every morning. Shula once considered becoming a Catholic priest, but decided he could not commit to being both priest and coach.

==Legacy==
Shula set numerous records in his 33 seasons as a head coach. He is the all-time leader in victories with 347 when including the postseason. He is first in most games coached, with 526, most consecutive seasons coached, with 33, and Super Bowl losses with four, tied with Bud Grant, Dan Reeves, and Marv Levy. His teams won 15 division titles, six conference title wins, two NFL championships and six Super Bowl appearances.

Shula&#x27;s teams were consistently among the least penalized in the NFL.

Shula was known as a tough and practical coach who worked players hard and put an emphasis on discipline, which helped reduce errors in games. However, while he looked the tough-guy part, Shula paired it with a sharp football mind that helped keep him ahead of the competition.

During the last 20 years of his coaching career, Shula served on the NFL&#x27;s Competition Committee, an era when the body pushed through rules that made the league more pass-oriented.

Shula had a winning record against almost every coach he faced, with seven exceptions: Levy, against whom he was 6–14 during the regular season and 0–3 in the playoffs; John Madden, against whom he was 2–2 in the regular season and 1–2 in the playoffs for a total of 3–4; and Bill Cowher, against whom Shula was 1–2 late in his career. Shula also had losing records against Tom Flores (1–6) Raymond Berry (3–8), Walt Michaels (5–7–1), and Vince Lombardi (5–8).

Shula has the distinction of having coached five different quarterbacks to Super Bowl appearances: Johnny Unitas and Earl Morrall in 1968, Bob Griese in 1971, 1972, and 1973, David Woodley in 1982, and Dan Marino in 1984, three of them future Hall of Famers. He also coached Johnny Unitas to another World Championship appearance in the pre-Super Bowl era in 1964. The only other NFL coach to approach this distinction is Joe Gibbs, who coached four Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks — Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, and Mark Rypien — winning three times.

Shula was added to the Miami Dolphin Honor Roll on November 25, 1996, not long after he retired. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997, in his first year of eligibility. In 1999, Shula was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor coach Vince Lombardi&#x27;s legacy, and is given annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the coach. On January 31, 2010, a statue of him was unveiled at Hard Rock Stadium, where the Dolphins play. The stadium&#x27;s street address is 347 Don Shula Drive, making reference to his career win total. In 2011, he was added to a Walk of Fame outside the stadium, and in 2013 he attended a White House ceremony honoring the 1972 team&#x27;s perfect season.

Shula is honored at the Don Shula Stadium at John Carroll University, which was named after him when it opened in 2003, and the Don Shula Expressway in Miami, which was dedicated in 1983. Since 2002, an annual college football game between South Florida schools Florida Atlantic and FIU is named the Shula Bowl in his honor. The game&#x27;s winner receives a traveling trophy named the Don Shula Award.

==Literary works==

Shula co-authored three books: &quot;The Winning Edge&quot; (1973) with Lou Sahadi , &quot;Everyone&#x27;s a Coach&quot; (1995) , and &quot;The Little Black Book of Coaching: Motivating People to be Winners&quot; (2001); , both with Ken Blanchard (author of The One Minute Manager).

<doc id="638066" wikidata="Q1070834" url="?curid=638066" title="IQ and the Wealth of Nations">
<text>IQ and the Wealth of Nations is a 2002 book by psychologist Richard Lynn and political scientist Tatu Vanhanen. The authors argue that differences in national income (in the form of per capita gross domestic product) are correlated with differences in the average national intelligence quotient (IQ). They further argue that differences in average national IQs constitute one important factor, but not the only one, contributing to differences in national wealth and rates of economic growth.

The book has drawn widespread criticism from other academics. Critiques have included questioning of the methodology used, the incompleteness of the data, and the conclusions drawn from the analysis. The 2006 book &quot;IQ and Global Inequality&quot; is a follow-up to &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot; by the same authors.

==Outline==
The book includes the authors&#x27; calculation of average IQ scores for 60 countries, based on their analysis of published reports. It reports their observation that national IQ correlates with gross domestic product per capita at 0.82, and with the rate of economic growth from 1950 to 1990 at 0.64.

The authors believe that average IQ differences between nations are due to both genetic and environmental factors. They also believe that low GDP can cause low IQ, just as low IQ can cause low GDP. (See Positive feedback).

The authors write that it is the ethical responsibility of rich, high-IQ nations to assist poor, low-IQ nations financially, as it is the responsibility of rich citizens to assist the poor.

==National IQ estimates==
The result claims that Hong Kong has the highest national IQ estimate with 107, followed by South Korea with 106.

Central to the book&#x27;s thesis is a tabulation of what Lynn and Vanhanen believe to be the average IQs of the world&#x27;s nations. Rather than do their own IQ studies, the authors average and adjust existing studies and use other methods to create estimates.

For 104 of the 185 nations, no studies were available. In those cases, the authors have used an estimated value by taking averages of the IQs of neighboring or comparable nations. For example, the authors arrived at a figure of 84 for El Salvador by averaging their calculations of 79 for Guatemala and 88 for Colombia. Including those estimated IQs, the correlation of IQ and GDP is 0.62.

To obtain a figure for South Africa, the authors averaged IQ studies done on different ethnic groups, resulting in a figure of 72. The figures for Colombia, Peru, and Singapore were arrived at in a similar manner.

In some cases, the IQ of a country is estimated by averaging the IQs of countries that are not actually neighbors of the country in question. For example, Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s IQ is estimated by averaging the IQs of Iran and Turkey, neither of which is close to Kyrgyzstan—China, which is a geographic neighbor, is not counted as such by Lynn and Vanhanen. This is because ethnic background is assumed to be more important than proximity to other nations when determining national IQ.

To account for the Flynn effect (an increase in IQ scores over time), the authors adjusted the results of older studies upward by a number of points.

===Scores that do not support the theory===
In several cases the actual GDP did not correspond with that predicted by IQ. In these cases, the authors argued that differences in GDP were caused by differences in natural resources and whether the nation used a planned or market economy.

One example of this was Qatar, whose IQ was estimated by Lynn and Vanhanen to be about 78, yet had a disproportionately high per capita GDP of roughly US$17,000. The authors explain Qatar&#x27;s disproportionately high GDP by its high petroleum resources. Similarly, the authors think that large resources of diamonds explain the economic growth of the African nation Botswana, the fastest in the world for several decades.

The authors argued that the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s per capita GDP of at the time roughly US$4,500 could be explained by its use of a communist economic system for much of its recent history. The authors also predicted that communist nations whom they believe have comparatively higher IQs, including China and North Korea, can be expected to rapidly gain GDP growth by moving from centrally planned economies to more capitalist based economic systems, while predicting continued poverty for sub-Saharan African nations no matter what economic systems are used.

== Reception and impact ==

Several negative reviews of the book have been published in the scholarly literature. Susan Barnett and Wendy Williams wrote that &quot;we see an edifice built on layer upon layer of arbitrary assumptions and selective data manipulation. The data on which the entire book is based are of questionable validity and are used in ways that cannot be justified.&quot; They also wrote that cross country comparisons are &quot;virtually meaningless.&quot;

Richardson (2004) argued, citing the Flynn effect as the best evidence, that Lynn has the causal connection backwards and suggested that &quot;the average IQ of a population is simply an index of the size of its middle class, both of which are results of industrial development&quot;. The review concludes that &quot;This is not so much science, then, as a social crusade.&quot; A review by Michael Palairet criticized the book&#x27;s methodology, particularly the imprecise estimates of GDP and the fact that IQ data were only available for 81 of the 185 countries studied. However, the review concluded that the book was &quot;a powerful challenge to economic historians and development economists who prefer not to use IQ as an analytical input&quot;, but that it&#x27;s likely those scholars will deliberately ignore this work instead of improving it.

===By economists===
In a book review for the &quot;Journal of Economic Literature&quot;, Thomas Nechyba wrote that &quot;such sweeping conclusions based on relatively weak statistical evidence and dubious presumptions seem misguided at best and quite dangerous if taken seriously. It is therefore difficult to find much to recommend in this book.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;Economic Journal&quot;, Astrid Oline Ervik said that the book may be &quot;thought provoking&quot;, but there is nothing that economists can learn from it. She criticized the book&#x27;s authors for not establishing cross country comparability and reliability of IQ scores, for relying on simple bivariate correlations, for not considering or controlling for other hypotheses, and for confusing correlation with causation. Ervik stated, &quot;The arguments put forward in the book to justify such comparisons [between the average IQ in different countries and their GDP] seem at best vague and unconvincing. At worst, passages in the book appear to be biased and unscientific...The authors fail to present convincing evidence and appear to jump to conclusions.&quot;

Edward Miller, an economist who has published many controversial papers on race and intelligence, gave the book positive reviews in two different white nationalist publications, the &quot;Journal of Social, Political, and Economic Studies&quot; and &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot;.

===Criticism of data sets===
Academic reviews of the book generally criticized both its methodology and conclusions.

The methods of the study were criticized by Richard E. Nisbett for relying on small and haphazard samples and for ignoring data that did not support the conclusions.

University of Reading geographer Stephen Morse also criticized the book (as well as &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot;), arguing that the authors&#x27; hypothesis rests on &quot;serious flaws&quot;. Morse also argued: &quot;The central dilemma of the Lynn and Vanhanen case rests with their assumption that national IQ data are primarily (not wholly) a function of innate ability, which in turn is at least partly generated by genes. There are many assumptions of cause–effect in here, and some of them involve substantial leaps of faith.&quot;

In the 2010 paper &quot;A systematic literature review of the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans&quot;, also published in &quot;Intelligence&quot;, Jelte M. Wicherts and colleagues stated:

Lynn and Gerhard Meisenberg replied that &quot;critical evaluation of the studies presented by WDM shows that many of these are based on unrepresentative elite samples&quot; and that a further literature review, including taking into account results in mathematics, science, and reading, gave &quot;an IQ of 68 as the best reading of the IQ in sub-Saharan Africa&quot;. Wicherts and colleagues in yet another reply stated: &quot;In light of all the available IQ data of over 37,000 African testtakers, only the use of unsystematic methods to exclude the vast majority of data could result in a mean IQ close to 70. On the basis of sound methods, the average IQ remains close to 80. Although this mean IQ is clearly lower than 100, we view it as unsurprising in light of the potential of the Flynn effect in Africa (Wicherts, Borsboom, &amp; Dolan, 2010) and common psychometric problems associated with the use of western IQ tests among Africans.&quot;

Some criticisms have focused on the limited number of studies upon which the book is based. The IQ figures are based on 3 different studies for 17 nations, two studies for 30 nations, and one study for 34 nations. There were actual tests for IQ in the case of 81 countries out of the 185 countries studied. For 104 nations there were no IQ studies at all and IQ was estimated based on the average IQ of surrounding nations. The limited number of participants in some studies as well as outdated data has also been criticized. A test of 108 9- to 15-year-olds in Barbados, of 50 13- to 16-year-olds in Colombia, of 104 5- to 17-year-olds in Ecuador, of 129 6- to 12-year-olds in Egypt, and of 48 10- to 14-year-olds in Equatorial Guinea, all were taken as measures of national IQ.

Denny Borsboom argued that mainstream contemporary test analysis does not reflect substantial recent developments in the field and &quot;bears an uncanny resemblance to the psychometric state of the art as it existed in the 1950s&quot;. For example, he argued that &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot;, in order to show that the tests are unbiased, uses outdated methodology if anything, indicative that test bias exists. Girma Berhanu, in an essay review of the book, concentrated on the discussion of Ethiopian Jews. The review criticized the principal assertion of the authors that differences in intelligence, attributed to genetics, account for the gap between rich and poor countries. Berhanu criticized the book as being based in a &quot;racist, sexist, and antihuman&quot; research tradition and alleged that &quot;the low standards of scholarship evident in the book render it largely irrelevant for modern science&quot;.

===Impact on psychology===
In 2006, Lynn and Vanhanen followed &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot; with their book &quot;IQ and Global Inequality&quot;, which contained additional data and analyses, but the same general conclusions as the earlier book. Discussing both books, Earl Hunt writes that although Lynn and Vanhanen&#x27;s methodology and conclusions are questionable, they deserve credit for raising important questions about international IQ comparisons. Hunt writes that Lynn and Vanhanen are correct that national IQs correlate strongly with measures of social well-being, but they are unjustified in their rejection of the idea that national IQs could change as a result of improved education.

On July 27, 2020, the European Human Behavior and Evolution Association issued a formal statement opposing the utilization of Lynn&#x27;s national IQ dataset, as well as all updated forms of it, citing various criticisms of its methodology and data collection. They concluded that &quot;any conclusions drawn from analyses which 
use these data are therefore unsound, and no reliable evolutionary work should be using these data.&quot;

<doc id="638069" wikidata="Q582811" url="?curid=638069" title="Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy">
<text>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a 1974 spy novel by the author and former spy John le Carré. It follows the endeavours of the taciturn, ageing spymaster George Smiley to uncover a Soviet mole in the British Secret Intelligence Service. The novel has received critical acclaim for its complex social commentary—and, at the time, relevance, following the defection of Kim Philby. It was followed by &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; in 1979. The three novels together make up the &quot;Karla Trilogy&quot;, named after Smiley&#x27;s long-time nemesis Karla, the head of Soviet foreign intelligence and the trilogy&#x27;s overarching antagonist.

The novel has been adapted into both a television series and a film, and remains a staple of the spy fiction genre. In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

== Plot ==
=== Background ===
As the tension of the Cold War is peaking in 1973, George Smiley, former senior official in Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service (known as &quot;the Circus&quot; because its London office is at Cambridge Circus), is living unhappily in forced retirement, following the failure of an operation codenamed Testify in Czechoslovakia which ended in the capture and torture of agent Jim Prideaux. Control, chief of the Circus, had suspected that one of the five senior intelligence officers at the Circus was a Soviet mole, and had assigned them code names for Prideaux to relay back to the Circus, derived from the English children&#x27;s rhyme &quot;Tinker, Tailor&quot;:&lt;poem&gt;Tinker, tailor,
soldier, sailor,
rich man, poor man,
beggarman, thief.&lt;/poem&gt;
The failure resulted in the dismissal of Control, Smiley, and allies such as Connie Sachs and Jerry Westerby, and their replacement by a new guard consisting of Percy Alleline, Toby Esterhase, Bill Haydon, and Roy Bland. Control has since died, and Smiley&#x27;s former protégé, Peter Guillam, has been demoted to the &quot;scalphunters&quot;.

Guillam unexpectedly approaches Smiley and takes him to the house of Under-Secretary Oliver Lacon, the civil servant who oversees the Circus. There they meet Ricki Tarr, an agent recently declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; due to suspicion of having defected. Tarr defends himself by explaining that he was informed of a Soviet mole at the highest level of the Circus – codenamed Gerald – by Irina, the wife of a trade delegate, while in Hong Kong. Irina claimed that the mole, Gerald, reports to a Soviet official stationed at the embassy in London called Polyakov. Shortly after Tarr relayed this to the Circus, Irina was forcibly returned to the Soviet Union, leading Tarr to suspect that the mole was real, and now knew his identity. Tarr went into hiding, resurfacing to contact Guillam.

Lacon reasons that neither Smiley nor Guillam can be the mole, due to their respective dismissal and demotion, and so requests that Smiley investigate the presence of the mole in total secrecy to avoid another PR scandal for both the Government and the Circus. Smiley cautiously agrees, and forms a team consisting of himself, Guillam, Tarr, and retired Scotland Yard Inspector Mendel. Smiley is also given access to Circus documents, and begins by examining Alleline&#x27;s restructuring, discovering the ousting of Jerry Westerby and Connie Sachs, as well as slush fund payments to Jim Prideaux.

===Smiley begins the hunt===
Smiley visits Sachs, discovering that she confronted Alleline about her discovery that Polyakov was actually a Soviet Colonel called Gregor Viktorov, but he ordered her to drop the subject. She also mentions rumours of a secret Soviet facility for training moles, and makes allusions to Prideaux and Bill Haydon&#x27;s relationship being more than just platonic friendship.

Smiley examines Operation Witchcraft, an operation in which Soviet intelligence was obtained through a key source known as &quot;Merlin&quot;, which was treated with suspicion by both Smiley and Control. Alleline obtained ministerial support to circumvent Control&#x27;s authority, and his post-Testify promotion supporters Haydon, Esterhase, and Bland have sponsored it. Smiley also learns that this &quot;Magic Circle&quot; has obtained a safe house somewhere in London where they obtain information from a Merlin emissary posted in London under a diplomatic cover, who – Smiley concludes – is Polyakov himself.

Smiley suspects that the Circus does not realise the flow of information is going the other way, with the mole &quot;Gerald&quot; passing important British secrets (&quot;gold dust&quot;) in return for low-grade Soviet material (&quot;chicken feed&quot;), which would make &quot;Witchcraft&quot; simply a cover for the mole.

===Karla===
Smiley also discovers that the log from the night Tarr reported in from Hong Kong has been removed, and Guillam starts to suffer from paranoia as a result of their operation. Smiley tells Guillam that he suspects a Soviet intelligence officer named Karla is linked in some way to the operation, and reveals what he knows about him. Karla is believed to have followed his father into espionage, getting his start during the Spanish Civil War posing as a White Russian émigré in the forces of General Francisco Franco, recruiting foreign, mainly German, operatives. After this the Circus lost track of Karla, but he resurfaced during Operation Barbarossa, directing partisan operations behind German lines. Smiley explains his belief that somewhere in the gap between these two conflicts, Karla travelled to England and recruited Gerald.

Smiley points out that Karla is fiercely loyal to both the Soviet Union and communism, highlighting Karla&#x27;s current rank despite his internment in a gulag by the Stalinist regime, and reveals that Karla turned down an offer from Smiley in India to defect, even though his return to the USSR in 1955 was to face a likely execution. During his attempt to obtain Karla&#x27;s defection, Smiley plied him with cigarettes and promises that they could get Karla&#x27;s family out to the West safely. Smiley suspects that this only revealed his own weakness, his love for his unfaithful wife, Ann. Smiley offered Karla his lighter, a present from Ann, to light a cigarette, but Karla rose and left with it.

===Merlin and Testify===
Smiley suspects a link between Merlin and the botched Operation Testify. Sam Collins, who was duty officer that night, tells Smiley that Control ordered him to relay the report of the Czech operation only to him, but that when he did so, Control froze up, and that Bill Haydon&#x27;s sudden arrival was the only reason the hierarchy didn&#x27;t fall apart that night. Smiley then visits Max, a Czech operative who served as a legman for Prideaux on the operation, who tells Smiley that Prideaux gave him instructions to leave Czechoslovakia any way he could if Prideaux didn&#x27;t surface at the rendezvous at the appointed time. Smiley next visits Jerry Westerby, who tells Smiley about the trip to Prague when a young army conscript insisted that the Russians were in the woods waiting for Prideaux a full day before he was ambushed.

Finally, Smiley tracks down Prideaux. Prideaux tells him Control believed there was a mole in the Circus, and had whittled it down to five men, Alleline (Tinker), Haydon (Tailor), Bland (Soldier), Esterhase (Poorman), and Smiley himself (Beggarman), and that his orders were to obtain the identity from a defector in Czech intelligence who knew. He tells Smiley he almost didn&#x27;t make the rendezvous with Max because he noticed he was being tailed, and that when he arrived to meet the defector, he was ambushed, taking two bullets to his right shoulder. During his captivity, both Polyakov and Karla interrogated him, focusing solely on the extent and status of Control&#x27;s investigation. Prideaux suggests that the Czech defector was a plant, contrived by Karla to engineer Control&#x27;s downfall through Testify&#x27;s failure, all conceived to protect the mole.

===Catching the mole===
Smiley confronts Toby Esterhase, stating that he is aware that Esterhase has been posing as a Russian mole, with Polyakov as his handler, in order to provide cover for Merlin&#x27;s emissary Polyakov. Smiley compels Esterhase into revealing the location of the safe house, through making him realise that not only is there a real Soviet mole embedded in the SIS, but also that Polyakov has not been &quot;turned&quot; to work in British interest pretending to run the &quot;mole&quot; Esterhase, and in fact remains Karla&#x27;s agent. Tarr is sent to Paris, where he passes a coded message to Alleline about &quot;information crucial to the well-being of the Service&quot;. This triggers an emergency meeting between Gerald and Polyakov at the safe house, where Smiley and Guillam are lying in wait.

Haydon is revealed to be the mole, and his interrogation reveals that he had been recruited several decades ago by Karla and became a full-fledged Soviet spy partly for political reasons, partly in frustration at Britain&#x27;s rapidly declining influence on the world stage, particularly on account of the failings at Suez. He is expected to be exchanged with the Soviet Union for several of the agents he betrayed, but is killed shortly before he is due to leave England. Although the identity of his killer is not explicitly revealed, it is strongly implied to be Prideaux, due to the method of execution echoing the way he euthanises an injured owl earlier in the book, Prideaux&#x27;s implied threat to execute a driver in Czechoslovakia in the same way that Haydon is killed, and a sense Smiley has of someone with Prideaux&#x27;s background observing some of his later interrogations. Smiley is appointed temporary head of the Circus to deal with the fallout, and is still head at the start of the second book of &quot;The Karla Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;.

== Background ==
&quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; is the fifth of le Carré&#x27;s spy novels to feature the character of George Smiley (the first four being: &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;, and &quot;The Looking Glass War&quot;) and the fictionalised intelligence agency of &quot;the Circus.&quot; Two of the characters, Peter Guillam and Inspector Mendel, first appeared in &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, while Control appeared in &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.&quot; With &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, le Carré returned to the world of spy fiction after his non-espionage novel, &quot;The Naïve and Sentimental Lover&quot;, was panned by critics.
When &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; was published in 1974, revelations exposing the presence of Soviet double agents in Britain were still fresh in public memory. Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, and Kim Philby, later known as members of the Cambridge Five, had been exposed as KGB spies. The five had risen to very senior positions in the British diplomatic service. 

John le Carré, whose real name was David Cornwell, worked as an intelligence officer for MI5 and MI6 (SIS) in the 1950s and early 1960s. Senior SIS officer Kim Philby&#x27;s defection to the USSR in 1963, and the consequent compromising of British agents, was a factor in the 1964 termination of Cornwell&#x27;s intelligence career. Le Carré also drew from the paranoid atmosphere created by CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton, who after Philby&#x27;s defection became convinced that there were other moles operating at the highest levels of Western intelligence agencies.

The title alludes to the nursery rhyme and counting game Tinker Tailor.

&quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; is set against a theme of decline in British influence on the world stage after the Second World War, with the USSR and the USA emerging as the dominant superpowers during the Cold War. Mark Fisher said the notion of &quot;postcolonial melancholia&quot; hangs over the novel, arguing that both the protagonists and antagonists are motivated by what they see as Britain&#x27;s &quot;irreversible decline.&quot; These themes are particularly found in the character of Bill Haydon, who is modelled off the upper-class double agent Kim Philby. After his unmasking and capture, Haydon voices both a latent hostility towards the United States and a mourning of Britain&#x27;s lack of &quot;relevance or moral viability in world affairs.&quot; The novel is emblematic of a British &quot;rottenness,&quot; according to critic David Monaghan, and le Carré locates it with a failure of the British ruling class itself, which has become directionless and self-seeking.

Central to the novel is the theme of betrayal. Melvyn Bragg wrote that le Carré sought to illustrate that &quot;the public or institutional default is always more excusable than the personal betrayal of faith.&quot; Haydon&#x27;s betrayal of the Circus to Karla comes as a reaction to a postwar world that &quot;[deprived] him of the Empire he was trained to rule.&quot; Monaghan notes that le Carré (in &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot;) refers to Haydon as a &quot;born deceiver,&quot; who betrays his colleague (Smiley), his lover (Ann and/or Prideaux) and his country. Nevertheless, Haydon&#x27;s exact motivations are left vague – unlike Philby, who espoused a deep ideological commitment to communism.&quot;

Historian David A.T. Stafford considered Haydon&#x27;s eventual capture to be a mythologised reimagining of the Philby affair. He noted that, &quot;far from receiving his just desserts,&quot; the real-life mole ended up alive and well in Moscow, thanks to the incompetence of his superiors and the wilful ignorance of his colleagues. &quot;That Philby was protected by a conspiracy of class is true enough, but that he was unmasked by a Smiley is not... &quot;Tinker Tailor&quot; is a fantasy; George Smiley a myth.&quot; In this sense, Stafford considers Smiley and Haydon to exist as classic foils to each other: 

Tom Maddox wrote that Smiley&#x27;s conflict with the Circus, past and present, represents the idealistic virtues of the Second World War that are &quot;at odds&quot; with the inhumanity, sophistry, and careerism of the spying profession. &quot;The secret service seeks to dispense with that humanity, the consensus on high being that humane virtues have outlasted whatever limited usefulness they might have had. So Smiley comes and goes, comes and goes.&quot; Fisher noted Smiley&#x27;s characterisation as an outsider to the affairs the Circus, representing an archetypical Englishness that is both &quot;stolid&quot; and &quot;voyeuristic&quot;. Fisher likens Smiley in the novel to both King Arthur — a &quot;perpetually cuckolded&quot; figure &quot;returning to save his ailing kingdom&quot; — as well as T. S. Eliot&#x27;s figure of J. Alfred Prufrock, who is at once self-conscious and &quot;pathologically self-blinding&quot; to his weaknesses.

== Characters ==
* George Smiley – Formerly a senior officer in the Circus, who was pushed out at the same time as Control, his mentor. Smiley&#x27;s timid nature and unassuming appearance belies his keen understanding of spycraft. He is called upon to investigate the presence of a Soviet mole in the Circus. Various inspirations for Smiley have been suggested, including le Carré&#x27;s superior in MI5, John Bingham, and MI6 chief Maurice Oldfield (who took the position in 1973, a year before the book was published).
* Peter Guillam — Head of the scalphunters, the section of the Circus used in operations that require physical action and/or violence. Previously the head of Satellites Four, in charge of East German operations, he was &quot;exiled&quot; to the scalphunters outstation in Brixton after Control was dismissed. Son of a French businessman and an Englishwoman, he is a longtime associate of Smiley&#x27;s.
* Jim Prideaux — Former field agent and head of the scalphunters, Prideaux was shot in Czechoslovakia under the codename &quot;Jim Ellis&quot; during Operation Testify and kept in Soviet captivity. Now teaches at a boys&#x27; prep school. He was first identified as a prospective recruit by fellow student Bill Haydon at Oxford.
* Control — Longtime head of the Circus, now dead. Once a Cambridge don, he becomes convinced that one of his subordinates is a Soviet agent, and spends the last years of his tenure trying to uncover them.
* Sir Percy Alleline — Chief of the Circus following Control&#x27;s ousting. Alleline spent his early career in South America, northern Africa and India. He is vain and overambitious, and is despised by Control. Alleline is knighted in the course of the book in recognition of the quality of the intelligence provided by the source codenamed Merlin.
* Bill Haydon — Commander of London Station, he has worked with the Circus since the war. A polymath, he was recruited at Oxford where he was a close companion of Prideaux. A distant cousin of Ann Smiley, he has an affair with her, and this knowledge subsequently becomes widely known. One of the four who ran the double agent codenamed Merlin.
* Roy Bland — Second in command of London Station to Bill Haydon. Recruited by Smiley at Oxford, he was the top specialist in Soviet satellite states and spent several years undercover as a left-wing academic in the Balkans before being instated in the Circus.
* Toby Esterhase — He is the head of the Acton lamplighters, the section of the Circus responsible for surveillance and wiretapping. Hungarian by birth, Esterhase is an anglophile with pretensions of being a British gentleman. He was recruited by Smiley as &quot;a starving student in Vienna.&quot;
* Oliver Lacon — A permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office. Civilian overseer of the Circus. A former Cambridge rowing blue; his father &quot;a dignitary of the Scottish church&quot; and his mother &quot;something noble.&quot;
* Mendel — Retired former inspector in the Special Branch, he assists Smiley during his investigation. Frequently a go-between for Smiley and other members helping him investigate.
* Connie Sachs — Former Russia analyst for the Circus, she is forced to retire, and now runs a rooming house in Oxford. Alcoholic, but with an excellent memory. She is said to have been modelled upon Milicent Bagot.
* Ricki Tarr — A field agent and presumed defector who supplies information that indicates there is a Soviet mole in the Circus. He was trained by Smiley. Worked for Guillam as one of the scalphunters before going AWOL in Hong Kong.
* Sam Collins - a Circus officer deputed by Control to be duty officer on the night Operation Testify was to take place. Later sacked by Percy Alleline for drinking on duty, and became a front of house manager for a London casino.
* Jerry Westerby - a journalist occasionally used by the Circus as a postman. He was in Czechoslovakia at thr time of Operation Testify and reported that the Russians were waiting for Jim Prideaux a day in advance. Toby Esterhase ridiculed the information and accused Westerby of being a habitual drunkard.
* Miles Sercombe — The government minister to whom Lacon and the Circus are responsible. A distant cousin of Smiley&#x27;s wife, he plays a peripheral role in Smiley&#x27;s investigation. Not highly regarded.

== Jargon ==
&quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; employs spy jargon that is presented as the authentic insider-speak of British Intelligence. Le Carré noted that, with the exception of a few terms like &quot;mole&quot; and &quot;legend&quot;, this jargon was his own invention. In some cases, terms used in the novel have subsequently entered espionage parlance. For example, the terms &quot;mole&quot;, implying a long-term spy, and &quot;honey trap&quot;, implying a ploy in which an attractive person lures another into revealing information, were first introduced in this novel, and have only subsequently entered general usage.

The television adaptation of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; also uses the term &quot;burrower&quot; for a researcher recruited from a university, a term taken from the novel&#x27;s immediate sequel &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;.

===Moscow Centre===
Moscow Centre is a nickname used by John le Carré for the Moscow central headquarters of the KGB, especially those departments concerned with foreign espionage and counterintelligence. It arises from use by Soviet officers themselves, and Le Carré likely just used the nickname to gain greater credibility for his books.

The part of Moscow Centre most often referred to in Le Carré&#x27;s novels is the fictional Thirteenth Directorate headed by Karla, the code name for a case officer who has risen and fallen from political favour several times and was at one point &quot;blown&quot; by the British in the 1950s. Karla and George Smiley meet while Karla is in prison in Delhi, with Smiley trying to persuade Karla to defect during an interrogation in which Karla gives nothing away. Karla refuses these advances and eventually returns to favour in the USSR, masterminding the Witchcraft/Source Merlin operations supporting the mole Gerald in the Circus. Karla possesses a cigarette lighter given to Smiley by his wife, which he took during Smiley&#x27;s interrogation of him.

== Critical response ==
In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; written upon the novel&#x27;s release in 1974, critic Richard Locke called &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; &quot;fluently written,&quot; noting that &quot;it is full of vivid character sketches of secret agents and bureaucrats from all levels of British society, and the dialogue catches their voices well.&quot; He praised the novel&#x27;s realism, calling the detailing of &quot;the day to day activities of the intelligence service at home and abroad&quot; convincing. He noted that the &quot;scale and complexity of this novel are much greater than in any of Le Carré&#x27;s previous books,&quot; while the &quot;characterisation too has become much richer.&quot;

An article published in in-house Central Intelligence Agency journal &quot;Studies in Intelligence&quot;, presumably written by agents under pseudonyms, called it &quot;one of the most enduring renderings of the profession&quot;. It does question the &quot;organisational compression&quot; involved in the form of a large organisation, which the SIS would be, being reduced to a handful of senior operatives playing operational roles, but admits that this &quot;works very well at moving the story along in print.&quot; However, the idea that a major counter-intelligence operation could be run without the knowledge of counter-intelligence professionals, an allusion to Smiley&#x27;s investigation progressing in an undetected manner, is deemed an &quot;intellectual stretch.&quot;

John Powers of NPR has called it the greatest spy story ever told, noting that it &quot;offers the seductive fantasy of entering a secret world, one imagined with alluring richness.&quot; Le Carré himself considered the novel to be among his best works.

== In other media ==
=== Television ===

A TV adaptation of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; was made by the BBC in 1979. It is a seven-part serial and was released in September of that year. The series was directed by John Irvin, produced by Jonathan Powell, and stars Alec Guinness as George Smiley, with Ian Richardson as Bill Haydon. Ricki Tarr was played by Hywel Bennett. In the US, syndicated broadcasts and DVD releases compressed the seven-part UK episodes into six, by shortening scenes and altering the narrative sequence.

=== Radio ===
In 1988, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a dramatisation, by Rene Basilico, of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; in seven weekly half-hour episodes, produced by John Fawcett-Wilson. It is available as a BBC audiobook in CD and audio cassette formats. Notably, Bernard Hepton portrays George Smiley. Nine years earlier, he had portrayed Toby Esterhase in the television adaptation.

In 2009, BBC Radio 4 also broadcast new dramatisations, by Shaun McKenna, of the eight George Smiley novels by John le Carré, featuring Simon Russell Beale as Smiley. &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; was broadcast as three one-hour episodes, from Sunday 29 November to Sunday 13 December 2009, in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Classic Serial slot. The producer was Steven Canny. The series was repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra in June and July 2016, and has since been released as a boxed set by the BBC.

=== Film ===

Swedish director Tomas Alfredson made a film adaptation in 2011, based on a screenplay by Bridget O&#x27;Connor and Peter Straughan. The film was released in the UK and Ireland on 16 September 2011, and in the United States on 9 December 2011. It includes a cameo appearance by Le Carré in the Christmas party scene as the older man in the grey suit who stands suddenly to sing the Soviet anthem. The film received numerous Academy Award nominations, including a nomination for Best Actor for Gary Oldman for his role as George Smiley. The film also stars Colin Firth as Bill Haydon, Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam, Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr, and Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux.

=== Novel ===
Karen Abbott&#x27;s 2015 novel, a fictionalised account of the amateur spy work of four women, including Elizabeth Van Lew, during the American Civil War, is named &quot;Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy: Four Women Undercover in the Civil War,&quot; after le Carré&#x27;s Cold War thriller.

<doc id="638073" wikidata="Q1326803" url="?curid=638073" title="Umpqua River">
<text>The Umpqua River ( ) on the Pacific coast of Oregon in the United States is approximately long. One of the principal rivers of the Oregon Coast and known for bass and shad, the river drains an expansive network of valleys in the mountains west of the Cascade Range and south of the Willamette Valley, from which it is separated by the Calapooya Mountains. From its source northeast of Roseburg, the Umpqua flows northwest through the Oregon Coast Range and empties into the Pacific at Winchester Bay. The river and its tributaries flow almost entirely within Douglas County, which encompasses most of the watershed of the river from the Cascades to the coast. The &quot;Hundred Valleys of the Umpqua&quot; form the heart of the timber industry of southern Oregon, generally centered on Roseburg.

The Native Americans in the Umpqua&#x27;s watershed consist of several tribes, such as the Lower and Upper Umpqua (for which the river is named), and the Kalapuya. These tribes witnessed much of the Great Flood of 1862, during which the Umpqua and other rivers rose to levels so high that even the oldest natives had never seen a greater flood.

==Course==
The North Umpqua and South Umpqua rivers rise in the Southern Oregon Cascades, and flow generally west for over to join approximately northwest of Roseburg. In modern terminology, the &quot;Umpqua Valley&quot; is sometimes taken to refer to the populated lower reaches of the South Umpqua south of Roseburg, along the route of Interstate 5. The North Umpqua rises from snowmelt and is considered one of the premier summer steelhead streams in the West.

From Roseburg, the Umpqua flows generally northwest through broad farming valleys in the Oregon Coast Range in a serpentine course past the settlement of Umpqua and the city Elkton. At Elkton, it turns to flow west through a narrower canyon past Scottsburg, which is located at the head of tide. At this point, the Umpqua River becomes navigable. It enters Winchester Bay on the Pacific near Reedsport. It receives the Smith River from the north near its estuary on Winchester Bay. The Umpqua River Light protects ships nearing the mouth of the river.

The Umpqua is one of four major rivers in Oregon that start in or east of the Cascade Range and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Rogue River (in Oregon), Klamath River (flowing from Oregon to California) and Columbia River (flowing from British Columbia to Washington and the Pacific between Oregon and Washington). 

===Tributaries===
Named tributaries from source to mouth are the North Umpqua and South Umpqua rivers followed by Hidden Valley, Calapooya, Mill, Hubbard, and Rock creeks. Next come Bottle, Cougar, Wolf, Powell, Leonard, Basin, and Lost creeks followed by Galagher Canyon. Yellow Creek is next, then Deep Gulch and McGee, Waggoner, Martin, Brads, Williams, Whitehorse, Mehl, Fitzpatrick, and Heddin creeks.

Further downstream is Elk Creek then Grubbe, Hart, Beener, Gould, Sawyer, Paradise, Stony Brook, and Little Stony Brook creeks. Then come Scott, Butler, Lutsinger, Weatherly, Burchard, Golden, Wells, and Little Mill Creek. Mill Creek is next, followed by Luder, Charlotte, Franklin, Indian Charlie, Harvey, and Dean creeks. Entering the lower reaches are the Smith River and Scholfield, Providence, and Winchester creeks.

==History==
In the early 19th century, the Upper Umpqua tribe ceded most of its land to the U.S. government in the 1854 Treaty with the Umpqua and Kalapuya, agreeing to move to a reservation in Lincoln County as part of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz.

The Umpqua River valley was inhabited by several different bands of Indians: primarily the Athabaskan-speaking Upper Umpqua, Takelman speaking Cow Creek Band of Umpqua, the Yoncalla (a Kalapuyan people) in the north, and the Quich (Lower Umpqua) from Scottsburg/Wells Creek to the coast. The Quich (or Kuitsh) spoke a dialect of the Siuslaw language.

In the Great Flood of 1862, the Umpqua River had the largest flood known to all of the area&#x27;s Indians at the time, and water was higher than the 1853 flood. It rose from November 3 to December 3, subsided for two days then rose again until December 9. At Fort Umpqua, communication up river was cut off above Scottsburg, and the river was full of floating houses, barns, rails and produce. The Coquille River swept away settlers&#x27; property. Great damage also occurred on the Rogue River and on other small streams.

==Recreation==
The Umpqua River is a popular flyfishing and whitewater rafting destination. It has a high concentration of steelhead trout and is also home to salmon, sturgeon, bass, and shad. There are several campgrounds and RV parks on the Umpqua River, some of which offer riverfront RV camping, boat ramps, fish cleaning stations, and hot showers for guests to use.

<text>William Arthur O&#x27;Donnell (born May 4, 1948 in Springhill, Nova Scotia) is a Canadian harness racing driver.

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s parents, Etta and Henry, were both heavily involved in the local racing circuit. After graduating from high school, he became second trainer for Jim Doherty, and moved to Saratoga Springs, New York, where in 1979 he set the all-time record for most wins (269) at a single track in a single season. Later he went to the Meadowlands in New Jersey on the Grand Circuit.

O&#x27;Donnell was given the nickname the &quot;Magic Man&quot; for being able to drive a horse seemingly past its limitations. In 1982 and 1984 he was voted the Harness Tracks of America Driver of the Year award. In 1984 he also set a yearly earnings record of over $9 million. In a race in 1984 with Nihilator, O&#x27;Donnell was the first to post a sub-1:50 race mile in the $2,161,000 Woodrow Wilson Pace, the richest race ever contested to that point.&quot; It was the first time that William O&#x27;Donnell had ever driven the son of Niatross. Bill O&#x27;Donnell won the driving title, his third in four years. The next year, he became harness racing&#x27;s first driver to eclipse $10 million in earnings in a single year.

O&#x27;Donnell has 5,742 lifetime victories as a driver with just under $100 million earned by the horses he has guided. A native of Springhill, Nova Scotia, he was the leading driver at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, for many years and established a number of records with respect to wins and earnings.

In 2001, O&#x27;Donnell moved back to Canada, settling in Acton, Ontario, to focus more on training horses. Since then, he has also become involved in the politics of racing, giving much of his time and considerable expertise to several horsemen&#x27;s groups. He currently serves as President of the Central Ontario Standardbred Association, which has the racing contract with the largest track operator in Canada, Woodbine Entertainment Group. In addition, he serves as the representative for Standardbred horse people on the board of the Ontario Horse Racing Industry Association as well as a Vice-President of the Ontario Standardbred Adoption Society. He has four children, Faith, Christopher, Megan, and Sean.

Bill O&#x27;Donnell has been inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame (1992), the Nova Scotia Sports Hall of Fame, the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (1986), and the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in Goshen, NY (1991).

<text>Pla de l&#x27;Estany () is a comarca (county) in the Girona region in Catalonia, Spain. Its name means &quot;plain of the lake&quot;, the lake in question being the Lake of Banyoles. Banyoles is also the name of the capital of the comarca and home to over half of its people. Pla de l&#x27;Estany was established as a separate comarca in 1988 on the basis of a referendum; prior to that it had constituted the northwest part of the comarca of Gironès. The comarca borders the comarques of Garrotxa, Alt Empordà, and Gironès.

Pla de l&#x27;Estany is largely agricultural, but has also long had industries in textiles, furniture, leather, iron, and copper.

<doc id="638081" wikidata="Q5280343" url="?curid=638081" title="Direct impingement">
<text>Direct impingement is a type of gas operation for a firearm that utilizes gas from a fired cartridge to impart force on the bolt carrier or slide assembly to cycle the action. Firearms using direct impingement are theoretically lighter, more accurate, and less expensive than firearms using cleaner and cooler gas piston systems.

== Advantages ==
Firearms with a direct impingement design can, in principle, be constructed lighter than piston-operated designs. Because high-pressure gas acts directly upon the bolt and carrier in a direct impingement system, it does not need a separate gas cylinder, piston, and operating rod assembly of a conventional piston-operated system, only requiring a gas tube to channel gas from the barrel back towards the action. This saves weight, lowers manufacturing costs, and reduces the mass of the operating parts, and thereby the wear on mechanical parts due to movement. By removing the gas piston, the potential amount of moving mass is also lowered, decreasing the potential for firearm movement and barrel distortion before the bullet leaves the barrel.

The gas directed at the bolt carrier group may improve reliability in some conditions. The jet of gas can blow debris away from the ejection port which, in other designs, could enter the mechanism and foul the gun.

== Disadvantages ==
The main disadvantage of direct impingement is that the breech of the firing mechanism becomes fouled more quickly compared to long or short stroke piston systems. This is caused by the operating mechanism&#x27;s direct exposure to gases from burned cartridge propellant when the firearm cycles. The gases contain vaporized metals, carbon, and impurities in a gaseous state until they condense on the relatively cooler operating parts. These deposits increase friction on the bolt&#x27;s camming system, leading to malfunctions. Frequent and thorough cleaning is required to ensure reliability. The amount of fouling depends upon the rifle&#x27;s design as well as the type of propellant powder used.

Another disadvantage of direct impingement is that combustion gases heat the bolt and bolt carrier as the firearm operates. This heating causes lubricant to be &quot;burned off&quot;. Lack of proper lubrication is the most common cause of weapon malfunctions. These combined factors reduce service life of these parts, reliability, and mean time between failures.

== Variables ==
The operation of the system is highly dependent on both the length of the barrel and the gas tube which transports gas from the barrel to the bolt. Using too short a gas tube can result in increased pressure inside the bolt assembly and an increased rate of automatic fire, both of which can negatively affect the weapon and accuracy of shots. The use of a suppressor also increases gas pressure, further aggravating the situation. The problem can be reduced by using a longer gas tube, moving the gas port on the barrel further forward, and/or by installing an adjustable gas block to provide the right amount of gas pressure depending on the desired operating mode.

==History==
The first experimental rifle using a direct impingement system was the French Rossignol ENT B1 automatic rifle followed by Rossignol&#x27;s B2, B4 and B5. The first successful production weapon was the French MAS 40 rifle adopted in March 1940. The Swedish Automatgevär m/42 is another example. Both the French and Swedish rifles use a simple system whereby the gas tube acts as a piston with a cylinder recess in the bolt carrier.

===Stoner bolt and carrier piston system===
The original AR-10 action designed by Eugene Stoner (later developed into the ArmaLite AR-15, M16 rifle, and M4 carbine) is commonly called a direct impingement system, but it does not actually utilize this mechanism. In , the designer states: &quot;This invention is a true expanding gas system instead of the conventional impinging gas system.&quot; Gas is routed from a port in the barrel through a gas tube, directly to a chamber inside the bolt carrier. The bolt within the bolt carrier is fitted with piston rings to contain the gas. In effect, the bolt and carrier act as a gas piston and cylinder. The subtleties involved in ArmaLite&#x27;s patent on the gas system significantly diverge from classical direct impingement; upon firing, the pressurized propellant gasses exit the barrel via the gas port and travel the length of the gas tube, but instead of simply applying the inertia necessary to cycle the weapon directly to the bolt carrier, the gas is funneled inside the bolt carrier, wherein the increase in pressure results in the bolt itself acting as a piston, forcing the bolt carrier away from the barrel face. The Stoner bolt and carrier piston system is ammunition specific since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior.

Carroll had a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Mary&#x27;s University (1965) and a Bachelor of Education from York University (1989). She was a partner in a small manufacturing and retail business.

==Politics==
===Municipal===
Carroll began her career in politics as a Barrie City councillor, representing the downtown Barrie ward.

===Federal===
In 1997, Carroll won the Liberal nomination for the newly created riding of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford. She went on to win the 1997 election by 7,507 votes, and was re-elected again in 2000. She was elected in 2004 in the newly created riding of Barrie.

Carroll served as Parliamentary Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2001 to 2003. Carroll was appointed as Minister for International Cooperation, responsible for the Canadian International Development Agency, when Paul Martin became Prime Minister on December 12, 2003. She was the first, and to date only, federal cabinet minister from Barrie. She retained that portfolio until the Liberals were defeated in 2006, when she lost her seat to her 2004 challenger Patrick Brown.

Carroll was a supporter of Paul Martin&#x27;s leadership bid leading up to the 2003 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election. Carroll supported Michael Ignatieff during the 2006 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, serving as his Ontario campaign co-chair with former DFAIT cabinet colleague Jim Peterson.

<doc id="638088" wikidata="Q3182576" url="?curid=638088" title="John Taylor (rugby union, born 1945)">
<text>John Taylor (born 21 July 1945) is a Welsh former rugby union player and current commentator. Nicknamed &quot;Basil Brush&quot; thanks to his wild hair and beard, he was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, and played as a flanker for London Welsh (he later became co-President with former teammate, John Dawes), and represented Wales 26 times between 1967 and 1973.

==Rugby career==

===Playing===
Perhaps Taylor&#x27;s most famous moment was in the Five Nations match against Scotland in 1971. The match had see-sawed backwards and forwards with each team taking the lead several times. With a few minutes to go and the score at 18-14, Wales won a line-out on the Scotland 22 metre line. The ball moved through the backs to Gerald Davies who managed to squeeze in to score a try at the right hand corner. The Scottish defence kept up the chase to prevent Davies from touching down near the posts. With the score at 18-17 and ball to be placed on the right hand side, the conversion looked almost impossible, particularly as Barry John, the usual Welsh kicker, had been concussed earlier in the match. Instead, Taylor took the conversion attempt and kicked the ball perfectly between the posts. The final score was 19-18, giving Wales the victory. One Welsh journalist called this &quot;the greatest conversion since Saint Paul&quot;.

John Taylor played for the British and Irish Lions on the 1971 tour to New Zealand, playing in all 4 Tests.

===Apartheid===
He was notable for the stand he took against apartheid after visiting South Africa in 1968, after being selected for the 1968 British Lions tour to South Africa. Taylor was invited on the subsequent 1974 Lions tour to that country but made it clear he would follow his conscience and he refused to tour. He also refused to play against the South Africans during their 1969-1970 Tour of Britain and Ireland. It was Taylor&#x27;s refusal to face the South Africans for Wales in 1970 that cost him a place with the Barbarians. After Mervyn Davies fell ill before the classic 1973 Barbarian encounter against the All Blacks, Taylor&#x27;s name was suggested as a replacement. It is alleged that the club secretary for the Barbarians, Brigadier Glyn Hughes, responded negatively to the idea with the response &quot;He&#x27;s not playing. The man&#x27;s a Communist!&quot;

===Activities after retiring===
Since 1991, he has been the lead rugby commentator on ITV Sport, describing the World Cup final victory of England over Australia on 22 November 2003. He retired from ITV after the 2007 Rugby World Cup and commentated for TalkSport on the 2011 RWC in New Zealand.

Throughout the 2015 Rugby World Cup, hosted by England in September and October but also including games at Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium in Wales, Taylor was the stadium announcer for matches played at Twickenham Stadium, London. He worked at every RWC through to 2015 and has worked on every Lions Tour since 1983.

<text>James Scott Peterson (July 30, 1941 – May 10, 2024) was a Canadian politician. He was a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1980 to 1984 and again from 1988 to 2007, representing the northern Toronto riding of Willowdale. He served in the cabinets of Jean Chrétien, as Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), and Paul Martin, as Minister of International Trade.

==Personal background==
Born in Ottawa, Ontario, he had a Doctor of Civil Law in International Law from McGill University, a Master of Laws from Columbia University, and a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Western Ontario. As well, he had diplomas from Hague Academy of International Law in The Hague and La Sorbonne in Paris.

Peterson was one of three sons of Clarence and Laura Marie Peterson, who were both from Saskatchewan. They moved to Ontario during the Great Depression where Clarence worked as a salesman for several years before establishing a wholesale electronics business, C.M. Peterson Co. Ltd, in 1944 in London. He was elected an alderman on London City Council in the early 1950s and was the provincial Liberal candidate in London North in 1955 against future Premier of Ontario John Robarts, and again as a federal Liberal candidate in 1963 in London. 

Both of Jim Peterson&#x27;s brothers entered politics; David Peterson served as premier of Ontario from 1985 to 1990, while Tim Peterson served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2007, first as a Liberal and later as a Progressive Conservative.

Peterson was married to Heather (née Johnston) Peterson, who served as a regional liaison officer in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office of Pierre Trudeau and as the national director of John Turner&#x27;s successful 1984 leadership campaign. The couple were married for over 60 years, until his death, and first met in high school when they were 13 years old. They married when they were both 21. 
Peterson and his wife first came to public attention in 1974 when they helped ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov defect from the Soviet Union during a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet in Toronto.

Prior to entering politics, Peterson practiced international law and taught at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. He had also consulted for the United Nations Development Programme in Malaysia and Sudan.

==Politics==
As a member of Parliament in the House of Commons he represented the riding of Willowdale in Toronto. Peterson ran as a candidate for the Liberal Party in the 1979 election but was defeated. He ran again in the 1980 election and won. He served as a backbencher under Pierre Trudeau and as a parliamentary secretary from 1981 to 1983. As parliamentary secretary to then justice minister Jean Chrétien, Peterson helped pass Criminal Code of Canada reforms that made it easier to prosecute sexual assault, allowed a victim&#x27;s partner to be charged, and restricted the admissibility of a victim&#x27;s sexual history in court, and ended the requirement that rape must be reported immediately as a requirement for charges to be laid.

He supported John Turner&#x27;s successful bid to succeed Trudeau in the 1984 Liberal leadership contest (for which his wife Heather served as campaign director) but lost his seat in the 1984 election. He was returned to Parliament in the 1988 election and was re-elected in each subsequent election until his retirement in 2007.

Peterson was mentioned as a potential candidate during the 1990 Liberal leadership contest, but opted to support Paul Martin. When the Liberals returned to power under Jean Chrétien, Peterson served as the chair of the standing committee on Finance.

In 1997, Chrétien appointed him to the Ministry as the Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), but Peterson was sent back to the backbench in 2002. He returned to serve in the cabinet of Paul Martin, whom Peterson had long supported.

Peterson was mentioned as a potential interim leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, following the resignation of Paul Martin; however, Bill Graham was named to the position. Peterson did not take a critic&#x27;s portfolio in the Liberal Party&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet formed by Graham or by Martin&#x27;s permanent successor, Stéphane Dion. He and his brother David had supported Michael Ignatieff instead of Dion for the Liberal Party leadership in 2006, with Jim Peterson serving as Ignatieff&#x27;s Ontario campaign co-chair with former DFAIT cabinet colleague Aileen Carroll.

On March 8, 2007, Peterson announced that he would not be a candidate in the next federal election. Former Liberal Party of Canada leadership candidate Martha Hall Findlay was appointed as the Liberal candidate in his riding. On June 20, 2007, he announced his resignation from the House of Commons, which took effect July 2.

==Post political life==
On November 20, 2007, Peterson joined the international law firm of Fasken Martineau DuMoulin as counsel. The following month, Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Economic Development and Trade Sandra Pupatello appointed Peterson as Ontario&#x27;s chief negotiator in the Quebec/Ontario trade, investment and labour mobility negotiations. In 2017, Ontario&#x27;s Natural Resources Minister, Kathryn McGarry, appointed Peterson as Ontario&#x27;s chief negotiator in the ongoing softwood lumber dispute between Canada and the United States.

Peterson died from a heart attack at his farm near Orangeville, Ontario, on May 10, 2024, at the age of 82.

<doc id="638092" wikidata="Q3086948" url="?curid=638092" title="Fred Rose (politician)">
<text>Fred Rose (born Fishel Rosenberg; 7 December 1907 – 16 March 1983) was a Polish-Canadian politician and trade union organizer, best known for being the only member of the Canadian Parliament to ever be convicted of a charge related to spying for a foreign country. A member of the Communist Party of Canada and Labor-Progressive Party, he served as the MP for Cartier from 1943 to 1947. He was ousted from his seat after being found guilty of conspiring to steal weapons research for the Soviet Union.

Shortly after his release from prison, Rose moved to Poland to start an import-export business. While there, his Canadian citizenship was revoked, which prevented him from returning to Canada. His appeal against the revoking of his citizenship ultimately failed, but in 1958, then Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Ellen Fairclough introduced the &quot;Fred Rose amendment&quot; to the Citizenship Act so that such a removal of Canadian citizenship could never happen again.

==Early life==
Rose was born to a Polish Jewish family in Lublin, which was then part of the Russian Empire and now is in Poland. One of the six children in the family, he attended the &quot;Gymnase Humaniste de Lublin,&quot; a Jewish high school in which he learned to speak French. He emigrated to Canada as a child in 1920, where he attended Baron Byng High School.

==Communism==
In 1925, he became involved with the Young Communist League of Canada and then joined the Communist Party of Canada while he was working in a canning factory. By 1928, he became a person of interest for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In April 1931, he published the pamphlet &quot;Smash the Embargo&quot; in which he made his political goals clear. In his view, the Communist Party of Canada was to &quot;lead the Canadian workers to establish a system similar to that of the Soviet Union.&quot;

Rose was jailed during the 1930s for sedition, and won the hatred of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis for writing about the close connections between the Duplessis government and the fascist governments of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. He was a close associate of Norman Bethune, a doctor who had aided antifascist and communist fighters first in Spain during the Spanish Civil War and later in China.

==Electoral career==

He was a candidate for the Communist Party of Canada in the working-class riding of Cartier, in the Montreal area in the 1935 federal election, coming in second with 16.28% of the votes. He ran in the 1936 Quebec general election in the riding of Montréal–Saint-Louis for the Communist Party of Quebec and came in third, at 16.8%.

In the early stages of World War II, the Communist Party of Canada was formally banned, and many of its leaders interned by the Padlock Law. After a major public campaign, the party was legally reorganized as the Labor-Progressive Party.

Rose ran as a Labor-Progressive candidate in a 1943 by-election in the federal riding of Cartier. He won with 30% of the vote in a tight four-way race, beating David Lewis of the social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and two others. He was the first, and, remains the only, Communist Party MP elected in Canada.

Rose was re-elected in the 1945 election with 40% of the vote. Most of the riding&#x27;s immigrant Jewish population voted for Rose, who benefitted from the perception that the Soviet Union was the main hope for saving Europe&#x27;s Jews from Hitler. Rose&#x27;s main rival, Paul Massé, of the antiwar Bloc Populaire, who came second, was supported by most French-Canadians.

As a Member of Parliament, Rose proposed the first federal medicare legislation and the first anti-hate legislation.

==Gouzenko affair==
Rose was caught up in the world political sea change following World War II, when the Soviet Union, a major wartime ally, was now perceived as an enemy in the new reality of the Cold War. Igor Gouzenko, a young cipher clerk in the Soviet embassy in Ottawa, was recalled to his homeland in July 1945. Rather than return home, Gouzenko defected with documents in September 1945 and claimed to have evidence of a massive Soviet spy ring operating in Canada and the United States.

Few took Gouzenko&#x27;s accusations and evidence seriously at first. A royal commission of inquiry, the Kellock–Taschereau Commission, was ultimately established by the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in February 1946 to investigate Gouzenko&#x27;s evidence. Headed by two Supreme Court justices, Roy Kellock and Robert Taschereau, the commission arrested and sequestered Canadians named in Gouzenko&#x27;s documents without legal counsel and barred them from all contact with the outside world until they were summoned before the commission.

Rose was alleged to lead the ring of up to 20 Soviet spies, which were targeting primarily atomic weapon research from the Manhattan Project. Raymond Boyer, an alleged co-conspirator, testified that Rose was involved in the operation. Rose refused to testify before the commission, which he said was designed to &quot;smear honest and patriotic Canadians.&quot; Rose was ultimately found guilty of conspiring to turn over information about the explosive RDX to the Soviets, and was sentenced to six years in prison, a term just one day longer than was required to deprive him of his elected seat in the House of Commons.

Rose wrote to Speaker Gaspard Fauteux from St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary on 24 January 1947:
Mr. Speaker: If the will of the people is to prevail, if justice is to be done, there can be no question of my expulsion from the house. To the contrary, I should be in my seat in the House of Commons and not in the penitentiary. Parliament is the highest of Courts. Through its actions in my case it will decide whether hysteria is to continue or whether reason and justice are to prevail. Respectfully, Fred Rose, M.P.
His letter was returned to him unread, and on 30 January 1947, he was formally expelled from the House of Commons.

==Later life==
Rose was released from prison in 1951 after four-and-a-half years. Attempting to find work in Montreal, he was tailed from jobsite to jobsite by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which pointed out to employers and workmates that he was a convicted spy.

In 1953 he went to Poland to attempt to set up an import-export business and to obtain health treatment that he could not afford in Canada. He worked for many years as English-language editor of &quot;Poland&quot;, a magazine of Polish culture and civilization designed for sale in the West. While he lived in Poland, his Canadian citizenship was revoked in 1957, and he was unable to return to Canada to lead the fight to clear his name.

His appeal against revoking his citizenship was denied, although Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Ellen Fairclough introduced the so-called &quot;Fred Rose amendment&quot; in 1958 to the Citizenship Act so that such a removal of Canadian citizenship could never happen again. Years later, former federal cabinet minister Allan MacEachen acknowledged that the pages of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s diary dealing with Rose had gone missing, as had most of the other records dealing with his case.

Rose died on 16 March 1983 in Warsaw, having never returned to Canada.

<doc id="638093" wikidata="Q1054270" url="?curid=638093" title="Rerun Van Pelt">
<text>Rerun Van Pelt is Linus and Lucy&#x27;s younger brother in Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Lucy Van Pelt, his sister, disparagingly calls the situation a &quot;rerun&quot; of the birth of her brother Linus, so Linus nicknames the child &quot;Rerun&quot;. Despite Lucy&#x27;s disappointment, she becomes a warm and protective older sister.

Rerun was a minor character in the strip when he was introduced in 1972, and in the 1980s he mostly appeared in sequences riding on the back of his mother&#x27;s bicycle. However, in the late 1990s — the final years of the strip — he became a major presence, as Schulz felt that his main cast was &quot;too old&quot; for some of the themes he wanted to explore. In a 1997 interview in &quot;Comics Journal&quot;, Schulz admitted, &quot;Lately, Rerun has almost taken over the strip.&quot;

Rerun made his first appearance in animation in the 1976 special &quot;It&#x27;s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown&quot;, voiced by Vinnie Dow. He returned in the 1983 special &quot;It&#x27;s an Adventure, Charlie Brown&quot; and the 1983–1986 series &quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&quot;, voiced by Jason Mendelson, the four-year-old son of producer Bill Mendelson. Rerun was the main character in the 2003 special &quot;I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown&quot;, with a storyline drawn from the strip&#x27;s Rerun-heavy final years. He also has an important role in the 2006 special &quot;He&#x27;s a Bully, Charlie Brown&quot;.

==Description==
Rerun bears a strong physical resemblance to Linus. In appearances from the 1970s and 1980s, Rerun is virtually identical to Linus, though he is smaller, wore a plain T-shirt (it appears that he got many hand-me-downs from Linus, as he wore a long-sleeved shirt with Linus&#x27;s shirt design), and his hair sprang up. Rerun&#x27;s appearance evolved in the 1990s, as he aged beyond infancy. Rerun was mostly shown wearing overalls, and his hair was shown as shorter and flatter. While he continued to share Linus&#x27; facial features, Rerun&#x27;s head also grew rounder and larger in proportion to his body. In his early TV appearances, he wears a green or white shirt with black shorts and saddle shoes. In &quot;I Want A Dog For Christmas, Charlie Brown&quot;, he wears an orange striped shirt under light blue overalls.

==Development==
Rerun started as a minor character in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; universe, only becoming a main character in the last decade of the comic strip. Rerun was first mentioned in the strip on May 23, 1972, during a storyline in which Lucy throws her younger brother Linus out of the house, only to relent when she learns that yet another little brother had just been born.

Initially, toddler Rerun was shown playing cards with an equally confused Snoopy, and learning to tie his shoes from Lucy.

For many years, Rerun was only seen perched in a seat on the back of his mother&#x27;s bicycle, wryly commenting on his mother&#x27;s riding skills and habits. Schulz, a careful observer of ordinary life, was inspired by the sight of young children strapped down for transport. &quot;You look at these little kids hanging on to their elders...&quot; he said, &quot;and you wonder what goes through their minds.&quot; Rerun was &quot;a kind of interpreter to those silent thoughts and impressions. The absence of parents and adults in the comic strip means that Rerun must face his trials alone. One critic writes, &quot;Mrs. Van Pelt exposes Rerun to the harsher truths of the outside world. He has to fend for himself in fighting off dogs, handle burdens like her purchases, and deal with setbacks in life, such as potholes. Perhaps she wants to prepare Rerun for the cruelties and failures that Charlie Brown&#x27;s gang frequently encounters. After all, his older brother, Linus, basically hides under a blanket.&quot;

In 1976, Rerun made his first animated appearance in the special &quot;It&#x27;s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown&quot;, in a sequence on the back of his mother&#x27;s bicycle.

He was rarely used in the 1980s; by that time, Schulz had run out of ideas about how to use him. &quot;Rerun is still around,&quot; Schulz said in a 1984 interview promoting &quot;It&#x27;s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown&quot;. &quot;He rides on the back of his mom&#x27;s bicycle now and then, and we&#x27;re going to use him on some of the Saturday morning television shows but I just... run out of ideas on certain subjects, and lately I haven&#x27;t been able to think of anything where he is on the back of his mom&#x27;s bicycle. But he&#x27;s still around.&quot;

In the 1990s, Schulz began using Rerun as an opportunity to explore the grandparent/grandchild relationship. Rerun attends his first day of school on September 11, 1996, having spent the previous week hiding under the bed. Rerun ages to 5 years old at this point, still younger than most of the strip&#x27;s other characters. In a 1997 interview, Schulz said, &quot;We had a few grandchildren who had to start preschool and kindergarten, and I see little kids at the arena, too. I began to get some ideas and so he was the perfect one to have start kindergarten. He&#x27;s different from Lucy and Linus. He&#x27;s a little more outspoken. And I think he&#x27;s going to be a little on the strange side... [laughs] the way he is already. I just had him expelled from school for another day recently, just because he spoke up... He&#x27;s perfect for that. The other kids are too old for this, really.&quot;

One of Rerun&#x27;s major concerns at this time is his desire for a dog; he sees Snoopy as an ideal companion, but the dog has no particular regard for him.

Rerun&#x27;s real name is never revealed. In the September 11, 1996 strip when he first starts school, it is suggested that even he himself doesn&#x27;t know what it is—he tells his (off-screen) teacher &quot;Yes ma&#x27;am, my name is &#x27;Rerun&#x27;...I don&#x27;t know...That&#x27;s what they all call me.&quot;

In the final years of the strip — also the final years of Schulz&#x27;s life — Schulz used Rerun as a way to express his ambivalence about his own talents and limitations. In a sequence in January 1999, the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters visit an art museum. In one single-panel wordless strip, the other children gaze at a large oil painting of a landscape, while Rerun, alone at the far right, looks at a small line drawing of the dog from Patrick McDonnell&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Mutts&quot;. Despite this symbolic assertion that comic strips are equivalent to other forms of art, the next day&#x27;s strip finds Rerun back in school, struggling with his own watercolor. &quot;I think I learned something very important,&quot; he tells his classmate. &quot;I&#x27;ll never be Andrew Wyeth.&quot; One critic says that &quot;here, Rerun is parroting Schulz&#x27;s own self-deprecating attitude toward his own medium, comic art.&quot;

Ever the enigma, Rerun draws a curtain over &quot;Peanuts&quot;&#x27; final installment of the annual ritual of Lucy pulling the football away just as Charlie Brown tries to place-kick it. In the 1999 Sunday strip, Rerun tells Lucy that their mother wants her to come home for lunch, and she leaves him to hold the football. Charlie Brown rushes toward the ball — but the audience never sees whether he successfully kicks it or not. Lucy returns and asks Rerun what happened, and he replies, &quot;You&#x27;ll never know.&quot; As one critic remarks, &quot;Rerun&#x27;s presence disrupts the repetitive force of the gag,&quot; replacing certainty in this climactic strip with &quot;inexhaustible possibility.&quot;

==In adaptations==
===Television===
Rerun&#x27;s animated debut is in the animated television special &quot;It&#x27;s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown&quot;, and his first major appearance in the strip was adapted in the first produced episode of &quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&quot;. Rerun only made one other appearance in a television special before 2000, &quot;Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!&quot; from 1986, where his attempts to blow up balloons for the New Year&#x27;s party ended in failure, as he blew them up as cubes rather than spheres (a scenario adapted from a comic strip story involving Linus from December 1954, when Linus was roughly the same age). Rerun was mentioned, but not seen, in the 1985 special &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Getting Married, Charlie Brown&quot; when Charlie Brown informed Snoopy that he could not back out of his wedding, because Rerun had already been chosen as ring-bearer.

Rerun was given a speaking role in the 2002 special &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s Christmas Tales&quot;. He was the main character in the 2003 special &quot;I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown&quot;, with a storyline drawn from the strip&#x27;s Rerun-heavy final years. He also has an important role in the 2006 special &quot;He&#x27;s a Bully, Charlie Brown&quot;.

He was not seen or mentioned in the 2015 film &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, although a drawing of him can be seen during the credits.

Various actors have voiced the animated Rerun since 1976, including Vinny Dow, Jason Mendelson, Timmy Deters, and Jimmy Bennett.

===Voiced by===
*Vinnie Dow (1976)
*Jason Mendelson (1983–1986) (as Jason Muller)
*Tim Deters (2002) (as Timmy Deters)
*Jimmy Bennett (2003, 2006) (as James Bennett)
*Finn Carr (2016)
*Milo Toriel-McGibbon (2019)

===Stage===

Neither of the Broadway productions of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; and &quot;Snoopy! The Musical&quot; (aside from a cameo in the animated adaptation) featured Rerun, but various local and regional productions have included Rerun as a character.

<text>Joseph Keyshawn Johnson (born July 22, 1972) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons.

He played college football for the USC Trojans, and earned All-American honors twice. He was selected first overall by the New York Jets in the 1996 NFL draft. He also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys, and Carolina Panthers. He was one of three wide receivers to be taken first overall in NFL draft history and the most recent. During his tenure with the Buccaneers, Johnson was a member of the team that won Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003.

He retired from football following the 2006 season, and spent seven years as a television broadcaster for the sports channel ESPN. He was one of the co-hosts of the FS1 weekday morning debate show &quot;Undisputed&quot; with Richard Sherman, Michael Irvin, and Skip Bayless. He has since joined Paul Pierce and Joy Taylor to co-host the FS1 weekday show &quot;Speak&quot;.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Los Angeles, California. He attended Palisades High School for his sophomore and junior years and then Susan Miller Dorsey High School, also in Los Angeles, for his senior year. Though a standout prospect at football, Johnson&#x27;s early life was plagued by gang crime and legal troubles. In eighth grade, he spent nine months in a California youth facility after being arrested for possession of marijuana, cocaine, and a concealed handgun. His low SAT scores forced him to start his college football career in community college.

==College career==
In Johnson&#x27;s first year at West Los Angeles College, he lasted just 8 games. Eventually he just stopped showing up for practice. &quot;For years, I was the good kid, but I was curious and it eventually got the best of me,&quot; he later wrote. &quot;I started hanging out with the wrong crowd and got myself into trouble.&quot; After sitting out the following year to get his affairs in order, Johnson returned to football in 1992, and performed well enough to earn himself a transfer to University of Southern California, where he played for coach John Robinson&#x27;s USC Trojans football team in 1994 and 1995. In 1994, he finished with 66 catches for 1,362 yards and 9 touchdowns. In 1995, he finished with 102 catches for 1,434 yards and 7 touchdowns.

As a Trojan, he was twice recognized as an All-American selection. After the 1994 college season, Johnson helped lead the Trojans to a win in the 1995 Cotton Bowl Classic, after which he was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. The Trojans then played in the 1996 Rose Bowl, during which Johnson caught 12 passes for a Rose Bowl record 216 yards and one touchdown in the Trojans&#x27; 41–32 victory over the Northwestern Wildcats. He was named the Player of the Game. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame on December 31, 2008.

While in college, Johnson appeared on the TV show &quot;Coach&quot;, as a player eligible for draft in the upcoming season. He flatly refused to be recruited to the fictional &quot;Orlando Breakers&quot; team for coach Hayden Fox, stating he would go to Canada to play first. Johnson graduated from USC with a B.A. in social sciences and history in 1997.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===New York Jets===
The New York Jets drafted Johnson with the first overall pick in the 1996 NFL draft. He was the third wide receiver selected with the number one overall pick since Irving Fryar was chosen by the New England Patriots in 1984. While in New York, he played three seasons (1997–1999) under Bill Parcells, who in two seasons would turnaround the Jets from 1–15 in 1996, Johnson&#x27;s rookie year, to 9–7 in 1997, and 12–4 in 1998 and the franchise&#x27;s first ever AFC East Division title.

One of his best performances was in a 34–24 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in an AFC divisional playoff game after the 1998 season. In that game, Johnson caught nine passes for 121 yards and a touchdown, rushed for 28 yards and a touchdown, recovered a fumble, and intercepted a pass on defense. The Jets however, fell one game short of the Super Bowl after losing the AFC Championship Game the next week to the Denver Broncos 23–10. Johnson wrote an autobiography with ESPN&#x27;s Shelley Smith, &quot;Just Give Me the Damn Ball&quot;. The book covered his rookie year experiences.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Johnson was traded on April 12, 2000, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for two first round draft choices (13th – John Abraham – and 27th – Anthony Becht – overall) in the 2000 NFL draft. Soon after Johnson arrived in Tampa Bay, they signed him to an 8-year, $56 million contract extension with the Buccaneers that made him the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL.

At that time he was joining a team that had fallen one game short of the Super Bowl the previous season. In 2002 Johnson went on to win a Super Bowl with the Buccaneers after the arrival of new head coach Jon Gruden, who succeeded Tony Dungy. Johnson had 76 catches for 1,088 yards and five touchdowns; in the playoffs, he had eight catches for 125 yards and a touchdown against the Eagles, then had six grabs for 69 yards in the Super Bowl. However, his bitter relationship with Gruden (illustrated by a video clip of him yelling at Gruden on the sidelines) led to his de-activation for the final 7 games of the 2003 season. The following offseason, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys, where he was reunited with Bill Parcells, his coach while he was with the New York Jets.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On March 19, 2004, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers traded him to the Dallas Cowboys for Joey Galloway, who the Cowboys had also traded two first round picks to acquire. Reunited with his former coach Bill Parcells, Johnson lived up to his advance billing for the Cowboys in 2004, leading the team in receiving yards and tying for the lead in touchdown catches while taking over a leadership role in the locker room and on the field. On March 16, 2006, the Cowboys released Johnson to make room for recently acquired receiver Terrell Owens.

===Carolina Panthers===
On March 23, 2006, Johnson signed a four-year, $14-million-dollar deal with the Carolina Panthers. Of this, he was guaranteed a $5 million signing bonus. He was expected to play opposite Steve Smith as the number two receiver.

During the Carolina Panthers&#x27; &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Buccaneers on November 13, 2006, Johnson became the first player in NFL history to score a touchdown on Monday Night Football with four teams (Jets, Buccaneers, Cowboys and Panthers). Johnson was released from the Panthers on May 1, 2007, after just one season with the team. He posted 70 receptions for 815 yards and four touchdowns in Carolina.

==Retirement and legacy==
On May 23, 2007, Johnson announced he was retiring from the NFL, reportedly turning down offers by several teams, including the Tennessee Titans. Titans&#x27; Head Coach Jeff Fisher, who became friends with Johnson while he played at USC, said he thought Johnson&#x27;s numbers and production spoke for themselves: &quot;He still played at a high-level last year. He takes very good care of himself,&quot; Fisher said. &quot;He hasn&#x27;t had any injuries per season. Anytime you get a chance to bring an experienced veteran in to add to your roster then it&#x27;s a good thing.&quot; On the same day, Johnson announced he would be working as an analyst for ESPN.

On February 5, 2008, CBS4 Miami reported that Bill Parcells reached out to Johnson. Parcells reportedly told him if he was to come out of retirement there would be a spot on the Miami Dolphins roster for him.

His all-around game has earned him selection to the Pro Bowl three times – 1998 and 1999 with the N.Y. Jets and 2001 with Tampa Bay. Johnson finished his career with 814 receptions, tying him at 17th all-time with Henry Ellard for career NFL receptions. His 10,571 yards receiving is the 24th highest total in NFL history. In reaching the 600 career receptions plateau in 118 games, he tied Herman Moore for the second fewest games needed in NFL history to reach that mark, and he became one of only three players in league history (Moore and Marvin Harrison) to reach 600 receptions in fewer than 120 games. He caught 512 passes in his first 100 games to rank as the fourth most receptions in a player&#x27;s first 100 games. The other three are: Marvin Harrison (591), Sterling Sharpe (524), and Lionel Taylor (516).

To achieve this production, he has averaged 74.8 catches-per-season over his first nine seasons, and caught a pass in every one of his 135 games played over this span. This accomplishment was the second longest streak among active receivers (Harrison, 139) and the third longest streak to begin a career among all players (Marshall Faulk, 158 and Harrison, 139) at that time. For his career, Johnson recorded 60 or more catches in ten of his eleven NFL seasons. In 2001 and 2002, he became the first player in Buccaneers history to record consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons when he registered 1,266 yards in 2001 and 1,098 in 2002. Johnson missed only three of a possible 145 career games – including playoffs – due to injury.

===Jersey number===
Arguably, Johnson&#x27;s biggest legacy in the NFL has been of the league to loosen up its jersey number policy, wearing number 19 throughout his career despite the fact that it generally wasn&#x27;t permissible during most of his career. Entering his rookie training camp with the Jets, Johnson wore number 19 due to all the 80s numbers at the time being used, but was allowed to keep 19 once the regular season started despite 80s numbers becoming available after the final cut downs. He continued to wear 19 with the Buccaneers despite also having 80s numbers available; the NFL permitted it despite Johnson not also playing a position eligible for number 19 such as quarterback, since it wasn&#x27;t within the 50-79 range that is reserved for offensive lineman and needed for those positions for eligible receiver-based reasons. Upon Johnson&#x27;s arrival in Dallas in 2004, the NFL relaxed rules for receivers, and now could wear numbers in the 10-19 range in addition to 80s numbers.

Since Johnson&#x27;s retirement, the NFL has since greatly expanded what numbers are available to players, with receivers now eligible to wear numbers 0–49 in addition to 80–89.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Analyst on ESPN==
Johnson was part of the 2007 NFL draft broadcasting team with Chris Berman, Mel Kiper Jr. and Chris Mortensen that aired on ESPN. In 2007, he became an ESPN analyst for &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;, and &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;. Within the confines of &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; and &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;, Johnson invented a segment called &quot;C&#x27;mon Man!&quot;, which allows each panel member to pick a moment in the last NFL week &quot;revolving around either the play on the field or unprofessional behavior off it&quot; that one might consider, on some level, either inexcusable or downright laughable. Each member verbalizes what their gripe may be, while highlights of the moment that they are illustrating run around it, and then ends with the panel member stating with disdain, &quot;C&#x27;mon man!&quot; He has also been an analyst on several ESPN telecasts, including pre-game shows on Sundays and Monday nights, and some radio work as well.

He was also an analyst on the ESPN &quot;Who&#x27;s Now&quot; competition. He occasionally hosted &quot;Jim Rome Is Burning&quot; while Jim Rome was unavailable. On January 23, 2011, Johnson was not on &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; for Championship weekend because his mother unexpectedly died. After being briefly let go by ESPN in 2016, he was brought back to appear on SportsCenter, ESPN Radio, and other shows.

On August 17, 2020, Johnson began hosting mornings on &quot;ESPN LA 710&quot; KSPN, replacing &quot;Golic and Wingo&quot;. Johnson will be joined by basketball analyst Jay Williams, a former NBA player; and Max Kellerman, with the show being titled &quot;KJM&quot;. ESPN says the hosts will discuss the morning&#x27;s top stories and overnight developments with their own perspective and analysis. Johnson will also regularly appear on &quot;Get Up&quot; and &quot;First Take.&quot;

As of June 30, 2023, Johnson is no longer working with ESPN.

==Other ventures==
Johnson co-founded First Picks Management in 2005 as a vehicle to pursue his business interests in the food service, hotel, and real estate industries as well as venture capital investing. He recruited Harvard Business School MBAs, Glenn, and Clarence Mah, as well as his public relations and marketing agent, Ingrid Roberts, to co-lead the organization. Johnson and his management team partnered with National Football League and National Basketball Association athletes, including Warrick Dunn, Dennis Northcutt, Terence Newman, and Joe Smith in developing First Picks Management, a corporate website.

In November 2008, Johnson was contracted for a weekend TV Series called &quot;Keyshawn Johnson: Tackling Design&quot;. The show was on A&amp;E in July 2009 and showcases Johnson&#x27;s knowledge of interior design to help other people redecorate their homes.

In 2012, Johnson starred in Jägermeister&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;A Stronger Bond&quot; television and digital campaign created by the award-winning advertising agency Mistress. In 2013, Johnson was announced to be a contestant on the 17th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was paired with professional dancer Sharna Burgess. On the show of September 23 he was the first celebrity voted out.

==Personal life==
He has four children: Keyshawn Jr., Maia, London, and Vance. Keyshawn Johnson Jr. was a wide receiver at the University of Nebraska. His nephew is former New Orleans Saints WR Michael Thomas.

On March 15, 2021, Johnson announced on his Twitter that his oldest daughter Maia had died at the age of 25.

<doc id="638101" wikidata="Q1334434" url="?curid=638101" title="The Rembrandts">
<text>The Rembrandts are an American alternative rock duo, formed by Danny Wilde and Phil Solem in 1989. They had previously worked together as members of Great Buildings in 1981. The Rembrandts are best known for the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot;, which was used as the main theme song for the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;.

== History ==
Wilde was a member of 1970s cult recording act The Quick, and had released several mildly successful solo albums in the 1980s. Wilde and Solem had been in the power-pop quartet Great Buildings, a band that released one album for CBS in 1981 before dissolving.

After establishing themselves as The Rembrandts in 1989, Solem and Wilde recorded a self-titled album largely in Wilde&#x27;s home studio. From this album, the group had their first success during 1990 with &quot;Just the Way It Is, Baby&quot;, which scored at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. The self-titled album scored number 88 on the Billboard 200.

The next album &quot;Untitled&quot;, of 1992, featured the minor successes &quot;Johnny, Have You Seen Her?&quot; and &quot;Chase the Clouds Away&quot;. Another track from the album, &quot;Rollin&#x27; Down the Hill&quot;, was used in the film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You,&quot; the theme for the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, reached No. 1 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart for several weeks before being released as a single and peaking at No. 17 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The single has been released in other countries, including the UK, where it reached No. 3 in 1995 and No. 5 in 1997. The success of &quot;Friends&quot; has caused a greater awareness of the band, and led to greater sales of their recorded albums. The song was also featured on the &quot;Friends Soundtrack&quot; album. An earlier, previously unreleased version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; with different lyrics was included on their &quot;Unreleased Stuff&quot; album.

In 1997, the duo split, with Solem returning to Minneapolis to concentrate on his band Thrush. In 1998, Wilde released the album &quot;Spin This&quot;, credited to &quot;Danny Wilde + The Rembrandts&quot;. In 2000, Solem and Wilde reunited, and released the album &quot;Lost Together&quot; as The Rembrandts the following year.

In 2005, the band released an album of re-recorded favorites called &quot;Choice Picks&quot;. There are two versions of &quot;Choice Picks&quot;, one released through Awarestore.com which features the new track &quot;Chasin&#x27; Down a Rainbow&quot;. The other version was released on the Fuel 2000 label, with the new track &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Me Up&quot;.

In 2006, Rhino Records released a collection called &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, a 20-song career-spanning retrospective that included material from the lone Great Buildings album, &quot;Apart from the Crowd&quot;.

In 2016, the pair reunited and announced that they would release a new album. &quot;Via Satellite&quot; was released in 2019.

== Mainstream success ==
Despite achieving success with &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There For You&quot;, the duo has been dismissive of the song. Phil Solem in 1995, said &quot;We don&#x27;t want to hang our hats on the theme from a TV show...[w]e&#x27;ve been working too long at our craft for that.&quot; The same year, the duo tried to apologize for the song on MTV News&#x27; &quot;The Year in Rock.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In 2014, Rolling Stone ranked them the 20th-best two-hit wonder of all time. Insider placed them on their list of the &quot;Best One-Hit Wonders of All Time&quot;.

== Members ==
* Danny Wilde (born June 3, 1956, Houlton, Maine, U.S.) – vocals, bass, guitar, harmonica, mandolin, keyboards, percussion
* Phil Solem (born July 1, 1956, Duluth, Minnesota, U.S.) – vocals, guitars, keyboards, banjo, bass

<text>A motor controller is a device or group of devices that can coordinate in a predetermined manner the performance of an electric motor. A motor controller might include a manual or automatic means for starting and stopping the motor, selecting forward or reverse rotation, selecting and regulating the speed, regulating or limiting the torque, and protecting against overloads and electrical faults. Motor controllers may use electromechanical switching, or may use power electronics devices to regulate the speed and direction of a motor.

== Applications ==
Motor controllers are used with both direct current and alternating current motors. A controller includes means to connect the motor to the electrical power supply, and may also include overload protection for the motor, and over-current protection for the motor and wiring. A motor controller may also supervise the motor&#x27;s field circuit, or detect conditions such as low supply voltage, incorrect polarity or incorrect phase sequence, or high motor temperature. Some motor controllers limit the inrush starting current, allowing the motor to accelerate itself and connected mechanical load more slowly than a direct connection. Motor controllers may be manual, requiring an operator to sequence a starting switch through steps to accelerate the load, or may be fully automatic, using internal timers or current sensors to accelerate the motor.

Some types of motor controllers also allow adjustment of the speed of the electric motor. For direct-current motors, the controller may adjust the voltage applied to the motor, or adjust the current flowing in the motor&#x27;s field winding. Alternating current motors may have little or no speed response to adjusting terminal voltage, so controllers for alternating current instead adjust rotor circuit resistance (for wound rotor motors) or change the frequency of the AC applied to the motor for speed control using power electronic devices or electromechanical frequency changers.

The physical design and packaging of motor controllers is about as varied as that of electric motors themselves. A wall-mounted toggle switch with suitable ratings may be all that is needed for a household ventilation fan. Power tools and household appliances may have a trigger switch that only turns the motor on and off. Industrial motors may be more complex controllers connected to automation systems; a factory may have a large number of motor controllers grouped in a motor control center. Controllers for electric travelling cranes or electric vehicles may be mounted on the mobile equipment. The largest motor controllers are used with the pumping motors of pumped storage hydroelectric plants, and may carry ratings of tens of thousands of horsepower (kilowatts).

== Types of motor controller ==
Motor controllers can be manually, remotely or automatically operated. They may include only the means for starting and stopping the motor or they may include other functions.

An electric motor controller can be classified by the type of motor it is to drive, such as permanent magnet, servo, series, separately excited, and alternating current.

A motor controller is connected to a power source, such as a battery pack or power supply, and control circuitry in the form of analog or digital input signals.

=== Motor starters ===

A small motor can be started by simply connecting it to power. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motor starter or motor contactor. When energized, a direct on line (DOL) starter immediately connects the motor terminals directly to the power supply. In smaller sizes a motor starter is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use magnetic contactors. Very large motors running on medium voltage power supplies (thousands of volts) may use power circuit breakers as switching elements.

A direct on line (DOL) or &quot;across the line&quot; starter applies the full line voltage to the motor terminals. This is the simplest type of motor starter. A DOL motor starter often contains protection devices (see below), and in some cases, condition monitoring. Smaller sizes of direct on-line starters are manually operated; larger sizes use an electromechanical contactor to switch the motor circuit. Solid-state direct on line starters also exist.

A direct on line starter can be used if the high inrush current of the motor does not cause excessive voltage drop in the supply circuit. The maximum size of a motor allowed on a direct on line starter may be limited by the supply utility for this reason. For example, a utility may require rural customers to use reduced-voltage starters for motors larger than 10 kW.

DOL starting is sometimes used to start small water pumps, compressors, fans and conveyor belts. In the case of an asynchronous motor, such as the 3-phase squirrel-cage motor, the motor will draw a high starting current until it has run up to full speed. This starting current is typically 6-7 times greater than the full load current. To reduce the inrush current, larger motors will have reduced-voltage starters or adjustable-speed drives in order to minimise voltage dips to the power supply.

A reversing starter can connect the motor for rotation in either direction. Such a starter contains two DOL circuits — one for clockwise operation and the other for counter-clockwise operation, with mechanical and electrical interlocks to prevent simultaneous closure. For three phase motors, this is achieved by swapping the wires connecting any two phases. Single phase AC motors and direct-current motors often can be reversed by swapping two wires but this is not always the case.

Motor starters other than &#x27;DOL&#x27; connect the motor through a resistance to reduce the voltage the motor coils get on start up. The resistance for this needs to be sized to the motor - and a quick source for a good resistance to use is another coil in the motor - i.e. series/parallel. In series gives a gentler start then switched to parallel for full power running. When this is done with three phase motors, it is commonly called a star-delta (US: Y-delta) starter. Old star-delta starters were manually operated and often incorporated an ammeter so the person operating the starter could see when the motor was up to speed by the fact the current it was drawing had stopped decreasing. More modern starters have built-in timers to switch from star to delta and are set by the electrical installer of the machine. The machin&#x27;s operator simply presses a green button once and the rest of the start procedure is automated.

A typical starter includes protection against overload, both electrical and mechanical, and protection against &#x27;random&#x27; starting - if, for instance, the power has been off and has just come back on. An acronym for this type of protection is TONVR - Thermal Overload, No Volt Release. It insists that the green button is pressed to start the motor. The green button switches on a solenoid which closes a contactor (i.e. switch) to primarily power the motor. It also powers the solenoid to keep the power turned on when the green button is released. In a power failure, the contactor opens turning itself and the motor off. The only way the motor can then be started is by pressing the green button. The contactor can be quickly tripped by the starter passing a very high current due to an electrical fault downstream of it in either the wiring to the motor or within the motor. The thermal overload protection consists of a heating element on each power wire which heats a bimetallic strip. The hotter the strip, the more it deflects to the point it pushes a trip bar which disconnects power to the contactor solenoid, turning everything off. Thermal overloads come in different range ratings and this should be chosen to match the motor. Within the range, they are adjustable enabling the installer to set it correctly for the given motor.

Which type for specific applications? DOL gives a quick start so is used more commonly with generally smaller motors. It is also used on machines with an uneven load such as piston type compressors where the full power of the motor is needed to get the piston past the compression stage - the actual working stage. Star-delta is generally used with larger motors or where either the motor is under no load at starting, very little load or a consistent load. It is particularly suited to motors driving machinery with heavy flywheels - to get the flywheels up to speed before the machine is engaged and driven by the flywheel.

=== Reduced voltage starters ===
Reduced-voltage or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a voltage reduction device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. Two or more contactors may be used to provide reduced voltage starting of a motor. By using an autotransformer or a series inductance, a lower voltage is present at the motor terminals, reducing starting torque and inrush current. Once the motor has come up to some fraction of its full-load speed, the starter switches to full voltage at the motor terminals. Since the autotransformer or series reactor only carries the heavy motor starting current for a few seconds, the devices can be much smaller compared to continuously rated equipment. The transition between reduced and full voltage may be based on elapsed time, or triggered when a current sensor shows the motor current has begun to reduce. An autotransformer starter was patented in 1908.

Larger 3 phase induction motors can have their power reduced within the motor ! The motor is started &#x27;DOL&#x27; with full voltage supplied to the field coils of the motor outer part (&#x27;stator&#x27;). The inner part (&#x27;rotor&#x27;) has a current induced into it to once again react with the magnetic field generated by the stator. By breaking the rotor into parts and electrically connecting these parts to external resistances via slip rings and brushes as well as control contactors, the magnetic power of the rotor can be varied - i.e. reduced, for starting or low power running. Although a much more complex process, it means the currents (electrical loads) being switched are significantly lower than if reducing the power to the main feed of the motor.

A third way to achieve a very smooth progressive start is to dip resistance rods into a conductive liquid (e.g. mercury) which has a layer of insulative oil on the top. As the rods are lowered the resistance is gradually reduced.

A star delta starter is another type of Reduced-voltage starter in induction motor. A star delta starter will start a motor with a star connected stator winding. When motor reaches about 80% of its full load speed, it will begin to run in a delta connected stator winding. Star Delta Starter are two types. (1) Manual Operated Star Delta Starter, (2) Automatic Star Delta.

The manual operated star delta starter mainly consists of a TPDP switch which stands for Triple Pole Double Throw switch. This switch changes stator winding from star to delta. During starting condition stator winding is connected in the form of a star. Now we shall see how a star delta starter reduces the starting current of a three-phase induction motor.

The above function achieved by using a power contactor and timer in automatic star delta starter. The automatic star delta starter is manufactured from three contactors, a timer and a thermal overload. The contactors are smaller than the single contactor used in a direct on line starter as they are controlling winding currents only. The currents through the winding are 1/root 3 (58%) of the current in the line. There are two contactors that are close during run, often referred to as the main contractor and the delta contactor. These are AC3 rated at 58% of the current rating of the motor. The third contactor is the star contactor and that only carries star current while the motor is connected in star. The current in star is one third of the current in delta, so this contactor can be AC3 rated at one third (33%) of the motor rating.

The transition from star to delta can be an open transition or a closed transition. During open transition, the motor starter momentarily disconnects from the motor and reconnects in a delta configuration. In closed transition, the transition from the star to delta configuration is achieved without disconnecting the motor. In order to achieve that, an additional three-pole contactor and three resistors are required.

=== Adjustable-speed drives ===

An &quot;adjustable-speed drive&quot; (ASD) or &quot;variable-speed drive&quot; (VSD) is an interconnected combination of equipment that provides a means of driving and adjusting the operating speed of a mechanical load. An electrical adjustable-speed drive consists of an electric motor and a speed controller or power converter plus auxiliary devices and equipment. In common usage, the term &quot;drive&quot; is often applied to just the controller. Most modern ASDs and VSDs can also implement soft motor starting.
=== Intelligent controllers ===
An &quot;Intelligent Motor Controller&quot; (IMC) uses a microprocessor to control power electronic devices used for motor control. IMCs monitor the load on a motor and accordingly match motor torque to motor load. This is accomplished by reducing the voltage to the AC terminals and at the same time lowering current and kvar. This can provide a measure of energy efficiency improvement for motors that run under light load for a large part of the time, resulting in less heat, noise, and vibrations
generated by the motor.

== Overload relays ==
A starter will contain protective devices for the motor. At a minimum this would include a thermal overload relay. The thermal overload is designed to open the starting circuit and thus cut the power to the motor in the event of the motor drawing too much current from the supply for an extended time. The overload relay has a normally closed contact which opens due to heat generated by excessive current flowing through the circuit. Thermal overloads have a small heating device that increases in temperature as the motor running current increases.

There are two types of thermal overload relay. In one type, a bimetallic strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.

A second type of thermal overload relay uses a eutectic alloy, like a solder, to retain a spring-loaded contact. When too much current passes through the heating element for too long a time, the alloy melts and the spring releases the contact, opening the control circuit and shutting down the motor. Since eutectic alloy elements are not adjustable, they are resistant to casual tampering but require changing the heater coil element to match the motor rated current.

Electronic digital overload relays containing a microprocessor may also be used, especially for high-value motors. These devices model the heating of the motor windings by monitoring the motor current. They can also include metering and communication functions.

== Loss of voltage protection ==
Starters using magnetic contactors usually derive the power supply for the contactor coil from the same source as the motor supply. An auxiliary contact from the contactor is used to maintain the contactor coil energized after the start command for the motor has been released. If a momentary loss of supply voltage occurs, the contactor will open and not close again until a new start command is given. This prevents restarting of the motor after a power failure. This connection also provides a small degree of protection against low power supply voltage and loss of a phase. However, since contactor coils will hold the circuit closed with as little as 80% of normal voltage applied to the coil, this is not a primary means of protecting motors from low voltage operation.

== Motor ride-through under voltage events ==
Some devices can be added so that during a voltage drop, the device maintains the current flow
that is sufficient for the hold-in coil to keep the contacts closed. The circuit is designed allows current for the hold-in coil for voltage sags down to 15-25% voltage.

== Timed Sequenced Schedule of the Automatic Restarts Of Multiple Motors ==

After the electrical power has been restored (typically after a time delay of 30 to 60 seconds), then the time sequences of the automatic restarts of multiple motors are set to automatically begin.

Without a time sequenced schedule, any attempt to restart many motors simultaneously could lead to partial or total site wide power failure.

== Servo controllers ==

Servo controllers are a wide category of motor control. Common features are:
* precise closed loop position control
* fast acceleration rates
* precise speed control Servo motors may be made from several motor types, the most common being:
** brushed DC motor
** brushless DC motors
** AC servo motors

Servo controllers use position feedback to close the control loop. This is commonly implemented with position encoders, resolvers, and Hall effect sensors to directly measure the rotor&#x27;s position.

Other position feedback methods measure the back EMF in the undriven coils to infer the rotor position, or detect the Kick-Back voltage transient (spike) that is generated whenever the power to a coil is instantaneously switched off. These are therefore often called &quot;sensorless&quot; control methods.

A servo may be controlled using pulse-width modulation (PWM). How long the pulse remains high (typically between 1 and 2 milliseconds) determines where the motor will try to position itself. Another control method is pulse and direction.

== Stepper motor controllers ==
A stepper, or stepping, motor is a synchronous, brushless, high pole count, polyphase motor. Control is usually, but not exclusively, done open loop, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the rotor position is assumed to follow a controlled rotating field. Because of this, precise positioning with steppers is simpler and cheaper than closed loop controls.

Modern stepper controllers drive the motor with much higher voltages than the motor nameplate rated voltage, and limit current through chopping. The usual setup is to have a positioning controller, known as an &quot;indexer&quot;, sending step and direction pulses to a separate higher voltage drive circuit which is responsible for commutation and current limiting.

<doc id="638106" wikidata="Q941639" url="?curid=638106" title="Tragopogon porrifolius">
<text>Tragopogon porrifolius is a plant cultivated for its ornamental flower and edible root. It also grows wild in many places and is one of the most widely known species of the salsify genus, &quot;Tragopogon&quot;. It is commonly known as purple or common salsify, oyster plant, vegetable oyster, Jerusalem star, Jack go to bed, goatsbeard, or simply salsify (although these last two names are also applied to other species).

The Latin specific epithet &quot;porrifolius&quot; means &quot;with leaves like leek&quot; (&quot;Allium porrum&quot;).

==Description==
The plant grows to around in height. As with other &quot;Tragopogon&quot; species, its stem is largely unbranched and the leaves are somewhat grasslike. It exudes a milky juice from the stems. The taproots can become long and thick.

In the UK it flowers from May to September, but in warmer areas such as California it can be found in bloom from April. The flower head is about across and each is surrounded by green bracts which are longer than the petals (technically, the ligules of the ray flowers). The flowers are like that of &quot;Tragopogon pratensis&quot;, but are larger and dull purple, across. The flowers are hermaphroditic and pollination is by insects.

The fruits are beaked achenes, rod-shaped with light ribs. They have hairs at one end that facilitate wind dispersal. The achenes are 10–17 mm long and 1–3 mm wide without counting the beak, which is up to 55 mm in length. When the fruits are formed fully, the hairs from the fruits give the appearance of a ball of fluff which gives the plant its name &quot;goatsbeard&quot;.

== Origin and distribution ==
&quot;Tragopogon porrifolius&quot; is a common biennial wildflower, native to southeast Europe, Mediterranean Turkey, and north Africa, but introduced elsewhere, for example, into the British Isles (mainly in central and southern England), other parts of northern Europe, North America and southern Africa, and in Australia. In the United States, it is now found growing wild in almost every state, including Hawaii, except in the extreme south-east.

== Cultivation ==
The root and the young shoots of &quot;T. porrifolius&quot; can be eaten (after being boiled). The freshly grown leaves can be eaten cooked or raw. Historically, the plant was cultivated for that purpose; it is mentioned by classical authors such as Pliny the Elder. Cultivation in Europe began in the 16th century in France and Italy. In the United Kingdom it was initially grown for its flower and later became a mildly popular vegetable in the 18th century but then declined in popularity. Presently the root is cultivated and eaten most frequently in France, Germany, Italy and Russia. However, in modern times it has tended to be replaced by Spanish salsify (&quot;Scorzonera hispanica&quot;) as a cultivated crop.

Cultivated varieties include &#x27;White French&#x27;, &#x27;Gian French&#x27;, &#x27;Mammoth Sandwich Island&#x27;, &#x27;Improved Mammoth Sandwich Island&#x27;, &#x27;Blauetikett&#x27;, and &#x27;Lüthy&#x27;; they are generally characterised by larger or better-shaped roots. To maintain the purity of the cultivar a distance of 500 ft (150 m) has to be met. When &quot;T. porrifolius&quot; is grown for seed, it is harvested in the second season from midsummer to early autumn to select for bolt resistance. The root becomes discoloured and spoils quickly if broken, which can easily happen since it is difficult to remove from the soil without damage.

===Sowing and soil requirements===
Salsify is grown similarly to other root vegetables like parsnip and carrots and thus requires similar attention. Sowing can be done in late summer or early winter to foster an early growth. Planting can also be done in early spring about 100 days before the first frosts in a well prepared soil, preferably a loam or silt-loam. It should be done at the depth of 1.3 to 2 cm. Spacing between rows should be around 45 to 60 cm and the seeds should be separated by 3 cm approximately. This represent 12 g of seeds per 10 m of row for the cultivar &#x27;Mammoth Sandwich Island&#x27;. A thinning to 5 cm between the plants is needed when the seedlings reach 5 cm. &quot;T. porrifolius&quot; needs deep and loose soils which are not too dry for a good development of the taproot. Stony or waterlogged soils have negative effects on yields and hamper harvesting. Other root crops, legumes and cereals have been mentioned as possible preculture. &quot;T. porrifolius&quot; is a moderate feeder, therefore the application of fresh manure does not benefit yields. During the main growing period a good water supply prevents potential branching of the taproot.

===Climate requirements===
There are no specific requirements known for the cultivation of &quot;T. porrifolius&quot;, but they have been successfully cultivated in temperate climate zones. The seedlings need a temperature of 8–16 °C to germinate and the plant will freeze between −1.1 and −1.6 °C. &quot;T. porrifolius&quot; can cope with low temperatures and is not injured by light freezing.

===Growth and development===
The seeds need 8–10 days of germination time. &quot;T. porrifolius&quot; is a biennial plant. In the first year only the vegetative parts of the plant are developed. In autumn, the energy is stored in the root system, which is depending on the variety more or less branched. In the second season the generative purple flowers evolve. They bloom from early to mid summer.

===Harvest and storage===
The taproots are usually harvested from late autumn onwards (later than October in the Northern Hemisphere) and during winter. Harvesting after a frost is favoured to improve the taste of the root. After flowering, the taproot becomes stringy and inedible. The taproots can be stored in traditional clamps although refrigerated storage has been recommended at 0 °C and 90–95% relative humidity for 2–4 months.

===Pests and diseases===
Few pests or diseases affect &quot;T. porrifolius&quot;. White rust (&quot;Albugo tragopogonis&quot;) is the most common disease of &quot;T. porrifolius&quot;. Closely related wild species (e.g. &quot;Tragopogon pratensis&quot;), black salsify (&quot;Scorzonera hispanica&quot;), gerbera (&quot;Gerbera&quot;) and sunflower (&quot;Helianthus annuus&quot;) are also found to be hosts of this fungus. At an early stage chlorotic spotting is visible on leaves and stems. These develop during the course of disease into small white blisters.

Occasional problems are reported with rust diseases caused by &quot;Puccinia hystericum&quot;, &quot;Puccinia jackyana&quot; and &quot;Puccinia scorzonera&quot;. Mulching with oats and the use of spring vetch (&quot;Vicia sativa&quot;) or blue tansy (&quot;Phacelia tanacetifolia&quot;) as cover crops reduces the number of fungi infecting seedlings and roots. The following fungi have been isolated from &quot;T. porrifolius&quot; seedlings and roots: &quot;Alternaria alternata&quot;, &quot;Fusarium culmorum&quot;, &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;, &quot;Penicillium&quot; spp., &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot; and &quot;Sclerotinia sclerotiorum&quot;.

When the rows are planted too close together, powdery mildew (&quot;Erysiphe cichoriacearum&quot;) can affect the plants.

When the roots are left in the ground over winter, mice and voles may nibble them.

== Uses ==
A latex derived from the root can be used as a chewing gum.

===As food===
The plant is edible, but the roots and leaves are most palatable when collected before the flower stalk is produced. The root is noted for having a mild taste when uncooked, described as like asparagus or oysters, from which the plant derives its alternative name of oyster plant. The outer layers can be scraped off, with the root dipped in cold water to preserve its colour. If too tough for eating, they can be boiled with a pinch of baking soda and a change of water. Raw young roots can be grated for use in salads, but older roots are better cooked. They can be added to soups, stews or stir-fries. Salsify purée (alone or including potato) is recommended with fish.

The flowering shoots can be used like asparagus, either raw or cooked and the flowers can be added to salad, while the sprouted seeds can be used in salads or sandwiches.

Raw salsify is 77% water, 19% carbohydrates, 3% protein and contains negligible fat. In a 100 gram reference amount, raw salsify supplies 82 calories and moderate contents of riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin C, manganese and phosphorus.

==Phytochemicals==
&quot;Tragopogon porrifolius&quot; contains polyphenol phytochemicals which are under preliminary research for their potential biological effects. &quot;Tragopogon&quot; species are being studied at the biochemical level for their novel enzyme forms and genetic polymorphism.

<text>Eduard Veniaminovich Limonov (né Savenko; , ; 22 February 1943 – 17 March 2020) was a Russian writer, poet, publicist, political dissident and politician.

He emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1974, but returned to Russia in 1991, where he founded the National Bolshevik Party. The party was banned in the country in 2007 and superseded by The Other Russia. In the 2000s, he was one of the leaders of The Other Russia coalition of opposition forces.

==Biography==
===Early life, 1943–1966===
Limonov was born in the Soviet Union, in Dzerzhinsk, an industrial town in Gorky Oblast (now Nizhny Novgorod Oblast). His father was born in the Voronezh Oblast while his mother was born in the Gorky Oblast. Limonov&#x27;s fatherthen in the military servicewas in a state security career and his mother was a homemaker. In the early years of his life his family moved to Kharkov in the Ukrainian SSR, where Limonov grew up. He studied at the H.S. Skovoroda Kharkiv National Pedagogical University.

By Limonov&#x27;s own account, he began writing &quot;very bad&quot; poetry at the age of thirteen and soon after became involved in theft and petty crime as an adolescent hooligan. Limonov adopted his pen name for use in literary circles during this time.

===&quot;Konkret&quot; poets in Moscow, 1966–1974===
In 1966, together with his first actual wife, Anna Moiseevna Rubinstein, (their marriage was not registered officially) he first came to Moscow, earning money sewing trousers (Limonov &quot;dressed&quot; many in the intelligentsia; sculptor Ernst Neizvestny and poet Bulat Okudzhava among others), but later returned to Kharkov.

Limonov moved to Moscow again in 1967, marrying a fellow poet, Yelena Shchapova, in a Russian Orthodox ceremony in 1973. During his period in Moscow, Limonov was involved in the &quot;Konkret&quot; poets&#x27; group and sold volumes of his self-published poetry while doing various day jobs. Having achieved a degree of success in this manner by the mid-1970s, and he and his wife emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1974. The exact circumstances of Limonov&#x27;s departure are unclear and have been described differently. Reportedly, KGB secret police gave him a choice either to become a informant, or leave the country.

===Literary exile in New York, 1974–1980===
Although neither he nor Shchapova were Jewish, the Soviet Union issued permission for the couple to emigrate to Israel, but soon after the couple arrived in the United States. Limonov settled in New York City, where he and Shchapova soon divorced.

Limonov worked for a Russian-language newspaper as a proofreader and occasionally interviewed recent Soviet emigrants. Like Eddie, the immigrant protagonist of Limonov&#x27;s first novel &quot;It&#x27;s Me, Eddie&quot;, Limonov was drawn to punk subculture and radical politics. Limonov&#x27;s New York acquaintances included Studio 54&#x27;s Steve Rubell and a Trotskyist group, the Socialist Workers Party. As protagonist Eddie finds out as a consequence, the latter is a political target of the FBI. Limonov was himself harassed by the FBI. As he later recounted, the FBI interrogated dozens of his acquaintances, once asking a friend about &quot;Lermontov&quot; in Paris when he had resettled in France. 

The first chapter of &quot;It&#x27;s Me, Eddie&quot;, was published by an Israeli Russian-language journal. Finished by 1977, it was consistently rejected by publishers in the United States and only brought out a few years after becoming an instant success in France in 1980. In interviews, Limonov says this was because the book was not written with an anti-Soviet tone as was other Russian literature admired in the United States.

In New York, Limonov also discovered another side of the American Dream. After being a dissident, he lived a poor life due to his low income. He managed to afford a room in a miserable hostel and spent time with homeless persons, some of whom he had casual sexual intercourse with, as related in ‘’It’s me, Eddie’’, published in France under the title &quot;Le poète russe préfère les grands nègres&quot;. He then found a job as a butler for a millionaire in the Upper East Side. This period of his life led him to write autobiographical texts, including &quot;His Butler&#x27;s Story&quot;.

===Limonov&#x27;s stay in Paris, 1980–1991===
Finally, disillusioned with the country he termed &quot;a damned outhouse bereft of spirit or purpose on the outskirts of civilization&quot;, Limonov left America for Paris with his lover Natalya Medvedeva in 1980, where he became active in French literary circles. He swore to never return to the United States, and never did. Having remained stateless for thirteen years, he was granted French citizenship in 1987. Limonov and Medvedeva got married in 1982; the pair split up by 1995.

===Return to Russia and the foundation of NBP, 1991–2000 ===
In 1991, Limonov returned to Russia from France, restored his citizenship, and became active in politics. 

Limonov was an active supporter of Serbia in the wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia. Paweł Pawlikowski&#x27;s film &quot;Serbian Epics&quot; includes footage of him meeting with Radovan Karadžić, then the Bosnian Serb president and later a convicted war criminal, on the front lines of Sarajevo in 1992. The film also shows Limonov participating in a sniper patrol and firing a few rounds with a machine gun on the outskirts of the besieged city. When asked about the incident in 2010, Limonov said he had been shooting at a target range and that Pawlikowski added an extra camera angle to make it appear he had fired into a populated area. This explanation has been challenged.

On another occasion, Limonov said that he &quot;celebrated his 50th birthday in Kninska Krajina ... by firing from a Russian-made heavy gun at Croatian Army headquarters.&quot; During the 1990s, he supported Bosnian Serbs in the Yugoslav wars; and Abkhaz and Transnistrian secessionists against Georgia and Moldova, respectively. Limonov was also initially an ally of Vladimir Zhirinovsky and was named as Security Minister in a shadow cabinet formed by Zhirinovsky in 1992. However Limonov soon tired of Zhirinovsky, accusing him of moderateness and of approaching the president and consequently split from him, publishing the book &quot;Limonov against Zhirinovsky&quot; (1994).

In 1993, together with figures like Aleksandr Dugin and Yegor Letov, he founded the National Bolshevik Party which started to publish a newspaper called &quot;Limonka&quot; (the Russian nickname for the lemon-shaped F1 hand grenade; also a play on his pen name Limonov). In 1996, a Russian court judged in a hearing that the NBP paper &quot;Limonka&quot; had disseminated illegal and immoral information: &quot;in essence, E. V. Limonov (Savenko) is an advocate of revenge and mass terror, raised to the level of state policy.&quot; The court decided to recommend issuing an official warning to Limonka, to investigate the possibility of examining whether Limonov could be held legally responsible, and to publish its decision in &quot;Rossiiskaia gazeta&quot;. After that, a criminal case was launched against him on charges of incitement of ethnic hatred. On the Ukrainian Independence Day 24 August 1999, Limonov along with 15 other supporters from the top of the city&#x27;s clock tower in Sevastopol publicly called to review the status of the city and not to ratify the Treaty about Friendship and Cooperation between Russia and Ukraine by the State Duma.

=== Jail and protest activities, 2001–2013 ===
Limonov was jailed in April 2001 on charges of terrorism, the forced overthrow of the constitutional order, and the illegal purchase of weapons. Based on an article published in &quot;Limonka&quot; under Limonov&#x27;s byline, the government accused Limonov of planning to raise an army to invade Kazakhstan. After one year in jail, his trial was heard in a Saratov court, which also heard appeals from Russian Duma members Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Alexei Mitrofanov and Vasiliy Shandybin for his release. He maintained that the charges were ridiculous and politically motivated, but was convicted and sentenced to four years imprisonment for the arms purchasing, while the other charges were dropped. He served almost two years before being paroled for good behavior. He wrote eight books while in jail.

In 2006, Limonov married the actress Yekaterina Volkova. They had a son, Bogdan, and a daughter, Alexandra. They split up in 2008.

On 19 April 2007, the Moscow City Court banned the National Bolshevik Party as extremist. The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court.
Limonov continued his political activities as one of the leaders of &quot;The Other Russia&quot;, along with liberal, nationalist and communist politicians. He took part in various protests and was one of the organizers of the &quot;Dissenters&#x27; Marches&quot;. In particular, on 3 March 2007, Limonov was detained by police in the very beginning of the rally the first Saint Petersburg Dissenters&#x27; March; on 14 April 2007, Limonov was arrested again after an anti-government rally in Moscow; on 31 January 2009 was detained again in Moscow.

In July 2009, he helped organise the &quot;Strategy-31&quot; series of protests.

Soon, Limonov split up with the liberal opposition. In July 2010, he and his followers established &quot;The Other Russia&quot; political party, as the informal successor to the NBP. It was denied official registration in 2010 and in 2019, after it got re-established without Limonov as formally part of its leadership.

=== Later life and death, 2013–2020 ===
Since 2014, Limonov supported the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the unrecognized Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and Lugansk People&#x27;s Republic, and encouraged Russians to take part in the Russo-Ukrainian War on a Russian side. The Other Russia also created a militia called &quot;Interbrigades&quot; to support the separatist movement in Donbas; they took part in the battles for Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, and also were engaged in the protection of the leader of Limonov during his visit to the Luhansk region.

He died on 17 March 2020 in Moscow. It was reported that Limonov had been battling cancer; complications from two surgery procedures such as 
throat problems, struggles with oncology, and inflammation were cited as the direct cause of his death.

== Literary work ==
Limonov&#x27;s works are known for their cynicism. His novels are also (to an extent, fictive) memoirs, describing his experiences as a youth in Russia and as émigré in the United States. In 2007, the Swiss novelist Christian Kracht wrote to American businessman David Woodard, &quot;Solzhenitsyn has described Limonov as &#x27;a little insect who writes pornography,&#x27; while Limonov described Solzhenitsyn as a traitor to his homeland who contributed to the downfall of the USSR. Ad Marginem publishes my friend Eduard Limonov&#x27;s novels. Your obedient servant—Christian Eduard Kracht (truthfully my middle name)&quot;

Limonov&#x27;s works were scandalous for the Russian public, once they began to be published in the USSR during the late perestroika era. Particularly noted is &quot;It&#x27;s Me, Eddie&quot;, which contained numerous pornographic descriptions of homosexual acts involving the narrator. The author later argued that such scenes were purely fiction; however, his fellow Russian nationalists were nevertheless appalled by such descriptions in Limonov&#x27;s work. Thus, the Neo-Nazi leader Alexander Barkashov remarked to a journalist of &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; concerning Limonov: &quot;Если лидер педераст, то он родину продаст.&quot; (&quot;If the leader is a pederast, he will betray the fatherland.&quot;)

Russian film director and screenwriter Alexander Veledinsky&#x27;s 2004 feature film &quot;It&#x27;s Russian&quot; is based on Limonov&#x27;s writings. In late 1990s and early 2000s, Limonov was a regular contributor to &quot;Living Here&quot; and later to &quot;the eXile&quot;, both English-language newspapers in Moscow. These were the only known sources where Limonov wrote articles in English. When he joined as a contributor, he specifically asked the editors of the paper that they preserve his &quot;terrible Russian-English style.&quot; Although most of his featured articles were political, he also wrote on many topics, including &quot;advice for ambitious youngsters.&quot;

=== Influences ===
Limonov expressed that his favorite poet was Velimir Khlebnikov. Japanese writer Yukio Mishima is noted, by some observers, as an influence on Limonov&#x27;s writing.

== Works about Limonov ==
Eduard Limonov&#x27;s life is related in detail by Emmanuel Carrère in his 2011 biographical novel &quot;Limonov&quot; and in the Adam Curtis documentary series &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;. English actor Ben Whishaw portrayed Limonov in &quot;&quot;, a film by Kirill Serebrennikov based on Carrère&#x27;s novel.

<text>JTAG (named after the Joint Test Action Group which codified it) is an industry standard for verifying designs of and testing printed circuit boards after manufacture.

JTAG implements standards for on-chip instrumentation in electronic design automation (EDA) as a complementary tool to digital simulation. It specifies the use of a dedicated debug port implementing a serial communications interface for low-overhead access without requiring direct external access to the system address and data buses. The interface connects to an on-chip Test Access Port (TAP) that implements a stateful protocol to access a set of test registers that present chip logic levels and device capabilities of various parts.

The Joint Test Action Group formed in 1985 to develop a method of verifying designs and testing printed circuit boards after manufacture. In 1990 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers codified the results of the effort in IEEE Standard 1149.1-1990, entitled &quot;Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture&quot;.

The JTAG standards have been extended by multiple semiconductor chip manufacturers with specialized variants to provide vendor-specific features.

== History ==
In the 1980s, multi-layer circuit boards and integrated circuits (ICs) using ball grid array and similar mounting technologies were becoming standard, and connections were being made between ICs that were not available to probes. The majority of manufacturing and field faults in circuit boards were due to poor solder joints on the boards, imperfections among board connections, or the bonds and bond wires from IC pads to pin lead frames. The Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) was formed in 1985 to provide a pins-out view from one IC pad to another so these faults could be discovered.

The industry standard became an IEEE standard in 1990 as IEEE Std. 1149.1-1990 after years of initial use. In the same year, Intel released their first processor with JTAG (the 80486) which led to quicker industry adoption by all manufacturers. In 1994, a supplement that contains a description of the boundary scan description language (BSDL) was added. Further refinements regarding the use of all-zeros for EXTEST, separating the use of SAMPLE from PRELOAD and better implementation for OBSERVE_ONLY cells were made and released in 2001. Since 1990, this standard has been adopted by electronics companies around the world. Boundary scan is now mostly synonymous with JTAG, but JTAG has essential uses beyond such manufacturing applications.
The 2013 revision of IEEE Std. 1149.1 has introduced a vast set of optional features, associated extensions to BSDL, and a new procedural description language (PDL) based on Tcl.

=== Debugging ===
Although JTAG&#x27;s early applications targeted board-level testing, here the JTAG standard was designed to assist with device, board, and system testing, diagnosis, and fault isolation. Today JTAG is used as the primary means of accessing sub-blocks of integrated circuits, making it an essential mechanism for debugging embedded systems which might not have any other debug-capable communications channel. On most systems, JTAG-based debugging is available from the very first instruction after CPU reset, letting it assist with development of early boot software which runs before anything is set up. An in-circuit emulator (or, more correctly, a &quot;JTAG adapter&quot;) uses JTAG as the transport mechanism to access on-chip debug modules inside the target CPU. Those modules let software developers debug the software of an embedded system directly at the machine instruction level when needed, or (more typically) in terms of high-level language source code.

System software debug support is for many software developers the main reason to be interested in JTAG. Multiple silicon architectures such as PowerPC, MIPS, ARM, and x86 built an entire software debug, instruction tracing, and data tracing infrastructure around the basic JTAG protocol. Frequently individual silicon vendors however only implement parts of these extensions. Some examples are ARM CoreSight and Nexus as well as Intel&#x27;s BTS (Branch Trace Storage), LBR (Last Branch Record), and IPT (Intel Processor Trace) implementations. There are a number of other such silicon vendor-specific extensions that may not be documented except under NDA. The adoption of the JTAG standard helped move JTAG-centric debugging environments away from early processor-specific designs. Processors can normally be halted, single stepped, or let run freely. One can set code breakpoints, both for code in RAM (often using a special machine instruction e.g. INT3) and in ROM/flash. Data breakpoints are often available, as is bulk data download to RAM. Most designs have &quot;halt mode debugging&quot;, but some allow debuggers to access registers and data buses without needing to halt the core being debugged. Some toolchains can use ARM Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) modules, or equivalent implementations in other architectures to trigger debugger (or tracing) activity on complex hardware events, like a logic analyzer programmed to ignore the first seven accesses to a register from one particular subroutine.

Sometimes FPGA developers also use JTAG to develop debugging tools. The same JTAG techniques used to debug software running inside a CPU can help debug other digital design blocks inside an FPGA. For example, custom JTAG instructions can be provided to allow reading registers built from arbitrary sets of signals inside the FPGA, providing visibility for behaviors that are invisible to boundary scan operations. Similarly, writing such registers could provide controllability that is not otherwise available.

=== Storing firmware ===
JTAG allows device programmer hardware to transfer data into internal non-volatile device memory (e.g., CPLDs). Some device programmers serve a double purpose for programming as well as debugging the device. In the case of FPGAs, volatile memory devices can also be programmed via the JTAG port, normally during development work. In addition, internal monitoring capabilities (temperature, voltage, and current) may be accessible via the JTAG port.

JTAG programmers are also used to write software and data into flash memory. This is usually done using the same data bus access the CPU would use, and is sometimes handled by the CPU. In other cases the memory chips themselves have JTAG interfaces. Some modern debug architectures provide internal and external bus master access without needing to halt and take over a CPU. In the worst case, it is usually possible to drive external bus signals using the boundary scan facility.

As a practical matter, when developing an embedded system, emulating the instruction store is the fastest way to implement the &quot;debug cycle&quot; (edit, compile, download, test, and debug). This is because the in-circuit emulator simulating an instruction store can be updated very quickly from the development host via, say, USB. Using a serial UART port and bootloader to upload firmware to Flash makes this debug cycle quite slow and possibly expensive in terms of tools; installing firmware into Flash (or SRAM instead of Flash) via JTAG is an intermediate solution between these extremes.

=== Boundary scan testing ===
JTAG boundary scan technology provides access to a number of logic signals of a complex integrated circuit, including the device pins. The signals are represented in the boundary scan register (BSR) accessible via the TAP. This permits testing as well as controlling the states of the signals for testing and debugging. Therefore, both software and hardware (manufacturing) faults may be located and an operating device may be monitored.

When combined with built-in self-test (BIST), the JTAG scan chain enables a low overhead, embedded solution to test an IC for certain static faults (shorts, opens, and logic errors). The scan chain mechanism does not generally help diagnose or test for timing, temperature or other dynamic operational errors that may occur. Test cases are often provided in standardized formats such as SVF, or its binary sibling XSVF, and used in production tests. The ability to perform such testing on finished boards is an essential part of Design For Test in today&#x27;s products, increasing the number of faults that can be found before products ship to customers.

== Electrical characteristics ==

A JTAG interface is a special interface added to a chip. Depending on the version of JTAG, two, four, or five pins are added. The four and five pin interfaces are designed so that multiple chips on a board can have their JTAG lines daisy-chained together if specific conditions are met. The two-pin interface is designed so that multiple chips can be connected in a star topology. In either case, a test probe need only connect to a single JTAG port to have access to all chips on a circuit board.

=== Daisy-chained JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) ===
The connector pins are:

#TDI (Test Data In)
#TDO (Test Data Out)
#TCK (Test Clock)
#TMS (Test Mode Select)
#TRST (Test Reset) optional.

The TRST pin is an optional active-low reset to the test logic, usually asynchronous, but sometimes synchronous, depending on the chip. If the pin is not available, the test logic can be reset by switching to the reset state synchronously, using TCK and TMS. Note that resetting test logic doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply resetting anything else. There are generally some processor-specific JTAG operations which can reset all or part of the chip being debugged.

Since only one data line is available, the protocol is serial. The clock input is at the TCK pin. One bit of data is transferred in from TDI, and out to TDO per TCK rising clock edge. Different instructions can be loaded. Instructions for typical ICs might read the chip ID, sample input pins, drive (or float) output pins, manipulate chip functions, or bypass (pipe TDI to TDO to logically shorten chains of multiple chips).

As with any clocked signal, data presented to TDI must be valid for some chip-specific &quot;Setup&quot; time before and &quot;Hold&quot; time after the relevant (here, rising) clock edge. TDO data is valid for some chip-specific time after the falling edge of TCK.

The maximum operating frequency of TCK varies depending on all chips in the chain (the lowest speed must be used), but it is typically 10-100 MHz (100-10 ns per bit). Also TCK frequencies depend on board layout and JTAG adapter capabilities and state. One chip might have a 40 MHz JTAG clock, but only if it is using a 200 MHz clock for non-JTAG operations; and it might need to use a much slower clock when it is in a low-power mode. Accordingly, some JTAG adapters have &quot;adaptive clocking&quot; using an RTCK (Return TCK) signal. Faster TCK frequencies are most useful when JTAG is used to transfer much data, such as when storing a program executable into flash memory.

Clocking changes on TMS steps through a standardized JTAG state machine. The JTAG state machine can reset, access an instruction register, or access data selected by the instruction register.

JTAG platforms often add signals to the handful defined by the IEEE 1149.1 specification. A System Reset (SRST) signal is quite common, letting debuggers reset the whole system, not just the parts with JTAG support. Sometimes there are event signals used to trigger activity by the host or by the device being monitored through JTAG; or, perhaps, additional control lines.

Even though few consumer products provide an explicit JTAG port connector, the connections are often available on the printed circuit board as a remnant from development prototyping and/or production. When exploited, these connections often provide the most viable means for reverse engineering.

=== Reduced pin count JTAG (IEEE 1149.7) ===
Reduced pin count JTAG uses only two wires, a clock wire and a data wire. This is defined as part of the IEEE 1149.7 standard. The connector pins are:

#TMSC (Test Serial Data)
#TCK (Test Clock)

It is called cJTAG for compact JTAG.

The two-wire interface reduced pressure on the number of pins, and devices can be connected in a star topology. The star topology enables some parts of the system to be powered down, while others can still be accessed over JTAG; a daisy chain requires all JTAG interfaces to be powered. Other two-wire interfaces exist, such as Serial Wire Debug (SWD) and Spy-Bi-Wire (SBW).

== Communications model ==

In JTAG, devices expose one or more &quot;test access ports&quot; (TAPs). The picture above shows three TAPs, which might be individual chips or might be modules inside one chip. A daisy chain of TAPs is called a &quot;scan chain&quot;, or (loosely) a target. Scan chains can be arbitrarily long, but in practice, twenty TAPs is unusually long.

To use JTAG, a host is connected to the target&#x27;s JTAG signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO, etc.) through some kind of &quot;JTAG adapter&quot;, which may need to handle issues like level shifting and galvanic isolation. The adapter connects to the host using some interface such as USB, PCI, Ethernet, and so forth.

=== Primitives ===

The host communicates with the TAPs by manipulating TMS and TDI in conjunction with TCK and reading results through TDO (which is the only standard host-side input). TMS/TDI/TCK output transitions create the basic JTAG communication primitive on which higher layer protocols build:

* &quot;State switching&quot; ... All TAPs are in the same state, and that state changes on TCK transitions. This JTAG state machine is part of the JTAG spec and includes sixteen states. There are six stable states where keeping TMS stable prevents the state from changing. In all other states, TCK always changes that state. In addition, asserting TRST forces entry to one of those stable states (Test_Logic_Reset), in a slightly quicker way than the alternative of holding TMS high and cycling TCK five times.
* &quot;Shifting&quot; ... Most parts of the JTAG state machine support two stable states used to transfer data. Each TAP has an &quot;instruction register&quot; (IR) and a &quot;data register&quot; (DR). The size of those registers varies between TAPs, and those registers are combined through TDI and TDO to form a large shift register. (The size of the DR is a function of the value in that TAP&#x27;s current IR, and possibly of the value specified by a SCAN_N instruction.) There are three operations defined on that shift register:
** &quot;Capturing&quot; a temporary value
*** Entry to the &quot;Shift_IR&quot; stable state goes via the Capture_IR state, loading the shift register with a partially fixed value (not the current instruction)
*** Entry to the &quot;Shift_DR&quot; stable state goes via the Capture_DR state, loading the value of the Data Register specified by the TAP&#x27;s current IR.
** &quot;Shifting&quot; that value bit-by-bit, in either the Shift_IR or Shift_DR stable state; TCK transitions shift the shift register one bit, from TDI towards TDO, exactly like a SPI mode 1 data transfer through a daisy chain of devices (with TMS=0 acting like the chip select signal, TDI as MOSI, etc.).
** &quot;Updating&quot; IR or DR from the temporary value shifted in, on transition through the Update_IR or Update_DR state. Note that it is not possible to read (capture) a register without writing (updating) it, and vice versa. A common idiom adds flag bits to say whether the update should have side effects, or whether the hardware is ready to execute such side effects.
* &quot;Running&quot; ... One stable state is called Run_Test/Idle. The distinction is TAP-specific. Clocking TCK in the Idle state has no particular side effects, but clocking it in the Run_Test state may change system state. For example, some ARM9 cores support a debugging mode where TCK cycles in the Run_Test state drive the instruction pipeline.

At a basic level, using JTAG involves reading and writing instructions and their associated data registers; and sometimes involves running a number of test cycles. Behind those registers is hardware that is not specified by JTAG, and which has its own states that is affected by JTAG activities.

Most JTAG hosts use the shortest path between two states, perhaps constrained by quirks of the adapter. (For example, one adapter only handles paths whose lengths are multiples of seven bits.) Some layers built on top of JTAG monitor the state transitions and use uncommon paths to trigger higher-level operations. Some ARM cores use such sequences to enter and exit a two-wire (non-JTAG) SWD mode. A Zero Bit Scan (ZBS) sequence is used in IEEE 1149.7 to access advanced functionality such as switching TAPs into and out of scan chains, power management, and a different two-wire mode.

=== JTAG IEEE Std 1149.1 (boundary scan) instructions ===

Instruction register sizes tend to be small, perhaps four or seven bits wide. Except for BYPASS and EXTEST, all instruction opcodes are defined by the TAP implementer, as are their associated data registers; undefined instruction codes should not be used. Two key instructions are:

* The BYPASS instruction, an opcode of all ones regardless of the TAP&#x27;s instruction register size, must be supported by all TAPs. The instruction selects a single-bit data register (also called BYPASS). The instruction allows this device to be bypassed (do nothing) while other devices in the scan path are exercised.
* The optional IDCODE instruction, with an implementer-defined opcode. IDCODE is associated with a 32-bit register (IDCODE). Its data uses a standardized format that includes a manufacturer code (derived from the JEDEC &quot;Standard Manufacturer&#x27;s Identification Code&quot; standard, JEP-106), a part number assigned by the manufacturer, and a part version code. IDCODE is widely, but not universally, supported.

On exit from the RESET state, the instruction register is preloaded with either BYPASS or IDCODE. This allows JTAG hosts to identify the size and, at least partially, contents of the scan chain to which they are connected. (They can enter the RESET state then scan the Data Register until they read back the data they wrote. A BYPASS register has only a zero bit; while an IDCODE register is 32 bits and starts with a one. So the bits not written by the host can easily be mapped to TAPs.) Such identification is often used to sanity-check manual configuration since IDCODE is often unspecific. It could for example identify an ARM Cortex-M3-based microcontroller, without specifying the microcontroller vendor or model; or a particular FPGA, but not how it has been programmed.

A common idiom involves shifting BYPASS into the instruction registers of all TAPs except one, which receives some other instruction. That way all TAPs except one expose a single-bit data register, and values can be selectively shifted into or out of that one TAP&#x27;s data register without affecting any other TAP.

The IEEE 1149.1 (JTAG) standard describes a number of instructions to support boundary scan applications. Some of these instructions are &quot;mandatory&quot;, but TAPs used for debug instead of boundary scan testing sometimes provide minimal or no support for these instructions. Those &quot;mandatory&quot; instructions operate on the Boundary Scan Register (BSR) defined in the BSDL file, and include:

* EXTEST for external testing, such as using pins to probe board-level behaviors
* PRELOAD loading pin output values before EXTEST (sometimes combined with SAMPLE)
* SAMPLE reading pin values into the boundary scan register

IEEE-defined &quot;optional&quot; instructions include:
* CLAMP a variant of BYPASS that drives the output pins using the PRELOADed values
* HIGHZ deactivates the outputs of all pins
* INTEST for internal testing, such as using pins to probe on-chip behaviors
* RUNBIST places the chip in a self-test mode
* USERCODE returns a user-defined code, for example, to identify which FPGA image is active

Devices may define more instructions, and those definitions should be part of a BSDL file provided by the manufacturer. They are often only marked as PRIVATE.

=== Boundary scan register ===

Devices communicate to the world via a set of input and output pins. By themselves, these pins provide limited visibility into the workings of the device. However, devices that support boundary scan contain a shift-register cell for each signal pin of the device. These registers are connected in a dedicated path around the device&#x27;s boundary (hence the name). The path creates a virtual access capability that circumvents the normal inputs and outputs, providing direct control of the device and detailed visibility for signals.

The contents of the boundary scan register, including signal I/O capabilities, are usually described by the manufacturer using a part-specific BSDL file. These are used with design &#x27;netlists&#x27; from CAD/EDA systems to develop tests used in board manufacturing. Commercial test systems often cost several thousand dollars for a complete system and include diagnostic options to pinpoint faults such as open circuits and shorts. They may also offer schematic or layout viewers to depict the fault in a graphical manner.

To enable boundary scanning, IC vendors add logic to each of their devices, including scan cells for each of the signal pins. These cells are then connected together to form the boundary scan shift register (BSR), which is connected to a TAP controller. These designs are parts of most Verilog or VHDL libraries. Overhead for this additional logic is minimal, and generally is well worth the price to enable efficient testing at the board level.

== Example: ARM11 debug TAP ==

An example helps show the operation of JTAG in real systems. The example here is the debug TAP of an ARM11 processor, the ARM1136 core. The processor itself has extensive JTAG capability, similar to what is found in other CPU cores, and it is integrated into chips with even more extensive capabilities accessed through JTAG.

This is a non-trivial example, which is representative of a significant cross section of JTAG-enabled systems. In addition, it shows how control mechanisms are built using JTAG&#x27;s register read/write primitives, and how those combine to facilitate testing and debugging complex logic elements; CPUs are common, but FPGAs and ASICs include other complex elements which need to be debugged.

Licensees of this core integrate it into chips, usually combining it with other TAPs as well as numerous peripherals and memory. One of those other TAPs handles boundary scan testing for the whole chip; it is not supported by the debug TAP. Examples of such chips include:

* The OMAP2420, which includes a boundary scan TAP, the ARM1136 Debug TAP, an ETB11 trace buffer TAP, a C55x DSP, and a TAP for an ARM7 TDMI-based imaging engine, with the boundary scan TAP (&quot;ICEpick-B&quot;) having the ability to splice TAPs into and out of the JTAG scan chain.
* The i.MX31 processor, which is similar, although its &quot;System JTAG&quot; boundary scan TAP, which is very different from ICEpick, and it includes a TAP for its DMA engine instead of a DSP and imaging engine.

Those processors are both intended for use in wireless handsets such as cell phones, which is part of the reason they include TAP controllers which modify the JTAG scan chain: Debugging low power operation requires accessing chips when they are largely powered off, and thus when not all TAPs are operational. That scan chain modification is one subject of a forthcoming IEEE 1149.7 standard.

=== JTAG facilities ===
This debug TAP exposes several standard instructions, and a few specifically designed for hardware-assisted debugging, where a software tool (the debugger) uses JTAG to communicate with a system being debugged:

* codice_1 and codice_2, standard instructions as described above
* codice_3, codice_4, standard instructions, but operating on the core instead of an external boundary scan chain. codice_3 is nominally for writing data to the core, codice_4 is nominally for reading it; but two scan chains are exceptions to that rule.
* codice_7 ARM instruction to select the numbered scan chain used with codice_3 or codice_4. There are six scan chains:
** codice_10 - Device ID Register, 40 bits of read-only identification data
** codice_11 - Debug Status and Control Register (DSCR), 32 bits used to operate the debug facilities
** codice_12 - Instruction Transfer Register (ITR), 33 bits (32 instruction plus one status bit) used to execute processor instructions while in a special &quot;debug mode&quot; (see below)
** codice_13 - Debug Communications Channel (DCC), 34 bits (one long data word plus two status bits) used for bidirectional data transfer to the core. This is used both in debug mode and possibly at runtime when talking to debugger-aware software.
** codice_14 - Embedded Trace Module (ETM), 40 bits (7-bit address, one 32-bit long data word, and a R/W bit) used to control the operation of a passive instruction and data trace mechanism. This feeds either an on-chip Embedded Trace Buffer (ETB) or an external high-speed trace data collection pod. Tracing supports passive debugging (examining execution history) and profiling for performance tuning.
** codice_15 - debug module, 40 bits (7-bit address, one 32-bit long data word, and a R/W bit) used to access hardware breakpoints, watchpoints, and more. These can be written while the processor is running; it does not need to be in Debug Mode.
* codice_16 and codice_17, ARM11-specific instructions to halt and restart the CPU. Halting it puts the core into the &quot;debug mode&quot;, where the ITR can be used to execute instructions, including using the DCC to transfer data between the debug (JTAG) host and the CPU.
* codice_18, ARM11-specific instruction to accelerate some operations with ITR.
That model resembles the model used in other ARM cores. Non-ARM systems generally have similar capabilities, perhaps implemented using the Nexus protocols on top of JTAG, or other vendor-specific schemes.

Older ARM7 and ARM9 cores include an &quot;EmbeddedICE&quot; module which combines most of those facilities, but has an awkward mechanism for instruction execution: the debugger must drive the CPU instruction pipeline, clock by clock, and directly access the data buses to read and write data to the CPU. The ARM11 uses the same model for trace support (ETM, ETB) as those older cores.

Newer ARM Cortex cores closely resemble this debug model, but build on a &quot;Debug Access Port&quot; (DAP) instead of direct CPU access. In this architecture (named &quot;CoreSight Technology&quot;), core and JTAG module is completely independent. They are also decoupled from JTAG so they can be hosted over ARM&#x27;s two-wire SWD interface (see below) instead of just the six-wire JTAG interface. (ARM takes the four standard JTAG signals and adds the optional TRST, plus the RTCK signal used for adaptive clocking.) The CoreSight JTAG-DP is asynchronous to the core clocks, and does not implement RTCK. Also, the newer cores have updated trace support.

=== Halt mode debugging ===
One basic way to debug software is to present a single-threaded model, where the debugger periodically stops execution of the program and examines its state as exposed by register contents and memory (including peripheral controller registers). When interesting program events approach, a person may want to single step instructions (or lines of source code) to watch how a particular misbehavior happens.

So for example a JTAG host might HALT the core, entering debug mode, and then read CPU registers using ITR and DCC. After saving processor state, it could write those registers with whatever values it needs, then execute arbitrary algorithms on the CPU, accessing memory and peripherals to help characterize the system state. After the debugger performs those operations, the state may be restored and execution continued using the RESTART instruction.

Debug mode is also entered asynchronously by the debug module triggering a watchpoint or breakpoint, or by issuing a BKPT (breakpoint) instruction from the software being debugged. When it is not being used for instruction tracing, the ETM can also trigger entry to debug mode; it supports complex triggers sensitive to state and history, as well as the simple address comparisons exposed by the debug module. Asynchronous transitions to debug mode are detected by polling the DSCR register. This is how single stepping is implemented: HALT the core, set a temporary breakpoint at the next instruction or next high-level statement, RESTART, poll DSCR until you detect asynchronous entry to debug state, remove that temporary breakpoint, repeat.

=== Monitor mode debugging ===
Modern software is often too complex to work well with such a single-threaded model. For example, a processor used to control a motor (perhaps one driving a saw blade) may not be able to safely enter halt mode; it may need to continue handling interrupts to ensure physical safety of people and/or machinery. Issuing a HALT instruction using JTAG might be dangerous.

ARM processors support an alternative debug mode, called &quot;Monitor Mode&quot;, to work with such situations. (This is distinct from the &quot;Secure Monitor Mode&quot; implemented as part of security extensions on newer ARM cores; it manages debug operations, not security transitions.) In those cases, breakpoints and watchpoints trigger a special kind of hardware exception, transferring control to a &quot;debug monitor&quot; running as part of the system software. This monitor communicates with the debugger using the DCC and could arrange for example to single step only a single process while other processes (and interrupt handlers) continue running.

== Common extensions ==
Microprocessor vendors have often defined their own core-specific debugging extensions. Such vendors include Infineon, MIPS with EJTAG, and more. If the vendor does not adopt a standard (such as the ones used by ARM processors; or Nexus), they need to define their own solution. If they support boundary scan, they generally build debugging over JTAG.

Freescale has COP and OnCE (On-Chip Emulation). OnCE includes a JTAG command which makes a TAP enter a special mode where the IR holds OnCE debugging commands for operations such as single stepping, breakpointing, and accessing registers or memory. It also defines EOnCE (Enhanced On-Chip Emulation) presented as addressing real-time concerns.

ARM has an extensive processor core debug architecture (CoreSight) that started with EmbeddedICE (a debug facility available on most ARM cores), and now includes a number of additional components such as an ETM (Embedded Trace Macrocell), with a high-speed trace port, supporting multi-core and multithread tracing. Note that tracing is non-invasive; systems do not need to stop operating to be traced. (However, trace data is too voluminous to use JTAG as more than a trace control channel.)

Nexus defines a processor debug infrastructure which is largely vendor-independent. One of its hardware interfaces is JTAG. It also defines a high-speed auxiliary port interface, used for tracing and more. Nexus is used with some newer platforms, such as the Atmel AVR32 and Freescale MPC5500 series processors.

== Uses ==
* Except for some of the very lowest-end systems, essentially all embedded systems platforms have a JTAG port to support in-circuit debugging and firmware programming as well as for boundary scan testing:
** ARM architecture processors come with JTAG support, sometimes supporting a two-wire SWD variant or high-speed tracing of traffic on instruction or data buses.
** Modern 8-bit and 16-bit microcontroller chips, such as Atmel AVR and TI MSP430 chips, support JTAG programming and debugging. However, the very smallest chips may not have enough pins to spare (and thus tend to rely on proprietary single-wire programming interfaces); if the pin count is over 32, there is probably a JTAG option.
** Almost all FPGAs and CPLDs used today can be programmed via a JTAG port. A Standard Test and Programming Language is defined by JEDEC standard JESD-71 for JTAG programming of PLD&#x27;s.
** Multiple MIPS and PowerPC processors have JTAG support
** Intel Core, Xeon, Atom, and Quark processors all support JTAG probe mode with Intel-specific extensions of JTAG using the so-called 60-pin eXtended Debug Port [XDP]. Additionally, the Quark processor supports more traditional 10-pin connectors.
** Consumer products such as networking appliances and satellite television integrated receiver/decoders often use microprocessors that support JTAG, providing an alternate means to reload firmware if the existing bootloader has been corrupted in some manner.
*The PCI bus connector standard contains optional JTAG signals on pins 1–5; PCI Express contains JTAG signals on pins 5–9. A special JTAG card can be used to reflash a corrupt BIOS.
* Boundary scan testing and in-system (device) programming applications are sometimes programmed using the Serial Vector Format, a textual representation of JTAG operations using a simple syntax. Other programming formats include &#x27;JAM&#x27; and STAPL plus more recently the IEEE Std. 1532 defined format &#x27;ISC&#x27; (short for In-System Configuration). ISC format is used in conjunction with enhanced BSDL models for programmable logic devices (i.e. FPGAs and CPLDs) that include additional ISC_&lt;operation&gt; instructions in addition to the basic bare minimum IEEE 1149.1 instructions. FPGA programming tools from Xilinx, Altera, Lattice, Cypress, Actel, etc. typically are able to export such files.
* As mentioned, a number of boards include JTAG connectors, or just pads, to support manufacturing operations, where boundary scan testing helps verify board quality (identifying bad solder joints, etc.) and to initialize flash memory or FPGAs.
* JTAG can also support field updates and troubleshooting.

== Client support ==
The target&#x27;s JTAG interface is accessed using some JTAG-enabled application and some JTAG adapter hardware. There is a wide range of such hardware, optimized for purposes such as production testing, debugging high-speed systems, low cost microcontroller development, and so on. In the same way, the software used to drive such hardware can be quite varied. Software developers mostly use JTAG for debugging and updating firmware.

=== Connectors ===

There are no official standards for JTAG adapter physical connectors. Development boards usually include a header to support preferred development tools; in some cases, they include multiple such headers because they need to support multiple such tools. For example, a microcontroller, FPGA, and ARM application processor rarely share tools, so a development board using all of those components might have three or more headers. Production boards may omit the headers, or when space is limited may provide JTAG signal access using test points.

Some common pinouts for pin headers are:

* ARM 2×10 pin (or sometimes the older 2×7), used by almost all ARM-based systems
* MIPS EJTAG (2×7 pin) used for MIPS based systems
* 2×5 pin Altera ByteBlaster-compatible JTAG extended by multiple vendors
* 2×5 pin AVR extends Altera JTAG with SRST (and in some cases TRST and an event output)
* 2×7 pin Texas Instruments used with DSPs and ARM-based products such as OMAP
* 8 pin (single row) generic PLD JTAG compatible with multiple Lattice ispDOWNLOAD cables
* MIPI10-/20-connectors (1.27 mm 050&quot;) for JTAG, cJTAG and SWD

Those connectors tend to include more than just the four standardized signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO). Usually reset signals are provided, one or both of TRST (TAP reset) and SRST (system reset). The connector usually provides the board-under-test&#x27;s logic supply voltage so that the JTAG adapters use the appropriate logic levels. The board voltage may also serve as a &quot;board present&quot; debugger input. Other event input or output signals may be provided, or general purpose I/O (GPIO) lines, to support more complex debugging architectures.

Higher end products frequently use dense connectors (frequently 38-pin MICTOR connectors) to support high-speed tracing in conjunction with JTAG operations. A recent trend is to have development boards integrate a USB interface to JTAG, where a second channel is used for a serial port. (Smaller boards can also be powered through USB. Since modern PCs tend to omit serial ports, such integrated debug links can significantly reduce clutter for developers.) Production boards often rely on bed-of-nails connections to test points for testing and programming.

=== Adapter hardware ===
Adapter hardware varies widely. When not integrated into a development board, it involves a short cable to attach to a JTAG connector on the target board; a connection to the debugging host, such as a USB, PCI, or Ethernet link; and enough electronics to adapt the two communications domains (and sometimes provide galvanic isolation). A separate power supply may be needed. There are both &quot;dumb&quot; adapters, where the host decides and performs all JTAG operations; and &quot;smart&quot; ones, where some of that work is performed inside the adapter, often driven by a microcontroller. The &quot;smart&quot; adapters eliminate link latencies for operation sequences that may involve polling for status changes between steps, and may accordingly offer higher throughput.

, adapters with a USB link from the host are the most common approach. Higher-end products often support Ethernet, with the advantage that the debug host can be quite remote. Adapters that support high-speed trace ports generally include several megabytes of trace buffer and provide high-speed links (USB or Ethernet) to get that data to the host.

Parallel port adapters are simple and inexpensive, but they are relatively slow because they use the host CPU to change each bit (&quot;bit banging&quot;). They have declined in usefulness because most computers in recent years don&#x27;t have a parallel port. Driver support is also a problem because pin usage by adapters varied widely. Since the parallel port is based on 5V logic level, most adapters lacked voltage translation support for 3.3V or 1.8V target voltages.

RS-232 serial port adapters also exist and are similarly declining in usefulness. They generally involve either slower bit banging than a parallel port, or a microcontroller translating some command protocol to JTAG operations. Such serial adapters are also not fast, but their command protocols could generally be reused on top of higher-speed links.

With all JTAG adapters, software support is a basic concern. Some vendors do not publish the protocols used by their JTAG adapter hardware, limiting their customers to the tool chains supported by those vendors. This is a particular issue for &quot;smart&quot; adapters, some of which embed significant amounts of knowledge about how to interact with specific CPUs.

=== Software development ===
Most development environments for embedded software include JTAG support. There are, broadly speaking, three sources of such software:

* &quot;Chip vendors&quot; may provide the tools, usually requiring a JTAG adapter they supply. Examples include FPGA vendors such as Xilinx and Altera, Atmel for its AVR8 and AVR32 product lines, and Texas Instruments for most of its DSP and micro products. Such tools tend to be highly featured and may be the only real option for highly specialized chips like FPGAs and DSPs. Lower-end software tools may be provided free of charge. The JTAG adapters themselves are not free, although sometimes they are bundled with development boards.
* &quot;Tool vendors&quot; may supply them, usually in conjunction with multiple chip vendors to provide cross-platform development support. ARM-based products have a particularly rich third-party market, and a number of those vendors have expanded to non-ARM platforms like MIPS and PowerPC. Tool vendors sometimes build products around free software like GCC and GDB, with GUI support frequently using Eclipse. JTAG adapters are sometimes sold along with support bundles.
* &quot;Open source&quot; tools exist. As noted above, GCC and GDB form the core of a good toolchain, and there are GUI environments to support them.

All such software tends to include basic debugger support: stopping, halting, single stepping, breakpoints, data structure browsing, and so on.
Commercial tools tend to provide tools like very accurate simulators and trace analysis, which are not currently available as open source.

== Similar interface standards ==

Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is an alternative 2-pin electrical interface that uses the same protocol. It uses the existing GND connection. SWD uses an ARM CPU standard bi-directional wire protocol, defined in the ARM Debug Interface v5. This enables the debugger to become another AMBA bus master for access to system memory and peripheral or debug registers. Data rate is up to . SWD also has built-in error detection. On JTAG devices with SWD capability, the TMS and TCK are used as SWDIO and SWCLK signals, providing for dual-mode programmers.

<text>Field Marshal William Riddell Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood (13 September 1865 – 17 May 1951), was a British Army officer. He saw active service in the Second Boer War on the staff of Lord Kitchener. He saw action again in the First World War as commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, leading the landings on the peninsula and then the evacuation later in the year, before becoming commander-in-chief of the Fifth Army on the Western Front during the closing stages of the war. He went on to be general officer commanding the Northern Army in India in 1920 and Commander-in-Chief, India, in 1925.

==Early life==
William Riddell Birdwood was born on 13 September 1865 in Kirkee, India. His father, Herbert Mills Birdwood, born in Bombay and educated in the UK, had returned to India in 1859 after passing the Indian Civil Service examination. In 1861, Herbert Birdwood married Edith Marion Sidonie, the eldest daughter of Surgeon-Major Elijah George Halhed Impey of the Bombay Horse Artillery and postmaster-general of the Bombay Presidency. They had five sons and a daughter; William was their second son. At the time of William&#x27;s birth, his father held positions in the Bombay legislative council, and went on to become a Bombay high court judge. William Birdwood was educated at Clifton College.

==Military career==
After securing a militia commission in the 4th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1883, Birdwood trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he was commissioned early, owing to the Russian war scare of 1885, becoming a lieutenant in the 12th (Prince of Wales&#x27;s) Royal Lancers on 9 May 1885. He joined his regiment in India and then transferred from the 12th Royal Lancers to the Bengal Staff Corps on 20 December 1886. He subsequently transferred to the 11th Bengal Lancers in 1887, seeing action on the North-West Frontier in 1891. He later became adjutant of the Viceroy&#x27;s Bodyguard in 1893. He was promoted to captain on 9 May 1896 and saw action during the Tirah Campaign in 1897.

Birdwood served in the Second Boer War, initially as brigade-major with a mounted brigade in Natal from 10 January 1900 and then as Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General on the staff of Lord Kitchener from 15 October 1900. Promoted to brevet major on 20 November 1901 and local lieutenant-colonel in October 1901, he became military secretary to Lord Kitchener on 5 June 1902, and followed him on his return to the United Kingdom on board the SS &quot;Orotava&quot;, which arrived in Southampton on 12 July 1902. He received a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902. In a despatch from June 1902, Lord Kitchener wrote the following about his work in South Africa:
:This young officer has held a difficult position as Assistant Adjutant-General, Mounted Troops, and responsible adviser as to the distribution of remounts. In carrying out these duties he has proved himself to possess exceptional ability, and he has shown, moreover, remarkable tact in dealing with and conciliating the various interests which he had to take into consideration.

When Kitchener went to India as commander-in-chief in November 1902, Birdwood joined him there as assistant military secretary and interpreter. He was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 9 May 1903 and appointed Military Secretary to Lord Kitchener with the rank of full colonel on 26 June 1905. Having been appointed an aide-de-camp to the King on 14 February 1906, he was given command of the Kohat Brigade on the North West Frontier in 1908 and promoted to temporary brigadier-general on 28 June 1909.

Promoted to the rank of major-general on 3 October 1911, Birdwood became quartermaster-general in India and a member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Legislative Council in 1912 and then Secretary of the Indian Army Department in 1913.

===Gallipoli===

In November 1914 Birdwood was instructed by Kitchener to form an army corps from the Australian and New Zealand troops that were training in Egypt. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant-general on 12 December 1914 and given command of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. Kitchener instructed General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, to carry out an operation to capture the Gallipoli peninsula and placed Birdwood&#x27;s ANZAC Corps under Hamilton&#x27;s command. Hamilton ordered Birdwood to carry out a landing on 25 April 1915 north of Kabatepe at a site now known as ANZAC Cove. The ANZAC Corps encountered high ridges, narrow gullies, dense scrub and strong Ottoman resistance and became pinned down. Major-General William Bridges and Major-General Alexander Godley, the divisional commanders, were both of the view that the Allied forces, dealing with stiffer-than-expected resistance, should be evacuated ahead of an expected attack by the Ottoman Army. Nevertheless, Hamilton ordered them to hold fast.

Birdwood took effective command of the First Australian Imperial Force in May 1915 while still commanding Allied troops on the ground at Gallipoli. He launched a major attack on Ottoman positions in August 1915 (the Battle of Sari Bair) but failed to dislodge them from the peninsula. Notwithstanding this, Birdwood was the only corps commander opposed to abandoning Gallipoli. He was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant-general on 28 October 1915 and given command of the newly formed Dardanelles Army: the one outstanding success of the campaign was the evacuation led by Birdwood, which took place in December 1915 and January 1916, when the entire force was withdrawn before any Ottoman reaction.

===Western Front===
In February 1916 the Australian and New Zealand contingents, back in Egypt, underwent reorganisation to incorporate the new units and reinforcements that had accumulated during 1915: the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps was replaced by two corps, I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps, and Birdwood reverted to the command of II ANZAC Corps. When I ANZAC Corps became the first to depart for France, Birdwood, as senior corps commander, took over command. During early 1916 Birdwood advocated for the formation of an Australian and New Zealand Army or a Dominion Army also including Canadian forces under his command, but this did not occur.

Birdwood was promoted to the permanent rank of full general on 23 October 1917 with command of a formation then known as the Australian Corps in November 1917. He was also appointed aide-de-camp general to the King on 2 November 1917 and given command of the British Fifth Army on 31 May 1918 and led the Army at the liberation of Lille in October 1918 and at the liberation of Tournai in November 1918.

==After the war==
Birdwood was made a Baronet, of Anzac and of Totnes, in the County of Devon, on 29 December 1919. He toured Australia to great acclaim in 1920 and then became general officer commanding the Northern Army in India in October of that year. He was promoted to field marshal (with the corresponding honorary rank in the Australian Military Forces) on 20 March 1925 and, having been appointed a Member of the Executive Council of the Governor-General of India in July 1925, he went on to be Commander-in-Chief, India, in August 1925.

After leaving the service in 1930, Birdwood made a bid to become Governor-General of Australia. He had the backing of the King and the British government. However, the Australian Prime Minister James Scullin insisted that his Australian nominee Sir Isaac Isaacs be appointed. Instead, Birdwood was appointed Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge on 20 April 1931 and Captain of Deal Castle in 1934. In 1935 he wrote for the Western Australian distance education magazine &quot;Our Rural Magazine&quot;, saying that he had two granddaughters making good use of distance educational courses. In May 1936, he returned to Gallipoli aboard RMS &quot;Lancastria&quot; and visited war memorials on the peninsula. He retired from academic work in 1938.

In retirement Birdwood was Colonel of the 12th Royal Lancers (1920–1951), the 6th Gurkha Rifles (1926–1951), and the 75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (1939–1951). In January 1936 he attended the funeral of King George V and in May 1937 he was present for the coronation of King George VI. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Birdwood, of Anzac and of Totnes in the County of Devon, on 25 January 1938, in recognition of his wartime service.

His autobiography &quot;Khaki and Gown&quot; (1941) was followed by &quot;In my time: recollections and anecdotes&quot; (1946). Lord Birdwood died at Hampton Court Palace, where he lived in grace-and-favour apartments, on 17 May 1951. He was buried at Twickenham Cemetery with full military honours; the Australian Government pays for the upkeep of his grave.

Their son, Christopher Birdwood (1899–1962), succeeded him as 2nd Baron Birdwood. The elder daughter was Constance &#x27;Nancy&#x27; Birdwood, and the younger daughter was Judith Birdwood. Other members of the Birdwood family include Labour minister and peer Christopher Birdwood Thomson (1875–1930), Anglo-Indian naturalist Sir George Birdwood (1832–1917), and Jane Birdwood (1913–2000), the second wife of William Birdwood&#x27;s son.

== Legacy ==
The town of Blumberg, South Australia, changed its German name to Birdwood in 1918, and the soldier settlement of Birdwoodton, Victoria, was named after Birdwood in 1920. Mount Birdwood in Alberta, Canada, also bears his name.

Birdwood House in Geraldton, Western Australia, which was built in 1935 for the Geraldton RSL and named after Birdwood, has served as the centre of ANZAC Day commemorations in Geraldton since 1936. William Birdwood visited Birdwood House in Geraldton 1937 where he was presented with a gold key and Freedom of Birdwood House. Birdwood House became Heritage Registered in 2016.

Many streets and public spaces in Australia and New Zealand are named or commonly believed to be named after Birdwood, including Birdwood Park in Newcastle West in 1920 and a street in New Lambton in 1919.

<doc id="638120" wikidata="Q194609" url="?curid=638120" title="Sarcophilus laniarius">
<text>Sarcophilus laniarius is an extinct species of marsupial in the genus &quot;Sarcophilus&quot;. It is therefore closely related to the Tasmanian devil (&quot;S. harrisii&quot;). Richard Owen originally named the species &quot;Dasyurus laniarus&quot;.

Pleistocene fossil deposits in limestone caves at Naracoorte, South Australia include specimens of &quot;S. laniarius&quot;, which were around 15% larger and 50% heavier than modern devils. Older specimens believed to be 50–70,000 years old were found in Darling Downs in Queensland and in Western Australia. It is not clear whether the modern devil evolved from &quot;S. laniarius&quot;, or whether they coexisted at the time. Richard Owen argued for the latter hypothesis in the 19th century based on fossils found in 1877 in New South Wales. It has been conjectured that &quot;S. laniarius&quot; and &quot;S. moornaensis&quot;, another now-extinct larger species, may have hunted and scavenged. It is known that there were several genera and species of thylacine millions of years ago, and that they ranged in size, the smaller being more reliant on foraging. As the devil and thylacine are similar, the extinction of the co-existing thylacine species has been cited as evidence for an analogous history for the devils. It has been speculated that the smaller size of &quot;S. laniarius&quot; and &quot;S. moornaensis&quot; allowed them to adapt to the changing conditions more effectively and survive longer than the corresponding thylacines.

As the extinction of these two species came at a similar time to human habitation of Australia, hunting by humans, as well as land clearing, have been mooted as possible causes. Critics of this theory point out that as indigenous Australians only developed boomerangs and spears for hunting around 10,000 years ago, a critical fall in numbers due to systemic hunting is unlikely. They also point out that caves inhabited by Aboriginal people have a low proportion of bones and rock paintings of devils, and that this is an indication that it was not a large part of indigenous lifestyle. A scientific report in 1910 claimed that Aboriginal people preferred the meat of herbivores rather than carnivores. The other main theory for the extinction was due to the climate change brought on by the most recent Ice Age.

<text>Timothy Buck (January 6, 1891 – March 11, 1973) was the general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada (known as the Labor-Progressive Party from 1943 to 1959) from 1929 until 1962. Together with Ernst Thälmann of Germany, Maurice Thorez of France, Palmiro Togliatti of Italy, Earl Browder of the United States, and Harry Pollitt of Great Britain, Buck was one of the top leaders of the Joseph Stalin-era Communist International.

== Early life and career ==
A machinist by trade, Buck was born in Beccles, England, and emigrated to Canada in 1910 reputedly because it was cheaper to book steamship passage to Canada than to Australia. He became involved in the labour movement and joined the International Association of Machinists and radical working-class politics in Toronto. He claimed to have been present at the founding convention of the Communist Party of Canada, though this is disputed. Not initially a leading member of the party, Buck came to prominence as a supporter of Joseph Stalin, and became General Secretary in 1929, after the old party leadership had been purged for supporting Leon Trotsky, and others removed for supporting Bukharin. Buck remained General Secretary until 1962 and was a committed supporter of the Soviet line throughout his tenure.

== National figure ==

In 1928, Buck was expelled from the International Association of Machinists for being a member of the Communist Party of Canada. With the onset of the Great Depression, the Conservative government of R. B. Bennett became increasingly worried about left-wing activity and agitation. On August 11, 1931, the Communist Party offices in Toronto were raided, and Buck and several of his colleagues were arrested and charged with sedition. Buck was tried in November, convicted of sedition and sentenced to hard labour.

He was imprisoned from 1932 to 1934 in Kingston Penitentiary where he was the target of an apparent assassination attempt in his cell the night after a prison riot. While Buck was sitting in his cell listening to the mêlée outside, eight shots were fired into his cell via a window, narrowly missing the prisoner. In late 1933, Minister of Justice Hugh Guthrie admitted in the House of Commons of Canada that shots had been deliberately fired into Buck&#x27;s cell but &quot;just to frighten him.&quot; A widespread civil rights campaign ultimately secured Buck&#x27;s release. His extensive testimony before the Archambault Commission contributed to the reform of prisons in Canada. As a result, Buck was hailed a heroic champion of civil liberties.

The Communist Party was banned in 1941 under the Defence of Canada Regulations. Buck and other prominent communist leaders were forced underground and ultimately into exile in the United States because of their support for the pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, both of which invaded Poland at the start of the Second World War. Like supporters and immigrants from the Axis Powers, communists were suspected of collusion with Germany, and all who suspected of strongly supporting the alliance were interned under the War Measures Act. The political environment began to change only after German invaded the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union&#x27;s entry into World War II on the side of the Allies caused Canadian communists to end their opposition to the war and apparently to become enthusiastic supporters of the Canadian war effort. The party supported the government&#x27;s call for conscription and established Tim Buck Plebiscite Committees, which called for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the 1942 national plebiscite on conscription. The campaigning in support of the war helped change public opinion towards the communists and resulted in the government&#x27;s release of communist leaders being held in detention and the return of Buck and other leaders from exile. The ban on the party itself was not lifted, but it was allowed to organize the Labor-Progressive Party as its legal public face.

== Electoral politics ==
Buck ran for a seat in the House of Commons on five occasions and once for the Toronto city Board of Control, all unsuccessfully.

in the 1935 federal election, he ran in Winnipeg North and won 25% of the vote, placing third. He lost to Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) candidate Abraham Albert Heaps.

In the 1937 Toronto municipal election he came within 200 votes of winning a citywide election to the Toronto Board of Control.

He won 26% of the vote when he ran in the Toronto riding of Trinity in the 1945 election, and 21% in the 1949 election, finishing ahead of the CCF on both occasions.

In the 1953 election, he won only 8.7% of the vote and then just 3.7% of the vote when he stood one last time in the 1958 election.

== Retirement and death ==
Buck retired as general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada in 1962 but remained in the largely ceremonial position of party chairman until his death in 1973. There was controversy within the party when a posthumous version of his memoirs was published in 1977 by NC Press based on interviews conducted for the CBC in 1965. In &quot;Yours in the Struggle: Reminiscences of Tim Buck,&quot; the former party leader criticized Nikita Khrushchev and was somewhat defensive of Stalin, although not departing from the international Communist movement&#x27;s current perspective.

The main concerns of the party was the claim that the publishers were trying to frame Buck in a pro-Maoist manner, in regards to the Sino-Soviet Split where the party had sided with the Soviet Union, and that the loose recordings were in a position to be easily misinterpreted. Those within the Central Committee responsible for its publication were punished for &quot;grave violation of democratic centralism&quot;. Earlier in 1975, Progress Books published &quot;Tim Buck — A Conscience for Canada&quot; by Oscar Ryan, which is considered to be the party-approved biography. In it, Buck was quoted as saying &quot;for a time I gave the appearance of defending Stalin. I didn&#x27;t defend what he had done; the fact is, nobody could defend the things that Khrushchev revealed.&quot;

Canadian Trotskyist Ian Angus also criticized &quot;Yours in Struggle&quot; with regards to accusations that Buck had stated misinformation with regards to the purging of alternate voices during his early rise in the party. He continued this criticism with his 1981 book &quot;Canadian Bolsheviks: The Early Years of the Communist Party of Canada&quot;, which analyzed the formation and rise of the party, but felt that Tim Buck had betrayed it by promoting himself and a strongly pro-Soviet line.

Buck died in Cuernavaca, Mexico, on March 11, 1973, at age 82.

<text>James Allen Rhodes (September 13, 1909 – March 4, 2001) was an American attorney and Republican politician who served as the 61st and 63rd Governor of Ohio from 1963 to 1971 and from 1975 to 1983. Rhodes was one of only seven U.S. governors to serve four four-year terms in office. Rhodes is tied for the sixth-longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,840 days. He also served as Mayor of Columbus from 1944 to 1952 and Ohio State Auditor from 1953 to 1963.

On May 3, 1970, Rhodes sent National Guard troops onto the Kent State University campus at the request of Kent, Ohio mayor LeRoy Satrom after the ROTC building was burned down by unknown arsonists the previous night. On May 4, Guardsmen killed four students and wounded nine others.

== Early life and education ==
Rhodes was born in Coalton, Ohio, to James and Susan Howe Rhodes, who were of Welsh descent. Rhodes has commented that the reason he and his family were Republicans was because of the respect his father, a mine superintendent, had for John L. Lewis, a prominent Republican union activist. When Rhodes was nine, his father died, and the family moved to north Springfield where Rhodes graduated from Springfield High School where he played on the football team. Subsequently, the family moved again, this time to Columbus, because Rhodes earned a modest basketball scholarship to Ohio State University. Although Rhodes dropped out after his first quarter he is often described as a &quot;student&quot; or &quot;alumnus&quot; of Ohio State.

After dropping out of college, Rhodes opened a business called Jim&#x27;s Place across from the university on North High Street. Jim&#x27;s Place has been described as a place where one could buy anything, from doughnuts and hamburgers to stag film, or place bets on numbers games.

== Political career ==

=== Mayor of Columbus, 1944–1952 ===
In 1934, Rhodes began to use his position as a local businessman to climb up the Columbus political ladder, starting on a ward committee. In 1937, Rhodes won his first elected office as a member of the Columbus Board of Education. He was then twice elected as Columbus city auditor in 1939 and 1941. Then in 1943, Rhodes was elected as Mayor of Columbus, becoming the youngest major city mayor in the U.S. at age 34.

Rhodes&#x27;s time as mayor is primarily marked by two achievements, with the first being his convincing of 67% of Columbus voters to approve the city&#x27;s first income tax, and the second being the annexation of much of the surrounding suburbs to Columbus. As surrounding communities grew or were constructed, they came to require access to waterlines, which was under the sole control of the municipal water system. Rhodes told these communities that if they wanted water, they would have to submit to assimilation into Columbus. As a result of this, Columbus, Ohio, currently has the largest land area of any Ohio city.

=== Governor of Ohio ===
With an eye on the governorship, Rhodes was elected State Auditor in 1952, and took office in early 1953. In 1954, Rhodes ran against the popular incumbent, Democratic governor Frank Lausche, and lost by a 54% to 46% margin. In 1962, Rhodes ran again for governor – this time against Democratic incumbent Mike DiSalle. Rhodes&#x27;s campaign centered on &quot;jobs and progress,&quot; and in speeches Rhodes routinely claimed that an increase in jobs would lead to a decrease in everything from crime and divorce, to mental illness. Rhodes also made DiSalle&#x27;s tax increases, such as the gas tax, a prominent part of his campaign. Rhodes also weathered a minor scandal when Democratic State Chairman alleged that Rhodes diverted and borrowed a total of $54,000 from his campaign funds. During a debate, both Rhodes and DiSalle agreed that this was, &quot;the most vicious campaign [of] the Ohio governorship.&quot; On November 6, 1962, Ohioans voted Rhodes into the governorship with 59% of the vote.

Rhodes served two terms as governor, and he also was a &quot;favorite son&quot; presidential candidate who controlled the Ohio delegation to the Republican National Conventions in 1964 and 1968, before retiring in 1971. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1970 and narrowly lost, to U.S. Representative Robert Taft Jr., in the primary election, which was two days after the events at Kent State.

Rhodes oversaw the last two (by electrocution) pre-Furman executions in Ohio, which were both in early 1963, before Ohio resumed executions in 1999. In 1983 Rhodes pardoned boxing promoter Don King for a 1967 non‐negligent manslaughter conviction of stomping one of his employees to death.

Rhodes championed a county airport program which, after being passed by voters in 1965, saw the construction of 50 airports throughout the state.

At a news conference in Kent, Ohio, on Sunday May 3, 1970, the day before the Kent State shootings, he said of campus protesters:

They&#x27;re worse than the Brownshirts, and the Communist element, and also the Night Riders, and the vigilantes. They&#x27;re the worst type of people that we harbor in America.

Since the Ohio Constitution limits the governor to two four-year terms, when Rhodes initially filed to run again in 1974, his petitions were refused by the Secretary of State. Rhodes sued, and the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the limitation was on consecutive terms, thus freeing him to return to office by narrowly defeating incumbent John Gilligan in an upset in the 1974 election. He served two more terms before retiring again in 1983. During the energy crisis of the winter of 1976–77, Rhodes led a 15-minute service, in which he &quot;beseech[ed] God to relieve the storm.&quot; The next year, January 1978, amid a blizzard which dropped 31 inches of snow onto Ohio and killed 60 people in the Northeast, Rhodes called the storm &quot;the greatest disaster in Ohio history.&quot;

On August 16, 1977 Rhodes was hit in the face and shoulder with a banana cream pie thrown by Steve Conliff, as about 25 young people disrupted the opening of the Ohio State Fair. Conliff then ran unsuccessfully against Rhodes for the Republican nomination.

After relations between the United States and People&#x27;s Republic of China normalized in 1979, Rhodes sought to encourage economic ties, viewing China as a potential market for Ohio machinery exports for companies like Timken Company and Parker Hannifin. In July 1979, Rhodes led a State of Ohio Trade Mission to China. Among other leaders, Rhodes met with Vice Premier Yu Qiuli. The trip resulted in developing economic ties, a sister state-province relationship with Hubei province, long-running Chinese exhibitions at the Ohio State Fair, and major academic exchanges between Ohio State University and Wuhan University. Rhodes also developed the view that Chinese investment in Ohio would be beneficial for the state.

Rhodes ran for the governorship again in 1986, seeking a record-breaking fifth term, but soundly lost to the incumbent Dick Celeste, whom Rhodes had narrowly defeated in his last successful gubernatorial bid in 1978.

==Literary==
Rhodes co-authored stories of historical fiction with Dean Jauchius, including &quot;The Trial of Mary Todd Lincoln&quot;, &quot;The Court-Martial of Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; and &quot;Johnny Shiloh, a novel of the Civil War&quot;. The last was adapted to a 1963 television movie by Walt Disney, also called &quot;Johnny Shiloh&quot;, for which Rhodes received writer&#x27;s credit.

==Personal life==
From 1941 to her death in 1987, Rhodes was married to Helen Rawlins. They had three children.

In 1995, Rhodes suffered a stroke, resulting in him needing to use a wheelchair. He was hospitalized due to pneumonia in December 2000 and January 2001. On March 4, 2001, Rhodes died at Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus of heart issues. He is interred at Green Lawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio.

==Legacy==
Numerous buildings and sites around the state have been named in Rhodes&#x27;s honor, including:

*The James A. Rhodes State Office Tower – the tallest building in Columbus
*Statue in front of namesake office tower in Columbus
*Cleveland State University&#x27;s Rhodes Tower in Cleveland

<doc id="638131" wikidata="Q1982008" url="?curid=638131" title="Karnov">
<text>is a platform game released in arcades in 1987. A Nintendo Entertainment System port followed. Players take control of the title character Jinborov Karnovski, or &quot;Karnov&quot; for short. Karnov is a strongman popularly illustrated as being from an unspecified part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Central Asian republics as shown on the arcade flyer and again in &quot;Karnov&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

As a character created by Data East, Karnov was reintroduced in several other games from the company, including &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot; in which he is a boss in the first level. Karnov later appeared in the 1993 fighting game &quot;Fighter&#x27;s History&quot;, in which he is the final boss, and as a playable character in its sequel, &quot;Karnov&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, also known as &quot;Fighter&#x27;s History Dynamite&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game&#x27;s hero, Karnov, a muscular fire-breathing ex-circus strongman, goes on a quest through nine different levels to search for the ultimate treasure. However, between him and the treasure are several horrendous monsters, including sword-wielding monks, dinosaurs, djinn, hopping fish men, gargoyles, tree monsters, will-o-wisps, rock creatures, centipede women, and ostrich-riding skeleton warriors.

Karnov can walk, jump, and shoot to make his way through these levels and find special items that help him. Acquiring red orbs can upgrade Karnov until he shoots three fireballs at a time. The end of each level has one or more bosses which he must defeat to receive a new piece of a treasure map. The end of the game features a powerful boss called &quot;The Wizard&quot; who defends the last map piece that leads to the treasure.

==Ports==
&quot;Karnov&quot; was later ported to numerous home systems, such as the NES, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and others.

===IBM PC===
The IBM PC compatibles port was developed by Quicksilver Software. Like Quicksilver&#x27;s other Data East ports, such as &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, and &quot;Guerrilla War&quot;, it was sold as a self-booting disk.

===Famicom/NES===
The Famicom version was co-developed by Data East (design and audio) and SAS Sakata (programming). It was released on December 18, 1987 in Japan by Namco, and shortly thereafter on its North American equivalent, the NES, in 1988 by Data East itself. Although it plays similarly to the arcade game there are some noticeable differences:

* Karnov takes two hits to die instead of just one. After being hit once he will turn a blue color in which he has one hit left or can gain an extra hit back by grabbing a blue fireball orb.
* The Super Fireball is replaced with the Spike Bomb which destroys every enemy on screen. The Trolley item is replaced with the Shield which is used to reflect an enemy&#x27;s fireballs.
* Levels 4 and 8 are completely different from the arcade levels.
* The final boss is no longer the Wizard, but a giant three-headed dragon. Both fights, however, take place in similar rooms.

The Famicom game is noticeably more difficult since it has limited continues, and the option is not visibly present after all lives are lost, instead requiring pressing Select and Start at the same time. The NES game, however, provides unlimited continues, and it also allows Karnov to be killed when both the A and B buttons are pressed on the second controller.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Karnov&quot; on their March 1, 1987 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month. &quot;Karnov&quot;″s sales had surpassed 250,000 copies by November 1989.

Bill Kunkel reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, calling it an off-beat variation on a familiar videogame play mechanic.

The IBM PC version of the game was reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #142 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 4½ out of 5 stars.

==Legacy==
Although no direct sequel to &quot;Karnov&quot; was released, Data East has used the title character as an enemy. In some games, such as &quot;Garyo Retsuden&quot;, &quot;Tumblepop&quot; and &quot;Trio The Punch - Never Forget Me...&quot; (featuring enormous stone statues and even mini versions of the character), Karnov is featured as a regular enemy.

In other Data East games, he is featured as a boss character. In &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot;, Karnov is the first level&#x27;s boss. A pale grey version of Karnov appears later in the game. According to the credits sequence of the Japanese version of the game, this version of Karnov is called Kusamochi Karnov, after the green sweet kusamochi.

Karnov is also the last opponent in the original &quot;Fighter&#x27;s History&quot;, and becomes a playable character in its sequels: &quot;Karnov&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Fighter&#x27;s History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!!&quot;. Although not an official cameo, the guard boss from the Gaelco game, &quot;Big Karnak&quot;, is almost identical to Karnov&#x27;s and Kusamoci Karnov&#x27;s sprites from &quot;Bad Dudes vs. DragonNinja&quot;.

Karnov has also made various cameo appearances. He appears in the alley background of the Neo-Geo game &quot;Street Slam&quot;. He is shown wearing a shirt with a &quot;K&quot; on it. Karnov also appears in the credits of the independently-developed freeware game &quot;I Wanna Be the Guy&quot;. In &quot;Shantae and the Pirate&#x27;s Curse&quot;, a ghostly silhouette who helps the titular character is highly similar to Karnov, and is even implied to be her long-lost father.

<doc id="638132" wikidata="Q2449906" url="?curid=638132" title="Miguel León-Portilla">
<text>Miguel León-Portilla (22 February 1926 – 1 October 2019) was a Mexican anthropologist and historian, specializing in Aztec culture and literature of the pre-Columbian and colonial eras. Many of his works were translated to English and he was a well-recognized scholar internationally. In 2013, the Library of Congress of the United States bestowed on him the Living Legend Award.

==Early life and education==
Born in Mexico City, Miguel León-Portilla had an interest in indigenous Mexico from an early age, fostered by his uncle Manuel Gamio, a distinguished archeologist. Gamio had a lasting influence on his life and career, initially taking him as a boy on trips to important archeological sites in Mexico and later as well. León-Portilla attended the Instituto de Ciencias in Guadalajara and then earned a B.A. (1948) and M.A. summa cum laude (1951) at the Jesuit Loyola University in Los Angeles. Returning to Mexico in 1952, he showed Gamio a play he had written on Quetzalcoatl, which resulted in Gamio introducing his nephew to Ángel Garibay K., whose publications in the 1930s and 1940s first brought Nahuatl literature to widespread public attention in Mexico. Needing to make a living, León-Portilla began attending law school and worked at a financial firm. At the same time he taught at Mexico City College, an English-language school in the Condesa neighborhood. Other instructors included important scholars of Mexican indigenous history and culture, Wigberto Jiménez Moreno, Fernando Horcasitas, and Eduardo Noguera. Gamio persuaded León-Portilla to drop his law studies and job in business to work at the , a specialized organization of the Organization of American States, which Gamio directed. León-Portilla began graduate studies at the UNAM, completing his doctoral dissertation, &quot;La Filosofía Náhuatl estudiada en sus fuentes,&quot; in 1956, which launched his scholarly career.

==Career==
His dissertation on Nahua philosophy was published in Mexico, and then translated to English as &quot;Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind&quot; (1967) and then many other languages. It was the first of his many works to be translated to English. His translations of Nahuatl and Spanish texts on the conquest of Mexico, first published in Mexico as &quot;Visión de los vencidos&quot;, translated to English as &quot;The Broken Spears&quot;, is the way many undergraduate students in the United States are introduced to accounts from indigenous participants and not Spanish conquistadors.

León-Portilla spearheaded a movement to understand and re-evaluate Nahuatl literature and religion, not only from the pre-Columbian era, but also that of the present day, especially since Nahuatl is still spoken by 1.5 million people. His works in English on literature included &quot;Pre-Columbian Literatures of Mexico&quot; (1986), &quot;Fifteen Poets of the Aztec World&quot; (2000), and with Earl Shorris, &quot;In the Language of Kings: An Anthology of Mesoamerican Literature, Pre-Columbian to the Present&quot; (2002). He also compared the literature of the Nahuas with that of the Inca. Another area of research was on indigenous religion and spirituality, with works including &quot;Native Meso-American Spirituality&quot; (1980), and &quot;South and Meso-American Native Spirituality: From the Cult of the Feathered Serpent to the Theology of Liberation&quot; (1997). He also published a work on the Maya, &quot;Time and Reality in the Thought of the Maya&quot; (1990).

León-Portilla was instrumental in bringing to light the works of Franciscan Fr. Bernardino de Sahagún, a 16th-century primary source on the Aztec civilization, whose twelve-volume &quot;General History of the Things of New Spain&quot;, often referred to as the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;, are crucial for understanding Nahua religion, society, and culture, as well as for providing an account of the conquest of Mexico from the Mexica viewpoint. León-Portilla was the first to denote Sahagún as the &quot;Father of Anthropology in the New World&quot;.

He contributed to the understanding of the development of the field of Mesoamerican history in Mexico. With Garibay, León-Portilla made contributions to the study of nineteenth-century Mesoamerican historian Manuel Orozco y Berra. León-Portilla also published two volumes on the work of Mesoamerican humanists, including his mentor Garibay.

In the field of colonial Nahuatl studies, particularly the New Philology, León-Portilla&#x27;s work on a collection of late sixteenth-century wills in Nahuatl, &quot;The Testaments of Culhuacan&quot;, contributed to the understanding of local-level interactions within a Nahua town.

A subordinate but important interest of León-Portilla was the early history and ethnography of the Baja California Peninsula. He addressed this region in more than 30 books and articles, including a 1995 volume collecting several of his earlier publications.

Early in his academic career in 1969, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. That was the first of many academic awards and recognitions, including the Belisario Domínguez Medal of Honor, the highest award bestowed by the Mexican Senate. In 1970, he was elected to membership of Mexico&#x27;s National College and, in 1995, to membership of the United States National Academy of Sciences. From 1987 to 1992, he served as his country&#x27;s permanent delegate to UNESCO, during which time he successfully nominated five pre-Columbian sites in Mexico for inclusion on the World Heritage List.
On 12 December 2013, León-Portilla received the Living Legend Award from the U.S. Library of Congress. He was also a member of the Mexican Academy of Language and the Mexican Academy of History.

==Personal life==
León-Portilla married Ascensión Hernández Triviño, a Spanish linguist and academic, in 1965. Their daughter, Marisa León-Portilla, is also a historian.

León-Portilla died in Mexico City on 1 October 2019 after having been hospitalized for much of the year.
The federal Secretariat of Culture announced that his body would lie in state on 3 October 2019 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes.

==Notable works==
León-Portilla wrote more than a 150 articles and more than forty books. A select list is below. 

* (In English: &quot;The Nahuatl Philosophy studied in its sources&quot;; 1956). Based on his doctoral dissertation, it has been edited at least ten times, and it also has been translated to English, Italian, Russian and German. León-Portilla explained that, the Mexica Tribes, didn&#x27;t have a proper form of &quot;philosophy&quot; as known in the modern world, their (Nahuatl sages) attempted to comprehend the world, asking themselves questions and searching about it. León-Portilla stated that, what Europeans understood as many gods, Aztecs, in fact perceived those many gods as a single entity called Ometeotl/Omecihuatl (Our Lord/Our Lady of Duality). This thesis was later extended in &quot;&quot; (In English: &quot;Aztec Thought and Culture: Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind&quot;)
* (In English: &quot;Seven Essays about Nahuatl Culture&quot;; 1958)
* (In English: &quot;The Broken Spears&quot;; 1959). His most popular and famous work until 2008 has been published twenty-nine times and translated into a dozen languages. In this short book, León-Portilla brings together several fragments of the Nahuatl vision of the Spanish conquest, from Moctezuma&#x27;s premonitions to the sad songs () after the conquest. On 25 June 2009, the fiftieth anniversary of its first edition was celebrated in an event organized by the National Council for Culture and the Arts, the National Institute of Anthropology and History, the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the National College

<text>Product data management (PDM) is the name of a business function within product lifecycle management (PLM) that denotes the management and publication of product data. In software engineering, this is known as version control. The goals of product data management include ensuring all stakeholders share a common understanding, that confusion during the execution of the processes is minimized, and that the highest standards of quality controls are maintained. PDM should not be confused with product information management (PIM).

== Introduction ==
Product data management is the use of software or other tools to track and control data related to a particular product. The data tracked usually involves the technical specifications of the product, specifications for manufacture and development, and the types of materials that will be required to produce goods. The use of product data management allows a company to track the various costs associated with the creation and launch of a product. Product data management is part of product lifecycle management and configuration management, and is primarily used by engineers.

Within PDM the focus is on managing and tracking the creation, change, and archive of all information related to a product. The information being stored and managed (on one or more file servers) will include engineering data such as computer-aided design (CAD) models, drawings, and their associated documents.

Product data management (PDM) serves as a central knowledge repository for process and product history and promotes integration and data exchange among all business users who interact with products — including project managers, engineers, salespeople, buyers, and quality assurance teams.

The central database will also manage metadata such as the owner of a file and the release status of the components. The package will control check-in and check-out of the product data to multi-user; carry out engineering change management and release control on all versions/issues of components in a product; build and manipulate the product structure bill of materials (BOM) for assemblies; and assist in configurations management of product variants.

This enables automatic reports on product costs, etc. Furthermore, PDM enables companies producing complex products to spread product data into the entire PLM launch process. This significantly enhances the effectiveness of the launch process.

Product data management is focused on capturing and maintaining information on products and/or services through their development and useful life. Typical information managed within the PDM module includes:
*Brand name
*Part number
*Part description
*Supplier/vendor
*Vendor part number and description
*Unit of measure
*Cost/price
*Schematic or CAD drawing
*Material data-sheets

==Advantages==

* Track and manage all changes to product-related data
* Spend less time organizing and tracking design data
* Improve productivity through reuse of product design data
* Enhance collaboration
* Helps using visual management

== Industrial Applications ==
Product Data Management is closely related and often used interchangeably with Product Information Management (PIM). PDM software applications are commonly used by companies involved in manufacturing and retailing.

== History ==

PDM stems from traditional engineering design activities that created product drawings and schematics on paper and using CAD tools to create parts lists (Bills of Material structures – BOM). The PDM and BOM data are used in enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to plan and coordinate all transactional operations of a company (sales order management, purchasing, cost accounting, logistics, etc.)

PDM is a subset of a larger concept of product lifecycle management (PLM). PLM encompasses the processes needed to launch new products (NPI), manage changes to existing products (ECN/ECO) and retire products at the end of their life span (EoL).

Early Product data management software was developed and used internally at some organizations, such as NASA and Boeing&#x27;s IPAD or Ford Motor Company&#x27;s PDGS. The first Product data management software on the open market was Sherpaworks by Sherpa, released in 1984. More software followed in the 1990s, when the market expanded.

<text>Ernst-Hugo Alfred Järegård (12 December 1928 – 6 September 1998) was a Swedish actor.

== Biography ==
Järegård was born in Ystad. He received his acting training at Malmö City Theatre. From 1962 he was an actor in Sweden&#x27;s prominent Royal Dramatic Theatre, where he came to perform a number of much celebrated parts: his eccentric Hitler in &quot;Schweik in the Second World War&quot; by Bertolt Brecht (1963), Estragon in the legendary 1966 Dramaten-staging of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, Thersites in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; 1967, Orgon in Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot; 1971, Hjalmar Ekdahl in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s 1972 production of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, Nero in Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Britannicus&quot; (1974), a spot-on portrayal of August Strindberg in play &quot;Tribadernas natt&quot; (The Night of the Tribades) by Per Olov Enquist, the title role in &quot;Richard III&quot; by Shakespeare (1980) and the extremely creepy – and slightly perverted – boss Sven in &quot;VD&quot; (&quot;CEO&quot;) by Stig Larsson in 1985, among others.

Järegård had a taste for villainous and dark characters, and enjoyed playing them. But he also had a very lyrical and soft side to him as an actor, something he showed in the TV production of &quot;Hans Christian och sällskapet&quot; (where he plays a village priest who suffers a great personal tragedy as his wife loses her mind after having a baby) and in the TV adaptation of Birger Sjöberg&#x27;s &quot;Frida och hennes vän&quot; (based on Sjöberg&#x27;s &quot;Frida&#x27;s Book&quot;) where he plays the light-hearted, daydreaming early 1900s love-struck suitor of Frida. Adding the fact that Järegård also had a beautiful and expressive singing voice (he performed in a number of stage musicals during his career) gave him an incredible range and versatility as an actor. He originated the role of Guido in the first European staging of the musical &quot;Nine&quot;, for example (Oscarsteatern, Stockholm, 1983). 

His distinct and original voice (with traces of the unmistakable Skåne-dialect) also made him a much appreciated and beloved narrator of children&#x27;s cartoons and audio books. Particularly popular are his audio book (originally radio) recordings of Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, and the narration of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;.

Järegård went on to play the villainous character Elaka Måns (Mean Mike in the English dub) in the Swedish animated movie &quot;Peter-No-Tail&quot; and its sequel &quot;Peter-No-Tail in Americat&quot;. He also lent him voice for the Swedish dub of the film &quot;Valhalla&quot;, playing the Norse God Loki; god of mischief.

Järegård gained international attention when he took on the role of Doctor Helmer in Lars von Trier&#x27;s highly acclaimed mini-series &quot;Riget&quot; and &quot;Riget II&quot; (aka &quot;The Kingdom I &amp; II&quot;). He also appeared in von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Europa&quot;. He participated in about 20 movies and 40 TV productions: aside from the &quot;Riget&quot;-series; some of his greatest roles are in the &quot;Skånska mord&quot;-series, in the 1975 Hasse &amp; Tage comedy &quot;Släpp fångarne loss, det är vår! (Release the Prisoners to Spring)&quot;, in the 1962 cult movie &quot;Raggargänget&quot;, in &quot;Kådisbellan&quot; (aka The Slingshot) in 1993 and as the pompous old drag queen Ragnar Rönn in the teleplay &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; (written and directed by Jonas Gardell), 1997. Also in 1997 he appeared in CHOCK as the series&#x27; host and presented each episode. Usually he would make elaborate philosophical and mystical statements regarding the plot of each episode.

For his acting work, he was awarded with the &quot;Thalia prize&quot; (1967) and the &quot;Eugene O&#x27;Neill Award&quot; (1975), two of Sweden&#x27;s most prestigious theatre awards.

Järegård married (1923–2017) in 1949. They had a son called Johannes. Ernst-Hugo Järegård died of multiple myeloma in Lidingö, aged 69.

== Personality ==
Järegård was a very colourful theatre personality who loved to stand out and celebrated originality. He loved clothes and Italian designers and was picky with designer labels in private – only the best would do. He was of the old belief that as an actor you not only represent yourself as a public person but also the theatre and the art as a whole; as being part of a public institution there for people; and therefore it is an actor&#x27;s responsibility to &quot;scrub up&quot;.

In his director&#x27;s commentary on the DVD release of &quot;Europa&quot;, Lars von Trier commented that Järegård was difficult to work with, frequently sulking and making outrageous demands such as insisting on staying in one specific room in a specific hotel of his choice. He stated that Järegård was a compulsive scene-stealer who could not help attracting the focus even when he was supposed to be in the background of a scene. Von Trier claims that he eventually &#x27;trained&#x27; Järegård by rewarding him with cigars for good behaviour but also called the actor &quot;dear Ernst-Hugo&quot; and said he misses him terribly.

<text>Vasily Semyonovich Grossman (; 12 December (29 November, Julian calendar) 1905 – 14 September 1964) was a Soviet writer and journalist. Born to a Jewish family in Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, Grossman trained as a chemical engineer at Moscow State University, earning the nickname &quot;Vasya-khimik&quot; (&quot;Vasya the Chemist&quot;) because of his diligence as a student. Upon graduation, he took a job in Stalino (now Donetsk) in the Donets Basin. In the 1930s he changed careers and began writing full-time, publishing a number of short stories and several novels.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Grossman was engaged as a war correspondent by the Red Army newspaper &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot;; he wrote first-hand accounts of the battles of Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, and Berlin. Grossman&#x27;s eyewitness reports of a Nazi extermination camp, following the discovery of Treblinka, were among the earliest accounts of a Nazi death camp by a reporter.

There is some dispute over the extent of the state repression Grossman endured after the war. While he was never arrested, his two major literary works (&quot;Life and Fate&quot; and &quot;&quot;) were censored by Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s government as unacceptably anti-Soviet. At the time of Grossman&#x27;s death from stomach cancer in 1964, these books remained unreleased. Hidden copies were eventually smuggled out of the Soviet Union by a network of dissidents, including Andrei Sakharov and Vladimir Voinovich, and first published in the West in 1980, before appearing in the Soviet Union in 1988.
==Early life and career==

Born Iosif Solomonovich Grossman in Berdychiv, Ukraine, Russian Empire, into an emancipated Jewish family, he did not receive a traditional Jewish education. His father Semyon Osipovich Grossman was a chemical engineer, and his mother Yekaterina Savelievna was a teacher of French. A Russian nanny turned his name &quot;Yossya&quot; into Russian &quot;Vasya&quot; (a diminutive of &quot;Vasily&quot;), which was accepted by the whole family. His father had social-democratic convictions and joined the Mensheviks, and was active in the 1905 Revolution; he helped organise events in Sevastopol. From 1910 to 1912, he lived with his mother in Geneva after his parents had separated. After returning to Berdychiv in 1912, he moved to Kiev in 1914 where, while living with his father, he attended secondary school and later the Kiev Higher Institute of Soviet Education. Young Vasily Grossman idealistically supported the hope of the Russian Revolution of 1917.

In January 1928, Grossman married Anna Petrovna Matsuk; their daughter, named Yekaterina after Grossman&#x27;s mother, was born two years later. When he had to move to Moscow, she refused to leave her job in Kiev, but in any case, she could not get a permit to stay in Moscow. When he moved to Stalino, she certainly did not want to go; she had started having affairs. Their daughter was sent to live with his mother in Berdychiv.

Grossman began writing short stories while studying chemical engineering at Moscow State University and later continued his literary activity while working running chemical tests at a coal-mining concern in Stalino in the Donbas, and later in a pencil factory. One of his first short stories, &quot;In the Town of Berdichev&quot; (&quot;В городе Бердичеве&quot;), drew favourable attention and encouragement from Maxim Gorky and Mikhail Bulgakov. The film &quot;Commissar&quot; (director Aleksandr Askoldov), made in 1967, suppressed by the KGB and released only in 1988, is based on this four-page story.

In the mid-1930s Grossman left his job and committed himself fully to writing. By 1936 he had published two collections of stories and the novel &quot;Glyukauf&quot;, and in 1937 was accepted into the privileged Union of Writers. His novel &quot;Stepan Kol&#x27;chugin&quot; (published 1937-40) was nominated for a Stalin prize, but deleted from the list by Stalin himself for alleged Menshevik sympathies.

Grossman&#x27;s first marriage ended in 1933, and in the summer of 1935 he began an affair with Olga Mikhailovna Guber, the wife of his friend, the writer Boris Guber. Grossman and Olga began living together in October 1935, and they married in May 1936, a few days after Olga and Boris Guber divorced. In 1937 during the Great Purge Boris Guber was arrested, and later Olga was also arrested for failing to denounce her previous husband as an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. Grossman quickly had himself registered as the official guardian of Olga&#x27;s two sons by Boris Guber, thus saving them from being sent to orphanages. He then wrote to Nikolay Yezhov, the head of the NKVD, pointing out that Olga was now his wife, not Guber&#x27;s, and that she should not be held responsible for a man from whom she had separated long before his arrest. Grossman&#x27;s friend, Semyon Lipkin, commented, &quot;In 1937 only a very brave man would have dared to write a letter like this to the State&#x27;s chief executioner.&quot; Astonishingly, Olga Guber was released.

==War reporter==

When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Grossman&#x27;s mother was trapped in Berdychiv by the invading German Army, and eventually murdered together with 20,000 to 30,000 other Jews who had not evacuated. Grossman was exempt from military service, but volunteered for the front, where he spent more than 1,000 days. He became a war correspondent for the popular Red Army newspaper &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot; (Red Star). As the war raged on, he covered its major events, including the Battle of Moscow, the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk and the Battle of Berlin. In addition to war journalism, his novels (such as &quot;The People are Immortal&quot; [&quot;Народ бессмертен&quot;]) were published in newspapers and he came to be regarded as a legendary war hero. The novel &quot;Stalingrad&quot; was begun during the war and finished in 1952. After a struggle with censors over the book&#x27;s content, the novel was published in the journal &quot;Znamya&quot;. It was later renamed &quot;For a Just Cause&quot; (&quot;За правое дело&quot;) and heavily edited in republications released after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death. A new English translation, with added material from Grossman&#x27;s politically risky early drafts, was published in 2019 under the original title, &quot;Stalingrad&quot;. In December 2019 the book was the subject of the series &quot;Stalingrad: Destiny of a Novel&quot; in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot;.

Grossman described Nazi ethnic cleansing in German-occupied Ukraine and Poland and the liberation by the Red Army of the German Nazi Treblinka and Majdanek extermination camps. He collected some of the first eyewitness accounts—as early as 1943—of what later became known as the Holocaust. His article &quot;The Hell of Treblinka&quot; (1944) was disseminated at the Nuremberg Trials as evidence for the prosecution.

===&quot;The Hell of Treblinka&quot;===
Grossman interviewed former &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; inmates who escaped from Treblinka and wrote his manuscript without revealing their identities. He had access to materials already published. Grossman described Treblinka&#x27;s operation in the first person. Of Josef Hirtreiter, the &quot;SS&quot; man who served at the reception zone of the Treblinka extermination camp during the arrival of transports, Grossman wrote: 

Grossman&#x27;s description of a physically unlikely method of killing a living human through tearing-by-hand originated from the 1944 memoir of the Treblinka revolt survivor Jankiel Wiernik, where the phrase to &quot;tear the child in half&quot; appeared for the first time. Wiernik himself never worked in the &quot;Auffanglager&quot; receiving area of the camp where Hirtreiter served, and so was repeating hearsay. But the narrative repetition reveals that such stories were retold routinely. Wiernik&#x27;s memoir was published in Warsaw as a clandestine booklet before the war&#x27;s end, and translated in 1945 as &quot;A Year in Treblinka&quot;. In his article, Grossman claimed that 3 million people had been killed at Treblinka, the highest estimate ever proposed, rather than the now widely-accepted 750,000 to 880,000; this was because of an error made by Grossman when he calculated the number of trains that could arrive at the extermination camp each day.

==Conflict with the Soviet government==
Grossman participated in the compiling of the Black Book, a project of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee to document the crimes of the Holocaust. The post-war suppression of the Black Book by the Soviet state shook him to the core, and he began to question his own loyal support of the Soviet government. First the censors ordered changes in the text to conceal the specifically anti-Jewish character of the atrocities and to downplay the role of Ukrainians who worked with the Nazis as police. Then, in 1948, the Soviet edition of the book was scrapped completely. Semyon Lipkin wrote:

Grossman also criticized collectivization and political repression of peasants that led to the Holodomor tragedy. He wrote that &quot;The decree about grain procurement required that the peasants of Ukraine, the Don and the Kuban be put to death by starvation, put to death along with their little children.&quot;

Because of state persecution, only a few of Grossman&#x27;s post-war works were published during his lifetime. After he submitted for publication his magnum opus, the novel &quot;Life and Fate&quot; (Жизнь и судьба, 1959), the KGB raided his flat. The manuscripts, carbon copies, notebooks, as well as the typists&#x27; copies and even the typewriter ribbons were seized. It has been said by many, including Grossman&#x27;s translator, Robert Chandler (see, for example his introduction to Life and Fate that the Politburo ideology chief Mikhail Suslov told Grossman that his book could not be published for two or three hundred years. However, Chandler and Yury Bit-Yunan, in &quot;Vasily Grossman: Myths and Counter-Myths&quot;, say that their research into the notes about that meeting of both Grossman and Suslov show that this was not the case, and in note 2 of that article, Chandler expresses regret for having made the claim.

Grossman wrote to Nikita Khrushchev: &quot;What is the point of me being physically free when the book I dedicated my life to is arrested... I am not renouncing it... I am requesting freedom for my book.&quot; However, &quot;Life and Fate&quot; and his last major novel, &quot;Everything Flows&quot; (Все течет, 1961) were considered a threat to the Soviet power and remained unpublished. Grossman died in 1964, not knowing whether his greatest work would ever be read by the public.

==Death==
Grossman died of stomach cancer on 14 September 1964. He was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery on the edge of Moscow.

==Legacy==
&quot;Life and Fate&quot; was first published in Russian in 1980 in Switzerland, thanks to fellow dissidents: the physicist Andrei Sakharov secretly photographed draft pages preserved by Semyon Lipkin, and the writer Vladimir Voinovich smuggled the photographic films abroad. Two dissident researchers, professors and writers Efim Etkind and Shimon Markish, retyped the text from the microfilm, with some mistakes and misreadings due to the bad quality. The book was finally published in the Soviet Union in 1988 after the policy of glasnost was initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev. The text was published again in 1989 after further original manuscripts emerged after the first publication. &quot;Everything Flows&quot; was also published in the Soviet Union in 1989, and was republished in English with a new translation by Robert Chandler in 2009. &quot;Life and Fate&quot; was first published in English in 1985; a revised English translation by Robert Chandler was published in 2006 and widely praised, being described as &quot;World War II&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

&quot;Life and Fate&quot; is considered to be in part an autobiographical work. Robert Chandler wrote in his introduction to the Harvill edition that its leading character, Viktor Shtrum, &quot;is a portrait of the author himself,&quot; reflecting in particular his anguish at the murder of his mother at the Berdichev Ghetto. Chapter 18, a letter from Shtrum&#x27;s mother, Anna, has been dramatized for the stage and film as &quot;The Last Letter&quot; (2002), directed by Frederick Wiseman and starring Catherine Samie. Chandler suggests that aspects of the character and experience of Shtrum are based on the physicist Lev Landau. The late novel &quot;Everything Flows&quot;, in turn, is especially noted for its quiet, unforced, and yet horrifying condemnation of the Soviet totalitarian state: a work in which Grossman, liberated from worries about censors, spoke honestly about Soviet history.

Some critics have compared Grossman&#x27;s novels to the work of Leo Tolstoy.

<doc id="638153" wikidata="Q1424895" url="?curid=638153" title="Clonus">
<text>Clonus is a set of involuntary and rhythmic muscular contractions and relaxations. Clonus is a sign of certain neurological conditions, particularly associated with upper motor neuron lesions involving descending motor pathways, and in many cases is accompanied by spasticity (another form of hyperexcitability). Unlike small spontaneous twitches known as fasciculations (usually caused by lower motor neuron pathology), clonus causes large motions that are usually initiated by a reflex. Studies have shown clonus beat frequency to range from three to eight Hz on average, and may last a few seconds to several minutes depending on the patient&#x27;s condition.

==Signs==
Clonus is most commonly found at the ankle, specifically with a dorsiflexion/plantarflexion movement (up and down). Some case studies have also reported clonus in the finger, toe, and laterally in the ankle (as opposed to the typical up and down motion).

* Ankle (medial gastrocnemius) 
* Patella (knee cap)
* Triceps surae 
* Biceps brachii

==Cause==
Clonus is typically seen in people with cerebral palsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord damage and hepatic encephalopathy. It can occur in epilepsy as part of a generalized tonic–clonic seizure, and in pregnant women presenting with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. It can also be an adverse drug reaction, such as after ingestion of potent serotonergic drugs, where clonus strongly predicts imminent serotonin toxicity (serotonin syndrome).

== Mechanism ==

===Hyperactive stretch reflexes===
The self re-excitation of hyperactive stretch reflexes theory involves a repetitive contract-relax cycle in the affected muscle, which creates oscillatory movements in the affected limb. In order for self re-excitation to exist, both an increase in motor neuron excitability and nerve signal delay are required. Increased motor neuron excitability is likely accomplished by alterations to the net inhibition of neurons occurring as a result of injury to the central nervous system (CNS) (stroke/ spinal cord injury). This lack of inhibition biases neurons to a net excitatory state, therefore increasing total signal conduction. Signaling delay is present due to an increased nerve conduction time. Long delays are primarily due to long reflex pathways, which are common in distal joints and muscles. This may therefore explain why clonus is typically found in distal structures like the ankle. Frequency of clonus beats have been found to be directly proportional to the length of the reflex pathway it is found in.

===Central oscillator===
Clonus, with respect to the presence of a central oscillator, functions on the theory that when the central oscillator is turned on by a peripheral event, it will continue to rhythmically excite motor neurons, therefore creating clonus.

Although the two proposed mechanisms are very different in [theory] and are still debated, some studies now propose the potential of both mechanisms co-existing to create clonus. It is thought that the stretch reflex pathway may be stimulated first, and through its events, cause a decreased synaptic current threshold. This decreased synaptic current threshold would enhance motor neuron excitability as nerve impulses would be more readily conducted, and thus turn on this central oscillator. This theory is still being investigated.

===Clonus and spasticity===
Clonus tends to co-exist with spasticity in many cases of stroke and spinal cord injury likely due to their common physiological origins. Some consider clonus as simply an extended outcome of spasticity. Although closely linked, clonus is not seen in all patients with spasticity. Clonus tends to not be present with spasticity in patients with significantly increased muscle tone, as the muscles are constantly active and therefore not engaging in the characteristic on/off cycle of clonus.

Clonus results due to an increased motor neuron excitation (decreased action potential threshold) and is common in muscles with long conduction delays, such as the long reflex tracts found in distal muscle groups. Clonus is commonly seen in the ankle but may exist in other distal structures as well.

== Diagnosis ==
Clonus at the ankle is tested by rapidly flexing the foot into dorsiflexion (upward), inducing a stretch to the gastrocnemius muscle. Subsequent beating of the foot will result, however only a sustained clonus (5 beats or more) is considered abnormal. Clonus can also be tested in the knees by rapidly pushing the patella (knee cap), towards the toes.

== Voluntary Induction in Healthy People ==

Gregory Bateson described the induction of clonus in healthy people:

In the text, Bateson goes on to describe induction of clonus as a key element of Balinese ritual.

Naval mine clearance was originally done by whatever type of vessel could easily be adapted to the task, paddle steamers proving particularly suited due to their shallow draught. In both World Wars naval trawlers were used, as they were naturally suitable for wire sweeping. In World War II this task was given to smaller trawlers of about 300 tons, larger ones being used for anti-submarine work. The increased sophistication and threat posed by the mine meant that specialist mine countermeasure vessels eventually had to be built: the Minesweeping Sloop. This term was officially dropped in 1937, but remained in use nonetheless. The Royal Navy has possessed such vessels since 1914.

There were also some conversions of ships originally built for other purposes for special minesweeping. This was mainly early in World War II for sweeping acoustic and magnetic mines, and later in the war for sweeping influence mines. The ships selected were of varying origin and age and thus do not form a class as such.

* sloop (112 ships in 4 sub-classes, launched 1914–1918) convoy sloops intended originally for minesweeping
* Hunt class, &quot;Belvoir&quot; group (20 ships, launched 1916–17) Ailsa twin-screw coastal minesweeping sloops
* Hunt class, &quot;Aberdare&quot; group (87 ships, launched 1917–1919) Admiralty twin-screw coastal minesweeping sloops

* (10 ships, launched 1952–1955) inshore minehunters
* &quot;Wilton&quot;-class minesweeper/minehunter (1 ship, launched 18 January 1972) open-water minesweeper and minehunter. Prototype ship built of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) to same hull design as &quot;Ton&quot; class. Forerunner of the Hunt and &quot;Sandown&quot; classes, also built of GRP. 
* (13 ships, launched 1978–1988) mine countermeasures vessels
* (2 ships, bought 1979) deep-water single-role minesweepers
* (12 ships, launched 1982–1985) deep-water single-role minesweepers

<doc id="638166" wikidata="Q798676" url="?curid=638166" title="Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja">
<text>also known simply as either Bad Dudes (on the American NES port) or (in Japan and Europe), is a side-scrolling cooperative beat &#x27;em up developed and released by Data East as an arcade video game in 1988. It was ported to computer and game console home systems.

In &quot;Bad Dudes&quot;, the players are tasked with rescuing &quot;President Ronnie&quot; from ninja kidnappers. The game was a commercial success, becoming one of America&#x27;s top five highest-grossing games in 1988. The arcade version received generally positive reviews from critics, while the home conversions received also a positive critical reception. It has since become widely known for its general premise and introductory cutscene.

==Plot==
The game is set in Washington, D.C., United States, where President Ronnie (based on 40th President Ronald Reagan) has been abducted by the evil Dragon Ninja. The game begins with the following introduction: &quot;Rampant ninja related crimes these days ... Whitehouse is not the exception&quot;. A Secret Service agent speaks to the titular &quot;Bad Dudes&quot;, a tough and heroic duo of street-smart brawlers named Blade and Striker: &quot;President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?&quot;

===Chapters===
The Bad Dudes pursue the Dragon Ninja through the New York City streets, onto a moving big rig truck, through a large storm sewer, through a forest, onto a freight train on an old Southern Pacific line (where the titular character of another Data East arcade game, &quot;Chelnov&quot;, can be seen being transported in a frozen container in the arcade version), through a cave, and into an underground factory in order to save President Ronnie.

===Epilogue (US version)===
After the Bad Dudes defeat the Dragon Ninja, they celebrate by eating hamburgers with President Ronnie. At the very end, President Ronnie is seen holding a burger while standing between the Bad Dudes. Behind them are many security guards, with the White House in the background.

===Epilogue (Japan version)===
President Ronnie gives the Bad Dudes a statue of them, as a reward for rescuing and protecting both Washington, D.C., and its leader. The Bad Dudes are seen leaning against a fence on a sidewalk next to their statue.

==Gameplay==
Two players can play at once. Player one controls the character Blade, who wears white pants, and player two controls the character Striker, who wears green pants. Players start with the ability to do basic punches, kicks, and jumps. Some moves are special like spinning kicks and the ability to charge themselves up with &quot;inner energy&quot; by holding the punch button to throw a powerful long-range attack that hits all opponents in front of the player. Players will also come across several power-ups; some are weapons like knives and nunchakus, some recharge a player&#x27;s health, and others add a few seconds to the remaining time.

The various types of enemies encountered in the game have their own means of attack. The basic blue-colored ninjas directly charge the player, while some leap with their swords, or throw shuriken and makibishi; there are also acrobatic kunoichi (female ninjas), attack dogs, and people who are on fire. The enemies may be beaten down or avoided. Most enemies can be beaten with only a single hit of any kind, and multiple enemies can be defeated with one hit if they are standing close together.

At the end of each level, one of the super warrior bosses will appear, who needs to be defeated to progress to the next level. The first of them, at the climax of the City stage, is Karnov, who makes a cameo appearance from the Data East game of the same name. Second, at the climax of the Truck stage, is a talon-wielding ninja, Iron Arm. Third, at the climax of the Sewer stage, is Kamui, another ninja master, who creates illusions by copying himself. Fourth, at the climax of the Forest stage, is Animal, a behemoth-of-a-man who is also not a ninja. Fifth, at the climax of the Train stage, is Akaikage, a kusarigama-wielding warrior. Last, at the climax of the Cave stage, is Devil Pole, a bōjutsu-master. Finally, the leader of the Dragon Ninja gang, coincidentally also called Dragon Ninja, appears during the climax in his headquarters, where there is a final showdown on a helicopter. The background music during the fight with him is similar to the main theme in &quot;Karnov&quot;.

Each boss has his own special attack: Karnov, for example, can breathe fire at the player. Upon the successful completion of each level and after defeating the boss, the dude(s) will strike a &quot;bad&quot; pose and proclaim, &quot;I&#x27;m bad!&quot;. The shout, and the game&#x27;s American wordmark logo are both similar to the Michael Jackson song &quot;Bad&quot;, released the previous year. In the Japanese version of the game, this quote was originally a battle cry.

==History==
The game was ported to home systems, including the Apple II, Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MSX, MS-DOS in 1988. Quicksilver Software developed the Apple II and PC ports with the rest produced by UK-based Ocean Software and published in Europe on their Imagine label as &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot;. These versions were titled &quot;Dragon Ninja&quot; in-game, and the &quot;Bad Dudes Vs.&quot; was de-emphasised in the cover art, resulting in the game commonly being known by the latter title (including among the European gaming press of the time).

A NES/Famicom port was developed by Data East and published in Japan by Namco as &quot;DragonNinja&quot; on July 14, 1989. In North America, the same version was released that year by Data East USA simply as &quot;Bad Dudes&quot;, featuring an illustration by Marc Ericksen.

After Data East became defunct due to their bankruptcy in 2003, G-Mode bought the intellectual rights to the arcade game, as well as most other Data East games, and licensed them globally. The arcade version is also featured, along with several other Data East arcade games, on the Wii title &quot;Data East Arcade Classics&quot;, produced by Majesco Entertainment with permission from G-Mode. In 2018, the Nintendo Switch version was released in the &quot;Johnny Turbo&#x27;s Arcade&quot; series, featuring a live-action intro. It uses a fanart mockup screenshot, but actually has the original arcade graphics.

The 8-bit versions and the PC version lack the two-player cooperative mode in any form, instead having an alternating two-player mode. The title screen of the Japanese version became different, while the English version is unchanged. The Secret Service agent&#x27;s quote on the intro screen of the NES version is phrased slightly differently as &quot;The President has been kidnapped by ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the President?&quot;, while the Famicom counterpart&#x27;s quote is slightly similar to the international arcade and NES quotes. The reference to President Ronnie (an overt reference to former president of the United States Ronald Reagan) was removed because Nintendo of America did not allow political content in games. In that version, the President bears a resemblance to George H. W. Bush, who was the president of the United States when the NES version was released. The endings of the Japanese and English language versions of the NES port are based on the international arcade version, but the Japanese version does not show the credits and only shows &quot;The End&quot; at the White House scene and lasts a shorter time than the English version. The 8-bit home computer versions lack the intro from either the arcade or the NES versions. The &quot;I&#x27;m bad!&quot; speech is only present in the NES version.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
The game was commercially successful in arcades. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;DragonNinja&quot; on their May 15, 1988, issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month. In North America, it was a high-earning arcade game, becoming one of the top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1988. On the UK &quot;Coinslot&quot; charts, during Summer 1988, &quot;Bad Dudes&quot; was number two on the monthly arcade video game chart. On Hong Kong&#x27;s annual Bondeal chart, it was the seventh highest-grossing arcade game of 1988.

The arcade game received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; magazine, in its January 1989 issue, gave it the award for best Beat &#x27;Em Up of 1988.

===Home===
In the ZX Spectrum sales charts, it was number two, behind &quot;Robocop&quot;.

The home conversions received a generally positive to mixed critical reception. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; noted the IBM port was satisfactory and compared it favorably to similar ports of &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Renegade&quot;, but the Apple II port suffered greatly.

President Ronnie, as he appears in the arcade version of the game, was ranked second in &quot;EGM&quot;&#x27;s list of the top ten video game politicians in 2008. In 2010, UGO wrote: &quot;No ninja game retrospective could possibly be complete without some mention of ... &quot;Bad Dudes&quot;&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Complex&quot; had it top their list of &quot;the video games where you kick ass in the name of America&quot; as the most American game of them all.

==Legacy==
The game was followed by a spiritual successor in 1991: &quot;Two Crude&quot; (known in Japan as &quot;Crude Buster&quot;). A sequel which was supposed to take place 23 years after the first game was unsuccessfully attempted to be financed via Kickstarter by Pinstripe Games in 2012.

The arcade version of the game appears in the 1989 film &quot;Parenthood&quot;, where the son of Steve Martin&#x27;s character wonders why the game is so difficult. Martin, grasping for an answer, says, &quot;Well, they&#x27;re bad dudes. That&#x27;s why they call the game &quot;Bad Dudes&quot;&quot;. The &quot;Bad Dudes&quot; logo can be seen at the end of Stage 4 in &quot;Sly Spy&quot;, another Data East arcade game. In the 1990 film &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;, Officer Duffy gets pushed by RoboCop into a &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot; arcade cabinet, but with &quot;Sly Spy&quot; built into it.

The game&#x27;s introduction, challenging the player to be a &quot;bad enough dude to rescue the President&quot;, became a popular Internet meme and is often lampooned on various websites. The 2008 video game &quot;Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space&quot; spoofs on the &quot;Bad Dudes&quot; intro in the episode &quot;Chariots of the Dogs&quot;. Alternative rock band Lostprophets&#x27; first release, &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;, includes a track titled &quot;Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja&quot; in a reference to the video games &quot;Shinobi&quot; and &quot;Bad Dudes vs. DragonNinja&quot;. The webcomic &quot;The Adventures of Dr. McNinja&quot; often references the Bad Dudes, among many other 1980s pop culture touchstones.

In 2018, an updated version of the game was announced for the Intellivision Amico.

In 2023, filmmaker BenDavid Grabinski discussed how he tried to make a film adaptation of the video game.

===Rereleases===
Reissues of the game were nonexistent in the two decades that followed its original release. In recent years, however, rereleases of the original arcade version &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot; and its NES port &quot;Bad Dudes&quot; have become increasingly common:
*&quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot; is one of the 15 arcade games included in Data East Arcade Classics released in February 2010 for the Wii.
*The arcade version is on the Zeebo Brazilian home console released in 2010. 
*The NES version is included in the compilation &quot;Retro-Bit Data East All Star Collection&quot;, a multi-cart of five Data East games released in 2017 for the Nintendo Entertainment System itself. Another compilation from the same manufacturer called &quot;8 Bit Collection Data East Vol.01&quot;, with a similar assortment of titles, was released the following year in Japan for the Retro Duo famiclone and includes the American NES port of &quot;Bad Dudes&quot; unlike the rest of the Data East games of that regional collection which are all in their Famicom versions. 
*The game is part of the dedicated console &quot;Super Retro-Cade&quot; released in late 2017 and is one of the few titles in the compilation to have both its arcade and NES versions included.
*The arcade version was released in 2018 for the Nintendo Switch as part of Flying Tiger&#x27;s Johnny Turbo series.
*Since 2018, the retro gaming company My Arcade has released the NES version on different occasions either as a standalone mini-arcade cabinet or as part of a collection of eight Data East games, both as a mini-cabinet and handheld console. The same company also released the arcade version &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot; in a compilation that included more than 30 Data East games in the form of a mini-arcade cabinet.
*In early 2020, &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot; along with three other Data East classics were released in an actual arcade cabinet at the cost of $399 by manufacturer Arcade1Up.
*The arcade version and the NES port are each included in their respective collections for the Evercade handheld console.

<doc id="638169" wikidata="Q51411" url="?curid=638169" title="Homomonument">
<text>The Homomonument is a memorial in the centre of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. It commemorates all gay men and lesbians who have been persecuted because of their sexual orientation. Opened on 5 September 1987, it was the first monument in the world to commemorate gays and lesbians who were killed by the German Nazi regime.

The monument takes the form of three large pink triangles made of granite, set into the ground, which together compose a larger triangle. It is located on the bank of the Keizersgracht canal, near the historic Westerkerk church. The Homomonument was designed to &quot;inspire and support lesbians and gays in their struggle against denial, oppression and discrimination.&quot;

During the Netherlands&#x27; annual Remembrance Day ceremony on 4 May, wreaths are laid on the monument to commemorate LGBT victims of persecution. A day later, on Liberation Day, the monument becomes the site of a street party.

== Symbolism ==
The Homomonument is an abstract composition of three pink triangles made of granite. The symbol has historical roots; the pink triangle was a cloth badge used in Nazi concentration camps to identify men who had been jailed for homosexuality, which also included bisexual men and transgender women. It is estimated that 100,000 men were arrested and half of these spent time imprisoned during Nazi rule. Subsequently, the pink triangle became a symbol of the emancipation of the LGBT community and its struggle for its rights.

However, the Homomonument not only commemorates the victims of World War II, but all homosexual men and women who have been persecuted and murdered. The monument also honours those who have fought for the freedom and human rights of LGBTQ members. The designer of the monument, artist Karin Daan, described the symbolism of the monument as follows:
== History ==

The idea of perpetuating the memory of homosexual victims of World War II appeared at the very beginning of the organized Dutch gay movement. In 1961, activist Jef Last suggested a &#x27;monument to the unknown gay&#x27;: &quot;No one knows how many there were, no statistics indicate how many of them were beaten to death in those camps or starved or otherwise succumbed. No flame burns for unknown homophiles&quot;. However, this idea was not further developed until the 1970s, when the visibility and openness of the marginalized and stigmatized gay community became important political goals for many gay rights organizations.

In 1970, a year before the complete decriminalization of homosexuality in the Netherlands, a group of gay activists were arrested for trying to lay a wreath at the National Monument to the Victims of World War II on Dam Square, Amsterdam. The flowers were removed from the memorial by the police and declared insulting to the memory of the dead. This incident angered the LGBT community and catalyzed the struggle for the recognition of victims of repression. Throughout the 1970s, similar wreath-placing demonstrations were executed with varying success, as activists pushed for the inclusion of homosexuals in the public&#x27;s collective memory of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;social purification&quot; campaigns.

In the spring of 1979, during a period of rapid growth of the gay rights movement, the initiative to build a monument to persecuted homosexuals entered a qualitatively new stage when the Homomonument Foundation was founded. Its main goal was the implementation of the memorial project. One of the founders of the fund was Pacifist Socialist Party member Bob van Schijndel. Pointing to the fact that a monument to the Romani victims of the Nazi genocide was opened in Amsterdam in 1978, van Schijndel proposed a similar memorial which would be dedicated to the homosexuals who suffered during the Nazi rule. The founders of the fund also included representatives of the Labour Party, the People&#x27;s Party and the Christian Democratic Party of the Netherlands.

In 1980, artists were invited to submit designs and a jury was assembled consisting of experts in the fields of art and design. The following year, out of 137 designs submitted to the competition, the jury chose the design by Karin Daan. With the triangle on the water as its central point, Daan expanded the design to make her work as monumental as possible without disrupting its surroundings. The government of Amsterdam allocated a place for the erection of the monument, but construction did not begin for another seven years. Many organizations and individuals made donations for the monument, with individual contributions from the Dutch Parliament, the government of Ruud Lubbers, the city of Amsterdam and the province of North Holland.

The idea of creating a monument was pointedly criticized by a number of political and public figures, who either did not recognize the fact of repression, considering the persecution of homosexuals to be legal, or argued that the creation of a monument to a separate small group was unjustifiable. Former Foreign Minister of the Netherlands Joseph Luns compared homosexuals to kleptomaniacs. In opposition to him, supporters of the monument noted that its construction would not make sense if there were no people in society who caused suffering to gays and lesbians, complicating their lives. The Daan design also drew criticism from some gay activists, who wanted the monument to have a more imposing design.

The first stone was laid on 28 April 1987, at Westermarkt. The opening ceremony of the Homomonument took place on 5 September 1987. It became the first gay monument of its kind in the world. Because of this, the Netherlands became known as the most tolerant Western nation, since the act of erecting a monument meant the recognition of the injustice of the past.

== Construction ==

The Homomonument was erected on the Westermarkt square on the banks of the Keizersgracht canal, near the historic Westerkerk church. The memorial is a composition of three equilateral triangles of pink granite with edge lengths of 10 meters, which are interconnected by thin lines of similar material, thus forming one large equilateral triangle with a side length of 36 meters. Karin Daan designed the monument to be as imposing as possible without disturbing the environment, fitting it as closely as possible into the historic urban landscape.

The Homomonument embodies three ideas and three times: the memory of the past, opposition to discrimination and repression in the present, and parting words for the future. The first triangle is located on the embankment of the Keizersgracht canal. Four gradually tapering steps broken in the centre lead down from the pavement to a platform resting on the water. The top of the triangle, projecting into the canal, points to Dam Square, where the National Monument to the Victims of World War II is located. Four pontoons protect the monument from possible damage by passing ships. This triangle symbolizes the present time. Here people can often be seen sitting on the steps, and on the platform resting near the water, flowers are regularly laid and candles are lit.

The second triangle is made in the form of a podium, rising 60 centimetres above the surface of the square. It symbolizes the future. The outward-facing peak points to the headquarters of the LGBT organization &quot;COC&quot; at Rosenstraat 14. The abbreviation &quot;COC&quot; originally stood for &quot;Cultuur en Ontspannings-Centrum&quot; (with nid. – &quot;Centre for culture and recreation&quot;) and was conceived as a neutral-sounding front for an LGBT organization. Founded in 1946, it is the oldest LGBT organization in the world. Near the triangle, there is an information kiosk called &quot;Pink Point&quot;, which sells literature and souvenirs related to the gay life of the Netherlands. The podium itself is often used as a stage for various events.

The third triangle is located flush with the paving stones of the square. It symbolizes the past. Around the perimeter of the slab is engraved a line from the poem &quot;To the Young Fisherman&quot; by the Dutch Jewish poet Jacob Israël de Haan, who was allegedly homosexual: &quot;Such a boundless craving for friendship&quot; (), which, according to the plan of Karin Daan, describes the driving force in relationships between people. The apex, outside the large triangle, points to the home of Anne Frank, a Jewish girl whose diaries written during the German occupation of the Netherlands combined millions of human tragedies associated with the Nazi genocide in the story of one child.

The three historical sites which the monument points to were chosen to further emphasize the context in which the memorial itself and its symbols exist. The plate, placed on the canal fence on both sides (so that it can be seen both from land and from the water), contains an inscription in three languages (Dutch, English and French):
In 1991, the bridge over the Keizersgracht canal, located north of the Homomonument, was renamed in honour of the anti-fascist, resistance fighter, gay activist, and long-term leader of the COC Niek Engelschman.

== Current situation ==

Every year, on the National Day of Remembrance on 4 May, the Homomonument hosts an official ceremony to commemorate the gays and lesbians who were victims of Nazi repression, as well as those who are still being persecuted for their sexual orientation around the world. The event, which brings together hundreds of people, is attended by various officials, representatives of political parties, and public organizations, many of whom make speeches. The ceremony begins at 8 pm and includes the laying of flowers, the lowering of the Dutch flag, and the traditional two minutes of silence followed by the national anthem &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;. Previously, the use of official paraphernalia was prohibited, but this position was later changed.

On the King&#x27;s Day on 27 April and Liberation Day on 5 May, colourful Pink Triangle festivals are held at Westermarkt, which include dances, concerts, performances by artists, drag queens, and so on. These festivities, according to the organizers, should testify to the connection between the past and the present and be a guarantee that history will not be forgotten and will not lose its relevance.

The Homomonument, as the first monument of its kind, has gained worldwide fame and is a popular tourist attraction in Amsterdam. People from all over the world come to it to lay flowers and take pictures.

The Homomonument underwent restoration in 2003. On 24 October 2006, the mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, and the chairman of the LGBT organization COC, Frank van Dalen, inaugurated a model Homomonument in the Madurodam miniature park in The Hague. Another monument in memory of LGBT victims of repression and persecution was dedicated in Barcelona, Spain in 2011, which was modeled after the Homomonument.

Today, the Westermarkt has become one of the centres of life for the Dutch LGBT community. Various events are often held here, including rallies, photo exhibitions, flash mobs, open lectures, weddings, celebrations, and other events. The Homomonument Foundation coordinates and funds these events.

<text>Whoopee! was a British comic book magazine that ran from (issues dates) 9 March 1974 to 30 March 1985, when it merged with &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;. It was published by IPC Magazines Ltd and ran for 572 issues.

The first issue of &quot;Whoopee!&quot; ran to forty pages, with a free gift in the form of a &#x27;squirter ring&#x27;. The strapline exhorted potential readers to &quot;Get happy — get this paper!&quot;.

&quot;Shiver and Shake&quot; merged with &quot;Whoopee!&quot; shortly after its launch in 1974, followed by &quot;Cheeky&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Wow!&quot; in 1983. 14 “Whoopee” annuals were published, the last one dated 1992. A &quot;Best of Whoopee!&quot; monthly reprints comic was published for a few years in the early 1990s.

<doc id="638186" wikidata="Q17089994" url="?curid=638186" title="Fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces">
<text>In mathematics, a number of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces generalise the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. They have applications, for example, to the proof of existence theorems for partial differential equations. 

The first result in the field was the [[Schauder fixed-point theorem]], proved in 1930 by Juliusz Schauder (a previous result in a different vein, the Banach fixed-point theorem for contraction mappings in complete metric spaces was proved in 1922). Quite a number of further results followed. One way in which fixed-point theorems of this kind have had a larger influence on mathematics as a whole has been that one approach is to try to carry over methods of algebraic topology, first proved for finite simplicial complexes, to spaces of infinite dimension. For example, the research of Jean Leray who founded sheaf theory came out of efforts to extend Schauder&#x27;s work.

[[Schauder fixed-point theorem]]: Let &quot;C&quot; be a nonempty closed convex subset of a Banach space &quot;V&quot;. If &quot;f&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot; is continuous with a compact image, then &quot;f&quot; has a fixed point.

Tikhonov (Tychonoff) fixed-point theorem: Let &quot;V&quot; be a locally convex topological vector space. For any nonempty compact convex set &quot;X&quot; in &quot;V&quot;, any continuous function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; has a fixed point.

Browder fixed-point theorem: Let &quot;K&quot; be a nonempty closed bounded convex set in a uniformly convex Banach space. Then any non-expansive function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;K&quot; → &quot;K&quot; has a fixed point. (A function formula_1 is called non-expansive if formula_2 for each formula_3 and formula_4.)

Other results include the Markov–Kakutani fixed-point theorem (1936-1938) and the Ryll-Nardzewski fixed-point theorem (1967) for continuous affine self-mappings of compact convex sets, as well as the Earle–Hamilton fixed-point theorem (1968) for holomorphic self-mappings of open domains.

[[Kakutani fixed-point theorem]]: Every correspondence that maps a compact convex subset of a locally convex space into itself with a closed graph and convex nonempty images has a fixed point.
