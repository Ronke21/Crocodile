<text>NBN is an Australian television station based in Newcastle, Australia. The station was inaugurated on 4 March 1962 as the first regional commercial television station in New South Wales, and has since expanded to 39 transmitters throughout Northern New South Wales, including the Gold Coast, Queensland, Lismore, Tweed Heads, Tamworth, Coffs Harbour, Newcastle, and Central Coast. It is owned and operated by the Nine Network, with regional sales and newsroom located at 28 Honeysuckle Drive.

The station&#x27;s call sign, NBN, is an acronym for Newcastle Broadcasting New South Wales. NBN is the only regional station in mainland Australia to produce a one-hour news bulletin seven days a week. Since 2007, it has been owned by Nine&#x27;s parent company Nine Entertainment making it a sister station to its metropolitan counterparts. However, following the PBL acquisition, NBN at the time continued to operate as an independent regional affiliate of the main network under the name &quot;NBN Television&quot;. On 1 July 2016, when Nine switched regional affiliations outside Northern NSW and the Gold Coast, NBN was finally folded into the Nine Network adopting the primary logo with the NBN name retired on air.

==History==
===Origins===

NBN&#x27;s original owner, the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation (NBTC) was founded in May 1958 to begin preparations for the upcoming television licence allocations. The main shareholders in NBTC were United Broadcasting Company (owned by the Lamb family, owners of radio station 2KO), Airsales Broadcasting Company (owners of local radio station 2HD), and the &quot;Newcastle Morning Herald &amp; Miners Advocate&quot; (to be bought out by John Fairfax &amp; Sons). In accordance with the Australian Broadcasting Control Board regulations, at least 50% of the company had to be locally owned. Approximately 2,000 people bought shares.

The Australian Broadcasting Control Board awarded the commercial television licence for the Newcastle and Hunter Valley area to the NBTC on 1 August 1961. NBN-3 would transmit on VHF channel 3, from a transmitter atop Mount Sugarloaf near Newcastle. Council approval for the transmitter was issued on 17 July that year.

The call-letters, NBN, were derived from the company&#x27;s name, Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation, with the second N representing New South Wales, as required by law. Unofficially, it stood for &quot;Newcastle Broadcasting Network&quot;.

Construction began in November 1961, supervised by engineers from RCA in the United States. It was a step backwards for RCA, building a new station transmitting in black and white while colour television was fast becoming the norm in the United States. Ninety per cent of the original equipment was imported from the United States, and held in bond until they were due to be installed. Equipment was purchased with colour production and transmission in mind, so that only 20% modification would be required when colour came to NBN. Studios were to be built on a block at Mosbri Crescent, near the city centre.

Work on the transmitter was delayed by a combination of weather, the conditions for the road leading to Mount Sugarloaf, and excited sightseers blocking work trucks during the weekends. During that time, the technical team stayed at the top of the mountain. The construction took eight months at a cost of $1.5 million, and required staff to work seven days a week (except on Christmas Day) to make the deadline.

Test transmissions took place in early 1962, and could be seen as far away as Muswellbrook, Avalon, Katoomba, Lithgow, Gloucester and around Port Kembla.

====Opening night====

NBN Television commenced transmission on 4 March 1962. The first programme on launch night began at 6 pm, a taped welcome by the then-Postmaster General Charles Davidson. Following that was a guided tour around the NBN studios by the original production manager, Matthew Tapp.

Murray Finlay began one of the longest newsreading careers in Australia with NBN&#x27;s first news bulletin at 6:30 pm. This was followed by &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; at 7 pm, and the 1937 movie &quot;Green Light&quot; starring Errol Flynn at 7:30; the &quot;George Sanders Mystery Theater&quot; series followed at 9 pm, with opening episode, &quot;The Man in the Elevator&quot;, followed by the first episode from the &quot;Halls of Ivy&quot;, then the first &quot;Mystery Theatre&quot; program, &quot;The Missing Head&quot; at 10 pm. Anglican Bishop James Housden gave the first evening meditation at 10:30 pm, marking the end of the first night of transmission for NBN-3 in Newcastle. Commercials on the first night included Rothmans, Streets Ice Cream, Ampol, Commonwealth Bank, Shell, and WD &amp; HO Wills, amongst others.

In the lead-up to the opening night, the station promised at least two movies a week, as well as men&#x27;s interest programs each Saturday afternoon between 3 pm and 4 pm – a commitment successfully met, along with female-targeted programming in the early afternoon, and children&#x27;s programming from 4:30 to 6:30 pm weekdays and mature programming thirty minutes before closedown each night. NBN Television broadcast fifty-six hours in its first week of transmission, setting the Australian television record for the most time spent on air in a week for a new television station.

===1960s to the 1970s===
Soon after launch night, NBN extended television coverage from Bungwahl to Broken Bay and as far west as Aberdeen. The station only operated eight hours per day, however several programs were produced locally including &quot;Home at Three&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Cook With Gas&quot;, &quot;Tempo&quot;, &quot;Focus&quot;, as well as nightly news bulletins at 6:30 pm.

In 1963, Australian Consolidated Press and News Limited bought 200,000 shares in the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation. Shortly after, United Broadcasting Company sold its shares to Neatherley Investments Limited in Adelaide, and Australian United Investments in Melbourne, with each company purchasing 100,000 shares. Time Enterprises, purchased Australian United Investments’ shares in November 1967.

During the period between 1968 and 1969, NBN secured a relay from the Postmaster-General to enhance their news service. In 1970, NBN began upgrading its studios in preparation for the commencement of colour television originally scheduled for 1972, later changed to March 1975, at a cost of $360,000. The improvements included an enlarged film department; a film editing and cleaning equipment; a larger master control with four video transfer machines; a new telecine room with caption scanner and slide drums; as well as an expansion of the administration and staff offices, which also included new offices and a boardroom.

In 1972, NBN was granted a licence to operate a translator in the Upper Hunter Valley from Rossgole Lookout near Aberdeen, on VHF channel 10. Concurrently in April 1972, NBN expanded its nightly news service to one hour, becoming the first television station in Australia to have a one-hour news bulletin. As a part of earlier preparations for colour production, between 1972 and 1973, orders were placed with Rank Cintel and the EMI Group in the United Kingdom and Ampex in the United States for new colour equipment, in time for colour transmission tests on 7 October 1974. On 1 March 1975, the station began regular colour transmissions, whilst transmission was expanded to Banderra Downs, Merriwa, Mount Helen, and Murrurundi at a cost of $180,000. In 1978, the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation made a bid for local station (and former owner) 2HD, however was disallowed by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Also during the same year more extensions were added to the studios (which included a new car park), which were officially opened on 17 November 1978.

On 22 November 1979, the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation officially became NBN Limited, after the station itself rebranded from &quot;Channel 3&quot; to &quot;NBN Television&quot; around 1977. By the late 1970s, NBN was producing 20 hours a week of local and networked programming from its studios, which in turn led the station to purchase a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter for news coverage purposes.

===1980s to the 1990s===
In early 1980, NBN purchased Southern Television Corporation Limited, owners of NWS-9 in Adelaide, for $19 million. During the same year, NBN began a teletext service and also purchased the free local newspaper, the &quot;Newcastle Star&quot;. In June 1981 Parry Corporation purchased 19.88% shareholding.

Parry had then attempted to buy Michael Wansey&#x27;s stake in NBN, but was blocked by the Supreme Court of New South Wales. It was later revealed that the Lambs had opposed NBN&#x27;s purchase of the Star newspaper (created and owned by Wansey) and the attempt to buy 2HD. The company also faced possible suspension from the Australian Securities Exchange if a decision was not made soon. To resolve the tension, NBN sold NWS-9 to the Lambs in exchange for the majority stake in NBN in 1982. With the buy-out of community shares in NBN, the station ceased to be what Hunter residents considered to be &quot;their own&quot;. It came at a cost. Wansey mortgaged his shares to Parry who called in the debt.

On 16 March 1983, Parry Corporation completed the purchase of NBN, delisting the company. Michael Wansey resigned from the board at the end of the year as a result. In 1984, plans for a second independent station in Newcastle had failed. During that time, NBN and ABC Newcastle (call sign ABHN-5A) were asked to leave the VHF band to accommodate FM radio. At the time, NBN&#x27;s audio carrier frequency could be listened to with a standard FM radio.

It was planned for NBN to transmit on UHF channel 51, and the ABC on UHF channel 48, however this did not eventuate. A proposal to launch a radiated subscription television service with community broadcasting during the daytime hours had also failed that year.

In the late 1980s, NBN&#x27;s Perth-based owner, Parry Corporation, spun off NBN Limited into a new company, NBN Enterprises, and took a 40 per cent stake in the new company, with Security Pacific Capital Corporation buying 60 per cent, sold their stake soon after, holding onto Papua New Guinea television station NTN, which NBN had helped to set up. Fulcrum Media&#x27;s move to later purchase the station was a source for confusion, as it was revealed that many companies, including the NSW State Superannuation Board and Westpac, held substantial stakes in Fulcrum Media. Parry Corporation&#x27;s new owner CityWest issued a court challenge to re-acquire NBN, but it was revealed that CityWest was held by Hong Kong company Hang Lung Properties, thereby violating foreign ownership laws. Following ownership changes, NBN Enterprises was sold to Washington H Soul Pattinson in October 1989.

NBN was one of many stations opposed to aggregation, and offered an alternative by opening up a second station which it would operate for a period of time before selling it. This proposal was however rejected, and aggregation occurred on 31 December 1991, with NBN acquiring Nine Network affiliation. Following aggregation, the station&#x27;s coverage expanded to cover all of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four hours in a day, in stereophonic sound. NBN Television&#x27;s 1977 logo however was retained until late 1994 when it was updated to feature the Nine Networks &#x27;nine dots&#x27; in a new logo similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.

===2000s===
Throughout the 2000s, NBN was regarded as one of the leaders in digital broadcasting, not only being the first to produce a nightly regional news bulletin in full digital format, using a digital friendly news set, but also Australia&#x27;s first fully digital outside broadcast van.

In 2004, Washington H. Soul Pattinson began moves to transfer control of the station to its publicly listed subsidiary, Soul Pattinson Telecommunications, which became SP Telemedia as a result.

On 30 January 2006, NBN adopted a new logo and on air graphics, in line with Nine&#x27;s new logo. However, the news department did not update its graphics until 15 March. During April 2007, SP Telemedia announced that it would consider selling NBN Television, and had received at least two bids, one each from WIN Corporation and PBL Media. On 9 May 2007, PBL Media&#x27;s $250 million bid became final, winning the sale. However, upon acquiring NBN, PBL did not fold it into the main Nine Network, but continued to operate it as a regional independent station until 2016. The purchase also secured permanent status of supplying Nine&#x27;s content to the station&#x27;s entire coverage area, sparing any future affiliation switches (particularly the 2016 Australian television shakeup involving Southern Cross Austereo and WIN Corporation). The affiliation switch was reversed in July 2021.

Following Nine&#x27;s relaunch of their high definition simulcast as &quot;Nine HD&quot; on 17 March 2008, NBN launched their own HD simulcast in mid-2008 called &quot;NBN HD&quot;.

On 9 August 2009, NBN began transmission of the new digital channel GO! on channel 88.

===2010s===
In 2010, it was announced that two of NBN&#x27;s inner Newcastle retransmitter sites in Charlestown and Cooks Hill were selected to carry 3D broadcasts of the 2010 State of Origin series. On 26 September 2010, NBN began transmission of the HD digital channel GEM on channel 80.

In January 2012, NBN celebrated 50 years of broadcasting across Northern NSW and the Gold Coast. Coincidentally, it also marked 20 years since the station took Nine&#x27;s signal across all of Northern NSW. On 26 March 2012, NBN began transmission of Nine&#x27;s metropolitan informercial channel Extra on channel 84.

On 27 January 2014, along with the Nine Network, NBN switched from the Supertext logo to Nine&#x27;s Closed Captioning logo.

After Nine revived 9HD and launched new lifestyle channel 9Life on 26 November 2015, NBN made no announcements of its intent to follow Nine&#x27;s move in regional areas, instead continuing to broadcast 9Gem&#x27;s HD feed on channel 80. NBN released a statement on its website days before the 9HD relaunch, saying that efforts are made to upgrade its stations across the region. On 10 February 2016, Nine Entertainment announced that NBN would receive both 9HD and 9Life in &quot;coming months&quot;, with further confirmation on 16 February that they would launch on 1 March 2016. As a result, their channel listing was reshuffled to match to Nine&#x27;s metropolitan listing with 9Gem on channel 82, 9Go! on channel 83, 9Life on channel 84 and Extra on channel 85.

On 9 February 2016, it was announced that Kylie Blucher, managing director of QTQ Brisbane, would be appointed managing director of NBN while retaining her position at QTQ, stating that she would &quot;be splitting [her] time between Brisbane and Newcastle&quot;.

Alongside the launch of 9HD and 9Life on 1 March 2016, NBN&#x27;s unique branding began to be phased out in favour of Nine&#x27;s mainstream branding already in place on its metropolitan stations and its Darwin station. The mainstream logos for Nine and 9HD were used with &quot;NBN&quot; written alongside in a smaller font. On 1 July 2016, coinciding with the media shakeup of WIN and Southern Cross, NBN&#x27;s unique branding was completely phased out. As a result, NBN was folded into the Nine Network. But for the time being &quot;NBN News&quot; remains under its unique name and the small &quot;NBN&quot; on the Nine watermark is still used in areas where NBN&#x27;s signal overlaps with TCN Sydney and QTQ Brisbane to differentiate between the stations. However, NBN continued to cover the Nine News logo on all network national news bulletins until July 2018. Until 2020, the &quot;NBN News&quot; coverup was used on the 4 pm news in Sydney, however that is no longer the case. The coverup is still used on the 4 pm news in Queensland on the Gold Coast feed.

In October 2016, Nine Entertainment lodged a development application with Newcastle City Council about plans to turn the current NBN studios into medium density housing. As a result of this, the network is planning on moving NBN somewhere in the Newcastle CBD. During this time, it was unclear whether NBN News would be retained under its current name following the move to the new workspace. Studio presentation was also uncertain once the transfer occurs.

In March 2018, Nine&#x27;s regional affiliate Southern Cross Austereo began advertising sales for NBN. As a result, the advertising department moved from NBN&#x27;s offices to SCA&#x27;s radio offices.

In June 2018, Nine Entertainment moved NBN&#x27;s playout facilities to the networks main playout centre in Frenchs Forest, Sydney as part of Nine&#x27;s plans to integrate NBN into the network.

===2020s===
In November 2021, after almost 60 years broadcasting from the Mosbri Crescent studios, NBN moved to new state of the art facilities located at 28 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle. This will allow NBN to update its ageing technology and grow the business. It was also announced that upon completion of the move, the name &quot;NBN News&quot; will be retained for the 6 pm bulletin, thus for now resting any speculation that the bulletin will be rebadged as Nine News as well as speculation that studio presentation of the news would be relocated to the network&#x27;s new North Sydney Studios. The move was originally meant to be completed in June 2021, but following the hacking situation that occurred at Nine&#x27;s North Sydney studios in March, and statewide COVID-19 lockdowns across New South Wales, the planned move was pushed back to November.

On 30 November 2020, Jenny Webber, head of commercial production for both Nine Queensland (QTQ) and Nine Northern NSW would be appointed into the new role of General Manager for NBN overseeing the stations commercial department &quot;Nine Digital Production&quot;, the stations day-to-day operations, as well as oversee local digital advertising agent &quot;Nine Digital Direct&quot;. Kylie Blucher would retain her role as managing director of both QTQ and NBN.

On 7 November 2021, the station transmitted its local programming from the Mosbri Crescent studios for the final time, preceded by 30-minute tribute special &quot; Goodbye Mosbri&quot;, a look back of 59 years of news bulletins, telethons and top rating local programs as well as the history of NBN Television. The station completed its move to Honeysuckle the following day.

In March 2022, NBN celebrated 60 years of broadcasting across Northern NSW and the Gold Coast. Coincidentally, it also marked 30 years since the station took Nine&#x27;s signal across all of Northern NSW.

==News operation==
NBN News is the station&#x27;s flagship local evening news bulletin, airing every night at 6 pm. The news service employs 60 staff and produces over 20,000 local news stories annually, combined with news reports from Nine News; with local stories in all of its sub-markets. Since November 2021, master control for NBN News is operated by QTQ&#x27;s Mount Coot-tha facility in Brisbane, with the Newcastle studios and news reports across New South Wales passing through microwave and satellite.

NBN News is unique as it simulcasts live across all six markets. After the major national stories are presented, the program is split into six &quot;Local Window&quot; opt-outs, featuring pre-recorded local bulletins for each regional market and a live local news round-up for Newcastle. After the first break, the bulletin continues as a live simulcast across the network with further &quot;Local Window&quot; opt-outs for sport and weather. News, sport and weather presenters start early at NBN recording introductions to each of the local stories which will be included in the opt-outs. Local bureaus are located in Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour, Central Coast, Tamworth, Lismore and the Gold Coast.

As a network O&amp;O, the following Nine News programs are relayed to the station: &quot;Nine News: Early Edition&quot;, &quot;Today &amp; Weekend Today&quot;, &quot;Today Extra &amp; Today Extra: Saturday&quot;, &quot;Nine&#x27;s Morning News&quot;, &quot;Nine&#x27;s Afternoon News Sydney&quot; (Northern NSW only), &quot;Nine&#x27;s Afternoon News Brisbane&quot; (Gold Coast only), &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, &quot;Nine News Late&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Nine News: First at Five&quot; and until 2020, &quot;Nine News Now&quot;. Nine&#x27;s flagship nightly news bulletin (either &quot;Nine News Sydney&quot; or &quot;Nine News Queensland&quot;) is not broadcast across Northern NSW and the Gold Coast, Nine&#x27;s flagship local news bulletin &quot;Nine News Gold Coast&quot; is also not broadcast across the Gold Coast, since NBN News serves as the station&#x27;s flagship bulletin. Prior to the network rebrand on 1 July 2016, &quot;Nine&#x27;s Morning News&quot; was only broadcast on special occasions.

In the Hunter and the Central Coast, it is the only local news bulletin, as rival networks Seven and WIN provide news updates as part of fulfilling local quota requirements. NBN News shares resources with Nine Gold Coast News for its Gold Coast reporting since NEC&#x27;s ownership of the station. From 2017 to 2021, the station also provided local weather segments for Nine&#x27;s regional NSW, Victoria and Queensland bulletins.

=== News department history ===
Throughout its history, NBN News produced &quot;Good Morning News&quot;, &quot;Good Evening News&quot;, &quot;News Night&quot;, &quot;NBN Evening News&quot;, and &quot;NBN Late Edition News&quot; and currently running &quot;NBN News&quot;.

NBN was the first to launch an hour-long news bulletin in April 1972 from its long-time Mosbri Crescent building, and from launch night until the 1980s, Murray Finlay was the face of NBN&#x27;s news bulletins, and was one of Australia&#x27;s longest serving newsreaders. In 1975, Finlay was joined by Ray Dinneen, who went onto become its main anchor until retirement in December 2010. In 1979, the news service received an award for its coverage of the Star Hotel riot.

On 1 March 1985, Jim Sullivan began his career as NBN&#x27;s news director, which has ultimately led him to become Australia&#x27;s longest serving news director. The station&#x27;s coverage of the tragic events of the 1989 Newcastle earthquake was beamed throughout the world, with NBN&#x27;s reporters also being interviewed by international news services.

During the 1990s, NBN also produced breakfast, afternoon and late night bulletins, however this was later replaced by the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; bulletin, and subsequently, other national bulletins from Nine News.

On 11 September 2001 liaising with NBN News director Jim Sullivan, &quot;NBN Late Edition News&quot; producer Matthew Carden secured a live feed through the Nine Network of ABC America enabling first pictures to be aired of the New York attacks within minutes. When the program went on air a short time later, newsreader Jodi McKay handed over to ABC News America&#x27;s coverage of events, anchored by Peter Jennings. The bulletin was extended until 1am when NBN handed over to TCN for the start of almost five days of continuous national coverage.

In 2006, NBN aired its 20,000th news bulletin during the week of 26 March; commemorating the event, NBN News produced five news specials that summarised the prior 44 years of news production.

In mid 2006, Natasha Beyersdorf took over as the network&#x27;s main female newsreader after Melinda Smith stepped down from the role. Paul Lobb took over as the network&#x27;s main male newsreader and one of the network&#x27;s local identities after Ray Dinneen retired on 17 December 2010.

In December 2014, Mike Rabbitt retired from reading sport on NBN News after nearly 30 years with the station. Mitchell Hughes was appointed his replacement.

Following the appointment of Kylie Blucher as the station&#x27;s managing director, NBN News opener and graphics were relaunched, aligning with Nine&#x27;s metropolitan and Darwin stations, yet retaining the well-known theme music composed by Laurence Schuberth. For the first time, the title cards used on Nine News were adapted as part of the refresh. Although a &quot;lite&quot; version of the graphics was introduced in February 2014, it did not become identical with Nine News until April 2016. Following the relaunch of Nine News graphics on 16 October of that year, NBN News refreshed its presentation by phases. The opener and title cards were first updated, followed by its weather graphics in February 2017 (when it began providing weather for then-Nine&#x27;s affiliate CTC until 2021). A new set based on the previous Nine News sets was introduced on 7 August. The rest of the graphics were soon updated to the then-current Nine News look on 15 October 2018. On 19 January 2020, NBN News was updated to reflect the current Nine News graphics updated on the same day.

In December 2020, Paul Lobb and Natasha Beyersdorf marked 10 years as weeknight news presenters on the network. Coincidentally, it marked 10 years since Paul Lobb replaced Ray Dinneen as main male news presenter and one of the network&#x27;s local identities back in 2010.

In August 2021, as part of Jenny Webber&#x27;s appointment to NBN&#x27;s day-to-day operations, major changes were imposed on NBN News: the station&#x27;s Head of News Blake Doyle and Chief of Staff Andy Lobb were made redundant, taking with them a combined 40 years experience in local television production, with former Nine Perth reporter Darius Winterfield and former Nine Adelaide reporter Olivia Grace Curran to replace them as head of news and chief of staff, respectively. 20 positions were affected and 5 of its staff were redeployed to Nine&#x27;s QTQ studios in Brisbane, where NBN News will begin master control operations from November. It was also confirmed that the new studio in Honeysuckle Drive will be automated with a state-of-the-art set similar to the current Nine News set in North Sydney, with construction that began from May 2021. It is said that there will be closer ties with Nine News including more opportunities for camera operators, reporters and journalists. Coincidentally, the QTQ master control they will be using was the same master control used for Nine News&#x27; regional bulletins across Queensland from 2017 to 2021, when Nine had its 5-year programming supply agreement with SCA&#x27;s regional Queensland station TNQ. The new master control site also formally introduces the Nine News theme remix of &quot;Cool Hand Luke&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Tar Sequence&quot; to NBN News, formally replacing numerous themes commissioned separately in the past 60 years. The new arrangements for NBN News began on 8 November 2021.

On 13 December 2021, it was announced that Lobb would be made redundant after a decade as weeknight news presenter and almost 30 years with the network. Gavin Morris will replace Lobb as weeknight news presenter and one of the network&#x27;s main male personalities in addition to presenting the weather.

==Programming==

Until midway through the 2000s, NBN had always produced some local programming, and had set a record for most local programming and transmission hours in its first week of operation. It was also a member of Australian Television Facilities, and had a hand in the production of drama series &quot;Silent Number&quot;. Since NBN was bought by PBL Media in May 2007, then merged into the Nine Network in August 2016, apart from NBN News, local programming on the station has decreased significantly, although in the last two years, NBN has resumed production on local programming, but on a limited basis. However, since the move to Honeysuckle, local programming has ceased altogether with NBN News the only local production on the station.
In 1963, NBN won the Logie Award for Enterprising Programming (which was only for country stations), and another Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station award in 1978. NBN purchased the &quot;Romper Room&quot; franchise from Fremantle International in 1967, which broadcast for over three decades. The original hostess was Miss Anne, followed by Miss Lyn, Miss Pauline and finally, Miss Kim who hosted the program until its demise due to &#x27;political correctness&#x27;. (For example, a favourite feature called &#x27;bounce-the-ball&#x27; was deemed inappropriate because not all children could bounce a ball). At first the &#x27;Miss&#x27;s&#x27; were assisted by NBN&#x27;s station mascot, Buttons the Cat, who underwent a number of incarnations as its costume aged and became outdated. Later, Buttons was retired, being replaced by Humphrey B Bear (as NBN had gained the rights to the character through their purchase of Southern Television Corporation), A Local suited character was then determined to be more suitable for a regional television station and the concept of Big Dog was created, the character and suit were created in Wyong on the NSW Central Coast and Big Dog came into being.

Local travel agency Jayes presented their own travel show, &quot;Travel Time with Jayes&quot;, broadcast on Sunday nights for over 20 years, starting in 1962. Also, every four years, NBN produced a live 24-hour telethon to raise money for local charities. However, due to NBN&#x27;s affiliation with the Nine Network from 1991 onwards, these telethons were no longer viable with the last occurring in 2002.

NBN premiered &quot;Today Extra&quot; in 1989. The lifestyle program was broadcast three days per week as part of NBN&#x27;s day-time line-up. On 3 January 2007, it was announced that NBN would axe &quot;Today Extra&quot;, claiming it was no longer economically viable, with a drop in ratings and a shrinking advertising base. The program&#x27;s axing ended the career for former weatherman Nat Jeffery, who presented the program for 18 years, and worked at the station for 28 years. The &quot;Today Extra&quot; name was later used for a rebrand of &quot;Mornings&quot; on the Nine Network (NBN&#x27;s affiliation partner) in 2016.

In 2015, NBN produced a local children&#x27;s program which aired on the GO! Channel (later shortened today as &quot;9Go!&quot;) called &quot;So There&quot;. The program was presented by NBN News reporter Renee Fedder. It lasted eight episodes.

In August 2018, the station announced a new lifestyle program called &quot;Location Lifestyle Living&quot;. The show featured a mix of lifestyle, lighthearted segments, interviews, renovation tips and real estate stories. Craig Rosevear and Renovation expert Naomi Finlay hosted the program. It ran until October. The program was renewed for a second season and aired from 7 September 2019 – 9 November 2019. Finlay however, did not return for Season 2, she was replaced by then NBN News reporter Georgia Maher. The program was renewed for a third season, traditionally the program is broadcast from late August to Early November, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the third season started its broadcast in late November and premiered on Saturday 14 November 2020. Craig Rosevear is now solo host due to the departure of Georgia Maher in early 2020. The show was not renewed for a fourth season, most likely due to the extended COVID lockdown, and due to staffing changes and cuts at the station in relation to the move to new studios at Honeysuckle. 
In 2020, the station expanded into digital programming, with the launch of &quot;Amplified &quot; a music show giving local music a voice and home to some of the best up and coming musicians. The program was hosted by Matt Field and aired at 8 pm Thursdays on NBN&#x27;s Facebook page, episodes were then repeated on 9Go! on Saturday afternoons. It lasted one season.

In late April 2020, the station launched into the sports market with the launch of &quot;Knights to Remember&quot;, a weekly show looking back on some of the best moments of football games featuring the &quot;Newcastle Knights&quot; team over many years. The program was presented by NBN News Sport Reporters Stephen Mount and Kate Haberfield and is broadcast at 12 pm Saturdays. The program was a joint venture between NBN and real estate agent &#x27;MacDonald Jones Homes&#x27; and lasted one season.

As of 2021, NBN primarily airs Nine Network programming mixed with local weather updates during the afternoon news, regular NBN news updates through the evening, the main NBN News bulletin at 6pm and some local programming including the Newcastle Anzac Day dawn service live, 60 year anniversary specials, Big Dog and localised station IDs and local advertising customised for each market.

==Community support==
NBN has long been a supporter of many local events and groups in the Northern NSW/Gold Coast region. They are currently sponsors of the Newcastle Northstars in the Australian Ice Hockey League. The station has sponsored the Newcastle Knights NRL rugby league team for most of the 1990s and the 2000s, with the NBN logo visible on the team&#x27;s uniform the station also sponsored the Gold Coast Chargers from 1996 to 1998. The former Hunter Pirates NBL basketball team (and their predecessor, the Newcastle Falcons) as well as the Newcastle United Jets soccer team (and their predecessor, the Newcastle Breakers), have also both received sponsorship from Nine Northern NSW.

==Logos==
The original NBN logo, featuring the numeral three inside a ring was replaced by several others over the years. The three was used due to the station&#x27;s frequency allocation, being transmitted on VHF channel 3 from a transmitter atop Mount Sugarloaf near Newcastle. By 1977, the logo was updated with the letters NBN replacing the numeral three. The blue and green logo coincided with the renaming of the station from &quot;Channel 3&quot; to the current name, &quot;NBN Television&quot;, and its parent company subsequently renaming from &quot;Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation&quot; to &quot;NBN Limited&quot; on 22 November 1979.

Despite pressure from the Nine Network to adopt the nine dots, NBN Television retained its logo for a few years after aggregation. However, in 1994, NBN added nine dots into a new logo designed similarly to the Nine Network&#x27;s, and also began using Nine&#x27;s on-air promotion, with the NBN logo replacing Nine&#x27;s. In 1997, the dots were changed to spheres.

Three-dimensions were added to the letters NBN in 2002, coinciding with a revamp of the station&#x27;s on-air identity, concurrently with the Nine Network. On 30 January 2006, the station relaunched its logo to coincide with the Nine Network&#x27;s fiftieth year of broadcasting. The new logo designed by Bruce Dunlop Associates saw the removal of the nine dots, with a blue square added to behind the letters NBN. However, in 2008, the nine dots were reinstated into the logo and the dots are first 3D discs in 2008, then 2D dots in January 2009, then later spheres in September 2009.

In April 2012, NBN Television&#x27;s identity changed, applying the logo in different colours such as red, green, purple and more. It is also reminiscent of the 2002 ident package.

Since July 2016, the NBN logo has only been used as a digital on-screen graphic and for use for NBN News, station identification and community announcements with the remaining identity using Nine Network branding.

<doc id="642236" wikidata="Q2612725" url="?curid=642236" title="163rd Street–Amsterdam Avenue station">
<text>The 163rd Street–Amsterdam Avenue station is a local station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, located in Washington Heights, Manhattan, at the intersection of Amsterdam and Saint Nicholas Avenues. It is served by the C train at all times except nights, when the A train takes over service.

==History==
The station opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND)&#x27;s initial segment, the Eighth Avenue Line between Chambers Street and 207th Street. Construction of the whole line cost $191.2 million (equivalent to $ million in . While the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line already provided service to Washington Heights, the new Eighth Avenue subway via St. Nicholas Avenue provided an alternative route.

Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, the station underwent a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative and was entirely closed for several months. Updates included cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps. A request for proposals for the 72nd Street, 86th Street, Cathedral Parkway–110th Street, and 163rd Street–Amsterdam Avenue stations was issued on June 1, 2017, and the New York City Transit and Bus Committee officially recommended that the MTA Board should award the $111 million contract to ECCO III Enterprises in October 2017. As part of the renovations, the station was closed on March 12, 2018 and reopened on September 27, 2018.

==Station layout==
This underground station has two local tracks and two side platforms. Two express tracks, used by the A train during daytime hours, run below the station and are not visible from the platforms. To the north, the upper level local tracks become the center tracks of 168th Street, allowing C trains to terminate there, while the lower level express tracks become the outer tracks, continuing towards 207th Street.

Both platforms have mosaic name tablets reading &quot;163RD STREET - AMSTERDAM AVE.&quot; in white sans-serif lettering broken onto two lines. The background is yellow with a black border. Small black &quot;163&quot; and directional signs in white lettering run at regular intervals, but there is no trim line on either platform. Grey (previously yellow) I-beam columns run along both platforms, alternating ones having the standard black station name plate with white lettering.
The trim line was part of a color-coded tile system used throughout the IND. The tile colors were designed to facilitate navigation for travelers going away from Lower Manhattan. As such, the yellow tiles used at the 163rd Street station were originally also used at , the next express station to the south, while a different tile color is used at , the next express station to the north. Yellow tiles are similarly used at the 155th Street station, the only other local station between 145th Street and 168th Street.

This station has a full length mezzanine supported by I-beam columns above the platforms, but only the southern half is opened. The open southern half has three staircases from each platform, black I-beams, and two sets of turnstile banks leading to the center or the extreme south end of the mezzanine. The closed northern half is walled off and retained the original yellow-colored I-beams. The staircases from the platforms to this portion have been removed.

Prior to the station&#x27;s renovation, the open southern half was split into three sections by two black steel fences, and free transfers between directions were not possible. Outside fare control, there is a token booth. The closed northern half was gated off and had an exit-only turnstile leading to the fare control area at the center, and three gated staircases from each platform.

The 2018 artwork at this station is &quot;Ciguapa Antellana, me llamo sueño de la madrugada. (who more sci-fi than us)&quot;, a glass mosaic by Firelei Báez. The artwork consists of four pieces, two on the mezzanine and one on each platform. The mosaic contains leaves and vines, as well as symbolism that is evocative of Baez&#x27;s Caribbean ancestry.

===Exits===
Despite the station&#x27;s name, there is no longer an open exit to 163rd Street. The closed northern half had three exits leading to 163rd Street. By the late 1980s, the exits were closed and eventually sealed. Two of the exits went to the southwest corner, while the third exit, which was temporarily uncovered as an area to haul out debris from renovations, went to the southeast corner.

The open southern half of the mezzanine has three exits:
* One stair at the southeast corner of 161st Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
* One stair at the northeast corner of 161st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue.
* One stair built inside 1033 Saint Nicholas Avenue (at the western corner of 162nd Street and Amsterdam Avenue)

<doc id="642238" wikidata="Q3297739" url="?curid=642238" title="Matt Clement">
<text>Matthew Paul Clement (born August 12, 1974) is an American former Major League Baseball starting pitcher. Clement played for the San Diego Padres (–), Florida Marlins (), Chicago Cubs (–) and Boston Red Sox (–). While on the Red Sox active roster, he was injured throughout the 2007 season. He batted and threw right-handed.

Clement had a sinking fastball in the low 90s and a hard slider he mixed with a four-seamer and a changeup. In nine seasons, Clement won 87 games and lost 86, and was 1–2 in post-season play, going 1–1 with the Cubs in 2003 and 0–1 with Boston in 2005. His win in Game 4 of the 2003 National League Championship Series at Florida brought the Cubs within one game of the pennant. He held opposing batters to a .233 batting average from 2002 to 2005, while posting a 47–42 record and a 3.99 ERA.

==Baseball career==
In 2000, Clement led the major leagues in walks (125) and led the National League in wild pitches three times between 2000 and 2003.

In June 2004, Clement was 6-2 and a candidate to be named to the All-Star Game. But in his next six starts before the break, Clement went 0–4 despite a 2.15 ERA during that span; his run support in those starts was just 1.19 runs per game. He finished the season with a 3.68 ERA but went 9-13 for the Cubs, who scored only 79 runs in his 30 starts (2.63 runs of support per game, the sixth-lowest mark in the NL). Against American League teams in inter-league play, Clement had a 7–7 record with a 3.60 ERA in 19 starts.

As a member of the Boston Red Sox in the 2005 season, Clement was named as an All-Star Game selection for the first time in his big league career, replacing injured Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay. Clement&#x27;s record was 10-2 before the All-Star break, and he finished the season at 13–6 with a 4.57 ERA. On July 26, 2005, Clement was struck in the head by a line drive from Carl Crawford of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.

Clement made just 12 starts in 2006, posting a 5–5 record with a 6.61 ERA, before having season ending shoulder surgery in September. He was rehabilitated at the Red Sox extended spring training complex in Fort Myers, Florida, but did not make a major league appearance in the 2007 season.

On January 3, , Clement was signed to a major league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals&#x27; team doctor said that Clement was healthy and would be able to begin the season playing regularly. The Cardinals cited his recent rehabilitation and physical as reasons for adding him to the starting rotation for the 2008 season with no expected limitations upon reporting to Jupiter, Florida for spring training. However, Clement would begin the year on the disabled list after making no appearances in Spring training. On June 3, Clement made a minor-league rehab start at Single-A Palm Beach, allowing only 1 hit over six innings. He was released by the Cardinals on August 2.

Clement signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on December 12, 2008, and was invited to Spring training.

After being unable to make a spot in the rotation, Clement announced his retirement from baseball on April 5, 2009.

==Personal life==
, Clement identified as an evangelical Christian.

After retiring from baseball, Clement permanently moved back to his hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, where he became the head coach of the boys&#x27; basketball team at his high school alma mater, Butler Senior High School. He also was part of an ownership group that purchased the Butler BlueSox.

<text>Guido Buffarini Guidi (17 August 1895 – 10 July 1945) was an Italian army officer and politician, executed for war atrocities during the Italian Civil War in 1945.

==Biography==

Buffarini Guidi was born in Pisa in 1895. When Italy entered World War I, he volunteered in an artillery regiment. He was promoted to rank of captain in 1917, and remained on active duty in the Italian Army until 1923 – in the meantime, he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in law from the University of Pisa in March 1920.

After leaving the army, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, he became active in Fascist circles, and joined the National Fascist Party (PNF). A mayor of Pisa in April 1923, Buffarini Guidi headed the local Party hierarchy from 1924 (his notoriety being increased by his career as a lawyer). He rose to become honorary Consul of the MVSN Blackshirts - the voluntary militia after the March on Rome.

In May 1933, he was appointed to be Undersecretary Minister of Interior, and forged an alliance with Galeazzo Ciano - opposing the Party bureaucracy, creating several secret services, and attempting to lessen the effects of Antisemitic legislation passed by the regime. Nevertheless, (and unlike Ciano), on 25 July 1943, Buffarini Guidi voted in favor of Benito Mussolini during Dino Grandi&#x27;s attempt to have the latter deposed and get Italy to sign a peace with the Allies. As a reward, after Nazi Germany intervened and rescued Mussolini in September, Guido Buffarini Guidi was appointed Minister of the Interior of the new Italian Social Republic (established by Nazis in Northern Italy). Seen as extremely avaricious, he was distrusted even by most of his cabinet colleagues.

Near the end of the Republic&#x27;s life, in February 1945, Mussolini dismissed Buffarini Guidi from office. After a failed attempt to escape to Switzerland, he was arrested by the partisans on 26 April. Like any other Italian Fascist prosecuted for engaging in the Italian Civil War, he was tried under Italian law since the laws of war at the time had no provisions dealing with non-international armed conflict (NIAC). He was sentenced to death for atrocities committed in the Italian Civil War by an Extraordinary Court of Justice in Milan. He was executed by firing squad on 10 July, having tried (like French collaborator Pierre Laval) and failed to commit suicide while in captivity.

While in prison, Guidi offered to reveal to the Allies compromising letters exchanged between Churchill and Mussolini during the war in exchange for his release; he was unsuccessful.

== Appearances in film ==

In the 1973 film &quot;Massacre in Rome&quot;, Guido Guidi is portrayed by Italian actor Guidarino Guidi.

<text>Salim Joubran (, ; 1947 – 15 March 2024) was a judge of the Supreme Court of Israel. He served as a Supreme Court justice from 2003, and became a permanent member in May 2004. Joubran was of Christian Maronite heritage and affiliated with the Arab Christian community. Joubran was the first Arab to receive a &quot;permanent&quot; appointment in the Israeli Supreme Court. He was also described as the second Arab judge to hold a Supreme Court appointment, preceded by Abdel Rahman Zuabi, who held a fixed nine-month appointment in 1999.

==Biography==
Salim Joubran was born in the German Colony neighborhood of Haifa, Mandatory Palestine, to a Christian family of Maronite Lebanese origin.

Joubran graduated from the Terra Santa School of the Franciscan Order in Acre. He earned a law degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and entered private practice as a lawyer in 1970.

Joubran has four children, three of whom are lawyers. His son Charbel is a lawyer in the field of sports and represents football players in Israel and abroad.

Joubran died on 15 March 2024, at the age of 76.

==Legal career==

In 1982, Joubran left private practice after 12 years to accept an appointment as a judge on Haifa&#x27;s Magistrate&#x27;s Court, where he served for 11 years. In 1993, he was appointed to Haifa&#x27;s district court, and served in that capacity for another 10 years, following which he was elevated to the Supreme Court first as a temporary and then as a permanent judge.

Joubran was an expert on criminal law. He was also the first Arab to chair the Central Elections Committee. In the 2013 Israeli municipal elections, he barred the national ruling party Likud&#x27;s advertisements for being &quot;racist and almost certain to hurt the feelings of Arab Israelis and disrupt public order&quot;. This also overruled the advice of Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, who suggested the committee had no authority to regulate online advertisements and posters.

Joubran was appointed justice in the Supreme Court of Israel in 2004. He was appointed deputy to the Supreme Court chief justice on 12 June 2017.
He retired later in 2017, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 70.

==Academic and public positions==
Joubran was a lecturer at the Law Faculty at the University of Haifa. He served as governor of Israel Rotary (dist. 2490), and chairman of the Zeltner Fund for legal research sponsored by Rotary Israel and Tel Aviv University.

<doc id="642261" wikidata="Q115805401" url="?curid=642261" title="Counts of Louvain">
<text>The Counts of Louvain were a branch of the Lotharingian House of Reginar which from the late 10th century ruled over the estates of Louvain (&quot;French&quot;) or Leuven (&quot;Dutch&quot;) in Lower Lorraine.

==History==
The likely ancestor of the Reginars, Gilbert, Count of the Maasgau, a vassal of the West Frankish king Charles the Bald, married a daughter of the Carolingian emperor Lothair I in 846. Reginar I &quot;longneck&quot;, possibly his son, was the most powerful noble in the now kingless kingdom of Lotharingia (Lorraine), in the period from 910 to 915. His son and successor Gilbert swore fealty to the East Frankish king Henry the Fowler in 925 and three years later married his daughter Gerberga of Saxony. His younger brother&#x27;s son Reginar III held lands in the region of Mons.

About 990, Lambert the Bearded (d. 1015), son of Count Reginar III, married Gerberga, daughter of the Carolingian duke Charles of Lower Lorraine, and by 1003 he was being described as a Count of Louvain. His county, with its original capital of Louvain built upon the Dyle river, between the old Pagus of Brabant and Pagus of Hasbania, rapidly increased in size and power. In 1013, Lambert annexed part of the county of Bruningrode, located between Louvain and Tienen, and this became a source of long-running conflict with the prince-bishops of Liège.

Lambert&#x27;s family gained great influence in the Holy Roman Empire, acquiring more comital titles over time. His son Lambert II is also mentioned as a count of Brussels, where he had the St. Michael&#x27;s Church erected to house the relics of Saint Gudula. When he joined the rebellion of Count Baldwin V of Flanders against Emperor Henry III, he was killed in a 1054 battle at Tournai.

Lambert&#x27;s grandson, Count Henry III of Louvain was vested with the title of a Landgrave of Brabant upon the death of the Ezzonid count palatine Hermann II of Lotharingia in 1085. 

In the early 12th century, Henry III was succeeded by his brother Godfrey I, who was entrusted with the imperial Dukedom of Lower Lotharingia, and Margraviate of Antwerp after Henry of Limbourg fell out of favour. Although the title was later given back to the lords of Limbourg-sur-Vesdre, Godefrey and his family refused to stop using the title, and kept possession of Antwerp. The ensuing conflict between the families led to the eventual abolishment of the Duchy, and the two families came to be known as the Dukes of Brabant and Limbourg respectively.

==Counts of Louvain and Brussels==
* 1003–1015: Lambert I, was the first Count of Louvain, son of Reginar III Count of Hainaut
* 1015–1038: Henry I, (son of Lambert I)
* 1038–1040: Otto
* 1040–1054: Lambert II, (son of Lambert I)
* 1054–1079: Henry II, (son of Lambert II)
* 1079–1086: Henry III, (son of Henry II)

==Counts of Louvain and Brussels, Landgraves of Brabant==
* 1086–1095: Henry III, (son of Henry II)
* 1095–1106: Godfrey I, (son of Henry II)

==Counts of Louvain and Brussels, Landgraves of Brabant, Dukes of Lower-Lorraine==
* 1106–1128: Godfrey I, (son of Henry II)
* 1128–1141: Godfrey II, (son of Godfrey I)
* 1141–1190: Godfrey III, (son of Godrey II)

From 1183 onwards, the titles of Count of Louvain, Count of Brussels and Landgrave of Brabant were merged in the title of Duke of Brabant and used as appanages.</text><links>

<text>The Romanian leu (, plural lei ; ISO code: RON; numeric code: 946) is the currency of Romania. It is subdivided into 100 (, singular: ), a word that also means &quot;money&quot; in the Romanian language.

== Etymology ==
The name of the currency means &quot;lion&quot;, and is derived from the Dutch thaler ( &quot;lion thaler/dollar&quot;). The Dutch &quot;leeuwendaalder&quot; was imitated in several German and Italian cities. These coins circulated in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria and gave their name to their respective currencies: the &quot;Romanian leu&quot;, the &quot;Moldovan leu&quot; and the &quot;Bulgarian lev&quot;.
==History==
===First leu: 1867–1947===


In 1860, the Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza attempted to create a national &quot;românul&quot; (&quot;the Romanian&quot;) and the &quot;romanat&quot;; however, the project was not approved by the Ottoman Empire.

On 22 April 1867, a bimetallic currency was adopted, with the leu equal to 5 grams of 83.5% silver or 0.29032 grams of gold. The first leu coin was minted in Romania in 1870.

Before 1878 the silver Russian ruble was valued so highly as to drive the native coins out of circulation. Consequently, in 1889, Romania unilaterally joined the Latin Monetary Union and adopted a gold standard. Silver coins were legal tender only up to 50 lei. All taxes and customs dues were to be paid in gold and, owing to the small quantities issued from the Romanian mint, foreign gold coins were current, especially French 20-franc pieces (equal at par to 20 lei), Ottoman lira (22.70 lei), Russian rubles (20.60 lei) and British sovereigns (25.22 lei).

Romania left the gold standard in 1914 and the leu&#x27;s value fell. The exchange rate was pegged at 167.20 lei to US$1 on 7 February 1929, US$1 = 135.95 lei on 5 November 1936, US$1 = 204.29 lei on 18 May 1940, and US$1 = 187.48 lei on 31 March 1941. During Romania&#x27;s World War II alliance with Nazi Germany, the leu was pegged to the reichsmark at a rate of 49.50 lei to RM 1, falling to 59.5 lei = RM 1 in April 1941. During Soviet occupation, the exchange rate was 1 ruble to 100 lei. After the war, the value of the currency fell dramatically and the National Bank issued a new leu, which was worth 20,000 old lei.

===Second leu (ROS): 1947–1952===
A revaluation (&quot;Great stabilization&quot;, &quot;&quot;) took place on 15 August 1947, replacing the old leu at a rate of 20,000 old lei = 1 stabilized leu. No advance warning was given and there were limits for the sums to be converted in the new currency: 5 million old lei for farmers and 3 million old lei for workers and pensioners.

Out of the 48.5 billion old lei in circulation, only around half were changed to stabilized lei. The most affected was the middle and upper classes, who were later also affected by the nationalization of 1948. At the time of its introduction, 150 new lei equalled 1 US dollar.

===Third leu (ROL): 1952–2005===

On 28 January 1952, another new leu was introduced. Unlike the previous revaluation, different rates were employed for different kinds of exchange (cash, bank deposits, debts etc.) and different amounts. These rates ranged from 20 to 400 &quot;old lei&quot; for one &quot;new&quot; leu. Again, no advance warning was given before the reform took place.

Between 1970 and 1989, the official exchange rate was fixed by the government through law. This exchange rate was used by the government to calculate the value of foreign trade, but foreign currency was not available to be bought and sold by private individuals. Owning or attempting to buy or sell foreign currency was a criminal offence, punishable with a prison sentence that could go up to ten years (depending on the amount of foreign currency found under one&#x27;s possession). International trade was therefore considered as part of another economic circuit than domestic trade, and given greater priority.

This inflexibility and the existence of surplus money due to constant economic decline in the 1980s, mixed with the need for more foreign currency and the refusal of the Ceaușescu regime to accept inflation as a phenomenon in order to attain convertibility, led to one of the greatest supply side crises in Romanian history, culminating with the introduction of partial food rationing in 1980 and full rationing for all basic foods in 1986/87. This was a major factor in growing discontent with Ceaușescu, and contributed in part to the fall of the Communist regime in 1989.

In the post-communist period, there has been a switch in the material used for banknotes and coins. Banknotes have switched from special paper to special plastic, while coins switched from aluminum to more common coin alloys (probably partly due to technical limitations of coin-operated vending machines). The transition has been gradual for both, but much faster for the banknotes which are currently all made of plastic. There has been a period in which all banknotes were made of plastic and all coins were made of aluminum, a very distinctive combination.

After the downfall of communism in the 1990s, inflation ran high due to reform failures, the legalization of owning foreign currency in 1990, reaching rates as high as 300% per year in 1993. By September 2003, one euro was exchanged for more than 40,000 lei, this being its peak value. Following a number of successful monetary policies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the situation became gradually more stable, with single-digit inflation in 2005.

The Romanian leu was briefly the world&#x27;s least valued currency unit, from January (when the Turkish lira dropped six zeros) to July 2005. However, the 1,000,000 lei banknote was not the highest Romanian denomination ever; a 5,000,000 lei note had been issued in 1947.

===Fourth leu (RON): 2005–present===
On 1 July 2005, the leu was revalued at the rate of 10,000 &quot;old&quot; lei (ROL) for one &quot;new&quot; leu (RON), thus psychologically bringing the purchasing power of the leu back in line with those of other major Western currencies. The term chosen for the action was &quot;denominare&quot;, similar to the English term &quot;redenomination&quot;. The adjustment was a difficult one for shoppers and many ATMs were inoperable and in need of reprogramming. The old ROL currency banknotes remained in circulation until 31 December 2006 (coins remained in circulation only until 31 December 2005), but all accounts were converted starting 1 July 2005. There is no conversion time limit between the currencies. Retailers had to display prices in both old and new currency from 1 March 2005 until 30 June 2006. The appreciation of the leu during 2005 was about 20% against a basket of major currencies.

As of 2006, the revaluation was a potential source of confusion, especially to visitors, since both old and new currency values were commonly quoted. When written, the very large amounts in old currency are usually obvious, but in speaking inhabitants might refer to an amount of 5 new lei as simply &quot;fifty&quot; in reference to its value of 50,000 old lei. As of 2020, it is still common to call 100 lei &quot;un milion&quot; or one million and 500 lei &quot;cinci milioane&quot; or five million.

===Speculation about joining the Eurozone===

In 2014, Romania&#x27;s Convergence Report set a target date of 1 January 2019 for euro adoption. In April 2014, Romania had met four out of the seven criteria for accession to the Eurozone. In recent years, however, Romania had made step backs regarding the adopting of the euro; the 2020 Convergence Report concluded that Romania does not meet any of the four economic criteria necessary for this process. In February 2021, then-Prime Minister Florin Cîțu stated that Romania could join the Eurozone in 2027 or 2028, although Romanian economist announced in December 2021 that this date had been delayed to 2029.

==Coins==

The size and composition of coins changed frequently after the introduction of the currency.

===First leu===

In 1867, copper 1, 2, 5 and 10 bani were issued, with gold 20 lei (known as &quot;poli&quot; after the French Napoleons) first minted the next year. These were followed, between 1870 and 1873, by silver 50 bani, 1 and 2 lei. Silver 5 lei were added in 1880. Uniquely, the 1867 issue used the spelling 1 banu rather than 1 ban.

In 1900, cupronickel 5, 10, and 20 ban coins were introduced, with holed versions following in 1905. The production of coins ceased in 1914, recommencing in 1921 with aluminum 25 and 50 ban pieces. Cupronickel 1 and 2 lei coins were introduced in 1924, followed by nickel brass 5, 10, and 20 lei in 1930. In 1932, silver 100 lei coins were issued. However, inflation meant that in 1935, smaller silver 250 lei coins were introduced with nickel 100 lei coins being issued in 1936, followed by nickel 50 lei in 1937.

In 1941 and 1942, zinc 2, 5, and 20 lei coins were introduced, together with silver 200 and 500 lei. Nickel-clad-steel 100 lei followed in 1943, with brass 200, and 500 lei issued in 1945. In 1946 and 1947, postwar inflation brought the exchange rate even lower, and a new coinage was issued consisting of aluminum 500 lei, brass 2,000, and 10,000 lei, and silver 25,000, and 100,000 lei.

===Second leu===

Coins were issued in 1947 after the revaluation in denominations of 50 bani, 1, 2, and 5 lei and depicted the portrait of King Michael I. This coin series was brief, preceded by the king&#x27;s abdication less than a year later and replaced following the establishment of communist administration in Romania in 1948, reissued gradually in denominations of 1, 2, 5, and 20 lei in nickel-brass alloy, and later in aluminum. All second leu coins were discontinued and devalued in late 1952.

===Third leu===

Coins were first issued in 1952 in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, and 50 bani, with aluminum bronze for 1, 3, and 5 bani, and cupronickel for 10, 25, and 50 bani. These coins featured the state arms and name &quot;Republica Populară Romînă&quot;.

In 1960, a new series of coins was issued in denominations of 5, 15, &amp; 25 bani and 1 and 3 lei struck in nickel-plated steel. Starting in 1966, the name on all coins was changed to &quot;Republica Socialistă România&quot; following the ascent of Nicolae Ceaușescu, though all pre-1966 coins of these denominations remained valid. In 1975, the composition of 5 and 15 ban coins was changed to aluminum, and the 25 bani followed suit in 1982. In 1978, an aluminum 5 leu coin was introduced. These denominations remained in use until 1991, particularly the 5 lei, following the lifting of state-mandated exchange rates and price controls.

In 1991, a new coin series with post-communist iconography and new valuations was released in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 lei. These coins gradually lost value with inflation, and a new series was introduced in 1998 with an aluminum-magnesium alloy 500 leu and 1,000 and 5,000 leu coins in 2000.

===Fourth leu===

The coins that are currently in circulation are one ban, made of brass-plated steel; five bani, made of copper-plated steel; ten bani in nickel-plated steel; and fifty bani in nickel brass. These were first introduced into circulation in 2005 with the fourth revaluation and are all currently valid.
There are six 50 bani commemorative circulating coins made in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

The current coins of the Romanian leu are by any objective standards of functional austere design, surpassing in lack of decoration even the plainest Communist-era predecessors.

The one ban coin was rarely seen and not in demand by either banks or many retailers; the &#x27;situation&#x27; has changed and the coin is not uncommonly found (as of 2015). Supermarkets continue habitually to advertise prices such as &quot;9.99&quot; (lei), and frequently price goods to the precise ban such as &quot;9,47&quot;; indeed, as of 2014, very few of the prices displayed at the Carrefour online site (for example) display prices to the nearest 5 or 10 bani. In practice, many retailers round &quot;totals&quot; to the nearest 5 or 10 bani for cash payments, or even whole leu, although (inter)national supermarket chains generally give exact change. For card payments the exact amount (not rounded) is always charged. The reversion to single ban pricing (and change giving) is perhaps due to the (effective) government drive for shops/businesses to give a receipt, an accurate &quot;bon fiscal&quot; (to avoid tax evasion) for every transaction. Official notices must be prominently displayed in all shops/restaurants that an accurate receipt &quot;must&quot; be given.

==Banknotes==
===First leu===
In 1877, state notes were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500 lei. In 1880, these notes were overstamped for issue by the Banca Națională a României, which began to issue regular notes in 1881 in denominations of 20, 100, and 1,000 lei.

In 1914, five leu notes were reintroduced, followed by one and two leu notes in 1915 and 500 lei in 1916. The Ministry of Finance issued very small-sized notes for 10, 25 and 50 bani in 1917. 5,000 lei notes were introduced in 1940, followed by 10,000 and 100,000 lei in 1945 and 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 lei in 1947. In 1945, the Ministry of Finance issued 20 and 100 leu notes to replace those of the National Bank.

===Second leu===
In 1947, the Ministry of Finance introduced 20 lei notes and Banca Națională a României introduced 100, 500 and 1,000 lei notes. In 1949, took over the production of paper money and issued 500 and 1,000 lei notes.

===Third leu===

In 1952, the Ministry of Finance introduced notes for 1, 3, and 5 lei, and the introduced 10, 25 and 100 leu notes. In 1966, the Banca Națională a Republicii Socialiste România took over the production of all paper money, issuing notes for 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 lei.

In 1991, 500 and 1,000 leu notes were introduced, followed by 200 and 5,000 leu notes in 1992, 10,000 lei in 1994, 50,000 lei in 1996, 100,000 lei in 1998, 500,000 lei in 2000 and 1,000,000 lei in 2003. There was also a commemorative 2,000 lei note introduced in 1999 celebrating the total solar eclipse that occurred on 11 August 1999. The final issues of the 2,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 lei were polymer notes.

Notes in circulation at the revaluation were:
* 10,000 lei (became 1 leu)
* 50,000 lei (became )
* 100,000 lei (became )
* 500,000 lei (became )
* 1,000,000 lei (became )

===Fourth series===
In 2005, polymer notes were introduced for 1 leu, 5, 10, 50, 100 and . notes were added in 2006. The designs of the 1 leu, 5, 10, 50, and notes are based on those of the earlier 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 leu notes which they replaced. The note was redesigned in November 2008 (most of the graphic elements are identical, some of the safety elements were changed, making its safety features similar to the lower-valued notes for 1 leu and ). The highest-value coin (in general circulation) is 50 bani (around 15 cents US or 9 pence sterling); the 1 leu note (there is no coin) has, therefore, a value of (approximately) 25 cents US or 18 pence sterling, or around 23 euro cents.

In preparation for Romania joining the Eurozone, banknotes of the fourth leu are of equal size to Euro banknotes.

The banknote was introduced by the National Bank of Romania in November 2021.

<doc id="642268" wikidata="Q572810" url="?curid=642268" title="List of counts and dukes of Limburg">
<text>The counts of Limburg ruled a medieval county with its capital at Limbourg-sur-Vesdre, lying between Liège and Aachen. They rose to prominence when one of them was appointed Duke of Lower Lorraine. Though Lorraine was later confiscated, the ducal title was kept within the family, transferred to the county of Limburg, and this was eventually ratified by the Holy Roman Emperor. Thereafter, the dukes of Limburg were one of several claimant lines of heirs to the title of the old duke of Lower Lorraine. Their title was eventually inherited by their competitors, the dukes of Brabant, and became part of the large collection of titles of the Burgundian Netherlands, eventually passing to the Hapsburgs.

After the occupation in 1794 by the French, the old Austrian Duchy of Limburg was disbanded and the largest part was absorbed into the département of Ourthe (which became the province of Liège). Only a small northern part belonged to the département of Meuse-Inférieure and thus to the later province of Limburg. The title &quot;duke of Limburg&quot; was nevertheless revived after the foundation of the new Duchy of Limburg as a result of the Treaty of London in 1839. According to this treaty the new duchy (without the cities of Maastricht and Venlo), was joined to the German Confederation. After the collapse of this confederation in 1866, Limburg as a duchy ceased to exist and became a province of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

<text>Malaysian Scouts Association, officially known as the Scouts Association of Malaysia (), is the largest informal youth and educational organisation in Malaysia, and member of World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM).

==History==

Scouting in Malaya (now Malaysia) was first introduced in Penang in 1908 as an experimental troop in YMCA before spreading throughout the entire peninsula.

Scouting took roots in 1908 and welcomed Lord Baden-Powell and Lady Olave Baden-Powell during their historical visit in 1934 to Penang, Kuala Kangsar, Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur.

After gaining independence on 31 August 1957, the Boy Scouts International Bureau formally issued membership on 1 September 1957 to the nation&#x27;s Scouting body which took shape as Federation of Malaya Boy Scouts Association and officially established as Persekutuan Kanak-kanak Pengakap Malaysia or Boy Scouts Association of Malaysia and officially regulated by an act of Parliament through The Boy Scouts Association of Malaysia (Incorporation) Act No. 38, 1968.

It took on its current name as Persekutuan Pengakap Malaysia (PPM) or Scouts Association of Malaysia following an act of Parliament; Boy Scouts Association of Malaysia Act No. 143, 1974.

The previous patron of the PPM is the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Abdullah (2019–2024) while the President of PPM is the Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim (since 2022). The current National Chief Scout (Malay: &quot;Ketua Pengakap Negara&quot;) is Major General (R) Prof. Dato&#x27; Dr. Haji Mohd Zin Bidin and National Chief Scout Commissioner (Malay: &quot;Ketua Pesuruhjaya Pengakap Negara&quot;) is Haji Nasaruddin Haji Shamsuddin.

In 1974, Datuk Syed Hashim bin Abdullah was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. Other recipients include Tan Sri Kamarul Ariffin bin Mohd Yassin in 1983.

On 2 May 2023, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was proclaimed the President of the association and conferred the Golden Rice Spirit Star Award (Malay: &quot;Anugerah Bintang Semangat Padi Emas&quot;), the highest award of the association and exclusive award bestowed only on national and state leaders by Acting National Chief Scout and National Chief Scout Commissioner Mohd Zin Bidin. Mohd Zin also hoped the proclamation could take its image to greater heights, strengthen its role and attract more youths at the universities and schools to join it.

==Uniform==

A Junior Scout&#x27;s uniform consists of a short-sleeve (girls wear long sleeves) grey shirt, with two pockets with buttons on the left and right breast, the official neckerchief, the forage cap, navy-blue pants, the official bronze belt, navy-blue socks and black canvas shoes with laces. A miniature Malaysian flag is stitched on the right breast pocket and the Tenderfoot badge (analogous to the same-named first rank in the Boy Scouts of America) stitched on the left one. The neckerchief, with red, white and blue stripes, is worn about the collar, fastened with the official woggle. The forage cap has a badge with the Malaysian Scout emblem on one side.

On the left sleeve are one&#x27;s patrol&#x27;s name and merit badges. On the right sleeve is one&#x27;s state, district, and troop number. The advancement badge is sewn below the troop number when a Junior Scout earns it. Depending on a Junior Scout&#x27;s rank and/or badges, he/she may be allowed to wear a lanyard.

A Senior Scout&#x27;s uniform is the same as the Junior Scout&#x27;s except for the position of badges. The King&#x27;s Scout badge is worn on the left sleeve, five centimetres below the patrol badge. On the left sleeve is one&#x27;s patrol&#x27;s name, and one&#x27;s advancement badges. The Senior Scout&#x27;s have up to five advancement badges. Once taken, the Senior Scout will go on to become a King&#x27;s Scout. The King&#x27;s Scout badge is worn five centimeters below the patrol badge in place of all five Senior Badges.

The only differences between a Leader&#x27;s (Rovers/Scoutmasters) uniform and that of Junior Scouts are the insignia sewn on and the epaulets worn. The Chief Scout and Assistant Scoutmasters don blue epaulets with various symbols, while Rovers wear red epaulets. Each Rover Crew is allowed to create its own crew emblem, which is then stitched on the right arm beneath the Crew Letter. The advancement badges for Rovers are worn on the left breast, below the Rover badge, while the miniature King&#x27;s Scout Badge is worn on the left sleeve.

Colours of epaulette and shoulder patch:
*Red – Rover Scouts
*Grey - staff
*Purple – trainers
*Blue – commissioners
*Green – lay officers
*Maroon – elected officials
*Yellow – royal family

==Badge progression scheme==

The Scout emblem incorporates elements of the coat of arms of Malaysia.

Regardless of which unit one is a member of, one must pass the Tenderfoot (Malay: &quot;Keahlian&quot;) test before being eligible for any other badges. This test examines one on one&#x27;s qualifications to become a Scout, testing one on the Scout uniform, Scout emblems, Scout oath, Scout laws, Scout salute and sign, the history of Scouting, and basic knot-tying, such as tying a reef knot.

For Cub Scouts (Malay: &quot;Pengakap Kanak-Kanak&quot;), one may receive the Bronze Dagger (Malay: &quot;Keris Gangsa&quot;) badge, Silver Dagger (Malay: &quot;Keris Perak&quot;) badge and Gold Dagger (Malay: &quot;Keris Emas&quot;) badge. The dagger (Malay: &quot;Keris&quot;) is a Malay dagger used as an official weapon by the royalty. One must attain all preceding badges before qualifying for the next one. Besides that, one may also receive various merit badges throughout the course of receiving the three dagger (Malay: &quot;Keris&quot;) badges. Someone who has achieved the Gold Dagger (Malay: &quot;Keris Emas&quot;) badge with certain merit badges is entitled to wear the Cub Scout Cord (Malay: &quot;Rambu Pengakap Kanak-Kanak&quot;), which is blue in colour.

For Junior Scout (Malay: &quot;Pengakap Muda&quot;), one may receive the Third Class (Malay: &quot;Usaha&quot;) badge, Second Class (Malay: &quot;Maju&quot;) badge and First Class (Malay: &quot;Jaya&quot;) badge. One must attain all preceding badges before qualifying for the next one. Same as the previous stage, one can also receive a total of eight merit badges; two for hobbies, three for knowledge, and another three for service. Someone who achieves the First Class badge with the eight other merit badges is entitled to wear the Junior Scout Cord (Malay: &quot;Rambu Pengakap Muda&quot;), which is green in colour.

For Senior Scout (Malay: &quot;Pengakap Remaja&quot;), one earns Independence (Malay: &quot;Jaya Diri&quot;) badge, Skills (Malay: &quot;Kemahiran&quot;) badge, Activities (Malay: &quot;Kegiatan&quot;) badge, Expedition (Malay: &quot;Ekspedisi&quot;) badge and Service (Malay: &quot;Perkhidmatan&quot;) badge. These badges are known as the Five Highest Badges (Malay: &quot;Lima Lencana Tertinggi&quot;), and a pre-requisite before being assessed as a King&#x27;s Scout (Malay: &quot;Pengakap Raja&quot;).

==King&#x27;s Scout Award==
The qualified candidate will hand in his/her application form to the district commissioner together with his/her logbooks and certs (of all badges received). He/she will be evaluated and assessed during Pre-King&#x27;s Scout Assessment Camp (Malay: &quot;Kem Ujian Pra-Penarafan Pengakap Raja&quot;), which has these components: Responsibility (Malay: &quot;Tanggungjawab&quot;), Expedition (Malay: &quot;Pengembaraan&quot;), Community Service (Malay: &quot;Perkhidmatan Masyarakat&quot;), Activity (Malay: &quot;Kegiatan&quot;), and Independence (Malay: &quot;Berdikari&quot;). Once a candidate completes and passes the Pre-King&#x27;s Scout Assessment Camp (Malay: &quot;Kem Ujian Pra-Penarafan Pengakap Raja&quot;), he/she is recognised and allowed to wear a royal yellow Senior Scout&#x27;s Cord (Malay: &quot;Rambu Pengakap Remaja&quot;), and therefore has all the requirements ready for King&#x27;s Scout certification.

The candidate then progresses to attend the King&#x27;s Scout Assessment Camp (Malay: &quot;Kem Penarafan Pengakap Raja&quot;), a three-day two-nights organised by his/her respective State King&#x27;s Scout Assessment Council (Malay: &quot;Lembaga Penaraf Pengakap Raja Negeri&quot;). Such an assessment follows the national scheme and involves camping, campcraft, pioneering, first aid, estimation, knots and lashing, map reading, foot and stave drills, backwoods&#x27; man cooking, songs, personal and group interviews, handicraft making and more.

Upon passing all the required tests, the candidate is accorded and allowed to wear a royal yellow coloured Bushman&#x27;s Thong, which is self-made.

After all documentation has been completely vetted at headquarters, the candidate will have earned the yellow, blue and green King&#x27;s Scout Badge (Malay: &quot;Lencana Pengakap Raja&quot;) which is worn on their left sleeve. They will also be invited to the Royal Palace of their respective state and bestowed the prestigious King&#x27;s Scout Certificate (Malay: &quot;Sijil Pengakap Raja&quot;), by the Royal Ruler of that state, representing His Majesty the King of Malaysia, the Patron of the PPM. The certificate is unique as it bears 10 signatures, lead foremost by the current King of Malaysia and the 9 State Rulers. There are, thus far, no other certificates in such a similar manner. If in a non-Royal state, His Majesty&#x27;s signature is present first and foremost.

Junior Scouts who receive the King&#x27;s Scout Certificate and Badge while in their age level are required to pass the Pre-King&#x27;s Scout Assessment Camp (Malay: &quot;Kem Ujian Pra-Penarafan Pengakap Raja&quot;), the King&#x27;s Scout Assessment Camp (Malay: &quot;Kem Penarafan Pengakap Raja&quot;) and all other requirements, if so needed should all the requirements be accomplished. Unlike the Senior Scouts, candidates from this age group carry the Junior Scout Cord.

==Troop organization==
A troop is divided into several patrols, each with its own patrol leader and assistant patrol leader. A committee called the Patrol Leaders&#x27; Council plans all the troop&#x27;s activities, with guidance from the troop&#x27;s Scoutmaster(s). The Patrol Leaders&#x27; Council consists of all the patrol leaders and their assistants. From the Patrol Leaders&#x27; Council, Patrol Leaders are elected to become the Troop Leader, Assistant Troop Leader, Troop Secretary, Troop Treasurer and Troop Quartermaster. This committee is called the Court of Honour (COH) and is the most exclusive committee in a troop. The posts mentioned are the least a troop can have. Besides the above-mentioned posts, other posts such as Discipline Officer, Den warden, Librarian, IT Director, Historian and much more can be added if the need should arise.

A patrol itself, besides its patrol leader and assistant patrol leader, has a secretary for taking down the details of a patrol meeting, has a treasurer for recording the financial matters and has a quartermaster for taking care of the patrol&#x27;s equipment. During camp, the quartermaster becomes the equipment quartermaster, and a food quartermaster is appointed. The secretary becomes assistant patrol leader if the patrol leader or assistant patrol leader does not show up for a meeting.

==B-P House==

The headquarters for Persekutuan Pengakap Malaysia or Scouts Association of Malaysia is Rumah B-P or B-P House. It is located in Kuala Lumpur at 4 Jalan Hang Jebat (formerly Davidson Road), 50150 Kuala Lumpur.

The foundation was laid on May 16, 1954 by Pengakap Agong Persekutuan Tanah Melayu or Federated Malay States Chief Scout Commissioner General Sir Gerald Walter Robert Templer KG, GCB, GCMG, KBE, DSO, who was then the British High Commissioner of Malaya prior to his departure on May 31, 1954. B-P House was constructed at a cost of RM150,000 and took three years to complete. It was formally officiated by His Excellency Sir Donald Macgillivray KCMG, MBE, Pengakap Agung Persekutuan Tanah Melayu or Federated Malay States Chief Scout Commissioner on January 5, 1957 to commemorate the 100th birth year of Lord Baden-Powell (February 22, 1857) and also 50th anniversary of world Scouting (1907 - 1957).

The 4-storey building has recently undergone a major renovation with a large hall on the left wing, a museum on the right wing, a Scout shop with its own separate entrance on the ground floor, the National Chief Scout, National Chief Scout Commissioner and administration offices on the 1st floor, hostels on the 3rd and 4th floor.

It is about 12 minutes by car to World Scout Bureau - Global Support Centre Kuala Lumpur, within walking distance to the iconic Petaling Street, Pasar Seni or Central Market and PUTRA-LRT station.

The Scout headquarters serves as a national centre for administration for Scout matters. It currently has a paid staff of 9. Meetings and leadership courses are held there.

==Gilwell Scouts Nature Park Sandakan==

Persekutuan Pengakap Malaysia proposed the idea of Gilwell Scouts Nature Park Sandakan (Gilwell SNP Sandakan) applying to be part of World Organization of the Scout Movement&#x27;s Scout Centre of Excellence for Nature, Environment and Sustainability or SCENES on April 10, 2019. This proposal was endorsed on August 4, 2019. The 12 acre Gilwell SNP Sandakan is owned and operated by Persekutuan Pengakap Malaysia Cawangan Sabah (PPMCS), one of 17 members in the federation of Scouting in Malaysia. The application and all pertaining information was authored and submitted in March 2020 to World Scout Bureau Global Support Centre Kuala Lumpur. The World Scout Bureau approved Gilwell SNP Sandakan for official accreditation as a SCENES centre on May 12, 2020 after approvals from PPM, Asia-Pacific Region and WOSM.
This is a historic milestone with Gilwell SNP Sandakan as the first SCENES in Malaysia and the third in Asia Pacific, after Hong Kong and Taiwan.

* Persatuan Pandu Puteri Malaysia, member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts
* Persekutuan Pengakap Malaysia, member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement

==International Scouting units in Malaysia==
In addition, there is an international troop of Scouts in Kuala Lumpur, linked to the Direct Service branch of the Boy Scouts of America, which supports units around the world.

==History==
Scouting in Malaya (now Malaysia) was first introduced in Penang in 1908 as an experimental troop in YMCA before spreading throughout the entire peninsula.

Some local Scout troops registered with The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom which established a local branch, the Boy Scouts Association Malaya &amp; Straits Settlement Branch which became defunct in 1957 when Persekutuan Budak-Budak Pengakap Malaysia (Federation of Malaya Boy Scouts Association) was formed. Persekutuan Budak-Budak Pengakap Malaysia was renamed the Persekutuan Pengakap Malaysia (Scouts Association of Malaysia).

<doc id="642276" wikidata="Q1141000" url="?curid=642276" title="Châteaux of the Loire Valley">
<text>The châteaux of the Loire Valley () are part of the architectural heritage of the historic towns of Amboise, Angers, Blois, Chinon, Montsoreau, Orléans, Saumur, and Tours along the river Loire in France. They illustrate Renaissance ideals of design in France.

The châteaux of the Loire Valley number over three hundred, ranging from practical fortified castles from the 10th century to splendid residences built half a millennium later. When the French kings began constructing their huge châteaux in the Loire Valley, the nobility, drawn to the seat of power, followed suit, attracting the finest architects and landscape designers. The châteaux and their surrounding gardens are cultural monuments which embody the ideals of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Many of the châteaux were built on hilltops, such as the Château d&#x27;Amboise, while the only one built in the riverbed is the Château de Montsoreau. Many had exquisite churches on the grounds or within the château.

==History==
With the Hundred Years&#x27; War concluded, Charles VII, Louis XI, and their successors preferred to spend the bulk of their time in the &quot;garden of France&quot; along the banks of the Loire. In the late 15th century Tours, then Blois, and later Amboise became the preferred locations of the French royal court. Many courtiers bought dilapidated castles built by the medieval Counts of Blois and of Anjou, and they had them reconstructed in the latest Italianate fashion. Leonardo da Vinci and other Italian artists arrived to design and beautify these residences.

In the 16th century, Francis I moved his main residence back to the Louvre, in Paris. With him went the great architects, but the Loire Valley continued to be the place where French royalty preferred to spend their time when not in the capital. Toward the end of the 17th century, Louis XIV made the Île-de-France the permanent locale for great royal residences when he built the Palace of Versailles. Nonetheless, those who gained the king&#x27;s favour, as well as the wealthy bourgeoisie, continued to renovate existing châteaux or build lavish new ones in the Loire Valley as summer residences.

The French Revolution saw a number of the great châteaux destroyed and many ransacked, their treasures stolen. The overnight impoverishment of many French noble families, usually after one of their members lost his or her head to the guillotine, saw many châteaux demolished. During World War I and World War II, various chateaux were commandeered as military headquarters. Some of these continued to be so used after the end of World War II.

Today, the remaining privately owned châteaux serve as homes and some of them open their doors to tourists, while others operate as hotels or bed-and-breakfasts. Many others have been taken over by local governments, and the grandest, like those at Chambord, are owned and operated by the national government and are major tourist sites, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.

== List of châteaux of the Loire ==
Though there may be no universally accepted definition for the designation, the main criterion is that the château must be situated close to the Loire or one of its tributaries (such as the Maine, Cher, Indre, Creuse or Loir). Châteaux further upstream than Gien are generally not included, with the possible exception of the Bastie d&#x27;Urfé for its historical significance.

<text>Szymon Askenazy (December 24, 1865, Zawichost – June 22, 1935, Warsaw) was a Jewish-Polish historian, educator, statesman and diplomat, founder of the Askenazy school.

He was the first Polish representative at the League of Nations. His work as a historian was influential in defining the creation and history of the Polish nation.

== Biography ==
Persuaded by his father, Askenazy studied law at the Imperial University of Warsaw in the 1880s. After graduation, he worked as a lawyer; however, all the spare time he devoted to reading books in various languages. In April 1893, he went to Göttingen to study history. He was influenced by the professor of medieval and modern history Max Lehmann under whose supervision he wrote doctoral dissertation &quot;Die letzte Polnische Koenigswahl&quot; (1894).

Commencing in 1902, he served as a professor at the University of Lwów till November 1919. In 1909 he was inducted into the Polish Academy of Learning(&quot;Polska Akademia Umiejętności&quot;). One of his main books &quot;Gdańsk a Polska&quot; was published in 1919 and translated into English (&quot;Danzig &amp; Poland&quot;, 1921), French (&quot;Dantzig et la Pologne&quot;, 1919) and German (&quot;Danzig und Polen&quot;, 1919). Askenazy planned to join Warsaw University, however on his way there stood Bronisław Dembiński and Marceli Handelsman, who blocked his nomination to become a professor of this university. Famous Poles supported Askenazy: Stefan Żeromski, Zofia Nałkowska, Karol Szymanowski, Leopold Staff, Andrzej Strug, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, Antoni Słonimski, Wacław Sieroszewski who signed an appeal (published in &quot;Robotnik&quot;, 2 March 1920) for a place for Askenazy at Warsaw University, however in vain.

After Poland regained independence, Askenazy was chosen to be the first Polish representative at the League of Nations (1920–23). His candidacy for this post was supported by Józef Piłsudski and nomination was signed by the Foreign Minister of Poland, Eustachy Sapieha in May 1920. He cooperated later with other Polish Foreign Ministers: Konstanty Skirmunt, Gabriel Narutowicz and Aleksander Skrzyński. In May 1923, Marian Seyda from, the Popular National Union (a Polish political party of the National Democracy political camp) became the Foreign Minister of Poland after Lanckorona Pact agreement was introduced. Askenazy saw this as a sign to step down. He resigned from the post and in July 1923 came back to Poland. Askenazy never joined any political party.

In his studies, he focused chiefly on Poland&#x27;s political and economic history in the 18th and 19th centuries. He thus laid the foundations for the Lwów-Warsaw School of History (also known as the &quot;Askenazy school&quot;). He was the first historian to emphasize the Partitions period as crucially important to the creation of the modern Polish nation. 

Askenazy&#x27;s idea of describing a nation&#x27;s history through its social and economic development, as well as its international and diplomatic backdrop, remains influential in modern Polish historical studies. 

William J. Rose, an English translator of Askenazy&#x27;s book &quot;Danzig &amp; Poland&quot;&quot;,&quot; wrote in the obituary published in The Slavonic and East European Review that with the death of Professor Askenazy &quot;Polish learning lost one of its most distinguished ornaments&quot;.

<text>The Medicine Bar was a bar in Birmingham, England. Located in the Custard Factory in Digbeth, it has hosted many techno, acid jazz, funk and hip hop events. It started as a collaboration in the 1990s between the London Medicine bar and local hip hop DJ &#x27;Simon Fat Head&#x27;, who began his career at the Brothers and Sisters at the Coast to Coast club on Broad Street. It ceased to trade by 2012.

&quot;Substance&quot; (which evolved out of &quot;Amplified&quot;) is the longest running hip hop night in the bar, with DJs Roc1, Magoo, Chris Reid (also from Scratch in London) and MC Mad Flow. It has brought hip hop acts including Afrika Bambaata, De La Soul and Jeru the Damaja to Birmingham.

&quot;Leftfoot&quot; is the bar&#x27;s main funk and soul night which is part run by ex Rockers Hi-Fi DJ Dick and Adam Regan (who now owns the Bull&#x27;s Head bar in the birmingham suburb of Moseley). Leftfoot hosts many large acid Jazz type events with appearances from Gilles Peterson to Mr Scruff. Both nights feature live acts.

Other events to take place at the bar include breakdance and graffiti art shows. For a short period in 2006/07, the Medicine Bar hosted the Birmingham leg of Club NME.

Medicine Bar had a Martin Audio modular system installed by Ace Vintage Systems.

<text>Diyarbakır (; , local pronunciation: &quot;Dikranagerd&quot;; ; ), formerly Diyarbekir, is the largest Kurdish-majority city in Turkey. It is the administrative center of Diyarbakır Province.

Situated around a high plateau by the banks of the Tigris river on which stands the historic Diyarbakır Fortress, it is the administrative capital of the Diyarbakır Province of southeastern Turkey. It is the second-largest city in the Southeastern Anatolia Region. As of December 2021, the Metropolitan Province population was 1,791,373 of whom 1,129,218 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 4 urban districts (Bağlar, Kayapınar, Sur and Yenişehir).

Diyarbakır has been a main focal point of the conflict between the Turkish state and various Kurdish separatist groups, and is seen by many Kurds as the de facto capital of Kurdistan. The city was intended to become the capital of an independent Kurdistan following the Treaty of Sèvres, but this was disregarded following subsequent political developments.

On 6 February 2023 Diyarbakır was affected by the twin Turkey-Syria earthquakes, which inflicted some damage on its city walls.

== Names and etymology ==
In ancient times the city was known as Amida, a name which could derive from an older Assyrian toponym &quot;Amedi&quot;. The name &quot;Āmid&quot; was also used in Arabic. The name &quot;Amit&quot; is found in official documents of the Empire of Trebizond from 1358.

After the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the city became known as &quot;Diyar Bakr&quot; (), in reference to the territory of the Banu Bakr tribe, the &quot;Diyar Bakr&quot;. That tribe had already settled in northern Mesopotomia during the pre-Islamic period. In the 7th century, during the caliphate of Uthman and under the regional governorship of Mu&#x27;awiya, a portion of the tribe was ordered to settle further north in the lands near the city. The city was later also known in Turkish as Kara-Amid (&quot;Black Amid&quot;), on account of its black basalt walls.

In November 1937, Turkish President Atatürk visited the city and after expressing uncertainty on the exact etymology of the city&#x27;s name, &quot;Diyarbekir&quot;, in December of the same year ordered that it be renamed &quot;Diyarbakır&quot;, which means &quot;land of copper&quot; in Turkish after the abundant resources of copper around the city. This was one of the early examples of the Turkification process of non-Turkish place names, in which non-Turkish (Greek, Kurdish, Armenian, Arabic and other) geographical names were changed to Turkish alternatives.

The Armenian name of the city is &quot;Tigranakert/Dikranagerd&quot; (). It is known as in Kurdish and in Syriac as (Āmīd).

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

People have inhabited the area around Diyarbakır since the Stone Age. The first major civilization to establish itself in the region of Diyarbakır was the Hurrian kingdom of the Mitanni. It was then ruled by a succession of nearly every polity that controlled Upper Mesopotamia, including the Arameans, Assyrians, Urartu, Armenians, Achaemenid Persians, Medes, Seleucids, and Parthians. The Roman Republic gained control of the city in 66 BC, by which stage it was named &quot;Amida&quot;. In 359, Shapur II of Persia captured Amida after a siege of 73 days.

According to the &quot;Synecdemus&quot; of Hierocles, as Amida, Diyarbakır was the major city of the Roman province of Mesopotamia. It was the episcopal see of the Christian diocese of Mesopotamia. Ancient texts record that ancient Amida had an amphitheatre, &quot;thermae&quot; (public baths), warehouses, a tetrapylon monument, and Roman aqueducts supplying and distributing water. The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus was serving in the late Roman army during the Siege of Amida by the Sasanian Empire under Shapur II (), and described the successful siege in detail. Amida was then enlarged by refugees from ancient Nisibis (Nusaybin), which the emperor Jovian () was forced to evacuate and cede to Shapur&#x27;s Persians after the defeat of his predecessor Julian&#x27;s Persian War, becoming the main Roman stronghold in the region. The chronicle attributed to Joshua the Stylite describes the capture of Amida by the Persians under Kavad I () in the second Siege of Amida in 502–503, part of the Anastasian War.

Either the emperor Anastasius Dicorus () or the emperor Justinian the Great () rebuilt the walls of Amida, a feat of defensive architecture praised by the Greek historian Procopius. As recorded by the works of John of Ephesus, Zacharias Rhetor, and Procopius, the Romans and Persians continued to contest the area, and in the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 Amida was captured and held by the Persians for twenty-six years, being recovered in 628 for the Romans by the emperor Heraclius (), who also founded a church in the city on his return to Constantinople (Istanbul) from Persia the following year.

=== Ecclesiastical history ===

Syriac Christianity took hold in the region between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, particularly amongst the Assyrians of the city. The Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II (408–450) divided the Roman province of Mesopotamia into two, and made Amida the capital of Mesopotamia Prima, and thereby also the metropolitan see for all the province&#x27;s bishoprics.

At some stage, Amida became a see of the Armenian Church. The bishops who held the see in 1650 and 1681 were in full communion with the Holy See, and in 1727 Peter Derboghossian sent his profession of faith to Rome. He was succeeded by two more bishops of the Armenian Catholic Church, Eugenius and Ioannes of Smyrna, the latter of whom died in Constantinople in 1785. After a long vacancy, three more bishops followed. The diocese had some 5,000 Armenian Catholics in 1903, but it lost most of its population in the 1915 Armenian genocide. The last diocesan bishop of the see, Andreas Elias Celebian, was killed with some 600 of his flock in the summer of 1915.

An eparchy for the local members of the Syriac Catholic Church was established in 1862. Persecution of Christians in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War brought an end to the existence of both these Syrian residential sees.

=== Middle Ages ===
In 639, as part of the Muslim conquest of the Levant during the early Arab–Byzantine wars, Amida fell to the armies of the Rashidun Caliphate led by Iyad ibn Ghanm, and the Great Mosque of Amida was constructed afterwards in the city&#x27;s centre, possibly on the site of the Heraclian Church of Saint Thomas. There were as many as five Christian monasteries in the city, including the Zuqnin Monastery and several ancient churches mentioned by John of Ephesus. One of these, the Church of the Virgin Mary, remains the city&#x27;s cathedral and the see of the bishop of Diyarbakır in the Syriac Orthodox Church. Another ancient church, the Church of Mar Cosmas, was seen by the British explorer Gertrude Bell in 1911 but was destroyed in 1930, while the former Church of Saint George, in the walled citadel, may originally have been built for Muslim use or for the Church of the East.

The city was part of the Umayyad Caliphate and then the Abbasid Caliphate, but then came under more local rule until its recovery in 899 by forces loyal to the caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid () before falling under the sway of first the Hamdanid dynasty and then the Buyid dynasty, followed by a period of control by the Marwanids. The city was taken by the Seljuks in 1085 and by the Ayyubids in 1183. Ayyubid control lasted until the Mongol invasions of Anatolia, with its last Ayyubid ruler Al-Kamil Muhammad. The Mongols of Hulagu captured of the city in 1260 (Siege of Mayyāfāriqīn), following a long siege with a small Mongol force and a much larger Georgian and Armenian force under the Georgian leader Hasan Brosh. Between the Mongol occupation and conquest by the Safavid dynasty of Iran, the Kara Koyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu – two Turkoman confederations – were in control of the city in succession. Diyarbakır was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1514 by Bıyıklı Mehmed Pasha, in the reign of the sultan Selim I (). Mohammad Khan Ustajlu, the Safavid governor of Diyarbakir, was evicted from the city and killed in the following Battle of Chaldiran in 1514.

=== Safavids and Ottomans ===
The Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire saw it expand into Western Armenia and all but the eastern regions of Kurdistan at the expense of the Safavids. From the early 16th century, the city and the wider region was the source of intrigue between the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire, both of whom sought the support of the Kurdish chieftains around Idris Bitlisi. It was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1514 in the campaigns of Bıyıklı Mehmed Pasha, under the rule of Sultan Selim I. Mohammad Khan Ustajlu, the Safavid Governor of Diyarbakir, was evicted from the city and killed in the following Battle of Chaldiran in 1514.

Following their victory, the Ottomans established the Diyarbekir Eyalet with its administrative centre in Diyarbakır. The Eyalet of Diyarbakır corresponded to today&#x27;s Turkish Kurdistan, a rectangular area between the Lake Urmia to Palu and from the southern shores of Lake Van to Cizre and the beginnings of the Syrian Desert, although its borders saw some changes over time. The city was an important military base for controlling the region and at the same time a thriving city noted for its craftsmen, producing glass and metalwork. For example, the doors of Rumi&#x27;s tomb in Konya were made in Diyarbakır, as were the gold and silver decorated doors of the tomb of Ebu Hanife in Baghdad. Ottoman rule was confirmed by the 1555 Peace of Amasya which followed the Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–1555).
Concerned with independent-mindedness of the Kurdish principalities, the Ottomans sought to curb their influence and bring them under the control of the central government in Constantinople. However, removal from power of these hereditary principalities led to more instability in the region from the 1840s onwards. In their place, sufi sheiks and religious orders rose to prominence and spread their influence throughout the region. One of the prominent Sufi leaders was &quot;Shaikh Ubaidalla Nahri&quot;, who began a revolt in the region between Lakes Van and Urmia. The area under his control covered both Ottoman and Qajar territories. Shaikh Ubaidalla is regarded as one of the earliest proponents of Kurdish nationalism. In a letter to a British Vice-Consul, he declared: &quot;The Kurdish nation is a people apart... we want our affairs to be in our hands.&quot;
In 1895 an estimated 25,000 Armenians and Assyrians were massacred in Diyarbekir Vilayet, including in the city. At the turn of the 19th century, the Christian population of the city was mainly made up of Armenians and Syriac Orthodox Christians. The city was also a site of ethnic cleansing during the 1915 Armenian and Assyrian genocide (see: 1915 genocide in Diyarbekir); nearly 150,000 were expelled from the city to the death marches in the Syrian Desert.

=== Republic of Turkey ===
In January 1928, Diyarbakır became the center of the First Inspectorate-General, a regional subdivision for an area containing the provinces of Hakkari, Van, Şırnak, Mardin, Siirt, Bitlis and Şanlıurfa. In a reorganization of the provinces in 1952, Diyarbakır city was made the administrative capital of the Diyarbakır Province. In 1993, Diyarbakir was established as a Metropolitan Municipality. Its districts are Bağlar, Bismil, Ergani, Hazro, Kayapinar, Çermik, Çinar, Eğil, Dicle, Kulp, Kocaköy, Lice, Silvan, Sur, Yenişehir, Hani and Çüngüş.

The American-Turkish Pirinçlik Air Force Base near Diyarbakır was operational from 1956 to 1997.

Diyarbakır has seen much violence in recent years, involving Turkish security forces, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Between 8 November 2015 and 15 May 2016 large parts of Sur were destroyed in fighting between the Turkish military and the PKK. In early November 2015, Kurdish lawyer and human rights activist Tahir Elçi was killed in the Sur district during a press statement in which he had been calling for a de-escalation in violence between the PKK and the Turkish state.
A 2018 report by Arkeologlar Derneği İstanbul found that, since 2015, 72% of the city&#x27;s historic Sur district had been destroyed through demolition and redevelopment, and that laws designed to protect historic monuments had been ignored. They found that the city&#x27;s &quot;urban regeneration&quot; policy was one of demolition and redevelopment rather than one of repairing cultural assets damaged during the recent civil conflict, and because of that many registered historic buildings had been completely destroyed. The extent of the loss of non-registered historic structures is unknown because any historic building fragments revealed during the demolition of modern structures were also demolished. As of 2021, large parts of the city and district were restored and government officials were looking towards tourism again.

Many residences and buildings collapsed or suffered substantial damage in the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes around 200 miles (300 km) from the epicentre. A Turkish professor and former journalist from the country commented, &quot;It is like having an epicenter of an earthquake in Harrisburg and buildings in New York City are collapsing.&quot;

== Sports ==
The most notable football clubs of the city are Diyarbakırspor (established 1968) and Amed S.F.K. (established 1990), with Deniz Naki being one of the most notable footballers from the city. The women&#x27;s football team Amed S.K. were promoted at the end of the 2016–17 Turkish Women&#x27;s Second Football League season to the Women&#x27;s First League.

== Politics ==
In the 2014 local elections, Gültan Kışanak and Fırat Anlı of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) were elected co-mayors of Diyarbakır. However, on 25 October 2016, both were detained by Turkish authorities &quot;on thinly supported charges of being a member of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)&quot;. The Turkish government ordered a general internet blackout after the arrest. Nevertheless, on 26 October, several thousand demonstrators at Diyarbakir city hall demanded the mayors&#x27; release. Some days later, the Turkish government appointed an unelected state trustee as the mayor. In November, public prosecutors demanded a 230-year prison sentence for Kışanak.

In January 2017, the un-elected state trustee appointed by the Turkish government ordered the removal of the Assyrian sculpture of a mythological winged bull from the town hall, which had been erected by the BDP mayors to commemorate the Assyrian history of the town and its still resident Assyrian minority. All Kurdish language street signs were also removed, alongside the shutting down of organisations concerned with Kurdish language and culture, removal of Kurdish names from public parks, and removal of Kurdish cultural monuments and linguistic symbols.

In the 2019 municipal elections, Adnan Selçuk Mızraklı of the HDP party was elected mayor of Diyarbakir. In August 2019 he was dismissed and subsequently sentenced to 9 years and 4 months imprisonment accused of supporting terrorism as part of a government crackdown against politicians of the Kurdish HDP party; the Turkish state appointed Münir Karaloğlu in his place. Other Kurdish mayors in Kurdish cities across the region also suffered a similar fate, with Turkish President Erdoğan vowing to remove any future Kurdish mayors too. Protests against the decision arose which were suppressed by the Turkish police with the use of water cannons; some protestors were killed. Diyarbakır&#x27;s prison has become home to many political prisoners, mainly Kurdish activists and politicians accused of terrorism charges by the Turkish state. Inmates have been subject to torture, rape, humiliation, beating, murder and other abuses.

== Economy ==
Historically, Diyarbakır produced wheat and sesame. They would preserve the wheat in warehouses, with coverings of straw and twigs from licorice trees. This system would allow the wheat to be preserved for up to ten years. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Diyarbakır exported raisins, almonds, and apricots to Europe. Angora goats were raised, and wool and mohair was exported from Diyarbakır. Merchants would also come from Egypt, Istanbul, and Syria, to purchase goats and sheep. Honey was also produced, but not so much exported, but used by locals. Sericulture was observed in the area, too.

Prior to World War I, Diyarbakır had an active copper industry, with six mines. Three were active, with two being owned by locals and the third being owned by the Turkish government. Tenorite was the primary type of copper mined. It was mined by hand by Kurds. A large portion of the ore was exported to England. The region also produced iron, gypsum, coal, chalk, lime, jet, and quartz, but primarily for local use.

The city is served by Diyarbakır Airport and Diyarbakır railway station. In 1935 the railway between Elazığ and Diyarbakır was inaugurated.

== Demographics ==

At the turn of the 19th century, the Christian population of the city was mainly made up of Armenians and Assyrians. The Assyrian and Armenian presence dates to antiquity. There was also a small Jewish community in the city. All Christians spoke Armenian and Kurdish. Notables spoke Turkish. In the streets, the language was Kurdish. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; from 1911, the population numbered 38 thousand, almost half being Christian and consisting of &quot;Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans, Armenians, Chaldeans, Jacobites, and a few Greeks&quot;. During the Governorship of Mehmed Reshid in the Vilayet of Diyarbakır, the Armenian population of Diyarbakir was resettled and exterminated.

After World War II, as the Kurdish population moved from the villages and mountains to urban centres, Diyarbakir&#x27;s Kurdish population continued to grow. Diyarbakır grew from a population of 30,000 in the 1930s to 65,000 by 1956, to 140,000 by 1970, to 400,000 by 1990, and eventually swelled to about 1.5 million by 1997. During the 1990s, the city grew dramatically due to the immigrant population from thousands of Kurdish villages depopulated by Turkey during the Kurdish–Turkish conflict.

According to a November 2006 survey by the Sûr Municipality, 72% of the inhabitants of the municipality use Kurdish most often in their daily speech due to the overwhelming Kurdish majority in the city, followed by minorities of Assyrian, Armenian and Turkish.

There are some Alevi Turkmen villages around Diyarbakır&#x27;s old city, but there are no official reports about their population numbers.

There have been attempts by Turkish lawmakers to deny Diyarbakır&#x27;s Kurdish majority identity, with Turkey&#x27;s Education Ministry releasing a school book named &quot;Our City, Diyarbakir&quot; (&quot;Şehrimiz Diyarbakır&quot; in Turkish) on Diyarbakir Province in which it claims that a Turkish similar to that spoken in Baku is spoken in the city along with regional languages like Arabic, Persian, Kurdish, Turkmen and Caucasian languages. Critics link this to a general trend towards anti-Kurdish sentiment in Turkey.

== Culture ==
There is local jewelry making and other craftwork in the area. Folk dancing to the drum and zurna (pipe) are a part of weddings and celebrations in the area. The Diyarbakir Municipality Theatre was founded in 1990, and had to close its doors in 1995. It was re-opened in 1999, under Mayor Osman Baydemir. It was closed down in 2016 after the dismissal of the mayor in 2016. The Municipality City Theatre also performed plays in the Kurdish language. 

One of the other common celebrations in Turkey is Nowruz. This celebration is done on the pretext of the beginning of spring and the beginning of the new year. The establishment of Nowruz has a long history, so much so that it has been celebrated in different parts of Asia for the past three thousand years, especially in the Middle East. In different parts of Turkey, especially the Kurdish regions of this country, Nowruz is considered one of the most important cultural and historical traditions of these regions. Lighting a fire, wearing new clothes, holding a dance ceremony, and giving gifts to each other are some of the activities that are done in this celebration.

=== Cuisine ===
Diyarbakır&#x27;s cuisine includes lamb dishes which use spices such as black pepper, sumac and coriander; rice, bulgur and butter. Local dishes include Meftune, lamb meat and vegetables with garlic and sumac, and Kaburga Dolması, baked lamb&#x27;s ribs stuffed with rice, almonds and spices. Watermelons are grown locally and there is an annual Watermelon Festival.

== Main sights ==

The core of Diyarbakır is surrounded by an almost intact set of high walls of black basalt forming a circle around the old city. There are four gates into the old city and 82 watch-towers on the walls, which were built in antiquity and restored and extended by the Roman emperor Constantius II in 349. The area inside the walls is known as the Sur district; before its recent demolition and redevelopment this district had 599 registered historical buildings. Nearby is Karaca Dağ.

Diyarbakır has a Mediterranean (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) or an anomalously warm, hot-summer oceanic climate (Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Doa&quot;). Summers are very hot and very dry, due to its location on the Mesopotamian plain which is subject to hot air masses from the deserts of Syria and Iraq to the south. The highest recorded temperature was 46.2 °C (112.64 °F) on 21 July 1937. Winters are chilly with moderate precipitation and frosty nights.

<text>The Ahaura River is in the South Island of New Zealand. This river drains the western flanks of the Southern Alps and flows into the Grey River.

The Ahaura and its many tributaries rise in the Lake Sumner State Forest park and enters the Grey River at the small settlement of Ahaura approximately 30 km upstream from Greymouth. It drains a huge area of land and in its lower reaches below the Haupiri confluence can have a tea-colour stain for much of the year. The reaches above the junction with the Haupiri tend to have very clear water however for much of the year.

Other rivers in the catchment are the Nancy, Trent, Tūtaekurī and Waiheke Rivers. They can all be kayaked, except in late summer and they are the most used rivers on the West Coast. The lower gorge has remnants of Chinese miners&#x27; gold diggings. Pack-tracks to Canterbury used to go through Amuri Pass into the Doubtful River Valley and by the Tūtaekurī to the Hope River. The Ahaura in the gorge is a wide, fast, shallow, braided river, with extensive grassy flats, surrounded by beech forest. Earthquake Rapid, is the largest rapid on the river. A 1981 survey described the scenic and recreational values of the gorge as exceptional.

The river is only bridged by the Stillwater–Ngākawau Line and SH7. A punt operated across the river from 1871 to 1879, when it was replaced by a bridge. The first railway bridge opened in 1890.

At the gorge the Ahaura&#x27;s 7-day mean annual low flow is per second, the mean flow and the maximum recorded flow . On 26 December 1957 the flood gauge at the SH7 bridge reached . The river&#x27;s catchment is .

Gold digging started about 1865 and a small settlement of shanties had been built at Ahauru by January 1866. 3,300 were reported to be at work in the area by March 1866 and a bridle path had been formed.

The Ahaura Terraces and Nancys Clearing Ecological Areas were declared in 1997 to protect kahikatea and red beech (tawhai raunui) forests on the river&#x27;s terraces, including kākāriki parakeets.

<text>The Ahuriri River is a river in the Canterbury and Otago Regions of the South Island of New Zealand.

The headwaters are on the eastern flanks of the Southern Alps. The river flows for through the southernmost part of the Mackenzie Basin before reaching the Ahuriri Arm of Lake Benmore, one of the lakes in the Waitaki hydroelectric project. From there, the waters join with those of the Waitaki, which has its outflow in the Pacific Ocean.

Much of the upper portion of the river is in the Ahuriri Conservation Park, and it is a well-regarded fly fishing river, supporting both brown and rainbow trout.

A notable rock formation, the Omarama or Ahuriri River Clay Cliffs, is located close to the river&#x27;s north bank some west of the township of Omarama. Omarama is the main settlement close to the river.

<text>The Askenazy school (Polish: &quot;Szkoła Askenazego&quot;, sometimes referred to as Lwów–Warsaw School of History, &quot;Lwowsko-warszawska szkoła historyczna&quot;) was an informal group of Polish historians formed in the early 20th century under the influence of Szymon Askenazy in the University of Lwów and Warsaw University. 

In the 19th century, most history studies in Poland were focused mainly on the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The dominant trend among most conservative historians was to argue that the modern history of Poland was nothing but a history of ill-fated uprisings; the history was thus ignored in their studies.

The Askenazy school was the first to underline the importance of recent history in the creation of the modern nation in Poland. It also focused on the history of international diplomatic relations and economic development of Poland. 

The historians grouped in this movement were the first to lay foundations for the modern study of the history of the Duchy of Warsaw and Congress Poland.

<text>Aviation fuels are petroleum-based fuels, or petroleum and synthetic fuel blends, used to power aircraft. They have more stringent requirements than fuels used for ground use, such as heating and road transport, and contain additives to enhance or maintain properties important to fuel performance or handling. They are kerosene-based (JP-8 and Jet A-1) for gas-turbine–powered aircraft. Piston-engined aircraft use leaded gasoline and those with diesel engines may use jet fuel (kerosene). By 2012, all aircraft operated by the U.S. Air Force had been certified to use a 50–50 blend of kerosene and synthetic fuel derived from coal or natural gas as a way of stabilizing the cost of fuel.

==Types of aviation fuel==

=== Conventional aviation fuels===

==== Jet fuel ====

Jet fuel is a clear to straw-colored fuel, based on either an unleaded kerosene (Jet A-1), or a naphtha–kerosene blend (Jet B). Similar to diesel fuel, it can be used in either compression ignition engines or turbine engines.

Jet-A powers modern commercial airliners and is a mix of extremely refined kerosene and burns at temperatures at or above . Kerosene-based fuel has a much higher flash point than gasoline-based fuel, meaning that it requires significantly higher temperature to ignite. It is a high-quality fuel; if it fails the purity and other quality tests for use on jet aircraft, it is sold to ground-based users with less demanding requirements, such as railroads.

==== Avgas ====

Avgas (aviation gasoline), or aviation spirit, is used by small aircraft, light helicopters and vintage piston-engined aircraft. Its formulation is distinct from the conventional gasoline (UK: petrol) used in motor vehicles, which is commonly called &quot;mogas&quot; or &quot;autogas&quot; in aviation context. Although it comes in many different grades, its octane ratings are generally well higher than those of road motor gasoline.

=== Emerging aviation fuels ===

==== Biofuels ====
Alternatives to conventional fossil-based aviation fuels, new fuels made via the biomass to liquid method (like sustainable aviation fuel) and certain straight vegetable oils can also be used.

Fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel have the advantage that few or no modifications are necessary on the aircraft itself, provided that the fuel characteristics meet specifications for lubricity and density as well as adequately swelling elastomer seals in current aircraft fuel systems. Sustainable aviation fuel and blends of fossil and sustainably-sourced alternative fuels yield lower emissions of particles and GHGs. They are, however, not being used heavily, because they still face political, technological, and economic barriers, such as currently being more expensive than conventionally produced aviation fuels by a wide margin.

==== Compressed natural gas and liquified natural gas ====

Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG) are fuel feedstocks that aircraft may use in the future. Studies have been done on the feasibility of using natural gas and include the &quot;SUGAR Freeze&quot; aircraft under NASA&#x27;s N+4 Advanced Concept Development program (made by Boeing&#x27;s Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) team). The Tupolev Tu-155 was an alternative fuel testbed which was fuelled on LNG. The low specific energy of natural gas even in liquid form compared to conventional fuels gives it a distinct disadvantage for flight applications.

==== Liquid hydrogen ====

Hydrogen can be used largely free of carbon emissions, if it is produced with power from renewable energy like wind and solar power.

Some development of technology for hydrogen-powered aircraft started after the millennium and gained track since about 2020, but as of 2022 was still far away from outright aircraft product development.

Hydrogen fuel cells do not produce or other emissions (besides water). However, hydrogen combustion does produce emissions. Cryogenic hydrogen can be used as a liquid at temperatures below 20 K. Gaseous hydrogen involves pressurized tanks at 250–350 bar. With materials available in the 2020s, the mass of tanks strong enough to withstand this kind of high pressure will greatly outweigh the hydrogen fuel itself, largely negating the weight to energy advantage of hydrogen fuel over hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrogen has a severe volumetric disadvantage relative to hydrocarbon fuels, but future blended wing body aircraft designs might be able to accommodate this extra volume without greatly expanding the wetted area.

Even if finally practical, the industry timeline for adopting hydrogen is fairly lengthy. Alternatives to conventional aviation fuel available in the near term include aviation biofuel and synthetically created fuel (aka &quot;e-jet&quot;). These fuels are collectively referred to as &quot;Sustainable Aviation Fuel&quot; (SAF).

==Production of aviation fuel==
The production of aviation fuel falls into two categories: fuel suitable for turbine engines and fuel suitable for spark-ignition piston engines. There are international specifications for each.

Jet fuel is a gas turbine fuel used in propeller and jet fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. It has a low viscosity at low temperature, has limited ranges of density and calorific value, burns cleanly, and remains chemically stable when heated to high temperature.

Aviation gasoline, often referred to as &quot;avgas&quot; or &quot;100-LL&quot; (&quot;low-lead&quot;), is a highly refined form of gasoline for aircraft, with an emphasis on purity, anti-knock characteristics and minimization of spark plug fouling. Avgas must meet performance guidelines for both the rich mixture condition required for take-off power settings and the leaner mixtures used during cruise to reduce fuel consumption. Aviation fuel can be used as CNG fuel.

Avgas is sold in much lower volume than jet fuel, but to many more individual aircraft operators, whereas jet fuel is sold in high volume to large aircraft operators, such as airlines and militaries.

==Energy content==
The net energy content for aviation fuels depends on their composition. Some typical values are:

*BP Avgas 80, 44.65 MJ/kg, density at 15 °C is 690 kg/m3 ( MJ/litre).
*Kerosene type BP Jet A-1, 43.15 MJ/kg, density at 15 °C is 804 kg/m3 ( MJ/litre).
*Kerosene type BP Jet TS-1 (for lower temperatures), 43.2 MJ/kg, density at 15 °C is 787 kg/m3 ( MJ/litre).

==Density==
In performance calculations, airliner manufacturers use a density of jet fuel around . 

Specific cases are:

* Bombardier Aerospace: The Challenger Multi-role Aircraft is a special mission variant of the Bombardier Challenger 650 business jet platform. Bombardier bases performance on the use of fuel with an average lower heating value of 18,550 BTU/lb (43.147 MJ/kg) and a density of .
* Embraer: In its airport planning manual for the E195, Embraer uses an adopted fuel density of .

== Chemical composition ==
Aviation fuels consist of blends of over two thousand chemicals, primarily hydrocarbons (paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics), additives such as antioxidants and metal deactivators, biocides, static reducers, icing inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, and impurities. Principal components include n-heptane and isooctane. Like other fuels, aviation fuel for spark-ignited piston engines are described by their octane rating.

Alcohol, alcohol mixtures, and other alternative fuels may be used experimentally, but alcohol is not permitted in any certified aviation fuel specification. In Brazil, the Embraer Ipanema EMB-202A is a version of the Ipanema agricultural aircraft with a modified Lycoming IO-540-K1J5 engine so as to be able to run on ethanol. Other aircraft engines that were modified to run on 100% ethanol were several other types of Lycoming engines (including the Lycoming 235N2C, and Lycoming IO-320) and certain Rotax engines.

==Tax==
The Convention on International Civil Aviation (ICAO) (Chicago 1944, Article 24) exempts air fuels already loaded onto an aircraft on landing (and which remain on the aircraft) from import taxes. Bi-lateral air services agreements govern the tax exemption of aviation fuels. In the course of an EU initiative, many of these agreements have been modified to allow taxation. A motion for a European Parliament resolution on a European Strategy for Low-emission Mobility has stated that &quot;the possibilities for harmonised international measures for kerosene taxation for aviation&quot; needs to be explored. 

A worry is that a local aviation fuel tax would cause increased tankering, where airlines carry extra fuel from low tax jurisdictions. This extra weight increases fuel burn, thus a local fuel tax could potentially increase overall fuel consumption. To avoid increased tankering, a worldwide aviation fuel tax has been proposed. Australia and the United States oppose a worldwide aviation fuel tax, but a number of other countries have expressed interest.

During a debate in the UK Parliament, the forgone tax income due to the exemption of tax on aviation fuel was estimated at £10 billion annually.

The planned inclusion of international aviation into the European Union Emission Trading Scheme in 2014 has been called an &quot;illegal tax&quot; by countries including the US and China, which cite the Chicago Convention.

== Certification ==
Fuels have to conform to a specification in order to be approved for use in type certificated aircraft. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) developed specifications for automobile gasoline as well as aviation gasoline. These specifications are ASTM D910 and ASTM D6227 for aviation gasoline and ASTM D439 or ASTM D4814 (latest revision) for automobile gasoline.

== In use ==

Aviation fuel generally arrives at the airport via pipeline systems, such as the CEPS. It is then pumped over and dispensed from a tanker or bowser. The fuel is then driven up to parked aircraft and helicopters. Some airports have pumps similar to filling stations to which aircraft must taxi. Some airports have permanent piping to parking areas for large aircraft.

Aviation fuel is transferred to an aircraft via one of two methods: overwing or underwing.

===Overwing===

Overwing fueling is used on smaller planes, helicopters, and all piston-engine aircraft. Overwing fueling is similar to car fueling — one or more fuel ports are opened and fuel is pumped in with a conventional pump.

===Underwing===
Underwing fueling, also called single-point refueling or pressure refueling where not dependent on gravity, is used on larger aircraft and for jet fuel exclusively.

For pressure refueling, a high-pressure hose is attached and fuel is pumped in at 275 kPa (40 psi) and a maximum of 310 kPa (45 psi) for most commercial aircraft. Pressure for military aircraft, especially fighters, ranges up to 415 kPa (60 psi). Air being displaced in the tanks is usually vented overboard through a single vent on the aircraft. Because there is only one attachment point, fuel distribution between tanks is either automated or controlled from a control panel, either at the fueling point or in the cockpit. An early use of pressure refueling was on the de Havilland Comet and Sud Aviation Caravelle. Larger aircraft allow for two or more attachment points; however, this is still referred to as single-point refueling, as either attachment point can refuel all of the tanks. Multiple attachments allow for a faster flowrate.

===Misfueling===
Because of the danger of confusing the fuel types, precautions are taken to distinguish between avgas and jet fuel beyond clearly marking all containers, vehicles, and piping. The aperture on fuel tanks of aircraft requiring avgas cannot be greater than 60 millimetres in diameter. Avgas is often dyed and is dispensed from nozzles with a diameter of 40 mm (49 mm in the United States).

Jet fuel is clear to straw-colored and is dispensed from a special nozzle, called a &quot;J spout&quot; or &quot;duckbill&quot;, that has a rectangular opening larger than 60 mm diagonally, so as not to fit into avgas ports. However, some jet and other turbine aircraft, such as some models of the Astar helicopter, have a fueling port too small for the J spout, and thus require a smaller nozzle.

===Forecasting demand===
In recent years, fuel markets have become increasingly volatile. This, along with rapidly changing airline schedules and the desire to not carry excess fuel on board aircraft, has increased the importance of demand forecasting. In March 2022, Austin&#x27;s Austin–Bergstrom International Airport came close to running out of fuel, potentially stranding aircraft. Common forecasting techniques include tracking airline schedules and routes, expected distance flown, ground procedures, fuel efficiency of each aircraft and the impact of environmental factors like weather and temperature.

== Safety precautions ==

Any fueling operation can be very dangerous, and aviation operations have characteristics which must be accommodated. As an aircraft flies through the air, it can accumulate static electricity. If this is not dissipated before fueling, an electric arc could occur and ignite fuel vapors. To prevent this, aircraft are electrically bonded to the fueling apparatus before fueling begins, and are not disconnected until after fueling is complete. Some regions require the aircraft and/or fuel truck to be grounded too. Pressure fueling systems incorporate a dead man&#x27;s switch to preclude unmonitored operation.

Aviation fuel can cause severe environmental damage; all fueling vehicles must carry equipment to control fuel spills. Fire extinguishers must be present at any fueling operation. Airport firefighting forces are specially trained and equipped to handle aviation fuel fires and spills. Aviation fuel must be checked daily and before every flight for contaminants such as water or dirt.

Avgas is the only remaining lead-containing transportation fuel. Lead in avgas prevents damaging engine knock, or detonation, that can result in a sudden engine failure.

<text>Marcin Kromer (Latin: &quot;Martinus Cromerus&quot;; 11 November 1512 – 23 March 1589) was Prince-Bishop of Warmia (Ermland), a Polish cartographer, diplomat and historian in the Kingdom of Poland and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was a personal secretary to two Kings of Poland, Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus.

==Biography==
Kromer was born in 1512 into a prominent burgher family of German descent in Biecz, in Lesser Poland. He completed his basic education in a local church-run school. In 1528 he transferred to Kraków, where in 1530 he graduated as a bachelor at the Cracow Academy. In 1533–37 he worked at the Royal Chancellery in Kraków. Thereafter he went to Italy, where he studied law for two years. Returning to Poland in 1540, he became secretary to Archbishop Piotr Gamrat. As the latter&#x27;s personal advisor, he was also his envoy and representative to Rome, where he spent two years until 1544. He then became a canon in Kraków.

In 1545, upon the death of his mentor, Kromer accepted the latter&#x27;s post as personal secretary to Poland&#x27;s King Sigismund I the Old. He was also an associate of Samuel Maciejowski, who later became Chancellor of the Crown. A specialist on Royal Prussia and Warmia, in 1551 Kromer became head of the Warmian canonry. However, his church career did not proceed as planned, since he was seen as one of the best Polish diplomats of the age and was frequently required by the court to leave his post to serve as envoy on various diplomatic missions. In 1552, for his services to the King, he was ennobled and granted a coat of arms.

From 1558 to 1564 Kromer served as Polish envoy to Emperor Ferdinand I, who in recognition of Kromer&#x27;s services added his own family coat-of-arms to Kromer&#x27;s. The latter&#x27;s tasks included advocacy of King Sigismund&#x27;s claims to the inheritance of the late Queen-Consort Bona Sforza, which was also claimed by the King of Spain, who, however, based his claims on a forged testament.

In 1564 Kromer was recalled to Poland, where he was promoted within the church hierarchy and took the post of coadjutor (&quot;de facto&quot; bishop) of the Bishopric of Warmia, to succeed on the demise of Prince-Bishop Stanislaus Hosius. After nine years at that post, Kromer was officially promoted to Prince-Bishop. He spent the rest of his days in Warmia, keeping diaries and writing several books on the history of Poland. He died on 23 March 1589 in Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński).

In his works, Kromer advocated the reform of Poland&#x27;s scientific and cultural life. One of his notable demands was providing the Cracow Academy with new privileges to restore its position as one of the renowned universities in Central Europe. He also promoted the active defence of the Roman Catholic Church against the growing Reformation.

Martin Kromer and Stanislaus Hosius (Stanisław Hozjusz) were the two bishops most instrumental in causing Royal Prussia&#x27;s diocese of Warmia to return to or remain Catholic during a time of major conversions to Protestantism, especially in the neighboring Duchy of Prussia which almost surrounded the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, and had converted to Lutheranism as the first state to do so.

<text>Douglas Mountjoy (8 June 1942 – 14 February 2021) was a Welsh snooker player from Tir-y-Berth, Gelligaer, Wales. He was a member of the professional snooker circuit from the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, and remained within the top 16 of the world rankings for 11 consecutive years. He began his professional snooker career by taking the 1977 Masters, which he entered as a reserve player. He won both the 1978 UK Championship and the 1979 Irish Masters. Mountjoy reached the final of the 1981 World Snooker Championship where he was defeated by Steve Davis. He was also runner-up at the 1985 Masters losing to Cliff Thorburn, but by 1988 he had dropped out of the top 16.

Mountjoy enjoyed a resurgence in his 40s, and at the age of 46 he defeated Stephen Hendry in the final of the 1988 UK Championship. He followed up by also winning the next ranking event, the 1989 Classic, and by the end of the 1988–89 season he was back in the top 16, where he remained until 1992. His world ranking peaked at number five in 1990–1991. He also won five Welsh Professional Championship titles during his career.

Diagnosed with lung cancer in 1993, Mountjoy qualified for the World Championship at the age of 50, just weeks before having a lung surgically removed. He continued to play professionally until 1997, and he was coach to the United Arab Emirates snooker association between 1997 and 1999 and appeared sporadically at the World Snooker Championship until 2002. Mountjoy died in February 2021 after a stroke.

== Early life ==
Doug Mountjoy was born on 8 June 1942, in Tir-y-Berth, Gelligaer, Glamorgan, Wales. He was brought up just outside Ebbw Vale and worked for some years as a coal miner, playing snooker in his spare time. A popular player in the South Wales Valleys as a junior, he won many amateur tournaments including two Welsh Amateur titles and the World Amateur title in 1976, after defeating Paul Mifsud 11–1. After the World Amateur victory he turned professional at the age of 34.

== Career ==
Mountjoy&#x27;s first professional tournament, which he entered as a late replacement, was the 1977 Masters at the New London Theatre. After defeating former world champions John Pulman, Fred Davis, and Alex Higgins to reach the final, he beat the defending Masters champion and reigning world champion Ray Reardon 7–6 to win the title.

At the 1977 World Championship a couple of months later, he defeated Higgins again in the first round but lost to Dennis Taylor in the quarter-final 11–13. At the end of 1977, he reached the final of the first UK Snooker Championship, losing to Patsy Fagan 9–12. He won the title at the 1978 UK Championship, however, beating David Taylor 15–9, and he defeated Ray Reardon in the same season to win the Irish Masters 6–5. He won the 1980 Champion of Champions, with a 10–8 victory over John Virgo in the final. Mountjoy also won the 1978 Pot Black event.

After being part of the winning Wales team in the first two snooker World Challenge Cups, in 1979 and 1980, and winning the 1980 Welsh Professional Championship he had an attack of Bell&#x27;s palsy which partially paralysed his face. Recovering from the attack, he reached the final of the 1981 World Championship, defeating Eddie Charlton, Dennis Taylor and, in the semi-final, Ray Reardon (against whom he made a 145 break, a championship record at the time). He then played Steve Davis in the final. Davis was favourite to win his first world title, and appeared to be racing to an easy victory by winning the first six frames of the match. However, Mountjoy recovered and came close to drawing level on several occasions. Trailing 11–13, and with the score at 60–63 in the 25th frame, he looked certain to cut Davis&#x27;s lead to one frame but missed a simple blue from its spot; Davis went on to clear the colours, the final black. Mountjoy won only one more frame as Davis won the match 18–12.

After that run at the World Championship, he had only a short run of titles; he won the Welsh Professional Championship in 1982 and 1984 to go with his 1980 title. He was back in the final of a major again in the 1985 Masters tournament, losing to Cliff Thorburn 9–6. Mountjoy also reclaimed the &quot;Pot Black&quot; title in March that year.

He won another Welsh title in 1987 but otherwise struggled to regain his previous form, including a 1–9 defeat to Steve Longworth in the first round of the 1986 UK Championship. By 1988 he was out of the top 16 in the world rankings. In the 1988–89 snooker season, however, he reached the final of the 1988 UK Championship where he met Stephen Hendry. He won 16–12 and gained his first ranking tournament victory, having at one stage scored centuries in three consecutive frames. In January 1989 he won the Classic, beating fellow Welshman Wayne Jones in the final, to win consecutive ranking titles. This was enough for him to return to the top 16 the next season, and by 1990 he was number five in the world. He remained in the top 16 until 1992.

Mountjoy was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1993, having been a smoker for many years. That year, at the age of 50, he defeated Alain Robidoux 10–6 in the first round of the World Championship, only weeks before an operation to remove his left lung. This was his last appearance in the final stages of the championship and for fifteen years he was the last player aged over 50 to appear at The Crucible. He survived the cancer and continued to play snooker until 1997, after which he concentrated on snooker coaching. He would coach in the United Arab Emirates, but did appear in qualifying for the 2002 World Snooker Championship.

== Death ==
Mountjoy died on 14 February 2021, at the age of 78 after a stroke. In a joint statement, World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn and World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association chairman Jason Ferguson said: &quot;Doug was first and foremost a lovely man, who had great friendships with many players on the tour throughout the 1970s and onwards.&quot;

<text>Frédéric Monod (17 May 1794, in Monnaz - 30 December 1863, in Paris) was a French Protestant pastor. He was the older brother of minister Adolphe Monod. He was born citizen of the Republic of Geneva, and obtained the French nationality by naturalization in 1820.

He studied theology in Geneva, receiving his consecration in 1818. As a student, he was greatly influenced by the Scottish minister Robert Haldane. From 1820 to 1849 he was a Reformed Church pastor in Paris. In 1849, along with Agénor de Gasparin, he founded the Union of the Evangelical Free Churches of France.

From 1824 up until his death in 1863, he was principal editor of the &quot;Archives du Christianisme&quot;.

His son, Théodore, (1836–1921) followed in his footsteps. Naturalist and explorer Théodore André Monod is his great-grandson.

<text>William Joseph Thorne (4 March 195417 June 2020) was an English professional snooker player. He won one ranking title, the 1985 Classic. He also reached the final of the 1985 UK Championship, losing 16–14 to Steve Davis after leading 13–8. He was noted for his break-building, and was among the first players to compile 100 century breaks. He earned the nickname &quot;Mr Maximum&quot;. After retiring as a player, Thorne became a snooker commentator, primarily for the BBC.

==Career==
Thorne was born on 4 March 1954 at the family home in Anstey, a village located near Leicester, to Bill Thorne, a Desford Colliery miner, and his wife Nancy. He had two brothers. Thorne was educated at the Thomas Rawlins School in Quorn, and played multiple sports but excelled the most in snooker. He began playing snooker while holidaying in Eastbourne at the age of 14. He left school at age 15 and became an estimator for a glass factory while practising snooker in Loughborough and then Leicester&#x27;s snooker halls. Thorne became national Under-16 snooker champion in 1970, and won three consecutive National Under-19 Billiards Championship titles from 1971 to 1973.

He turned professional in 1975, but never really converted his early promise into success, only winning one ranking snooker tournament (The Classic in 1985). The same year, he reached the 1985 UK Championship final against the then dominant Steve Davis and seemed to have built himself an unassailable 13–8 lead, but a miss on a straightforward off its during the first of the final session allowed Davis to take the frame and eventually win the title. Thorne later said that he had &quot;hardly looked&quot; at the blue, considering it a &quot;certainty&quot;. Thorne was runner-up in four other events that season: the British Open (losing 7–12 to Davis), the Scottish Masters (losing 7–9 to Cliff Thorburn), the Irish Masters (losing 5–9 to Jimmy White) and the Pontins Professional (losing 6–9 to Terry Griffiths).

He reached the quarter-finals of the World Snooker Championship in 1982 and 1986. Thorne won the 1986 Hong Kong Masters by 8–3 over Dennis Taylor in the final with century breaks of 102 and 106, and then defeated Davis 10–9 to claim the 1986 Matchroom Professional Championship.

He peaked at No. 7 in the world rankings in the mid-1980s, while also battling a serious gambling problem. Thorne began gambling when he frequented a billiard hall in central Leicester from the age of 16. In one incident, Thorne bet £38,000 on a match involving John Parrott, betting that Parrott would lose as he had lost his personal cue and had to use one supplied by the venue. Much to Thorne&#x27;s dismay, not least because he was actually commentating on the match, Parrott recovered from a slow start to win, only worsening Thorne&#x27;s debts. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in 2004, Thorne admitted to placing bets of up to £20,000 on horses.

Thorne&#x27;s bald head made him instantly recognisable and he was often referred to as the &quot;Homer Simpson of Snooker&quot;. He first began commentating for the BBC during the 1980s, and he continued to work on the BBC&#x27;s networked snooker coverage until he was dropped from the corporation&#x27;s broadcast team after the 2017–18 season. He also had stints commentating on snooker for Sky and ITV. Thorne continued to commentate for BBC Wales on their coverage of the Welsh Open in February each year.

Alongside other Matchroom professionals, Thorne featured in the popular song &quot;Snooker Loopy&quot;, written and performed by Chas &amp; Dave. In the verse which begins &quot;but old Willie Thorne, his hair&#x27;s all gorn&quot;, Thorne&#x27;s cameo line was &quot;Perhaps I ought to chalk it&quot;, in reference to his gleaming head distracting his opponents. Thorne also appeared in the &quot;Romford Rap&quot; video with the rest of the &quot;Matchroom Mob&quot;.

Thorne was described as a skilled break-builder and possibly the &quot;missing link&quot; between old-school percentage play and the current aggressive game. He took 19 seasons to record 100 competitive century breaks. He was only the third player to achieve this feat and achieved a maximum break at the 1987 UK Championship. Thorne claimed to have made almost 200 maximum breaks, and was known as &quot;Mr Maximum&quot;. Thorne won the World Seniors Masters in 2000, beating Cliff Thorburn in the final.

After retiring from the game in 2001, Thorne did not play another match for sixteen years; however, he returned to action in 2017 in the World Seniors Championship, where he lost 1–3 in the first round to Aiden Owens. The World Seniors Tour was formed in the same year, but Thorne did not enter any events that season. He began his comeback in 2019 at the Seniors Irish Masters, where he faced Jimmy White in his first match in the quarter-finals, losing 0–3, and the World Seniors Championship, where he lost by the same scoreline in the first round to Darren Morgan. His next match, in the first round of the 2019 UK Seniors Championship, proved to be his last; drawn against Michael Judge, Thorne lost 2–3.

Thorne also held the all-time record in the &quot;Pocket Money&quot; round of the BBC show &quot;Big Break&quot;, with a score of £540, until it was broken by Tony Knowles&#x27; score of £580 in April 1996.

==Personal life==
Thorne was married to former Miss Great Britain winner Jill Saxby and lived in Broughton Astley. He was previously married to Fiona Walker, with whom he had twin sons and a daughter. From 1982, he ran the Willie Thorne Snooker Centre club in Leicester, converted from a former motor taxation office, where Mark Selby used to compete in junior tournaments. In 2004, Thorne and writer Derek Marsden co-authored his first autobiography, &quot;Double or Quits&quot;. His second autobiography, &quot;Taking a Punt on My Life&quot;, was published in 2011.

In 2007, Thorne competed in Series 5 of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; with professional dance partner Erin Boag. They were voted off in the third week. He was friends with footballer Gary Lineker, which was the subject of the VHS production, &quot;Best of Friends – The Official Story of Gary Lineker &amp; Willie Thorne&quot;. In 1985, Lineker was best man at Thorne&#x27;s wedding. Thorne was a lifelong fan of Leicester City.

===Illness and death===
In June 2015, Thorne was diagnosed with prostate cancer after a psychiatrist ordered routine blood tests. After diagnosis, Thorne began treatment.

Thorne tweeted on 18 March 2020 that he had been diagnosed with leukaemia. On 16 June 2020, he was placed in an induced coma after suffering respiratory failure in hospital in Spain. The following day, his carer reported that Thorne had gone into septic shock, was not responding to treatment, and died after his life support was withdrawn, aged 66.

<doc id="642322" wikidata="Q813772" url="?curid=642322" title="Becontree tube station">
<text>Becontree () is a London Underground station located to the south of Becontree in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, east London. It is on the District line between to the west and to the east. It is along the line from the eastern terminus at and to in central London where the line divides into numerous branches. It is in London fare zone 5.

The station was originally opened as Gale Street Halt in 1926 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on the existing route from in London toward Southend. The station was renamed and completely rebuilt in 1932 with an additional pair of platforms to serve the electric District Railway (now the District line) local service. Main-line services ceased to call at the station in the 1960s, leaving only two platforms in operation.

==History==

In 1858 a line through East Ham was constructed to provide a faster connection between Barking and the city of London, which connects to the London and Blackwall Railway route to Fenchurch Street. Between 1885 and 1888, the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) constructed a line between Barking and Pitsea via Upminster to provide a more direct route between the two cities. The station was not built at the time.

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) took ownership of the London, Tilbury and Southend line in 1923 and the station opened as Gale Street Halt on 28 June 1926 to serve the new Becontree Estate and subsequent residential areas. Initially, there were no roads leading to the station. In 1929, the company proposed quadrupling their line between Barking and Upminster and electrifying one pair of tracks for the District line. The station was rebuilt and new platforms were constructed for the new pair of tracks. Gale Street Halt was renamed as Becontree and the new station building to the designs of the architect William Henry Hamlyn opened on 18 July 1932, with electrified District line services starting operation 2 months after on 12 September. In addition to the start of electrified services, two new adjacent stations on the District line named Upney and Heathway (now Dagenham Heathway) opened.

By 1935, there were approximately 18,000 homes in this area, and together with developers, Dagenham Council added more than 5000 homes until 1965. By 1940, the population grew to 116,000. This particular section of the line between Barking and Upminster was popular among commuters getting to West and East Ham which reduced the need for bus services. Other reasons were a shortened travel time to Charing Cross of up to 35 minutes and the good availability of trains servicing this part of the line.

The slow tracks on the former LT&amp;SR line to Upminster were shared with steam locomotive hauled goods and passenger services, until 1961 when the District line took over exclusive use of the DC electrified lines. LT&amp;SR services ceased to stop at the station on 15 June 1962.

===Becontree Estate Railway===

The railway here was crossed by Becontree Estate Railway, a temporary railway constructed as part of the building of the Becontree housing estate which operated between 1921 and 1934. Becontree estate was constructed in the 1920s by C. J. Wills and Sons Ltd., with the remainder completed in 1938. The estate was once to be served by high speed tramways, with services starting from Ilford, branching out into the estate and then rejoining the current line to Barking. This was not supported by Ilford and Barking councils, and was abandoned due to problems with Ilford authorities and the need to electrify the Barking to Upminster line. There was also a deferred plan for a Kearney Monorail tube connecting Becontree to the city.

==Design==

The station has four platforms, of which two are used by the District line and another two are disused since the LT&amp;SR service was withdrawn in 1962. One of the platforms is fenced off from the westbound District line platform. The single-storey brick station buildings are of typical 1930s design which are also constructed at Dagenham East, Hornchurch and Upminster at the time. Station refurbishment works were completed by Metronet in 2006, where heritage features were restored, CCTV equipment replaced and PA system enhanced. New wall tiles and ceilings were clad, and new tactile strips, customer Help Points and better lighting were installed. Whilst these works were done between 2005 and 2006, the station was closed on several weekends whereby replacement buses operated to Dagenham Heathway station.

==Location==
The station is located on the west side of Gale Street. It serves the residential area of Becontree, which is to the north of the station. There is a commercial area to the south of the station, while Parsloes Park is to the north. Nearby landmarks include a driving school, the Jo Richardson Community School, Roding Primary School and The James Campbell Primary School. It is in London fare zone 5.

London Bus routes 62 and 145 serve the station.

==Services==
Becontree is on the Upminster part of the line between Upney and Dagenham Heathway. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*12 tph eastbound to Upminster
*6 tph westbound to Ealing Broadway
*6 tph westbound to Richmond

==In popular culture==
The station is said to be haunted by a faceless woman with long blonde hair that several staff members have sighted. A possible connection to this could be that in 1958 there was a collision between two trains near Becontree Station that led to the deaths of 10 people.

<text>McKinsey &amp; Company (informally McKinsey or McK) is an American multinational strategy and management consulting firm that offers professional services to corporations, governments, and other organizations. Founded in 1926 by James O. McKinsey, McKinsey is the oldest and largest of the &quot;MBB&quot; management consultancies. The firm mainly focuses on the finances and operations of their clients.

Under the direction of Marvin Bower, McKinsey expanded into Europe during the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s, McKinsey&#x27;s Fred Gluck—along with Boston Consulting Group&#x27;s Bruce Henderson, Bill Bain at Bain &amp; Company, and Harvard Business School&#x27;s Michael Porter—initiated a program designed to transform corporate culture. A 1975 publication by McKinsey&#x27;s John L. Neuman introduced the business practice of &quot;overhead value analysis&quot; that contributed to a downsizing trend that eliminated many jobs in middle management.

McKinsey has been the subject of significant controversy and is the subject of multiple criminal investigations into its business practices. The company has been criticized for its role promoting OxyContin use during the opioid crisis in North America, its work with Enron, and its work for authoritarian regimes like Saudi Arabia and Russia. The criminal investigation by the US Justice Department, with a grand jury to determine charges, is into its role in the opioid crisis and obstruction of justice related to its activities in the sector. McKinsey works with some of the largest fossil fuel producing governments and companies, including to increase fossil fuel demand.

McKinsey has a notoriously competitive hiring process and is widely seen as one of the most selective employers in the world. McKinsey recruits primarily from top business schools and was one of the first management consultancies to recruit a limited number of candidates with advanced academic degrees (e.g., PhD) and deep field expertise, and who have demonstrated business acumen and analytical skills. McKinsey publishes a business magazine, the &quot;McKinsey Quarterly&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===

McKinsey &amp; Company was founded in Chicago under the name James O. McKinsey &amp; Company in 1926 by James O. McKinsey, a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago. He conceived the idea after he had witnessed inefficiencies in military suppliers while he was working for the United States Army Ordnance Department. The firm called itself an &quot;accounting and management firm&quot; and started out giving advice on using accounting principles as a management tool. McKinsey&#x27;s first partners were AT Kearney, hired in 1929, and Marvin Bower, hired in 1933.
Bower is credited with establishing McKinsey&#x27;s values and principles in 1937, based on his experience as a lawyer. The firm developed an &quot;up or out&quot; policy, where consultants who are not promoted are asked to leave. In 1937, Bower established a set of rules: that consultants should put the interests of clients before McKinsey&#x27;s revenues, not discuss client affairs, tell the truth even if it means challenging the client&#x27;s opinion, and only perform work that is both necessary and that McKinsey can do well. Bower created the firm&#x27;s principle of only working with CEOs, which was later expanded to CEOs of subsidiaries and divisions. He also created McKinsey&#x27;s principle of only working with clients the firm felt would follow its advice. Bower also established the firm&#x27;s language.

In 1932, the company opened its second office in New York City. In 1935, McKinsey left the firm temporarily to be the chairman and CEO of client Marshall Field&#x27;s.

In 1935, McKinsey merged with accounting firm Scovell, Wellington &amp; Company, creating the New York-based McKinsey, Wellington &amp; Co. and splitting off the accounting practice into Chicago-based Wellington &amp; Company. A Wellington project that accounted for 55 percent of McKinsey, Wellington &amp; Company&#x27;s billings was about to expire and Kearney and Bower had disagreements about how to run the firm. Bower wanted to expand nationally and hire young business school graduates, whereas Kearney wanted to stay in Chicago and hire experienced accountants.

In 1937, James O. McKinsey died after catching pneumonia. This led to the division of McKinsey, Wellington &amp; Company in 1939. The accounting practice returned to Scovell, Wellington &amp; Company, while the management engineering practice was split into McKinsey &amp; Company and McKinsey, Kearney &amp; Company. Bower had partnered with Guy Crockett from Scovell Wellington, who invested in the new McKinsey &amp; Company and became managing partner, while Marvin Bower is credited with founding the firm&#x27;s principles and strategy as his deputy. The New York office purchased exclusive rights to the McKinsey name from the former McKinsey Chicago office which was separated with AT Kearney in 1946.

===Years of growth===
McKinsey &amp; Company grew quickly in the 1940s and 1950s, especially in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities, including San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, and Amsterdam, as well as in Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company&#x27;s revenues originated from its European offices. Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1959, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey&#x27;s profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization&#x27;s client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, blue-chip companies and military organizations in the post–World War II era. McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.

After Bower stepped down in 1967, the firm&#x27;s revenues declined. New competitors like the Boston Consulting Group and Bain &amp; Company created increased competition for McKinsey by marketing specific branded products, such as the Growth–Share Matrix, and by selling their industry expertise.

In 1971, McKinsey created the Commission on Firm Aims and Goals, which found that McKinsey had become too focused on geographic expansion and lacked adequate industry knowledge. The commission advised that McKinsey slow its growth and develop industry specialties.

In 1975, John L. Neuman, a McKinsey consultant at the time, published &quot;Make Overhead Cuts That Last&quot; in &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, in which he introduced new rules for scientific management such as &quot;overhead valuation analysis&quot; (OVA). OVA guided McKinsey&#x27;s &quot;path to downsizing&quot;, responding to the &quot;mid-century corporation&#x27;s excessive reliance on middle management&quot;. Neuman wrote that the &quot;process, though swift, is not painless. Since overhead expenses are typically 70% to 85% people-related and most savings come from work-force reductions, cutting overhead does demand some wrenching decisions.&quot;

In 1976, Ron Daniel was elected managing director, serving until 1988. Daniel and Fred Gluck helped shift the firm away from its generalist approach by developing 15 specialized working groups within McKinsey called Centers of Competence and by developing practice areas called Strategy, Operations and Organization. Daniel also began McKinsey&#x27;s knowledge management efforts in 1987. This led to the creation of an IT system that tracked McKinsey engagements, a process to centralize knowledge from each practice area and a resource directory of internal experts.&quot; By the end of his tenure in 1988 the firm was growing again and had opened new offices in Rome, Helsinki, São Paulo and Minneapolis.

Fred Gluck was McKinsey&#x27;s managing director from 1988 to 1994. The firm&#x27;s revenues doubled during his tenure. He organized McKinsey into 72 &quot;islands of activity&quot; that were organized under seven sectors and seven functional areas. By 1997, McKinsey had grown eightfold over its size in 1977. In 1989 the firm tried to acquire talent in IT services through a $10 million purchase of the Information Consulting Group (ICG), but a culture clash caused 151 out of the 254 ICG staff members to leave by 1993.

In 1994, Rajat Gupta became the first non-American-born partner to be elected as the firm&#x27;s managing director. By the end of his tenure, McKinsey had grown from 2,900 to 7,700 staff and 58 to 84 locations. He opened new international offices in cities such as Moscow, Beijing and Bangkok. Continuing the structure developed by prior directors, Gupta also created 16 industry groups charged with understanding specific markets and instituted a three-term limit for the managing director. McKinsey created practice areas for manufacturing and business technology in the late 1990s.

McKinsey set up &quot;accelerators&quot; in the 1990s, where the firm accepted stock-based reimbursement to help internet startups; the company performed more than 1,000 e-commerce projects from 1998 to 2000 alone.

An October 1, 2000, article in the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the compulsory mini-courses that McKinsey—and its two largest rivals Boston Consulting and Bain—offered their &quot;hyper-educated&quot; young new recruits. Once completed, these newly certified management consultants would begin their work of &quot;advising the executives of multibillion-dollar companies&quot; on &quot;projects&quot; not related to their academic backgrounds&quot;—&quot;[l]awyers would help packaged-foods companies develop new products, and physicists would tell Internet start-ups how to stand out from the crowd.&quot;

The burst of the dot-com bubble led to a reduction in utilization rates of McKinsey&#x27;s consultants from 64 to 52 percent. Though McKinsey avoided dismissing any personnel following the decline, the decline in revenues and losses from equity-based payments as stock lost value, together with a recession in 2001, meant the company had to reduce its prices, cut expenses and reduce hiring.

In 2001, McKinsey launched several practices that focused on the public and social sector. It took on many public sector or non profit clients on a pro bono basis. By 2002, McKinsey had invested a $35.8 million budget on knowledge management, up from $8.3 million in 1999. Its revenues were 50, 20, and 30 percent from strategy, operations, and technology consulting, respectively.

In 2003, Ian Davis, the head of the London office, was elected to the position of managing director. Davis promised a return to the company&#x27;s core values after a period in which the firm had expanded rapidly, which some McKinsey consultants felt was a departure from the company&#x27;s heritage. Also in 2003, the firm established a headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai. By 2004, more than 60 percent of McKinsey&#x27;s revenues were generated outside the U.S. The company started a Social Sector Office (SSO) in 2008, which is divided into three practices: Global Public Health, Economic Development and Opportunity Creation (EDHOC) and Philanthropy. McKinsey does much of its pro-bono work through the SSO, whereas a Business Technology Office (BTO), founded in 1997, provides consulting on technology strategy.

By 2009, the firm consisted of 400 directors (senior partners), up from 151 in 1993. Dominic Barton was elected as managing director, a role he was re-elected for in 2012 and 2015.

===Recent history===

Rajat Gupta along with another McKinsey executive, Anil Kumar, were among those convicted in a government investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself on integrity and client confidentiality. McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner.

Senior partner Anil Kumar, described as Gupta&#x27;s protégé, left the firm after the allegations in 2009, and pleaded guilty in January 2010. While he and other partners had been pitching McKinsey&#x27;s consulting services to the Galleon Group, Kumar and Rajaratnam reached a private consulting agreement, violating McKinsey&#x27;s policies on confidentiality. Gupta was convicted in June 2012, of four counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, and acquitted on two counts. In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on charges of sharing insider information from these confidential board meetings with Rajaratnam. At least twice, Gupta used a McKinsey phone to call Rajaratnam and retained other perks—an office, assistant, and $6 million retirement salary that year—as a senior partner emeritus.

After the scandal McKinsey instituted new policies and procedures to discourage future indiscretions from consultants, including investigating other partners&#x27; ties to Gupta.

In February 2018, Kevin Sneader was elected as managing director. He had a three-year term that began on July 1, 2018.

McKinsey has consulted for multiple cities, states and government organizations during the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. During the first four months of the pandemic, McKinsey obtained in excess of $100 million in consulting work, including no-bid contracts with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and Air Force. The reopening guidelines for Florida&#x27;s Miami-Dade County, produced with McKinsey&#x27;s input, were criticized by local media and officials for complexity and lack of clarity.

McKinsey discontinued its investment banking advisory unit in 2021, citing &quot;personnel matters&quot; as the reason.

In 2021, McKinsey&#x27;s Australian office made two acquisitions, Hypothesis, a digital product development company, and Venturetec, an innovation consulting firm.

On June 1, 2022, McKinsey announced that it had acquired Caserta, a data engineering firm.

In March 2023, McKinsey announced a layoff of 1,400 employees, in a rare job cut of the company.

==Organization and services==
===Structure===

McKinsey &amp; Company was originally organized as a partnership before being legally restructured as a private corporation with shares owned by its partners in 1956. It mimics the structure of a partnership and senior employees are called &quot;partners&quot;. The company has a flat hierarchy and each member is assigned a mentor. Since the 1960s, McKinsey&#x27;s managing director has been elected by a vote of senior directors to work up to three, three-year terms or until reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60. The firm is also managed by a series of committees that each has its own area of responsibility.

By 2013, McKinsey was described as having a decentralized structure, whereby different offices operate similarly, but independently. The company&#x27;s budgeting is centralized, but individual consultants are given a large degree of autonomy. As a global firm McKinsey does not have a traditional &quot;headquarters&quot;; the managing partner chooses his or her home office.

===Consulting services===
McKinsey &amp; Company provides strategy and management consulting services, such as providing advice on an acquisition, developing a plan to restructure a sales force, creating a new business strategy or providing advice on downsizing, according to the 2013 book, &quot;The Firm&quot;. The 1999 book, &quot;The McKinsey Way&quot; said that McKinsey consultants designed and implemented studies to evaluate management decisions using data and interviews to test hypotheses. which were then presented to senior management, typically in a PowerPoint presentation and a booklet.

McKinsey &amp; Company has traditionally charged approximately 25 percent more than competing firms. Its invoices traditionally contain only a single line.

A typical McKinsey engagement (called a &quot;study&quot;) can last between two and twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants. An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client&#x27;s headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so).

===Recruiting===
McKinsey &amp; Company was the first management consultancy to hire recent graduates instead of experienced business managers, when it started doing so in 1953.

According to a 1997 article in &quot;The Observer&quot;, McKinsey recruited recent graduates and &quot;imbue[d] them with a religious conviction&quot; in the firm, then cull[ed] through them with its &quot;up-or-out&quot; policy. The &quot;up or out&quot; policy, which was established in 1951, meant that consultants that were not being promoted within the firm were asked to leave. By 1997, about one-fifth of McKinsey&#x27;s consultants departed under the up or out policy each year. McKinsey&#x27;s practice of hiring recent graduates and the &quot;up-or-out&quot; philosophy were originally based on Marvin Bower&#x27;s experiences at the law firm Jones Day in the 1930s, as well as the &quot;Cravath system&quot; used at the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore.

In recent years, it has consistently been recognized by Vault as the most prestigious consulting firm employer in the world.
In 2018, 800,000 candidates applied for 8,000 jobs.

While many recruits have MBAs, by 2009, less than half of the firm&#x27;s recruits were business majors; by 1999, recruits had advanced degrees in science, medicine, engineering or law.

===Culture===
A November 1, 1993, profile story in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine said that McKinsey &amp; Company was &quot;the most well-known, most secretive, most high-priced, most prestigious, most consistently successful, most envied, most trusted, most disliked management consulting firm on earth&quot;. In the article, McKinsey was cited as claiming that its consultants were not motivated by money, and that partners talked to each other with &quot;a sense of personal affection and admiration&quot;. The article described a culture clash that occurred in the early 1990s, leading to the departure of 151 out of the 254 ICG staff members.

In their 1997 book &quot;Dangerous Company: Management Consultants and the Businesses They Save and Ruin&quot;, authors James O&#x27;Shea and Charles Madigan said that McKinsey&#x27;s culture had often been compared to religion, because of the influence, loyalty and zeal of its members. The firm has a policy against discussing specific client situations. A September 1997 &quot;The News Observer&quot; story said that McKinsey&#x27;s internal culture was &quot;collegiate and ruthlessly competitive&quot; and has been described as arrogant. Ethan Rasiel&#x27;s 1999 book entitled &quot;The McKinsey Way&quot;, described a culture at McKinsey&#x27;s whereby members were not supposed to &quot;sell&quot; their services.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; wrote that McKinsey was a pioneer in the industry—the &quot;first firm to hire MBA graduates from the top business schools to staff its projects, rather than relying on older industry personnel.&quot; They were still trying to keep a &quot;very low profile public image&quot; in 2005. That year, an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that McKinsey &quot;hours are long, expectations high and failure not acceptable&quot;. According to an October 2009 Reuters article, the firm had a &quot;button-down culture&quot; focused on &quot;playing by the rules&quot;. In his 2013 book, &quot;The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business&quot;, Duff McDonald described how McKinsey&#x27;s consultants were expected to become a part of the community and recruit clients from church, charitable foundations, board positions and other community involvements. McDonald wrote that McKinsey calls itself &quot;The Firm&quot; and its employees &quot;members&quot;. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; summarized &quot;The Firm&quot;″s description of McKinsey as a &quot;fading empire, where hubris and changing times have diminished the firm&#x27;s statures.&quot;

In his February 2020 in-depth article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Daniel Markovits argues that McKinsey promotes &quot;intellect and elite credentials&quot; and &quot;Meritocrats&quot; over &quot;directly relevant experience&quot;.

==Influence==

Many of McKinsey&#x27;s alumni become CEOs of major corporations or hold important government positions. In doing so, they influence the other organizations with McKinsey&#x27;s values and culture. McKinsey&#x27;s alumni have been appointed as CEOs or high-level executives.

In his 2010 publication, &quot;The Lords of Strategy: The Secret Intellectual History of the New Corporate World&quot;, business journalist Walter Kiechel traced the roots of a profound change in corporate management to &quot;four mavericks&quot; in the 1960s—Fred Gluck at McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group&#x27;s Bruce Henderson, Bill Bain at Bain &amp; Company, and Harvard Business School professor, Michael Porter. Kiechel recounted how they &quot;revolutionized the way we think about business, changed the very soul of the corporation, and transformed the way we work,&quot; according to the Harvard Business Press synopsis.

McKinsey has been either directly involved in, or closely associated with, a number of notable scandals, involving Enron in 2001, Galleon in 2009, Valeant in 2015, Saudi Arabia in 2018, China in 2018, ICE in 2019, an internal conflict of interest in 2019 and Purdue Pharma in 2019, among others. By 2019, major news outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;ProPublica,&quot; had raised concerns about McKinsey&#x27;s business practices.

===Research and publishing===
McKinsey &amp; Company consultants regularly publish books, research and articles about business and management. The firm spends $50–$100 million a year on research. McKinsey was one of the first organizations to fund management research, when it founded the Foundation for Management Research in 1955. The firm began publishing a business magazine, &quot;The McKinsey Quarterly&quot;, in 1964. It funds the McKinsey Global Institute, which studies global economic trends and was founded in 1990. It also launched the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility in 2020 to fund research focused on advancing inclusive growth &amp; racial equity globally. Many consultants are contributors to the Harvard Business Review. McKinsey consultants published only two books from 1960 to 1980, then more than 50 from 1980 to 1996. McKinsey&#x27;s publications and research give the firm a &quot;quasi-academic&quot; image.

A McKinsey book, &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot;, was published in 1982. It featured eight characteristics of successful businesses based on an analysis of 43 top performing companies. It marked the beginning of McKinsey&#x27;s shift from accounting to &quot;softer&quot; aspects of management, like skills and culture. According to David Guest from King&#x27;s College, &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; became popular among business managers because it was easy to read, well-marketed and some of its core messages were valid. However, it was disliked by academics because of flaws in its methodology. Additionally, a 1984 analysis by &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; found that many of those companies identified as &quot;excellent&quot; in the book no longer met the criteria only two years later.

A 1997 article and a book it published in 2001 on &quot;The War for Talent&quot;
prompted academics and the business community to start focusing more on talent management. The authors found that the best-performing companies were &quot;obsessed&quot; with acquiring and managing the best talent. They advocated that companies rank employees by their performance and promote &quot;stars&quot;, while targeting under-performers for improvement or layoffs. After the book was published, Enron, a company which followed many of its principles, was involved in a scandal that led to its bankruptcy. In May 2001, a Stanford professor wrote a paper critical of the &quot;War on Talent&quot; arguing that it prioritized individuals at the expense of the larger organization.

McKinsey consultants published &quot;Creative Destruction&quot; in 2001. The book suggested that CEOs need to be willing to change or rebuild a company, rather than protect what they have created. It found that out of the first S&amp;P 500 list from 1957, only 74 were still in business by 1998. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it &quot;makes a cogent argument that in times of rampant, uncertain change ... established companies are handcuffed by success.&quot; In 2009, McKinsey consultants published &quot;The Alchemy of Growth&quot;, which established three &quot;horizons&quot; for growth: core enhancements, new growth platforms and options.

In February 2011, McKinsey surveyed 1,300 US private-sector employers on their expected response to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Thirty percent of respondents said they anticipated they would probably or definitely stop offering employer sponsored health coverage after the ACA went into effect in 2014. These results, published in June 2011 in the &quot;McKinsey Quarterly&quot;, became &quot;a useful tool for critics of the ACA and a deep annoyance for defenders of the law&quot; according to an article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Supporters of healthcare reform argued the survey far surpassed estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and insisted that McKinsey disclose the survey&#x27;s methodology. Two weeks after publishing the survey results, McKinsey released the contents of the survey including the questionnaire and 206 pages of survey data. In its accompanying statement, McKinsey said it was intended to capture the attitude of employers at a certain point in time, not make a prediction.

Since 1990, McKinsey has been publishing &quot;&quot;, a textbook on valuation.

In 2022, McKinsey senior partners Carolyn Dewar, Scott Keller, and Vikram Malhotra authored the book &quot;CEO Excellence&quot;, which was published by Scribner.

====Environmental consulting====
Marginal abatement cost curves attempt to compare the financial costs of different options for reducing pollution in a region and are used in emissions trading, policy discussions and incentive programs. McKinsey &amp; Company released its first marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for greenhouse gas emissions in February 2007, which was updated to version two in January 2009. McKinsey &amp; Company&#x27;s MAC curve has become the most widely used and is the basis for McKinsey&#x27;s consulting on climate change and sustainability.

McKinsey&#x27;s curve predicts negative cost abatement strategies, which has been controversial among economists. The International Association for Energy Economics said in &quot;The Energy Journal&quot; that McKinsey&#x27;s cost-curve was popular among policymakers, because it suggests they can take &quot;bold action towards improving energy efficiency without imposing costs on society.&quot;

In a 2010 report, the Rainforest Foundation UK said McKinsey&#x27;s cost curve methodology was misleading for policy decisions regarding the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) program. The report argued that McKinsey&#x27;s calculations exclude certain implementation and governance costs, which makes it favor industrial uses of forests while discouraging subsistence projects. Greenpeace said the curve has allowed Indonesia and Guyana to win financial incentives from the United Nations by creating inflated estimates of current deforestation so they could demonstrate reductions in comparison. McKinsey said they had made it clear in the cost-curve publications that cost curves do not translate &quot;mechanically&quot; into policy implications and that policymakers should consider &quot;many other factors&quot; before introducing new laws.

In April 2022, in the report &quot;Global Energy Perspective&quot; the company predicted that fossil fuels use will peak between 2023–2025 and in 2050 fossil fuels will account for 43% of energy consumption. Emissions will peak in all scenarios before 2030. However, the report of September 2024, said that fossil fuel consumption is expected to plateau between 2025 and 2035, and they will continue to play a major role accounting for 40%-60% of energy supply by 2050. Emissions will peak in 2025-2035. The report mention &quot;a more challenging geopolitical landscape&quot;, rising electricity demand, especially from Artificial intelligence, some technical problems that are complicating the transition. The low cost of renewables can make them less profitable, so regulation can be required for adoption. The company also created a new report &quot;Global Materials Perspective&quot;. It says that the energy transition require intensive mining of many materials, so even as the mining of coal will be reduced, the overall emissions from the mining and metal industry will decline only from 15% to 13% by 2035.

== Significant consulting projects ==
McKinsey &amp; Company&#x27;s founder, James O. McKinsey, introduced the concept of budget planning as a management framework in his fifth book &quot;Budgetary Control&quot; in 1922. The firm&#x27;s first client was the treasurer of Armour &amp; Company, who, along with other early McKinsey clients, had read &quot;Budgetary Control&quot;. In 1931 McKinsey created a methodology for analyzing a company called the General Survey Outline (GSO), which was established based on ideas introduced in the 1924 book &quot;Business Administration&quot;. It was also known as the Banker&#x27;s Survey, because McKinsey&#x27;s clients who used it in the 1930s were predominantly banks. After the Wagner Act gave certain rights to employees to organize into unions in 1935, McKinsey started consulting corporations on employee relations. Later in the 1950s, the work of a McKinsey consultant on compensation was influential in &quot;skyrocketing executive pay&quot;. It also helped many companies such as Heinz, IBM and Hoover expand into Europe.

In the 1940s, McKinsey helped many corporations convert into wartime production for World War II. It also helped organize NASA into an organization that relies heavily on contractors in 1958. McKinsey created a report in 1953 for Dwight D. Eisenhower that was used to guide government appointments. In 1973, McKinsey &amp; Company led a project for a consortium of grocery chains represented by the U.S. Supermarket Ad Hoc Committee on a Uniform Grocery Product Code to create the barcode. According to the book &quot;Business Research Methods&quot;, the barcode became commonplace after a study by McKinsey persuaded Kroger to adopt it.

In the 1970s and 1980s, McKinsey helped European companies change their organizational structure to M-form (Multidivisional Form), which organizes the company into semi-autonomous divisions that function around a product, industry or customer, rather than a function or expertise.

In the 1980s, AT&amp;T reduced investments in cell towers due to McKinsey&#x27;s prediction that there would only be 900,000 cell phone subscribers by 2000. According to &quot;The Firm&quot; this was &quot;laughably off the mark&quot; from the 109 million cellular subscribers by 2000. At the time cell phones were bulky and expensive. The firm helped the Dutch government facilitate a turnaround for Hoogovens, the world&#x27;s largest steel company as of 2013, through a $1 billion bankruptcy bailout. It also implemented a turnaround for the city of Glasgow, which had problems with unemployment and crime. McKinsey created the corporate structure for NationsBank, when it was still a small company known as North Carolina National Bank. McKinsey was hired by General Motors to do a large-scale re-organization to help it compete with Japanese auto-makers. The book &quot;The Firm&quot; said it was an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot; because McKinsey focused on corporate structure, whereas GM needed to compete with Japanese automakers through manufacturing process improvement. A McKinsey consultant said GM did not follow their advice.

A 2002 article in &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; said that a series of bankruptcies of McKinsey clients, such as Swissair, Kmart, and Global Crossing, in the 1990s raised questions as to whether McKinsey was responsible or had a lapse in judgement. McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, many of which were failing. This led to huge losses and bankruptcy for Swissair.

As part of a lawsuit against Allstate, 13,000 McKinsey documents were released, showing that McKinsey recommended that Allstate reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate&#x27;s profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey&#x27;s strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.

===Controversial clients and association with authoritarian regimes===

==== Fossil fuel companies ====
McKinsey works and has worked with many of the largest fossil fuel producing governments and companies. These include; the largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, Shell and BP. The company has stated that “fossil fuels will continue to be a part of the energy mix to meet the world’s energy needs”. McKinsey internal forecasting in 2021 found that emissions from their clients would lead to 3 to 5 degrees of warming, that their client portfolio included “more than half of the world’s worst polluters” and that their work on sustainability projects was “being used to launder the Firm’s reputation”. McKinsey works on the Oil Demand Sustainability Programme” (ODSP), the Saudi Arabia government program designed to increase demand for fossil fuels in poorer countries in Africa and Asia.

====Role in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)====
McKinsey stopped working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after it was disclosed that the firm had done more than $20 million in consulting work for the agency. McKinsey managing partner Kevin Sneader said the contract, not widely known within the company until &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported it, had &quot;rightly raised&quot; concerns. In 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and ProPublica reported on newly uncovered documents which showed that McKinsey, as part of its work with ICE, proposed cuts in spending on food and medical care for migrants. McKinsey also advocated for an acceleration of the deportation process, causing concerns among ICE staff that the due process rights of the migrants would be violated. Previously, McKinsey managing partner, Kevin Sneader, had claimed that McKinsey had done no work for ICE in terms of developing and implementing immigration policy; the uncovered documents showed that to be false.

====Role in Saudi clampdown on dissidents====
In October 2018, in the wake of the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and journalist, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that McKinsey had identified the most prominent Saudi dissidents on Twitter and that the Saudi government subsequently repressed the dissidents and their families. One of the dissidents, Khalid al-Alkami, was arrested. Another dissident identified by McKinsey; Omar Abdulaziz in Canada, had two brothers imprisoned by the Saudi authorities, and his cell phone hacked. McKinsey issued a statement, saying &quot;We are horrified by the possibility, however remote, that [the report] could have been misused. We have seen no evidence to suggest that it was misused, but we are urgently investigating how and with whom the document was shared.&quot; In December 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;the kingdom is a such a vital client for the firm—the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone—that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October 2018 even after the killing and dismemberment of a &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist by Saudi agents.&quot;

On February 12, 2019, the European Parliament Greens/EFA group presented a motion for a resolution on the situation on women&#x27;s rights defenders in Saudi Arabia denouncing the involvement of foreign public relations companies in representing Saudi Arabia and handling its public image, particularly McKinsey &amp; Company.

==== Saudi Arabian influence disclosure ====
In February 2024, McKinsey was questioned in court about possible violations of federal disclosure rules. The company, along with three other consulting firms, was accused of refusing to provide information about their work for Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund and failing to disclose themselves as agents of the Saudi government. Representatives of the firms warned that their staff could face jail if they complied with the subpoenas, breaking strict rules imposed by Saudi Arabia on what information consulting firms can share with the US government.

====Support of authoritarian regimes====
McKinsey&#x27;s business and policy support for authoritarian regimes came under scrutiny in December 2018, in the wake of a lavish company retreat in China held adjacent to prisons where thousands of Uyghurs were being detained without cause. In December 2021, NBC News reported McKinsey&#x27;s connection to a manufacturing facility owned by DJI, a drone maker sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury for alleged complicity in aiding the persecution of Uyghurs in China. In the preceding few years, McKinsey&#x27;s clients included Saudi Arabia&#x27;s absolute monarchy, Turkey&#x27;s autocratic leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ousted former president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych, and several Chinese and Russian companies under sanctions.

====China====
In 2015, McKinsey&#x27;s think tank, the Urban China Initiative, advised the Chinese government on its 13th five-year plan and its Made in China 2025 policy. As part of a project for China&#x27;s National Development and Reform Commission, McKinsey&#x27;s think tank advised the Chinese government to &quot;deepen co-operation between business and the military and push foreign companies out of sensitive industries,&quot; according to a 2024 &quot;Financial Times&quot; report&quot;.&quot; In response, US legislators Marco Rubio and Michael McCaul stated that McKinsey had undermined US security and called for it to be banned from securing US federal government contracts. In October 2024, several US lawmakers called on the United States Department of Justice to investigate whether McKinsey misrepresented its work with Chinese government entities, including state-owned enterprises. On October 18, 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on the CCP reported that &quot;McKinsey Equipped America&#x27;s Foremost Adversary and Misrepresented Work for the Chinese Military Under Oath.&quot;

====Work with Russian arms manufacturers====
McKinsey is reported to have provided consulting services for the Russian state-owned enterprise Rostec, which is responsible for manufacturing missile engines used during Russia&#x27;s war on Ukraine. According to January 2023 reporting from Die Zeit, McKinsey consultants would provide consulting services to Gazprom and Rostec while in Germany on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Defence. According to US Senator Maggie Hassan McKinsey has displayed a &quot;pattern of behavior&quot; that raised &quot;grave concerns about conflicts of interest.&quot; McKinsey has also done work for Sberbank, VTB bank, Gazprom, and Rosneft, which are all closely tied to the Kremlin.

==Controversies==
The firm has been associated with a number of notable scandals, including the collapse of Enron in 2001, the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and facilitating state capture in South Africa. It has also drawn controversy for involvement with Purdue Pharma, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and authoritarian regimes. Michael Forsythe and Walt Bogdanich, reporters for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote a book entitled &quot;When McKinsey Comes to Town&quot; about the controversially unethical work history of the company.

===Enron===

Enron was the creation of Jeff Skilling, a McKinsey consultant of 21 years, who was jailed after Enron reportedly used McKinsey on 20 different projects, and McKinsey consultants had &quot;used Enron as their sandbox.&quot;

Prior to the Enron scandal, McKinsey helped it shift from an oil and gas production company into an electric commodities trader, which led to significant growth in profits and revenues. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, there was &quot;no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, [but] critics say the arrogance of Enron&#x27;s leaders is emblematic of the McKinsey culture.&quot; The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron&#x27;s accounting. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; questioned McKinsey&#x27;s &quot;liability&quot; and its &quot;close relationship with Enron&quot;, and a 2002 &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; article suggested that they had ignored warning signs.

In his July 2002 in-depth &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; article on the aftermath of the Enron scandal, John Bryne wrote that McKinsey had been a &quot;key architect of the strategic thinking that made Enron a Wall Street darling. In books, articles, and essays, its partners regularly stamped their imprimatur on many of Enron&#x27;s strategies and practices, helping to position the energy giant as a corporate innovator worthy of emulation. The firm may not be the subject of any investigations, but its close involvement with Enron raises the question of whether McKinsey, like some other professional firms, ignored warning flags in order to keep an important account.&quot; &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; described how McKinsey&#x27;s culture had changed, as the &quot;number of partners grew from 427 to 891&quot; making it a &quot;less personal place&quot;. According to the article, &quot;some current and former McKinsey consultants&quot; said that McKinsey had lost their &quot;ingrained values&quot; that used to guide the firm. Citing the example of the dot-com bubble, McKinsey had begun to have &quot;less prestigious companies&quot; as clients and had allowed &quot;its focus on building agenda-shaping relationships with top management at leading companies to slip.&quot; As well, &quot;there was a noticeable tilt toward bringing in revenue at the expense of developing knowledge.&quot; McKinsey denied this.

McKinsey denied giving Enron advice on financing issues or having suspicions that Enron was using improper accounting methods.

===2008 financial crisis===

McKinsey is said to have played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis by promoting the securitization of mortgage assets and encouraged the banks to fund their balance sheets with debt, driving up risk, which &quot;poisoned the global financial system and precipitated the 2008 credit meltdown&quot;. Furthermore, McKinsey advised Allstate Insurance to purposely give low offers to claimants. The &quot;Huffington Post&quot; revealed that the strategy was to make claims &quot;so expensive and so time-consuming that lawyers would start refusing to help clients.&quot; Next to this, 2016 McKinsey partner Navdeep Arora was convicted for illegally depleting State Farm of over $500,000 over a period of 8 years, in collaboration with a State Farm employee.

===Valeant===
Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical company investigated by the SEC in 2015, has been accused of improper accounting, and that it used predatory price hikes to boost growth. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; states that &quot;Valeant&#x27;s downfall is not exactly McKinsey&#x27;s fault but its fingerprints are everywhere.&quot; Three out of six senior executives were recent ex-McKinsey employees, as well as the chair of the &#x27;talent and compensation&#x27; committee. MIO Partners was a private investor of Valeant and McKinsey consulted Valeant on drug prices and acquisitions.

===Role in opioid epidemic===

McKinsey advised opioid makers on how to &quot;turbocharge&quot; sales of OxyContin, proposed strategies to counter the emotional messages from mothers with teenagers who overdosed on OxyContin, and helped opioid makers circumvent regulation. The firm also advised Purdue Pharma to offer pharmacies rebates based on the number of overdoses and addictions they caused. In 2019, McKinsey projected that over 2,400 CVS customers would have an overdose or become reliant on opioids. McKinsey estimated that a rebate of $14,810 per &quot;event&quot; would mean that Purdue would have to pay CVS $36.8 million that year. In February 2021, McKinsey reached agreements with attorneys general in 49 states, five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia. Across the settlements, the firm agreed to pay nearly $600 million to settle investigations into its role in promoting sales of OxyContin. McKinsey has since apologized for its advice to opioid makers.

Records show that McKinsey worked for Purdue Pharma and other opioid makers in a 15-year period, from 2004 to 2019. During 2018 and 2019, McKinsey collected at least $400 million consulting pharmaceutical companies. McKinsey advised Mallinckrodt, the largest manufacturer of generic opioids, as well as Endo International for which McKinsey consulted on marketing Opana. McKinsey&#x27;s consultation grew Endo into a leading generics manufacturer. McKinsey recommended targeted and influenced doctors who treat back pain in elderly and long-term care patients.

In February 2021, McKinsey paid $600 million to settle investigations into its role in promoting sales of OxyContin and fueling the greater opioid epidemic.

In April 2022, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that McKinsey had frequently allowed partners and other consultants to work for both government clients, such as the FDA, and pharmaceutical clients, such as Purdue. These actions violated McKinsey&#x27;s own internal ethical guidelines.

In December 2023, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that McKinsey had agreed to pay an additional $78 million to settle claims with health insurers McKinsey&#x27;s consulting helped to fuel &quot;an epidemic of opioid addiction through its work for drug companies.&quot; Reuters reported the settlement would be the last in a series and that McKinsey &quot;admitted to no wrongdoing.&quot; 

In 2024, the company became the subject of a criminal investigation by the US Justice Department into its role in advising opioid manufacturers how to boost sales. A grand jury was convened to determine charges to be brought against the firm. It is also under investigation for obstruction of justice during the period that concerns were mounting about their activities. The firm settled the investigation in December 2024, for a sum of $650 million and with conditions that it cannot market controlled substances for a period of five years. This agreement was filed in federal court in Abingdon, Virginia, with aims to resolve criminal charges which were brought up as part of the latest corporate prosecution concerning the marketing of addictive painkillers. 
===Rikers Island jail complex===
New York City paid McKinsey $27.5 million between 2014 and 2017 to reduce prison assaults in Rikers Island; but the violence grew and the city abandoned many of the firm&#x27;s recommendations.

The consultancy&#x27;s alleged failings included not soliciting the views of inmates or clinic staff; using the encrypted messaging app Wickr that deletes messages, allegedly to avoid transparency; initiatives involving the expanded use of Tasers, shotguns and K9 patrol dogs; replacing troublesome inmates with more accommodating ones in the test area, which skewed the data in favor of the project; the use of ineffective data-analytics software; and spreadsheet errors that inflated the baseline rate of violence, against which the project was measured.

McKinsey advised New York City&#x27;s Rikers Island jail complex and tested an anti-violence strategy named &quot;Restart&quot; which occurred in Rikers housing units. Jail administrators reported that the strategy resulted in violent crimes dropping more than 70% inside the Rikers housing units. Later, it was found that McKinsey consultants and jail officials rigged the program by grouping compliant inmates into the housing units, and that violent crimes including &quot;slashings and stabbings&quot; increased over 1000% from 2011 to 2016.

===Fine for insider trading by investment affiliate===
In February 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a series of articles about McKinsey and the in-house hedge fund it operates – McKinsey Investment Office, or MIO Partners. The articles claimed that there was &quot;potential for undisclosed conflicts of interest between the fund&#x27;s investments and the advice the firm sells to clients&quot;, since the hedge fund could benefit from the inside knowledge obtained through management consulting services.

The firm responded that &quot;MIO and McKinsey employ separate staffs. MIO staff have no nonpublic knowledge of McKinsey clients. For the vast majority of assets under management, decisions about specific investments are made by third-party managers&quot;.

In 2019, McKinsey paid the Justice Department $15 million from fees earned to settle allegations relating to failure to disclose potential conflict in three bankruptcy cases that the firm had advised. In 2021, MIO Partners, an affiliate of McKinsey &amp; Co. that invests almost $31 billion of money on behalf of its employees, was fined $18 million by the US regulator, SEC. The SEC said some of the same people making investment decisions for MIO Partners were McKinsey &amp; Co. employees who had visibility into confidential information for companies for which McKinsey was consulting. The SEC claimed that MIO Partners had advanced knowledge of upcoming mergers, bankruptcy, and financial results announcements for companies that the firm was consulting.

===Accusations of conflicts of interest in US bankruptcies===
In January 2022, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan revived a lawsuit against McKinsey &amp; Co. filed by retired turnaround specialist Jay Alix, accusing the consulting firm of concealing potential conflicts when seeking permission from bankruptcy courts to perform lucrative work on corporate restructurings.

In July 2023, former Prima Wawona CEO Dan Gerawan filed a lawsuit alleging that the investment firm Paine Schwartz used Prima Wawona, then America&#x27;s largest stone fruit producer, to create financial gain for McKinsey and that many of the Paine Schwartz employees were former McKinsey employees. The lawsuit alleges that in late 2020, Paine Schwartz hired McKinsey as consultants, without board approval, to make massive changes in Prima Wawona&#x27;s operations. Thereafter, the company&#x27;s performance deteriorated quickly, according to the suit. Moody&#x27;s downgraded the company&#x27;s outlook from &quot;stable&quot; to &quot;negative.&quot; In October 2023, Prima Wawona filed for bankruptcy. McKinsey was the company&#x27;s largest creditor, owed $8 million. The company was in default on $679 million in debt. Efforts to sell the company in bankruptcy failed. In January 2024, the company announced that it would liquidate, lay off all 5,400 employees, and sell off more than 13,000 acres of farmland.

===Government corruption scandals===
====South African corruption scandal====
The Gupta family (no relation to Rajat Gupta) had strategically placed corrupted individuals in various South African government, utilities and infrastructure sectors. It is alleged that McKinsey was complicit in this corruption by using the Guptas to obtain consulting contracts from certain state-owned enterprises, including Eskom and Transnet. Working with Trillian Capital Partners (a consultancy which was owned by a Gupta associate), they provided services to the value of R1 billion ($75 million) annually. Trillian was paid a commission for facilitating the business for McKinsey. McKinsey hired law firm Norton Rose Fulbright to carry out an internal investigation over the allegations. McKinsey&#x27;s then Managing Partner, Dominic Barton, issued a statement following an internal investigation, in which the firm &quot;admitted that it found violations of its professional standards but denied any acts of bribery, corruption, and payments to Trillian.&quot;

Corruption Watch, a South African non-governmental organization, filed a complaint about the controversial contract to the US Department of Justice, alleging that there was a criminal conspiracy between McKinsey, Trillian and Eskom in contravention of US and South African law. It was revealed in January 2018 that criminal complaints were filed against McKinsey &amp; Company by the South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission. South African prosecutors confirmed that they would enforce the seizing of assets from McKinsey.

South Africa&#x27;s National Prosecuting Authority concluded in early 2018 that the payments to McKinsey and its local business partner, Trillian, were illegal, involving crimes such as fraud, theft, corruption and money laundering. McKinsey had subsequently been in discussion with Eskom and the National Prosecuting Authority&#x27;s Asset Forfeiture Unit to agree on a transparent, legally appropriate process for returning the R 1 billion (US$74M) it had been paid – it was confirmed on 6 July 2018 that this had been concluded. Eskom confirmed it received R99.5M in interest from McKinsey on July 23, 2018. The interest payment covers the two years since McKinsey was paid almost R 1bn in 2016.

Information relating to allegedly corrupt practices by McKinsey at Transnet in 2011 and 2012 came to light in late July 2018. The weekly &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; newspaper reported that a &quot;...new forensic treasury report shows how controversial former Transnet and Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh enjoyed overseas trips at the expense of international consulting firm McKinsey, which scored multi-billion rand contracts at the state owned entities.&quot; The &quot;...report reiterates treasury&#x27;s recommendations that Singh&#x27;s conduct with regards to McKinsey should be referred to the elite crime-fighting unit, the Hawks, for investigations under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act (Precca). Under Precca, Singh would be investigated for allegations of corruption as payment for the overseas trips alone would constitute a form of gratification, which is illegal.&quot; The Sunday &quot;City Press&quot; reported that the forensic report in turn reported that &quot;multinational advisory firm McKinsey paid for Singh to go on lavish international trips to Dubai, Russia, Germany and the UK, after which their contract with Transnet was massively extended.&quot; McKinsey issued a statement that the allegations were incorrect. McKinsey stated that &quot;based on an extensive review encompassing interviews, email records and expense documents, our understanding is that McKinsey did not pay for Mr. Singh&#x27;s airfare and hotel lodgings in connection with the CFO Forum and the meetings that took place around the CFO Forum in London and elsewhere in 2012 and 2013.&quot; On 11 October 2019, the United States Treasury department announced that it had imposed wide-ranging financial sanctions on three Gupta brothers, Ajay, Atul and Rajesh (aka Tony) and their business associate Salim Essa under the United States Magnitsky Act.

&quot;The Economist&quot; reported in November 2019, that McKinsey&#x27;s scandals, such as the 2016 South Africa scandal and the allegations of conflict of interest tied to its $12.7bn investment affiliate, McKinsey Investment Office (MIO), are relatively recent in terms of its long history. The article said that McKinsey&#x27;s legal challenges facing McKinsey&#x27;s new global managing partner, Kevin Sneader, may be related to the company&#x27;s fast-paced growth with an increase of 2,200 partners compared to 2009. During that same time period, the number of employees increased to 30,000 worldwide from 17,000.

In 2020, McKinsey representatives giving testimony to the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture placed blame for the firm&#x27;s involvement in the corruption scandal on former McKinsey partner, Vikas Sagar. During 2021 McKinsey &amp; Co. agreed to repay R 870 million (US$63M) in fees to South African state logistics company Transnet SOC Ltd., seeking to distance itself from contracts linked to corruption allegations. In April 2022 the Zondo Commission recommended that key Eskom executives be criminally investigated for improperly awarding consulting contracts to McKinsey &amp; Company.

South Africa&#x27;s National Prosecuting Authority announced on Friday, 30 September 2022 that it had criminally charged both McKinsey South Africa and former McKinsey partner, Vikas Sagar, with fraud, corruption and theft related to a contract to advise Transnet on buying new locomotives.

In 2024, McKinsey was ordered to pay a $122 million criminal penalty (and enter into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement) to settle an investigation by the Justice Department and South Africa&#x27;s National Prosecuting Authority for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA); 50% of the penalty will be paid to South Africa (roughly R1.1 billion). McKinsey paid bribes to government officials in South Africa between 2012 and 2016.

====French presidential corruption scandal====
In December 2022, it was reported that the French National Financial Prosecutors&#x27; Office had raided the headquarters of President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s Renaissance party and McKinsey&#x27;s Paris office. The raids were related to probes into false election campaign accounting, as well as possible favouritism and conspiracy. The probe had been widened in October 2022 from an initial focus on McKinsey&#x27;s taxes to include alleged underreporting of campaign consulting costs and allegations of favoritism. Even though the company had a turn over of €329 million, they did not pay any corporation taxes in France in a decade, according to the French senate. McKinsey consultants are alleged to have worked as unpaid volunteers on Macron&#x27;s 2017 and 2022 election campaigns, in violation of French law. The firm is subsequently alleged to have benefitted from special access and favorable government treatment, including the awarding of lucrative government contracts. The French media has dubbed the scandal &#x27;McKinsey Affair&#x27; or &#x27;McKinseygate&#x27;. McKinsey is facing possible charges for corruption and tax fraud as a result of the investigation. In July 2023, the case was still pending.

====Canadian government consulting scandal====

A January 2023 investigative report by CBC News revealed that Justin Trudeau&#x27;s government had spent at least $117.4 million on McKinsey consulting since coming to power, compared to $2.2 million spent by the prior government. According to documents obtained by Radio-Canada, all of those contracts were sole-source, meaning other firms were not given the chance to bid for the contracts. Further investigative reporting identified at least $84 million in McKinsey consulting expenses between March 2021 and November 2022 alone.

According to anonymous sources with major roles at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), McKinsey is reported to have a particularly large and growing influence over Canadian immigration policy. Policy is reported to have been decided on without input from public servants, and with minimal consideration for the public interest. Canada&#x27;s immigration targets have closely followed goals set in a plan by previous McKinsey head Dominic Barton, who outlined these plans in his 2016 report of the Advisory Council on Economic Growth and through his work with the Century Initiative. Both the report and the Century Initiative advocate for a steep increase in immigration to bring Canada&#x27;s population to 100 million by 2100. According to one of the IRCC whistleblowers, the department was informed that Barton&#x27;s report was a &quot;foundational plan&quot; in spite of reservations expressed by the then-immigration minister, John McCallum.

On January 10, 2023, Canadian opposition parties, including the Conservative Party of Canada, the New Democratic Party of Canada, and Bloc Quebecois, called for a parliamentary inquiry into federal contracts awarded to McKinsey. The opposition is demanding that the government disclose &quot;contracts, conversations, records of work done, meetings held, text messages, email exchanges, everything that the government has with the company since taking office&quot;. McKinsey has thus far refused to answer CBC News questions regarding its role and agreements with the federal government, while the government has refused to provide copies of the company&#x27;s reports. In response to the controversy, McKinsey issued a statement on its website indicating that it &quot;welcomes the opportunity&quot; to provide information to parliament, and that it &quot;does not make policy recommendations on immigration or any other topic&quot;.

Trudeau asked fellow Liberal Party members Treasury Board President Mona Fortier and Procurement Minister Helena Jaczek to review the contracts return a final report. On 23 March 2023, the Treasury Board announced that audits had determined that departments did not consistently follow certain administrative rules and procedures, but that there was &quot;broad compliance with values and ethics commitments.&quot; According to the Treasury Board, while the audits raised questions about fairness, transparency and conflicts of interest, no evidence was found of political direction in awarding the contracts.

=== Climate change ===

==== Climate action letter and AMC ====
In 2021, more than 1,100 McKinsey employees signed a letter calling out the firm for working with 43 of the 100 most polluting companies. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, these 43 clients alone were responsible for more than a third of the world&#x27;s carbon emissions in 2018. The letter called on the firm to disclose how much carbon its clients emit. McKinsey executives said they would continue to advise major carbon polluters. Several employees resigned from the firm following the letter.

In April 2022, McKinsey, Alphabet Inc., Shopify, Meta Platforms, and Stripe, Inc. announced a $925 million advance market commitment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from companies that are developing CDR technology over the next 9 years.

==== 2023 Africa Climate Summit ====
More than 400 civil society groups signed a letter of protest to Kenyan President William Ruto, accusing McKinsey of influencing the 2023 Africa Climate Summit. The letter claimed that the agenda for the summit, as proposed by McKinsey, &quot;reflects the interests of the US, McKinsey and the Western corporations they represent.&quot; Leaked documents revealed that the consulting firm tried to push controversial carbon market schemes that would benefit its fossil fuel clients.

==== COP28 ====

In 2023, an AFP investigation revealed in multiple leaked documents that McKinsey was using its position as primary advisor to COP28 hosts, the United Arab Emirates, to push the interest of its oil and gas clients (ExxonMobil and Aramco). McKinsey has been accused of putting its own interests ahead of the climate by sources involved in preparatory meetings for COP28. McKinsey&#x27;s energy scenario for the COP28 presidency would allow for continued investment in fossil fuels, which would undermine the goals of the Paris Agreement; an &quot;energy transition narrative&quot; recommends oil use to be reduced by only 50% by 2050, and that trillions of dollars should continue to be invested in high-emission assets each year to at least 2050.

=== Diversity, equity, and inclusion ===
McKinsey &amp; Company published several reports on business benefits of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The reports were criticized as insufficiently investigating the difference between correlation and causality, lacking robustness, and overgeneralizing to broad claims.

=== McKinsey Partner Rachel Riley and DOGE ===
In January of 2025, McKinsey Partner Rachel Riley joined the Department of Government Efficiency, an organization headed by Elon Musk widely blamed for undermining U.S. democracy.

<doc id="642330" wikidata="Q15994658" url="?curid=642330" title="Newtonian dynamics">
<text>In physics, Newtonian dynamics (also known as Newtonian mechanics) is the study of the dynamics of a particle or a small body according to Newton&#x27;s laws of motion.

==Mathematical generalizations==
Typically, the Newtonian dynamics occurs in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, which is flat. However, in mathematics Newton&#x27;s laws of motion can be generalized to multidimensional and curved spaces. Often the term Newtonian dynamics is narrowed to Newton&#x27;s second law formula_1.

==Newton&#x27;s second law in a multidimensional space==
Consider formula_2 particles with masses formula_3 in the regular three-dimensional Euclidean space. Let formula_4 be their radius-vectors in some inertial coordinate system. Then the motion of these particles is governed by Newton&#x27;s second law applied to each of them

The three-dimensional radius-vectors formula_5 can be built into a single formula_6-dimensional radius-vector. Similarly, three-dimensional velocity vectors formula_7 can be built into a single formula_6-dimensional velocity vector:

In terms of the multidimensional vectors () the equations () are written as 

i.e. they take the form of Newton&#x27;s second law applied to a single particle with the unit mass formula_9.

Definition. The equations () are called the
equations of a Newtonian dynamical system in a flat multidimensional Euclidean space, which is called the configuration space of this system. Its points are marked by the radius-vector 
formula_10. The space whose points are marked by the pair of vectors formula_11 is called the phase space of the dynamical system ().

==Euclidean structure==
The configuration space and the phase space of the dynamical system () both are Euclidean spaces, i. e. they are equipped with a Euclidean structure. The Euclidean structure of them is defined so that the kinetic energy of the single multidimensional particle with the unit mass formula_9 is equal to the sum of kinetic energies of the three-dimensional particles with the masses formula_3:
==Constraints and internal coordinates==
In some cases the motion of the particles with the masses formula_3 can be constrained. Typical constraints look like scalar equations of the form 

Constraints of the form () are called holonomic and scleronomic. In terms of the radius-vector formula_10 of the Newtonian dynamical system () they are written as

Each such constraint reduces by one the number of degrees of freedom of the Newtonian dynamical system (). Therefore, the constrained system has formula_16 degrees of freedom.

Definition. The constraint equations () define an formula_17-dimensional manifold formula_18 within the configuration space of the Newtonian dynamical system (). This manifold formula_18 is called the configuration space of the constrained system. Its tangent bundle formula_20 is called the phase space of the constrained system.

Let formula_21 be the internal coordinates of a point of formula_18. Their usage is typical for the Lagrangian mechanics. The radius-vector formula_10 is expressed as some definite function of formula_21:

The vector-function () resolves the constraint equations () in the sense that upon substituting () into () the equations () are fulfilled identically in formula_21.

==Internal presentation of the velocity vector==
The velocity vector of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system is expressed in terms of the partial derivatives of the vector-function

The quantities formula_26 are called internal components of the velocity vector. Sometimes they are denoted with the use of a separate symbol

and then treated as independent variables. The quantities

are used as internal coordinates of a point of the phase space formula_20 of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system.

==Embedding and the induced Riemannian metric==
Geometrically, the vector-function () implements an embedding of the configuration space formula_18 of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system into the formula_29-dimensional flat configuration space of the unconstrained 
Newtonian dynamical system (). Due to this embedding the Euclidean structure of the ambient space induces the Riemannian metric onto the manifold formula_18. The components of the metric tensor of this induced metric are given by the formula

where formula_31 is the scalar product associated with the Euclidean structure ().

==Kinetic energy of a constrained Newtonian dynamical system==
Since the Euclidean structure of an unconstrained system of formula_2 particles is introduced through their kinetic energy, the induced Riemannian structure on the configuration space formula_2 of a constrained system preserves this relation to the kinetic energy:

The formula () is derived by substituting () into () and taking into account ().

==Constraint forces==

For a constrained Newtonian dynamical system the constraints described by the equations () are usually implemented by some mechanical framework. This framework produces some auxiliary forces including the force that maintains the system within its configuration manifold formula_18. Such a maintaining force is perpendicular to formula_18. It is called the normal force. The force formula_36 from () is subdivided into two components

The first component in () is tangent to the configuration manifold formula_18. The second component is perpendicular to formula_18. In coincides with the normal force formula_39.&lt;br&gt;
Like the velocity vector (), the tangent force 
formula_40 has its internal presentation

The quantities formula_41 in () are called the internal components of the force vector.

==Newton&#x27;s second law in a curved space==
The Newtonian dynamical system () constrained to the configuration manifold formula_18 by the constraint equations () is described by the differential equations

where formula_43 are Christoffel symbols of the metric connection produced by the Riemannian metric ().

==Relation to Lagrange equations==
Mechanical systems with constraints are usually described by Lagrange equations:

where formula_44 is the kinetic energy the constrained dynamical system given by the formula (). The quantities formula_45 in 
() are the inner covariant components of the tangent force vector formula_46 (see () and ()). They are produced from the inner contravariant components formula_41 of the vector formula_46 by means of the standard index lowering procedure using the metric ():

The equations () are equivalent to the equations (). However, the metric () and
other geometric features of the configuration manifold formula_18 are not explicit in (). The metric () can be recovered from the kinetic energy formula_50 by means of the formula

<text>The brahminy starling or brahminy myna (&quot;Sturnia pagodarum)&quot; is a member of the starling family of birds. It is usually seen in pairs or small flocks in open habitats on the plains of the Indian subcontinent.

==Taxonomy==
The brahminy starling was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus pagodarum&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;pagodarum&quot; is Modern Latin meaning &quot;of the temples&quot; or &quot;of the pagodas&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;Le Martin Brame&quot; that had been described in 1782 by the French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat in his book &quot;Voyage aux Indes orientales et à la Chine&quot;. Sonnerat mentioned that the bird was found on the Malabar and Coromandel Coasts of India.

The brahminy starling was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Sturnus&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 found that the genus was polyphyletic. In the reoganization to create monotypic genera, the brahminy starling was one of five starlings moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Sturnia&quot; that had been introduced in 1837 by René Lesson. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
This myna is pale buff creamy with a black cap and a loose crest. The bill is yellow with a bluish base. The iris is pale and there is a bluish patch of skin around the eye. The outer tail feathers have white and the black primaries of the wings do not have any white patches. The adult male has a more prominent crest than the female and also has longer neck hackles. Juveniles are duller and the cap is browner.

The species name &quot;pagodarum&quot; is thought to be based on occurrence of the species on buildings and temple pagodas in southern India.

==Distribution and habitat==

It is a resident breeder in Nepal and India, a winter visitor to Sri Lanka and a summer visitor in parts of the western and northeastern Himalayas. They are spotted in the plains of Pakistan as well. They have musical call notes that are long, made up of a series of slurred notes that end abruptly. Although mainly seen on the plains, there are a few records from above 3,000m, mainly from Ladakh.

This passerine is typically found in dry forest, scrub jungle and cultivation and is often found close to human habitations. They especially favour areas with waterlogged or marshy lands.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
Like most starlings, the brahminy starling is omnivorous, eating fruit and insects. They have been known to feed on the fruits of &quot;Thevetia peruviana&quot; which are toxic to many vertebrates. These birds are not as arboreal as the grey-headed mynas and they form small flocks that mix with other mynas on grass covered ground. They sometimes forage beside grazing cattle. They also visit flowers for nectar, particularly &quot;Salmalia&quot;, &quot;Butea monosperma&quot; and &quot;Erythrina&quot;. They roost communally in large numbers in leafy trees, often in the company of parakeets and other mynas.

===Breeding===
It builds its nest in tree holes or artificial cavities. The breeding season is March to September but varies with location, being earlier in southern India. The season coincides with the fruiting of many plants and the young hatch just as the rains begin. The male selects the nest, sometimes having to compete with other hole-nesters such as barbets and sparrows. The male displays by puffing up feathers, fanning the tail, erecting the crest and raising up its bill. Both sexes take part in nest building. The nest is lined with grass, feathers and rags. The normal clutch is three to four eggs which are pale bluish green. The females do not add replacement eggs when eggs are removed nor do they stop laying if an egg is artificially added. Incubation begins only after laying the second egg with the female brooding at night with the male share limited to brief periods during the day. The eggs hatch in about 12 to 14 days. The young fledge and leave the nest when they are three weeks old. The young are fed with insects in the early stages and grains in the later stages. After feeding the parents wait for the young to eject faecal pellets which they carefully remove and drop about away from the nest. Two or three broods may be raised in succession.

<text>The ten Attic orators were considered the greatest Greek orators and logographers of the classical era (5th–4th century BC). They are included in the &quot;Canon of Ten&quot;, which probably originated in Alexandria. A.E. Douglas has argued, however, that it was not until the second century AD that the canon took on the form that is recognised today.

==Alexandrian &quot;Canon of Ten&quot;==
* Aeschines
* Andocides
* Antiphon
* Demosthenes
* Dinarchus
* Hypereides
* Isaeus
* Isocrates
* Lycurgus
* Lysias

As far as Homer (8th or 9th century BC), the art of effective speaking was of considerable value in Greece. In Homer&#x27;s epic, the &quot;Iliad,&quot; the warrior, Achilles, was described as &quot;a speaker of words and a doer of deeds&quot;.

Until the 5th century BC, however, oratory was not formally taught. It was not until the middle of that century that the Sicilian orator, Corax, along with his pupil, Tisias, began a formal study of rhetoric. In 427 BC, another Sicilian named Gorgias of Leontini visited Athens and gave a speech which dazzled the citizens. Gorgias’s &quot;intellectual&quot; approach to oratory, which included new ideas, forms of expression, and methods of argument, was continued by Isocrates, a 4th-century BC educator and rhetorician. Oratory eventually became a central subject of study in the formalized Greek education system.

The work of the Attic orators inspired the later rhetorical movement of Atticism, an approach to speech composition in a simple rather than ornate style.

<doc id="642338" wikidata="Q2114111" url="?curid=642338" title="Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade">
<text>The East Tyrone Brigade of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), also known as the Tyrone/Monaghan Brigade was one of the most active republican paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland during &quot;the Troubles&quot;. It is believed to have drawn its membership from across the eastern side of County Tyrone as well as north County Monaghan and south County Londonderry.

==List of notable actions from 1971 until Loughgall==
Dates highlighted in bold indicate three or more fatalities.
*14 September 1971: a British soldier (John Rudman, aged 21) was shot dead while on mobile patrol, Edendork, near Coalisland, County Tyrone. He was the first British soldier killed by the East Tyrone Brigade
*14 March 1972: A two-man IRA unit armed with sub-machine guns ambushed a joint British Army/RUC patrol on Brackaville Road outside Coalisland. Over 50 shots were fired by the unit. The RUC officer, William Logan (aged 23), who was driving the police patrol vehicle was mortally wounded and died the following day, he was the first RUC officer killed by the brigade.
*10 September 1972: Douglas Richmond (21), Duncan McPhee (21) and William McIntyre (23), all members of the British Army, were killed in an IRA land mine attack on their armoured personnel carrier, at Sanaghanroe, near Dungannon.

*2 May 1974: Up to 40 members from the IRA&#x27;s East Tyrone Brigade attacked the isolated 6 UDR Deanery base in Clogher, County Tyrone with machine gun and RPG fire resulting in the death of Private Eva Martin, a UDR Greenfinch, the first female UDR soldier to be killed by enemy action. See: Attack on UDR Clogher barracks
*13 May 1974: Eugene Martin (18) and Sean McKearney (19), both Catholic members of the IRA, were killed in a premature explosion, while planting a bomb at a petrol filling station at Donnydeade.
*22 September 1974: A helicopter came under fire while flying along the Tyrone-Monaghan border and was forced to land in a field. An IRA statement claimed the 3rd Battalion of the East Tyrone Brigade was responsible.

*7 February 1976: Two Protestant teenagers, Rachel and Robert McLernon (aged 18 and 16, respectively), were killed by an IRA booby-trap bomb, intended for members of the security forces, which had been hidden in an abandoned crashed car, Tyresson Road, Cookstown.
*29 April 1976 – Edmund Stewart (31), Protestant off duty member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, and Stanley Arthurs (43), a Protestant civilian, were shot dead by the IRA at Arthurs’ farm at Dunamony.
*2 June 1977: Three members of a RUC mobile patrol were shot dead by East Tyrone Brigade snipers near Ardboe.
*3 December 1977: RUC car ambushed by IRA gunmen firing automatic weapons at Clover Hill Bridge on Benburb Road near Moy, County Tyrone. Firefight ensued and the assailants fled across fields.
* 26 February 1978: IRA Volunteer Paul Duffy was killed by the SAS in Coagh.
*16 December 1979: William Beck (23), Keith Richards (22), Simon Evans (19) and Allan Ayrton (21), all members of the British Army, were killed in an IRA land mine attack on their mobile patrol at Ballygawley Road near Dungannon
*21 January 1981: Sir Norman Stronge (86), Ulster Unionist Party member, and former Speaker at Stormont, and his son, James Stronge (48), an off-duty member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary reserve, both aristocratic Protestants, were shot dead by the Provisional Irish Republican Army at their mansion, Tynan Abbey, Tynan. A group of men in military style uniform forced their way into the abbey, a mansion in its own large grounds near the Border, sought out the father and son, and shot them. They then placed bombs and incendiary devices and set the mansion alight. It was destroyed by the fire. Sir Norman Stronge, one of the oldest people killed during The Troubles, had been Stormont MP for Mid-Armagh from 1938 to 1969, and Speaker of the House from 1945 until his retirement. James Stronge had taken over the Mid-Armagh seat in 1969 and held it until 1972. He had been a Unionist member of the NI Assembly from 1973 to 1974. Both father and son were members of Derryhaw Boyne Defenders Orange Lodge. The IRA claimed the Stronges had been targeted as &quot;symbols of hated unionism&quot; and &quot;as a direct reprisal for a whole series of loyalist assassinations and murder attacks&quot;.
*7 September 1981: two RUC officers (Mark Evans and Stuart Montgomery) were killed when their patrol vehicle struck an IRA landmine at Sessadonaghy, near Cappagh, County Tyrone.
*13 July 1983: four UDR soldiers (Ronald Alexander, Thomas Harron, Oswell Neely, and John Roxborough) were killed in a land mine attack while on mobile patrol, near Ballygawley. See: Ballygawley land mine attack
*12 November 1983: a RUC officer (Paul Clarke) was killed and several others were injured in an IRA mortar bomb attack on Carrickmore British Army/Royal Ulster Constabulary base.
*4 December 1983: Colm McGirr (23) and Brian Campbell (19), both members of the East Tyrone Brigade, were shot dead by an undercover British Army soldier whilst approaching an arms dump in a field near Coalisland.
*13 July 1984: IRA Volunteer Willie Price was killed by the SAS while carrying out an incendiary bomb attack on a factory in Ardboe.
*7 December 1985: during an attack on the RUC barracks in Ballygawley, the IRA killed two RUC officers (Reserve Constable William Clements and Constable George Gilliland) and destroyed the barracks with a large bomb. IRA volunteers had been lying in wait outside the barracks and, as the officers left, two gunmen stepped out of concealed positions and shot both officers in the head from close range. Another IRA unit then directed heavy machine-gun fire at the front of the barracks, which provided cover for a bomb team to plant a 100 lb (45 kg) bomb inside. The bomb exploded ten minutes later, destroying the barracks. Three other RUC officers who were in the building fled through a back door. See: Attack on Ballygawley barracks
*11 December 1985: the East Tyrone Brigade claimed responsibility for mortaring Tynan RUC base, County Armagh in which four RUC officers were injured and the base badly damaged.
*11 August 1986: The East Tyrone Brigade destroyed the RUC base at The Birches near Portadown with a 200 lb bomb. Three civilians were injured in the attack. See: Attack on RUC Birches barracks
*23 November 1986: six British soldiers were wounded after the Brigade launched seven mortars at a British Army barracks in Middletown, County Armagh just along the Armagh/Monaghan border.
*26 January 1987: a senior UDR officer was killed outside his home on Coalisland Road, Dungannon. Major George Shaw, a 57-year-old father of two, worked full-time for the MOD and was a part-time soldier. Early in the morning as he prepared to drive to work, two masked IRA gunmen who had been hiding behind trees walked over and shot him three times in the head, mortally wounding him. Almost immediately another part-time soldier chanced upon the scene and opened fire on the fleeing gunmen who managed to escape by forcing a passing car to stop and raced off. Major Shaw died at the scene.
*25 April 1987: an off duty British soldier (William Graham) was shot dead by the IRA at his family&#x27;s farm, off Gortscraheen Road, near Pomeroy. This was the last action by the Brigade before Loughgall.

==Lynagh&#x27;s strategy==
In the 1980s, the IRA in East Tyrone and other areas close to the border, such as South Armagh, were following a Maoist military theory devised for Ireland by Jim Lynagh, a high-profile member of the IRA in East Tyrone (but a native of County Monaghan). The theory involved creating &quot;no-go zones&quot; that the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not control and gradually expanding them. Lynagh&#x27;s strategy was to start off with one area which the British military did not control, preferably a republican stronghold such as east Tyrone. The South Armagh area was considered to be a liberated zone already, since British troops and the RUC could not use the roads there for fear of roadside bombs and long-range harassing fire. Thus it was from there that the IRA East Tyrone Brigade attacks were launched, with most of them occurring in east Tyrone in areas close to south Armagh, which offered good escape routes. The first phase of Lynagh&#x27;s plan to drive out the British security forces from east Tyrone involved destroying isolated rural police stations and then intimidating or killing any building contractors who were employed to rebuild them. Lynagh&#x27;s plans met strong criticism from senior brigade member Kevin McKenna, who regarded the strategy as &quot;too impractical, too ambitious, and not sustainable&quot; according to journalist Ed Moloney. The IRA Northern Command, however, approved a scaled-down version of the strategy, aimed at hampering the repair and refurbishment of British security bases. Scottish-born journalist Kevin Toolis has written that from 1985 onward, the brigade led a five-year campaign that left 33 security facilities destroyed and nearly 100 seriously damaged.
In July 1983, the East Tyrone Brigade carried out a landmine ambush on an Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) mobile patrol near Ballygawley, killing three UDR soldiers (a fourth UDR soldier died later). In 1985 and 1986, the East Tyrone Brigade carried out two attacks on RUC bases in their operational area, described by author Mark Urban as &quot;spectaculars&quot;. The first was an assault on Ballygawley base in December 1985. Two RUC officers were shot dead and the base was raked with gunfire before being destroyed by a bomb. The second was an attack on the part-time base at The Birches, County Armagh, in August 1986. The base was raked with gunfire and a JCB digger with a 200 lb (91 kg) bomb in its bucket was driven through the perimeter fence. The bomb detonated, destroying much of the base and damaging nearby buildings. In April 1987 the brigade shot and killed Harold Henry, one of the main building contractors to the security forces in Northern Ireland.

==Loughgall ambush==
On 8 May 1987, at least eight members of the brigade launched another attack on the unmanned Loughgall RUC base. The IRA unit used the same tactics as it had done in The Birches attack. It destroyed a substantial part of the base with a 200 lb bomb and raked the building with gunfire. However, as their attack was underway, the IRA unit was ambushed by a Special Air Service (SAS) unit. The SAS shot dead eight IRA members and a civilian who had accidentally driven into the ambush. This was the IRA&#x27;s greatest loss of life in a single incident since the days of the Anglo-Irish War (1919–1922). Six IRA members from a supporting unit managed to escape. The Volunteers killed at Loughgall were Declan Arthurs (21), Tony Gormley (24), Eugene Kelly (25), Pádraig McKearney (32), Jim Lynagh (31), Gerard O&#x27;Callaghan (28), Seamus Donnelly (19) and unit commander Patrick Joseph Kelly (30). The eight volunteers killed in the ambush became known as the &quot;Loughgall Martyrs&quot; among many republicans.

In December 2011, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)&#x27;s Historical Enquiries Team found that not only did the IRA team fire first but that they could not have been safely arrested. They concluded that the SAS were justified in opening fire.

In 2012 a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in Tyrone distanced itself from a republican commemoration of those killed in the ambush. This was in response to a complaint from Democratic Unionist Party Assemblyman William McCrea accusing the GAA of turning a blind eye to &quot;republican terrorist&quot; events in the last years. GAA Central Council official reply was that &quot;The GAA has strict protocols and rules in place regarding the use of property for Political purposes. (...) The Association is committed to a shared future based on tolerance for the different identities and cultural backgrounds of people who share this Community and this island.&quot;

==Subsequent brigade activity==

===In the aftermath of the Loughgall ambush===

The SAS ambush had no noticeable long-term effect on the level of IRA activity in East Tyrone. The level of IRA activity in the area did not show any real decline in the aftermath: in the two years before the Loughgall ambush the IRA killed seven people in East Tyrone and North Armagh, and eleven in the two years following the ambush. Additionally, most of the attacks which took place in County Fermanagh during this period of the Troubles were also launched from south Tyrone and Monaghan. However, many of their remaining members were young and inexperienced and fell into further ambushes, leading to high casualties by the standards of the low intensity guerrilla conflict in Northern Ireland. Ed Moloney, Irish journalist and author of the &quot;Secret History of the IRA&quot;, states that the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade lost 53 members killed in the Troubles, the highest of any rural Brigade area. Of these, 28 were killed between 1987 and 1992.

A major IRA attack in County Tyrone took place on 20 August 1988, barely a year after Loughall, which ended in the deaths of eight soldiers when a British Army bus was destroyed by a bomb at Curr Road, near Ballygawley. The soldiers were being transported from RAF Aldergrove to a military base near Omagh after returning from leave in England. This attack forced the British military to ferry their troops to and from East Tyrone by helicopter. On 30 August 1988, an SAS ambush killed IRA members Gerard Harte, Martin Harte and Brian Mullin as they tried to kill an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment member near Carrickmore. According to author Nick Van der Bijl, British intelligence identified them as the perpetrators of the bombing of the military bus at Curr Road. Peter Taylor, instead, says that only Mullin was suspected, and that plans for the SAS operation were already underway at the time of the IRA roadside bomb attack. On 16 September 1989, a British sergeant of the Royal Corps of Signals (Kevin Froggett) was shot and killed by an IRA sniper while he was repairing a radio mast at Coalisland Army/RUC base.

According to journalist Ed Moloney, Michael &quot;Pete&quot; Ryan (himself killed with two other IRA volunteers on 3 June 1991), an alleged top Brigade member, was the commander of the IRA flying column that launched the attack on Derryard checkpoint in Fermanagh on 13 December 1989. British military sources reported that other IRA volunteers from East Tyrone were involved in the assault. The checkpoint was stormed using an improvised armoured truck and two British soldiers (James Houston and Michael Patterson) were killed in action. Journalist Ian Bruce claims that an unidentified Irishman who had served in the Parachute Regiment was the leader of the IRA unit, citing intelligence sources.

===From 1990 to the 1994 IRA ceasefire===
====Operations against British security forces in east and south Tyrone====
===== 1990–1992 =====

====== Main actions ======
On 11 February 1990 the brigade managed to shoot down a British Army Gazelle helicopter near Clogher by machine gun fire and wounding three soldiers, one of them seriously. The helicopter was hit between Clogher and Augher, over the border near Derrygorry, across the border. The Gazelle broke up during the subsequent crash-landing.

On 4 March 1990, ten IRA volunteers launched an assault on the RUC station at Stewartstown using an improvised flamethrower consisting of a manure-spreader towed by a tractor to spray of a petrol/diesel mix to set the base ablaze, and then opened up with rifles and an RPG-7 rocket launcher. The next day the IRA threatened any contractor who took on repair of the station.

On 24 March 1990, there was a gun battle between an IRA unit and undercover British forces in the main street of the village of Cappagh, County Tyrone, in which IRA members fired at a civilian-type car driven by security forces, according to Archie Hamilton, then Secretary of State for Defence. Hamilton stated that there were no security or civilian casualties. &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; claimed the IRA men thwarted an ambush and at least two SAS members were killed. A second shooting took place in the village of Pomeroy on 28 June, this time against British regular troops. One soldier was seriously wounded.

On 5 September 1990, an &quot;engineering&quot; IRA unit from the Tyrone Brigade, supported by armed militants, planted a massive car bomb outside the RUC barracks at Loughgall. A warning was delivered, and the device exploded after midnight, causing extensive damage to the base.

On 1 January 1991, a British Army checkpoint was fired on by an IRA unit at Aughnacloy. On 26 March, an IRA unit firing a light machine gun disrupted a UDR mobile checkpoint at Lurgylea road, north of Cappagh. No casualties were reported.

On 31 January 1992, an IRA van bomb blew up in downtown Dungannon, resulting in three people wounded and severe property damage to the city centre and to the RUC/Army base.

====== Last SAS ambushes ======
In October 1990, two IRA volunteers from the brigade (Dessie Grew and Martin McCaughey) were shot dead near Loughgall by SAS undercover members while allegedly collecting two rifles from an IRA arms dump.

On 3 June 1991, three IRA men, Lawrence McNally, Michael &quot;Pete&quot; Ryan, and Tony Doris, died in another SAS ambush at Coagh, where their car was riddled with gunfire. Ryan, according to Moloney, had led the mixed flying column under direct orders of top IRA Army Council member Thomas &quot;Slab&quot; Murphy two years before. The RUC stated the men were on their way to mount an ambush on Protestant workmen.

Another four IRA members were killed in an ambush in February 1992. The four, Peter Clancy, Kevin Barry O&#x27;Donnell, Sean O&#x27;Farrell and Patrick Vincent, were killed at Clonoe after an attack on the RUC station in Coalisland. O&#x27;Donnell had been released without charges for possession of weapons on two different occasions in the past. They had mounted a heavy DShK machine gun on the back of a stolen lorry, driven right to the RUC/British Army station and opened fire with tracer ammunition at the fortified base at point-blank range, no efforts were made to conceal the firing position or the machine gun. After the shooting they drove past the house of Tony Doris, the IRA man killed the previous year, where they fired more shots in the air and were heard to shout, &quot;Up the &#x27;RA, that&#x27;s for Tony Doris&quot;. A support vehicle further compromised the getaway by flashing its emergency lights. Six attackers gathered on the same spot afterwards. The IRA men were intercepted by the SAS as they were trying to dump the lorry and escape in cars in the car park of Clonoe Roman Catholic church, whose roof was set on fire by Army flares. Two IRA men escaped from the scene, but the four named above were killed. One British soldier was wounded. Author Brendan O&#x27;Brien reports a witness claiming that some of the men were wounded and tried to surrender but were killed by the British soldiers. Patrick Vincent was shot in the cab of the lorry whilst Kevin Barry O&#x27;Donnell and Peter Clancy were shot just outside. Sean O&#x27;Farrell was wounded and attempted to escape. After being caught he was put up against a fence and killed.

According to a British intelligence officer, from then on, the brigade change tactics and resorted mostly to mortar attacks on security bases, while the British Army reinforced their patrols around the main urban centres in the county.

===== 1992–1994 =====
====== Main actions ======
In March 1992, members of the brigade destroyed McGowan&#x27;s service station along the Ballygawley-Dungannon road with a bomb, on the basis that they were supplying British forces, while a soldier was wounded in the arms by a tripwire bomb at Flavour Royal, near Augher, and had to be airlifted.

A part-time RUC barracks at Fivemiletown, County Tyrone, in the operational area of the brigade, was destroyed by an IRA tractor-bomb on 7 May 1992, though the attack was claimed by the South Fermanagh Brigade. In the aftermath of the bombing, on 9 May, a sergeant mayor of the 1st Battalion, the Staffordshire Regiment was shot and killed by a soldier of his company in a blue-on-blue incident at the same spot, while taking part of a security detail around the devastated base. According to a later IRA&#x27;s statement, the destruction of the security base forced the RUC and the British Army to organised their patrols from nearby RUC barracks at Clogher, allowing the East Tyrone Brigade to study their pattern and carry out a deadly ambush in December 1993.

Another IRA bomb attack on 12 May 1992, against British troops on patrol near Cappagh, in which a paratrooper lost both legs, triggered a series of clashes on that date between soldiers and local residents in the staunchly republican town of Coalisland, on 12 and 17 May 1992. The 12 May riots ended with the paratroopers&#x27; assault on three bars, where they injured seven civilians. Another street fracas five days later, on 17 May, between a King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers platoon and a group of nationalist youths in Coalisland resulted in the theft of an army machine gun and a new confrontation with the paratroopers. Six paratroopers were charged with criminal damage in the aftermath, but were acquitted in 1993. Five were bound over.

At least two minor engagements occurred in the following weeks between members of the brigade and British Army foot patrols. On 22 June 1992, British troops exchange fire with snipers near Cookstown, while a British soldier from the Coldstream Guards was seriously wounded in Pomeroy when his patrol was fired on by an IRA unit on 2 August 1992. Another soldier in the same patrol had a narrow escape when a rifle round hit his gear. News reports claim that the IRA used an AK-74 rifle in the Pomeroy ambush. IRA volunteers from the Tyrone Brigade also carried out attacks with automatic weapons on the RUC barracks at Dungannon, on 21 June 1992 and on the British Army base at Omagh, on 7 December 1992.

The brigade was the first to use the Mark-15 Barrack-Buster mortar in an attack on 7 December 1992 against the RUC station in Ballygawley. The heavy mortar round, fired from a tractor near the town&#x27;s health center, was deflected by a tree besides the barracks wall. Several people was evacuated, and the bomb disposal squad struggled 10 hours to defuse the device. A later IRA statement acknowledges that the mortar bomb had &quot;failed to detonate properly&quot;.

On 19 January 1993 the brigade claimed that their volunteers uncovered and destroyed a British army observation post concealed in a derelict house in Drumcairne Forest, near Stewartstown. The same source reported that a British helicopter, a military ambulance and ground troops arrived to the scene shortly after, and that local residents believed that two soldiers had been wounded. Press reports at the time say that an abandoned house on Castlefarm Road was shattered by an explosion and subsequent fire, but that there were no security forces in the area when the device went off.

On 30 March 1993, one of the brigade units claimed they thwarted a British undercover operation by detonating an explosive device in the Glen, between Loughmacrory and Mountfield, near the spot where the British personnel were hidden. An RUC report confirms that a bomb exploded close to a combined RUC-British Army patrol in the area. According to them, a second device was defused in the follow-up operation.

From mid-1992 up to the 1994 cease fire, IRA units in east and south Tyrone carried out a dozen bomb and mortar attacks against RUC and military bases and assets. The facilities targeted by &quot;Barrack Buster&quot; mortars included the above-mentioned Ballygawley barracks, a British Army border outpost at Aughnacloy, the RUC barracks at Clogher and Beragh, both resulting in massive damage but no fatalities; two attacks on the RUC base in Caledon, which was also hit by gunfire in the second attack, and the RUC compounds at Dungannon, Fintona, Carrickmore, and Pomeroy.

A brigade statement claims that late on the evening of 26 April 1993, a &quot;variation&quot; of the Mark-15 was fired at a British Army position on an open field near the river Fury, a few miles east of Clogher. According to them, the explosion was heard from Augher to Fivemiletown, and there was a number of British casualties. A British Army report states that a device exploded beside an army patrol near County Bridge, a border crossing between Augher and Aughnacloy. On 30 April, a heavy horizontal mortar was fired at an RUC patrol vehicle near Ballygawley roundabout; the round missed its target and hit a wall.

The RUC security base at Caledon became the target of the &quot;Barrack Busters&quot; twice. On 11 May 1993, an IRA militant pretending to be a motorist that had been asked to show his licence at the barracks left a van carrying a mortar outside the facilities. The device landed unexploded inside the complex, resulting in its evacuation. The facilities came under attack once again on 7 November, when a supporting team armed with automatic weapons secured the area around the barracks, allowing an Isuzu Trooper carrying a &quot;Barrack Buster&quot; to be driven just outside the base. The support team sprayed the installations with a burst of gunfire, but the mortar overshot the compound, damaging an adjacent church. Fifty people were evacuated. Ulster Unionist Party councillor Jim Hamilton denounced that an IRA unit riding on a three-vehicle motorcade launched the attack after travelling three miles from beyond the Irish border.

On 6 June 1993, an IRA unit converted a stolen van in a &quot;mobile mortar launcher&quot; in the area of Pomeroy and slipped through British forces&#x27; surveillance to the RUC barracks at Carrickmore. According to the brigade report, the van, fitted with a Mark-15 mortar, was left besides a military sangar. The area was previously secured by a group of armed volunteers. The unit dispersed after setting on the mortar&#x27;s timer. The projectile landed within the grounds of the base, causing some damage according to the RUC. The IRA asserts instead that the barracks were &quot;extensively damaged&quot;. They also claimed that during the follow-up search, British Army technicians defused with a controlled explosion a mortar round, fired three years before.

An explosive device fired at the RUC barracks in Dungannon on 9 July 1993, that according to the IRA was a Mark-15 mortar bomb, prompted the evacuation of a nearby housing state.

Other operations against security facilities in this period included a sniper and small arms attack on the British Army base of Killymeal, Dungannon, on 22 May 1993; the brigade claimed a subsequent exchange of fire between IRA volunteers in supporting role and British soldiers crewing an observation post. RUC sources denied that the soldiers returned fire during the shooting. The fortified courthouse in Cookstown was meanwhile damaged by two bombs planted there on 15 October 1993, in an attack also directed to the adjoining British Army checkpoint. Dozens of residents were evacuated to a neighbouring church&#x27;s hall. A joint RUC/British Army patrol was caught in the second blast, but no injuries were reported.

A major ambush occurred on 12 December 1993 in Fivemiletown, when an RUC mobile patrol received intense cross fire from a brigade&#x27;s active unit on the town&#x27;s main street, and two constables were slain. A second IRA rifle team fired at a British Army Lynx helicopter sending in reinforcements to the area over the surroundings of Fivemiletown. All the IRA members involved withdrew successfully.

On 21 February 1994, the brigade launched a mortar attack from a travelling van on the RUC barracks at Beragh. The base suffered &quot;major structural damage&quot;, as well as most houses in the village.

On 9 April 1994, after a three-day IRA ceasefire, a Mark-15 mortar was launched at midday at the British Army permanent checkpoint in Aughnacloy. The heavy projectile landed at the rear of the small base without exploding, forcing the evacuation of Coronation Park housing state. According to other sources, the device actually exploded but caused little damage. The East Tyrone Brigade reported that they took over the area between the checkpoint and the border, set a roadblock, then drove a tractor carrying the mortar to the firing point and issued a 30-minute warning. On 27 May 1994, the British Army checkpoint at Aughnacloy was the target of an attack once again, when the compound came under automatic fire from an improvised tactical vehicle consisting of a Ford Transit van mounting a concealed heavy machine gun. British troops manning the outpost returned fire. The armed vehicle crossed the border after the engagement.

Sources from the brigade released a detailed statement on the attack on Pomeroy security base, carried out in the first hours of 26 June 1994, claiming that they had fired a single Mark-15 barrack-buster bomb. The unit, moving on two vehicles from the townland of Turnabarson, managed to snake into a heavy patrolled area to the firing point on Station Road and launched the shell by timer from a range of . The British Army claimed that the mortar round exploded in a bog just outside the perimeter fence, while the IRA unit said that the bomb landed in the grounds of the barracks. No injuries were reported.

On 15 July 1994, an armed dump truck ambushed an RUC armoured mobile patrol at Killeshil, near Dungannon. Incidentally, the RUC vehicle was carrying in custody Pat Treanor, a Sinn Féin councillor from Clones, a border town in County Monaghan, Republic of Ireland. The RUC patrol returned fire. Three constables and Treanor were wounded, as well as a passing-by elderly female motorist whose car was hit by the RUC vehicle. The IRA unit managed to get away unscathed.

====== Botched operations ======
There were also a number of roadside bomb and mortar attacks thwarted by the security forces in east and south Tyrone in this period. A primed Mk-12 horizontal mortar was defused near Clogher on 9 April 1992 by British Army technicians, while a trailer carrying a &#x27;barrack buster&#x27; was recovered by security forces and also defused in the same area on 16 January 1994. The IRA acknowledged that the attack &quot;had to be abandoned due to heavy presence of crown forces in the area&quot;. On 30 July 1993, a device was uncovered by security forces in Pomeroy, and one man was arrested. The RUC claim that the machine gun stolen in Coalisland and other arms were recovered from a farmhouse near Cappagh on 29 May 1992. An IRA volunteer was arrested, while two other members of the IRA made good their escape. Nationalist politician Bernardette Devlin McAliskey suggested that the recovery of the machine gun was actually staged by the security forces as a publicity stunt. On 11 May 1993, British security forces found and defused a horizontal mortar complete with warhead in Dungannon. An IRA man was taken in custody in Newtownstewart, west Tyrone, on 10 July 1993, after being injured during a mishap while testing an improvised mortar in a barn near Dungannon whose firing pack exploded prematurely.

====== British casualties ======
Three active members of the security forces were killed by the East Tyrone Brigade during this period. Among them there were Constable Andrew Beacom and Reserve Constable Ernest Smith, the two RUC members ambushed and shot dead while driving a civilian type vehicle in Fivemiletown&#x27;s main street on 12 December 1993. Another fatality was a Royal Irish Regiment (RIR) soldier, Private Christopher Wren, slain when off-duty by the blast of a booby-trap planted in his car. The device exploded while he was driving on Carrydarragh road, near Moneymore, County Londonderry, on 31 May 1993, just a few miles from Cookstown. A second soldier, Sergeant Dean Oliver, died in a fratricide incident in Fivemiletown on 9 May 1992, in the aftermath of an IRA bomb attack in the area, as mentioned above.

At least two British soldiers were severely wounded in action near Cappagh and Pomeroy in 1992.

====Other attacks====
On 17 January 1992, an IRA roadside bomb destroyed a van carrying 14 workers who had been re-building Lisanelly British Army base in Omagh. Eight were killed and the rest were badly wounded. The bombing was at Teebane Crossroads, near Cookstown. One of the workers killed, Robert Dunseath, was an off-duty Royal Irish Rangers soldier. Two of the wounded were also off-duty UDR soldiers. The IRA said that the workers were legitimate targets because they were &quot;collaborating&quot; with the &quot;forces of occupation&quot;. As the men were all Protestants, many Protestants saw it as a sectarian attack. The UDA retaliated by shooting dead five Catholic male civilians inside a betting shop on the Ormeau Road, Belfast.

IRA volunteers in Tyrone were the target of an assassination campaign carried out by the loyalist paramilitaries of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). The UVF killed 40 people in East Tyrone between 1988 and 1994. Of these, most were Catholics civilians with no known paramilitary connections but six were Provisional Irish Republican Army members. When the IRA responded by killing a retired UDR member, Leslie Dallas, and two elderly Protestants, Austin Nelson and Ernest Rankin at Coagh, on 7 March 1989, the UVF shot dead three IRA members and a Catholic civilian in a pub in Cappagh on 3 March 1991. The main target, Brian Arthurs, escaped injury. The IRA alleged that Dallas was a senior UVF member but this was denied by his family, the police, and the UVF. Both &quot;Lost Lives&quot; and the Sutton Index of Deaths (at CAIN) list him as a civilian. The IRA retaliated on 5 August 1991 by shooting and killing a former UDR soldier leaving his workplace along Altmore Road, Cappagh. On 11 January 1993 a former sergeant of the B-Specials (Matthew Boyd) was shot dead while driving his car along Donaghmore Road, Dungannon, County Tyrone. The IRA claimed the man was a UVF commander, responsible for the killings of Catholic civilians. This was denied by the dead man&#x27;s family. CAIN lists Boyd as a Protestant civilian. A former UDR soldier (David Martin) was killed when an IRA bomb exploded underneath his car in Kildress, County Tyrone on 25 April 1993; it was claimed that he had loyalist connections. The latter attack led to loyalist allegations that the IRA was killing Protestant land-owners in Tyrone and Fermanagh in an orchestrated campaign to drive Protestants out of the region, to the point that they drew an analogy with contemporaneous ethnic cleansing in the Balkans. This is disputed by some authors as an &quot;exaggeration&quot;.

A gun attack on the home of DUP politician Willie McCrea on 10 July 1994 at Magherafelt, County Londonderry, was attributed to members of the East Tyrone Brigade. Sources claim that the IRA leadership stood down the unit responsible.

===List of actions from 1996 until the 1997 IRA ceasefire===

There were a number of actions carried out by the IRA in the eastern part of Tyrone from 1996 up to the latest IRA ceasefire of July 1997:
*2 February 1996: the house of a part-time member of the RUC was riddled with 57 gunshots in Moy. There were no casualties. A &#x27;senior security source&#x27; claimed that the IRA was responsible, although the IRA later denied as &quot;mischievous&quot; any claims that it was involved in the incident.
*5 February 1997: an IRA unit fired a horizontal mortar at an RUC patrol on Newell Road in Dungannon. There were no injuries.
*10 February 1997: a horizontal mortar fired by an IRA unit hit an RUC armoured vehicle leaving a security base. The ambush took place outside the village of Pomeroy. One RUC officer was injured.
*22 February 1997: an IRA mortar unit was intercepted by the RUC in Caledon, on its way to carry out an attack on a British security facility. A five-mile (8 km) chase followed before the IRA volunteers managed to escape on foot.
*26 March 1997: a grenade was thrown by IRA volunteers at the British Army/RUC base in Coalisland. The device holed the perimeter fence. Undercover members of the British Army shot and seriously injured 19-year-old republican Gareth Doris in the aftermath. The soldiers left the scene under the protection of the RUC after being cornered by a crowd. Two women were wounded by plastic bullets fired by RUC officers. Doris recovered from his wounds and was sentenced to ten years in jail for involvement in the attack before being released in 2000 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
*5 July 1997: In Coalisland, a female RUC officer from Portadown was shot in the face by an IRA volunteer during an attack on an armoured vehicle beside the British Army/RUC base. Her wounds were said to be non life-threatening.
*8 July 1997: A landmine was planted by the IRA near Dungannon, leading to a bomb alert. There were no casualties.
*9 July 1997: IRA gunmen hijacked and burned a number of vehicles at Dungannon.

Róisín McAliskey, daughter of political activist Bernadette McAliskey and suspected IRA member from Coalisland was accused by German authorities of being involved in a mortar attack on British Army facilities in Osnabrück, Germany, on 28 June 1996. Her extradition from Northern Ireland was eventually denied in 2007 due to discrepancies in the claims against her.

The commander of the brigade, Kevin McKenna, was appointed Chief of Staff of the IRA in 1983. He would be the longest-serving volunteer in this position, right up to the 1997 ceasefire.

<text>The Scarecrow is a character in the fictional Land of Oz created by American author L. Frank Baum and illustrator W.W. Denslow. In his first appearance, the Scarecrow reveals that he lacks a brain and desires above all else to have one. In reality, he is only two days old and merely naïve. Throughout the course of the novel, he proves to have the brains he seeks and is later recognized as &quot;the wisest man in all of Oz,&quot; although he continues to credit the Wizard for them. He is, however, wise enough to know his own limitations and all too happy to hand the rulership of Oz to Princess Ozma and become one of her trusted advisors, though he typically spends more time having fun than advising.

==Character biography==
===In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;===
In Baum&#x27;s classic 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the living scarecrow encounters Dorothy Gale in a field in the Munchkin Country while she is on her way to the Emerald City. He tells her about his creation and of how he at first scared away the crows, before an older one realized he was a straw man, causing the other crows to start eating the corn. The old crow then told the Scarecrow about the importance of brains. The &quot;mindless&quot; Scarecrow joins Dorothy in the hope that The Wizard will give him a brain. They are later joined by the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion. When the group goes to the West, he kills the Witch&#x27;s crows by breaking their necks. He is torn apart by the Flying Monkeys and his clothes thrown up a tree, but when his clothes are filled with straw he is back again. After Dorothy and her friends have completed their mission to kill the Wicked Witch of the West, the Wizard gives the Scarecrow brains (made out of bran, pins and needles – in reality, a placebo, as he has been the most intelligent of the group all along). Before he leaves Oz in a balloon, the Wizard appoints the Scarecrow to rule the Emerald City in his absence. He accompanies Dorothy and the others to the palace of the Good Witch of the South Glinda, and she uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged Monkeys, who take the Scarecrow back to the Emerald City.

His desire for a brain notably contrasts with the Tin Woodman&#x27;s desire for a heart, reflecting a common debate between the relative importance of the mind and emotions. Indeed, both believe they have neither. This philosophical debate between the two friends as to why their own choices are superior; neither convinces the other and Dorothy, listening, is unable to decide which one is right. Symbolically, because they remain with Dorothy throughout her quest, she is provided with both and need not select.

===Later Oz books===

The Scarecrow also appears in other Oz books, sharing further adventures with Dorothy and her friends. His reign as king of the Emerald City ends in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; when General Jinjur and her Army of Revolt oust him in a coup. He manages to escape the palace and joins Tip and his companions in seeking the aid of Glinda the Good. He spars with H. M. Woggle-Bug T. E. on the value of education. Although he claims to be educated himself and to value education, he finds the Woggle-Bug&#x27;s learning rote and without wisdom. Although he cannot eat, he tells Billina that she might be better cooked and generally seems to favor the use of animals as food, sometimes making snide remarks to that effect to his animal companions, although he himself only gathers nuts and fruit for his traveling companions, such as Dorothy and Tip, to eat.

By &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; he is acknowledged, at least by the Tin Woodman, to be &quot;probably the wisest man in all Oz,&quot; and this is the caption of an illustration, suggesting that the reader take his comment at face value. Dorothy herself, in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot;, praises the Scarecrow&#x27;s wisdom and says the Scarecrow seemed just as wise before the Wizard gave him brains as after. In &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, the Scarecrow lives in a house-shaped like an ear of corn in Winkie Country. In &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot;, the Scarecrow travels to Jinxland, where he helps Cap&#x27;n Bill, Trot and Button-Bright overthrow the villainous King Krewl. In &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot; the Scarecrow serves as Regent to Ozma of Oz, demonstrating that he is Ozma&#x27;s third in command. Mostly all he does is play croquet until Ozma&#x27;s advisers, including himself, band together for a rescue operation.

In &quot;The Royal Book of Oz&quot; by Ruth Plumly Thompson, Baum&#x27;s authorized successor as &quot;Royal Historian of Oz&quot;, Professor Woggle-Bug accused the Scarecrow of having no ancestry, so he returns to the pole at the cornfield where he was once hung. Sliding down it and descending underground, he first encounters the Middlings and then the Silver Islands, whose people believe themselves to be the ancestors of the Chinese. Apparently, when Emperor Chang Wang Woe defeated the king of the Golden Islands in battle, the king hired a sorcerer to sneak into the palace and transform the Emperor into a crocus, which later sprouted into a bean pole, preceding a prophecy that the first being to touch the bean pole would become possessed by the spirit of the Emperor. As it turned out, the first thing to touch the pole was the straw-stuffed human, which would become the Scarecrow. This account is not consistent with the Scarecrow&#x27;s story in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; of becoming aware of each sense as the relevant organs were painted on his head.

==Scholarly interpretations==

Economics and history professors have published scholarly studies that indicate the images and characters used by Baum and Denslow closely resembled political images that were well known in the 1890s. The Scarecrow, like other characters and elements in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, was a common theme found in editorial cartoons of the previous decade. Baum and Denslow, like most writers, used the materials at hand that they knew best. They built a story around them, added Dorothy, and added a series of lessons to the effect that everyone possesses the resources they need (such as brains, a heart, and courage) if only they had self-confidence. Although it was a children&#x27;s book, of course, Baum noted in the preface that it was a &quot;modernized&quot; fairy tale as well.

Those who interpret &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; as a political allegory often see the Scarecrow, a central figure, as a reflection of the popular image of the American farmer— although he has been persuaded that he is only a stupid hick, he possesses common sense, logic and a quick wit that needs only to be reinforced by self-confidence.

The blackface minstrel star Fred Stone was the first to play the Scarecrow on stage, and he brought his minstrel style of performance to the role of the Scarecrow. Baum was delighted with Stone&#x27;s performance, and he wrote subsequent Oz books with Stone&#x27;s minstrel-style in mind.

==In popular culture==
===Television===
* In the 1961 animated TV series &quot;Tales of the Wizard of Oz&quot;, and its sequel, the 1964 NBC animated television special &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, the Scarecrow (here named Socrates) was voiced by Alfie Scopp.

* In a 1981 episode of &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot;, Shaggy is dressed as the Scarecrow after a tornado took him, Scooby, and Scrappy to &quot;Ahz&quot;, a direct spoof of Oz with a different spelling by its enunciation.
* Jackson Browne performed this character in the 1995 television special &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True&quot;. The Kansas farmworker Hunk does not appear in this production. Browne sang a folk music tempo of &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot; and the bridge verses sung by the Scarecrow in Nathan Lane&#x27;s longer version of &quot;If I Only Had the Nerve&quot;.
* In the 1996 &quot;The Oz Kids&quot;, animated cartoon, the Scarecrow now rules the Emerald City and has a son named Scarecrow Jr. His son is smart and knows everything just like him. Scarecrow Sr. is voiced by Andy Milder.
* The 2003 &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; cartoon&#x27;s fourth season has the episode Berry Brick Road, where the titular protagonist gets whisked to the land of Oz. The Scarecrow returns as her first companion, now being played by Ginger Snap and sharing his voice actor with the latter. (Strawberry Shortcake herself plays Dorothy Gale.) The Scarecrow&#x27;s appearance has been changed to look like Ginger Snap, sporting long pigtails that reach his waist and a jacket just like the one she wears for her default outfit.
* In the 2005 ABC television movie &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;, Kermit the Frog plays the role of the Scarecrow. Kermit&#x27;s other role was himself. Before Dorothy&#x27;s journey, he organizes a talent scout for a star for a new show. After Dorothy&#x27;s return, he hires her.
* In the 2007 Sci Fi television miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot;, the Scarecrow is re-imagined as the character named &quot;Glitch&quot; (played by Alan Cumming). Formerly a chief adviser to the queen of the Outer Zone (O.Z.) named Ambrose, he resists her usurper (and daughter), the evil sorceress Azkadellia and has his brain removed by the physician as a reeducation measure. In the series, he wanders the O.Z. searching for his brain and becomes a companion of the protagonist, a girl named DG.
* In the 2007 VeggieTales episode &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Ha&#x27;s&quot;, the Scarecrow and his Kansas counterpart from the 1939 film were played by Mr. Lunt the Gourd.
* A commercial for GE smart-grid technology, which first aired during the Super Bowl XLIII, featured a computerized Scarecrow dancing clumsily on a radio tower singing &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot;.
* In the 2017 live-action series &quot;Emerald City&quot;, a more modern retelling, the Scarecrow equivalent in the series is &quot;Lucas&quot; (portrayed by Oliver Jackson-Cohen) and is an amnesic man who is rescued by Dorothy when she finds him being crucified at the start of her journey. In the course of the story, it is revealed that he is actually Rowan, the husband of Glinda, with his amnesia the result of a spell Glinda casts so that he couldn&#x27;t betray her secrets if he was captured, but the restoration of his memory puts him and Dorothy at odds, as his devotion to Glinda leaves him incapable of recognizing Dorothy&#x27;s real objections to Glinda&#x27;s extreme methods to train younger witches. Psychologically torn between his memories as Rowan and his new relationships as Lucas, he eventually forces Dorothy to stab him to stop himself strangling her, culminating in Dorothy leaving him strung up like a scarecrow to symbolically reflect his desire to have never met her. Despite this, he appears in Kansas in the season finale, accompanied by Toto, to ask Dorothy to return with him to Oz.
* The Scarecrow appeared in the &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; episode &quot;Our Decay&quot;, voiced by Paul Scheer. Many years ago, Zelena the Wicked Witch of the West targeted him for his brain as part of her attempt to create a time-travel spell. Before she can remove Scarecrow&#x27;s brain, Dorothy and Toto arrived where they managed to get away from Zelena. With help from Hades who enchanted a bicycle that was found at the remains of Dorothy&#x27;s house, Zelena was able to locate where Dorothy and Scarecrow are hiding. After magically freezing Dorothy, Zelena successfully removed Scarecrow&#x27;s brain and was about to show it to Hades only to find that he is not there.
* Scarecrow appears in the 2017 animated television series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, voiced by Bill Fagerbakke.
* Scarecrow appears in &quot;Lost In Oz&quot;, voiced by Stephen Stanton.
* Although not a direct adaptation to the literature itself, the 2013 Super Sentai series, &quot;Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger&quot; features the Deboth Army&#x27;s members being themed after the characters in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. The then-Funfilled Spy Luckyulo is designed with the motif of the Scarecrow, who also shares his airheadedness and naivety to his source of inspiration.

===Films===
* The Scarecrow has appeared in nearly every early Oz film, portrayed by different actors each time, including Frank Burns in &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot; (1908); Robert Z. Leonard in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1910); Herbert Glennon in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1914); Frank Moore in &quot;His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz&quot; (1914); and Donald Henderson in &quot;The Land of Oz&quot; (1932).
* In the 1925 film &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man were actually human farmhands, who were blown to Oz by the tornado along with Dorothy. Dorothy, in another major departure from the novel, turns out to be the rightful ruler of Oz, having been exiled to Kansas as a baby.
* In the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Scarecrow was played by Ray Bolger in what is arguably the actor&#x27;s most famous role. He was originally cast as the Tin Woodsman, but Bolger had always wanted to play the Scarecrow, he was so upset about it since he wanted to switch roles with Buddy Ebsen, who was originally going to play the Scarecrow. Ebsen didn&#x27;t mind the swap, so Bolger and Ebsen swapped roles. While Ray was pleased with his role as the Scarecrow, the aluminum dust from Ebsen&#x27;s Tin Man make-up nearly choked him to death (causing Ebsen to have to give up that role). Ebsen was replaced by Jack Haley for his role of the Tin Man. Bolger&#x27;s costume consisted of a straw-stuffed suit and a light face mask of rubber designed to simulate burlap. The mask was fragile and usually had to be completely replaced at the start of each new day of filming. Bolger&#x27;s Scarecrow costume, minus the mask, is part of the collections of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution. Bolger was a talented dancer, so The Scarecrow was given an extended dance sequence in the movie. However, to shorten the movie, much of this sequence was edited out since it would slow down the pace of the film. While Bolger admitted in a 1939 radio broadcast that he was too young to have seen Fred Stone play the Scarecrow in the 1902 musical extravaganza, he told Stone on the broadcast that the first play he was allowed to see was &quot;The Red Mill&quot; featuring Stone, and that his performance in that play was an inspiration. During the scene where the Scarecrow gets his &quot;brain&quot; (an honorary Ph.D. diploma) from the Wizard, he incorrectly recites the Pythagorean theorem, emphasizing that the real gift bestowed upon the characters was confidence in qualities they already possess. Bolger also portrayed the Scarecrow&#x27;s Kansas counterpart, Hunk (one of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry&#x27;s farmworkers), newly created for the film by screenwriter Noel Langley. A scene which was written in the script, but dropped before filming commenced, ended the movie by sending Hunk off to agricultural college, with Dorothy promising to write. The scene implied the potential for a romance between the two characters. He helps Zeke (Cowardly Lion&#x27;s alter ego) and Hickory (Tin Man&#x27;s alter ego) repair a wagon. Unlike Zeke, Hickory and Hunk lose their hats with Uncle Henry as they struggle to open the cellar when the tornado approaches their farm. He closes and locks the cellar with Zeke when Dorothy arrives at the farmhouse. Hunk reunites with Dorothy when she awakens from being unconscious. He is seen with Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, Zeke, Hickory, and Professor Marvel (The Wizard&#x27;s alter ego).
* In the animated film &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; (produced in 1964 but not released until the 1970s), the Scarecrow was voiced by Mickey Rooney.
* Justin Case, an English bicycle acrobat, appeared briefly as the Scarecrow in the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. He was turned into an ornament by Nome King. Scarecrow was restored when Dorothy quoted Oz upon touching a green ornament. When Princess Ozma was freed from her mirror prison, Scarecrow allows her to regain the throne.
* In the 2013 film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;, the Scarecrow&#x27;s origins are explained; being fabricated by the townspeople of Oz as a diversionary tactic during the retaliatory attack on the Emerald City.
* American voice actor Michael Gough voices the Scarecrow in 2011&#x27;s direct-to-DVD animated film &quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot;.
* The Scarecrow appears in the 2012 film &quot;Dorothy and the Witches of Oz&quot; played by Ari Zigaris. He appears on Earth in the form of a man named Allen Denslow who works as the illustrator of Dorothy Gale&#x27;s books.
* The Scarecrow appeared in the animated film &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot; (which is based on &quot;Dorothy of Oz&quot;), voiced by Dan Aykroyd.
* Scarecrow appears in &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot;. Alongside Dorothy and the rest of her friends, Scarecrow is somehow transported from the Land of Oz to Harmony Town in the Systar System.

===Video games===
* The Scarecrow (along with his other friends from OZ) are playable in the Nintendo 3DS game &quot;Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.&quot;
* Scarecrow appears in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, voiced by William Salyers. During the part of the game that takes place in the Land of Oz, Batman mistook Scarecrow for his Scarecrow.
*The Scarecrow appears as an enemy in &quot;&quot; along with the Tin Man and the Lion in the Forbidden Library.
* The Scarecrow appears as one of the narrators for the detective quest in Sherlock: Hidden Match-3 Cases, developed by G5 Entertainment in 2020.

* Hinton Battle originated the role of the Scarecrow in the 1975 Broadway musical &quot;The Wiz&quot;, and Michael Jackson played the Scarecrow in 1978 film adaptation. This version of the Scarecrow was a more tragic character before Dorothy rescues him; while hung on his pole, the crows he is unable to scare, who force him to humiliate himself and entertain them, torment him day and night with their negative and nihilistic worldview, convincing him there&#x27;s no point in trying to be more than what he is. They force him to sing the song, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot;, meaning that he cannot escape the crows&#x27; rule and his bad luck. While Stan Winston created Jackson&#x27;s makeup, it was applied to Jackson&#x27;s face by Michael R. Thomas who portrayed the Scarecrow in Barry Mahon&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Land of Oz&quot; (1969), as well as doing the makeup for that film. Elijah Kelley portrayed the Scarecrow in the TV special &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot;, as well as the farmhand Sticks.
* In 2003 musical of Gregory Maguire&#x27;s interpretation of the Oz franchise titled &quot;Wicked&quot;, this version of the Scarecrow was Fiyero Tigelaar, the love interest of Elphaba Thropp. Fiyero attends school with Elphaba and Galinda, while they were all still young. Fiyero takes a special interest in Elphaba. However, he is highly sought after by Elphaba&#x27;s roommate, Glinda. Fiyero and Elphaba share a secret romance, and when she leaves for the Emerald City, he gives her a long and meaningful goodbye. Many years later, after Elphaba goes into hiding, we are shown that Glinda and Fiyero are to be wed. However, this is not because of love, at least not on Fiyero&#x27;s part, for he still loves Elphaba. Once she reappears in the Emerald City, they escape together, much to Glinda&#x27;s discontent. Elphaba then goes to the site of her sister&#x27;s death (Dorothy&#x27;s arrival into Oz). Here she is ambushed by guards, and about to be taken away when Fiyero saves her, but he is merely sacrificing himself to save her. Elphaba in a fit of rage and heartbreak reads a spell to keep Fiyero safe, with the words of the spell including pleas to let him feel no pain and never die however they try to destroy him. Although Elphaba abandons the spell as she believes it is not working, it is not until the end of the production that we are shown that Fiyero is still alive, and has been transformed into the Scarecrow from &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.
* The Scarecrow is made a more prominent character in its Broadway musical adaptation &quot;Wicked&quot;. In the musical, the Scarecrow is revealed to be the remnants of Fiyero after he was captured by the Wizard&#x27;s officials but made impervious to injury by Elphaba&#x27;s incomplete spell. The Fiyero-Scarecrow executes a plan to save Elphaba by using the rumor that water will melt her; thus she stays alive and the two move out of Oz. This has no basis in the book other than that in the final scenes Elphaba hopes that the Scarecrow is really her beloved Fiyero in disguise, which is proven to be a false hope when he is attacked and she sees that he is nothing but straw. In the musical, the Fiyero-Scarecrow&#x27;s appearance and style of walking are based on Bolger&#x27;s portrayal of the Scarecrow in the 1939 film.

===Comic books and novels===
* A character inspired by the Scarecrow appears in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Lost Girls&quot;. In the work, a young farm boy becomes Dorothy Gale&#x27;s first sex partner. However, she soon grows bored of him because of his lack of intelligence and imagination, comparing it to having sex with something you use to scare the crows. The &quot;scarecrow&quot; tries to prove to Dorothy that he does have a brain and writes her a poem.
* The Scarecrow is a minor character in author Gregory Maguire&#x27;s revisionist novel &quot;&quot;.
* The Scarecrow is featured more prominently in &quot;Son of a Witch&quot;, Maguire&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Wicked&quot;. In that novel, the Scarecrow helps the Witch&#x27;s son Liir avoid political turmoil in the Emerald City after the Wizard&#x27;s departure. Later, various powerful interests place a different Scarecrow on the throne of Oz to serve as a puppet ruler; the suggestion is that most residents of Oz are unable to distinguish one Scarecrow from another.
* In the 2014 &quot;Dorothy Must Die&quot; series by Danielle Paige that details a darker depiction of the Land of Oz, the Scarecrow and Dorothy&#x27;s other companions have been corrupted by their gifts and Dorothy&#x27;s use of magic. The Scarecrow has become a twisted &#x27;mad scientist&#x27;, performing various experiments on the animals to turn them into spies or warriors for Dorothy&#x27;s army, as well as extracting their brains to increase his own. He is &#x27;killed&#x27; in the second novel in the series &quot;The Wicked Will Rise&quot; when the Wizard takes his brains as part of a plan to bring Oz and Kansas together.
* In the pages of &quot;Shazam!&quot;, Scarecrow is a resident of the location of the Magic land called Wozenderlands. He and the Munchkins find some of the Shazam Family in their part of Wozenderlands. When Billy Batson, Mary Bromfield, and C.C. Batson are teleported to Wozenderlands, they are taken by Scarecrow and the Munchkins to meet with Dorothy Gale. Scarecrow stated that Dorothy Gale and Alice united the Land of Oz and Wonderland to save them from the threats that came from the Monsterlands. They are attacked by Cheshire Cat near the Blue Brick Road that goes through the Queen of Hearts&#x27; forest causing Billy and Mary to drive him off. When Mamaragan appeared and also teleported the rest of the foster siblings to Wozenderlands, White Rabbit then gives Scarecrow the ax that belonged to the Tin Man while apologizing for what the Queen of Hearts and her Card Soldiers did to him. When Mister Mind has Shazam cast a spell to unite the seven Magiclands, Scarecrow and White Rabbit start to see the effects of it.

<text>The majority of funerals (, &quot;sōgi&quot; or , &quot;sōshiki&quot;) in Japan include a wake, the cremation of the deceased, a burial in a family grave, and a periodic memorial service. According to 2007 statistics, 99.81% of deceased Japanese are cremated.

Other practices in Japan include Shinto funerals and the Ryukyuan people’s indigenous sepultural culture.

==Modern funerals==

===After death===
Although Japan has become a more secular society (see Religion in Japan), , 90% of funerals are conducted as Buddhist ceremonies. Immediately after a death (or, in earlier days, just before the expected death), relatives moisten the dying or deceased person&#x27;s lips with water, a practice known as . Most Japanese homes maintain Buddhist altars, or , for use in Buddhist ceremonies; and many also have Shinto shrines, or . When a death occurs, the shrine is closed and covered with white paper to keep out the impure spirits of the dead, a custom called . A small table decorated with flowers, incense, and a candle is placed next to the deceased&#x27;s bed.

The relatives and authorities are informed, and a death certificate is issued. Funeral arrangements typically are made by the eldest son and are begun by contacting a temple to schedule the event. Some days are more auspicious than others, based on an old Chinese six-day lunar cycle; in particular, the second day, called , is superstitiously understood to mean &quot;pulling your friends along with you&quot; (&quot;tomo&quot; = friends; &quot;hiku&quot; = pull, although the original significance was different) and is therefore considered a terrible day for a funeral but a good day for a wedding.

The body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. An &quot;encoffining&quot; ritual (called a &quot;nōkan&quot;) is sometimes performed, in which professional ritually dress and prepare the body and place it in the coffin (this is portrayed in the 2008 film &quot;Departures&quot;). The ceremony is now rarely performed, and may be limited to rural areas where older traditions are maintained. Whether or not the encoffining ceremony is performed, a deceased female is dressed in a white kimono, and a deceased male is dressed in a suit or a kimono. Makeup may be applied. The body is put on dry ice in a casket. Items—such as a white kimono, a pair of sandals, six coins for crossing the River of Three Crossings, and burnable items of which the deceased was fond of (for example, cigarettes and candy) are placed in the casket, which is then put on an altar for the wake. The body is placed with its head toward the north or, as a second choice, toward the west. In Buddhism, the western orientation reflects the western realm of Amida Buddha.

During life, both men and women cross the front of a kimono or yukata with the left side over the right. On those occasions in which the corpse is clothed in a traditional kimono, the kimono is crossed right over left.

===Wake===


Held as soon as possible after death, a Japanese wake is called , lit. &quot;passing the night&quot;. All funeral guests wear black: men wear black suits with white shirts and black ties, and women wear either black dresses or black kimono. If the deceased was an adherent to Buddhism, a set of prayer beads called may be carried by the guests. People attending the wake or funeral offer condolence money to the host/hostess, in special black-and-silver envelopes ( or ). Depending on the relationship to the deceased and the wealth of the guest, the amount may be equivalent to between 3,000 and 30,000 yen. The guests are seated, with immediate relatives seated closest to the front. The Buddhist priest then chants a section from a sutra. The family members will each offer incense three times to the incense urn in front of the deceased. At the same time, the assembled guests will perform the same ritual at another location behind the family members&#x27; seats. The wake ends once the priest has completed the sutra. Each departing guest is given a gift, which has a value of about half or one quarter of the condolence money received from this guest. The closest relatives may stay and keep vigil with the deceased overnight in the same room.

===Funeral===

The funeral proper, called , is usually on the day after the wake. The procedure is similar to the wake, and incense is offered while a priest chants a sutra. The ceremony differs slightly as the deceased receives a new Buddhist name (戒名, &quot;kaimyō&quot;; lit. &quot;precept name&quot;) written in Kanji. This name is said to prevent the return of the deceased if their name is called. The length of the name depends also on either the virtue of the person&#x27;s lifespan or more commonly, the size of the donation of the relatives to the temple, which may range from a generally common name to the most elaborate names for 1 million yen or more. The high prices charged by the temples are a controversial issue in Japan, especially since some temples put pressure on families to buy a more expensive name. The kanji for these &quot;kaimyō&quot; are usually very ancient, and sometimes with esoteric meanings.

At the end of the funeral ceremony, the guests and family may place flowers in the casket around the deceased&#x27;s head and shoulders before the casket is sealed and carried to the elaborately decorated hearse and transported to the crematorium. In some regions of Japan, the coffin is nailed shut by the mourners using a stone.

===Cremation===

The coffin is placed on a tray in the crematorium. The family witnesses the sliding of the body into the cremation chamber. A cremation usually takes about two hours, and the family returns at a scheduled time when the cremation has been completed.

The relatives pick the bones out of the ashes and transfer them to the urn using large chopsticks or metal chopsticks, two relatives holding the same bone at the same time with their chopsticks. In other customs, they pass the bones from chopsticks to chopsticks. Known as , this is the only time in Japan when it is proper for two people to hold the same item at the same time with chopsticks. At all other times, holding anything with chopsticks by two people at the same time, or passing an item from chopsticks to chopsticks, is considered to be a major social &quot;faux pas&quot; as this will remind bystanders about a funeral. The bones of the feet are picked up first, and the bones of the head are picked up last. This is to ensure that the deceased is not upside down in the urn. The , which is a bone located in the neck: the second cervical vertebra (&quot;axis&quot;), is the most significant bone to be placed in the urn. The word &quot;nodobotoke&quot; in a living person, however, refers to the visible Adam&#x27;s apple, which is a different organ.

In some cases, the ashes may be divided among more than one urn. For example, some ashes go to a family grave, and some go to the temple or even to a company grave or to a space burial. Depending upon the local custom, the urn may stay at the family home for a period or may be directly taken to the graveyard.

In the Ryukyu Islands, the traditional burial was somewhat different from that in the mainland Japan. Instead of cremation, the body would be temporarily interred in the family tomb (a large burial vault, often of the turtle-back variety); after a few years, once the flesh had decomposed, the bones would be washed and put into the funerary urn, to be permanently stored elsewhere in the tomb.

===Grave===
A typical Japanese grave is usually a consisting of a stone monument, with a place for flowers, incense, and water in front of the monument and a chamber or crypt underneath for the ashes.
The date of the erection of the grave and the name of the person who purchased it may be engraved on the side of the monument. The names of the deceased are often but not always engraved on the front of the monument. When a married person dies before his or her spouse, the name of the spouse may also be engraved on the stone, with the letters painted red. After the death and the burial of the spouse, the red ink is removed from the stone. This is usually done for financial reasons, as it is cheaper to engrave two names at the same time than to engrave the second name when the second spouse dies. It can also be seen as a sign that they are waiting to follow their spouse into the grave. However, this practice is less frequent nowadays. The names of the deceased may also be engraved on the left side, or on a separate stone in front of the grave. Often, the name is also written on a sotōba, a separate wooden board on a stand behind or next to the grave. These sotōba may be erected shortly after death, and new ones may be added at certain memorial services.

Some graves may also have a box for business cards, where friends and relatives visiting the grave can drop their business card, informing the caretakers of the grave of the respects the visitors have paid to the deceased.

The high prices of funeral plots, costing on average 2 million yen, have led to a new service of , where a locker-sized grave can be purchased for about 400,000 yen. Some of these may even include a touch screen showing a picture of the deceased, messages, a family tree, and other information. Due to the cost of land, a graveyard in Tokyo has recently been opened by a temple in floors 3 to 8 of a nine-story building, where the lower floors are for funeral ceremonies.

There are a number of cases where the ashes of deceased persons have been stolen from graves. The ashes of famous cartoonist Machiko Hasegawa and of the wife of real estate chairman Takichi Hayasaka were stolen for ransom. The ashes of famous novelist Yukio Mishima (1925–1970) were stolen in 1971 and the ashes of novelist Naoya Shiga were stolen in 1980. The ashes of the wife of the baseball player Sadaharu Oh went missing in December 2002.

===Mourning and memorial services===

Memorial services depend on local customs. Usually, there are a number of memorial services following the death - for example, daily for the first seven days, or a number of services within the first 49 days, or on the 7th, 49th and 100th day, depending on the local custom. Most commonly observed are the Buddhist service on the seventh day after death, , and the 49th day, . In many traditions, the urn containing the ashes is interred in a ceremony called on the 49th day, and the family stays in mourning until this.

After that, there is a memorial service on the Obon festival in honor of the dead. The festival may be held in the 1st year, sometimes in the 3rd and 5th, 7th and 13th years, and a number of times afterwards up to either the 39th or the 50th year. One popular sequence follows the days of the Thirteen Buddhas.

A picture of the deceased is also placed at or near the family altar in the household. Also, in the first year after death, no traditional New Year&#x27;s Day Postcard is sent or received. The friends and relatives have to be informed of this beforehand so as not to send a card.

==Japanese funeral industry==
The average cost of a Japanese funeral is about 2.31 million yen (US$25,000) according to a 2008 study by the Japan Consumers Association. This cost includes services such as 401,000 yen for catering to attendants and 549,000 yen for services of the priest. Overall, the industry has a revenue of about 1.5 trillion yen with about 45,000 funeral homes. In 2004, 1.1 million Japanese died (2003: 1.0 million), a number that is expected to rise in the future due to the increase of the average age in Japan; see demographics of Japan. Funeral Business Monthly estimates that there will be 1.7 million deaths by 2035, and revenue of 2 trillion yen in 2040.

Recently there have been some changes in the funeral industry, and some funeral homes offer more competitive and transparent pricing than a standard funeral provider. These offer funerals starting at about 200,000 yen, a fraction of the regular overpriced services, and lists the different options and prices to choose from &quot;a la carte&quot;. Many of these new funeral homes are started by non-Japanese nationals. Also, recently hotels with a decreasing income due to a decrease in weddings have started to offer funeral services. Overall, the level of competition is increasing. To stay competitive, the prices of regular funeral homes are also decreasing over time. Another recent introduction are services where a person can choose his or her funeral service before death and pays a monthly fee (e.g. 10,000 yen) to cover all costs of the funeral.

==History==

Throughout Japanese history, famous leaders have often been buried in tombs. The oldest known burial chamber was built between 220 and 230 CE in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture, and called the &quot;Hokenoyama tomb&quot;. The tomb is 80 m long, and the chamber is 7 m long and 2.7 m wide, and contained a coffin 5 m long and 1 m wide. It is not known exactly who is buried there, but it is presumed to be a powerful local leader.

Around 300, the use of burial mounds for important leaders became more frequent. Japan developed its unique keyhole-shaped burial mounds, which are called &quot;Kofun&quot; (古墳 - the word is used for burial mounds of all shapes), and the period from 250 to 538 is called the Kofun period. Although 50 years ago it was believed that these mounds had initially been influenced by burial mounds in China via the Korean peninsula, Yayoi-period mounds are generally regarded as their predecessors. It is now believed that burial mounds of Korea built in the 5th and 6th centuries may have been influenced by the &quot;kofun&quot; of Japan.

There are numerous burial mounds within the geographical range of ancient Yamato-culture, most of which have keyhole-shaped outlines and which measure up to 400 m. The largest is the tomb of Emperor Nintoku in Sakai near Osaka, with a length of 486 m. and covering an area of 300,000 square meters. They are usually surrounded by moats, unless they are constructed on hills. The round halves of these burial mounds contain burial chambers. In the 6th century, round and square burial mounds came into use. The use of burial mounds is believed to have gradually stopped either with the introduction of Buddhism in Japan in the sixth century AD or with the establishment of the capital in Nara by Empress Genmei in 710. Instead, family tombs were constructed with passages that allow additional burials of relatives. Traditionally, the handling of deceased was considered unclean business and was usually done by Burakumin.

===Medieval Sōtō Zen funerals===
Japanese Buddhist funerals, which make up the vast majority of Japanese funerals today, are generally performed in what was historically the Sōtō Zen style, although today the Sōtō funerary rites have come to define the standard funeral format by most of the other Japanese Buddhist schools. Japanese Zen funeral rites came directly from Chinese Chan funeral rites, which were detailed in the &quot;Chanyuan Qinggui&quot; (禪院清規, “the pure regulations of the Zen monastery”). The major difference between the earlier Chinese Chan funerals and Japanese Sōtō Zen funerals was that early Japanese monks made no distinction between a monastic funeral for an abbot and the funeral service for a layperson. The first Japanese laypeople to receive Zen funerals were among the ruling elite who sponsored the activities of Zen institutions. One early example of this is the Regent Hōjō Tokimune, who received monastic funeral rites in 1284 at the hands of Chinese monk Wuxue Zuyan. Zen historian Martin Collcutt asserts that “one means by which Zen monks extended their influence in society was by the conduct of funeral services for important patrons.” By the medieval Sōtō period, only a small percentage of the funeral sermons recorded were delivered for members of the monastic order.

The progressive changes in Sōtō Zen funeral rites were not enacted by its founder, Dōgen, but came about years later when Zen master Keizan encouraged Zen monks to go out into the countryside and perform funeral services for the laity. Although Dōgen was the first to implement many aspects of Chinese Chan monastic codes in Japan, his &quot;gogoku&quot; doesn&#x27;t contain any funeral sermons. At this point in Japanese history, different schools of Zen were in competition for followers, and they were “more conscious than ever before of the necessity of making available to the laity such rites as funeral services and ancestor worship.” Keizan&#x27;s inclusive attitudes toward funerals resulted in the building of many temples in rural areas and the gradual expansion of the Sōtō order throughout Japan.

The funeral service that became popular for the Japanese laity in the medieval period was essentially the Chinese Chan service specified for the ordinary monk. The most important phases of this type of Zen funeral were: posthumous ordination, the sermon at the side of the corpse, the circumambulation of the coffin around the cremation ground, and the lighting of the funeral pyre. For a layperson, the posthumous ordination part of the ritual was the most vital, because without ordaining the deceased as a Zen monk, the other funeral rites could not be performed, since Zen funeral rites did not previously exist for laypeople, but only for monks. Once posthumous ordination of the laity was accepted by the Sōtō school, lay funeral practices became possible; today, death rituals mark the central practice at Sōtō Zen parish temples. This practice was one of the first few elements of Sōtō Zen that was standardized by the early Tokugawa period. Since the popularization of Sōtō Zen in medieval Japan, Sōtō Zen funeral practices have been a significant point of contact between the monks and laity, and continue to play an important role in lay religious life today.

===Today===
Until the early 20th century most bodies were buried and cremation was limited to the wealthy. Cremation became more common after World War II due to its efficiency and cleanliness; in fiscal 2009, 99.9% of Japanese bodies were cremated, and some local governments ban burials.

In a break of tradition from the early Edo period to align with modernity, it has been decided that Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko will be cremated after their death instead of ritual burials.

<doc id="642348" wikidata="Q529977" url="?curid=642348" title="Shamian">
<text>Shamian (also romanized as Shameen or Shamin, both from its Cantonese pronunciation) is a sandbank island in the Liwan District of Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. The island&#x27;s name literally means &quot;sandy surface&quot; in Chinese.

The territory was divided into two concessions given to France and the United Kingdom by the Qing government in the 19th century (1859–1943). The island is a gazetted historical area that serves as a tranquil reminder of the colonial European period, with quiet pedestrian avenues flanked by trees and lined by historical buildings in various states of upkeep. The island is the location of several hotels, a youth hostel, restaurants and tourist shops selling curios and souvenirs.
==Geography==
The island covers an area of 0.3 km2, 900 m from east to west, and 300 m from north to south. It is bordered in the south by the Pearl River, and it is separated from the mainland by a canal.

==History==
Shamian Island was an important port for Guangzhou&#x27;s foreign trade from the Song to the Qing dynasty. From the 18th to the mid 19th century, the foreigners lived and did business in a row of houses known as the Thirteen Factories, on the banks of the Pearl River to the east the present Shamian, which was then an anchorage for thousands of boat people. In 1859, Great Britain and France dug an artificial river (now called Shajichong) to the north, making it an island. Since then, Shamian became a strategic point for city defense during the First and Second Opium Wars. The British captured the Shamian Fort in the Canton River operations in March 1841 during the First Opium War. In the 1847 expedition to Canton, they seized the Shamian batteries along with the rest of the forts guarding the city. In the first armed conflict of the Second Opium War, the British recaptured the forts in 1856.

In 1859, the territory was divided in two concessions given to France and the United Kingdom (of which 3/5 belonged to the British and 2/5 to the French). It was connected to the mainland by two bridges, which were closed at 10pm as a security measure. The British arch bridge, also called the &quot;Bridge of England&quot; and built in 1861, to the north was guarded by Sikh police officers, and the French bridge to the east was guarded by Vietnamese (Cochinchina) recruits with the Troupes coloniales.

Trading companies from Britain, the United States, France, Holland, Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Japan built stone mansions along the waterfront. The construction on the island was characterized by climate-adapted but Western-plan detached houses with hipped roofs and large verandahs.

The island was the scene of fighting during the &quot;June 23 incident&quot; in 1925.

After 1949, the mansions of Shamian became government offices or apartment houses and the churches were turned into factories.

==Features==

===Religious buildings===
The French Catholic chapel, Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel (), has been restored and stands on the main boulevard. Located at the French end of the island, it was completed in 1892.

The British Protestant church, Christ Church Shameen (), was built in 1865.

===Government===
The community includes the Shamian Police Station ().

===Consulates===
While Shamian Island in history housed the majority of the consulates in Guangzhou, all have since moved out except the consulate general of Poland which remains at No. 63 Shamian Main Street.

Former consulates on the Island include:
* Czechoslovakia. The Czech Consulate was for some time located at No. 1 North Shamian Street, in a 1911 building, which later hosted the North Korean trade delegation in Guangzhou.
* France. No. 20 South Shamian Street.
* Poland. No. 63 Shamian Main Street.
* Germany. No. 59 Shamian Main Street South. The building also housed the Asiatic Petroleum Company.
* Japan. No. 22 South Shamian Street.
* Norway. No. 54 Shamian Main Street North.
* Portugal. No. 42 South Shamian Street.
* Soviet Union. The Soviet Consulate was for some time located at 68 Shamian Main Street North, in a 1916 building.
* United Kingdom. No. 44-46 South Shamian Street.
* United States. The U.S. Consulate Guangzhou was located at No. 56 Shamian Main Street North from 1873 to 1938, and later during several months in 1949. In April 1990, the consulate moved again to Shamian Island, where it occupied the Consulate Tower, a new building at No. 1 Shamian South Street, built on reclaimed land near the Pearl River and next to the White Swan Hotel. In 2005, the Consular Section of the Consulate moved to a location in Tianhe District. In July 2013, the consulate was relocated to a new building within Zhujiang New Town. The consulate&#x27;s location made Shamian Island a hub for U.S. families adopting children from China.

===Education===
Schools in the community include Shamian Primary School () and Shamian Experimental Primary School ().

===Recreation===
Shamian Park () and the Shamian Tennis Courts () are in the community.

===Statues===

Various bronze statues are scattered around the island which depict life as it was during earlier periods on the island, as well as from more recent times. For example, one statue entitled &quot;A gentleman, a lady and a darn woman&quot; shows a Western couple watching a Chinese woman darning cloth. Another depicts the changing appearances and stature of Chinese women, with a woman from colonial times in traditional clothing, a slightly taller woman from the early or mid 20th century wearing a cheongsam, and a relatively tall and slender young Chinese woman wearing shorts and talking on a mobile phone.

==Transportation==
The three east–west streets of the island, formerly named &quot;Canal Street&quot;, &quot;Central Avenue&quot; (a tree-lined boulevard), and &quot;Front Avenue&quot; (originally lined on the riverside by parks) were renamed &quot;Shamian North Road&quot; (Shamian Beijie), &quot;Shamian Main Street&quot; (Shamian Dajie), and &quot;Shamian South Road&quot; (Shamian Nanjie). The five north–south streets are named Shamian 1 Street to Shamian 5 Street.

Huangsha Station of Guangzhou Metro is located within a short walk from the island, via an overpass crossing the busy Liu&#x27;ersan Road. There is also a ferry running from Huangsha Pier to Fangcun Pier, which runs every 10 minutes carrying foot-passengers and bicycles. Fares are from 0.5 RMB for a foot passenger and 1 RMB for a passenger with a bike. There are no public buses on the island itself, although there are several nearby bus stops.

<doc id="642351" wikidata="Q645514" url="?curid=642351" title="First Love (Hikaru Utada album)">
<text>First Love is the debut Japanese-language studio album (second overall) by Japanese-American recording artist Hikaru Utada, released on March 10, 1999, by Eastworld.

An R&amp;B and dance-pop album, &quot;First Love&quot; centres on the theme of love and relationships. The songs were written and recorded over the course of about one year, between the end of Utada&#x27;s 14th year and the end of her 15th year. Critics&#x27; opinions of the album were generally favourable, praising Utada&#x27;s songwriting and vocal delivery. In its first week of release, the album entered the Oricon Albums Chart at number one with over two million units sold. Since its release, &quot;First Love&quot; remains the highest-selling Japanese album with nationwide sales of 8 million copies. It has also sold over 9.91 million units worldwide, making it the highest-selling album in Asian music history. Due to its enormous sales and revolutionary nature, the album is still presented as a milestone in the history of Japanese pop music.

Utada promoted the album by releasing three singles: &quot;Automatic/Time Will Tell,&quot; &quot;Movin&#x27; on Without You&quot; and the title track, all which were accompanied by a music video. She performed several tracks from the album on several television appearances in 1998 and 1999, and have performed songs on her and Wild Life tours. &quot;Automatic/time will tell&quot; and &quot;First Love&quot; are her best-selling CD single and album respectively. Exactly fifteen years after its premiere, a 2014 re-issue of the album was released, featuring a bonus live DVD and the special edition featured two additional discs.

==Background==

Born and raised in Manhattan, New York City, Utada started singing at a very young age; she was a member of U, a musical act with her mother Keiko Fuji and her father Teruzane Utada. U released their debut album &quot;Star&quot; in 1993, with the hope to debut in America; the album only peaked at thirty-three in Japan. Utada&#x27;s mother was a Japanese enka singer and actress, while her father was a Japanese record producer who had contributed to some of Fuji&#x27;s work. In 1996, the group was re-branded as Cubic U, an R&amp;B project that focused primarily on Hikaru, resulting in the English language album &quot;Precious&quot; in 1998 with record label Toshiba EMI. &quot;Precious&quot; was originally scheduled to be released simultaneously in Japan and the United States, but due to EMI&#x27;s internal restructuring issues, this album was not released in the United States and was only released in Japan. 8,000 copies were shipped in Japan at the time of its release, but on March 31, 1999, the album was re-released with a new jacket. At the time of the reissue, &quot;First Love&quot;, the first album under Hikaru Utada&#x27;s name released three weeks earlier, had become an unprecedented hit, and the reissued version of &quot;Precious&quot; also attracted attention, selling approximately 700,000 copies according to Oricon.

Utada relocated to Tokyo in early 1997 to attend Seisen International School and American School in Japan. During her studies, Utada signed as a solo artist with Toshiba EMI and began recording her album &quot;First Love&quot;. Fluent in both English and Japanese languages, the head offices at EMI asked if she could write Japanese songs rather than English lyrics. During the process of the album, Utada desired to become a singer-songwriter and occasionally practised producing and composing her music rather than becoming a Japanese idol. She refused to allow talent agencies to contact her at the start, which was a very common tradition for Japanese singers in the 1990s, and her father started to manage her work along with producing and composing it; to this day, her father continues to manage and co-produce some of her work. Aaliyah&#x27;s album &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot; was the inspiration for Utada&#x27;s fascination with rhythm and blues music, and she described Aaliyah&#x27;s album as her rhythm and blues roots. Aaliyah&#x27;s soft, murmuring vocals also influenced Utada&#x27;s future singing style.

==Production and composition==
Due to Utada&#x27;s dedication to her studies, recording was only done on weekends. First, Utada consulted with an arranger to create the sound, and then wrote melodies and lyrics while playing loops of the tracks. In her blog at the time of the album&#x27;s release, Utada wrote that the &quot;ingredients&quot; for the songs were &quot;Utada Hikaru, a computer, an MD player (recording type), time, a desire to express (the most important), and a deadline (laughs).&quot; The lyrics to the tracks from &quot;First Love&quot; are written primarily in Japanese by Utada and featured interspersed English-language phrases. Utada&#x27;s father Teruzane and Akira Miyake served as the album&#x27;s primary producers alongside Hikaru; Saito Masaaki, Nakasone Junya, Sanada Yoshiaki and Okamoto Tatsyua served as the album&#x27;s executive producers. Utada contributed to editing and producing her recorded vocals for all the tracks. The tracks from &quot;First Love&quot; were recorded in studios across her native New York City, Los Angeles and Tokyo. American producer and mixer Ted Jensen had mixed the tracks at Sterling Sound Studios in New York.

The album&#x27;s opener &quot;Automatic&quot; is an R&amp;B and dance-pop song that talks about a previous relationship. &quot;Rockin&#x27; On Japan&quot;&#x27;s editor and chief Kano had commented that Utada had brought a large prominence of R&amp;B and soul music with the tracks &quot;Automatic&quot; and &quot;Time Will Tell&quot;, and felt that &quot;Automatic&quot;&#x27;s release introduced a new R&amp;B audience inside of Japan. The title track is a power ballad conveying slow and off-key vocals that complimented the music to the album.

&quot;Movin&#x27; on Without You&quot; is a disco and house-inspired track that was influenced by the early 1990s dance music throughout the Western part of the world and lasts a duration of four minutes and forty-one seconds. &quot;B&amp;C&quot;, a funk song, was featured as a B-side to the physical CD format from &quot;Movin&#x27; on Without You&quot;. The story of Adam and Eve was suggested as an idea for a song about a famous couple, but Utada said, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t seem like me,&quot; and &quot;I didn&#x27;t like it because it symbolizes gender discrimination in the West,&quot; so she decided on Bonnie and Clyde, which are heroes of both sexes for Utada, and &quot;B&amp;C&quot; was created. The album closer &quot;Give Me a Reason&quot; is a trip hop song. &quot;Interlude&quot; was produced into a song called &quot;Kotoba ni Naranai Kimochi&quot; on Utada&#x27;s &quot;Distance&quot; album.

==Release==
&quot;First Love&quot; was released on March 10, 1999, by Toshiba EMI. The album was released as a compact disc and a double vinyl. The vinyl was exclusively released in North America and Japan by Eastworld Records. &quot;First Love&quot; was released in the Philippines by OctoArts EMI Music. It was released in South Korea and Indonesia by Eastworld and EMI.

After fifteen years of its release, &quot;First Love&quot; was re-released by Universal Music Japan on March 10, 2014, in two separate versions. The normal version is a two-disc set featuring a remastered version of the normal album along with a second disc featuring Utada&#x27;s previously unreleased &quot;LUV LIVE&quot; concert. The remastering was done by Ted Jensen. The other version is a limited edition 4-disc set, containing the remastered track list on disc one, &quot;LUV LIVE&quot; concert on disc two, as well as featuring a disc containing karaoke tracks and the last containing a multitude of demos from the &quot;First Love&quot; era of Utada&#x27;s career. The deluxe edition also carries with it memorabilia from that time, including a hard cover booklet filled with unreleased photoshoots, handwritten lyrics, promotional items as well as replicas of the tickets and backstage passes to her &quot;LUV LIVE&quot; concert. The Deluxe Edition initially was limited to 5,000 copies, however, due to overwhelming demand, this was pushed to 10,000 after the initial 5,000 units were sold almost instantly.

==Singles==
The double A-side single &quot;Automatic/Time Will Tell&quot; was released on December 9, 1998, as an 8cm mini CD single and 12cm CD single. The songs received positive reviews, being highlighted as album stand outs. &quot;Automatic&quot; was given the gold award at the 2000 JASRAC awards, beating her own song &quot;Time Will Tell&quot; and &quot;Dango 3 Kyodai&quot; to be the most royalty-receiving song in 1999. The Japan Record Awards mentioned the song as an Honorable Mention Award. In 2000, The Japan Gold Disc Awards had awarded &quot;Automatic&quot; along with &quot;Movin&#x27; on Without You&quot; and &quot;Addicted to You&quot; for Song(s) of the Year. &quot;Automatic/Time Will Tell&quot; peaked at number four and number two on the Oricon Singles Chart in their respective formats. With both formats combined, &quot;Automatic/Time Will Tell&quot; has sold over 2.06 million units in Japan, making it her best-selling physical single, the second best-selling single by a female Japanese soloist and the nineteenth best-selling single in Japan overall.

The second single &quot;Movin&#x27; on Without You&quot; was released on February 17, 1999, as a 8cm single and a 12cm single. It served as the commercial song for the Nissan Terrano. The song received positive reviews, many of which highlighted the song as an album stand out. The 8cm single reached number five on the Oricon Singles Chart. The 12cm single reached number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, marking this her first number one. This edition of the single was certified million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. &quot;Movin&#x27; on Without You&quot; was her most well-known song in the West before her rise in popularity through &quot;Simple And Clean.&quot;

The third and final single &quot;First Love&quot; was released on April 28, 1999, as a 8cm mini CD and a 12cm standard CD. &quot;First Love&quot; was used as the theme song for the dorama &quot;Majo no Jōken&quot;, starring Hideaki Takizawa and Nanako Matsushima. The song received positive reviews, many of which highlighted the song as an album stand out. The 12cm standard CD single of &quot;First Love&quot; peaked at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart, missing the top spot but was certified double platinum by the RIAJ for shipments of 800,000 units in Japan. The 8cm CD version reached number six. At the end of the year, &quot;First Love&quot; became the annual number one song on Taiwan&#x27;s Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year chart for 1999. &quot;First Love&quot; was also adopted as the marching song for the Spring 2000 National High School Baseball Tournament.

==Reception==
Music critics complimented &quot;First Love&quot;. Tomoyuki Mori of Amazon praised the album for its heartfelt lyrics and said that her voice is rich in emotional expression. Japanese magazine CDJournal felt Utada&#x27;s singing voice and musical style was very heartfelt.

Tower Records described the album as &quot;an epoch-making work that played a pioneering role in completely changing the concept of popular music in Japan.&quot; Music critic Yoichi Shibuya commented that the album was &quot;different to anything Japanese pop music had produced up until now, with a very high quality and international appeal,&quot; and that he felt that &quot;the DNA of Japanese pop music has changed.&quot; He also commented on the album&#x27;s sudden astronomical sales, saying that it &quot;achieved a combination of revolutionary quality and popularity that had previously been thought impossible.&quot;

In a 2016 article, OKMusic&#x27;s Tomoyuki Hokari noted Utada&#x27;s way of putting words to melody in her work. He praised Utada&#x27;s &quot;seamless use of words, which makes the most of her unique bilingualism (she is a native speaker of both Japanese and English) - or perhaps even unaware of it - as one of the great inventions in the history of Japanese entertainment,&quot; adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anything has yet emerged that surpasses this invention, at least in terms of publicly recognized methods and techniques. I don&#x27;t think anything has yet emerged that surpasses this invention, at least in terms of methods and techniques recognized by the public.&quot; Music Magazine&#x27;s Yumiko Kakoi commented that &quot;she has successfully and unconsciously made the best parts of R&amp;B and songs into her own.&quot; Tomoo Yamaguchi, also of Music Magazine, commented, &quot;The fact that there is nothing obnoxious about her music or singing ability shows the size of her capacity.&quot;

==Commercial performance and legacy==

&quot;First Love&quot; entered the Oricon Albums Chart at number one with 2,026,870 units sold. The album sold over five million copies in a month in March and April of 1999 and placed Utada among the 100 wealthiest people in Japan. By the time the album reached its eighth week on the chart on May 10, 1999, cumulative sales had reached 5.239 million copies, making it the best-selling album of all time in Japan. Sales continued to skyrocket, with &quot;First Love&quot; reaching sales of six million copies on May 31, 1999, the first time in Oricon history that an album has sold more than six million copies. Furthermore, by August 16, 1999, it had sold over seven million copies, making it the number one album of the year and made Utada the year&#x27;s number one artist in revenue sales, earning revenue sales of ¥28.12 billion (approximately US$182,900,269). &quot;First Love&quot; stayed at number one for six nonconsecutive weeks and stayed in the top 300 of the chart for 93 weeks in total. Oricon named &quot;First Love&quot; the best-performing album of 1999 in Japan, with 7,365,830 copies sold by the end of the fiscal year. According to Oricon, the cumulative sales of 7.65 million copies is the highest album sales in Japan ever.

According to karao.com&#x27;s statistics, over 8.13 million copies were sold by the end of the year. To date, over 8.7 million copies have been shipped in Japan and over 9.91 million copies worldwide. &quot;First Love&quot; is the only album or physical record to have been certified octuple million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), which is equivalent to being certified 32x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The sales of &quot;First Love&quot; helped it overtake B&#x27;z&#x27;s &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Pleasure&quot;&quot; as history&#x27;s highest-selling Japanese album. On August 10, 1999, Toshiba EMI announced that total shipments in Japan had surpassed eight million copies. Alongside its success at home, &quot;First Love&quot; also sold 500,000 copies in Taiwan, making it the highest-selling Japanese album in Taiwan&#x27;s music history.

By the end of 1999, Utada was ranked 5th on Japanese radio station Tokio Hot 100 Airplay&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Artists of the 20th Century&quot; by the station and its listeners. In September 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone Japan&quot; ranked &quot;First Love&quot; No.99 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;First Love&quot; is the seventh album to claim the highest weekly sales in Japan, behind her 2001 album &quot;Distance&quot; and 2002 album &quot;Deep River&quot;.

<doc id="642352" wikidata="Q614999" url="?curid=642352" title="Big Brother Recordings">
<text>Big Brother Recordings Ltd. is a British record label set up in 2000 to release material by rock band Oasis in the UK and Ireland. On 19 June 2008 a deal was signed with Sony BMG which entitled them to an arranged portion of the profits from the next three Oasis studio albums to be released through Big Brother. The name of the company is a reference to the band&#x27;s guitarist, singer and songwriter Noel Gallagher, who is the older brother of lead singer Liam Gallagher. The catalogue number of each release begins with &quot;RKID&quot;, which stands for &quot;our kid&quot;; Northern England slang to refer to a brother.

The imprint was started after Alan McGee announced on 25 November 1999 that he was leaving Creation Records, Oasis&#x27; original record company. The first release on Big Brother was the single &quot;Go Let It Out&quot; (catalogue number &#x27;RKID 001&#x27;) on 7 February 2000, the lead single from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot;. On 14 August 2000, all of Oasis&#x27;s singles from &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; and &quot;Be Here Now&quot; were re-issued on the Big Brother label and given new RKID catalogue numbers. In 2005, British band Happy Mondays released their first new material in over 13 years on the Big Brother label, with the single &quot;Playground Superstar&quot;.

In addition to Big Brother Recordings, Noel Gallagher has &quot;Sour Mash Records&quot;, a label founded in 2001, who has signed Proud Mary (band from Royton) and Shack (band formed in Liverpool).

Big Brother were reported to be buying back the rights to Oasis&#x27; back catalogue from Sony BMG, who took complete control of Creation Records in 2000. The new deal signed with Sony means this process is on hold for the foreseeable future.

In September 2007, Oasis signed a record deal with Universal Music Group, and the &quot;Lord Don&#x27;t Slow Me Down&quot; DVD was released by Big Brother Recordings Ltd. in United Kingdom, and Big Brother Recordings Ltd./Universal Music internationally. Also released was their first ever digital only single on 21 October 2007, &quot;Lord Don&#x27;t Slow Me Down&quot;.

On 30 July 2008, Reprise Records announced that it has signed a North American distribution deal with Big Brother Recordings. The first new release under the deal was &quot;Dig Out Your Soul,&quot; in October 2008.

The logo of the label, pictured above, appeared on the back of the white piano that Jay Darlington played at the Oasis concerts. It can be seen on the live performance second disc of &quot;Lord Don&#x27;t Slow Me Down&quot;.

Appointed the7stars as their media planning and buying agency in 2007.

<text>Miikka Sakari Kiprusoff (; born October 26, 1976), nicknamed &quot;Kipper&quot;, is a Finnish former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League for the San Jose Sharks and Calgary Flames between 2000 and 2013. He was selected in the fifth round, 116th overall, by the Sharks in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, and has also played professionally for TPS of the Finnish SM-liiga, as well as for both AIK IF and Timrå IK of the Swedish Elitserien.

Kiprusoff represented Finland several times on the international stage, earning silver medals at the Ice Hockey World Championships in 1999 and 2001, as well as leading the Finns to a surprise second-place finish at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. He also helped the Finnish national team win the bronze medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics.

Kiprusoff began his professional career with TPS in 1994, and was named the best goaltender and best player of the playoffs in 1999 as he led them to the SM-liiga championship. He then moved to North America in 1999, and after two All-Star seasons in the American Hockey League (AHL), made his NHL debut with the San Jose Sharks, where he served primarily as the team&#x27;s backup. A trade to the Calgary Flames in 2003–04 brought Kiprusoff into a starting role, and he set a modern NHL record for lowest goals against average (GAA) at 1.69 as he helped the Flames reach the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals. He won the Vezina Trophy as the best goaltender in the NHL in 2006 along with the William M. Jennings Trophy for giving up the fewest goals in the League. He played in his first NHL All-Star Game in 2007. Having won over 300 games after turning 27, he is the franchise record holder in both wins and shutouts for the Flames.

==Playing career==

===Europe===
Kiprusoff was sponsored by his hometown team. TPS, playing two seasons in the Finnish junior league for them between 1993 and 1995. He was then selected by the San Jose Sharks in the fifth round, 116th overall, at the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He made his professional debut in 1994–95, and won three of four games played for TPS. After playing 12 games for TPS in 1995–96, he moved to AIK IF of the Swedish Elitserien, playing two seasons as their top goaltender before returning to TPS in 1998–99. He dominated the SM-liiga that year, finishing the season with a record of 26–6–6 and a GAA of 1.85, and led TPS to the Finnish championship. For his efforts, he was named the winner of the Urpo Ylönen trophy as the best goaltender in 1998–99 and the Jari Kurri trophy as the best player of the playoffs.

===San Jose Sharks (2000–2003)===

Kiprusoff moved to North America in 1999, joining the Sharks&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Kentucky Thoroughblades. He finished fourth in the League with a 2.48 GAA and was the starting goaltender for team PlanetUSA at the 2000 AHL All-Star Game as he helped Kentucky win its first division title. He began the 2000–01 season with Kentucky, where he posted a record of 19–9–6 with two shutouts in 39 games. He then started his second-consecutive AHL All-Star Game before earning a call-up to San Jose on March 5, 2001. He earned his first NHL win on March 29, 7–4 over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, in relief of starting goaltender Evgeni Nabokov. He made his first start on April 8, again against Anaheim, and earned his second win.

The flu sidelined Nabokov for Game 4 of the Sharks&#x27; 2001 Stanley Cup playoff series against the St. Louis Blues. Making just his second career start, Kiprusoff made 39 saves in a 3–2 victory. In doing so, he became the first Finnish born goaltender to win an NHL playoff game. Kiprusoff struggled to start the 2001–02 season, however, and was sent to the Cleveland Barons on a conditioning assignment after playing in only four of the Sharks&#x27; first 21 games. He was named the AHL Player of the Week during the assignment after winning all four games he played in Cleveland. He finished the season with a 7–6–3 record for the Sharks, and recorded his first NHL shutout in a 6–0 win over the Florida Panthers on January 5, 2002.

Nabokov entered the 2002–03 season as a holdout player without a contract, giving Kiprusoff a chance to become the starter. Despite the opportunity, Kiprusoff struggled, losing his first three games and posting a 5.65 GAA in that time, forcing the Sharks&#x27; hand, as they quickly agreed to terms with Nabokov on a new contract. Relegated to the backup role, Kiprusoff continued to struggle, winning just five of 22 games played before his season ended with a knee injury. Despite his poor season, the Sharks offered him a new contract for one year at US$800,000.

Kiprusoff began the 2003–04 season competing with Vesa Toskala for the backup spot behind Nabokov, leading to speculation of a trade. Ultimately relegated to third-string status, Kiprusoff grew increasingly frustrated, as he did not play in any games through the first quarter of the season. He was then finally traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for a second-round draft pick on November 16, 2003, after Calgary starter Roman Turek suffered an injury.

===Calgary Flames (2003–2013)===

The trade provided immediate dividends for the Flames, as Kiprusoff recorded 22 saves in a 2–1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens in his first game with Calgary on November 20. He won 12 of 17 starts between November 20 and December 29, giving up one goal or fewer 11 times in that stretch. He was named the defensive player of the month for December by the League, but suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his knee at the end of the month that forced him out of the lineup for four weeks.

Kiprusoff&#x27;s play remained strong upon his return, as he was counted on to lead the Flames to the playoffs for the first time in eight years. A 1–0 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes clinched a berth in the 2004 playoffs for the Flames, an achievement which earned Kiprusoff a standing ovation from the Calgary fans. He finished the regular season with a modern NHL record-low GAA of 1.69. His stellar play continued into the playoffs, as he won 15 games, five of them via shutout, leading the Flames to within one victory of a Stanley Cup championship. He was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the best goaltender in the League, and was given a one-year, $2.95 million contract for 2004–05 by an arbitrator, an increase in salary of nearly four times his previous contract.

As the 2004–05 lockout led to the cancellation of the season, Kiprusoff chose to play in Sweden. He played 41 games for Timrå IK, recording five shutouts and a 2.14 GAA. He remained a top goaltender for Calgary when NHL play resumed in 2005–06, breaking Mike Vernon&#x27;s franchise record when he recorded his 40th win of the season against the Minnesota Wild on April 8, 2006. He was not only touted as the top goaltender in the League, but also argued to be a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player in the NHL. Finishing the season with a 42–20–11 record and a team-record 10 shutouts, he was named a first team all-star and awarded the Vezina Trophy, as well as the William M. Jennings Trophy for being the goaltender on the team that gave up the fewest goals in during the season. He was also named a finalist for the Hart, though the award was won by Joe Thornton.
Kiprusoff struggled to begin the 2006–07 season, winning just four of his first 12 decisions, and giving up nearly three goals per game. He rebounded to finish the season with 40 wins, won his 100th career game, and played in his first All-Star Game. He recorded his 21st shutout in a Flames uniform in a 1–0 win over the Wild on March 27, 2007, to break Dan Bouchard&#x27;s franchise record. Kiprusoff was outstanding in the 2007 playoffs, keeping the overmatched Flames close to the top-seeded Detroit Red Wings despite the Flames giving up nearly 50 shots per game in their first two contests. He led them to consecutive wins in Games 3 and 4 to even the series, and gave the Flames hope they could win the series, but the Flames were unable to parlay his performance into a series win, losing the best-of-seven series 4–2. In Game 5, he was pulled after giving up five goals, but was forced to come back in only 18 seconds later when his backup, Jamie McLennan, was thrown out of the game for deliberately slashing the Red Wings&#x27; Johan Franzén. Kiprusoff earned his third consecutive nomination for the Vezina Trophy, ultimately won by Martin Brodeur.

Nicknamed &quot;Captain Hook&quot; for the way he handled goaltenders, the Flames decision to hire Mike Keenan as head coach in 2007–08 created speculation that Kiprusoff might choose to leave Calgary when his contract expired at the end of the season. Nonetheless, he agreed to a six-year extension worth $35 million that would keep him in Calgary until the end of the 2013–14 season. He struggled at times, as his GAA and save percentage fell outside of the top 30 goaltenders in the League by mid-November. His play improved throughout the season, however, and he finished the season third in the NHL with 39 wins.

Hoping to rebound in 2008–09, Kiprusoff arrived for the start of the season in better shape, but continued to struggle as he was questioned on whether his heavy workload the previous three seasons — he played 76, 74 and 74 games of a possible 82 — were taking a toll on him. He won his 200th career game on March 18, 2009, in a 2–1 victory over the Dallas Stars, but questions about whether he was playing too many games continued throughout the season. Although he led the League with 45 wins, his statistical averages had deteriorated for the fourth consecutive season as he admitted he struggled.

New head coach Brent Sutter promised that Kiprusoff would face a lighter schedule in 2009–10, he played 76 games in 2008–09, while Kiprusoff hired a personal trainer and set aside his previously indifferent attitude towards off-season training. His efforts appeared to pay dividends early in the season, as he lost only three of his first 17 decisions, leading his teammates to compare his early performance to his first years in Calgary. He finished in the top ten in the League in wins, save percentage and GAA and while considered a potential candidate for the Vezina Trophy, he was not named a finalist in part due to the fact the Flames failed to qualify for the 2010 playoffs.

Kiprusoff, as well as the entire Flames team, struggled early in the 2010–11 season, and during a period of struggle late in January, he became a target of the fans&#x27; jeering. He admitted that he had struggled and was trying to focus on returning his play to where he felt it should be. Kiprusoff&#x27;s fortunes improved in February, as he won his 250th game as a member of the Flames in a 9–1 victory over the Colorado Avalanche on February 14. Six nights later, he became the first goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout in an outdoor game with a 4–0 victory over the Montreal Canadiens at the 2011 Heritage Classic. In a March 4 game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, he became the first goaltender in 25 years to stop two penalty shots in one game to preserve a 4–3 victory.

On February 8, 2012, Kiprusoff became the 27th goalie to record his 300th career win. He reached the mark with a 4–3 victory over his former team, the San Jose Sharks. A knee injury forced Kiprusoff out of Calgary&#x27;s lineup for a month of the 2012–13 season, but a victory in his return — a 4–1 decision over the Sharks on March 6, 2013 — marked his 300th win as a member of the Flames.

At the 2013 NHL trade deadline, the Toronto Maple Leafs reportedly attempted to acquire Kiprusoff, but he elected not to waive his no-trade clause amid speculation that he intended to retire at season&#x27;s end. Finnish news agency STT-Lehtikuva reported in June that the goaltender had informed the Finnish national team that he had decided to end his playing career, and the Flames formally announced his retirement on September 9, 2013. He ended his career as the Flames&#x27; franchise leader in wins (305), shutouts (41) and games played by a goaltender (576).

The Flames retired Kiprusoff&#x27;s no. 34 on March 2, 2024, making him the fourth Flames player to receive the honour.

==International play==

Kiprusoff made his international debut with the Finnish junior team at the 1994 European Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he played in three games. He was also a member of the team at the 1995 and 1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where Finland finished fourth and sixth, respectively.

Kiprusoff first played with the senior team at the 1999 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships, where he recorded a 1.16 GAA in four games, only to lose the final in overtime. He rejoined the team for the 2001 tournament, again losing the final in overtime.

Kiprusoff was offered a spot on the Finnish team for the 2002 Winter Olympics, but declined citing a desire to focus on his professional career in North America. Kiprusoff was named the starting goaltender for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and earned a shutout against the Czech Republic. He posted four wins and a tie, including a second shutout, and a 1.18 GAA to lead the upstart Finns into the championship game against Canada. In spite of his 30 saves, the Finns were defeated by Canada 3–2. Kiprusoff did not play his best game in the final, according to Finland Head Coach Raimo Summanen, though he expressed pride in his team&#x27;s effort.

Kiprusoff again declined an invitation to play at the 2006 Winter Olympics, citing the need to rest a hip injury. His announcement generated considerable controversy in Finland, where the fact that he did not miss a game with the Flames due to the injury led some to question if he was injured at all. Country-mate Teemu Selänne questioned the goaltender&#x27;s lack of interest in playing for the national team, a comment that stung Kiprusoff. When considered to play for the Finns at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Kiprusoff said he would join the team, but only if he felt healthy and if he was named the starting goaltender for the team. Kiprusoff was named the starter and allowed only four goals in his team&#x27;s first four games, leading the Finns to a semifinal game against the United States. The Americans blitzed Kiprusoff early in the game, as he gave up four goals on just seven shots in the first minutes of the game before being replaced in net by Niklas Bäckström. He returned to the net for the bronze medal game, however, leading Finland to a 5–3 victory.

==Personal life==
Kiprusoff is of Russian descent through his grandfather. He and his wife Seidi have two sons, Aaro and Oskar, and call Helsinki home. His older brother, Marko, is a defenceman who last played for TPS in 2009, and previously played in the NHL with the Montreal Canadiens and New York Islanders. Kiprusoff is a spokesman for the Rainbow Society of Alberta, an organization that aims to grant wishes for children with chronic or life-threatening conditions. He donated $10 for each save he made in an NHL game, which totalled $18,720 in 2009–10.

<doc id="642360" wikidata="Q6292462" url="?curid=642360" title="José Herrera (outfielder, born 1942)">
<text>José Concepción Herrera Ontiveros (April 8, 1942 – October 16, 2009) was a Venezuelan professional baseball player who appeared as an outfielder and second baseman in Major League Baseball for the Houston Astros (–) and Montreal Expos (–). He batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed .

==Career==
Born in San Lorenzo in Zulia, Herrera was signed by the Houston Colt .45s in 1964 as an amateur free agent and made his debut with the team on June 3, 1967, two years after it became the Astros. He was recalled after batting over .280 during his first three minor league seasons. It was an unusual debut: Houston third baseman Bob Aspromonte, facing future Baseball Hall of Famer Jim Bunning of the Philadelphia Phillies in the fifth inning, protested a strike two call and was ejected from the game by umpire Frank Secory; Herrera, called upon to pinch hit with a two-strike count already on him, struck out—with the &quot;K&quot; charged to Aspromonte. Herrera later made four more pinch-hitting appearances that June, collecting one single in four official at bats and one run batted in. In 1968, Herrera batted over .300 in Triple-A and was rewarded with a more extended call-up to Houston, appearing in 27 games, and starting in 16 games in the outfield and seven at second base. He hit .240 with five extra-base hits, and was not protected in the 1968 National League expansion draft. The Expos selected him with the 29th overall pick.

The 1969 season would see Herrera&#x27;s most extended MLB service. After hitting .301 in Triple-A, he appeared in 47 games for Montreal from June 17 through the end of the season, including 31 starts as an outfielder. He got off the mark quickly, batting over .350 into mid-August, and was still hitting .323 on September 1 with 11 multi-hit games, and his first two big-league home runs, struck July 24 and 26 against the Atlanta Braves at Fulton County Stadium. But he leveled off in September to finish at .286. Herrera had only one at bat on Opening Day 1970 at Crosley Field, Cincinnati, as a pinch hitter and struck out in his final MLB appearance.

He played six more years in the upper minors, including four in the Mexican League, before leaving the game in 1975.

In his MLB career of parts of four seasons, Herrera posted a .264 batting average with two home runs, 20 RBI, 16 runs, 61 hits, and ten doubles in 80 games played. He died in Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia, in his native country in 2009 at age 67.

<doc id="642367" wikidata="Q592659" url="?curid=642367" title="Musicology (album)">
<text>Musicology is the twenty-eighth studio album by American recording artist Prince. The album was given to concertgoers at his Musicology Tour, from March 27 to September 9, 2004, in North America. A digital release followed two days after his tour started on March 29, 2004. The physical retail version was released on April 19, 2004 (Europe) and April 20, 2004 (US) by NPG Records and distributed by Columbia Records. &quot;Musicology&quot; was the first album in five years (ten as Prince) that Prince released through a major label (Sony Music) and, being partially recorded in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, was his first to be recorded outside Minneapolis in many years. &quot;Musicology&quot; is R&amp;B-themed.

Receiving generally positive reviews from music critics, &quot;Musicology&quot; proved to be Prince&#x27;s most successful record in years, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reaching top 10 in ten other countries. It was Prince&#x27;s first album to chart in the US since &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; (2001).

Prince won Grammy Awards for Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;Musicology&quot; and Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;Call My Name&quot;. By January 2005, &quot;Musicology&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the time of release, Prince was quoted as saying he wished &quot;Musicology&quot; to provide musical education to listeners.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Musicology&quot; quickly proved to be Prince&#x27;s most successful album since &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot;, reaching the Top 5 in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany and making a significant impression on charts around the world. It also proved to be well received by music critics. The title track was released as a single in Australia and Europe, where it enjoyed moderate chart success and airplay. However it was also a hit on the US R&amp;B charts through airplay. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA in June 2004 and was certified double platinum in late January 2005.

Part of the album&#x27;s chart success was due to concertgoers receiving a copy of &quot;Musicology&quot;, with the album cost included in the ticket price for the Musicology Tour. This prompted &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine and Nielsen SoundScan to change its chart data methodology. For future album releases, &quot;Billboard&quot; said that customers &quot;must be given an option to either add the CD to the ticket purchase or forgo the CD for a reduced ticket-only price&quot;. A purple vinyl edition was released in February 2019.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Musicology&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Robert Christgau said that after the album&#x27;s opening uptempo songs, &quot;pleasant shocks lurk near the surface and go against the flow of the quality material, and almost everything packs payback&quot;. In a less enthusiastic review, &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine found it better produced and performed than it was written.

== Accolades ==
Prince won two Grammy Awards, for Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance (&quot;Musicology&quot;) and Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance—Male (&quot;Call My Name&quot;), and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance—Male (&quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;), Best R&amp;B Song (awarded to the songwriter) (&quot;Call My Name&quot;), and Best R&amp;B Album (&quot;Musicology&quot;). Prince was chosen by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers as the best male performer and most welcome comeback.

== Tour ==
Prince toured North America from March 27 to September 9, 2004 to promote &quot;Musicology&quot;. The tour was often billed as the Musicology Live 2004ever, or more commonly, the Musicology Tour. The tour earned $87.4 million and was attended by 1.47 million fans Although the tour promoted &quot;Musicology&quot;, only half of the tracks from the album were played during the concerts; the title track, &quot;Musicology&quot;, &quot;Call My Name&quot; Life &quot;O&quot; the Party, &quot;On the Couch&quot; and &quot;Dear Mr. Man&quot;. &quot;A Million Days&quot; was also performed, but only once. The tour featured many of Prince&#x27;s more famous tracks, such as &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;, &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, &quot;Kiss&quot;, and &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. A copy of &quot;Musicology&quot; was included with every concert ticket sold.

<doc id="642375" wikidata="Q2699535" url="?curid=642375" title="Distance (Hikaru Utada album)">
<text>Distance is the third studio album by Japanese singer Hikaru Utada. Toshiba EMI released it on March 28, 2001, making it her second release with the label. Utada wrote and co-produced the majority of the album, alongside previous collaborators Akira Miyake and her father Teruzane Utada, as well as new collaborations with American producers Rodney Jerkins and Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis. &quot;Distance&quot;, like its predecessor &quot;First Love&quot; (1999), is influenced by pop music and R&amp;B, with additional hip-hop, rock, reggae, and techno influences from Western music.

Music critics praised the overall sound and production quality of &quot;Distance&quot;, earning her numerous awards and recognitions as a result of its critical success. Prior to its release, &quot;Distance&quot; was scheduled to coincide with the release of Ayumi Hamasaki&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;A Best&quot; (2001), which Avex Trax had organised. This resulted in extensive coverage in both Japanese and Western music media. Despite its marketing and competition, &quot;Distance&quot; was a huge commercial success. It ascended to number one on the Oricon Albums Chart with the highest-ever first-week sales in music history until Adele&#x27;s &quot;25&quot; 14 years later, and eventually became the fourth best-selling album of all time in Japan.

To promote the album, Utada released four singles: &quot;Addicted to You,&quot; &quot;Wait &amp; See (Risk),&quot; &quot;For You / Time Limit&quot; and &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?.&quot; All four releases were successful in the Japanese market, selling over a million copies and becoming best-sellers. She promoted the album by performing two shows in Japan: Bohemian Summer 2000 and a special Unplugged event, both of which resulted in live releases. Furthermore, a video collection titled &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Clip Collection Vol. 2&quot; was released, which included all of the album&#x27;s music videos.

==Background and recording==
&quot;First Love&quot;, Utada&#x27;s major-label debut studio album, was released in March 1999 via Toshiba EMI. &quot;First Love&quot;, which she co-wrote and produced with her father Teruzane Utada and Akira Miyake, was a commercial success throughout the year, becoming the best-selling album in Japanese music history. With a string of successful singles, Utada quickly rose to prominence in Japan, where she was ranked fifth on the Tokyo Hot 100&#x27;s Top 100 Artists of the 20th Century, as voted on by stations and listeners. During the summer of 1999, her final summer vacation as a high school student, she performed a video concert called LUV LIVE REMIX ~hello from new york~, a charity concert called Soukenbicha Natural Breeze Concert &#x27;99 with TLC and Monica, made her first TV commercial appearance, and recorded a new song that was called “Addicted To You.”

&quot;Distance&quot; contains songs recorded between 1999 and 2001. During her last summer vacation as a high school student in 1999, Utada flew to Minneapolis and produced &quot;Addicted To You&quot; with Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, the production team that has worked with artists such as TLC and Janet Jackson. In both the United States and Japan, the producer&#x27;s influence is often more prominent than that of the artist, but in Minneapolis, Utada said that the production with them was on an equal footing, and that it was a &quot;ball of ideas.&quot; The follow-up, “Wait &amp; See (Risk),” was also produced by Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, but this time Utada was unable to make it to Minneapolis due to schoolwork; however, Utada even made an arrangement track for the song in the demo tape stage, which was retained in the actual arrangement, and Utada&#x27;s name was added to the arranger&#x27;s credits for the first time. Before her first national tour in 2000, she produced “Time Limit” with top producer Rodney Jerkins, one of the R&amp;B scene&#x27;s leading producers at the time. &quot;For You,” for which the melody was created before her debut, was also completed around this time. In addition, several of the recorded songs were created during the same tour. Utada said that live performances are not R&amp;B but rock, and those songs were also arranged with a rock flavor. The rest of the album&#x27;s songs were written and recorded in November of the same year, after her university exams were over, and were recorded over the New Years when her university was on winter vacation. When asked why she was not appearing on &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; at the time, Utada replied: &quot;Because I want to make an album.&quot;

On January 26, 2001, Utada announced on her official website that recording for the album &quot;Distance&quot; had been completed. Akira Miyake, who has been Utada&#x27;s producer since her debut, wrote a &quot;Post-Recording Notes&quot; on Utada&#x27;s official website on February 2, 2001, saying:

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;Distance&quot; expands on her previous studio album&#x27;s R&amp;B-influenced sound while also incorporating jazz, pop music, hip-hop, and rock elements. According to Ian Martin, writing for AllMusic, the tracks produced by Jerkins, Jam, and Lewis had a &quot;rich production&quot; as opposed to the &quot;cheap, tinny&quot; sound of Japanese pop at the time. &quot;Wait &amp; See (Risk)&quot; is a genuine US-style R&amp;B number with a sprinkling of funk and soul flavors. &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; was billed as a J-pop song with &quot;sophisticated&quot; songwriting and production standards. The album&#x27;s title track is a pop song that features twinkling beats, topped with a 90s-like piano melody and filled with breathy background vocals. &quot;Sunglasses&quot; is a medium-slow number that features an ensemble that intersects with a falsetto. &quot;Drama&quot; is a song that was written in collaboration with Takuro from Glay; it features brazenly strummed distortion guitars.

&quot;Eternally&quot; is a power ballad that sings about &quot;love&quot; and &quot;eternity&quot; head-on. &quot;Addicted to You&quot; is an authentic R&amp;B produced song that incorporates the &quot;chiki-chiki&quot; sound throughout. &quot;For You&quot; is an R&amp;B pop ballad. &quot;Kettobase!&quot; is a high-speed pop rock song with a punchy guitar rock sound that combines hard and sharp elements. &quot;Parody&quot; is a reggae-style song with phrases reminiscent of Sting&#x27;s &quot;Englishman in New York.&quot; &quot;Time Limit&quot; is medium tempo R&amp;B track. &quot;Kotoba ni Naranai Kimochi&quot; is an R&amp;B number with a funky bass line.

==Concept==
The album title was chosen because it was something Utada felt when interacting with others . Utada said she realized that her songs were about various types of &quot; distance,&quot; such as &quot;relationships between people, ways of interacting, ways of relating, and emotional distance.&quot; She also said that the word &quot;distance&quot; was a perfect fit, given that she had visited and been involved in the production of the album in a variety of places, from Tokyo to Osaka, Atlantic City, Minneapolis, New York, Miami, London, and Hong Kong. Utada also said the following about the title in an interview :

Utada says that the title track &quot;Distance&quot; brings together and connects all the themes of the lyrics of the other songs on the album. Utada believes that no matter how close you are to someone, even if they are your parents or lovers, no matter how much you understand each other, no matter how much you trust each other and how close you get to each other, &quot;in the end, you can&#x27;t become one,&quot; &quot;distance will always be created,&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s something that can&#x27;t be helped.&quot; In &quot;Distance,&quot; Utada said she wanted to portray the idea that &quot;you really need to acknowledge that distance and cherish it.&quot;

==Promotion==
On November 10, 1999, Toshiba EMI released the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Addicted to You&quot;. Two versions of the song were on the single: the &quot;Up-In-Heaven Mix&quot; and the &quot;Underwater Mix,&quot; though only the &quot;Up-In-Heaven Mix&quot; received radio airplay and its own music video. The song received high marks for its production quality and sound, with praise towards its producers Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis. Commercially, it reached number one on the Oricon Singles Chart and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of over 1.6 million. It is Utada&#x27;s second best-selling physical single behind &quot;Automatic/Time Will Tell,&quot; which sold a combined 2.06 million copies. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Wait &amp; See (Risk)&quot;, was released on April 19, 2000, with a physical edition that included a few B-side tracks and remixes. Critics also praised the single&#x27;s sound and production value. It reached number one on the Oricon Singles Chart and was the album&#x27;s second single to receive a quadruple RIAJ certification.

On June 30, 2000, the songs &quot;For You&quot; and &quot;Time Limit&quot; were packaged together and released as double A-side single. Both tracks had music videos, with Utada performing the song live. It received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart. The single was certified triple platinum by the RIAJ after shipping over 1.2 million units in Japan. The fourth and final single from the album, &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; debuted on February 16, 2001. &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; served as the theme song to the 2001 dorama &quot;Hero&quot;, in which Utada appeared as an actor. The song received positive reviews from publications and debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, earning her final triple platinum certification from the RIAJ. It also received platinum and gold certifications for exceeding 250,000 digital downloads and 50 million streams, respectively.

The song &quot;Distance&quot; was originally planned to be a single without any alterations, but it was instead released in a rearranged ballad form called &quot;Final Distance&quot; in memory of a fan who died in the June 2001 Ikeda school massacre; this new version would appear in her next album, &quot;Deep River&quot;. Utada performed two shows in Japan to promote the album. The first was the Bohemian Summer 2000 show, which was released live on December 9, 2000, several months before &quot;Distance&quot;. A special event called &quot;Utada Hikaru Unplugged&quot; began in 2001, followed by a live release on November 28, 2001. This footage was taken from the unplugged live performance that aired on MTV Japan on August 12, 2001, in front of an audience of about 120 people at Tennoz Studio. Furthermore, a video collection titled &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Clip Collection Vol. 2&quot; was released on September 27, 2001, which included all of the album&#x27;s music videos as well as behind-the-scenes footage for each video.

==Critical reception==

Ian Wade of AllMusic rated the album four stars. He praised the record&#x27;s production and songwriting, writing, &quot;&quot;Distance&quot; stands as one of Hikaru&#x27;s most consistent and inventive albums, and comes across as a far more convincing example of R&amp;B by a Japanese artist than their later attempts to crack the U.S. market.&quot; Music writer Tetsuo Hiraga of &quot;Hot Express&quot; praised &quot;Distance&quot; as “a work that expresses the dramatic ‘growth’ from &quot;First Love&quot; with the whole body,” and also pointed out the expansion of her musicality compared to her previous work. In his review of this album in &quot;Rockin&#x27;On Japan&quot;, Jun Shikano said, “Hikaru Utada&#x27;s music is soulful and reflects the heart. It is both universal and primal.&quot;

From 1999 to 2002, the album and several singles won Japan Gold Disc Awards. &quot;Distance&quot; won Best Rock &amp; Pop Album in 2002, and each of its four singles was named Song of the Year. The Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers (JASRAC Awards) honoured the album&#x27;s single &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; with the Silver Award. The song also won the International Viewer&#x27;s Award at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2002, as well as the Drama Song Award at the 2001 Television Drama Academy Awards.

==Release and commercial performance==

Toshiba EMI released &quot;Distance&quot; on March 28, 2001, marking her second release with the label. In Japan, it was initially available on CD, double vinyl, and cassette, each with thirteen tracks. EMI Music later released the album in several Asian countries, including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. &quot;Distance&quot; was re-released worldwide on January 23, 2019, via digital and streaming services, with a double vinyl edition re-issued in Japan by Universal Music on March 10, 2022.

Toshiba EMI had scheduled the album&#x27;s release date for March 28. At the same time, Japanese record label Avex Trax planned to release &quot;A Best&quot;, the greatest hits album by Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki. Avex&#x27;s strategy was to compete with Utada&#x27;s album, as both Hamasaki and Utada were at the peak of their popularity at the time. The announcement of both album release dates sparked widespread controversy in Japanese and Western media, with claims that the two singers were &quot;rivals&quot; in professional as well as personal circumstances. Both singers claimed it was a label-sponsored campaign, with Hamasaki expressing her displeasure over a lack of material and creative control of &quot;A Best&quot;.

Both albums received extensive promotion prior to their release on March 28, but both were extremely successful in terms of first-week sales. In Japan, &quot;Distance&quot; ascended to number one on the Oricon Albums Chart, while &quot;A Best&quot; debuted at number two. &quot;Distance&quot; sold 3,002,720 copies in its first week and became the fastest-selling album in music history, a record it held until 2015, when Adele&#x27;s third album &quot;25&quot; sold 3.4 million copies in its first week in the United States. It topped the charts for two nonconsecutive weeks while being dethroned by &quot;A Best&quot; in the second week. &quot;Distance&quot; had sold 4,404,290 units by the end of 2001, making it the best-selling album of the year, with &quot;A Best&quot; coming in second. Utada also topped the annual singles chart that year with “Can You Keep A Secret?” and dominated the singles and albums charts for the year.

The Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) certified the album quadruple million for selling more than four million copies, and Oricon reports that it sold more than 4.472 million in Japan. Oricon named it the best-selling Japanese album of the 2000s, and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) ranked it as the tenth best-selling record of 2001. The album is currently the fourth best-selling album in Japan, trailing only Glay&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;Review&quot; and B&#x27;z&#x27;s &quot;The Best&#x27;s &quot;Pleasure&quot;&quot; and Utada&#x27;s studio album &quot;First Love&quot;, the best-selling record in Japanese history.

<doc id="642377" wikidata="Q64956350" url="?curid=642377" title="Hôtel de Rambouillet">
<text>The Hôtel de Rambouillet (), formerly the Hôtel de Pisani (), was the Paris residence of Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet, who ran a renowned literary salon there from 1620 until 1648. It was situated on the west side of the rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre, just north of Marie de Rohan&#x27;s Hôtel de Chevreuse, in a former quarter of Paris (demolished during the 19th century), located between the Louvre and Tuileries palaces, near the then much smaller Place du Carrousel, in the area of what was to become the Pavillon Turgot of the Louvre Museum. 

== Salon ==
Members of her salon, received in the intimacy of her &quot;Chambre Bleue&quot;, admitted to the &quot;ruelle&quot;—the space between her daybed and the wall of the alcove— represented the flower of contemporary French literature, fashion, and wit, including Madame de Sévigné, Madame de La Fayette, Mademoiselle de Scudéry, the Duchesse de Longueville, the Duchesse de Montpensier, Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac, Bossuet, Jean Chapelain, Corneille, François de Malherbe, Racan, Richelieu, La Rochefoucauld, Paul Scarron, Claude Favre de Vaugelas, and Vincent Voiture. They adopted for themselves the term &quot;précieux&quot;, which became a term of abuse when satirized by Molière in &quot;Les Précieuses ridicules&quot; (1659). 

The quality looked for in this self-defining circle was &quot;honnêteté&quot;, a quality looked for in vain at the contemporary court, crass, ostentatious, corrupt and corrupting. &quot;Honnêteté&quot; was a mode of restraint and decorum, so practiced that it had become easy and as if natural, shared by aristocrats and fastidious members of the high bourgeoisie, but which could not readily be taught or learned. In contrast with the court, the &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot; received an elite that chose its own members, or, more precisely, whose members recognized one another&#x27;s right to belong... The ordinary rules of civility did not govern daily interchange. Members of the group wrote and above all talked to one another. Conversation was a sacred art, the forum in which the group developed its taste. &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot; was staged as well as read; other reading included the novels of La Calprenède and Mlle de Scudéry, which held up a mirror of this microsociety&quot;.

The &quot;préciosité&quot; refinements of the French language would find some codification in the &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; eventually published by the Académie française, which found its start in the &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot;. Words like &quot;celadon&quot; to describe a certain range of pale glaucous blue-green glazes of Chinese porcelain come straight from the &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot;.

<text>Garching bei München (, &quot;Garching near Munich&quot;) or Garching is a city in Bavaria, near Munich. It is the home of several research institutes and university departments, located at Campus Garching.

==History==
===Spatial urban planning=== 

Garching was small Bavarian village, until the Free State of Bavaria decided to implement a technology and urban planning policy whereby science should be clustered north of Munich. This urban planning policy was in line with the principles advanced by the International Congress of Modernist Architects (CIAM) in the 1933 Athens Charter. Garching was redeveloped in three spatially separated parts, to cover the urban functions of industry, habitation, and research. In 1959 a new residential quarter for Max Planck Society employees was constructed. In 1960 the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics was established in Garching. 

In 1963 Technical University of Munich (TUM) published plans, whereby some TUM institutes would be moved to Garching. The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics and the Institute for Radiochemistry were both established in Garching in 1964. In 1966 the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities established the Walther Meißner Institute for Low Temperature Research in Garching. In 1967 the TUM and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) established a joint accelerator laboratory in Garching. In the same year the TUM moved its department of chemistry and its department of biology to Garching. The industry zone of Garching was built up in Garching-Hochbruck. However, Garching only promoted itself as science city, by incorporating the local nuclear reactor, affectionately known as &quot;atomic egg&quot;, in the official coat of arms in 1967.

After World War II the scientific publishing business started off slowly and had to be relaunched. A photojournalist lamented, that &quot;photographers would rather go visit the kampas, the dangerous natives on the banks of the Ucayali River, than Professor Heisenberg in the Max Planck Institute.&quot;

==Districts==
The town has four districts:
* Garching city
* Garching Hochbrück
* Campus Garching (University and Research Campus)
* Dirnismaning

==High-tech hub==
Garching is part of the Nordallianz, a group of 8 towns and cities situated north of Munich.

==Transport==
The town is at , near the river Isar and the Bundesautobahn 9.

The Munich U-Bahn line U6 connects the city with the stations Garching-Hochbrück, Garching and Garching-Forschungszentrum (&quot;Garching Science Campus&quot;).

<text>Néstor Isaías Chávez Silva (July 6, 1947 - March 16, 1969) was a Venezuelan right-handed starting pitcher who played in Major League Baseball for the San Francisco Giants in 1967. Chávez was just 21 when he was killed in one of the worst aircraft tragedies in Venezuelan history.

==Career==
Chávez was born on July 6, 1947, in Chacao, Miranda State, Venezuela. He was signed as an amateur free agent in 1964 after producing a 34–3 record at the college. Chávez was nicknamed &quot;Látigo&quot; (whip) in his homeland, both for his stunning and sharp fastball.

Listed at , , Chávez was one of the best pitching prospects in the Giants farm system. At 19, he was called up to the big club after a combined 47–20 mark in the minors. In two games with the Giants, he compiled a 1–0 record with three strike outs and a 0.00 ERA in five innings. After the season, he had shoulder surgery and was sidelined for more than a year.

Chávez was ready to start his rehabilitation in the minors in 1969. However, on March 16 of that year, Chávez died in Maracaibo, in one of the worst aircraft tragedies in Venezuelan history, after Viasa Flight 742 crashed while taking off, killing all 84 aboard and 71 on the ground including Chávez. He was 21 years old.

<doc id="642383" wikidata="Q899334" url="?curid=642383" title="The Tin Drum">
<text>The Tin Drum (, ) is a 1959 novel by Günter Grass, the first book of his Danzig Trilogy. It was adapted into a 1979 film, which won both the 1979 Palme d&#x27;Or and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1980.

To &quot;beat a tin drum&quot; means to create a disturbance in order to bring attention to a cause.

==Plot==
The story revolves around the life of Oskar Matzerath, as narrated by himself when confined in a mental hospital during the years 1952–1954. Born in 1924 in the Free City of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), with an adult&#x27;s capacity for thought and perception, he decides never to grow up when he hears his father declare that he would become a grocer. Gifted with a piercing shriek that can shatter glass or be used as a weapon, Oskar declares himself to be one of those &quot;clairaudient infants&quot;, whose &quot;spiritual development is complete at birth and only needs to affirm itself&quot;. He retains the stature of a child while living through the beginning of World War II, several love affairs, and the world of postwar Europe. Through all this, a toy tin drum, the first of which he received as a present on his third birthday, followed by many replacement drums each time he wears one out from over-vigorous drumming, remains his treasured possession; he is willing to commit violence to retain it.

Oskar considers himself to have two &quot;presumptive fathers&quot;—his mother&#x27;s husband Alfred Matzerath, a member of the Nazi Party, and her cousin and lover Jan Bronski, a Danzig Pole who is executed for defending the Polish Post Office in Danzig during the German invasion of Poland. Oskar&#x27;s mother having died, Alfred marries Maria, a woman who is secretly Oskar&#x27;s first mistress. After marrying Alfred, Maria gives birth to Kurt, whom Oskar thereafter refers to as his son. But Oskar is disappointed to find that the baby persists in growing up, and will not join him in ceasing to grow at the age of three.

During the war, Oskar joins a troupe of performing dwarfs who entertain the German troops at the front line. But when his second love, the diminutive Roswitha, is killed by Allied troops in the invasion of Normandy, Oskar returns to his family in Danzig where he becomes the leader of a criminal youth gang (akin to the Edelweiss Pirates). The Red Army soon captures Danzig, and Alfred is shot by invading troops after he goes into seizures while swallowing his party pin to avoid being revealed as a Nazi. Oskar bears some culpability for both of his presumptive fathers&#x27; deaths since he leads Jan Bronski to the Polish Post Office in an effort to get his drum repaired and he returns Alfred Matzerath&#x27;s Nazi party pin while he is being interrogated by Soviet soldiers.

After the war Oskar, his widowed stepmother, and their son have to leave the now Polish city of Danzig and move to Düsseldorf, where he models in the nude and works engraving tombstones. Mounting tensions compel Oskar to live apart from Maria and Kurt; he decides on a flat owned by the Zeidlers. Upon moving in, he falls in love with Sister Dorothea, a neighbour, but he later fails to seduce her. During an encounter with fellow musician Klepp, Klepp asks Oskar how he has an authority over the judgement of music. Oskar, willing to prove himself once and for all, picks up his drum and sticks despite his vow to never play again after Alfred&#x27;s death, and plays a measure on his drum. The ensuing events lead Klepp, Oskar, and Scholle, a guitarist, to form the Rhine River Three jazz band. They are discovered by Mr. Schmuh, who invites them to play at the Onion Cellar club. After a virtuoso performance, a record company talent seeker discovers Oskar the jazz drummer and offers a contract. Oskar soon achieves fame and riches. One day while walking through a field he finds a severed finger: the ring finger of Sister Dorothea, who has been murdered. He then meets and befriends Vittlar. Oskar allows himself to be falsely convicted of the murder and is confined to an insane asylum, where he writes his memoirs.

==Characters==
The novel is divided into three books. The main characters in each book are:

=== Book One ===
* Oskar Matzerath: Writes his memoirs from 1952 to 1954, age 28 to 30, appearing as a zeitgeist throughout historic milestones. He is the novel&#x27;s main protagonist and unreliable narrator.
* Bruno Munsterberg: Oskar&#x27;s keeper, who watches him through a peep hole. He makes knot sculptures inspired by Oskar&#x27;s stories.
* Anna Koljaiczek Bronski: Oskar&#x27;s grandmother, conceives Oscar&#x27;s mother in 1899, which is when his memoir begins.
* Joseph Koljaiczek (&quot;Bang Bang Jop&quot; or &quot;Joe Colchic&quot;): Oskar&#x27;s grandfather, a &quot;firebug&quot;.
* Agnes Koljaiczek: Kashubian Oskar&#x27;s mother.
* Jan Bronski: Agnes&#x27;s cousin and lover. Oskar&#x27;s presumptive father. Politically sided with the Poles.
* Alfred Matzerath: Agnes&#x27;s husband. Oskar&#x27;s other presumptive father. Politically sided with the Nazi Party.
* Sigismund Markus: A Jewish businessman in Danzig who owns the toy store where Oskar gets his tin drums. The store is ruined during the Danzig Kristallnacht.

=== Book Two ===
* Maria Truczinski: Girl hired by Alfred to help run his store after Agnes dies and with whom Oskar has his first sexual experience. She becomes pregnant and marries Alfred, but both Alfred and Oskar believe that they are Maria&#x27;s child&#x27;s father. She remains Oskar&#x27;s family throughout the post-war years.

==Style==
Oskar Matzerath is an unreliable narrator, as his sanity, or insanity, never becomes clear. He tells the tale in first person, though he occasionally diverts to third person, sometimes within the same sentence. As an unreliable narrator, he may contradict himself within his autobiography, as with his varying accounts of, but not exclusively, the Defense of the Polish Post Office, his grandfather Koljaiczek&#x27;s fate, his paternal status over Kurt, Maria&#x27;s son, and many others.

The novel is strongly political in nature, although it goes beyond a political novel in the writing&#x27;s stylistic plurality. There are elements of allegory, myth and legend, placing it in the genre of magic realism.

&quot;The Tin Drum&quot; has religious overtones, both Jewish and Christian. Oskar holds conversations with both Jesus and Satan throughout the book. His gang members call him &quot;Jesus&quot;, and he refers to himself as &quot;Satan&quot; later in the book.

==Critical reception==
Initial reaction to &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; was mixed. It was called blasphemous and pornographic by some, and legal action was taken against it and Grass. However, by 1965 sentiment had cemented into public acceptance, and it soon became recognized as a classic of post-World War II literature, both in Germany and around the world.

==Translations==
A translation into English by Ralph Manheim was published in 1961. A new 50th anniversary translation into English by Breon Mitchell was published in 2009.

==Adaptations==

===Film===

In 1979 a film adaptation appeared by Volker Schlöndorff. It covers only Books One and Two, concluding at the end of the war. It shared the 1979 Cannes Film Festival Palme d&#x27;Or with &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. It also won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of 1979 at the 1980 Academy Awards.

===Radio===
In 1996 a radio dramatisation starring Phil Daniels was broadcast by BBC Radio 4. Adapted by Mike Walker, it won the British Writers Guild award for best dramatisation.

===Theatre===
The Kneehigh Theatre company performed an adaption of the novel in 2017 at the Everyman Theatre located in Liverpool. The production features the story from Oskar&#x27;s birth through the war, ending with Oskar marrying Maria.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Onion Cellar&quot;, a play by Amanda Palmer and Brian Viglione of The Dresden Dolls with the American Repertory Theater, is based on a chapter in &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;.
*&quot;Return to the Onion Cellar: A Dark Rock Musical&quot;, an original musical premiered in 2010 at the New York International Fringe Festival, references &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; and Günter Grass.
* The futurist band Japan named their final studio album &quot;Tin Drum&quot;.
*The tin drum is featured in Season 2 of the Starz TV series &quot;Counterpart&quot;. Emily Silk is seen carrying it around as she attempts to recover her memory following an attempted assassination.
*In the series finale of &quot;Key and Peele&quot;, &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; is listed as one of the movies that Ray Parker Jr. wrote a song for on his greatest hits album.
*The Tin Drum is a book in the home bookcase in the film &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;.

<text>An adapter or adaptor is a device that converts attributes of one electrical device or system to those of an otherwise incompatible device or system. Some modify power or signal attributes, while others merely adapt the physical form of one connector to another.

==Travel adapters==
Many countries with ties to Europe use 230-volt, 50 Hz AC mains electricity, using a variety of power plugs and sockets. Difficulty arises when moving an electrical device between countries that use different sockets. A passive electric power adapter, sometimes called a &quot;travel plug&quot; or &quot;travel adapter&quot;, allows using a plug from one region with a foreign socket. As other countries supply 120-volt, 60 Hz AC, using a travel adapter in a country with a different supply poses a safety hazard if the connected device does not support both input voltages.

==AC-to-DC adapters==

An AC-to-DC power supply adapts electricity from household mains voltage (either 120 or 230 volts AC) to low-voltage DC suitable for powering consumer electronics. Small, detached power supplies for consumer electronics are called &quot;AC adapters&quot;, or variously &quot;power bricks&quot;, &quot;wall warts&quot;, or &quot;chargers&quot;.

==Computer adapters==

A &quot;host controller&quot; connects a computer to a peripheral device, such as a storage device, network, or human interface device. As a host controller can also be viewed as bridging the protocols used on the buses between peripheral and computer, and internally to the computer, it is also called a &quot;host bus adapter&quot;. Likewise, specific types may be called adapters: a network interface controller may be called a &quot;network adapter&quot;, and a graphics card a &quot;display adapter&quot;.

Adapters (sometimes called &quot;dongles&quot;) allow connecting a peripheral device with one plug to a different jack on the computer. They are often used to connect modern devices to a legacy port on an old system, or legacy devices to a modern port. Such adapters may be entirely passive, or contain active circuitry.

A common type is a USB adapter.

One kind of serial port adapter enables connections between 25-contact and nine-contact connectors, but does not affect electrical power- and signalling-related attributes.

==Software adapters==
In software, an adapter is a piece of code that complies with an interface of an existing component while actually using another implementation.

<doc id="642390" wikidata="Q2240474" url="?curid=642390" title="Norse clans">
<text>The Scandinavian clan or ætt/ätt (pronounced in Old Norse) was a social group based on common descent, equivalent to a clan.

==History==
In the absence of a police force, the clan was the primary force of security in Norse society, as the clansmen were obliged by honour to avenge one another. The Norse clan was not tied to a certain territory in the same way as a Scottish clan, where the chief owned the territory. The land of the Scandinavian clan was owned by the individuals who had close neighbours from other clans. The name of the clan was derived from its ancestor, often with the addition of an -ung or -ing ending. The original meaning of &quot;ætt/ätt&quot; seems to have simply been &quot;those who are related&quot;. A person could technically belong to several clans, but usually the identification of an individual came with ancestry of most prestige. Therefore, through mostly the exception to the rule, a clan could have matrilineal name if the descent of the ancestral mother was considered more important than the father. Family names were not in use, instead patronyms and matronyms were used, likewise depending on the favoured ancestry. Therefore, the clan names reflected the common descent of family groups.

The heavy dependence on family and kindred in early Scandinavian history was the foundation of the importance clan. The Thing served as a moderating force which could prevent blood feuds between the clans due to the importance of kinship. As central government gradually was established in Scandinavia, the &quot;ætt&quot; lost its relevance for commoners. For royalty and nobility, however, it remained in use as the name for &quot;line&quot; and dynasty.

Examples of clans:
*Wægmunding, in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.
*Ylfing or &quot;Wulfing&quot; in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and Norse Sagas.
*Scylfing (Yngling)
*Skjöldung (Scylding)
*Völsung

<doc id="642391" wikidata="Q1152213" url="?curid=642391" title="Tony Tony Chopper">
<text>, otherwise known as &quot;Cotton Candy Lover&quot;, is a fictional character in the manga series &quot;One Piece&quot; created by Eiichiro Oda. He is the sixth member to join and the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. Chopper is frequently featured on official merchandise, serving as a mascot for the series.

The power of the Zoan-type provides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid. A drug he calls enables him to perform even more transformations for a short time.

Rejected by his herd because of his blue nose and eating the Devil Fruit, Chopper is rescued by Drum Island&#x27;s quack doctor Doctor Hiriluk. While developing a potion to create cherry blossoms when in contact with snow, Chopper is heartbroken when Hiriluk falls ill with a deadly disease. After Hiriluk&#x27;s death, Doctor Kureha takes him in as his mentor. After the Straw Hats arrive at Drum Island and take Chopper with them, Kureha uses Hiriluk&#x27;s potion to turn the snowy sky into cherry blossoms, fulfilling Hiriluk&#x27;s life mission. When complimented, Chopper acts flustered and sometimes yells at the person who complimented him to stop trying to make him happy. A running gag within the series is when other characters mistake him as a &quot;Tanuki&quot;, and he angrily corrects them, pointing out that he is a &quot;Tonakai&quot; (Japanese for &quot;Reindeer&quot;).

==About==

===Personality and Characteristics===

With Chopper&#x27;s back story, Oda wanted to illustrate that one need not be blood-related to be considered family. When asked by a fan what the nationalities of the members of the Straw Hat Pirates would be if &quot;One Piece&quot; was set in the real world, Oda replied that Chopper would be Canadian.

Chopper is initially ostracized as a monster. Chopper is very naïve, and has a tendency to believe anything told to him, even the outrageously fictitious, exaggerated lies of Usopp. Chopper loves to be complimented and is incapable of hiding his feelings. After the time-skip he embraces his status because he wants to be a &quot;monster for Luffy.&quot;

===Abilities===
The power of the Zoan-type provides Tony Tony Chopper with the ability to transform into three forms: a human (Currently never shown), human-reindeer hybrid or his default reindeer form. In addition to his normal transformations, Chopper developed a drug he calls the , having the shape of round yellow pills, which allows him four additional transformations to use temporarily. Although the primary effects of the rumble ball only last three minutes, Chopper cannot consume a second ball for six hours without adverse effects, mainly the loss of control over his transformations during the three minutes of his second Rumble Ball. If Chopper consumes three Rumble Balls within six hours, he grows to monstrous proportions and loses all self control and consciousness. This form, known as Monster Point, is extremely powerful, but also has the adverse effect of draining Chopper&#x27;s life force. After the two-year timeskip Chopper is able to transform into six forms without a rumble ball and can use a rumble ball to control his Monster Point. Later with the help of their enemy and temporary prisoner Caesar Clown, Chopper was able to improve the formula and lengthen the effects of the Rumble Ball ten-fold to thirty minutes at a time, albeit with new side-effects of Chopper temporarily shrinking down to an infant-like form, known as Baby Geezer, with antiqued speech.

Since Chopper is an animal who ate the Human-Human Fruit, he can converse with other animals and humans alike.

===Voice actress===

In the original Japanese anime of &quot;One Piece&quot;, Tony Tony Chopper&#x27;s main voice actress is Ikue Ōtani. Kazue Ikura voiced Tony Tony Chopper for episodes 254–263. Brina Palencia voices Chopper in the English Funimation dub. Lisa Ortiz voiced him in the 4Kids Entertainment English dub. Emlyn Morinelli voices Chopper in Singapore&#x27;s Odex dub.

== Appearances ==
=== In &quot;One Piece&quot; === 
Chopper grew up on the winter island Drum, where he was an outcast among reindeer due to his blue nose. He ate the , giving him the ability to speak, think, and transform into a human. This ability further alienated him from the other reindeer, and he was rejected by the herd. He grew up an outcast until taken in by the fake doctor Hiriluk, a former thief, who accepts Chopper as his son to instills within him his initial passion for medicine. After Hiriluk&#x27;s death, Chopper becomes Dr. Kureha&#x27;s assistant and learns her medical knowledge.

Luffy tries &quot;to convince Chopper to join the crew as the ship&#x27;s Doctor&quot;. A frightened Chopper continues to give Luffy the slip and later explains he can&#x27;t be part of the crew because he is a monster. Luffy tells Chopper to shut up and come with them regardless, which moves Chopper to tears as he has finally found real friends, people who aren&#x27;t afraid of him.

Chopper is the doctor of the crew and has outstanding knowledge of medicine and medical drugs, as well as the preparation of remedies and ointments from regular fruits, roots and vegetables found on most islands. Most of this he learned during his apprenticeship under Dr. Kureha or from his time at the Birdie Kingdom.

Chopper stands at a height of 90 cm (2&#x27;11&quot;) and weighs 20 kg (44 lbs) in his Brain Point form. He possesses extraordinary genius-level intelligence, excelling in medicine, surgery, and pharmacology. His power ranking is classified as Class A, with attack potency ranging from Large Building to City Block level. His speed varies from Supersonic+ to Hypersonic+, and his lifting strength is rated between Class 5 and Class M. In battle, Chopper is an expert fighter who leverages his transformative abilities to gain advantages. He has enhanced stamina at an exceptional human level and durability comparable to City Block level. However, his primary weakness is that he becomes immobilized if more than half of his body is submerged in water.

Chopper found a genuine feeling of family after joining the Straw Hats, where his friends encourage him as a person and as a doctor. He treats injuries and illnesses and creates antidotes in emergency situations because of his medical knowledge and charming demeanor, which makes him a vital member of the crew. During the Punk Hazard arc, one of his greatest accomplishments was developing an antidote to protect youngsters Caesar Clown experimented on.

===In other media===
Chopper has appeared in other media besides the manga and its television anime adaptation. He is featured in most of the &quot;One Piece&quot; films starting with &quot;Movie 3: Chopper&#x27;s Kingdom of Strange Animal Island&quot;, where he is the main character. He is also the main character in the ninth movie, which is a retelling of the storyline during which he was introduced. He is also set to appear in the second season of the live-action adaptation of &quot;One Piece&quot;.

Chopper has appeared in many &quot;One Piece&quot; licensed electronic video games. Though in the game, &quot;One Piece: Grand Battle&quot; he is not labeled as a Straw Hat character, and has no alliance in the game. Though like the rest of the Straw Hat&#x27;s, he has unlockable costumes outside of his alternate colors. In &quot;One Piece: Grand Adventure&quot; he is aligned with the Straw Hats. He is also a support character in &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot;. In 2006, he is featured in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;/&quot;One Piece&quot;/&quot;Naruto&quot; crossover game &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N.&quot; as a playable character.

Chopper was seen in &quot;Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan&quot; when Sakura mentions &quot;reindeer who are doctors&quot; and other things from anime, while he was freaking out in a forest. He also appears twice in the Webcomic VG Cats. Chopper and other characters also appeared in &quot;Cross Epoch&quot;, a crossover between &quot;One Piece&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;.

===In merchandise===
There have been various pieces of merchandise released for Chopper over the years. Various plush figures have been based on him, including many season based ones, as well as an assortment of others. There have also been many figures released of Chopper. Additionally, there have been many other pieces of merchandise based on Chopper such as cushions, clothing, towels, key chains, and clocks.

== Reception ==
===Critical reception===
Sean Cubillas of Screen Rant ranked Chopper third on a top ten list of the most adorable anthropomorphic anime animals, writing, &quot;It makes sense that the best-selling manga of all time would also have one of the cutest, talking animal characters of all time. Though berated by humans as a monster and even as an outcast by other reindeer, Tony Tony Chopper hasn&#x27;t become anything less than a friendly, welcome face for all the fans. It also helps that there&#x27;s just a lot of One Piece merch centered around him.&quot; In a review, Cubillas writes &quot;Tony Tony Chopper on design alone is already plenty iconic. He&#x27;s meant to be the mascot for the series and after seeing all of the One Piece merch with his face on it, he&#x27;s done a pretty good job. The scene to define him, however, comes in his backstory. After tragically losing Dr. Hiluluk to a political assassination, his own poison mushroom soup, and an undisclosed terminal illness, Chopper runs to Dr. Kureha&#x27;s office waving Hiluluk&#x27;s pirate flag. He begs the old woman to teach him, proclaiming that he wants to be a doctor that can cure any disease.&quot;

In another article, Cubillas uniquely gave Chopper two entries in his ranking of the series top ten running gags, noting &quot;Part of the Cowardly Trio, Chopper is as up for a fight as Usopp with an actual illness. Unfortunately for him, he can&#x27;t quite hide away … it&#x27;s easy to understand why most characters who see him for the first time tend to think that he&#x27;s a tanuki (or a raccoon dog). While Chopper has some kinship with other animals, he certainly doesn&#x27;t like being mislabeled, particularly when this denotes him as the Straw Hat&#x27;s pet and not as the talented doctor that he truly is.&quot;

An IGN review of the manga praised Chopper&#x27;s character as one of the best in the series and said that he was able to be both touching and funny.

However, Chopper&#x27;s status as a mascot met with criticism by both fans and critics, who view him as too stereotypical and insufficiently developed compared to the other Straw Hats. Dyler Crews wrote, &quot;Even before Pikachu solidified the concept of a manga and anime franchise having an adorable mascot in the &#x27;90s, the trope was already old hat. Looking to cash in on merchandising, Oda simplified Tony Tony Chopper&#x27;s design to make the character resemble a plush toy. Although Oda didn&#x27;t relegate Chopper to mascot status only, giving the character an essential job within the crew, Chopper&#x27;s utility in the story has diminished as his marketability grew,Chopper is now often used for jokes or cute moments instead of playing a central role as the crew&#x27;s doctor in important storylines.Having the voice actor behind Pikachu didn&#x27;t help either.

===Popularity===
Chopper ranked in the top ten during the second through seventh popularity polls. Chopper was the fourth most popular character in the second, third, and fourth Japanese popularity polls. He was ranked the seventh most popular character in the fifth and sixth Japanese popularity poll. In the first worldwide popularity poll, Chopper was ranked the sixteenth most-favorite character.

The denouement of Chopper&#x27;s introduction arc was rated the ninth most heartbreaking scene in One Piece, and Chopper was involved in half of the top ten most heartbreaking scenes in the manga: the Going Merry&#x27;s funeral, Robin saying she wants to live, the Straw Hats&#x27; departure, the Going Merry rescuing the Straw Hats, and the aforementioned denouement, when Kureha fulfills Hiriluk&#x27;s dying wish by making Drum &quot;bloom&quot; like a Sakura tree. Jamie Lee Curtis said Chopper was her favorite character and that she was interested in playing Kureha, Chopper&#x27;s mentor, in the live-action adaptation, although she ultimately did not play the character due to scheduling conflicts.

<doc id="642393" wikidata="Q6915003" url="?curid=642393" title="Mortuary house">
<text>In archaeology and anthropology a mortuary house is any purpose-built structure, often resembling a normal dwelling in many ways, in which a dead body is buried.

Proper treatment and placing of the dead has always been of great concern to people around the world. While choice of burial location and treatment of the corpse usually depend on beliefs and ritual standards within a specific cultural context, they are as well of a strategic nature. Burial decisions are affected by cultural norms regarding the deceased’s age, gender, vertical or horizontal status and by the relationship of people to places and other people. Ideas concerning proper burial also apply to those who have been defunct for quite some time. Dead bodies have been exhumed, reburied and desecrated in order to redefine – elevate or degrade – the status of their owners, construct new affiliations, rewrite history and to retrieve or construct social memory.

Following the laying to rest of the deceased, who is often surrounded with grave goods, an earthwork called a kurgan in Russian or barrow in English is raised over the house and the structure left sealed.

The term has parallels with Christian sepulchres which contain only one burial. Mortuary houses differ from mortuary enclosures in size, design and in the latter&#x27;s capacity for multiple burials.

==Origin==
According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word mortuary derived in the early 14th century, from the word mortuarie, an Anglo-French word meaning &quot;gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner&quot;; from a Medieval Latin word mortuarium, a noun use of neuterof Late Latin adjective mortuarius &quot;pertaining to the dead&quot;, from Latin mortuus, past participle of mori &quot;to die&quot;. The meaning &quot;place where bodies are kept temporarily&quot; was first recorded in 1865, a euphemism for earlier deadhouse.

== History ==
Philip Lieberman suggests that burial and mortuary housing may signify a &quot;concern for the dead that transcends daily life.&quot; It may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice. Mortuary housing rituals can be detected back to the earliest days of human existence. Evidence suggests that the Neanderthals were the first human species to practice burial behavior and intentionally bury their dead, doing so in shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones. The earliest undisputed human burial, discovered so far, dates back 100,000 years. Human skeletal remains stained with red ochre were discovered in the Skhul cave at Qafzeh, Israel.

Egyptian Pyramids

Ancient Egypt is well known in their unique housing of the dead. The complex construction of chambers were both alluring and mysterious. The tombs represented as mortuary temples for the dead and the afterlife.

==Case studies==
Ballyveelish, Co. Tipperary Ireland 

The outline of a timber building was discovered by an archaeologist. From the circle of post holes and foundation trenches, the house was determined to be 7m x 5.1m. This structure was classified as a mortuary house, instead of dwelling, because of a lack of evidence of a hearth.

It is believed the mortuary house was built to serve a ceremonial function associated with the interment of human remains. Using radiocarbon dating it was determined this site was erected in the Bronze Age.

<doc id="642394" wikidata="Q4574584" url="?curid=642394" title="Omega 7">
<text>Omega 7 was an anti-Castro Cuban group based in Florida and New York made up of Cuban exiles whose stated goal was to overthrow Fidel Castro. The group had fewer than 20 members. According to the Global Terrorism Database, Omega 7 was responsible for at least 55 known anti-Castro attacks over the span of eight years with a majority of them being bombs. The group also took part in multiple high-profile murders and assassination attempts and has committed four known murders. Among their assassinations was Felix Garcia Rodriguez, a Cuban delegate who was gunned down on the 6th anniversary of the group. The group had conspired to assassinate Fidel Castro during the Cuban leader&#x27;s visit to the United Nations in 1979.

==History==
Eduardo Arocena was born in Cuba on February 26, 1943, and was in school until the start of Castro&#x27;s regime in 1959. Arocena was a gifted amateur wrestler who had considered taking part in the Olympics. Arocena had been collaborating with other Cuban expatriates and exiles and taking part in activities against Castro that included the destruction of many crucial industrial and agricultural locations. 

Arocena eventually left to the United States out of fear of his anti-regime actions being exposed. While in the U.S. Arocena resided in New Jersey where he worked in a warehouse and started a family. 

Dissatisfied with the political opposition to Fidel Castro at the time, during the 1970s Arocena began to recruit Cuban veterans from the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961. In addition to this Arocena would go on to pull members in other anti-Castro exile groups as well, eventually forming his Omega 7 group on September 11, 1974. The New Jersey branch was made up of seven members (for which the group was named) including Arocena himself, Jose Juilio Garcia, Pedro Remon, Andres Garcia, Alberto Perez, Eduardo Ochoa, and Eduardo Losada-Fernandez. 

As the tactical commander of the group, Arocena has stated that the CIA trained him in 1967 in bomb making and a variety of other warfare skills and tactics, although the CIA has never directly confirmed this. Pedro Remon took part in most of Omega 7&#x27;s attacks and had the duty of calling local radio stations after each assassination or bombing. Most of the other members typically participated in more minor roles within the group. It is believed that the number of members in Omega 7 has never exceeded 20. 

The group was primarily funded by Cuban businessmen, but received additional funding in the early 1980s from marijuana drug traffickers. Although the group never took part in the selling or buying of narcotics, the group did perform collection tasks as well as other assignments given to them by the drug traffickers. One narcotics supplier in particular, known as Manuel Fernandez, would offer Arocena and the group large quantities of cash in exchange for their services. 

One of these tasks included an assassination attempt on Luis Fuentes a rival drug dealer to Fernandez. Fernandez eventually went on to testify against Arocena and Omega 7 claiming that they were paid up to $150,000 for their services despite never receiving his collection money from group, he also stated that he had sold two submachine guns to Omega 7. Eduardo Arocena was arrested in Miami on July 22, 1983, Omega 7 became inactive shortly after his arrest.

===Indictment of Eduardo Arocena===
On September 22, 1984, Eduardo Arocena was convicted on 26 charges which included murder and bombings, many of which Arocena confessed to prior to his conviction. Arocena was ruled to serve a mandatory life sentence. During Eduardo Arocena&#x27;s trial, he claimed to have been taken to the FBI offices in New York City where he accused the Bureau of drugging him to the point of unconsciousness to which he found needle marks in his arms when he awoke. According to Arocena, the FBI had tried to coerce him into speaking about a variety of terrorist groups and operations. This story has never been confirmed by the F.B.I. When Eduardo Arocena was put on trial he initially denied being the leader of Omega 7, claiming that he was simply &quot;obsessed with Communism&quot; and had worked alongside the C.I.A. in Cuba in order to look into communist activities in Cuba. Arocena also denied ever taking part in terrorist actives in the United States, but did state that he was trained in the use of explosives by the C.I.A. in Florida. Arocena also stated that he once traveled Cuba, and releasing &quot;germs&quot; in the environment in order to start a chemical war between Cuba and the United States. In 2008, Arocena&#x27;s wife Miriam led a campaign, which petitioned for the release of her husband. Miriam suggested that the life sentence her husband received was unwarranted given the nature and patriotic reasons of Eduardo Arocena&#x27;s actions. Arocena was released on June 25, 2021.

===Known attacks===
On February 1, 1975, the group bombed the Venezuelan consulate in New York City. Arocena confessed to putting a hit out on Eulalio Jose Negrin who had negotiated with Cuba about the release of political prisoners. Arocena did not approve of any diplomatic negotiations with Cuba and therefore ordered Remon to kill Negrin. Remon completed the hit by murdering Negrin with a submachine gun in front of Negrin&#x27;s teenage son.

On September 11, 1980, an attaché with the Cuban Permanent Mission to the United Nations, Felix Garcia Rodriguez, was fatally shot. He was driving back to the Cuban Mission along the Queens Boulevard service road near 58th Street in Queens, and was killed by a bullet fired from a parked car. Garcia was &quot;the first United Nations official to have been assassinated in New York City since the founding of the world organization&quot; in 1945. 

During the indictment of Eduardo Arocena, Omega 7 was found guilty of at least seven bombings in the Miami, Florida area.

<doc id="642396" wikidata="Q3501283" url="?curid=642396" title="Dextro-Transposition of the great arteries">
<text>-Transposition of the great arteries (d-Transposition of the great arteries, dextro-TGA, or d-TGA) is a potentially life-threatening birth defect in the large arteries of the heart. The primary arteries (the aorta and the pulmonary artery) are d.

It is called a cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD) because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen. In segmental analysis, this condition is described as with, or just ventriculoarterial discordance. d-TGA is often referred to simply as [[transposition of the great arteries]] (TGA); however, TGA is a more general term which may also refer to [[levo-transposition of the great arteries]] (l-TGA).Another term commonly used to refer to both d-TGA and l-TGA is [[transposition of the great vessels]] (TGV), although this term might have an even broader meaning than TGA.

ly, a baby with d-TGA experiences no symptoms as the lungs will not be used until after birth, and oxygen is provided by the mother via the placenta and umbilical cord; in order for the red blood to bypass the lungs in utero, the fetal heart has two shunts that begin to close when the newborn starts breathing; these are the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus. The foramen ovale is a hole in the atrial septum which allows blood from the right atrium to flow into the left atrium; after birth, the left atrium will be filled with blood returning from the lungs and the foramen ovale will close. The ductus arteriosus is a small, artery-like structure which allows blood to flow from the trunk of the pulmonary artery into the aorta; after birth, the blood in the pulmonary artery will flow into the lungs and the ductus arteriosus will close. Sometimes these shunts will fail to close after birth; these defects are called patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus, and either may occur independently, or in combination with one another, or with d-TGA or other heart and/or general defects.

==Symptoms and signs==

Due to the low oxygen saturation of the blood, cyanosis will appear in areas: around the mouth and lips, fingertips, and toes; these areas are furthest from the heart, and since the circulated blood is not fully oxygenated to begin with, very little oxygen reaches the peripheral arteries. A d-TGA baby will exhibit indrawing beneath the ribcage and &quot;comfortable tachypnea&quot; (rapid breathing); this is likely a homeostatic reflex of the autonomic nervous system in response to hypoxic hypoxia. The infant will be easily fatigued and may experience weakness, particularly during feeding or playing; this interruption to feeding combined with hypoxia can cause failure to thrive. If d-TGA is not diagnosed and corrected early on, the infant may eventually experience syncopic episodes and develop clubbing of the fingers and toes.

==Diagnosis==
d-TGA can sometimes be diagnosed in utero with an ultrasound after 18 weeks gestation. However, if it is not diagnosed in utero, cyanosis of the newborn (blue baby) should immediately indicate that there is a problem with the cardiovascular system. Normally, the lungs are examined first, then the heart is examined if there are no apparent problems with the lungs. These examinations are typically performed using ultrasound, known as an echocardiogram when performed on the heart. Chest x-rays and electrocardiograms may also be used in reaching or confirming a diagnosis; however, an x-ray may appear normal immediately following birth. If d-TGA is accompanied by both a VSD and pulmonary stenosis, a systolic murmur will be present.

On the rare occasion (when there is a large VSD with no significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction), initial symptoms may go unnoticed, resulting in the infant being discharged without treatment in the event of a hospital or birthing center birth, or a delay in bringing the infant for diagnosis in the event of a home birth. On these occasions, a layperson is likely not to recognize symptoms until the infant is experiencing moderate to serious congestive heart failure (CHF) as a result of the heart working harder in a attempt to increase oxygen flow to the body; this overworking of the heart muscle eventually leads to hypertrophy and may result in cardiac arrest if left untreated.

===Description===
In a normal heart, oxygen-depleted (&quot;blue&quot;) blood is pumped from the right side of the heart, through the pulmonary artery, to the lungs where it is oxygenated. The oxygen-rich (&quot;red&quot;) blood then returns to the left heart, via the pulmonary veins, and is pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body, including the heart muscle itself.

With d-TGA, deoxygenated blood from the right heart is pumped immediately through the aorta and circulated to the body and the heart itself, bypassing the lungs altogether, while the left heart pumps oxygenated blood continuously back into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. In effect, two separate &quot;circular&quot; (parallel) circulatory systems are created, rather than the &quot;figure 8&quot; (in series) circulation of a normal cardio-pulmonary system.

===Variations and similar defects===

====Arterial spatial relationships====
Differences in the shape of the atrial septum and/or ventricular outflow tracts affect the relative positions of the aorta and pulmonary artery. In the majority of d-TGA cases, the aorta is anterior and to the right of the pulmonary artery, but it can also be directly anterior or anterior and to the left. The aorta and pulmonary artery can also be side by side, with aorta on either side. This is a less common variant, and with this arrangement, an unusual coronary artery pattern is common. There are also some cases with aorta to the right and posterior to the pulmonary artery.

====Simple and complex d-TGA====
d-TGA is often accompanied by other heart defects, the most common type being shunts such as atrial septal defect (ASD) including patent foramen ovale (PFO), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Stenosis of valves or vessels may also be present.

When no other heart defects are present it is called &#x27;simple&#x27; d-TGA; when other defects are present it is called &#x27;complex&#x27; d-TGA.

Although it may seem counterintuitive, complex d-TGA presents better chance of survival and less developmental risks than simple d-TGA, as well as usually requiring fewer invasive palliative procedures. This is because the left-to-right and bidirectional shunting caused by the defects common to complex d-TGA allow a higher amount of oxygen-rich blood to enter the systemic circulation. However, complex d-TGA may cause a very slight increase to length and risk of the corrective surgery, as most or all other heart defects will normally be repaired at the same time, and the heart becomes &quot;irritated&quot; the more it is manipulated.

==Treatment==

Life-saving heart surgery is always required. If the diagnosis is made in a standard hospital or other clinical facility, the baby will be transferred to a children&#x27;s hospital, if such facilities are available, for specialized paediatric treatment and equipment.

The patient will require constant monitoring and care in an intensive care unit (ICU).

===Palliative===
Palliative treatment is normally administered prior to corrective surgery in order to reduce the symptoms of d-TGA (and any other complications), giving the newborn or infant a better chance of surviving the surgery. Treatment may include any combination of:

===Surgery===

====Minor====
* Cardiac catheterization
** Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy
** Balloon angioplasty
** Endovascular stenting
** Angiography

Cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure which provides a means of performing a number of other procedures.

A balloon atrial septostomy is performed with a balloon catheter, which is inserted into a patent foramen ovale (PFO), or atrial septal defect (ASD) and inflated to enlarge the opening in the atrial septum; this creates a shunt which allows a larger amount of oxygenated (&quot;red&quot;) blood to enter the systemic circulation.

Angioplasty also requires a balloon catheter, which is used to stretch open a stenotic vessel; this relieves restricted blood flow, which could otherwise lead to congestive heart failure (CHF).

An endovascular stent is sometimes placed in a stenotic vessel immediately following a balloon angioplasty to maintain the widened passage.

Angiography involves using the catheter to release a contrast medium into the chambers and/or vessels of the heart; this process facilitates examining the flow of blood through the chambers during an echocardiogram, or shows the vessels clearly on a chest x-ray, MRI, or CT scan - this is of particular importance, as the coronary arteries must be carefully examined and &quot;mapped out&quot; prior to the corrective surgery.

It is commonplace for any of these palliations to be performed on a d-TGA patient.

====Moderate====
* Left anterior thoracotomy
** Isolated pulmonary artery banding (PAB)
* Left lateral thoracotomy
** PAB (when coarctation or aortic arch repair also required)
* Right lateral thoracotomy
** Blalock-Hanlon atrial septectomy

Each of these procedures is performed through an incision between the ribs and visualized by echocardiogram; these are far less common than heart cath procedures.

Pulmonary artery banding is used in a small number of cases of d-TGA, usually when the corrective surgery needs to be delayed, to create an artificial stenosis in order to control pulmonary blood pressure; PAB involves placing a band around the pulmonary trunk, this band can then be quickly and easily adjusted when necessary.

An atrial septectomy is the surgical removal of the atrial septum; this is performed when a patent foramen ovale (PFO), or atrial septal defect (ASD) are not present and additional shunting is required to raise the oxygen saturation of the blood flowing eventually into the aorta.

====Major====
* Median sternotomy
** PAB (when intracardiac procedures also required)
** Concomitant atrial septectomy

In recent years, it is quite rare for palliative procedures to be done via median sternotomy. However, if a sternotomy is required for a different procedure, in most cases all procedures that are immediately required will be performed at the same time.

===Monitoring and maintenance===

* Nasogastric tube (NG tube or simply NG)
* Intubation, oxygen mask, or nasal cannula
* Intravenous drip (IV)
* Arterial line
* Central venous catheter
* Fingerprick
* Sphygmomanometer
* Pulse oximeter
* EKG

An NG tube is used to deliver nourishment, and occasionally medication, to the patient. Since the tube extends right into the stomach, it can also be used to monitor how well the patient is digesting their &quot;food&quot;. Paediatric units normally provide facilities and equipment for mothers of infant patients to pump their breastmilk, which can then be fed to the infant through the NG tube, and/or stored for later use.

Oxygen therapy is commonplace for hospitalized d-TGA patients. This may range from an oxygen mask resting on the bed nearby their head to intubation. In some cases, patients are intubated as a precaution; the machine can monitor breathing and supplement the patient as much or as little as they need.

IV&#x27;s are used to deliver medication, blood products, or other fluids to the patient. Arterial lines provide a constant monitor of blood pressure, as well as a method of obtaining samples for blood gas tests; central lines can also monitor blood pressure and provide blood samples, as well as provide a means to deliver medication and nourishment; fingerpricks (or heelpricks on small babies) are used to obtain blood samples for certain tests.

A sphygmomanometer may be used for intermittent blood pressure monitoring even if a patient is being otherwise monitored using a central or arterial line.

A pulse oximeter is attached to a finger or toe and provides constant or intermittent monitoring of the blood&#x27;s oxygen saturation level.

An EKG creates a visual readout of how well the heart rhythm is functioning.

===Medication===
* Prostaglandin (PGE)
* Antibiotics
* Diuretics
* Analgesics
* Cardiac glycosides
* Sedatives

When PGE is administered to a newborn, it prevents the ductus arteriosus from closing, therefore providing an additional shunt through which to provide the systemic circulation with a higher level of oxygen.

Antibiotics may be administered preventatively. However, due to the physical strain caused by uncorrected d-TGA, as well as the potential for introduction of bacteria via arterial and central lines, infection is not uncommon in pre-operative patients.

Diuretics aid in flushing excess fluid from the body, thereby easing strain on the heart.

Analgesics normally are not used pre-operatively, but they may be used in certain cases. They are occasionally used partially for their sedative effects.

Cardiac glycosides are used to maintain proper heart rhythm while increasing the strength of each contraction.

Sedatives may be used palliatively to prevent a young child from thrashing about or pulling out any of their lines.

===Corrective surgery===

====Nikaidoh====
Bex who introduced the possibility of aortic translocation in 1980. But Nikaidoh has put the procedure in practice in 1984. It results in an anatomical normal heart, even better than with an ASO, because also the cones are switched instead of only the arteries as with an ASO. The procedure is contra-indicated by certain coronary anomalies.

In 1984, Nikaidoh introduced a surgical approach for the management of TGA, VSD, and pulmonary stenosis (PS), which he called &quot;aortic translocation and biventricular outflow tract reconstruction&quot;. The repair consisted of harvesting the aortic root from the right ventricle, with or without the coronary arteries attached, and relieving the LVOTO by dividing the outlet septum and pulmonary valve annulus. The LVOT is then restored by posteriorly translocating the aortic root and closing the VSD. Finally, the right ventricular outflow tract is reconstructed with a pericardial patch. This is a technically challenging procedure, but results in a more &quot;normal&quot; anatomic repair. The main thing is the repositioning of the native aortic root over to the LV cavity, avoiding the creation of a long tortuous intraventricular tunnel. This technique appears to prevent the development of LVOTO, which is a frequent complication of the Rastelli repair. The addition of the Lecompte maneuver may prevent branch pulmonary artery stenosis that may occur secondary to compression of the PA by the posteriorly displaced, translocated aortic root. It creates a direct RV to PA anastomosis and avoiding the use of a conduit, which should decrease the incidence of RVOT reinterventions.

====Lecompte====
Since 1981 LeCompte has put his LeCompte manoeuvre in use. This is used with the REV (Réparation à l&#x27;Etage Ventriculaire). This surgery is like the Rastelli procedure, but with the use of the pulmonary artery without a conduit.

====Rastelli====
When an arterials switch operation (ASO) is not possible e.g. in case of LVOTO an option is the Rastelli procedure. The pulmonal artery is shifted with help of conduit to the right ventricle. It has been used since 1960s. It has a disadvantage that the conduit does not grow, so re-operation is necessary.

====Arterial switch====
The Jatene procedure surgery is the preferred, and most frequently used, method of correcting d-TGA. It is ideally performed on an infant between 8–14 days old.

The heart and vessels are accessed via median sternotomy, and a cardiopulmonary bypass machine is used; as this machine needs its &quot;circulation&quot; to be filled with blood, a child will require a blood transfusion for this surgery. The procedure involves both the aorta and pulmonary artery; the coronary arteries are then detached from the aorta and reattached to the aorta, before &quot;swapping&quot; the upper portion of the aorta and pulmonary artery to the opposite arterial root. Including the anaesthesia and immediate post operative recovery, this surgery takes an average of approximately six to eight hours to complete.

Some arterial switch recipients may present with post-operative pulmonary stenosis, which would then be repaired with angioplasty, pulmonary stenting via heart cath or median sternotomy, and/or xenograft.
====Atrial switch====
In some cases, it is not possible to perform an arterial switch, either because of late diagnosis, sepsis, or a contraindicative coronary artery pattern. In the case of sepsis or late diagnosis, a delayed Arterial Switch can sometimes be made possible by PAB, which may also require a concomitant construction of an aortic-to-pulmonary artery shunt.

When an arterial switch is impossible, an atrial switch will be attempted using either the Senning or Mustard procedure. Both methods involve creating a baffle to redirect red and blue blood flow to the appropriate artery. Since the late 1970s the Mustard procedure has been preferred.

===Post-operative===
Following corrective surgery, but prior to cessation of anaesthesia, two small incisions are made immediately below the sternotomy incision which provide exit points for chest tubes used to drain fluid from the thoracic cavity, with one tube placed at the front and another at the rear of the heart.

The patient returns to the ICU post-operatively for recovery, maintenance, and close observation; recovery time may vary, but tends to average approximately two weeks, after which the patient may be transferred to a Transitional Care Unit (TCU), and eventually to a cardiac ward.

Post-operative care is very similar to the palliative care received, with the exception that the patient no longer requires PGE or the surgical palliation procedures. Additionally, the patient is kept on a cooling blanket for a period of time to prevent fever, which could cause brain damage. The sternum is not closed immediately which allows extra space in the thoracic cavity, preventing excess pressure on the heart, which swells considerably following the surgery; the sternum and incision are closed after a few days, when swelling is sufficiently reduced.

===Follow-up===
The infant will continue to see a cardiologist on a regular basis. Although these appointments are required less frequently as time goes on, they will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual, and may increase in the event of complications or as the individual approaches middle age.

The cardiology exam may include an echocardiogram, EKG, and/or cardiac stress test in addition to consultation.

Additionally, some individuals may require ongoing medication therapy at home, which may include diuretics (such as furosemide or spironolactone), analgesics (such as paracetamol), cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin), anticoagulants (such as heparin or aspirin), or other medications. If the individual has undergone stenting, an anticoagulant will be a necessity to prevent build-up around the stent(s), as the body will perceive the foreign body as a wound and attempt to heal it.

Some patients who had alternate corrective surgery, such as the Mustard or Senning procedure, may have issues with SA and VA nodal transmissions in later life. Typical symptoms include palpitations and problems with low heart rates. This is commonly solved with a Pacemaker unit, providing scar tissue from the original operation does not block its functionality.

More recently, ACE inhibitors have been prescribed to patients in the hope of relieving stress on the heart.

==Prognosis==
With simple d-TGA, if the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are allowed to close naturally, the newborn will likely not survive long enough to receive corrective surgery. With complex d-TGA, the infant will fail to thrive and is unlikely to survive longer than a year if corrective surgery is not performed. In most cases, the patient&#x27;s condition will deteriorate to the point of inoperability if the defect is not corrected in the first year.

While the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are open after birth, some mixing of red and blue blood occurs allowing a small amount of oxygen to be delivered to the body; if ASD, VSD, PFO, and/or PDA are present, this will allow a higher amount of the red and blue blood to be mixed, therefore delivering more oxygen to the body, but can complicate and lengthen the corrective surgery and/or be symptomatic.

Modern repair procedures within the ideal timeframe and without additional complications have a very high success rate.

==Epidemiology==
Heart defects are the most common birth defect, occurring in approximately 1% of live births. 5–7% of these are dextro-transposition of the great arteries. Such defects appear to be more common in men than women. Approximately one million people worldwide are currently living with a CHD.Having a child with a CHD increases an individual&#x27;s chances of having another child with a CHD from 1% to 3%. Subsequent children born with a CHD increase that individual&#x27;s chances further.

<doc id="642409" wikidata="Q6914999" url="?curid=642409" title="Mortuary enclosure">
<text>A mortuary enclosure is a term given in archaeology and anthropology to an area, surrounded by a wood, stone or earthwork barrier, in which dead bodies are placed for excarnation and to await secondary and/or collective burial. There are some parallels with mortuary houses although the two are the products of different cultural practices and traditions regarding the treatment of the dead.

The mortuary enclosures of the British Neolithic were sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under long barrows. Evidence from mortuary sites in Britain suggests that in the Neolithic era bodies were often defleshed and disarticulated with specific bones such as skulls or thigh bones separated and relocated apart from the body. There is considerable academic debate on the reason for these practices.

<doc id="642413" wikidata="Q2698905" url="?curid=642413" title="Deep River (Hikaru Utada album)">
<text>Deep River is the fourth studio album by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada. It was released via Toshiba EMI on June 19, 2002. The title of the album, as well as its title track, was inspired by the novel &quot;Deep River&quot; by Shusaku Endo. Utada wrote and co-produced the majority of the record, and unlike her previous album &quot;Distance&quot; (2001), she worked primarily with Japanese collaborator Akira Miyake and her father Teruzane Utada. Musically, &quot;Deep River&quot; is widely noted by fans and critics as the transition state from Utada&#x27;s earlier style, R&amp;B, to ethereal pop.

Music critics praised &quot;Deep River&quot;&#x27;s production and Utada&#x27;s experimental approach to her sound. Because of its glowing critical reviews, &quot;Deep River&quot; and its content received numerous awards and accolades. Commercially, the album attained meteoric success. In Japan, it debuted at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart and was certified triple million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for selling over three million copies. The album is listed as the eighth highest-selling album in Japanese music history.

To promote the album, Utada released four singles: &quot;Final Distance,&quot; &quot;Traveling,&quot; &quot;Hikari&quot; and &quot;Sakura Drops / Letters.&quot; All four of them performed well in Japan, with the second single &quot;Traveling&quot; becoming the album&#x27;s most commercially successful track. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;Hikari&quot; and its English-language version &quot;Simple &amp; Clean&quot; served as the theme song for Square&#x27;s action role-playing video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (2002), and is her most well-known single in the West. Along with the four singles, the song &quot;Play Ball&quot; was used as a radio single to promote the album, and the album&#x27;s title track received a music video. To promote the album, Utada went on promotional tours throughout Japan, and a video collection titled &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Clip Collection Vol. 3&quot; was released, which included all of the album&#x27;s music videos.

==Background and content==
On March 28, 2001, Utada released &quot;Distance&quot;, her third studio album. It serves as the follow-up to her highly successful major-label debut &quot;First Love&quot; (1999). &quot;Distance&quot; was a critical and commercial success in her native Japan, with the highest first-week sales of all time at the time (before Adele&#x27;s &quot;25&quot;), and eventually becoming the fourth best-selling album in the country. It also spawned a conga line of million-selling singles in Japan, with the Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis produced &quot;Addicted to You&quot; becoming the most successful of the bunch.

After finishing the record&#x27;s promotional tour, Utada attended Columbia University, taking a leave of absence in January 2001. Also, on September 11 of the same year, the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred in New York City, but Utada&#x27;s staff reported that she was safe the next day. In January of the following year, she turned 19, and in February, she announced that she had signed an exclusive contract with the record label Island Def Jam in New York. During that time, Utada began working on a new album. The record&#x27;s production was temporarily halted when she was diagnosed with a benign ovarian tumour, which she successfully removed; she resumed work after recovering from surgery. Utada wrote and co-produced the majority of &quot;Deep River&quot;, but unlike &quot;Distance&quot;, she worked primarily with Japanese producers Akira Miyake and her father Teruzane. The album was produced in about a year, the shortest period of development for an album in her career. In an interview at the time, Utada said, &quot;Maybe it was because I felt that I had to make it in a hurry now. I thought it could only be done by me now. I know I&#x27;m changing rapidly, so...&quot;

Akira Miyake, who has been involved in the creation of Utada&#x27;s music since her debut, attributes the increased pace of songwriting to &quot;her budding professionalism.&quot; Utada also said that the album is full of her own &quot;color&quot; as she was fully involved in the arrangements. Utada stated that &quot;being unique is what I&#x27;m aiming for,&quot; but that she didn&#x27;t want to go so far as to be &quot;unrecognized by everyone.&quot; In a previous interview with Jun Kano, Kano had said, &quot;Rock isn&#x27;t about not needing anyone to understand,&quot; and when Radiohead released their album &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, Kano had said, &quot;Up until then, we&#x27;d made music that was easy to understand, and we valued our desire to connect with everyone&#x27;s ears and tastes.&quot; He felt a sense of empathy and relief when he heard these things. He also felt a sense of trust in his listeners, which allowed him to relax a little in his subsequent productions.

==Composition==

The musical compositions of &quot;Deep River&quot; is an evident departure from the templated Americanized R&amp;B sound of Utada&#x27;s blockbuster &quot;Distance&quot; album. The album is widely noted as the transition state from Utada&#x27;s earlier style, R&amp;B, to ethereal sounding pop music.

The album opener &quot;Sakura Drops&quot; is a mid-tempo ballad inspired by the oriental flavor of &quot;cherry blossoms&quot; and the gentle feeling of the season, and the arrangement by Utada herself is particularly noteworthy, blending psychedelic tones naturally with an exotic, sweeping melody. Utada also noted that the &quot;two-step, half-finished&quot; beat is a fine example of the intense emotional ups and downs of the song. The song &quot;Traveling,&quot; which Utada says was intended to be &quot;light and easy to understand&quot; and &quot;a cheerful song with a groove,&quot; is one of the most unique songs on the album, with its sophisticated house beat and caricature-like lyrics that also quote a famous passage from &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;. The lyrics are known for being difficult to understand, and Yosui Inoue finds &quot;the destructive impulse, nihilism, and momentary moments behind the humor&quot; in the lyrics.

&quot;Shiawase ni Narou&quot; features a western approach to R&amp;B music in its light tempo, with a simple and unrefined piano, and also quotes the melody of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Für Elise&quot; in the latter half of the song. It has also been pointed out that this is &quot;a quotation as a foreshadowing of tragedy&quot; since the background of the composition of &quot;Für Elise&quot; was &quot;a love affair with an aristocratic lady that could not be fulfilled.&quot; The album&#x27;s title track uses a sitar in both the intro and outro; the song was inspired by Shusaku Endo&#x27;s &quot;Deep River&quot;, which is about the Ganges River and indigenous beliefs in India. &quot;Letters&quot; features Latin-style rhythms and a melody that spirals upward. It is a &quot;hard-edged romantic&quot; song with a &quot;fierceness&quot; according to Utada, and it brings together Char, Yuji Toriyama, and Hisashi (from the rock band Glay), who Utada describes as &quot;hard-edged guitarists with a manly spirit.&quot; &quot;Play Ball&quot; is sung smoothly, comparing the emotions that oscillate between boldness and delicacy to playing baseball. It also features a slightly backward rhythm that emphasizes the third and fourth beats.

&quot;Tokyo Nights&quot; depicts a wanderer in search of a place where he can quench his thirst in the bustling nightless city of Tokyo, with arpeggios of oboe and harpsichord that seem to herald the arrival of night. &quot;A.S.A.P.&quot; contains the sampling of bells that continues from the intro and the beat, which is hastened by heavy, thick strings, creating a suspicious cloudiness. &quot;Uso Mitai na I Love You&quot; is a hard rock number with the same melody used in part in &quot;Simple &amp; Clean,&quot; the English adaptation of the song &quot;Hikari.&quot;

&quot;Final Distance&quot; is the song that inspired the creation of the album &quot;Deep River&quot;; Utada stated that the meaning of the word &quot;final&quot; for the song &quot;Final Distance&quot; is &quot;most important&quot; rather than &quot;last.&quot; &quot;Bridge - Interlude&quot; is a string-driven, one-minute instrumental. &quot;Hikari,&quot; which Utada chose to use her real name as the title, is neither a dance song nor a ballad, but a number with a new style that is different from her previous songs, featuring a deep acoustic guitar sound and a sparkling melody. Utada said that when she wrote the lyrics for this song, she dared to use styles and phrases that are not usually used in lyrics, and she also used the first person, &quot;&quot; and &quot;,&quot; which she had not used before, to give character to the main character of the lyrics.

==Title and artwork==

The title of the album, as well as the song &quot;Deep River,&quot; was inspired by the novel &quot;Deep River&quot; by Shusaku Endo. In May 2000, Utada revealed on her official website that she liked Endo&#x27;s &quot;The Sea and Poison&quot; and that she was in the process of reading &quot;Deep River&quot; again. The artwork for the album jacket and booklet was done by Kazuaki Kiriya, who also worked on the visuals of Utada&#x27;s previous album &quot;Distance&quot;. The entire album&#x27;s artwork is grayscale, and the booklet is infamous for including a photo of Utada&#x27;s foot.

Around the time of the album&#x27;s release, a large exhibition of Utada&#x27;s photographs taken by Daido Moriyama was held. The photographs were taken in the streets of Shinjuku. All of the photographs were in black and white and show Utada standing alone in a deserted urban alleyway. Utada and Moriyama have never met up with each other since then, and Moriyama recalled their encounter as a &quot;holy once-in-a-lifetime&quot; experience in a 2018 magazine interview. Moriyama said that his impression of Utada at the time was that she was &quot;a very smart girl, very honest and of good character,&quot; and that he had photographed Utada&#x27;s mother, Keiko Fuji, once before, which was one of the reasons he agreed to do the shoot. He also said that it was cute when Utada told him during the shoot, &quot;Please take beautiful pictures of me like my mother.&quot; Moriyama added, &quot;When I moved closer to get a close-up of Utada, she really looked like Keiko Fuji in the viewfinder. When I took the camera off, I saw Hikaru Utada, who still looked like a little girl. It was a strange feeling. I remember that feeling.&quot;

On July 25, 2001, Toshiba EMI released the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Final Distance.&quot; The physical version of the single contained both the original recording &quot;Distance&quot; and various remixes of the songs. The song received positive reviews from critics and peaked at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart. After shipping over 400,000 units, the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) certified it platinum. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Traveling,&quot; was released on November 28, 2001, along with an additional DVD that included the music video and behind-the-scenes footage. Critics praised the song&#x27;s danceable sound and production style.

On March 20, 2002, &quot;Hikari&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single. The song served as the theme song for Square&#x27;s action role-playing video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (2002), as well as its English version &quot;Simple &amp; Clean&quot; in international markets. It received positive reviews from critics and debuted at the top of the Oricon Singles Chart. The single was certified double platinum by the RIAJ after selling over 500,000 copies in Japan. &quot;Sakura Drops&quot; and &quot;Letters&quot; were released as a double A-side single on May 9, 2002.

The RIAJ certified &quot;Sakura Drops&quot; gold for exceeding 100,000 digital downloads. The song &quot;Play Ball&quot; was released as a radio single prior to the release of the album for promotion.

Owens-Corning Fiberglas Company was formed in 1935 through the merger of Owens-Illinois and Corning Glass Works. It became a separate company in 1938 with its headquarters established in Toledo, Ohio. In 1938, the company sales reached $2.6 million.

The company held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1952. In 1955, Owens-Corning purchased land for a research and testing facility near Granville, Ohio. Also in 1955, Owens-Corning made the first Fortune 500 company list. The company has been on the Fortune 500 list every year since its creation.

In 1965, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Europe was formed. In 1966, Owens-Corning established a partnership with Armstrong Rubber Co. to produce fiberglas-reinforced automobile tires. By 1971, Owens-Corning&#x27;s annual revenue was over $500 million. In 1974, the company opened a temporary plant to produce insulation for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. In 1977, Owens-Corning acquired Frye Roofing and began production of fiberglas mat to replace traditional paper mat used in roofing. Owens-Corning sales surpassed $1 billion in 1976, and sales were over $2 billion by 1979.

In 1980, Owens Corning entered into a long-standing agreement to use the Pink Panther as its brand mascot. &quot;He has become an important part of our brand,&quot; said Christian Nolte, director of strategic marketing for the manufacturer of building materials and fiberglass. &quot;The Pink Panther is as relevant today as he was 25 years ago. He brings our trademark color pink to life.&quot;

=== Asbestos controversy ===
In 1978, two shipyard workers filed a class action lawsuit against which alleged that Owens-Corning and 14 other manufacturers had known about asbestos-containing products. Over the next three decades, the company was named in hundreds of thousands of asbestos lawsuits. By 2000, it had settled with 440,000 people who claimed Owens Corning&#x27;s products caused them to develop asbestos-related illnesses such as mesothelioma.

=== 1981–present ===

In 1985, Owens-Corning acquired Aerospace and Strategic Metals Group in Newport Beach, California for $415 million from Armco Inc. The color PINK was trademarked through Owens-Corning in 1986, making it the first company to trademark a color. By 1990, Owens-Corning was the defendant in about 84,500 asbestos-related lawsuits.

The company opened an Asia/Pacific division in 1993. In May 1994, Owens-Corning acquired UC Industries, which produced Foamular polystyrene insulation, as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1996, the company changed its name to Owens Corning. In May 1997, Owens Corning acquired Fibreboard Corporation, a vinyl siding and other industrial material manufacturer, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Owens Corning. The company was ordered to pay $5 million to an asbestos victim in 1997, making it the highest jury verdict in the history of the United States for a single non-malignant asbestos case. In 1999, a jury in federal district court in Florida awarded $1.8 million compensatory damages and $31 million punitive damages against the company for asbestos products.

The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000. In 2002, Owens Corning removed its shares from the New York Stock Exchange. In 2006, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange again under ticker &quot;OC.&quot; In 2007, Owens Corning announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain named OCV Reinforcements.

Owens Corning partnered with DuPont in 2011 to create a steel and foam energy reduction (SAFER) barrier around auto racetracks. In July 2015, the company announced it would be moving a manufacturing center for mineral wool insulation into an empty plant west of Joplin, Missouri.

In May 2024 the company completed the acquisition of Masonite International, a provider of interior and exterior door systems, for $3.9B.

== Products ==
In 1939, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships made Owens-Corning insulation standard in new warship construction. Warship insulation, called Navy Board, was a permanent form-board insulation covered with woven continuous fiber cloth. Owens-Corning produced a prototype boat hull constructed of fiber glass-reinforced plastic in 1944.

In 1945, the company worked with an automaker to produce the first fiberglas-reinforced plastic car body. In 1953, General Motors used this type of body in the Chevrolet Corvette. In 1954, the company invented a process to make centrifugally-spun fiberglas wool, which became the standard process for producing fiberglas insulation.

In 1955, Owens-Corning introduced its Perma-Ply roofing material for built-up room insulation covering. The company created its first all fiber (AF) fiberglas wool in 1956. To distinguish its product, the company dyed their insulation pink by adding red dye to the AF wool. However, considering that the coloring made the insulation look pink, the company was concerned that the color would discourage the predominantly male-oriented market away from the material. As such, they decided to remove the coloring from their insulation, only to receive customer requests for the coloring to be restored. The company resumed the coloring in the face of such customer interest to the point of licensing the United Artists cartoon character the Pink Panther in 1979 as the product&#x27;s mascot. Furthermore, the company trademarked the coloring in 1987, the first time a color was used for that purpose.

After the January 27, 1967, Apollo 1 fire which killed three astronauts, NASA worked with Owens-Corning and DuPont to develop beta cloth, a fireproof cloth of woven fiberglas coated with Teflon, as a replacement for the nylon outer layer of the Apollo/Skylab A7L space suit.

In February 2017, Owens Corning received the Asthma and Allergy Friendly certification for its Pure Safety high-performance insulation. &quot;Owens Corning now joins a select group of manufacturers that are focused on product innovation to address people&#x27;s exposure to allergens and irritants in their homes,&quot; said Julian Francis, president of insulation, Owens Corning.

At the TCT Show in Birmingham, the XStrand family of materials was introduced. These composites are used for 3D printing.

== Plants ==
The company has 30 composites facilities, 31 insulation facilities, and 16 roofing facilities.

== Environmental work ==
In the Kansas City metropolitan area, Owens Corning purchases locally sourced recycled glass from Ripple Glass to manufacture fiberglas insulation in its local manufacturing plant. The joint effort between Owens Corning and Ripple Glass is helping to greatly reduce the amount of glass that would have been deposited in local Kansas City landfills. The Owens Corning Roofing and Asphalt Shingle Recycling Program was launched in 2009 to keep shingles out of landfills.

In 2013, Constellation Energy built a 2.7-megawatt solar power system at an Owens Corning insulation plant in Delmar, New York. The power system, which is leased to Owens Corning, can produce 3.3 million kilowatt hours of electrical energy in a year.

The National Safety Council awarded Owens Corning the Green Cross for Safety medal in 2014. Owens Corning received a perfect score of 100 percent on the 2015 Corporate Equality Index released by the Human Rights Campaign. Owens Corning has been recognized on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for six consecutive years as of 2015. It is also ranked number 1 in the 100 Best Corporate Citizens ranking by Corporate Responsibility Magazine in 2022.

<text>Sir Henry Edward Bunbury, 7th Baronet (4 March 1778 – 13 April 1860) was a British soldier and historian.

==Life==
Sir Henry, son of the famous caricaturist, Henry William Bunbury and Catherine Horneck, was educated at Westminster, and served on active service in the army from 1795 to 1809, notably in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799, the Egyptian Campaign 1801, and the campaigns in the Mediterranean, where Bunbury served as Quartermaster-General. He particularly distinguished himself at the Battle of Maida in 1806. He served as Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1809 to 1816. He was promoted to the rank of Major-General and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1815, and in the same year was responsible for informing Napoleon of his sentence of deportation to St Helena. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant-General.

Bunbury succeeded to the baronetcy in 1821 on the death of his uncle, Thomas Charles Bunbury. He was High Sheriff of Suffolk in 1825 and an active Member of Parliament for Suffolk from 1830 to 1832. He died at Barton Hall, Bury, Suffolk.

==Works==
Bunbury was the author of historical works, the most notable being his military memoirs &quot;Narratives of Some Passages in the Great War with France&quot;, first published in 1854.

&quot;Henry Bunbury&#x27;s &quot;Great War with France&quot; is perhaps the most valuable record... which any soldier has bequeathed to us of the long struggle that began in 1793 and ended in 1815. and it derives its value from the fact that the author was not only a good soldier, well skilled in his profession, but that he was, as a staff officer, thrown with the best British commanders... of his day; that he had opportunities of discussing with them every point of military policy and the details of many important campaigns; and that further he was a highly educated gentleman, with a seeing eye, a kindly nature, a keen sense of the ridiculous, and a very real literary gift.&quot;

==Family==
Bunbury married Louisa Amelia Fox, (daughter of General Henry Edward Fox and Marianne Clayton) on 4 April 1807. They had five children. He remarried Emily Napier (daughter of Lady Sarah Lennox and cousin of the same Henry Edward Fox) on 22 September 1830.

The eldest son, Sir Charles James Fox Bunbury inherited his title and was a well known naturalist. His second son, Sir Edward Herbert Bunbury, also a member of Parliament, was well known as a geographer and archaeologist, and author of a &quot;History of Ancient Geography&quot;. Another son Henry William St Pierre Bunbury was an explorer in Western Australia.

<doc id="642423" wikidata="Q358316" url="?curid=642423" title="Chamber tomb">
<text>A chamber tomb is a tomb for burial used in many different cultures. In the case of individual burials, the chamber is thought to signify a higher status for the interred than a simple grave. Built from rock or sometimes wood, the chambers could also serve as places for storage of the dead from one family or social group and were often used over long periods for multiple burials.

Most chamber tombs were constructed from large stones or megaliths and covered by cairns, barrows or earth. Some chamber tombs are rock-cut monuments or wooden-chambered tombs covered with earth barrows. Grave goods are a common characteristic of chamber tomb burials.

In Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe, stone-built examples of these burials are known by the generic term of megalithic tombs. Chamber tombs are often distinguished by the layout of their chambers and entrances or the shape and material of the structure that covered them, either an earth barrow or stone cairn. A wide variety of local types has been identified, and some designs appear to have influenced others.

<text>Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din (or Imam Yahya) (, 18 June 1869 – 17 February 1948) was the first king of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen from 1918 until his assassination in 1948. He became Imam of the Zaydis, a branch of Shia Islam, in 1904 after the death of his father, Muhammad Al-Mansur, and Imam of Yemen in 1918. His name and title in full was &quot;His Majesty &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;mimin al-Mutawakkil &#x27;Ala Allah Rab ul-Alamin Imam&quot; Yahya bin al-Mansur Bi&#x27;llah Muhammad Hamidaddin, Imam and Commander of the Faithful&quot; (the Prince of the Believers, He who Relies on God, the Lord of the Universe).

Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din was born on Friday 18 June 1869 in Sanaa into the Hamidaddin branch of the al-Qasimi dynasty who ruled most of Yemen proper and the southern region of present-day Saudi Arabia for over 900 years. When Yahya became Imam, he effectively ruled over the mountainous areas of what will be North Yemen. However, the Ottomans who made claims in the area did not recognize the rule of the Imams of Yemen since their entry into the region. He spent the early years of his reign attempting to expel the Ottoman presence, who withdrew only after their defeat in World War I.

A staunch isolationist, Imam Yahya never traveled outside of Yemen, and is said to have never left the Sanaa highlands or seen the Red Sea on his kingdom&#x27;s coast.

==Impressions==

Sir Gilbert Clayton, who visited King Yahya in Sana&#x27;a in an earnest attempt to win him over in 1925 and during his short stay in the capital, was impressed by this ruler&#x27;s administration, his military preparedness, and organization.

Lt Col. Harold Jacob, C.S.I. describing him said; &quot;Imam Yahya is a strong ruler. His sanctity as High Priest of the Zaidi sect and his descent from the Prophet&#x27;s family adds to the prestige which his benign rule has won. His methods are patriarchal and humane. His one hobby is the Yemen&quot;

Jewish chronicles lavish praise upon him and depict him as the champion of justice and compassion. Imam Yahia managed to put an end to the state of anarchy, lawlessness and violence which had lacerated the country and inflicted immense suffering upon its inhabitants, including the Jews. During his long reign the Jews enjoyed relatively favorable conditions and were generally in favour of the Imam. 
==World War I==
In 1911 Imam Yahya signed the Treaty of Daan with the Ottomans which recognised his rule over the Zaydi-controlled portions of Yemen.

News of the demise of the Ottoman Empire reached Yemen on Thursday 14 November 1918. Imam Yahya went to Sana&#x27;a three days later on Sunday 17 November 1918 to meet with tribal leaders from Hashid, Arhab, Nihm, and Khowlan. He arrived at the residence of the judge and scholar Hussein bin Ali Al Amri and received dignitaries, scholars, Turkish princes, judges, and a flood of subjects who proclaimed him the supreme ruler of all of Yemen.

His first order was to forbid entering the capital Sana&#x27;a with arms, and appointed sentries at the gates to start a reign of peace and justice unparalleled during the years of his rule. City after city accepted the rule and authority of Imam Yahya; the port of Mocha, and the city of Taiz were among the first most important cities. He took steps to create a modern state, and maintained all Ottoman officials who would stay to support the development of government.

He created a regular army in 1919 that enlisted soldiers from the surrounding tribes to Sana&#x27;a; from the tribes of Sanhan, Bani Harthi, and Bani Hushaish. He signed many treaties which recognised Yemen as a sovereign state, the first of which was the Italo-Yemeni Treaty in 1926.

Due to conflicting tribes in the border areas between Saudi Arabia and Yemen that escalated into a war ensued that was ended in 1934 with the signing of the Taif Treaty between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The treaty was the basis for the final territorial agreement between both countries concluded during the reign of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz and President Ali Abdullah Saleh.

==Internal policy==
From 1934 until his assassination in 1948, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, control of the hinterland was strengthened by the establishment of a standing army and the naming of his sons as governors of key provinces. Tighter control over affairs in Sana&#x27;a, the capital, was assured by expanding the scope of administrative functions and appointing other sons as supervisors of old and new political institutions. The regime sent Yemen&#x27;s first students abroad: military cadets to Iraq in the 1930s and civilian students, the &quot;Famous Forty,&quot; to Lebanon in the late 1940s. An early attempt was made to introduce some direction to the nascent national economy by the establishment of a Yemen trading company. Even with these changes, Yahya&#x27;s Yemen was a semi-feudal state in which even the most basic measures required his personal approval.

Imam Yahya was largely admired by the Jews of Yemen, who saw him as their patron and protector. Earlier, in 1906, the Jews of Sana&#x27;a had come out in full-force to welcome the Imam who returned to the city after the Turks had temporarily left it. However, by 1922, in response to outside pressure, Imam Yahya promulgated an edict that prohibited Yemeni Jewish emigration. Although the ban on emigration remained the official policy of the state until 1949, Jews were able to bypass its policy by secretly going into the British Protectorate of Aden. Throughout the early 1940s, Imam Yahya turned a blind eye to Jewish emigration, neither prohibiting it nor officially permitting it, but rather giving his unspoken consent to the departure of Jews from Sana&#x27;a and other central Yemeni settlements. During the Imam&#x27;s reign, he reinforced an old edict prohibiting Jews from building their houses higher than Muslim houses. The Imam appointed Yihya Yitzhak Halevi as one of four representatives of the Jewish community, responsible for conveying matters of state to his community and collecting the annual Poll-tax, a position which he held until his death. After the Imam&#x27;s assassination in 1948, the king&#x27;s emigration policy continued under his son Ahmad.

==Assassination==
During a short excursion outside of the periphery of Sana&#x27;a on 17 February 1948, the Imam&#x27;s limousine was ambushed by an assassin, during which the Imam Yahya and his grandson were shot and killed, in what became known as the al-Waziri coup. The assassin, known as Ali Nasser Al-Qardaei, was from the Murad tribe.

Upon the knowledge of the murder of Imam Yahya, Yemeni tribes rallied behind Sayf-ul-Islam Ahmad bin Yahya and accepted him as the new Imam of Yemen. The armies surrounded Sanaa under the leadership of Seif Ul Islam Alhassan and Seif Ul Islam Alabbass, both sons of the late Imam, supported by their brother Seif Ul Islam Yahya from within the city walls.

The news shocked both the Arab League, and all Muslim governments. King Abdullah of Jordan compared his death to that of the third Caliph Uthman.

Both King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, and himself supported Imam Ahmad, and were first to declare him as the new Head of State.

Yemen was a founding member of the Arab League in 1945, and later joined the United Nations in 1947.

In 1946 British opposition to Imam Yahya was led from Aden-based political parties.

He had 14 sons:

<text>William Cunnington FSA (1754 – 31 December 1810) was an English antiquarian and archaeologist.

== Archaeological investigations ==
Cunnington was a self-educated merchant, who developed an interest in the rich archaeological landscape around the Wiltshire village of Heytesbury where he lived and worked. In contrast to the vast majority of antiquarians of the time, Cunnington realised that to fully understand the barrows which fascinated him, they should be excavated and recorded carefully and methodically. Beginning his work around 1798, the initial investigations were self-funded, but increasingly they attracted the interest of a succession of wealthy patrons including H.P. Wyndham MP (whose sister Laetitia lived at Heytesbury House) and culminating in Sir Richard Colt Hoare (1758–1838) of Stourhead.

Hoare&#x27;s substantial financial investment in Cunnington&#x27;s work from 1804, and the consequent increase in the number of excavations undertaken, enabled the latter to excavate several hundred barrows across south Wiltshire. By modern standards, Cunnington&#x27;s excavation methodology – predominantly involving a shaft trench dug from the crown of a barrow to ground level in search of &quot;novelties&quot; – was poor, but he was the first archaeologist to undertake such an extensive campaign of work and was a true pioneer. It was not until the work of Thomas Bateman (1821–1861) in Derbyshire in the 1840s, that large scale excavations saw a significant step forward in methodology.

Stephen and John Parker, also of Heytesbury, worked on nearly all of Cunnington&#x27;s excavations up to 1810 and were held in some esteem as reliable, careful and experienced excavators. John Parker is more frequently discussed in correspondence between Cunnington and Hoare and it is clear that he was often despatched on travels across the Wiltshire Downs in search of new sites. John, born in 1780, is portrayed with some warmth by Cunnington and he comes across as hard-working and enthusiastic, being deeply disappointed by the failure of excavations to produce interesting material. 2009 research by Paul Everill has revealed the first reference to the use of a trowel on an archaeological site in a letter from Cunnington to Hoare in 1808, which describes John Parker using one in the excavation of Bush Barrow.

== Personal life ==
Cunnington was born at Grafton, Northamptonshire, in 1754, and by about 1775 he had settled as a tradesman at Heytesbury, Wiltshire.

He married Mary, daughter of Robert Meares, in 1787, and they had three daughters. One daughter, Elisabeth, married her cousin William Cunnington II; their son William Cunnington III (1813–1906) was instrumental in the formation of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society in 1853.

== Legacy ==
Along with Richard Colt Hoare, Cunnington was the subject of an exhibition at the Wiltshire Museum in 2003. The museum holds the archives made by Cunnington, along with watercolour drawings made by Philip Crocker and the objects that he excavated.

<text>MIAT Mongolian Airlines is the state-owned national airline of Mongolia, headquartered in the MIAT Building in the country&#x27;s capital of Ulaanbaatar. The airline operates scheduled services from its base at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Sergelen, near Ulaanbaatar.

== History ==

===Foundations===
The start of aviation in Mongolia is attributed to 25 May 1925, when a Junkers F 13 given by the USSR to the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic landed in Ulaanbaatar. In 1946, the Civil Air Transport Department () started operations with eight aircraft. It conducted direct flights from Ulaanbaatar to nearby provinces Selenge, Bulgan, Arkhangai, Övörkhangai, Khentii, Sükhbaatar, Dornod and performed limited charter and unscheduled airmail flights to the more isolated provinces.

=== Regular services ===
The first batch of Mongolian flight crew for Antonov An-2 operations were sent to Irkutsk for training in 1955, graduating the next year and paving the way for regular domestic services. Regular flights started on 7 July 1956 using an Antonov An-2 from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk. The Ilyushin Il-14 was introduced in 1957, and by 1958, MIAT had a fleet of 14 Antonov An-2 and seven Ilyushin Il-14 aircraft.

The first Antonov An-24 turboprop aircraft was received in 1964. An-26 twin turboprops were also obtained in the era.

By 1970, the airline was conducting services to 130 separate airfields in the country, with 4-6 flights a week from Ulaanbaatar to province centers (accounting for 70% of passengers), and 2-3 flights a week from province centers to sum centers.

In 1987 it started regular international operations to Moscow, Irkutsk, and Beijing (opening representative offices in the three cities) with its first jet aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154 on lease from Aeroflot.

=== Post-communist era ===
In 1992, MIAT bought five Chinese Harbin Y-12 commuter aircraft for domestic flights. The same year, the president of the Hanjin Group (parent of Korean Air) gave a Boeing 727-200 to the airline, with two more acquired in subsequent years. These three aircraft were used until 2003. In 1993, MIAT was made into an independent state-owned enterprise. 

International operations outside of the Soviet Union and China started in 1995 with regular flights to Seoul, followed by flights to Berlin and Osaka in 1996.

An Airbus A310 was leased in 1998, becoming MIAT&#x27;s first Airbus plane.

The 1990s were a spotty era in MIAT&#x27;s safety record, with four crashes of An-2, An-24, And Harbin Y-12 aircraft involving 139 fatalities. The last fatal crash was in 1998.

A Boeing 737 was leased in 2002 to replace the ageing 727-200 fleet, and the same year flights to Tokyo were introduced.

Between 2003 and 2008, MIAT&#x27;s An-24 and An-26 fleet was gradually retired. In April 2008, MIAT received its second Boeing 737-800 aircraft on lease from CIT Aerospace. In July 2008, MIAT ended scheduled domestic flights completely, briefly resuming scheduled domestic flights to Mörön and Khovd in June 2009.

In late 2009, MIAT flew charter flights to Hong Kong and Sanya, a popular resort city in Hainan, China. In June 2010, the airline&#x27;s flights were brought to a halt due to a mechanics&#x27; strike. However, the situation was resolved by replacing the CEO and Technical Director.

In early 2011, MIAT signed an agreement with Air Lease Corporation to lease two former China Eastern Airlines Boeing 767-300ERs until 2013. The first aircraft entered service in May 2011 with the second following in November 2011. In 2011 the Airbus A310 was retired after serving MIAT Mongolian Airlines for 13 years.

=== All-Boeing fleet ===
In June 2011, MIAT began regular flights to Hong Kong. The company also ordered three aircraft, a Boeing 767-300ER and two Boeing 737-800s, to be delivered in 2013 and 2016 respectively. The order marks the first time in two decades that MIAT has chosen to expand its fleet by purchasing new aircraft straight from the manufacturer rather than leasing them.

In January 2019, MIAT announced flights to Shanghai and Guangzhou in China to start in the summer of 2019. In addition, it announced the leasing of three Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to be delivered in January, May, and October 2019, thereby replacing two of its aircraft whose leases were due to expire in 2019, together with the implementation of a self-checking system.

In 2019, it was announced that MIAT had acquired a Boeing 787-9 on lease from Air Lease Corporation, to be delivered in 2021. This was disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a modified order of two Boeing 787-9s to be delivered starting in 2023, with flights being planned to Shanghai-Pudong, Ho Chi Minh, Singapore, and San Francisco.

=== Pandemic and post-pandemic ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic on 21 June 2020, MIAT performed the first non-stop flight (for repatriation and aid purposes) between Mongolia and North America in history with a Boeing 767-300 flown between Ulaanbaatar and Seattle. It performed similar repatriation and charter services during the pandemic to Sydney and Johannesburg, flying to the continents of Australia and Africa for the first time.

In October 2022, MIAT became the first carrier to fly a Boeing 737-MAX into China after the latter&#x27;s flight regulator grounded all 737 MAX aircraft in March 2019.

Starting June 2023, MIAT resumed its domestic operations, with flights to seven new destinations in Mongolia as well as restarting flights to Khovd and Mörön after 15 years. This was done in line with the government&#x27;s program of &#x27;2023-2025 – The Years to Visit Mongolia&#x27; to promote and support tourism in Mongolia. As part of this change, MIAT wet-leased a Bombardier CRJ-200 and Boeing 767 to increase capacity.

In August 2023 and April 2024, MIAT announced the arrival of two Boeing 787s, to be used to fly routes to Frankfurt, Istanbul, and Seoul initially.

In April 2024, MIAT received its first Bombardier CRJ700 for use in domestic routes in &quot;MIAT Regional&quot; Branding, increasing its domestic capacity.

== Destinations ==
As of October 2023, MIAT Mongolian Airlines served the following destinations.
MIAT Mongolian Airlines plans to transform Mongolia into a major air transit hub, leveraging its strategic geographical location between Europe and Asia. The airline aims to increase its transit passenger numbers significantly, targeting 24,000 passengers in 2024 and projects a revenue boost of 1 trillion MNT ($333 million). This initiative involves significant infrastructure upgrades at Chinggis Khaan International Airport, enhanced marketing strategies, and forming strategic partnerships to offer competitive pricing and high service standards, positioning Mongolia as a viable alternative to established transit hubs.

<doc id="642451" wikidata="Q691251" url="?curid=642451" title="Maximum Security (comics)">
<text>&quot;Maximum Security&quot; is a comic book story line and crossover event that ran through a three-issue self-titled limited series and individual issues of the other titles published by Marvel Comics with a cover date of either December 2000 or January 2001. In it, a multitude of alien civilizations that had previously interacted with Earth join forces to prevent humans from interfering further with galactic affairs. To accomplish this, they designate Earth as a penal colony.

The miniseries and its crossover in the pages of &quot;Avengers&quot; were written by Kurt Busiek.

Marvel collected much the story arc in trade paperback on November 24, 2010.

==Publication history==
In December 2000, Marvel Comics published &quot;Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet&quot;, which recapped relevant events and set up the crossover&#x27;s main plot. All three issues of &quot;Maximum Security&quot; were published in January 2001. Most other comics from the publisher that month tied into the event, if only marginally. Another tie-in comic, &quot;Maximum Security: Thor vs. Ego&quot; #1, reprinted earlier stories from &quot;Thor&quot;.

While not carrying the &quot;Maximum Security&quot; banner, plotlines from the earlier miniseries &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; (1999) and &quot;Avengers Infinity&quot; (2000) were concluded in &quot;Maximum Security&quot;.

Writer Kurt Busiek stated that he wrote the story out of &quot;self-defense&quot;, having been told that Marvel was looking for a big crossover story and that he either had to come up with one or he&#x27;d be participating in someone else&#x27;s.

His original synopsis was for a story called &quot;Y2KANG&quot; in which when the clock ticked over at midnight of New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999, it became 1900 again and all the Marvel characters would be turn-of-the-century versions of themselves. However, by the time Marvel stated this was the story they wanted to do, it couldn&#x27;t be solicited until April 2000 and wouldn&#x27;t have made any sense.

Busiek&#x27;s second suggestion was &quot;Maximum Security&quot;, the concept of which was influenced by Australian history and how the British used Australia as a place to dump convicts, too far away from Britain for them to escape and return. Busiek thought it would be fun if the galactic powers that be viewed Earth the same way, dumping their criminals here and not caring about what happened to the natives.

Busiek needed someone to play the &#x27;alien cop&#x27; and chose U.S. Agent, saying that he hadn&#x27;t been used much lately and was inspired by the character. He was influenced by Tommy Lee Jones&#x27; character from the movie &quot;The Fugitive&quot; because he was &quot;a tough, no nonsense Federal Agent who didn&#x27;t care about your sob stories, just that if you broke the law you were going to jail&quot;, considering the character&#x27;s personality to be &quot;very USAgent-y&quot;.

==Plot==
Thor, Tigra, Starfox, Quasar, Moondragon, Photon and Jack of Hearts become the temporary Avengers Infinity squad when they travel into space and encounter a group of cosmic entities called the Infinites. The Infinites have plans to rearrange galaxies (destroying all life in those galaxies in the process) in order to improve the flow of their energies. The heroes convince the Infinites not to destroy the Earth and the other threatened planets. At the end, the unofficial team began to make their way to an intergalactic bar.

Meanwhile, at the Intergalactic Council, the Skrull ambassador files a formal complaint against humans, charging that Professor X and a band of Skrull mutants known as Cadre K have been interfering in the extermination of other Skrull mutants. The council is attacked by Ego the Living Planet and are rescued by Professor X and Cadre K. A new race, the Ruul, helps to miniaturize and imprison Ego. Despite the human assistance, the council sides with the Skrulls and votes to take action against Earth.

Earth&#x27;s solar system is surrounded by a force field, and Earth is turned into a prison for intergalactic criminals, the Council reasoning that the criminals will keep Earth too occupied to do anything about the wider universe. Ronan the Accuser acts as warden from an orbiting space craft. The Avengers learn the miniaturized Ego is among the aliens condemned to Earth and that he is expanding and becoming one with the Earth. At the rate it grows, it could possibly assimilate the entire Earth within a week.

Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, and the Silver Surfer work to stop Ego from expanding. Meanwhile, Cadre K try to convince the Intergalactic Council to reverse its actions but are resisted by the Skrull ambassador. On Earth, people rally the alien criminals to fight back against Ronan.

Meanwhile, at a S.H.I.E.L.D. base on the moon, the Ruul release their leader, the Supreme Intelligence. At the same time, Cadre K is imprisoned as a result of their interruption of the council meeting.

While the Avengers Infinity group are held by the Shi&#x27;ar, the Ruul imprison them under the orders of the Supreme Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence tells them how he made use of the Destiny Crystal, a device of great power he recently acquired. He used the crystal to accelerate the evolution of the Kree, creating the Ruul, who then manipulated the Council in a plan to get revenge on and destroy the Avengers and Earth. He will then use Ego&#x27;s power as a weapon to expand the Kree empire.

U.S. Agent persuades the alien prisoners to fight on the side of Earth. He takes command of the Avengers and all the other heroes they can find and leads an attack on Ronan&#x27;s citadel. During the battle, the Avengers Infinity team free themselves and teleport to the Intergalactic Council. Moondragon telepathically explains the true situation to the Council. The Supreme Intelligence appears in front of the Council and admits the truth but claims that it is too late to stop it.

Using information obtained by Gambit, Quasar is able to absorb Ego into his Quantum Bands. Ronan is defeated, and the Supreme Intelligence&#x27;s plan fails. Quasar decides to leave Earth to avoid the risk of unleashing Ego again. The Council removes the alien criminals from Earth and decides to take no further action against humans for the time being.

<doc id="642456" wikidata="Q2363258" url="?curid=642456" title="Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet">
<text>Sir Richard Colt Hoare, 2nd Baronet (9 December 1758 – 19 May 1838) was an English antiquarian, archaeologist, artist, and traveller of the 18th and 19th centuries, the first major figure in the detailed study of the history of his home county of Wiltshire.

==Career and personal life==
Hoare was born in Barnes, Surrey, and was descended from Sir Richard Hoare, Lord Mayor of London, the founder of the family banking business, Hoare&#x27;s Bank. His parents were Sir Richard Hoare, 1st Baronet (1735–1787) and Anne Hoare (1737–1759). He was educated at preparatory school at Mr. Devis&#x27;s school, Wandsworth, and afterwards at Samuel Glasse&#x27;s school at Greenford, and was taught the Classics by the Rev. Joseph Eyre.

In 1783 Hoare married Hester, daughter of William Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton. In 1785 he inherited the large Stourhead estate in Wiltshire from his grandfather, Henry Hoare II, which enabled him to pursue his interests including the archaeological studies for which he had already shown an inclination. His inheritance came with the condition that he left the family&#x27;s banking business, since Henry Hoare II wished to ensure the survival of the estate if the family&#x27;s other business suffered eventual hardships. In 1785, Hoare&#x27;s wife died following the birth of their second child, who also died. Having lost his wife and previous career, he embarked on a continental tour to France, Italy and Switzerland. In 1786 he purchased Glastonbury Tor and funded the restoration of the church tower on it.

He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1787, and in 1788 made a second continental tour, the record of his travels appearing in 1815 and 1819 under the titles &quot;Recollections Abroad&quot; and &quot;A Classical Tour through Italy and Sicily&quot;. He took numerous views during his travels in the form of sketches from which he later produced mainly sepia wash drawings, along with a smaller number of watercolours. His tutor John &#x27;Warwick&#x27; Smith, and the painter Francis Nicholson, were also commissioned to produce coloured reductions from some of his continental sketches. Bound in volumes, many of these were dispersed in the Stourhead sales of the 1880s.
A journey through Wales was followed by a translation of the &quot;Itinerarium Cambriae&quot; and of the &quot;Descriptio Cambriae&quot; of Gerald of Wales, with Hoare adding notes and a life of Gerald to his translation. This work was first published in 1804, and was subsequently revised by Thomas Wright (1810–1877) in 1863. Hoare&#x27;s further &quot;Tour in Ireland&quot; was published in 1807.

Hoare was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1792 and was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1805. In 1825, Hoare donated his collection of Italian works on topography and history to the British Museum.

Sir Richard Colt Hoare was an avid plant collector and loved Pelargoniums and Rhododendrons.

== Death ==
He died at Stourhead in 1838. His mausoleum in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s in Stourton, the estate village, is under a pinnacled Gothic canopy designed by John Pinch the Elder.

== Contributions to archaeology ==
The first recorded excavations at Stonehenge were made by William Cunnington and Richard Colt Hoare in 1798 and again in 1810. They dug around a fallen trilithon and a fallen slaughter stone, and discovered that they had once stood up. Colt Hoare excavated 379 barrows on Salisbury Plain as well as identifying many other sites in the area, publishing and classifying his findings. However, as the three-age system had not yet been introduced he was unable to date his finds and was therefore at a disadvantage when trying to interpret them. His most important book, &quot;The Ancient History of Wiltshire&quot;, outlined his findings; this work was first published in five parts from 1810 to 1821 for binding in two volumes. He also sponsored and contributed significantly to the 11 volumes of &quot;The History of Modern Wiltshire&quot; (1822–1844).

<text>Bredon is a village and civil parish in Wychavon district at the southern edge of Worcestershire in England. It lies on the banks of the River Avon on the lower slopes of Bredon Hill.

==Location and geography==
Bredon is located north of the Gloucestershire town of Tewkesbury on the B4080 road. The River Avon forms the western boundary of the parish, and two of its tributaries, the Carrant Brook and Squitter Brook form the southern boundary.

The parish extends from the Avon valley floor at an elevation of in the south-west to the upper slopes of Bredon Hill at an elevation of in the north-east. The northern third of the parish falls within the Cotswolds AONB. At its greatest extent, the parish measures approximately long by wide and covers around .

==Population==
Bredon parish includes the hamlets of Bredon&#x27;s Hardwick, Kinsham and Westmancote. At the 2021 census the parish had a population of 2,705.

==History==

Bredon&#x27;s history of farming and settlement goes back at least four thousand years. Archaeological remains establish that parts of the parish were settled early in the Bronze Age (2500–800 BC). There are numerous Iron Age (800 BC–100 AD) remains, some of which would have related to Kemerton Camp, a large univallate hillfort at the summit of Bredon Hill. The parish is also rich in remains from the Britto-Roman Period (43–410 AD), revealing a continuing history of settlement and farming.

Modern Bredon has its roots in the Anglo-Saxon period (c.500–1066), when in c.716 Æthelbald, King of Mercia, gave land to his kinsman Eanwulf the grandfather of Offa to found a monastery. For some time, the manor of Bredon continued under an abbot of its own, but by 844 it had become the property of the Bishop of Worcester. It remained part of the Worcester monastic estate until the Reformation. Bredon&#x27;s name evolved during the Saxon period, deriving from bree (Celtic for hill) and don (Old English for hill).

From the Norman Conquest (1066) to the end of the Late Medieval Period (1500), the parish was governed under the feudal system. The manor was held by the Bishop of Worcester, who maintained a summer residence, park and fisheries on the site of the first monastery, and the medieval village developed around these church buildings. Following the Reformation in the 16th century, the manor passed to the Crown.

In 1718, wealthy resident William Hancock founded Bredon Hancock&#x27;s Endowed Church of England First School.
Bredon&#x27;s Act of Inclosure was passed in 1811, and among those gaining large consolidated holdings were the lord of the manor, Rev. Richard Darke, and the rector, Rev. John Keysall.

The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, one of the world&#x27;s oldest main line railways, was constructed during the 1830s and 1840s through the village, with Bredon railway station opening in 1841. This remained in operation until 1965, when it was closed under the Beeching Axe. The station is currently closed on the Cross Country Route.

In February 1971, a new section of the M5 motorway was opened, cutting through the parish to the west of the village.

==Buildings==
There are 43 listed buildings in the village, including St Giles&#x27;s Church and Bredon Barn (both Grade I), and the Old Rectory (Grade II*); the remainder are Grade II. A further 41 buildings were formerly listed prior to the abolition of the Grade III category in 1970. As is the case in most Cotswold villages, a variety of architectural styles and materials are in evidence, but almost all historic buildings are at least partly built from Cotswold limestone, quarried on Bredon Hill. Timber-frame construction was used as a secondary material up until the mid-17th century (often not painted black and white until the 20th century).

The earliest surviving building in the village, the parish church of St Giles, is one of England&#x27;s most admired churches. It is built largely in the Norman, Early English and Decorated styles. A substantial part of the nave, the north porch and the western tower arch date from the 12th century, with significant additions in the 13th and 14th centuries – the most visible being a tall, octagonal spire, dating from 1300 to 1350, made famous by the poet, John Masefield. A number of 14th century heraldic tiles are set in the sanctuary steps, showing the arms of England, France, Beauchamp of Powick, Beauchamp of Warwick, Mortimer, Berkeley and others. The church contains many interesting monuments, including several to members of the interrelated Reed, Copley and Parsons families.

To the west of the church is Bredon Barn, a late 14th century threshing barn (often incorrectly referred to as a tithe barn) measuring approximately 40 metres by 12 metres. It has an enormous steep pitched roof covered in Cotswold limestone tiles. Walls are of limestone rubble masonry, divided into nine bays by oak posts on stone plinths forming aisles and carrying the open timber roof. The barn was badly damaged by fire in 1980. Now restored, it is in the care of the National Trust.

==Natural history==
Bredon and its surroundings are exceptionally rich in wildlife, boasting sites of international importance for their rare fauna. The parish contains parts of the Bredon Hill Special Area of Conservation; parts of three Sites of Special Scientific Interest; and parts of twelve Local Wildlife Sites (the best sites in Worcestershire not covered by national designations).

Bredon Hill has been recognised as the third most important site in the UK for dead-wood beetles and other invertebrates, a large proportion of which are in Bredon. The north of the parish is the richest area in Worcestershire for rare arable plants. Kemerton Lake Nature Reserve (half in the parish), managed by the Kemerton Conservation Trust, is the West Midlands Region&#x27;s most important site for dragonflies, with 22 species recorded. It is also Worcestershire&#x27;s most important site for jack snipe, and more than 170 other bird species have been recorded here. Purple milk-vetch, violet click beetle, barbastelle bat, lesser horseshoe bat, otter, polecat and great-crested newt are some of the other interesting species found in and around the village.

<text>Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art (commonly abbreviated as Shenkar) is a public college in the Tel Aviv District city of Ramat Gan, Israel. Shenkar serves the Israeli industry by providing academic qualification and R&amp;D services for modern industries.
Shenkar is also considered as the top design school in Israel.

==History==
Shenkar was established in 1970, with the goal of serving Israeli industry. The college is named after Arie Shenkar, founder and first president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel (formerly Industrialists&#x27; Union in The Land of Israel) and a pioneer in the Israeli textile industry. Shenkar has three faculties: Multidisciplinary Art, Design and Engineering. Shenkar faculties offer four-year undergraduate degrees, taught in Hebrew. The design and the engineering faculties offer postgraduate degrees in design and in plastics engineering, respectively.

Shenkar is accredited by the Council for Higher Education in Israel as an institute of higher education and its three faculties are authorized to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Fine Arts, design and engineering. The school, in cooperation with Israel&#x27;s Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry and National Institute for Technological Training, operates a Practical Engineering school, which is located in Tel Aviv, outside of Shenkar&#x27;s main campus.

According to Fashionista magazine, Shenkar is ranked 15th in &quot;The Top 50 Fashion Schools In The World&quot; list, as of 2010.

==Classroom and research facilities==

The main campus, in Ramat Gan, consists mainly of two buildings. First, is the Frances and David Pernick Building. The Pernick Building was the first building that Shenkar occupied when the college was established in 1970. Back then, the building was an ORT high-school building that was no longer in use. In 1990, the building was renamed in honor of Frances and David Pernick. The second building is the Edward D. and Anna Mitchell Building. It was inaugurated in 2002 and built with the help of the Mitchell Foundation, the Lorber family and the Manufacturers Association of Israel. The seven-story building, which also has two underground levels, houses classrooms, and seminar rooms for design and engineering.

Outside of the main campus is the fine arts building. It is located in the Israeli Diamond Exchange District (approximately 800 meters from the main campus) and was formerly utilized as the &#x27;Elite building&#x27;.

<text>Aviatyrannis is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur, either a tyrannosauroid or an ornithomimosaurian, from the Oxfordian-Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic found in Portugal.

==Discovery and naming==
In 2000 Oliver Walter Mischa Rauhut reported the find of tyrannosauroid material in the lignite coal mine of Guimarota near Leiria, which he referred to &quot;Stokesosaurus&quot;. Later concluding the distinctiveness of the material justified a separate genus, Rauhut in 2003 named and described it as the type species &quot;Aviatyrannis jurassica&quot;. The species name was by Rauhut given the intended meaning of &quot;tyrant&#x27;s grandmother from the Jurassic&quot;. The generic name is derived from Latin &quot;avia&quot;, &quot;grandmother&quot;, and &quot;tyrannus&quot;, &quot;tyrant&quot;, on the presumption &quot;tyrannis&quot; would be its genitive. The specific name means &quot;Jurassic&quot;.

The holotype, IPFUB Gui Th 1, was found in a layer of the Alcobaça Formation dating from the early Kimmeridgian, about 155 million years old. It consists of a right ilium. Rauhut in 2003 referred two other bones to &quot;Aviatyrannis&quot;: IPFUB Gui Th 2, a partial right ilium, and IPFUB Gui Th 3, a right ischium. The referred elements represent slightly larger individuals. Additionally sixteen isolated teeth were referred: IPFUB GUI D 89-91: three teeth of the premaxilla, and IPFUB GUI D 174-186: thirteen teeth of the maxilla and dentary. These had in 1998 been described by Jens Zinke. Rauhut also hypothesised that a number of specimens referred to &quot;Stokesosaurus&quot; might actually belong to &quot;Aviatyrannis&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Aviatyrannis&quot; was a rather small theropod. The holotype specimen IPFUB Gui Th 1, for example, is an ilium only ninety millimeters long. In 2016, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at and its body mass at ; he also suggested that the holotype possibly belongs to a juvenile. The ilium is elongated and low with the typical tyrannosauroid vertical ridge on the outer blade surface above the hip joint. The teeth of the praemaxilla have a D-shaped cross-section. The maxillary and dentary teeth are elongated, only recurving near the top, with perpendicular denticles on both edges. Their bases are circular in cross-section; the top of the tooth crown is more flattened.

==Classification==
&quot;Aviatyrannis&quot; was in 2003 by Rauhut placed in the Tyrannosauroidea, in a basal position. If this placement is correct, &quot;Aviatyrannis&quot; is one of the oldest tyrannosauroids ever found, the oldest being &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot; (or, possibly, &quot;Iliosuchus&quot;). However, a 2023 paper by Hattori &quot;et al&quot;. noted that the &quot;Aviatyrannis&quot; ilium is strikingly similar to that of the newly described deinocheirid &quot;Tyrannomimus&quot;. The authors argue that, though more detailed study is needed, &quot;Aviatyrannis&quot; could be the earliest known ornithomimosaur and possibly the earliest known deinocheirid, with one analysis recovering it as a sister taxon of &quot;Tyrannomimus&quot; and the other recovering it as an ornithomimosaur outside deinocheirids and ornithomimids. The results of their phylogenetic analyses are displayed in the cladogram below:

<text>The Anglo-Welsh Cup (), was a cross-border rugby union knock-out cup competition that featured the 12 Premiership Rugby clubs and the four Welsh regions. It was a created as a replacement for the RFU Knockout Cup, which featured only English clubs.

The competition was replaced by the Premiership Rugby Cup, involving only the 12 English Premiership clubs, beginning with the 2018–19 season.

==History==
===Background===
====RFU Knockout Cup====

From 1971 to 2005, English clubs played in the RFU Knockout Cup. At its formation, it was the highest honour that a club could win, as there were no nationally organised leagues until merit leagues were introduced in 1984, followed by the full national league pyramid in 1987. It was an open tournament to any club that was a member of the Rugby Football Union.

====Previous Anglo-Welsh fixtures====
===2005–2018: Anglo-Welsh Cup===
====2005–09: Initial format====
Starting in the 2005–06 season, the Powergen Anglo-Welsh Cup was formed as a successor tournament to the Knockout Cup. It continued to be organised by the RFU, in co-operation with the Welsh Rugby Union, but featured a new format including only the twelve teams from the Guinness Premiership and the four regional Welsh sides which competed in the Celtic League. Teams from the English RFU Championship and below played in the Powergen National Trophy.

The Welsh clubs&#x27; inclusion initially caused them to be expelled from the Celtic League in June 2005. Scottish and Irish officials were angered that the Welsh regions had apparently consented to Powergen Cup fixtures on the same weekend as league matches. By the end of the month, a compromise was reached and the regions were readmitted, with the Welsh sides giving a &quot;substantial financial contribution&quot; and committing to mid-week league fixtures.

In place of the knock-out format, the 16 sides were placed in four pools with three English clubs and one Welsh region in each. The pool stages for this initial format featured one game against each team, followed by semi-finals and a final at Twickenham Stadium. The pools remained the same for the following season, with home and away fixtures reversed and the club relegated from the Premiership&#x27;s place taken by the club promoted from the Championship.

In addition to increased TV revenue (the revised Powergen Cup had a new broadcasting agreement with BBC Sport) and a possible boost to matchday income, the Powergen Cup also offered its winner, if they were a Premiership club, qualification to the even more lucrative Heineken Cup competition. As base compensation, all 16 Powergen clubs were guaranteed £250,000 each, with a prize fund of up to £200,000 available to semi-finalists.
Interest in the Powergen Cup was high during the first two rounds. Over 100,000 spectators attended matches, while the television audience peaked at 1.2 million on BBC2 for the match between the Newcastle Falcons and the Llanelli Scarlets. Overall, the 2005–06 cup drew a 12% attendance boost in the group stages over the previous year&#x27;s competition.

Powergen withdrew all of its rugby sponsorship after the conclusion of the first competition. EDF Energy took over as title sponsor for the 2006–07 tournament, renaming the tournament as the EDF Energy Cup in a deal that ran until 2009.

====2009–18: Final Format====
Insurers Liverpool Victoria became sponsors for the 2009–10 competition, rebranding the tournament as the LV= Cup until 2015.

The structure of the competition was altered at this time. It continued to consist of four pools, each consisting of three English and one Welsh team. However, the new format saw teams guaranteed two home and two away pool matches, with teams in Pools 1 and 4 playing each other and teams in Pools 2 and 3 playing each other. Early rounds of the competition now took place on international fixture dates during the Autumn Internationals and Six Nations Championship, with the aim of allowing teams to develop their squad players. It also saw the final move away from Twickenham for the first time, with Worcester&#x27;s Sixways Stadium hosting in its place. The final would continue to be played at various pre-arranged club grounds in the following years.

There was no competition in the 2015–16 season due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup being played in England, which resulted in the late start to the 2015–16 English Premiership season.

The competition returned in the 2016–17 season, known simply as the Anglo-Welsh Cup, with BT Sport taking over the live TV rights from Sky Sports and highlights shown on Channel 5.

===2018–present: Premiership Rugby Cup===

In the 2017–18 Anglo-Welsh Cup, all four of the Welsh regions finished bottom of their pools. In May 2018, the Welsh Rugby Union announced that they were going to be setting up a Welsh under-23s competition for their regions and would thus be unable to commit to Anglo-Welsh Cup games. On 10 May, Premiership Rugby Limited, which organises the English top flight, then announced that the Anglo-Welsh Cup would be replaced by the Premiership Rugby Cup, which would be solely for the English Premiership clubs. The Cup was created to continue to allow younger English Premiership players to compete in more matches at Premiership stadiums.

<doc id="642486" wikidata="Q995561" url="?curid=642486" title="Flamengo, Rio de Janeiro">
<text>Flamengo is a neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

== History ==
It is the Portuguese word for Flemish, and it was given to the nearby beach (Praia do Flamengo, &quot;Beach of the Flemish&quot;) because it was the place where the Dutch sailor Olivier van Noort tried to invade the city in 1599. At that time, the Dutchmen were called &quot;Flemish&quot; by the Portuguese.

== Characteristics ==
It is located between Catete and Botafogo districts on the edge of Guanabara Bay. The beachfront area is dominated by the Brigadier Eduardo Gomes Park, also known as &quot;Aterro do Flamengo&quot;, built by Lota de Macedo Soares on nearly 300 acres (1.2 km²) of land reclaimed from the bay and completed in 1965. The park features gardens designed by well-known Brazilian landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx.

The district and surroundings are serviced by three subway stations: Flamengo, Largo do Machado and Catete, and many bus lines that link it to the rest of the city. It is fairly close to the city centre and offers excellent views of Pão de Açúcar (Sugarloaf Mountain) and the statue of Christ the Redeemer. Nowadays, it is mostly a middle-class residential neighborhood.

Its main streets are Senador Vergueiro, Marquês de Abrantes and Praia do Flamengo.
