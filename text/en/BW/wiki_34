<text>Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (8 February 1845 – 13 February 1926) was an Anglo-Irish philosopher and political economist who made significant contributions to the methods of statistics during the 1880s. From 1891 onward, he was appointed the founding editor of &quot;The Economic Journal&quot;.

==Life==
Ysidro Francis Edgeworth – the order of his forenames later reversed – was born in Edgeworthstown, County Longford, Ireland, the son of Francis Beaufort Edgeworth and his wife, Rosa Florentina, daughter of exiled Catalan general Antonio Eroles. Francis Beaufort Edgeworth, when &quot;a restless philosophy student at Cambridge on his way to Germany&quot;, had met Rosa, a teenage Spanish refugee, on the steps of the British Museum, and they subsequently eloped. Francis Beaufort Edgeworth was the son of politician, writer, and inventor Richard Lovell Edgeworth (father also of the writer Maria Edgeworth), by his fourth wife, the botanical artist and memoirist Frances Anne, daughter of the Anglican clergyman and geographer Daniel Augustus Beaufort, of French Huguenot origin. The Edgeworth family, which settled in Ireland in the 1580s, was distinguished, descending from Francis Edgeworth, joint Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper in 1606, who inherited a fortune from his brother Edward Edgeworth, Bishop of Down and Connor. Richard Lovell Edgeworth was a descendant, through his mother, of the English judge Sir Salathiel Lovell.

The youngest of seven children, Edgeworth did not attend school, but was educated by private tutors at the Edgeworthstown estate until he reached the age to enter university.

As a student at Trinity College Dublin he studied classics getting a scholarship in 1863 and graduating in 1865. In 1867, he went to Oxford and was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford in 1868. At Oxford, Edgeworth studied ancient and modern languages. During his studies, he was influenced by Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s writings.

A voracious autodidact, he studied mathematics and economics only after he had completed university. He qualified as a barrister in London in 1877 but did not practise.

On the basis of his publications in economics and mathematical statistics in the 1880s, Edgeworth was appointed to a chair in economics at King&#x27;s College London in 1888, and in 1891, he was appointed Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford University. In 1891, he was also appointed the founding editor of &quot;The Economic Journal&quot;. He continued as editor or joint-editor until his death 35 years later.

The Royal Statistical Society awarded him the Guy Medal in Gold in 1907. Edgeworth served as the president of the Royal Statistical Society, 1912–14. In 1928, Arthur Lyon Bowley published a book entitled and devoted to &quot;F. Y. Edgeworth&#x27;s Contributions to Mathematical Statistics&quot;.

== Contributions to economics ==
Edgeworth was a highly influential figure in the development of neo-classical economics. He was the first to apply certain formal mathematical techniques to individual decision making in economics. He developed utility theory, introducing the indifference curve and the famous Edgeworth box, which is now familiar to undergraduate students of microeconomics. He is also known for the Edgeworth conjecture, which states that the core of an economy shrinks to the set of competitive equilibria as the number of agents in the economy gets larger. In statistics, Edgeworth is most prominently remembered by having his name on the Edgeworth series.

Though Edgeworth&#x27;s economic ideas were original and in depth, his contemporaries frequently complained of his manner of expression for lack of clarity. He was prone to verbosity and coining obscure words without providing definition for the reader.

=== Mathematical Psychics (1881) ===
His most original and creative book on economics was &quot;Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences&quot;, published in 1881 at the beginning of his long career in the subject.

In the book, he criticised Jevons&#x27;s theory of barter exchange, showing that under a system of &quot;recontracting&quot; there will be, in fact, many solutions, an &quot;indeterminacy of contract&quot;. Edgeworth&#x27;s &quot;range of final settlements&quot; was later resurrected by Martin Shubik (1959) to be the game-theoretic concept of &quot;the core&quot;. The book contained the first instance of the indifference curve, as level sets of the generalised utility function, &quot;U&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, ...).

The book was notoriously difficult to read. He frequently referenced literary sources and interspersed the writing with passages in a number of languages, including Latin, French and Ancient Greek. The mathematics was similarly difficult, and a number of his creative applications of mathematics to economic or moral issues were judged as incomprehensible. However, one of the most influential economists of the time, Alfred Marshall, commented in his review of &quot;Mathematical Psychics&quot;:
:&quot;This book shows clear signs of genius, and is a promise of great things to come... His readers may sometimes wish that he had kept his work by him a little longer till he had worked it out a little more fully, and obtained that simplicity which comes only through long labour. But taking it as what it claims to be, &#x27;a tentative study&#x27;, we can only admire its brilliancy, force, and originality.&quot;

Edgeworth&#x27;s close friend, William Stanley Jevons, said of &quot;Mathematical Psychics&quot;:

:&quot;Whatever else readers of this book may think about it, they would probably all agree that it is a very remarkable one... There can be no doubt that in the style of his composition Mr. Edgeworth does not do justice to his matter. His style, if not obscure, is implicit, so that the reader is left to puzzle out every important sentence like an enigma.&quot;
=== Edgeworth&#x27;s limit theorem ===

When the number of agents in an economy increases, the degree of indeterminacy is reduced.
In the limit case of an infinite number of agents (perfect competition), the set of possible contract becomes fully determinate and identical to the &#x27;equilibrium&#x27; of economists. The only way of resolving this indeterminacy of contract would be to appeal to the utilitarian principle of maximising the sum of the utilities of traders over the range of final settlements.

===International trade===
He was the first one to use offer curves and community indifference curves to illustrate its main propositions, including the &quot;optimal tariff&quot;.

===Taxation paradox===
Taxation of a good may actually result in a decrease in price.

He set the utilitarian foundations for highly progressive taxation, arguing that the optimal distribution of taxes should be such that &#x27;the marginal disutility incurred by each taxpayer should be the same&#x27; (Edgeworth, 1897).

===Monopoly pricing===
In 1897, in an article on monopoly pricing, Edgeworth criticised Cournot&#x27;s exact solution to the duopoly problem with quantity adjustments as well as Bertrand&#x27;s &quot;instantly competitive&quot; result in a duopoly model with price adjustment. At the same time, Edgeworth showed how price competition between two firms with capacity constraints and/or rising marginal cost curves resulted in indeterminacy. This gave rise to the Bertrand–Edgeworth model of oligopoly.

===Marginal productivity theory===
Edgeworth criticised the marginal productivity theory in several articles (1904, 1911), and tried to refine the neo-classical theory of distribution on a more solid basis. Although his work in questions of war finance during World War I was original, they were a bit too theoretical and did not achieve the practical influence he had hoped.

<text>The title Viscount Brackley has been created twice for members of the Egerton family; once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The first creation in the Peerage of England was in 1616 for Thomas Egerton, 1st Baron Ellesmere (1540–1617), who had been created 1st Baron Ellesmere in 1603. He died a year later and his barony and viscountcy merged with the earldom of Bridgewater, which was created for his son, John Egerton. The earldom had been meant for Thomas Egerton, but he died before he could receive it.

The second creation in the Peerage of the United Kingdom was in 1846 for Francis Egerton (1800–1857) as a subsidiary title of the earldom of Ellesmere. In 1963, the 5th Earl of Ellesmere (1915–2000) succeeded as Duke of Sutherland and the title of Viscount Brackley merged with the dukedom.

==Viscounts Brackley, first Creation (1616)==
*Thomas Egerton, 1st Baron Ellesmere (1540–1617) (created Viscount Brackley)
*John Egerton, 2nd Viscount Brackley (1579–1649) (created &quot;Earl of Bridgewater&quot; in 1617)

<text>Earl of Ellesmere ( ), of Ellesmere in the County of Shropshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1846 for the Conservative politician Lord Francis Egerton. He was granted the subsidiary title of Viscount Brackley, of Brackley in the County of Northampton, at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Born Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, he was the third son of George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland and Elizabeth Gordon, 19th Countess of Sutherland. In 1803 his father had inherited the substantial estates of his maternal uncle Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. On his father&#x27;s death in 1833, Lord Francis succeeded to the Egerton estates according to the will of the late Duke of Bridgewater, and assumed by Royal licence the surname of Egerton in lieu of Leveson-Gower. The Brackley and Ellesmere titles created for him in 1846 were revivals of titles held by the Dukes of Bridgewater. In 1963 his great-great-grandson, the fifth Earl, succeeded his kinsman as 6th Duke of Sutherland. The earldom of Ellesmere and viscountcy of Brackley are now subsidiary titles of the dukedom.

The Hon. Alfred Egerton, younger son of the second Earl, represented Eccles in Parliament.

The family seat was Worsley New Hall.

Worry often interferes with daily functioning, and individuals with GAD are often overly concerned about everyday matters such as health, finances, death, family, relationship concerns, or work difficulties. Symptoms may include excessive worry, restlessness, trouble sleeping, exhaustion, irritability, sweating, and trembling.

Symptoms must be consistent and ongoing, persisting at least six months for a formal diagnosis. Individuals with GAD often have other disorders including other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder), substance use disorder, or obesity, and may have a history of trauma or family with GAD. Clinicians use screening tools such as the GAD-7 and GAD-2 questionnaires to determine if individuals may have GAD and warrant formal evaluation for the disorder. Additionally, sometimes screening tools may enable clinicians to evaluate the severity of GAD symptoms.

GAD is believed to have a hereditary or genetic basis (e.g., first-degree relatives of an individual who has GAD are themselves more likely to have GAD), but the exact nature of this relationship is not fully appreciated. Genetic studies of individuals who have anxiety disorders (including GAD) suggest that the hereditary contribution to developing anxiety disorders is only approximately 30–40%, which suggests that environmental factors may be more important to determining whether an individual develops GAD. There is a strong overlapping relationship between GAD and major depressive disorder (MDD), with 72% of those with a lifelong diagnosis of GAD also being diagnosed with MDD at some point in their lives.

Treatment includes psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] or metacognitive therapy) and pharmacological intervention. CBT and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., escitalopram, sertraline, and fluoxetine) are first-line psychological and pharmacological treatments; other options include serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., duloxetine and venlafaxine). In more severe, last resort cases, benzodiazepines such as diazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam are used, though not as first-line drugs as benzodiazepines are frequently abused and habit forming. In Europe, pregabalin is also used. The positive effects (if any) of complementary and alternative medications (CAMs), exercise, therapeutic massage and other interventions have been studied.

Estimates regarding prevalence of GAD or lifetime risk for GAD vary depending upon which criteria are used for diagnosing GAD (e.g., DSM-5 or ICD-10) although estimates do not vary widely between diagnostic criteria. In general, ICD-10 is more inclusive than DSM-5, so estimates regarding prevalence and lifetime risk tend to be greater using ICD-10. In regard to prevalence, in a given year, about two (2%) percent of adults in the United States and Europe have been suggested to have GAD. However, the risk of developing GAD at any point in life has been estimated at 9.0%. Although it is possible to experience a single episode of GAD during one&#x27;s life, most people who experience GAD experience it repeatedly over the course of their lives as a chronic or ongoing condition. GAD is diagnosed twice as frequently in women as in men.

==Causes==
===Genetics, family and environment===
The relationship between genetics and anxiety disorders is an ongoing area of research. It is broadly understood that there exists a hereditary basis for GAD, but the exact nature of this hereditary basis is not fully understood.  While investigators have identified several genetic loci that are regions of interest for further study, there is no singular gene or set of genes that have been identified as causing GAD.  Nevertheless, genetic factors may play a role in determining whether an individual is at greater risk for developing GAD, structural changes in the brain related to GAD, or whether an individual is more or less likely to respond to a particular treatment modality.  Genetic factors that may play a role in development of GAD are usually discussed in view of environmental factors (e.g., life experience or ongoing stress) that might also play a role in development of GAD. The traditional methods of investigating the possible hereditary basis of GAD include using family studies and twin studies (there are no known adoption studies of individuals who have anxiety disorders, including GAD). Meta-analysis of family and twin studies suggests that there is strong evidence of a hereditary basis for GAD in that GAD is more likely to occur in first-degree relatives of individuals who have GAD than in non-related individuals in the same population. Twin studies also suggest that there may be a genetic linkage between GAD and major depressive disorder (MDD), which may explain the common occurrence of MDD in individuals who have GAD (e.g., comorbidity of MDD in individuals with GAD has been estimated at 60%). When GAD is considered among all anxiety disorders (e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety disorder), genetic studies suggest that hereditary contribution to the development of anxiety disorders amounts to only approximately 30–40%, which suggests that environmental factors are likely more important to determining whether an individual may develop GAD. In regard to environmental influences in the development of GAD, it has been suggested that parenting behaviour may be an important influence since parents potentially model anxiety-related behaviours. It has also been suggested that individuals with GAD have experienced a greater number of minor stress-related events in life and that the number of stress-related events may be important in development of GAD (irrespective of other individual characteristics).

Studies of possible genetic contributions to the development of GAD have examined relationships between genes implicated in brain structures involved in identifying potential threats (e.g., in the amygdala) and also implicated in neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors known to be involved in anxiety disorders. More specifically, genes studied for their relationship to development of GAD or demonstrated to have had a relationship to treatment response include:

* PACAP (A54G polymorphism): remission after 6-month treatment with Venlafaxine suggested to have a significant relationship with the A54G polymorphism (Cooper et al. (2013))
* HTR2A gene (rs7997012 SNP G allele): HTR2A allele suggested to be implicated in a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms associated with response to 6 months of Venlafaxine treatment (Lohoff et al. (2013))
* SLC6A4 promoter region (5-HTTLPR): Serotonin transporter gene suggested to be implicated in significant reduction in anxiety symptoms in response to 6 months of Venlafaxine treatment (Lohoff et al. (2013))

== Pathophysiology ==

The pathophysiology of GAD is an active and ongoing area of research often involving the intersection of genetics and neurological structures. GAD has been linked to changes in functional connectivity of the amygdala and its processing of fear and anxiety. Sensory information enters the amygdala through the nuclei of the basolateral complex (consisting of lateral, basal and accessory basal nuclei). The basolateral complex processes the sensory-related fear memories and communicates information regarding threat importance to memory and sensory processing elsewhere in the brain, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and sensory cortices. Neurological structures traditionally appreciated for their roles in anxiety include the amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). It is broadly postulated that changes in one or more of these neurological structures are believed to allow greater amygdala response to emotional stimuli in individuals who have GAD as compared to individuals who do not have GAD.

Individuals with GAD have been suggested to have greater amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation in response to stimuli than individuals who do not have GAD. However, the exact relationship between the amygdala and the frontal cortex (e.g., prefrontal cortex or the orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]) is not fully understood because there are studies that suggest &quot;increased or decreased&quot; activity in the frontal cortex in individuals who have GAD. Consequently, because of the tenuous understanding of the frontal cortex as it relates to the amygdala in individuals who have GAD, it&#x27;s an open question as to whether individuals who have GAD bear an amygdala that is more sensitive than an amygdala in an individual without GAD or whether frontal cortex hyperactivity is responsible for changes in amygdala responsiveness to various stimuli. Recent studies have attempted to identify specific regions of the frontal cortex (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [dmPFC]) that may be more or less reactive in individuals who have GAD or specific networks that may be differentially implicated in individuals who have GAD. Other lines of study investigate whether activation patterns vary in individuals who have GAD at different ages with respect to individuals who do not have GAD at the same age (e.g., amygdala activation in adolescents with GAD).

==Diagnosis==

===DSM-5 criteria===
The diagnostic criteria for GAD as defined by the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition&quot; (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, are paraphrased as follows:No major changes to GAD have occurred since publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (2004); minor changes include wording of diagnostic criteria.

===ICD-10 criteria===
The 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Disease (ICD-10) provides a different set of diagnostic criteria for GAD than the DSM-5 criteria described above. In particular, ICD-10 allows diagnosis of GAD as follows:

See ICD-10 F41.1 Note: For children different ICD-10 criteria may be applied for diagnosing GAD (see F93.80).

==Treatment==
Traditional treatment modalities broadly fall into two categories, i.e., psychotherapeutic and pharmacological intervention. In addition to these two conventional therapeutic approaches, areas of active investigation include complementary and alternative medications (CAMs), brain stimulation, exercise, therapeutic massage and other interventions that have been proposed for further study. Treatment modalities can, and often are, utilized concurrently so that an individual may pursue psychological therapy (i.e., psychotherapy) and pharmacological therapy. Both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medications (such as SSRIs) have been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety. A combination of both CBT and medication is generally seen as the most desirable approach to treatment. Use of medication to lower extreme anxiety levels can be important in enabling patients to engage effectively in CBT.

=== Psychotherapy ===
Psychotherapeutic interventions include a plurality of therapy types that vary based upon their specific methodologies for enabling individuals to gain insight into the working of the conscious and subconscious mind and which sometimes focus on the relationship between cognition and behavior. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is widely regarded as the first-line psychological therapy for treating GAD. Additionally, many of these psychological interventions may be delivered in an individual or group therapy setting. While individual and group settings are broadly both considered effective for treating GAD, individual therapy tends to promote longer-lasting engagement in therapy (i.e., lower attrition over time).

==== Psychodynamic therapy ====
Psychodynamic therapy is a type of therapy premised upon Freudian psychology in which a psychologist enables an individual explore various elements in their subconscious mind to resolve conflicts that may exist between the conscious and subconscious elements of the mind. In the context of GAD, the psychodynamic theory of anxiety suggests that the unconscious mind engages in worry as a defense mechanism to avoid feelings of anger or hostility because such feelings might cause social isolation or other negative attribution toward oneself. Accordingly, the various psychodynamic therapies attempt to explore the nature of worry as it functions in GAD in order to enable individuals to alter the subconscious practice of using worry as a defense mechanism and to thereby diminish GAD symptoms. Variations of psychotherapy include a near-term version of therapy, &quot;short-term anxiety-provoking psychotherapy (STAPP).

==== Behavioral therapy ====
Behavioral therapy is therapeutic intervention premised upon the concept that anxiety is learned through classical conditioning (e.g., in view of one or more negative experiences) and maintained through operant conditioning (e.g., one finds that by avoiding a feared experience that one avoids anxiety). Thus, behavioral therapy enables an individual to re-learn conditioned responses (behaviors) and to thereby challenge behaviors that have become conditioned responses to fear and anxiety, and which have previously given rise to further maladaptive behaviors.

==== Cognitive therapy ====
Cognitive therapy (CT) is premised upon the idea that anxiety is the result of maladaptive beliefs and methods of thinking. Thus, CT involves assisting individuals to identify more rational ways of thinking and to replace maladaptive thinking patterns (i.e., cognitive distortions) with healthier thinking patterns (e.g., replacing the cognitive distortion of catastrophizing with a more productive pattern of thinking). Individuals in CT learn how to identify objective evidence, test hypotheses, and ultimately identify maladaptive thinking patterns so that these patterns can be challenged and replaced.

====Acceptance and commitment therapy====
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a behavioral treatment based on acceptance-based models. ACT is designed with the purpose to target three therapeutic goals: (1) reduce the use of avoiding strategies intended to avoid feelings, thoughts, memories, and sensations; (2) decreasing a person&#x27;s literal response to their thoughts (e.g., understanding that thinking &quot;I&#x27;m hopeless&quot; does not mean that the person&#x27;s life is truly hopeless), and (3) increasing the person&#x27;s ability to keep commitments to changing their behaviors. These goals are attained by switching the person&#x27;s attempt to control events to working towards changing their behavior and focusing on valued directions and goals in their lives as well as committing to behaviors that help the individual accomplish those personal goals. This psychological therapy teaches mindfulness (paying attention on purpose, in the present, and in a nonjudgmental manner) and acceptance (openness and willingness to sustain contact) skills for responding to uncontrollable events and therefore manifesting behaviors that enact personal values.

====Intolerance of uncertainty therapy====
Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) refers to a consistent negative reaction to uncertain and ambiguous events regardless of their likelihood of occurrence. Intolerance of uncertainty therapy (IUT) is used as a stand-alone treatment for GAD patients. Thus, IUT focuses on helping patients in developing the ability to tolerate, cope with and accept uncertainty in their life in order to reduce anxiety. IUT is based on the psychological components of psychoeducation, awareness of worry, problem-solving training, re-evaluation of the usefulness of worry, imagining virtual exposure, recognition of uncertainty, and behavioral exposure. Studies have shown support for the efficacy of this therapy with GAD patients with continued improvements in follow-up periods.

====Motivational interviewing====
A promising innovative approach to improving recovery rates for the treatment of GAD is to combine CBT with motivational interviewing (MI). Motivational interviewing is a strategy centered on the patient that aims to increase intrinsic motivation and decrease ambivalence about change due to the treatment. MI contains four key elements: (1) express empathy, (2) heighten dissonance between behaviors that are not desired and values that are not consistent with those behaviors, (3) move with resistance rather than direct confrontation, and (4) encourage self-efficacy. It is based on asking open-ended questions and listening carefully and reflectively to patients&#x27; answers, eliciting &quot;change talk&quot;, and talking with patients about the pros and cons of change. Some studies have shown the combination of CBT with MI to be more effective than CBT alone.

==== Cognitive behavioral therapy ====
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based type of psychotherapy that demonstrates efficacy in treating GAD and which integrates the cognitive and behavioral therapeutic approaches. The objective of CBT is to enable individuals to identify irrational thoughts that cause anxiety and to challenge dysfunctional thinking patterns by engaging in awareness techniques such as hypothesis testing and journaling. Because CBT involves the practice of worry and anxiety management, CBT includes a plurality of intervention techniques that enable individuals to explore worry, anxiety and automatic negative thinking patterns. These interventions include anxiety management training, cognitive restructuring, progressive relaxation, situational exposure and self-controlled desensitization. Several modes of delivery are effective in treating GAD, including internet-delivered CBT, or iCBT.

====Emotion-focused therapy====

Emotion-focused therapy (EFT) is a short-term psychotherapy that is focused on humanistic needs of emotions when treating individuals with GAD. EFT can incorporate numerous practices such as experimental therapy, systemic therapy, and elements of CBT to allow individuals to work through difficult emotional states. The primary goal of EFT is assisting individuals in living with their vulnerable emotions and overcoming avoidance so that adaptive experiences such as compassion and protective anger can be generated in response to the emotional needs that are embedded in core emotional vulnerability.

====Sandplay therapy====

Sandplay therapy (SPT) is an intervention based on nonverbal therapeutic practices. The main objective of SPT is to allow the individual the ability to work through their emotional problems from childhood traumas (CT) through play using sand and toy figures. Although the therapy is mainly focused on nonverbal cues, verbal cues are also observed and documented during the rehabilitation process of the individual. SPT allows a multi-sensory experience through a safe and protected space allowing the individual the opportunity to regulate their mind and emotions. This therapeutic practice is offered in both adults and children.

====Exposure therapy====
There is empirical evidence that exposure therapy can be an effective treatment for people with GAD, citing specifically in vivo exposure therapy (exposure through a real-life situation), which has greater effectiveness than imaginal exposure in regards to generalized anxiety disorder. The aim of in vivo exposure treatment is to promote emotional regulation using systematic and controlled therapeutic exposure to traumatic stimuli. Exposure is used to promote fear tolerance.

Exposure therapy is also a preferred method for children who struggle with anxiety.

====Other forms of psychological therapy====

* Relaxation techniques (e.g., relaxing imagery, meditational relaxation)
* Metacognitive therapy (MCT): The objective of MCT is to alter thinking patterns regarding worry so that worry is no longer used as a coping strategy. It has promising results in treatment of GAD as well as other mental issues.
* Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR)
* Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT): The goal of MBCT is to be used as an alternative or adjunctive to Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).
* Supportive therapy: This is a Rogerian method of therapy in which subjects experience empathy and acceptance from their therapist to facilitate increasing awareness. Variations of active supportive therapy include Gestalt therapy, Transactional analysis and Counseling.
* Internet-delivered interpretation training: The focus of this training is to reduce worry and anxiety while promoting positive outcomes and positive interpretations.

=== Pharmacotherapy ===
Medications that have been studied were reviewed in a recent network meta-analysis that compared all studied medications with placebo and also with each other and another compared the rates of remission between different medications. Benzodiazepines (BZs) have been used to treat anxiety starting in the 1960s. There is a risk of dependence and tolerance to benzodiazepines. BZs have a number of effects that make them a good option for treating anxiety including anxiolytic, hypnotic (induce sleep), myorelaxant (relax muscles), anticonvulsant, and amnestic (impair short-term memory) properties. While BZs work well to alleviate anxiety shortly after administration, they are also known for their ability to promote dependence and are frequently used recreationally or non-medically. Antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs / SNRIs) have become a mainstay in treating GAD in adults. First-line medications from any drug category often include those that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other similar regulatory body such as the EMA or TGA for treating GAD because these drugs have been shown to be safe and effective.

==== FDA-approved medications for treating GAD ====
FDA-approved medications for treating GAD include: 

==== Non-FDA approved medications ====
While certain medications are not specifically FDA approved for treatment of GAD, there are a number of medications that historically have been used or studied for treating GAD. Other medications that have been used or evaluated for treating GAD include:

* SSRIs
** Citalopram
** Fluoxetine
** Sertraline
** Fluvoxamine
* Benzodiazepines
** Clonazepam
** Lorazepam
** Diazepam
* GABA analogs
** Pregabalin
** Tiagabine
* Second-generation antipsychotics
** Olanzapine (evidence of effectiveness is merely a trend)
** Ziprasidone
** Risperidone
** Aripiprazole (studied as an adjunctive measure in concert with other treatment)
** Quetiapine (atypical antipsychotic studied as an adjunctive measure in adults and geriatric patients)
* Antihistamines
** Hydroxyzine (H1 receptor antagonist)
** Mirtazapine (atypical antidepressant having 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor affinity)
* Tricyclic antidepressants
** Amitriptyline
** Clomipramine
** Doxepin
** Imipramine
** Trimipramine
** Desipramine
** Nortriptyline
** Protriptyline
** Opipramol (atypical TCA)
** Trazodone
* Monamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
** Tranylcypromine
** Phenelzine

====Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors====
Pharmaceutical treatments for GAD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs increase serotonin levels through inhibition of serotonin reuptake receptors.

FDA approved SSRIs used for this purpose include escitalopram and paroxetine. However, guidelines suggest using sertraline first due to its cost-effectiveness compared to other SSRIs used for generalized anxiety disorder and a lower risk of withdrawal compared to SNRIs. If sertraline is found to be ineffective, then it is recommended to try another SSRI or SNRI.

Common side effects include nausea, sexual dysfunction, headache, diarrhea, constipation, restlessness, increased risk of suicide in young adults and adolescents, among others. Sexual side effects, weight gain, and higher risk of withdrawal are more common in paroxetine than escitalopram and sertraline. In older populations or those taking concomitant medications that increase risk of bleeding, SSRIs may further increase the risk of bleeding. Overdose of an SSRI or concomitant use with another agent that causes increased levels of serotonin can result in serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening.

====Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors====

First line pharmaceutical treatments for GAD also include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). These inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline to increase their levels in the CNS.

FDA approved SNRIs used for this purpose include duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor). While SNRIs have similar efficacy as SSRIs, many psychiatrists prefer to use SSRIs first in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The slightly higher preference for SSRIs over SNRIs as a first choice for treatment of anxiety disorders may have been influenced by the observation of poorer tolerability of the SNRIs in comparison to SSRIs in systematic reviews of studies of depressed patients.

Side effects common to both SNRIs include anxiety, restlessness, nausea, weight loss, insomnia, dizziness, drowsiness, sweating, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction and weakness. In comparison to SSRIs, the SNRIs have a higher prevalence of the side effects of insomnia, dry mouth, nausea and high blood pressure. Both SNRIs have the potential for discontinuation syndrome after abrupt cessation, which can precipitate symptoms including motor disturbances and anxiety and may require tapering. Like other serotonergic agents, SNRIs have the potential to cause serotonin syndrome, a potentially fatal systemic response to serotonergic excess that causes symptoms including agitation, restlessness, confusion, tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, ataxia, myoclonus, muscle rigidity, diaphoresis, diarrhea, headache, shivering, goose bumps, high fever, seizures, arrhythmia and unconsciousness. SNRIs like SSRIs carry a black box warning for suicidal ideation, but it is generally considered that the risk of suicide in untreated depression is far higher than the risk of suicide when depression is properly treated.

====Pregabalin and gabapentin====
Pregabalin (Lyrica) is effective for treating GAD. It acts on the voltage-dependent calcium channel to decrease the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine and substance P. Its therapeutic effect appears after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to lorazepam, alprazolam and venlafaxine but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of tolerance and additionally, unlike benzodiazepines, it does not disrupt sleep architecture and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment. It also has a low potential for misuse and dependency and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons. The anxiolytic effects of pregabalin appear to persist for at least six months continuous use, suggesting tolerance is less of a concern; this gives pregabalin an advantage over certain anxiolytic medications such as benzodiazepines.

Gabapentin (Neurontin), a closely related medication to pregabalin with the same mechanism of action, has also demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of GAD, though unlike pregabalin, it has not been approved specifically for this indication. Nonetheless, it is likely to be of similar usefulness in the management of this condition, and by virtue of being off-patent, it has the advantage of being significantly less expensive in comparison. In accordance, gabapentin is frequently prescribed off-label to treat GAD.

==== Complementary and alternative medicines studied for potential in treating GAD ====
Complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) are widely used by individuals with GAD despite having no evidence or varied evidence regarding efficacy. Efficacy trials for CAM medications often have various types of bias and low quality reporting in regard to safety. In regard to efficacy, critics point out that CAM trials sometimes predicate claims of efficacy based on a comparison of a CAM against a known drug after which no difference in subjects is found by investigators and which is used to suggest an equivalence between a CAM and a drug. Because this equates a lack of evidence with the positive assertion of efficacy, a &quot;lack of difference&quot; assertion is not a proper claim for efficacy. Moreover, an absence of strict definitions and standards for CAM compounds further burdens the literature regarding CAM efficacy in treating GAD. CAMs academically studied for their potential in treating GAD or GAD symptoms along with a summary of academic findings are given below. What follows is a summary of academic findings. Accordingly, &quot;none of the following should be taken as offering medical guidance or an opinion as to the safety or efficacy of any of the following CAMs.&quot;

# Kava Kava (&quot;Piper methysticum&quot;) extracts: Meta analysis does not suggest efficacy of Kava extracts due to few data available yielding inconclusive results or non-statistically significant results. Nearly a quarter (25.8%) of subjects experienced adverse effects (AEs) from Kava Kava extracts during six trials. Kava Kava may cause liver toxicity.
# Lavender (&quot;Lavandula angustifolia&quot;) extracts: Small and varied studies may suggest some level of efficacy as compared to placebo or other medication; claims of efficacy are regarded as needing further evaluation. Silexan is an oil derivative of Lavender studied in pediatric patients with GAD. Concern exists regarding the question as to whether Silexan may cause unopposed estrogen exposure in boys due to disruption of steroid signaling.
# &quot;Galphimia glauca&quot; extracts: While Galphima glauca extracts have been the subject of two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Galphima glauca extracts to lorazepam, efficacy claims are regarded as &quot;highly uncertain.&quot;
# Chamomile (&quot;Matricaria chamomilla&quot;) extracts: Poor quality trials have trends that may suggest efficacy but further study is needed to establish any claim of efficacy.
# &quot;Crataegus oxycantha&quot; and &quot;Eschscholtzia californica&quot; extracts combined with magnesium: A single 12-week trial of Crataegus oxycantha and Eschscholtzia californica compared to placebo has been used to suggest efficacy. However, efficacy claims require confirmation studies. For the minority of subjects who experienced AEs from extracts, most AEs implicated gastrointestinal tract (GIT) intolerance.
# &quot;Echium amoneum&quot; extract: A single, small trial used this extract as a supplement to fluoxetine (vs using a placebo to supplement fluoxetine); larger studies are needed to substantiate efficacy claims.
# &quot;Gamisoyo-San&quot;: Small trials of this herbal mixture compared to placebo have suggested no efficacy of the herbal mixture over placebo but further study is necessary to allow definitive conclusion of a lack of efficacy.
# Passiflora incarnata extract: Claims of efficacy or benzodiazepine equivalence are regarded as &quot;highly uncertain.&quot;
# &quot;Valeriana extract&quot;: A single 4-week trial suggests no effect of Valeriana extract on GAD but is regarded as &quot;uninformative&quot; on the topic of efficacy in view of its finding that the benzodiazepine diazepam also had no effect. Further study may be warranted.

==== Lifestyle ====
Lifestyle factors including: stress management, stress reduction, relaxation, sleep hygiene, and caffeine and alcohol reduction can influence anxiety levels. Physical activity has shown to have a positive impact whereas low physical activity may be a risk factor for anxiety disorders.

There has also been increasing evidence behind exercise substantially alleviating anxiety.
===Substances and GAD===
Certain substances or the withdrawal from certain substances have been implicated in promoting the experience of anxiety. For example, even while benzodiazepines may afford individuals with GAD relief from anxiety, withdrawal from benzodiazepines is associated with the experience of anxiety among other adverse events like sweating and tremor.

Nicotine withdrawal symptoms may provoke anxiety in tobacco smokers and excessive caffeine use has been linked to aggravating and maintaining anxiety.

==Comorbidity==

===Depression===
A longitudinal cohort study found 12% of 972 participants had GAD comorbid with major depressive disorder. Accumulating evidence indicates that patients with comorbid depression and anxiety tend to have greater illness severity and a lower treatment response than those with either disorder alone. In addition, social function and quality of life are more greatly impaired.

For many, the symptoms of both depression and anxiety are not severe enough (i.e., are subsyndromal) to justify a primary diagnosis of either major depressive disorder (MDD) or an anxiety disorder. However, dysthymia is the most prevalent comorbid diagnosis of GAD clients. Patients can also be categorized as having mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, though this is an unstable diagnosis that typically either goes away or shifts to a different diagnosis later on.

Various explanations for the high comorbidity between GAD and depressive disorders have been suggested, ranging from genetic pleiotropy (i.e., GAD and nonbipolar depression might represent different phenotypic expressions of a common etiology ) to impaired executive control or sleep problems and fatigue as potential bridging mechanisms between the two disorders.

===Comorbidity and treatment===
Therapy has been shown to have equal efficacy in patients with GAD and patients with GAD and comorbid disorders. Patients with comorbid disorders have more severe symptoms when starting therapy, but demonstrated a greater improvement than patients with GAD alone.

Pharmacological approaches (i.e., the use of antidepressants) must be adapted for different comorbidities. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines are used for depression and anxiety. However, for patients with anxiety and a substance use disorder, benzodiazepines should be avoided due to their addictive properties. CBT has been found an effective treatment since it improves symptoms of GAD and substance use.

Compared to the general population, patients with internalizing disorders such as depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have higher mortality rates, but die of the same age-related diseases as the population, such as heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and cancer.

Patients with GAD can sometimes present with symptoms such as insomnia or headaches.

There is also observed comorbidity between GAD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder occur in a minority of individuals with ADHD, but more often than in the general population. Further research suggests that about 20 to 40 percent of individuals with ADHD have comorbid anxiety disorders, with GAD being the most prevalent.

Those with GAD have a lifetime comorbidity prevalence of 30% to 35% with alcohol use disorder and 25% to 30% for another substance use disorder. People with both GAD and a substance use disorder also have a higher lifetime prevalence for other comorbidities. A study found that GAD was the primary disorder in slightly more than half of the 18 participants that were comorbid with alcohol use disorder.

== Epidemiology ==
GAD is often estimated to affect approximately 3–6% of adults and 5% of children and adolescents. Although estimates have varied to suggest a GAD prevalence of 3% in children and 10.8% in adolescents. When GAD manifests in children and adolescents, it typically begins around 8 to 9 years of age.

Estimates regarding prevalence of GAD or lifetime risk (i.e., lifetime morbid risk [LMR]) for GAD vary depending upon which criteria are used for diagnosing GAD (e.g., DSM-5 vs ICD-10) although estimates do not vary widely between diagnostic criteria. In general, ICD-10 is more inclusive than DSM-5, so estimates regarding prevalence and lifetime risk tend to be greater using ICD-10. In regard to prevalence, in a given year, about two (2%) percent of adults in the United States and Europe have been suggested to have GAD. However, the risk of developing GAD at any point in life has been estimated at 9.0%. Although it is possible to experience a single episode of GAD during one&#x27;s life, most people who experience GAD experience it repeatedly over the course of their lives as a chronic or ongoing condition. GAD is diagnosed twice as frequently in women as in men and is more often diagnosed in those who are separated, divorced, unemployed, widowed or have low levels of education, and among those with low socioeconomic status. African Americans have higher odds of having GAD and the disorder often manifests itself in different patterns. It has been suggested that greater prevalence of GAD in women may be because women are more likely than men to live in poverty, are more frequently the subject of discrimination, and be sexually and physically abused more often than men. In regard to the first incidence of GAD in an individual&#x27;s life course, a first manifestation of GAD usually occurs between the late teenage years and the early twenties with the median age of onset being approximately 31 and mean age of onset being 32.7. However, GAD can begin or reoccur at any point in life. Indeed, GAD is common in the elderly population.

=== United States ===
United States: Approximately 3.1 percent of people age 18 and over in a given year (9.5 million).

=== UK ===
5.9 percent of adults were affected by GAD in 2019.

=== Other ===

*Australia: 3 percent of adults
*Canada: 2.5 percent
*Italy: 2.9 percent
*Taiwan: 0.4 percent

== History==
The American Psychiatric Association introduced GAD as a diagnosis in the DSM-III in 1980, when anxiety neurosis was split into GAD and panic disorder. The definition in the DSM-III required uncontrollable and diffuse anxiety or worry that is excessive and unrealistic and persists for 1 month or longer. High rates in comorbidity of GAD and major depression led many commentators to suggest that GAD would be better conceptualized as an aspect of major depression instead of an independent disorder. Many critics stated that the diagnostic features of this disorder were not well established until the DSM-III-R. Since comorbidity of GAD and other disorders decreased with time, the DSM-III-R changed the time requirement for a GAD diagnosis to 6 months or longer. The DSM-IV changed the definition of &quot;excessive worry&quot; and the number of associated psychophysiological symptoms required for a diagnosis. Another aspect of the diagnosis the DSM-IV clarified was what constitutes a symptom as occurring &quot;often&quot;. The DSM-IV also required difficulty controlling the worry to be diagnosed with GAD. The DSM-5 emphasized that excessive worrying had to occur more days than not and on a number of different topics. It has been stated that the constant changes in the diagnostic features of the disorder have made assessing epidemiological statistics such as prevalence and incidence difficult, as well as increasing the difficulty for researchers in identifying the biological and psychological underpinnings of the disorder. Consequently, making specialized medications for the disorder is more difficult as well. This has led to the continuation of GAD being medicated heavily with SSRIs.

<doc id="641709" wikidata="Q1129742" url="?curid=641709" title="Earl of Bridgewater">
<text>Earl of Bridgewater was a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England, once for the Daubeny family (1538) and once for the Egerton family (1617). From 1720 to 1803, the Earls of Bridgewater also held the title of Duke of Bridgewater. The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater is famously known as the &quot;Canal Duke&quot;, for his creation of a series of canals in North West England.

==History==
===Creation for the Daubeny family (1538)===
The title Earl of Bridgewater was first created in 1538 for Henry Daubeny, 9th Baron Daubeny. The Daubeney (or Dabney) family descended from Elias Daubeny, who in 1295 was summoned by writ to the Model Parliament as Lord Daubeny. The eighth Baron was created Baron Daubeny by letters patent in the Peerage of England in 1486 and was also made a Knight of the Garter the following year. All three titles became extinct on the first Earl of Bridgewater&#x27;s death in 1548.

===Creation for the Egerton family (1617)===
The title Earl of Bridgewater was created secondly in 1617 for John Egerton, Baron Ellesmere and Viscount Brackley, after the town of Bridgwater in Somerset, where he owned estates. The Egerton family descended from Sir Richard Egerton of Ridley, Cheshire, whose illegitimate son Sir Thomas Egerton was a prominent lawyer who served as Master of the Rolls from 1594 to 1603, as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal from 1593 to 1603 and as Lord High Chancellor of England from 1603 to 1617. Thomas Egerton was knighted in 1594, admitted to the Privy Council in 1596 and in 1603 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Ellesmere, in the County of Shropshire, and in 1616 to Viscount Brackley. In 1598 he had inherited the Tatton estate in Cheshire from his brother-in-law Richard Brereton. He was succeeded by his son, John who represented Callington and Shropshire in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of several counties in Wales and western England and who in 1617 was made Earl of Bridgewater in the Peerage of England.

He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, the second Earl. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, Lancashire, Cheshire and Herefordshire. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was a Whig politician and served as First Lord of Trade and as First Lord of the Admiralty. His eldest son from his first marriage, John Egerton, died as an infant, while his two elder sons from his second marriage, Charles Egerton, Viscount Brackley, and the Hon. Thomas Egerton, both died in the fire which destroyed Bridgwater House in London. Lord Bridgewater was succeeded by his eldest surviving son from his second marriage, the fourth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire and also held several positions at court. In 1720 he was created Marquess of Brackley, in the County of Northampton, and Duke of Bridgewater, in the County of Somerset. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The first Duke outlived his two elder sons and was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son from his second marriage, the second Duke. He died from fever at an early age. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Duke. He is remembered as the father of British inland navigation and commissioned the Bridgewater Canal, said to be the first true canal in Britain and the modern world. Bridgewater never married and on his death in 1803 the marquessate and dukedom became extinct.

The last Duke was succeeded in the other titles by his first cousin once removed, the seventh Earl. He was the son of the Right Reverend the Hon. John Egerton, Bishop of Durham, son of the Right Reverend the Hon. Henry Egerton, Bishop of Hereford, youngest son of the third Earl. Lord Bridgewater was a General in the Army and also sat as Tory Member of Parliament for Morpeth and for Brackley. He was childless and on his death in 1823 the titles passed to his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was known as a patron of science as well as a great eccentric. Lord Bridgewater never married and on his death in 1829 his titles became extinct.

In the early 17th century, Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley, had purchased Ashridge House in Hertfordshire, one of the largest country houses in England, from Queen Elizabeth I, who had inherited it from her father who had appropriated it after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. Ashridge House served the Egerton family as a residence until the 19th century. The Egertons later had a family chapel (the Bridgewater Chapel) with burial vault in Little Gaddesden Church, where many monuments commemorate the Dukes and Earls of Bridgewater and their families. Among those buried here is the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater.

Lady Amelia Egerton, sister of the seventh and eighth Earls, married Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet. Their daughter Sophia Hume married John Cust, 1st Earl Brownlow. Their grandson John William Spencer Brownlow Egerton-Cust, 2nd Earl Brownlow (1842–1867), assumed the additional surname of Egerton and inherited the Bridgewater estates after a lengthy lawsuit (see the Baron Brownlow for additional information on the Cust family). Also, Lady Louisa Egerton, daughter of the first Duke of Bridgewater, married Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford. Their son George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Marquess of Stafford, was created Duke of Sutherland in 1833. His second son Lord Francis Leveson-Gower assumed by Royal licence the surname of Egerton in lieu of Leveson-Gower according to the will of the third Duke of Bridgewater. In 1846 the Brackley and Ellesmere titles were revived when he was made Viscount Brackley and Earl of Ellesmere. The Hon. Thomas Egerton, of Tatton Park, Cheshire, youngest son of the second Earl of Bridgewater, was the grandfather of Hester Egerton (d. 1780). She married William Tatton. In 1780 they assumed by Royal licence the surname of Egerton in lieu of Tatton. Their great-grandson William Tatton Egerton was created Baron Egerton in 1859.

A scoundrel claiming to be the long-lost but rightful Duke of Bridgewater appears in the 1885 novel &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; by Mark Twain, which is set before the American Civil War.

The original spelling is likely to have been Bridgwater, meaning the burg of Water, and the same as Bridgwater in Somerset (see archive reference 2/79).

<text>In geometry, a limaçon or limacon , also known as a limaçon of Pascal or Pascal&#x27;s Snail, is defined as a roulette curve formed by the path of a point fixed to a circle when that circle rolls around the outside of a circle of equal radius. It can also be defined as the roulette formed when a circle rolls around a circle with half its radius so that the smaller circle is inside the larger circle. Thus, they belong to the family of curves called centered trochoids; more specifically, they are epitrochoids. The [[cardioid]] is the special case in which the point generating the roulette lies on the rolling circle; the resulting curve has a cusp.

Depending on the position of the point generating the curve, it may have inner and outer loops (giving the family its name), it may be heart-shaped, or it may be oval.

A limaçon is a bicircular rational plane algebraic curve of degree 4.

==History==
The earliest formal research on limaçons is generally attributed to Étienne Pascal, father of Blaise Pascal. However, some insightful investigations regarding them had been undertaken earlier by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer. Dürer&#x27;s &quot;Underweysung der Messung (Instruction in Measurement)&quot; contains specific geometric methods for producing limaçons. The curve was named by Gilles de Roberval when he used it as an example for finding tangent lines.

==Equations==
The equation (up to translation and rotation) of a limaçon in polar coordinates has the form

:formula_1

This can be converted to Cartesian coordinates by multiplying by &quot;r&quot; (thus introducing a point at the origin which in some cases is spurious), and substituting formula_2 and formula_3 to obtain

:formula_4

Applying the parametric form of the polar to Cartesian conversion, we also have

:formula_5
:formula_6

while setting

:formula_7

yields this parameterization as a curve in the complex plane:

:formula_8

If we were to shift horizontally by formula_9, i.e.,

:formula_10,

we would, by changing the location of the origin, convert to the usual form of the equation of a centered trochoid. Note the change of independent variable at this point to make it clear that we are no longer using the default polar coordinate parameterization formula_11.

===Special cases===
In the special case formula_12, the polar equation is

:formula_13 

or 

:formula_14 

making it a member of the sinusoidal spiral family of curves. This curve is the cardioid.

In the special case formula_15, the centered trochoid form of the equation becomes

:formula_16

or, in polar coordinates,

:formula_17

making it a member of the rose family of curves. This curve is a trisectrix, and is sometimes called the limaçon trisectrix.

==Form==
When formula_18, the limaçon is a simple closed curve. However, the origin satisfies the Cartesian equation given above, so the graph of this equation has an acnode or isolated point.

When formula_19, the area bounded by the curve is convex, and when formula_20, the curve has an indentation bounded by two inflection points. At formula_21, the point formula_22 is a point of 0 curvature.

As formula_23 is decreased relative to formula_24, the indentation becomes more pronounced until, at formula_25, the curve becomes a cardioid, and the indentation becomes a cusp. For formula_26, the cusp expands to an inner loop, and the curve crosses itself at the origin. As formula_23 approaches 0, the loop fills up the outer curve and, in the limit, the limaçon becomes a circle traversed twice.

==Measurement==
The area enclosed by the limaçon formula_28 is formula_29. When formula_30 this counts the area enclosed by the inner loop twice. In this case the curve crosses the origin at angles formula_31, the area enclosed by the inner loop is

:formula_32 

the area enclosed by the outer loop is 

:formula_33 

and the area between the loops is 

:formula_34

The circumference of the limaçon is given by a complete elliptic integral of the second kind:

:formula_35

==Relation to other curves==
* Let formula_36 be a point and formula_37 be a circle whose center is not formula_36. Then the envelope of those circles whose center lies on formula_37 and that pass through formula_36 is a limaçon.
* A pedal of a circle is a limaçon. In fact, the pedal with respect to the origin of the circle with radius formula_23 and center formula_42 has polar equation formula_28.

* The inverse with respect to the unit circle of formula_28 is 

::formula_45 

:which is the equation of a conic section with eccentricity formula_46 and focus at the origin. Thus a limaçon can be defined as the inverse of a conic where the center of inversion is one of the foci. If the conic is a parabola then the inverse will be a cardioid, if the conic is a hyperbola then the corresponding limaçon will have an inner loop, and if the conic is an ellipse then the corresponding limaçon will have no loop.

* The conchoid of a circle with respect to a point on the circle is a limaçon.

* A particular special case of a Cartesian oval is a limaçon.

<text>The Ill ( ; , ) is a river in Alsace, in north-eastern France, and a left-bank, or western, tributary of the Rhine. It is long.

It starts down from its source near the village of Winkel, in the Jura mountains, with a resurgence near Ligsdorf, turns around Ferrette on its east side, and then runs northward through Alsace, flowing parallel to the Rhine. Taking apart the Largue, also coming from the Jura mountains near Illfurth, it receives several tributaries from the west bank Vosges mountains after passing through Altkirch: the Doller in Mulhouse, the Thur near Ensisheim, the Lauch in Colmar, the Fecht in Illhaeusern, the Giessen in Sélestat, the Andlau near Fegersheim, the Ehn near Geispolsheim, the Bruche next to Strasbourg and the Souffel upstream from La Wantzenau before meeting with the Rhine downstream from Gambsheim&#x27;s lock. As the Ill nears the city of Mulhouse, most of its flow is diverted into a discharge channel leading to the Doller, protecting the historical center of the town from floods.

Flowing through the city of Strasbourg, the river forms part of the 17th-century fortifications and passes through a series of locks and channels in the picturesque old town, including the Petite France quarter, where its waters were once used to power mills and tanneries. One of these channels is the &quot;Canal du Faux-Rempart&quot; that, together with the main channel of the Ill, surrounds the Grande Île or historic centre of Strasbourg.

== Navigation ==
The Ill is currently navigable from a junction with the &quot;Canal de la Marne au Rhin&quot; for a distance of just under upstream to a head of navigation at Nachtweid. This stretch of river passes through the centre of Strasbourg, and makes connection with the &quot;Canal du Faux-Rempart&quot;, the &quot;Canal du Rhone au Rhine&quot; and the, no longer navigable, &quot;Canal de la Bruche&quot;. There is a single lock, in the Petite France quarter of central Strasbourg.

Navigation through the section of the central part of this section, through Petite France, is restricted to small pleasure craft in the downstream direction only; upstream traffic and commercial traffic must use an indirect route from the &quot;Canal de la Marne au Rhin&quot; to the &quot;Canal du Rhone au Rhine&quot; via the Port of Strasbourg. Passenger trip boats use this section in the opposite direction, completing their loop via the &quot;Canal du Faux-Rempart&quot; that is closed to all other traffic.

Other stretches of the Ill, downstream of the &quot;Canal de la Marne au Rhin&quot; to the confluence with the Rhine, and upstream of Nachtweid, are not navigable by powered craft, although they may be used by canoes and similar craft.

<doc id="641739" wikidata="Q352107" url="?curid=641739" title="Robert T. Bakker">
<text>Robert Thomas Bakker (born March 24, 1945) is an American paleontologist who helped reshape modern theories about dinosaurs, particularly by adding support to the theory that some dinosaurs were endothermic (warm-blooded). Along with his mentor John Ostrom, Bakker was responsible for initiating the ongoing &quot;dinosaur renaissance&quot; in paleontological studies, beginning with Bakker&#x27;s article &quot;Dinosaur Renaissance&quot; in the April 1975 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;. His specialty is the ecological context and behavior of dinosaurs.

Bakker has been a major proponent of the theory that dinosaurs were warm-blooded, smart, fast, and adaptable. He published his first paper on dinosaur endothermy in 1968. His seminal work, &quot;The Dinosaur Heresies,&quot; was published in 1986. He revealed the first evidence of parental care at nesting sites for &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. He also observed evidence in support of Eldredge and Gould&#x27;s theory of punctuated equilibrium in dinosaur populations. Bakker currently serves as the Curator of Paleontology for the Houston Museum of Natural Science.

==Biography==

Bakker was born in Bergen County, New Jersey. He attributes his interest in dinosaurs to his reading an article in the September 7, 1953, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. He graduated from Ridgewood High School in 1963.

At Yale University Bakker studied under John Ostrom, an early proponent of the new view of dinosaurs, and later earned his PhD at Harvard. He began by teaching anatomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland and Earth and Space Sciences, where future artist Gregory S. Paul worked and collaborated informally under his guidance. Most of Bakker&#x27;s fieldwork has been done in Wyoming, especially at Como Bluff. Still, he has traveled as far as Mongolia and South Africa in search of dinosaur habitats. He also worked as an assistant at the University of Colorado.

==Theories==

In his 1986 work &quot;The Dinosaur Heresies&quot;, Bakker puts forth the theory that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. His evidence for this includes:
* Almost all modern animals that walk upright are warm-blooded, and dinosaurs walked upright.
* The hearts of warm-blooded animals can pump much more effectively than the hearts of cold-blooded animals. Therefore, the giant &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; must have had the type of heart associated with warm-blooded animals in order to pump blood up to its head.
* Dinosaurs such as &quot;Deinonychus&quot; led a very active life, behavior which is much more compatible with a warm-blooded animal.
* Some dinosaurs lived in northern latitudes where it would have been impossible for cold-blooded dinosaurs to maintain their body temperature.
* The rapid rate of speciation and evolution found in dinosaurs is typical of warm-blooded animals and atypical of cold-blooded animals.
* The hypothesized population ratios of predatory dinosaurs to their prey is a signature trait of warm-blooded predators rather than cold-blooded ones.
* Birds are warm-blooded and evolved from dinosaurs; therefore, a change to a warm-blooded metabolism must have taken place at some point. There is far more change between dinosaurs and their ancestors (basal archosaurs) than between non-avian dinosaurs and birds.
* A warm-blooded metabolism is an evolutionary advantage for top predators and large herbivores; if dinosaurs had not been warm-blooded there should be fossil evidence of warm-blooded animals evolving to fill these ecological niches. No such evidence exists; in fact, by the end of the Cretaceous, mammals had become much smaller than their stem-mammal ancestors.
* Dinosaurs grew rapidly, evidence for which can be found by observing cross-sections of their bones. Warm-blooded animals grow at a similar rate.

Bakker is also a proponent of the idea that flowering plants evolved because of their interactions with dinosaurs. He also believes the principal cause of extinction for all non-avian dinosaurs was in fact a plague caused by invasive species crossing land bridges, retorting that, had the comet been large enough to kill off every non-avian dinosaur, it would have also wiped out the various taxa known to have survived the K-T extinction event.

==Writing==
Bakker&#x27;s fictional novel &quot;Raptor Red&quot; tells of a year in the life of a female &quot;Utahraptor&quot; during the lower Cretaceous. In the story, Bakker elaborates on his knowledge of the behavior of dromaeosaurids (&quot;raptor&quot; dinosaurs) and life at the time of their existence.

==Religious beliefs==
As a Pentecostal, Ecumenical Christian minister, Bakker has said there is no real conflict between religion and science, and that evolution of species and geologic history is compatible with religious belief. Bakker views the Bible as an ethical and moral guide, rather than a literal timetable of events in the history of life. He has advised non-believers and creationists to read the views put forward by Saint Augustine, who argued against a literal understanding of the Book of Genesis.

==Influence on popular media==
Bakker&#x27;s earliest known appearance was in the 1976 BBC Nova episode &quot;The Hot-Blooded Dinosaurs&quot; aired on WGBH Boston.

Bakker actively participated in the 1985 CBS documentary &quot;Dinosaur!&quot;, appearing several times in the programme.

Bakker appears in the 1989 BBC series &quot;Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives&quot; presented by David Attenborough, in the third episode &quot;Dinosaur&quot; discussing his theory regarding &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and other theropods being warm-blooded animals. Bakker later renamed &quot;Attenborosaurus&quot;, a species of plesiosaur after Sir David.

Bakker was featured heavily in the documentary, &quot;The Great Dinosaur Hunt&quot;, part of The Infinite Voyage series of documentaries. &quot;The Great Dinosaur Hunt&quot; first aired on Jan 4, 1989. 

Bakker was an advisor for the 1992 PBS series, &quot;The Dinosaurs!&quot;. He had many appearances in the TLC television series &quot;Paleoworld&quot;, and was also among the advisors for the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, with some of the early concept art being informed by Bakker&#x27;s works. Bakker also appeared in the Sega CD version of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

Dr. Bakker was a guest in episode 27 (&quot;Surprise&quot;) of the Williams Street original &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

Bakker appeared in the 1992 VHS &quot;Whatever Happened to the Dinosaurs?&quot;

He was profiled on location at his Wyoming dinosaur excavation site in an episode of the &quot;Discover Magazine (TV series)&quot; on The Disney Channel in 1992.

Bakker and his 1986 book are mentioned in the original &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. The bearded paleontologist Dr. Robert Burke, who is eaten by a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, is an affectionate caricature of Bakker. In real life, Bakker has argued for a predatory &quot;T. rex&quot;, while Bakker&#x27;s rival paleontologist Jack Horner views it as primarily a scavenger. According to Horner, Spielberg wrote the character of Burke and had him killed by the &quot;T. rex&quot; as a favor for Horner. After the film came out, Bakker recognized himself in Burke, loved the caricature, and actually sent Horner a message saying, &quot;See, I told you &quot;T. rex&quot; was a hunter!&quot;

<text>Charles Lewis Napier (April 12, 1936 – October 5, 2011) was an American actor who was known for playing supporting and occasional leading roles in television and films. He was frequently cast as police officers, soldiers, or authority figures, many of them villainous or corrupt. After leaving his Kentucky hometown to serve in the Army, he graduated from college and worked as a sports coach and art teacher before settling on acting as a career. His first prominent role in a film was in &quot;Cherry, Harry &amp; Raquel!&quot; (1969), which was the first of four films he would do with director Russ Meyer. Napier established himself in character roles and worked steadily for the next 35 years. He made numerous collaborations with director Jonathan Demme, including roles in &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986), &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988), &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993), &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (2004).

Other notable roles include the short-tempered country singer Tucker McElroy in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), gruff army Commander Gilmour in &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997), General Hawk in &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999), and bureaucratic CIA officer Marshall Murdock in &quot;&quot; (1985). He also had numerous voiceover roles in television, most notably the character of Duke Phillips on the prime time animated sitcom &quot;The Critic&quot; and Agent Zed in &quot;Men in Black: The Series&quot;.

==Early life==
Napier was born in Mt. Union, Kentucky near Scottsville. His parents were Sara Lena (née Loafman; 1897–1974) and Linus Pitts Napier (1888–1991). After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army in 1954, serving with the 511th Infantry Regiment, 11th Airborne Division and rising to the rank of sergeant.

In 1958, after his service, he attended Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, graduating in 1961 with a major in art and minor in physical education. He wanted to be a basketball coach and his first job was as an assistant coach at his old high school in Allen County, coaching under Allen County legend James Bazzell. Soon after, he gave up coaching, eventually taking jobs with a bridge company and an advertising agency before moving to Clearwater, Florida to teach art at John F. Kennedy Junior High School.

In 1964, Napier returned to Western Kentucky to attend graduate school, where instructor D. Russell Miller encouraged him to pursue acting. Following some success in the local Alley Playhouse, Napier moved back to Florida where he continued to teach as well as act in community theater, eventually moving into Clearwater&#x27;s Little Theatre as its live-in caretaker. During this time he also pursued painting.

==Career==
After a spell in New York, Napier moved to California. He acquired an agent and a union card (for a bit part in &quot;&quot;). His film debut came about by accident. A girlfriend took Napier along when she went to audition for Russ Meyer, who cast Napier as the male lead in &quot;Cherry, Harry &amp; Raquel!&quot;. (He was one of the few actors from Meyer films to go on and have a significant career.) In addition to acting and helping with the cameras when setting up shots, he did stunts, make up and driving on the film. After the low budget &quot;Moonfire&quot;, he worked as a journalist and photographer for &quot;Overdrive&quot; magazine for a few years; a strike sent him back to Hollywood in 1975 where, at age 39, he was reduced to living in his car in the parking lot of Meyer&#x27;s office with no money, work or agent. He was summoned to Universal Studios to meet Alfred Hitchcock (who had just seen a print of &quot;Supervixens&quot;) and Napier was given a one-year contract.

Napier became a prolific character actor, appearing regularly in TV series of the time, and a number of pilots. Frequently cast as a heavy, he often portrayed corrupt cops, soldiers, businessmen and other authority figures. In 1977, he was cast as frontier scout Luther Sprague in the six-episode NBC western television series, &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;. He appeared in three episodes of the 1980s hit TV series &quot;The A-Team&quot; as Col. Briggs. Also a bit part as Jarret in Labour Pains He also co-starred in two &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; episodes, and played Hammer in the series &quot;B.J. and the Bear&quot; in the 1970s. Napier as Wolfson Lucas was teamed with Rod Taylor again for the series &quot;Outlaws&quot;. He is known among &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans for appearing on both &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episodes &quot;The Way to Eden&quot; as musically inclined space hippie Adam, and the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Little Green Men&quot; as General Denning. He also appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Knight Rider&quot; in 1982.

&quot;Citizen&#x27;s Band&quot; director Jonathan Demme was laudatory about Napier&#x27;s abilities, and went on to cast him in several of his films including &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and, in what was Napier&#x27;s favourite role of his career, a judge in &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. He played the bureaucratic CIA officer Marshall Murdock in &quot;&quot;. In the 1980 musical-comedy &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, he portrayed the apoplectic Tucker McElroy, &quot;lead singer of and driver of the Winnebago&quot; for &quot;The Good Ol&#x27; Boys.&quot;

Napier was in many advertisements. He performed a great deal of voice-over work in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Critic&quot;, &quot;Men in Black: The Series&quot;, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, and vocal effects for the Hulk in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; following the death of Ted Cassidy in 1979. He also provided several guest voices for episodes of &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;

He had a small role during the sixth season of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; in 2008 as a barber who assaults and drives Larry David from his shop after David offends him. Napier appeared in the 2009 horror film &quot;Murder World&quot; alongside Scout Taylor-Compton. His last film role was in the 2009 comedy &quot;The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard&quot; opposite Jeremy Piven and James Brolin.

Prior to his death in October 2011, Napier published a book about his life and experiences in Hollywood, titled &quot;Square Jaw and Big Heart&quot;.

==Personal life==
Napier was married twice. His first wife was Delores Wilson. After his divorce, he married Dee Napier. Napier and his wife appeared on &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; in 2003 to discuss his obsession with being famous. According to the Dr. Phil Show website, &quot;Despite appearing in close to 100 films and countless hit TV shows, Charles Napier says he&#x27;s depressed he&#x27;s not a big star. His wife, Dee, says that instead of becoming upset when he gets rejected for a part, Charles should be grateful and proud of his 35-year career. She also thinks it&#x27;s time he started making the family, not the pursuit of fame, his priority.&quot;

Napier and his second wife had two children, son Hunter and daughter Meghan Saralena. Napier also had one son, Charles Lewis &quot;Chuck&quot; Napier Jr., from his previous marriage.

==Death==
Napier died in Bakersfield, California, on October 5, 2011, after having collapsed the previous day. He was 75 years old. The exact cause of death was not released, but Napier had been treated for deep vein thrombosis in his legs in May 2010.

<doc id="641753" wikidata="Q2885893" url="?curid=641753" title="New Kids on the Blecch">
<text>&quot;New Kids on the Blecch&quot; is the fourteenth episode of the twelfth season of the American television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on Fox in the United States on February 25, 2001. In the episode, a music producer selects Bart, Nelson, Milhouse and Ralph to be members of the next hit boy band, who record songs containing subliminal messages about joining the Navy.

The episode was written by Tim Long and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode&#x27;s title is a play on the boy band New Kids on the Block and &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; tendency to use the word &quot;blecch&quot; in their parodic titles.

The episode has received positive reviews from critics and was watched by over 18 million viewers.

==Plot==
After watching an Olympic Games documentary on TV, Homer decides to participate in the Springfield marathon to prove to Marge that he is fit. Bart dons a stereotypical Italian disguise and wins the marathon by cheating, but a bird pulls off his fake mustache during the trophy presentation. To escape from the outraged crowd, Bart accepts a ride from a stranger, who introduces himself as music producer L.T. Smash. He offers Bart a chance to join a boy band he is assembling called Party Posse, including Nelson, Ralph and Milhouse. Bart accepts the opportunity, and the four boys quickly rise to stardom, secretly using voice-enhancing software developed by NASA to improve their singing abilities.

Party Posse releases a single &quot;Drop Da Bomb&quot; whose accompanying music video includes the strange line &quot;YVAN EHT NIOJ&quot; in its chorus. Puzzled, Lisa analyzes the video and finds a subliminal recruiting message for the United States Navy within it; she also realizes that the chorus is simply &quot;JOIN THE NAVY&quot; sung backwards. Seeing that the single&#x27;s hidden message is beginning to affect the Springfield populace, after watching Otto Mann board a navy bus right in front of the Simpsons&#x27; house, Lisa confronts Smash, who reveals himself as a Navy lieutenant and explains that popular music has long been used as a recruiting tool by the military. After Lisa confronts Homer and Marge, they dismiss her claims as stemming from jealousy of Bart&#x27;s fame.

During a Party Posse concert aboard an aircraft carrier, in which the band performs a song full of subliminal lyrics, Smash&#x27;s superior officer informs him that the boy band project is being shut down because Party Posse is due to be satirized in an upcoming issue of &quot;Mad&quot;, sabotaging their recruiting power. The officer turns off Party Posse&#x27;s voice enhancers, exposing the boys&#x27; lack of singing talent and destroying their popularity. Enraged, Smash commandeers the carrier, sending his superior officer overboard, and taking it out to sea as the terrified audience jumps overboard and swims back to the docks. Smash sails the carrier to New York City with the band and Homer (who was in the lavatory at the time) still onboard, and declares his intention to destroy the &quot;Mad&quot; headquarters. Despite the sudden arrival of boy band NSYNC, Smash fires the missiles and destroys the building. The employees survive unharmed and Smash is arrested; Bart and his friends are disappointed at not having a chance to appear in &quot;Mad&quot;, but take comfort in reading the planned parody of them.

The episode ends with praise for the Navy by NSYNC, who suggest that viewers enlist. JC Chasez is surprised and dismayed to learn that his bandmates have signed him up without his knowledge, and two military police officers drag him away screaming.

==Production==
The episode was written by Tim Long and directed by Steven Dean Moore. Mike Scully was frustrated that they had not pitched enough story ideas, so he pitched this episode, along with &quot;Trilogy of Error&quot;. During the pitch session, he suggested that NSYNC guest star on one of the pitched episodes. The decision to add a government conspiracy came late, an idea which was pitched by George Meyer. At the table read for the episode, the cast ad-libbed the lyrics and music. During production, it was decided that the kids would not do their own singing, to get a boy band sound and to help Nancy Cartwright (who otherwise voices three of the four), so the producers hired the band Natural for the &quot;Studio Magic&quot; voices, and recorded them in Orlando.

NSYNC instantly said yes to being asked to guest star, although Justin Timberlake had to record his lines separately from the rest of the band due to a family death. During the recording session, the staff brought their kids along to meet the band. Tom Hanks, who was filming &quot;Cast Away&quot; in the same studio, wanted to meet them and came by. The song that introduces NSYNC every time they walk in is &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;. Timberlake was reluctant to say &quot;Word&quot; since he swore it was something he would never say, so as a joke the editing team reused the one take where he said &quot;Word&quot; after nearly every line. Footage of the band recording their lines for the episode was featured over the end credits. On the top of the building of Classified Records, where the band first records their music, the sheet music for &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; can be seen.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;New Kids on the Blecch&quot; was viewed by 18.1 million viewers with a 9.7 rating/15 share; this made it the top rated animated show of the week.

Annie Alleman of &quot;The Herald News&quot; named the episode her fourth favorite &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said &quot;When it parodies boy bands, &#x27;Blecch&#x27; has its moments. Granted, it&#x27;s tough to really mock boy bands, as they always bordered on self-parody; the Party Posse tunes sound a lot like the real thing. Still, the show works pretty well until it gets to the Navy side of things. Then it just becomes dopey and lacks the moderate bite of the earlier scenes. The show also becomes unintentionally eerie when it features an attack on New York&quot; (something that would happen in real life just over six months after this episode was first broadcast). Judge Mac McEntire said the best moment of the episode was the irate choreographer. Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press listed NSYNC as one of the top five worst musical guests in &quot;Simpsons&quot; history.

At one point in the episode, a flag is depicted on the side of a technical employed by military fighters in Middle Eastern dress. The flag in the episode resembles the flag adopted by the Syrian opposition in the Syrian Civil War, but is actually the Independence flag. The resemblance was cited by some supporters of the Syrian government and media in the Middle East as evidence that the Syrian rebellion was a foreign plot.

<text>The cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichii), also known as Wallich&#x27;s pheasant or chir pheasant, is a vulnerable species of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. It is the only member in the genus &quot;Catreus&quot;. The scientific name commemorates Danish botanist Nathaniel Wallich.

==Description==
These birds lack the color and brilliance of most pheasants, with buffy gray plumage and long, gray crests. Its long tail has 18 feathers and the central tail feathers are much longer and the colour is mainly gray and brown. The female is slightly smaller in overall size.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Males are monogamous. They breed on steep cliffs during summer with a clutch of 10 to 11 eggs.
In studies conducted in upper Beas Valley, cheer pheasant was found to be sensitive to human disturbance.

==Habitat and distribution==
The cheer pheasant is distributed in the highlands and scrublands of the Himalaya region of India, Nepal and Pakistan. They are found mainly in western Nepal, Uttarakhand (Kumaon and Garhwal), Himachal Pradesh (Shimla, Kullu and Chamba), and Jammu and Kashmir in northwestern India, and Hazara division, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in northern Pakistan. Surveys in 1981 and 2003 in the Dhorpatan area of western Nepal established 70 calling sites, suggesting substantial numbers exist in this area (about 200 birds). In another survey in 2010, cheer pheasants were detected in 21 calling sites in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. They are found mainly above 6000 feet altitude and up to 10000 feet in summer.

==Status and conservation==
Due to ongoing habitat loss, small population size, and hunting in some areas, the cheer pheasant is evaluated as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. Attempts to reintroduce captive-bred cheer pheasants in Pakistan have been unsuccessful.

<doc id="641783" wikidata="Q3018341" url="?curid=641783" title="Bread clip">
<text>A bread clip is a device that is used to hold plastic bags closed, such as those in which sliced bread is commonly packaged. They are also commonly called bread tags, bread tabs, bread ties, bread buckles, or bread-bag clips. By sealing a bag more securely than tying or folding over its open end, and thus providing a nearly hermetic seal, the contents are preserved longer.

==Designs==
===Simple===
Most designs of bread clip consist of a single plastic part through which the neck of a plastic bag can be threaded. Because these clips are cheap, ubiquitous, and come in a variety of shapes and colors, some people collect them.

Most bread clips are made from plastic #6 polystyrene (PS), but Quebec-based bread clip manufacturing company KLR Systems released recyclable, cardboard bread clips in 2019, which they later switched to producing in 2022.

Such clips are also used for bagged milk. In the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, the most common package is 4 litres—three 1.33-litre sealed bags in a larger bag, which is closed with a clip and imprinted with the milk&#x27;s expected expiration date.

===Mechanical===

A more complex bread clip design involves two articulated plastic parts mounted on a pivot with a spring between them to provide tension.

==History==
The bread clip was invented by Floyd G. Paxton and manufactured by the Kwik Lok Corporation, based in Yakima, Washington with manufacturing plants in Yakima and New Haven, Indiana. Kwik Lok Corporation&#x27;s clips are called &quot;Kwik Lok closures&quot;.

Paxton was known for repeatedly telling the story about how he came up with the idea of the bread clip. As he told it, he was flying home on an airliner in 1952 and opened a bag of peanuts, whereupon he realized he had no way to reclose it. He rummaged through his wallet and found an expired credit card and hand-carved his first bag clip with a small pen knife. When a fruit packer, Pacific Fruit, wanted to replace rubber bands with a better bag closure for its new plastic bags, Paxton remembered his bag of peanuts. He hand-whittled another clip from a small sheet of Plexiglas. With an order in hand for a million clips, Paxton designed a die-cut machine to produce the clips at high speed. Despite repeated attempts, Paxton never won a United States patent for the clips themselves. He did, however, win numerous patents for the high-speed &quot;bag closing apparatus&quot; that made the clips, inserted bread into the bags, and applied the clips to said bags.

The bread clip was developed in the early 1950s for a growing need to close plastic bags on the packaging line very efficiently. Manufacturers, using more and more automation in the manufacture and packaging of food, needed methods to raise production volumes and reduce costs. At the same time a hurried population of consumers wanted a fast and easy way to open and effectively seal food bags. The simple bread clip sufficed. In addition, re-closability became a selling point as smaller families and higher costs slowed consumption, leading to a potential for higher rates of spoilage.

Kwik Lok continues to be the main manufacturer of bread clips with Schutte as their European competitor.

==Parody in media==
The parody website horg.com, created by John Daniel, coined the term occlupanids to describe bread clips, and created a mock phylogeny of the different clip designs, as well as a formal taxonomy including &quot;families&quot; and binomial scientific names. Researchers of occlupanids are called occlupanologists. These terms have since been referenced in popular media.

==Health risks==
Case studies in the medical literature document instances of inhalation and ingestion.

<doc id="641784" wikidata="Q133751" url="?curid=641784" title="Catasetum">
<text>Catasetum, abbreviated as Ctsm. in horticultural trade, is a genus of showy epiphytic Orchids, family Orchidaceae, subfamily Epidendroideae, tribe Cymbidieae, subtribe Catasetinae, with currently 200 accepted species, many of which are highly prized in horticulture.

Species of the genus &quot;Catasetum&quot; occur from Mexico to Argentina, including much of Central America, the West Indies, and South America. The largest number of species is in Brazil.

== Biology ==

They have thick, cigar-shaped pseudobulbs which are clustered. The leaves are pleated in the upper part and deciduous. The pseudobulbs become spiny after the leaves have dropped.

=== Pollination ===

The inflorescence is borne on the basis. It consists of very fleshy flowers that are unisexual, which is very unusual for orchids. The colorful male and yellowish-green female flowers are typically situated on different plants, a phenomenon known as dioecy. Which type of flower a plant produces is determined by the conditions under which it grows. Male and female flowers are markedly different in size and color. Initially, taxonomists thought they were dealing with different species, a puzzle which Charles Darwin resolved when writing &quot;Fertilisation of Orchids&quot;. There are rare cases in which a single plant in intermediate conditions will produce both male and female flowers.
The male flowers have a remarkable technique for the ejection of the pollinia. Sack-shaped Catasetum (&quot;Catasetum saccatum&quot;), a tropical South American species, discussed by Darwin, actually launches its viscid pollen sacs with explosive force, when an insect touches a seta. He was ridiculed for reporting this by the naturalist Thomas Huxley.

=== Growth ===
In habitat, these plants predominantly grow as epiphytes in very wet forests. Species of this genus all host wood-devouring mycorrhizal fungi which supplement the plants&#x27; nutrition by breaking down decomposing wood. Most of these species have a prolonged saprophytic stage in decomposing wood as seedlings before developing leaves and photosynthesis. Fungi which break down wood require a nitrogen source since wood is primarily composed solely of hemi-cellulose, cellulose, and lignin and lacks nitrogen, and these plants are heavy feeders with high nitrogen requirements typically.

Many of these species are known to germinate in ant nests high in the canopy and host ant colonies, which provide the plants with an abundant supply of nitrogen, and they also host ants in cultivation frequently. Most of these species are considered moderately difficult to maintain in cultivation without a greenhouse or Wardian case and some of them defy cultivation. Most of them cannot tolerate dryness and some of them have very specific temperature requirements. Some of these species are ant plants and attract ant colonies and can become a nuisance in cultivation.

<text>Gannon University is a private Catholic university with campuses in Erie, Pennsylvania, and Ruskin, Florida, United States. Established in 1925, Gannon University enrolls approximately 4,600 undergraduate and graduate students annually. Its intercollegiate athletics include 18 athletic programs for men and women competing at the NCAA Division II level. It plans to merge with Ursuline College by the end of 2026.

==History==
Gannon University was first established in 1933 as the two-year Cathedral College by the Diocese of Erie under the leadership of Joseph J. &quot;Doc&quot; Wehrle. In 1944, the school became the four-year men&#x27;s school Gannon College of Arts and Sciences, named in honor of the then-Bishop of Erie, John Mark Gannon, the driving force behind its opening and development. The college became coeducational in 1964 and gained university status in 1979.

The all-girls school Villa Maria College, which was founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1925, merged with the university in 1989. Its &quot;Villa Maria School of Nursing&quot; retains the name of the original institution.

In 2024, the university&#x27;s board of trustees approved plans to merge the university with Ursuline College. Ursuline will become a part of Gannon as &quot;Ursuline College Campus of Gannon University&quot; with its own academic and athletic programs.

==Academics==

The university is organized into three main colleges: the College of Engineering and Business, which includes the Dahlkemper School of Business Administration; the College of Humanities, Education and Social Sciences; and the Morosky College of Health Professions and Sciences.

==Campus==
Gannon University&#x27;s campus is located in downtown Erie, primarily concentrated between Peach and Myrtle Streets and 3rd and 10th Streets. In summer 2015, a doctoral branch campus opened in Ruskin, Florida focusing on healthcare majors.

==Rankings== 
Gannon University was ranked No. 260 in 2024 in National Universities by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Its rank rose to No. 244 in 2025.

==Athletics==
Gannon is a member of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference in NCAA Division II. Gannon offers 19 Division II scholarship-granting varsity sports, that includes nine men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. The men participate in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, water polo, wrestling, competitive cheer. The women participate in basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, acrobatics and tumbling, and competitive cheer and dance.

In June 2007, Gannon University, along with cross-town rival Mercyhurst College, was accepted into the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference, where area schools Pennsylvania Western University, Edinboro and Slippery Rock University are members. Along with Gannon and Mercyhurst as full members, LIU Post also was accepted into the conference as an affiliate member.

<text>Essex is the name of several ships:

* For [[East Indiamen]], see 
* For [[Royal Navy]] ships, see 
* For [[US Navy]] ships, see .
**&quot;Essex Junior&quot; was the British whaler &quot;Atlantic&quot; that Captain David Porter, of the American frigate , captured off the Galapagos Islands on 29 April 1813, renamed, and used as a tender. The Royal Navy recaptured &quot;Essex Junior&quot;, and used her as a cartel. The Americans then seized her when she brought her passengers to New York.

Four American ships that have worked as [[whaler]]s (whaling ships) have borne the name Essex:
* , was launched in Hampton, New Hampshire, and made at least two whaling voyages. 
* , was launched in Amesbury, Massachusetts, and made seven recorded whaling voyages; she is most famous for the last, which ended when a whale rammed and sank her in November 1820.
* , was launched at Amesbury, Massachusetts, and made some eight recorded whaling voyages before she was condemned at Montevideo in January 1843.
* , was launched at Saybrook, Connecticut, and made one recorded whaling voyage.

Many merchant vessels have also borne the name:
* , of 302 tons (bm), was built in 1808 in the U.S. She was condemned in the Prize Court on 20 May 1809 for trading with the enemy. Peter Everitt Maestaer then purchased her and retained her name. She was deleted from the register at Cape Town on 12 July 1832 after having been sold for breaking up.
* , of 554 tons (bm) was launched on 13 October 1810 by John Brockbank &amp; Nephew, Lancaster, for J. Wildman &amp; Co. She sailed under two letters of marque. The first was issued on 28 October 1811 to Robert Muirhead, master, for &quot;Essex&quot;, ship, of 554 tons. It gave her armament as twenty 12-pounder guns. The second was issued on 16 October 1813 to Gabriel Ford, master, for &quot;Essex&quot;, ship, of 554 tons. This time her armament was described as twelve 9 and 12-pounder guns.
* &quot;Essex&quot;, a 329-ton sailing ship that the New Zealand Company chartered to bring immigrants to New Plymouth in 1843

<doc id="641817" wikidata="Q2096756" url="?curid=641817" title="Sid Meier's Pirates!">
<text>Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates! is a video game created by Sid Meier for the Commodore 64 and published by MicroProse in May 1987. It was the first game to include the name &quot;Sid Meier&quot; in its title as an effort by MicroProse to attract fans of Meier&#x27;s earlier games, most of which were combat vehicle simulation video games. The game is a simulation of the life of a pirate, a privateer, or a pirate hunter in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. It was widely ported to other systems.

&quot;Pirates!&quot; is set in the Caribbean. The &quot;Pirates!&quot; playing field includes the Spanish Main (namely the northern coast of South America), Central America and the Yucatán Peninsula, the entire Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and all Caribbean islands, plus Bermuda in the PC version. The player is free to sail to any part of the above-mentioned lands, stopped by an invisible barrier southeast of Trinidad, all the way north to just northeast of Bermuda.

The &quot;Pirates! Gold&quot; remake, with minor improvements and better graphics, was released in 1993. An enhanced remake, also named &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot;, was released in 2004. Versions for mobile devices have also been released.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pirates!&quot; is a single-player, open-world game. The player receives a letter of marque authorizing service as a privateer for the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of England, or the French colonial empire in the Caribbean. The player&#x27;s loyalties may change over the course of the game; they may also hold rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase their wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. As the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point they are given a position in their future life, from beggar to King&#x27;s advisor, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.

The era of play is one of the choices given to a player at game-start. Different eras provide a different challenge, as political and economic power shifts between the four fledgling European empires. Choosing 1560 (the earliest choice) as the starting year places the player in the Caribbean almost devoid of influence but that of Spain, while 1680 (the latest choice) provides a mature Caribbean with many non-Spanish colonies and an overall higher degree of activity in the region. The other choices include 1600, 1620, 1640, and 1660, with the progressive effect of reducing Spanish dominance in favor of the other nations, while increasing seafaring traffic. Ship designs are also era-dependent, with some types of ships appearing more frequently in certain eras and less in others, and certain ship types being used near-exclusively by certain nations.

The game tests a wide range of skills: hand-eye coordination during the fencing sections, tactical ability during the land and sea combat phases, and strategic thinking, for everything from choosing a wife to deciding when to divide up the plunder. Moreover, each game is likely to take a different course, as most events in the game are random, including the economic and political systems, and early in the game, these can greatly affect future strategic options. In the course of the game a player may try to tack in a frigate in order to run down a smaller and faster pinnace, but must be fortunate enough to have the weather gage.

One of the most innovative features of &quot;Pirates!&quot; is the introduction of a dynamic playing field. In &quot;Pirates!&quot; many of the most important factors which affect player decisions are randomized at the beginning of the game and continue to shift during gameplay. This not only creates a new experience each time the game is played, but also requires the player to remain flexible, and be ready to exploit possibilities when they occur. Changes happen whenever time passes and they are unrelated to player actions. In fact, in this game in the series, random events do not have any graphical representation, and the player can do nothing to prevent them.

The most important random factor in the game lies in the diplomatic relations between the four nations laying claim to the Caribbean. Relations may differ greatly from game to game, and can shift in an instant, creating and removing opportunities, possibly even for long periods of time. The player generally benefits from periods of war between two or more countries, because any aggression towards a country&#x27;s ships or cities, which occurs often if not specifically avoided, will gain recognition with its enemies, prompting them to bestow the player with land, titles, and other benefits. During peacetime, the player can only benefit from the capture of pirates on the high seas, which is seen as favorable by all nations, but is a rare occurrence.

Cities are also dynamic, with statistics like wealth and population fluctuating constantly. The player can access any city&#x27;s statistics. Knowing the statistics of a city helps the player plan ahead, especially with regards to trading or any desire to raid or conquer cities.

The original versions of &quot;Pirates!&quot; sported both disk and manual copy protections. Users were asked the time at which various treasure ships were arriving at the port. If the time was wrong, the game would continue, but at a much higher difficulty level that would frustrate most people.

==Development==
In early 1986, Meier and fellow MicroProse designer Arnold Hendrick wanted to create a role-playing adventure game, but Meier&#x27;s business partner Bill Stealey was skeptical of producing non-vehicle simulations. With five successful years behind him, Microprose considered star designer Sid Meier a selling point and chose to put his name on the box of his next game, despite a shift away from combat simulators he had become known for. According to Stealey, the idea to add Meier&#x27;s name came after meeting Robin Williams: &quot;We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns to me and says &#x27;Bill, you should put Sid&#x27;s name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.

Meier in his interview said that &quot;&quot;Pirates!&quot; was actually inspired by a technological trick&quot; when &quot;one of our programmers came up with a cool trick where we could create images, pieces of art, by packing them into a font. And that allowed us to very quickly bring in new pictures&quot;. The game is mostly written in Commodore BASIC. Comments in the source code indicate that Meier originally intended to call it &quot;Pirates of the Spanish Main!!&quot;.

Meier admits that &quot;Pirates!&quot; was not intended to provide an authentic, true-to-life recreation of historical piracy: &quot;&quot;Pirates!&quot; was designed more around your fantasy of pirates than the actual reality. That allowed you to bring in all the stuff from the movies, whatever you had read, whatever was in your imagination&quot;. MicroProse planned several game elements removed before release, including multiple NPCs per town, more detailed sailing including fleet actions, and a subplot involving religion and nobility.

==Ports==
The game was widely ported from the original Commodore 64 version, first to the Apple II (1987), then later to IBM PC compatibles (1987), Apple IIGS (1988), Macintosh (1988), Amstrad CPC (1988), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1990), and Nintendo Entertainment System (1991). The NES port was developed by Rare and published by Ultra Games. Tobacco is replaced as a trade item by &quot;crops&quot; because of Nintendo&#x27;s family-friendly requirements.

The IBM PC version was originally released in 1987 as a self-booting disk, stored on either two 5¼-inch disks or a single 3½-inch disk. A version for MS-DOS compatible operating systems was released in 1994 on CD-ROM in Europe, edited by Kixx.

==Reception==
&quot;Pirates!&quot; was a groundbreaking game in its era. Its puzzles appealed more to female gamers than previous products from MicroProse, a company known for military simulations like &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle&quot;. Although other open-ended games had already been released, the style of player-directed gameplay in &quot;Pirates!&quot; led it to be the spiritual predecessor of countless others since, both by Sid Meier himself (&quot;Civilization&quot;, &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot;) and many others.

&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; in 1987 praised the detailed gameplay with arcade and strategic aspects, stating that &quot;the designers of &quot;Pirates!&quot; set themselves a variety of ambitious goals and succeeded on every count&quot;. The magazine concluded that the game &quot;is a real treasure&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that although reminiscent of &quot;The Seven Cities of Gold&quot; or &quot;Broadsides&quot;, &quot;Pirates will prove to be a design with fresh approaches and much historical depth ... intriguing and addicting&quot;. Matthew J. Costello for &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; said that &quot;[Arnold] Hendrick seemed to have helped supply the indefinable quality of fun and purpose that fills Pirates!. It’s not just a game of battles, plunder, and divvying up the loot.&quot; The game was reviewed in 1988 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave &quot;Pirates!&quot; five stars out of five in a 1990 survey of historical strategy and war games, and four stars in a 1993 survey of pre 20th-century strategy games, calling it &quot;a genre breakthrough, this is a fascinating simulation of the Age of Piracy&quot;. &quot;The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review&quot; noted excellent manual, educational and historical aspects. Orson Scott Card wrote in &quot;Compute!&quot; in 1989 that &quot;Pirates&quot;″ use of an unusually strict copy protection was understandable because &quot;the game is so good that even people who drive 55 mph might consider stealing it&quot;. He said that &quot;Pirates!&quot; seemed misleadingly easy, with players discovering non-obvious nuances to the gameplay.

&quot;Pirates!&quot; won many awards, including &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s &quot;Action Game of the Year&quot; for 1988, and two Origins Awards: &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1987&quot; and &quot;Best Screen Graphics in a Home Computer Game of 1987&quot;. In 1989, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named &quot;Pirates!&quot; to its Hall of Fame for games readers rated highly over time, with a score of 9.7 out of 12, and &quot;Compute!&quot; gave it the Compute! Choice Award for Historical Game. In 1990 &quot;Pirates!&quot; received the tenth-highest number of votes in a survey of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; readers&#x27; &quot;All-Time Favorites&quot;. In 1996, the magazine ranked it as the 18th best video game of all time, noting that the Amiga version was by far the best by then. In 2004, readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; voted &quot;Pirates!&quot; the 84th top retro game, with the staff noting that &quot;people still play the original version, even though Sid Meier himself produced later versions&quot;. In 2005, IGN rated it as the sixth greatest video game of all time. In 2011, Polish web portal Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the fifth most addictive classic game &quot;that stole our childhood&quot;. In 2006, abandonware website &quot;Abandonia&quot;″s Sebatianos reviewed &quot;Pirates!&quot;, who was impressed with graphics and sounds.

==Legacy==
&quot;Pirates!&quot;″ success resulted in the similar &quot;Sword of the Samurai&quot;. The &quot;Pirates! Gold&quot; remake was released for Windows 3.1x, DOS compatible operating systems, Macintosh, and Sega Genesis in 1993. It was also released on CD for the CD32 in 1994 with enhanced CD audio tracks. Sun sighting was not present in this version, and there were no special items. The game added several new features, such as extra missions assigned to the player by governors. The MS-DOS version includes VGA graphics, a MIDI score, mouse support, and a copy protection scheme requiring the player to identify the flag of a pirate ship sighted on the horizon.

An enhanced remake published in 2004, also entitled &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot;, was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, Xbox 360, Mac OS X, Wii, and PSP.

&quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates! Mobile&quot; was developed by Oasys Mobile in 2008. Mobile versions were later released for BlackBerry (2010) and Apple&#x27;s iPad (2011). A version for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch was released in April 2012, published by 2K Games. In addition, the game was ported over to the Windows Phone 7 on 9 April 2012.

In 2013, Tommo purchased the rights to the game and began digitally publishing it through its Retroism brand.

<text>Pelham Bay Park is a municipal park located in the northeast corner of the New York City borough of the Bronx. It is, at , the largest public park in New York City. The park is more than three times the size of Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park. The park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks).

Pelham Bay Park contains many geographical features, both natural and man-made. The park includes several peninsulas, including Rodman&#x27;s Neck, Tallapoosa Point, and the former Hunter and Twin Islands. A lagoon runs through the center of Pelham Bay Park, and Eastchester Bay splits the southwestern corner from the rest of the park. There are also several recreational areas within the park. Orchard Beach runs along Pelham Bay on the park&#x27;s eastern shore. Two golf courses and various nature trails are located within the park&#x27;s central section. Other landmarks include the Bartow-Pell Mansion, a city landmark, as well as the Bronx Victory Column &amp; Memorial Grove.

Before its creation, the land comprising the current Pelham Bay Park was part of Anne Hutchinson&#x27;s short-lived dissident colony. Part of New Netherland, it was destroyed in 1643 by a Siwanoy attack in reprisal for the unrelated massacres carried out under Willem Kieft&#x27;s direction of the Dutch West India Company&#x27;s New Amsterdam colony. In 1654 an Englishman named Thomas Pell purchased from the Siwanoy, land which would become known as Pelham Manor after Charles II&#x27;s 1666 charter. During the American Revolutionary War, the land was a buffer between British-held New York City and rebel-held Westchester, serving as the site of the Battle of Pell&#x27;s Point, where Massachusetts militia hiding behind stone walls (still visible at one of the park&#x27;s golf courses) stopped a British advance.

The park was created in 1888, under the auspices of the Bronx Parks Department, largely inspired by the vision of John Mullaly, and passed to New York City when the part of the Bronx east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895. Orchard Beach, one of the city&#x27;s most popular, was created through the efforts of Robert Moses in the 1930s.

==History==
=== Pre-colonial times ===
Before the colonization of what is now New York State in the 17th century, Pelham Bay Park comprised an archipelago of islands separated by salt marshes and peninsular beaches. Geologically, most of the park&#x27;s land first formed during the end of the last ice age, the Wisconsin glaciation, which occurred 10,000 to 15,000 years before the first colonists arrived. The melting of the glaciers caused the formation of the current marshes. Sea level rise from the melting glaciers caused sedimentation along the shore, creating sand and mud flats. Gradually, saltwater cordgrass started to retain sediment, causing some of the inland marshes to flood only during high tide.

The Siwanoy (transliterated as &quot;southern people&quot;) were the first Native American tribe to inhabit the Long Island Sound&#x27;s northern shoreline east to Connecticut. They lived a mostly hunter-gatherer existence. The Siwanoy used the modern-day park site as a ceremonial and burial site, as evidenced by the wampum belts found in the area, which were used for diplomatic purposes among local Native American tribes. Two glacial erratics in the park, deposited during the end of the last ice age, were used ceremonially by the Siwanoy: the &quot;Gray Mare&quot; on Hunter Island, and Mishow near the Theodore Kazimiroff Nature Trail.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
The Dutch West India Company purchased the land in 1639. They called it &quot;Vreedelandt&quot;, which translates to &quot;land of peace&quot;, and alternatively &quot;Oostdorp&quot;, meaning &quot;east village&quot;. &quot;Oostdorp&quot; became the area known as Westchester Square, to the southwest of the current park.

In 1642, Anne Hutchinson and her family moved from Rhode Island to Split Rock, along the Hutchinson River in what is now Pelham Bay Park. Although the family was English, the land was part of New Netherland under Dutch authority. The exact location of the Hutchinson house is unknown, with one scholar saying that the house was in the modern-day park on the east side of the Hutchinson River, and another saying that the house was on the west side of the river in now Baychester. The Siwanoy destroyed the Hutchinson settlement and killed the family in August 1643, in reprisal for the unrelated massacres carried out under Willem Kieft&#x27;s direction of the Dutch West India Company&#x27;s New Amsterdam colony.

In 1654 an Englishman named Thomas Pell purchased from the Siwanoy, comprising the land of the current Pelham Bay Park as well as the nearby town of Pelham, New York, and made his estate on of that land. The current park consists of the southernmost portion of Pell&#x27;s estate, excluding Hart Island and City Island. Pell&#x27;s land became known as Pelham Manor after Charles II&#x27;s 1666 charter, and parts of Pell&#x27;s land claim were in conflict with that of other nearby settlers. Pell died in 1669, willing his property to his nephew John, who sold off City Island in 1685. The land grant was renewed in 1687. The next year, Jacob Leisler bought of the remaining property on behalf of the Huguenots, and with that land, founded the town of New Rochelle for the Huguenots. Upon John Pell&#x27;s death in 1700, he willed the property to his son Joseph, who in turn transferred ownership to his own son, John. Ownership of the manor then went to the Bartow family, who were maternal descendants of the Pell family. The Pell family burial plot faced the Pelham Bay waterfront on the eastern side of the manor.

The land was the site of the Battle of Pell&#x27;s Point during the American Revolutionary War. After the British forces unsuccessfully attempted to trap the main body of the Continental Army on the island of Manhattan, British Army commander-in-chief General Sir William Howe looked for another location along Long Island Sound to disembark his troops. On October 18, 1776, he landed 4,000 men at Pelham, close to the current park. A brigade of 750 men under the command of the American Colonel John Glover were already inland, and they attacked the British advance units from behind a series of stone walls. After a series of attacks, the British broke off, and the Americans retreated.

In 1836, Robert Bartow, a descendant of Thomas Pell, bought of his ancestor&#x27;s old estate. By 1842, construction was complete on the Bartow-Pell Mansion, the family&#x27;s manor. Bartow died in 1868, and his family sold the mansion to the city in the 1880s. The mansion was vacant until 1915, when the city and International Garden Club assumed joint maintenance of the building.

=== 1870s and 1880s: Creation ===
In the 1870s, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned a greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan. Around the same time, &quot;New York Herald&quot; editor John Mullaly pushed for the creation of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families&#x27; properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. There were objections to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the site. However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature&#x27;s lower house). In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of the park system.

Legal disputes carried on for years. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure, and that everyone in the city would need to pay taxes to pay for the parks&#x27; construction, regardless of whether they lived near the parks. In particular, Pelham Bay Park was located within Westchester County at the time, out of city limits. The city was reluctant to pay to buy the parkland because of the cost and locations. Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city&#x27;s citizens; that the value of properties near the parks would appreciate greatly over time; that the Pelham Bay Park site could easily be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established, owing to efforts from supporters.

After much litigation, the city acquired the land for the park. Although the residents of Pelham had initially supported the park&#x27;s creation, they came to oppose it when they found that the park&#x27;s creation would decrease the town&#x27;s tax revenue. The 1,700 acres of land for the park were part of the town&#x27;s area at that time, but could not be taxed, nearly halving the town&#x27;s tax revenues from land area. One Pelham resident&#x27;s letter to New York City Mayor Abram Hewitt, asking for financial assistance to supplement the town&#x27;s growing tax rate, was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in February 1887. A month later, a group of Pelham residents petitioned Hewitt to oppose the park plan. The government of New York City also did not want to pay taxes to the town of Pelham if it bought the land for the park, which had been one of the reasons for its initial opposition to acquiring the land. There was a proposal to have New York City pay taxes to Pelham if it acquired the land, which the city&#x27;s Tax Department called &quot;entirely novel, and of course, wrong&quot;.

Despite Pelham residents&#x27; opposition to the park, the city acquired the land for Pelham Bay Park in 1887, and it officially became a park in 1888. Pelham Bay Park became a recreation area under the auspices of the Bronx Parks Department, which bought the land for $2,746,688, . The park used land from multiple estates spread out over an excess of . Some of the old estates&#x27; mansions were still standing twenty years later. To alleviate the concerns of Westchester property owners who lost land during the park system&#x27;s acquisition, the New York City Commissioners of Estimate distributed compensation payments. The Commissioners of Estimate paid a combined $9 million (), but some land owners sued for more compensation in 1889.

===1890s to 1920s: Early years===
In 1890, Mullaly proposed using the site for the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair due to its size; however, the fair was eventually awarded to Chicago instead. The Pell family&#x27;s burial vault was also marked for preservation that year, and in July 1891, the descendants of the Pell family were given permission to maintain and restore the plot. After the park opened, several individuals were allowed to reside in the mansions within the park. In 1892, the New York City Department of Public Parks separately allowed the occupation of the Hunter, Hoyt, and Twin Island houses. The next year, two buildings near Pelham Bridge were auctioned off.

Pelham Bay Park&#x27;s ownership was passed to New York City when the part of the Bronx east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895. Despite the park being for public use, some of the old estates remained standing, with a few occupied by private families. Due to its distance from the city, NYC Parks decided to keep of Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt Parks in their natural state, unlike some of the other parks closer to Manhattan, which were being extensively landscaped. None of the houses were rented in 1899, but by 1900, thirty-six houses in the park were being used as private residences, comprising 75% of houses rented within parks in the Bronx. This number dropped to thirty-three the next year.

In spring 1902, NYC Parks destroyed two houses in the park and used the remaining wood to build free bathhouses, which were used by about 700 bathers per day during that summer. Around 1903, Hunter Island became a popular summer vacation destination. Due to overcrowding on Hunter Island, NYC Parks opened a campsite two years later at Rodman&#x27;s Neck on the south tip of the island, with 100 bathhouses. Orchard Beach, at the time a tiny recreational area on the northeast tip of Rodman&#x27;s Neck, was expanded that year. In 1904, an athletic field was opened within Pelham Bay Park.

By 1917, Hunter Island saw half a million seasonal visitors. Orchard Beach also became popular, with an average of 2,000 visitors on summer weekdays and 5,000 visitors on summer weekends in 1912. However, the park&#x27;s condition started to decline in the 1920s as the surrounding areas were developed. The park facilities were dirty and deteriorating due to overuse, and there was a lot of vandalism. Hunter Island was closed and camping was banned, so some park patrons began camping illegally.

=== 1930s–1960s: Moses renovation projects ===
The current Orchard Beach recreational area and Split Rock golf course was created through the efforts of New York City park commissioner Robert Moses. Immediately after assuming his position in 1934, Moses ordered engineers to inventory every park in the city to see what needed renovating. He devised plans for a new Orchard Beach recreation area after he saw the popularity of the Hunter Island campsite. On February 11, 1934, Moses announced a plan for the new golf course. Two weeks later, he announced another plan for the upgraded beach, which had been inspired by the design of Jones Beach on Long Island. The beach and existing golf course would be reconstructed through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) under the 1930s New Deal program.

Moses canceled 625 leases for the project, and after campers unsuccessfully sued the city, the site was cleared of campers in June. Moses decided to connect Hunter Island and the Twin Islands to Rodman&#x27;s Neck by filling in most of LeRoy&#x27;s Bay. The deteriorated Hunter Mansion was demolished with the construction of the beach. The golf courses were reopened in June 1935, sixteen months after construction commenced. John van Kleek designed the brand-new Split Rock golf course as part of the city&#x27;s program to upgrade or build ten golf courses around the city.

A final design for the beach was unveiled in July 1935. The beach project involved filling in approximately of LeRoy&#x27;s and Pelham Bays with landfill, followed by a total of of sand. Moses thought that waste from the New York City Department of Sanitation would be cheaper than sand. In early 1935, workers began placing the garbage fill around Rodman&#x27;s Neck, Twin Island, and Hunter Island. After the garbage began washing onto the beach, the rest of the site was filled-in using sand starting in 1936. The beach, designed by Gilmore David Clarke and Aymar Embury II, was dedicated in July 1936 despite only being partially complete. The beach officially opened on June 25, 1937. Soon after Orchard Beach opened, it was expanded, starting with the southern locker room in 1939. The water between Hunter and Twin Islands was filled in during 1946 and 1947, with new jetties at each end of the beach. The promenade was extended over the fill and opened in 1947, Further improvements were made to the bathhouse pavilion in 1952 and to the northern jetty in 1955. A new concession stand was added north of the pavilion in 1962, and a privately funded Golf driving range was also added that year. The beach was renovated starting in 1964.

In 1959, after the Rodman&#x27;s Neck section of the park had been used for various purposes, the New York City Police Department used land from the park to create the Rodman&#x27;s Neck Firing Range at the southern tip of the peninsula. Previously, the parkland at Rodman&#x27;s Neck had been underused, with the NYPD and United States Army using the land at various times.

=== 1960s-present: Cleanup and restoration ===

The City began landfill operations on Tallapoosa Point in Pelham Bay Park in 1963. Plans to expand the landfills in Pelham Bay Park in 1966, which would have created the City&#x27;s second-largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten Island, were met with widespread community opposition. The landfill expansion was seen as a way to alleviate the city&#x27;s accumulations of waste, and Tallapoosa was seen as the only suitable location to put the landfill. The preservation effort was headed by Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff, a Bronx historian and head of The Bronx County Historical Society. It suffered setbacks in August 1967 when the New York City Board of Estimate voted against an initial effort to create to protected area in the proposed landfill expansion site. However, the state and federal governments did not favor the landfill being located at Tallapoosa. In October, Mayor John Lindsay signed a law authorizing in the creation of two wildlife refuges, the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, on the site where the landfill was planned to be expanded. Tallapoosa West continued to be used as a landfill until May 1968, when the landfill permit was revoked. In November of that year, Tallapoosa West was made a part of the Pell refuge. The dump was still operating as late as 1975, when the garbage there was described as being ten stories high. The landfill closed in 1978. However, a report published in 1983 claimed that the Tallapoosa landfill, as well as five others throughout the city, was heavily contaminated with &quot;toxic wastes&quot; dumped from 1964 to 1979. The waste from the landfill reportedly led to health problems for residents of nearby communities such as Country Club. The Tallapoosa landfill at Pelham Bay Park was designated a hazardous-waste site in 1988, and cleanup began in 1989.

In 1983, the Theodore Kazimiroff Environmental Center was proposed for the park, alongside a nature trail that would wind through the park&#x27;s terrain. It would be named out of respect to the late historian, who had died in 1980. The Kazimiroff Nature Trail and the Pelham Bay Park Environmental Center opened in June 1986. A $1 million renovation of the Orchard Beach pavilions () was completed by 1986. By the end of the decade, large numbers of human and animal remains were being dumped in Pelham Bay Park, including 65 human bodies that were dumped in the park from 1986 to 1995. Pelham Bay Park was also very dirty, and discarded trash from several decades prior was still visible. NYPD officers on these cases theorized that the frequency of body dumpings might be attributable to two things: the park&#x27;s remote location near highways, as well as a belief that the parkland is haunted by the remains of the Siwanoy buried there.

In 1990, NYC Parks received a $6.3 million gift for improvements to Pelham Bay Park and twenty other parks around the city. NYC Parks used the money to renovate trails and clean up weeds. A renovation of Orchard Beach started in 1995. A water park for the beach was proposed, but ultimately canceled in 1999. A few years later, as part of the city&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, several facilities in Pelham Bay Park were proposed for upgrades. The new facilities would have included a shooting center at Rodman&#x27;s Neck; a horseback riding track; and a fencing, swimming, and water polo facility in the Orchard Beach pavilion. The bid ultimately was awarded to London instead.

In 2010, construction began on extending the jetty at Orchard Beach at a cost of $13 million. Soon after, work started on a $2.9 million project to restore Pelham Bay Park&#x27;s shoreline, which entailed renovating the seawall, adding a dog run, and creating a new walking trail. In 2012, Native American shell middens were found at Tallapoosa Point, prompting an archaeological investigation. Further digs at the site uncovered more than a hundred artifacts, some of which dated to the third century CE. Work on the restoration project was paused in June 2015 as a result of the finds. The restoration project was restarted in September 2015.

==Geography==
At , Pelham Bay Park is the city&#x27;s largest, being slightly more than three times the size of the Central Park. Pelham Bay Park includes of shoreline as well as land on both sides of the Hutchinson River. Hunter Island, Twin Island, and Two-Trees Island, all formerly true islands in Pelham Bay, are now connected to the mainland by fill, and are part of the park. Several islands in the Long Island Sound (including the Chimney Sweeps Islands), as well as Goose Island in the Hutchinson River, are also part of Pelham Bay Park. The park is divided into several sections, including two main sections roughly divided by Eastchester Bay.

In the eastern section of Pelham Bay Park is Orchard Beach and its parking lot. The eastern section also contains the Hunter Island Wildlife Sanctuary on Twin and Hunter Islands. The Kazimiroff Nature Trail winds through this section. The northwestern section, divided from the eastern section via the Lagoon. It contains both golf courses, as well as the Thomas Pell Sanctuary; the Bartow-Pell Woods; Goose Creek Marsh; and the Siwanoy, Bridle, and Split Rock Trails. The park is crossed by Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor railroad at this location, as well as by the Hutchinson River Parkway and New England Thruway. A central section contains a Central Woodland, where the Siwanoy Trail and Turtle Cove Driving Range is present. It also includes Rodman&#x27;s Neck as well as a portion of the park known as &quot;The Meadow&quot;. The Pelham Bridge carries traffic across the Eastchester Bay between the southwest section and the rest of the park.

The park contains many different habitats. The largest habitat is the forests, followed by the salt marshes, the salt flats, the meadows, the mixed scrub, and the fresh water marsh. In total, about 67% of the park is estimated to be in its natural state, while 33% of the park is estimated to be developed. In the latter half of the 20th century, Pelham Bay Park&#x27;s biodiversity decreased: in that time, the park was observed to have lost 25% of its 569 native species of plants as well as 12.5% of its 321 non-native species.

===Land features===
====Hunter Island====
Hunter Island () is a peninsula filled with woodlands; it had previously been until Robert Moses extended Orchard Beach in the 1930s. A former island, it was part of the Pelham Islands, the historical name for a group of islands in western Long Island Sound that once belonged to Thomas Pell. The Siwanoy referred to the island as &quot;Laap-Ha-Wach King&quot;, or &quot;place of stringing beads&quot;. The island was then renamed after John Hunter, a successful businessman and politician, who purchased the property in 1804 and moved his family to the island in 1813. They built a mansion in the English Georgian style at the highest point on the island (90 feet above sea level). The mansion was destroyed in 1937 during the construction of Orchard Beach. In 1967, the island became part of the Hunter Island Wildlife Sanctuary.

====Twin Island====
Twin Island, at , is wooded with exposed bedrock with glacial grooves. The East and West Twin Islands (or the &quot;Twins&quot;) were once true islands in Pelham Bay but are now connected to each other and to Orchard Beach and nearby Rodman&#x27;s Neck by a landfill created in 1937. East Twin Island, a rocky formation with &quot;ribbons of color&quot; caused by sedimentary erosion, is connected to neighboring Two Trees Island via a thin mudflat land bridge. Two Trees Island itself consists of a rocky plateau upon which one can see Orchard Beach and the environmental center. West Twin Island was at one time connected to neighboring Hunter Island via a man-made stone bridge, which now lies in ruins in one of the city&#x27;s last remaining salt marshes.

The two islands that are now combined as Twin Island have been owned by NYC Parks since the 1888 acquisition of Pelham Bay Park. A tennis court was built on the island in 1899. Twin Island was restored in 1995 as part of the Twin Islands Salt Marsh Restoration Project, which cost $850,000.

====Rodman&#x27;s Neck====

Rodman&#x27;s Neck is a peninsula located in the central section of the park (at ). The southern third of the peninsula is used as a firing range by the New York City Police Department (NYPD); the remaining wooded section is part of Pelham Bay Park. The north side, which is joined to the rest of Pelham Bay Park near Orchard Beach, contains several baseball fields. Two small land berms between Rodman&#x27;s Neck and City Island consist of the island&#x27;s only connecting road to the mainland.

Rodman&#x27;s Neck was part of the historic Pell property, and since the city acquired the peninsula in 1888, it has been used for multiple purposes. It was used as a United States Army training location during World War I, and was converted to under-utilized parkland in the 1920s. From 1930 to 1936, the peninsula was incorporated as part of Camp Mulrooney, a summer camp for the NYPD. The Army used Rodman&#x27;s Neck again in the 1950s during the Cold War. and the NYPD built the current firing range at the peninsula&#x27;s southern tip in 1959.

====Tallapoosa Point====
Tallapoosa Point is located in the southwest of Pelham Bay Park, near the Pelham Bridge. It used to be a separate island south of Eastchester Bay, having been private property, but was connected to the mainland during the colonial period. The point then became a popular fishing spot. In 1879, the Tallapoosa Club political group started leasing part of the peninsula from the city during the summer, hosting activities there. The club&#x27;s presence gave the peninsula its current name, and in turn, the club&#x27;s name was derived from Tallapoosa, Georgia, where some of its members had fought during the American Civil War. The Tallapoosa Club used a mansion originally built by the Lorillard family. They used the mansion until October 1, 1895.

Tallapoosa Point was used as a dump from 1963 until 1968, when landfill operations ceased and it became a part of the Wildlife Refuge. Since then it has been a part of the park, but there was an obscure proposal in the 1970s to make Tallapoosa into a ski slope. Tallapoosa Point was later re-planted and serves as a bird habitat.

===Waterways===
====Pelham Bay====

Between City Island and Orchard Beach is a sound named Pelham Bay (), but contrary to its name, it is not a bay, but rather a sound since it is open to larger bodies of water at both ends. It connects to Eastchester Bay at the south, and opens onto Long Island Sound and City Island Harbor at the east. Approximately one third of the original bay was filled in to create Orchard Beach from 1934 to 1938.

====Eastchester Bay====

Eastchester Bay is a body of water that separates City Island and most of the park from the park&#x27;s southwest portion and the rest of the Bronx. It is crossed by the Pelham Bridge, which connects the two parts of the park. It is technically also a sound, and the northern end connects via a narrow channel to Pelham Bay. The Hutchinson River empties into Eastchester Bay near the northern end. The lower portion of the bay opens onto the East River, Little Neck Bay, and Long Island Sound.

====Lagoon====
A lagoon within the park was once part of Pelham Bay, separating Hunter and Twin Islands from the mainland, and was called LeRoy&#x27;s Bay until the mid-20th century. It was popular for rowing regattas, but could not be used for regulation rowing races as it was blocked by the causeway to Hunter Island. By 1902, there were calls to remove the causeway so LeRoy&#x27;s Bay could be used as a raceway. The New York City Department of Public Parks decided to create a &quot;temporary&quot; wooden bridge and remove the causeway to allow the bay&#x27;s tides to flow freely.

Most of the lagoon was filled in during the mid-1930s reconstruction of Orchard Beach, and the bay became known as the &quot;Orchard Beach Lagoon&quot;, or the Lagoon for short. The lagoon between Orchard Beach and the Westchester border had been popular for regattas, or boat races, for decades, but it was neglected through the 1940s and 1950s. Rocks, weeds, and unwanted cars were tossed into the lagoon regularly.

The lagoon was chosen as the site of the 1964 Summer Olympics rowing trials, at which point it was widened and dredged, becoming a four-lane, rowing track. The track, which cost $630,000, was hosted jointly by the city and the organizers of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. New York City hosted several of the 1964 Olympic trials at various locations as part of the World&#x27;s Fair the same year. Afterward, the now-unnamed lagoon was used by New York-area colleges for boating regattas, since it had been determined to be one of the most suitable locations for boat racing in the United States. Multiple colleges, including Columbia, Manhattan, St. John&#x27;s, Fordham, Iona, and Yale, utilized the lagoon for collegiate rowing practice.

====Turtle Cove====
Turtle Cove is a small cove along the north side of City Island Road west of Orchard Beach Road. Around the early 1900s, a land berm was created across Turtle Cove for rails for horsecars. This berm caused the north end of Turtle Cove to become mostly freshwater, which attracted freshwater drinking rare birds in the meadow. A diameter concrete culvert was placed across the berm to allow salt water from Eastchester Bay, but leaves and vegetation blocked this culvert. Starting in June 2009, NYC Parks started a restoration project for the cove, removing the old culvert and digging a canal to flood the north end of the cove with salt water. NYC Parks then placed a foot bridge across the canal. Some of forest were also restored, with 10,000 trees being replaced. The cove also contains a batting cage and a golf center with miniature golf, PGA simulators, and grass tees.

===Notable natural features===
====Glover&#x27;s Rock====

Glover&#x27;s Rock (), a giant granite glacial erratic, has a bronze plaque commemorating the Battle of Pell&#x27;s Point. However, contrary to popular belief, the rock had nothing to do with the battle. In their respective books, Henry B. Dawson (1886) and William Abbatt (1901) both wrote that Colonel John Glover reputedly stood on the rock and watched the British forces land during the battle. This claim is erroneous, as these distances were computed based on an inaccurate map using estimates recorded by Glover in his &quot;Letter from Mile Square&quot; on October 24, 1776. The actual location where Glover watched British forces land is closer to the second tee of the current Split Rock Golf Course. The rock is only known as such today because Abbatt includes a labeled photograph of it in his book.

====Split Rock====
Split Rock (), a large dome-shaped granite boulder measuring approximately from north to south and from east to west, is located at the intersection of the New England Thruway and Hutchinson River Parkway, on a triangular parcel of land formed by these roads and a ramp that leads from the northbound Parkway to the northbound Thruway. The only public access to the rock is by a pedestrian trail that begins on Eastchester Place, outside the park. The Bridle Trail passes close to the rock, but is separated from the rock by the parkway&#x27;s exit ramp. Another park trail, called the Split Rock Trail, leads from the Bartow Circle to the rock.

The Split Rock Golf Course was named after the rock. Split Rock also gives its name to Split Rock Road in Pelham Manor, which used to extend into the park itself. The rock appears to be a glacial erratic and derives its name from a large crevice dividing the stone into two half domes. The huge rock broke in half about 10,000 years ago under the stress of glacial movements.

Split Rock is also the location near where, in 1643, Anne Hutchinson and members of her family were massacred by Native Americans of the Siwanoy Tribe. Her daughter, Susanna, the only member of the family to survive the massacre, was at the rock during the time of the attack, which took place at the house, a distance away. In 1904, the New York State Legislature approved the placement of a bronze tablet on Split Rock in honor of Anne Hutchinson. The tablet was installed in 1911 by the Colonial Dames of New York. However, it was stolen in 1914. The plaque reads:

ANNE HUTCHINSON

Banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638

Because of her Devotion to Religious Liberty This Courageous Woman

Sought Freedom from Persecution in New Netherland

Near this Rock in 1643 She and her Household

were Massacred by Indians

This Tablet is placed here by the Colonial Dames of the State of New York

ANNO DOMINI MCMXI Virtutes Majorum Filiae Conservant
The boulder is of enough historic importance that in the 1950s, Theodore Kazimiroff of the Bronx Historical Society convinced officials to move the planned Interstate 95 (New England Thruway) a few feet north to save Split Rock from being dynamited.

====Treaty Oak====

Treaty Oak () is located on the Pell estate near the Bartow-Pell Mansion. A treaty was reportedly signed under this oak tree in 1654 between Siwanoy Chief Wampage and colonist Thomas Pell, in which Pell purchased all land east of the Bronx River in what was then Westchester County, New York. The Society of the Daughters of the Revolution erected a protective fence and a plaque near the tree, but it was destroyed by lightning in 1906 and toppled in a storm in March 1909. Parts of the original tree were donated to museums and historical societies.

A replacement tree was planted in 1915, and the current tree at the location is an elm.

=== Wildlife sanctuaries ===
Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary consist of a total of of marshes and forests within Pelham Bay Park. They were created in 1967 as a result to opposition to a planned landfill on the site of the current sanctuaries. Much of the forests in these sanctuaries are estimated to be at least three centuries old, dating to colonial times. The park also has two nature centers at Orchard Beach and in the southwestern section of the park.

====Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary====
The Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary, named for Thomas Pell, makes up the westerly part of Pelham Bay Park. Included within its bounds are Goose Creek Marsh, which once formed part of a wetland that covered what is now Co-op City and the southern part of Pelham Bay Park, as well as the saltwater wetlands adjoining the Hutchinson River. The sanctuary also includes Goose Island, Split Rock, and the oak–hickory forests in tidal marshes bordering the Split Rock Golf Course. The area is home to a variety of wildlife including raccoon, egrets, hawks, and coyotes.

====Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary====
Located north of Orchard Beach, the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary encompasses all of Twin Islands, Cat Briar Island, Two Trees Island, and the northeastern shoreline of Hunter Island. It contains many glacial erratics, large boulders that were deposited during the last ice age, as well as the largest continuous oak forest in Pelham Bay Park. The sanctuary supports a unique intertidal marine ecosystem that is rare in New York State.

===Wildlife-related activities===

The park is a popular spot for bird watching, with up to 264 species having been spotted. Common bird species observed within the park include great horned owl, northern saw-whet owl, barn owl, red-tailed hawk, and warblers on Hunter Island; American woodcock, willow flycatcher, northern harrier, woodpeckers, black-capped chickadee, tufted titmouse, and white-breasted nuthatch in the meadow west of Orchard Beach; and various songbirds and sparrows north of the Pelham Bay Golf Course. Birds in the park&#x27;s waters include loons, grebes, cormorants, anseriformes, and gulls from the Twin Island coasts; greater yellowlegs, lesser yellowlegs, loons, hooded merganser, Canada goose, mallard, and egrets in Eastchester Bay and Turtle Cove; and osprey and waterbirds in the lagoon. This is a result of Pelham Bay Park&#x27;s location within one of the major seasonal bird migration corridors. The National Audubon Society has designated the park as one of four &quot;Important Bird Areas&quot; within the city.

Saltwater fishing is also popular within the park, but is prohibited on Orchard Beach when the beach is open during the summer. There are two major areas where fishing is allowed: in the southern part of Pelham Bay Park near Eastchester Bay; and in the northern part near the Lagoon, Turtle Cove, and northern beach jetty.

South of Orchard Beach is a meadow that hosts the only known population of the moth species &quot;Amphipoea erepta ryensis&quot;. Another population used to exist in Rye, Westchester County.

=== Surroundings ===
Pelham Bay Park is bounded by the town of Pelham, New York, to the north; City Island and Long Island Sound to the east; Watt Avenue and Bruckner Expressway to the south; and the Hutchinson River Parkway to the west.

North of the park is the village of Pelham Manor in Westchester County, and a strip of land that is part of New York City due to a boundary error. Owners of the several dozen houses on the strip have a Pelham Manor zip code and phone numbers and their children attend Pelham public schools, but as Bronx residents pay much lower property taxes than their Westchester County neighbors.

To the southeast, the City Island Bridge connects the park to City Island.

==Landmarks, attractions, and recreational features==
===Orchard Beach===

Orchard Beach (), a public beach, is part of Pelham Bay Park and comprises the borough&#x27;s only beach. The , beach faces the Long Island Sound and is laid out in a crescent shape with a width of during high tide. An icon of the Bronx, Orchard Beach is sometimes called the Bronx Riviera, the Riviera of New York City, Hood Beach, or the Working Class Riviera. It contains a set of twin pavilions, which were both landmarked by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2006.

=== Bronx Victory Column &amp; Memorial Grove ===
The Bronx Victory Column &amp; Memorial Grove is a limestone column that supports a bronze statue of Winged Victory on Crimi Road in the park. The grove of trees that surround the statue were originally planted on the Grand Concourse in 1921 by the American Legion; they were removed in 1928 when construction began on the IND Concourse Line (). In 1930, the American Legion revealed plans to relocate the grove to Pelham Bay Park, where there would be a new monument to honor Bronx servicemen. The monument was designed by John J. Sheridan and sculpted by Belle Kinney and Leopold Scholz. On September 24, 1933, the monument and grove was dedicated to the 947 Bronxites who died in World War I. The column is supported by a pedestal. The statue itself is 18 feet tall and , located atop a series of 14 discs. This brings the monument&#x27;s aggregate height to more than . While officially a memorial to servicemen from the Bronx, it is also a favorite location for wedding photography.

=== Bartow-Pell Mansion ===
A 19th-century plantation-style mansion called the Bartow–Pell Mansion (located at ) is a colonial remnant done in Greek revival style. The mansion, originally built in 1842, was sold to the city in 1880, which maintained it until 1914, when the city and International Garden Club assumed joint maintenance of the building. Since 1975, it has been a National Historic Landmark.

=== Pelham Bay and Split Rock Golf Courses ===

The Pelham Bay Golf Course opened in 1901, followed by the Split Rock Golf Course in 1935. The courses, consisting of eighteen holes each, share an Art Deco clubhouse (located at ). The courses are separated by the Northeast Corridor railroad tracks, with the Split Rock course to the northwest and the Pelham Bay course to the southeast.

Plans for a golf course in Pelham Bay Park have existed since soon after the park was founded. In 1899, the New York Athletic Club approached Lawrence Van Etten, an architect renowned for designing golf courses, for a request to construct an 18-hole course within the park. The proposed course would be bounded by Pelham Manor to the north; the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad (now Northeast Corridor) tracks to the west; and Shore Road to the southeast. The city was building Van Cortlandt Park&#x27;s golf course at the time, but the Bronx district parks commissioner approved Van Etten&#x27;s plan. Originally, the club wanted to construct a park on Hunter Island, but Van Etten felt that the island was too small for a full 18-hole course. Once the Van Cortlandt Park course was opened, city officials started focusing on plans for the Pelham course.

In April 1900, surveyors began studying part of the park as a possible location for a golf course. Later that month, workers began construction at the northwest course location. It was expected that the course would open in June or July of that year, but that the work would not be fully complete until September. New York City greenskeeper Val Flood later stated that he thought the course would open by August; however, by September 1900, work on the course had hardly started due to a lack of workers. By the end of 1900, NYC Parks reported that seeds had been planted for nine greens, and two bunkers and one hazard had been created. The course opened in 1901, but did not gain popularity until 1903 when overcrowding at the Van Cortlandt course drove players to use the less crowded Pelham Bay course instead.

In 1934, a new 18-hole course was announced for the north side of the park, along with a renovation to the Pelham Bay course under the WPA. It was part of the rebuilding of 10 golf courses in the city. The new course brought the total number of holes in the park&#x27;s courses to 36, with each course being between between the first and last tees. This comprised two 18-hole courses or four 9-hole courses. There was also a new two-story brick Greek Revival clubhouse adjacent to both of the 18-hole courses, with a golf store, Pro Shop, cafeteria, lockers, restrooms, and showers. Construction started on the new course and clubhouse in September 1934. The new Split Rock course, based on a plan from John van Kleek, opened in 1935 along with the rebuilt Pelham Bay course.

===Bronx Equestrian Center===
The northern section of Pelham Bay Park is the home of the Bronx Equestrian Center on Shore Road, where visitors can ride horses and ponies through the parks&#x27; trails or obtain riding lessons. The Bronx Equestrian Center also provides wagon rides and hosts wedding events.

=== Southwestern section ===
The southwestern part of Pelham Bay Park contains several recreational facilities, but unlike the rest of the park, the southwestern section mainly serves the nearby neighborhoods. The southwest park&#x27;s largest point of interest is the Aileen B. Ryan Recreational Complex, which contains a running track, two baseball fields, and the Playground for All Children, a play area with special features for physically handicapped children. Another playground, the Sweetgum Playground, is located near Bruckner Boulevard. The Pelham Track and Field includes an artificial turf football field as well as long jumping. The southwest park also contains a dog run, four more baseball fields (for a total of six), two bocce courts, several basketball courts, and nine tennis courts. This section of the park also includes the Pelham Bay Nature Center. The neighborhood of Pelham Bay is across the Bruckner Expressway from this section of the park.

A long and narrow woodland called Huntington Woods, located on the southern border of this park, is named after the tract&#x27;s last owners. Archer Milton Huntington, the founder of the Hispanic Society of America, and his wife, sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, had acquired the property in 1896 after the park had been established. The city added of Huntington&#x27;s estate to the park in 1925 and annexed the remaining land in 1933.

The southwestern park also contains two monuments. &quot;American Boy&quot; was commissioned in 1923 by French sculptor Louis St. Lannes and carved from one block of Indiana Limestone. A tribute to the athletic body, it once stood outside the Rice Stadium and Recreation Building; the stadium, named and funded by the widow of Isaac Leopold Rice, stood at the site from the 1920s until 1989. The former stadium site is now the Pelham Track and Field. The other is the Bronx Victory Column &amp; Memorial Grove.

== Management ==
A nonprofit organization called Friends of Pelham Bay Park (founded in 1992) manages the park, while NYC Parks owns and operates the land and facilities. Compared to the Central Park Conservancy, Friends of Pelham Bay Park does not receive as much funding. Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park; the earliest efforts for such a thing date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.

== Transportation ==
=== Bridges ===

As part of the city&#x27;s acquisition of Pelham Bay Park in 1888, NYC Parks claimed responsibility for maintenance over the western end of the City Island Bridge, which was within the park. The City Island Bridge had been built by the 1870s. By 1892, the bridge was in need of maintenance, and a proposal for a replacement bridge was approved in 1895. The replacement bridge started construction in late 1898 and was completed in 1901.

The Pelham Bridge, which had opened in 1871 on the site of two previous bridges, was also incorporated into the park. Planning for a new bridge started in 1901, and NYC Parks transferred the responsibility for constructing the new bridge to the Department of Bridges in 1902. A new stone bridge was opened in 1908 to accommodate higher volumes of traffic.

The century-old City Island Bridge was subsequently replaced again in the 2010s. Planning for the new bridge started in 2005, though a lack of funding delayed the start of construction to 2012. The new bridge was completed in 2015, and the old one was demolished soon after.

=== Roads ===

The park is traversed by the Hutchinson River Parkway on its west side. The New England Thruway (I-95), a partial toll road, also has a short highway section in the park&#x27;s northwest corner. A partial interchange between the two roads is located within the park. To the south, an exit from the Hutchinson River Parkway provides direct access to the park, Orchard Beach, and City Island. The exit and entrance ramps lead east to the Bartow Circle, where the ramps intersect with Shore Road, which runs roughly southwest-northeast, and with Orchard Beach Road, which leads southeast to the Orchard Beach parking lot. Slightly to the southwest of Bartow Circle is the T intersection of Shore Road and City Island Road, which marks the northwest terminus of the latter road. Shore Road continues across the Pelham Bridge to the southwest corner of the park, then turns west and continues onto Pelham Parkway. Meanwhile, City Island Road continues southeast to City Island Circle, where it intersects with Park Drive, a road that connects to Orchard Beach Road in the north and Rodman&#x27;s Neck in the south. City Island Road then continues southeast across the City Island Bridge to the eponymous island.

NYC Parks assumed responsibility for the park&#x27;s roads in 1888 and gradually paved and expanded them over the following decades. An expansion of Eastern Boulevard (later Shore Road) began in 1895. In 1897, the city started extending Pelham Parkway through to Eastern Boulevard. By 1902, Eastern Boulevard was referred to as &quot;the Shore drive&quot; since it ran close to the LeRoy&#x27;s Bay shore. The same year, NYC Parks built a dirt path, which connected Glover&#x27;s Rock to Shore Road. Another dirt road to Pelham Bridge was also built, and a pedestrian path from City Island Bridge to Bartow Station was built.

The Hutchinson River Parkway in Pelham Bay Park replaced the old Split Rock Road in the park. The original roadway was an undivided, limited-access parkway, designed with gently sloping curves, stone arch bridges, and wooden lightposts. The original section included bridle paths along the right-of-way. There was also a riding academy where the public could rent horses. The parkway is named for Anne Hutchinson and her family, and passes through the part of the park near where the Hutchinsons were killed by the Siwanoy. The modern-day parkway was extended south from Westchester through Pelham Bay Park in December 1937.

The second highway through the park, the New England Thruway, opened in its entirety in October 1958, connecting the Bruckner Expressway in the south with the Connecticut Turnpike in the northeast.

=== Public transport ===

Pelham Bay Park is served by the New York City Subway at its eponymous station on the west side of the Bruckner Expressway, which is served by the . The station is part of the former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s Pelham Line. The line&#x27;s northern terminus is located at the southeast corner of Pelham Bay Park, and the IRT station there opened in December 1920. An exit from the station leads onto a pedestrian bridge that crosses the expressway and leads directly to the park.

MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27; Bx29 route and Bee-Line Bus System&#x27;s 45 route also stop at the park. The southbound Bx29 makes three stops in the park: on Bruckner Boulevard near the subway station; at the intersection of Shore Road and City Island Road; and at City Island Circle. Meanwhile, Bee-Line&#x27;s 45 route stops near Bartow-Pell Mansion. The Bx12 bus serves Orchard Beach during the summer only.

===Railroads===
The Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad was chartered in 1866, connecting the Harlem River in the south and Port Chester in the north. The railroad opened in 1873, with some portions passing through the current park. The route, a branch of the New Haven Line operated by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, contained six stations. One of these stations, called alternatively City Island or Bartow, in Pelham (now part of the park). In 1895, the railroad re-acquired some of the land from the park In 1906, ownership of the Shore Road overpass over the Harlem and Port Chester railroad line was transferred to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.

A railroad of some sort also connected City Island and Pelham Bay Park from 1887 to 1919. Originally composed of the separate Pelham Park Railroad Company and the City Island Railroad, the narrow-gauge horsecar route was operated by the former of the two companies, which ran service between the Bartow station of the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad and Brown&#x27;s Hotel on City Island. The route was complete by 1892. The IRT absorbed the two companies in 1902 and started designing its own monorail in 1908. The monorail&#x27;s first journey in July 1910 ended with the monorail toppling on its side, and although service resumed in November 1910, the monorail went into receivership in December 1911. The monorail ceased operation on April 3, 1914, and was subsequently sold to the Third Avenue Railway, which abandoned the line on August 9, 1919.

The Harlem River and Port Chester tracks were maintained by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. New stations designed by Cass Gilbert were opened in 1908, but the line&#x27;s stations were all closed by 1937, having suffered from low ridership. During the late 20th century, the old Harlem River and Port Chester tracks went through a series of ownership changes, and in 1976, Amtrak bought the tracks and integrated the route into its Northeast Corridor. The station house for the line&#x27;s Bartow station still exists, albeit as a deteriorated shell; the station&#x27;s roof burned down after it was closed. An overgrown path leads from the bridle trail to the former station site.

The city renovated the Shore Road railroad overpass in the early 2000s. Citing the 1906 deed that transferred the bridge&#x27;s maintenance to the company that owned the railroad below it, the city then filed a lawsuit to make Amtrak pay for the renovation. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Amtrak in 2013.

=== Paths ===
Bicycle paths go to all parts of the park and west to Bronx Park, east to City Island, and north to Mount Vernon. The bike trails within the park itself are of varying difficulties.

===Scenic trails===
The Kazimiroff Nature Trail, a wildlife observation trail, opened in 1986. It traverses of Hunter Island. Much of the island&#x27;s natural features are found along the trail. It was opened in 1986 and comprises two overlapping lasso-shaped paths, one slightly longer than the other.

The Siwanoy Trail consists of a trail system that originates in the Central Woodlands section of the park. Originating at City Island Road, it bears to the northeast before splitting into two spurs, one going east to the Rodman&#x27;s Neck meadow and the other going north around Bartow Circle. At the circle&#x27;s eastern side, the trail splits again. One spur goes northeast in a self-closing loop to the Bartow-Pell Mansion, and the other goes northwest to connect to Split Rock Trail before going around the Hutchinson River Parkway&#x27;s interchange with Orchard Beach Road.

Split Rock Trail originates at Bartow Circle and stretches for along the west side of the park. First designated in 1938 along the path of the former Split Rock Road, the path was renovated in summer 1987.

The park is also traversed by a bridle path. That path circumscribes both golf courses, with a spur to the Bronx Equestrian Center.

<doc id="641830" wikidata="Q212700" url="?curid=641830" title="Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)">
<text>Admiral Sir Charles John Napier (6 March 1786 – 6 November 1860) was a British naval officer whose sixty years in the Royal Navy included service in the War of 1812, the Napoleonic Wars, Syrian War and the Crimean War, and a period commanding the Portuguese navy in the Liberal Wars. An innovator concerned with the development of iron ships, and an advocate of humane reform in the Royal Navy, he was also active in politics as a Liberal Member of Parliament and was probably the naval officer most widely known to the public in the early Victorian Era.

==French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars==
He became a midshipman in 1799 aboard the 16-gun sloop , but left her in May 1800 before she was lost with all hands. He next served aboard , flagship of Sir John Borlase Warren. After this, in November 1802, he transferred to the frigate under Captain William Hoste. The following year, he moved to &quot;Égyptienne&quot; for a voyage to St Helena escorting a convoy of ships and then in the English Channel and off the coast of France. (In later years, feeling he had been badly treated as a midshipman by her captain, Charles Fleeming, Napier challenged that officer to a duel, though they were eventually reconciled by their seconds.) In 1804–5 he served briefly on &quot;Mediator&quot; before moving to off Boulogne. He was promoted lieutenant on 30 November 1805. He was appointed to , and was present in her in the West Indies at the action in which the squadron under Admiral Warren took the French &quot;Marengo&quot; (80 guns) and &quot;Belle Poule&quot; (40 guns), on 13 March 1806. After returning home with Warren, he returned to the West Indies in and having been promoted to commander on 30 November 1807, he was appointed acting commander of the brig of 16 guns, formerly the French privateer &quot;Austerlitz&quot;. In August 1808 he became captain of the brig-sloop (18 guns), and in her fought a hot action off Antigua with the French sloop &quot;Diligente&quot; (18 guns), in which his thigh was smashed by a cannonball.

In April 1809, Napier took part in the capture of the Caribbean island of Martinique, and subsequently distinguished himself in the pursuit of three escaping French ships of the line, handling the small &quot;Recruit&quot; so well that the British were able to capture the French flagship &quot;D&#x27;Hautpoul&quot;. As a result, he was promoted acting post captain and briefly given the command of the captured 74-gun ship-of-the-line.

His rank was confirmed on 22 May 1809, but he was put on half-pay, when he came home as temporary captain of the frigate escorting a convoy. While on half-pay he spent some time at the University of Edinburgh.

Napier, still on half-pay, then went to Portugal to visit his three cousins, (all colonels serving in Wellington&#x27;s army, and one of whom was Charles James Napier, the future conqueror of Sindh). He took part in the Battle of Buçaco, during which he saved his cousin Charles&#x27;s life and was himself wounded.

In 1811, he was appointed captain of the frigate (32 guns) and served in the Mediterranean Fleet under Sir Edward Pellew, disrupting enemy shipping. Among his principal exploits was the 1813 capture of the island of Ponza, which was a possible haven for corsairs. In 1813 he moved to command the frigate (36 guns), operating mainly off the French and Spanish Mediterranean coast.

==American War and the &quot;Hundred Days&quot;==
After the surrender of Napoleon and his first period of exile in 1814, Napier and his ship were transferred to the coast of North America, where the War of 1812 with the United States was still in progress, now commanded by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. In the Chesapeake Bay campaign, he took part in the August expedition up the Potomac River to Alexandria (southeast of the American national capital), Arriving several days after the Burning of Washington and the Battle of Bladensburg under Maj. Gen. Robert Ross and Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn, he was second in command to Captain James Alexander Gordon. The British squadron took 10 days to travel upriver, with many strandings and damage from a tornado/thunderstorm (after the Washington fires), but on 28 August 1814 before attempting a bombardment, they captured Fort Washington on the north shoreline which was blown up by the Americans prior to the attack. The town of Alexandria capitulated with a ransom paid and the shipping there was seized. The squadron successfully withdrew downriver with their prizes despite frequent harassing American attacks from the shores downstream. During this withdrawal Napier was wounded in the neck.

He next distinguished himself in the following attack on the city of Baltimore by a British Army accompanied by 16 warships, 12–14 September 1814, under Admirals Cochrane, and Cockburn. HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; was involved in the bombardment of Fort McHenry, protecting the city on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River that began early in the morning of the 13th. At. the same time, earlier on the 12th, Gen. Ross had been put ashore to the southeast at North Point with his regiments to attack the town from the east. He was shot in a brief skirmish just before his troops met the City Brigade regiments of the Maryland Militia under Brig. Gen. John Stricker at the Battle of North Point that afternoon. After pausing for the night to tend to the substantial wounded and now under the command of Col. Arthur Brooke, the regiments waited outside the substantial American dug-in fortifications with opposing approx. 20,000 troops and 100 artillery at old Loudenschlager&#x27;s Hill (today&#x27;s Hampstead Hill in western Patterson Park) until the naval forces were able to subdue the fort and move upriver to attack the eastern land redoubts. The critical period of the attack developed shortly after midnight when a picked British force in longboats armed with scaling ladders under Napier&#x27;s command penetrated the Middle or Ferry Branch of the river along the southern opposite shore (today&#x27;s Brooklyn and Fairfield areas of southern Baltimore City and Anne Arundel County) to the west of the fort with the intention of storming it from the rear flank. Before they could land, however, they were detected and subjected to a withering fire from the still active guns of Fort McHenry and two smaller forts to the west, batteries Covington and Babcock. The British fought back strongly with cannon and rockets. (Watching the battle from a safe distance, Georgetown lawyer and poet Francis Scott Key, who had been attempting to free William Beanes, arrested earlier for jailing British Army deserters, was inspired to compose the poem, &quot;The Defence of Fort McHenry&quot;, which was later set to music as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;). Eventually American firepower prevailed; Napier was compelled to retire to the warships with substantial casualties, and Cochrane&#x27;s fleet later withdrew on the morning of the 14th, with the Americans raising a substantially huge 42 by 30-foot flag, with the firing of the traditional morning gun at daylight, after the night&#x27;s driving rainstorm and bombardments, enabling all to see from the town that the fort had held.

&quot;Euryalus&quot; proceeded to Halifax, Nova Scotia for refitting and then took part in the ongoing blockade of the eastern seaboard of the U.S.A.. Bored by such duties, Napier issued a challenge to the famous American, Baltimore-built frigate , which had been lying in on the Elizabeth River harbor near the U.S. Naval base at Norfolk, Virginia, (since making her only war cruise during the first year of the War) to come out and fight a single-ship duel. The challenge was accepted and due arrangements were made &#x27;in the most gentlemanly fashion&#x27;, but &quot;Euryalus&quot; was made part of the squadron that Admiral Cochrane took to Florida and Louisiana in December 1814 in the operations that climaxed in the Battle of New Orleans on 8 January 1815, and before she could return to fulfil her engagement with &quot;Constellation&quot; news of the peace treaty of Ghent reached the USA.

With Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba and brief return to power, (the &#x27;Hundred Days&#x27;), &quot;Euryalus&quot; returned to Britain. Napier&#x27;s last mission of the Napoleonic wars was to land troops at the mouth of the River Scheldt to guard against the French advance into Belgium.

==Marriage and family==
At the end of the war Napier was made a Companion of the Bath (4 June 1815). He married Frances Elizabeth Elers, née Younghusband, generally referred to as Eliza, whom he had known and loved in Edinburgh while still a teenager. In the meantime Eliza had married a Lieutenant Edward Elers and been widowed. She had four children whom Napier adopted as his own. Of these the second son, Charles Elers Napier, became a naval officer. The eldest, Edward Elers Napier, entered the army, rising to the rank of major-general: he also wrote books of travel and reminiscence, as well as the authoritative biography of his stepfather. Frances also gave Napier two children of his own, a son born in Rome and a daughter born by Lake Geneva. The son, Charles, died as a result of an accident aged five. The first years of his leisure Napier spent in Italy, Switzerland (where he briefly took up farming), and in Paris. He had inherited considerable wealth from his mother&#x27;s side of the family and spent it freely.

==Steam and iron==
During these years Napier began a voluminous and indefatigable correspondence with the Admiralty on the urgency for naval reform, which lasted for the rest of his career. He sought to persuade successive civil administrations of the need for innovative ship-design and tactics, the development of steam ships and the use of iron in ship construction, the proper training of officers, and decent living conditions for ordinary seamen. He held that the use of the press gang and of flogging should be abolished, and that seamen should receive proper wages and pensions. In all this he was far ahead of his time. His advocacy had little effect: on the contrary, successive administrators considered him an eccentric nuisance. He had been interested in steam navigation since its beginnings, and began investing his considerable resources in a steam vessel service that would ply along the River Seine. In 1821 he financed and participated in the construction of one of the first iron-hulled vessels ever built, and the first designed to venture into open water. The &quot;Aaron Manby&quot; was named after the master of the Horseley Ironworks, Tipton, Staffordshire, where she was pre-fabricated to a design formulated by Napier, Manby and Manby&#x27;s son Charles and then assembled at Rotherhithe on the Thames. After trials in May 1822, the &quot;Aaron Manby&quot; crossed the English Channel to Le Havre under Napier&#x27;s command on 10 June 1822, and proceeded up the Seine to Paris, where she caused a great stir and where she was based for the next decade. This has been claimed as the first passage from France to Britain by steam ship, which it was not: but it was the first direct passage from London to Paris by steam ship and the first seagoing voyage by an iron ship anywhere. Napier&#x27;s company built five similar steamships but in 1827 he went bankrupt, leaving the family in severe financial difficulty. (Sold off, the ships gave 30 years further service.)

==Portugal==

At the beginning of 1829 he was appointed to command the 42-gun frigate . The Admiralty gave him permission to fit her with paddles of his own design, worked by winches on the main deck. He carried out trials that proved that ships could travel independently of the wind. The Admiralty, however, did not adopt this innovation.

At the start of Portugal&#x27;s Liberal Wars in 1832 Napier was at the Azores, which were the only part of Portuguese territory still held for Queen Maria II of Portugal against the usurpation of her uncle, the absolutist Dom Miguel. He so impressed the constitutional leaders, especially the Count de Vila Flor (better known by his later title of Duke of Terceira), that they begged him to take command of their small fleet. Having unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary by-election for Portsmouth in June 1832 after &quot;Galatea&quot; was paid off, he accepted their proposals in February 1833.

Sailing to Portugal with his stepson Charles Elers Napier as aide-de-camp, bringing troop reinforcements and using the incognito of &#x27;Carlos da Ponza&#x27;, he arrived in Porto, where Queen Maria&#x27;s father Dom Pedro, ex-Emperor of Brazil, and the Liberal forces were being besieged by Miguel&#x27;s armies. He assumed command of the Liberal fleet, succeeding its previous British commander George Rose Sartorius.

With the fleet Napier then transported the Liberal army to the Algarve to open a second front in the south of the country. On his return voyage he destroyed the much larger Miguelite fleet in the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 5 July 1833. These two strokes enabled the Liberals to capture Lisbon, which the Miguelites abandoned, though Napier&#x27;s squadron was now ravaged by cholera.

On the demand of France Napier was struck off the British navy list. On the other hand, Dom Pedro appointed him Admiral of the Portuguese Navy on 10 July. Napier&#x27;s victory, with a fleet largely manned by British seamen, was viewed in Britain as a credit to the Royal Navy. The victory and consequent accolades greatly annoyed King William IV, who disliked both Napier and Dom Pedro.

Continuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon, September 1833. For these services he was made Commander of the Tower and Sword, and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the Peerage of Portugal.

On 12 September 1833 he captured &quot;The Lord of the Isles&quot; steamer at Sao Martinho and in 1836 defended his prize in the Court of Common Pleas.

In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the Minho region for the constitutional cause. After the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the restored Portuguese parliament.

Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth parliamentary seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.

==Syrian War==

Though he published his &quot;An Account of the War in Portugal&quot; as &#x27;Admiral Charles Napier&#x27;, he was only an Admiral as far as Portugal was concerned. He was restored to his former rank of captain in the British Navy List by an Order in Council on 9 March 1836, and in July 1837 unsuccessfully contested the by-election for Greenwich in the Liberal cause. In 1838 received command of the ship of the line HMS &quot;Powerful&quot; (84 guns).

When troubles broke out in Syria and Muhammad Ali, ruler of Egypt, invaded it and destroyed a Turkish army, Napier was ordered to the Mediterranean. On the evening of 29 May 1839 &quot;Powerful&quot; was anchored in the Cove of Cork, Ireland when urgent orders came from the Admiralty to proceed at once to Malta. He was also informed that the ships-of-the-line &quot;Ganges&quot; and &quot;Implacable&quot; had already started from England. Wishing to overtake them, Napier set sail at 2 a.m. on the 30th for Gibraltar. &quot;Powerful&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 12 June to hear the other two ships were three days ahead of her, but by superior seamanship Napier overtook them in the Mediterranean and &quot;Powerful&quot; entered the harbour of La Valletta, Malta on the evening of 24 June, with band playing and under every stitch of canvas, twelve hours ahead of her rivals. There followed a lull of about a year.

In the summer of 1840 the Maronite Christians of Lebanon rose in revolt against the occupying Egyptians and Muhammad Ali in retaliation sent Ibrahim Pasha with 15,000 troops to burn towns and villages along the Lebanese coast. By 1 July 1840 Napier, with a detached squadron and the rank of commodore, was patrolling the coast to protect British interests. Though in August he appeared off Beirut and called upon Suleiman Pasha, Muhammad Ali&#x27;s governor, to abandon the town and leave Syria, there was little he could do until September, when he was joined by the allied fleet under Admiral Robert Stopford: mainly British, but also including Austrian, Ottoman and Russian warships. Open war broke out on 11 September. Due to the illness of the army commander, Brigadier-General Sir Charles Smith, Napier was instructed to lead the land force, and effected a landing at D&#x27;jounie with 1,500 Turks and marines to operate against Ibrahim, who was prevented by the revolt from doing more than trying to hold the coastal cities. Meanwhile, Stopford, claiming his flag of truce had been fired on, bombarded Beirut, killing many civilians. Napier next distinguished himself by leading an attack by land and sea on Sidon, the Egyptian army&#x27;s southern base, which capitulated on 28 September.

The Egyptians abandoned Beirut on 3 October. While preparing to attack them at Boharsef, Napier was ordered to relinquish command of the army to withdraw and hand over the land forces to the now recovered Brigadier-General Smith. To do so would have meant giving up the tactical initiative, and Napier accordingly disobeyed the order and continued with the attack against Ibrahim&#x27;s army. The ensuing Battle of Boharsef, on 10 October, was a hard-fought victory, one of the very few land battles won by a naval officer. By the end of the month the only coastal position still held by the Egyptians was Acre, which Stopford was instructed to recapture. 

On 3 November the Mediterranean Fleet, with its Turkish and Austrian allies, moved into position against the western and southern sides of the town. The fire of the ships (48,000 rounds in all) was devastatingly accurate. A shell penetrated the main magazine in the south of the city, which exploded killing 1,100 men. That night Acre was occupied. British losses were only 18 men killed and 41 wounded. During the action, Napier had manoeuvred independently against Stopford&#x27;s orders and his division, by accident and mutual misunderstandings, left a space in the fleet&#x27;s deployment, not that this affected the outcome. Some captains wanted Napier to be court-martialled for insubordination, but Stopford did not push the issue.

The rapid collapse of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s power, with the prospect of bloody chaos in Egypt, was not part of the Allies&#x27; plan, so Stopford sent Napier to command the squadron at Alexandria and to observe the situation. Here, acting once again on his own initiative, Napier appeared before the city on 25 November and enforced a blockade.

Napier, without reference to his admiral or the British government, personally negotiated a peace with Muhammad Ali. The treaty guaranteed Muhammad Ali and his heirs the sovereignty of Egypt, and pledged to evacuate Ibrahim&#x27;s beleaguered army back to Alexandria, if Muhammad Ali in turn renounced all claims to Syria, submitted to the Sultan and returned the Ottoman fleet. &#x27;I do not know if I have done right in settling the eastern question&#x27;, Napier wrote on 26 November to Lord Minto, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Stopford repudiated the arrangement immediately when he had heard the news; the Sultan and the British ambassador were furious, and several of the Allied powers declared it void. Nevertheless, the formal treaty later concluded and confirmed on 27 November was essentially a ratification of Napier&#x27;s original, and his friend Lord Palmerston congratulated Napier. (Muhammad Ali&#x27;s last heir, King Farouk, ruled Egypt until 23 July 1952, when the Free Officers Movement under Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser staged a military coup that launched the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and forced him to abdicate.)

==Parliament and Channel Fleet==
In acknowledgement of his distinguished services during the campaign Napier was knighted as a KCB on 4 December 1840, and was also included in the vote of thanks by the Houses of Parliament. He was also presented by the Emperors of Russia and Austria and the King of Prussia with the Order of St. George of Russia; the Order of Maria Theresa of Austria; and the Red Eagle of Prussia. In January 1841, Napier carried out a special mission to Alexandria and Cairo to see that the treaty was being adhered to before returning to Britain in March.

He was invited to stand as Parliamentary candidate in two constituencies and so at his own request was placed on half pay. He was returned as Liberal Party MP for Marylebone at the 1841 general election. He spoke mainly on naval topics, especially conditions for seamen and increasing the strength of the navy. In April 1842, with 67 other MPs, he voted for the motion of William Sharman Crawford to form a committee to consider the demands of the People&#x27;s Charter (1838): votes for working men, protected by secret ballot.

In November, 1841, Napier was appointed Naval Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria. He subsequently wrote and published &quot;War in Syria&quot;, his personal account of the campaign. On 4 December 1845 he was invested with the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh.

Napier continued to be interested in warship design and was responsible for the design of the paddle-frigate launched in May 1846. In the same year he was promoted rear-admiral of the Blue on 9 November. in May 1847 he was appointed to the command of the Channel Fleet, hoisting his flag in HMS &quot;St Vincent&quot;. By this time he was perhaps the naval personality most famous to the general public: his level of everyday name-recognition is shown by the passing allusion in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s famous humorous ballad &quot;Little Billee &quot; (&quot;the British fleet a-riding at anchor / with Admiral Napier, K.C.B.&quot;). He did not stand again for his parliamentary seat at Marylebone in the July–August 1847 general election.

The Channel Fleet was sometimes a sinecure, but this was by no means the case during Napier&#x27;s period of command. The fleet&#x27;s area of operations was not just the English Channel but more or less throughout what in the 20th century would be called the Western Approaches. Portugal was in the closing stages of its &#x27;little&#x27; civil war, the Patuleia, and British interests in that country needed protecting. Ireland, in the aftermath of the Great Famine, was feared to be near insurrection. Moreover, there were considerations of experiment and training with new ships, made necessary by the rapid technological advances such as screw propulsion.
During 1848, the fleet was mainly off the coast of Ireland, where the political situation dictated that Napier show the flag and train for the eventuality of transporting and landing soldiers on practically any part of the Irish coast. In December he took the Channel Fleet further than it had ever operated before, when it was sent to Gibraltar and then onto the Moroccan coast, with the purpose of curbing the activities of Riff pirates. He compelled the Sultan of Morocco, Muley Abderrahman, to grant compensation for the injuries he had inflicted on British commerce.

Napier returned to Britain in April 1849 and was ordered to strike his flag. His disappointment that his expected three years term had been cut short led to bitter letters to &quot;The Times&quot; criticising the Admiralty&#x27;s policy. When he applied for the vacant Mediterranean command, the Government and Admiralty agreed that he could not be trusted and he was rejected, Rear-Admiral Sir James Dundas being appointed instead. This led Napier to write more angry letters to the newspapers and directly to Prime Minister Lord John Russell claiming that he had been defrauded of his just rights. He unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat for the Borough of Lambeth at a by-election on 7 August 1850. On 28 May 1853 he was promoted to vice-admiral of the Blue.

==Baltic Campaign of the Crimean War==

On the outbreak of the Crimean War, Napier received the command of the Baltic Fleet, the largest fleet which the Royal Navy had assembled since the Napoleonic Wars. This was not without misgivings on the part of the Admiralty, but he was the most senior and experienced officer available. Napier hoisted his flag in February 1854 in the steam ship of the line , his subordinate commanders being the rear-admirals Armar Lowry Corry, second in command, Henry Ducie Chads, third in command, and James Hanway Plumridge, commanding the scouting forces. They were all elderly men, at most a year or so younger than Napier himself.

Napier&#x27;s force, which was augmented in June by a French fleet sent by Napoleon III and commanded by Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes, though impressive on paper, was radically unsuited to operations in the Baltic Sea and chronically short of men and especially of experienced seamen. He was also hampered by contradictory sets of orders from the Admiralty. Nevertheless, he successfully blockaded all the Russian ports, sufficiently overawed the Russian Baltic Fleet that it never stirred from its moorings, and carried out many bombardment operations as far as the northernmost point of the Gulf of Finland. During the campaign the first ever Victoria Cross was won by midshipman Charles Davis Lucas of the gunboat , who threw a Russian explosive shell overboard before it could detonate. During the campaign Rear-Admiral Corry was invalided home because of poor health; he was replaced by Commodore (later Rear-Admiral) Henry Byam Martin.

The major success of the campaign was the capture and destruction, in a near-perfect combined operation by French and British soldiers and sailors, of the Russian fortress of Bomarsund on Åland, which were temporarily liberated from Russian rule and which Napier offered to Sweden (they were declined). When Napier refused to attack the great naval bases at Sveaborg (often quoted as the &quot;Gibraltar of the north&quot;) and Kronstadt, which observation had established were probably impregnable without shallow-draught bomb vessels which he did not have, a great outcryled by &quot;The Times&quot;was raised against him for his apparent lack of determination. His inaction was thoroughly justified by the sequel: in 1855 a better-equipped Anglo-French fleet did bombard Sveaborg, but despite an enormous expenditure of ammunition caused the fortress only trifling structural damage. Napier felt he was continually being second-guessed by the Admiralty, and especially by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir James Graham. In fact the Naval Lords were reacting to adverse press coverage and unwilling to accept the assessment of the commander on the spot, and relations between them deteriorated as his ships maintained the blockade in atrocious weather, quite unable to storm or destroy impregnable Russian fortresses into the bargain.

Never one to mince his words or submit to what he felt to be unmerited criticism, Napier&#x27;s &#x27;disrespectful&#x27; tone in his despatches, which the Admiralty complained of, sealed his professional fate. Nevertheless, though lacking any dramatic action apart from the capture of Bomarsund, Napier had achieved a great deal. In one modern assessment, the campaign &quot;had successfully bottled up the Russian Navy for the entire first summer of the war. The tsar had been denied an opportunity to reinforce his Black Sea fleet with additional ships. The 30,000 Russian troops posted in the Gulf had also been prevented from joining the army in the Crimea.&quot; In addition, Napier&#x27;s constant training had welded the fleet personnel into a much more competent force for the next year&#x27;s campaign; and not a single ship had been lost.
==Retirement==
On Napier&#x27;s return from the Baltic to Britain in December 1854 he was ordered to haul down his flag and informed his command was terminated,
the fleet being given for the campaign of 1855 to Admiral the Hon. Richard Saunders Dundas,
the Second Sea Lord. (None of the flag officers of the 1854 campaign was allowed to return to the Baltic in 1855, but Sir Michael Seymour, Napier&#x27;s Captain of the Fleet, was promoted to rear-admiral and was made second-in-command to Dundas.)

The Admiralty attempted to make Napier a scapegoat for the perceived failure of the campaign (which, within the limits of the possible, had been rather successful) and suborned several captains to testify to their lack of confidence in him, his timidity, his age, his lack of understanding of steam tactics, and his heavy drinking. Nevertheless, some of the leading seamen in the fleet, such as Captain (later Admiral) Sir Bartholomew Sulivan, maintained along with him that Napier&#x27;s strategy had been wise and the faults lay with the Admiralty themselves.

After the war the Russians testified that, knowing Napier&#x27;s reputation, their main hope had been of his making a foolhardy attack on their fleet under the guns of Kronstadt, where they were confident he would have come to grief. Napier was elected MP for Southwark in February 1855, and carried his dispute with the Admiralty to the floor of the House of Commons. He never received another command. He continued to campaign vigorously for improvements in the way common seamen were treated during and after service, and maintained his parliamentary seat, though broken in health, until his death on 6 November 1860. His tomb is in the churchyard of All Saints, Catherington in Hampshire. The ships of the Portuguese Navy went into eight days of mourning for their former commander.

Just before his death Napier had hoped to persuade Giuseppe Garibaldi to acquire a fleet for the liberation of Italy, which he would have commanded.

==Character==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; entry of 1911, &quot;Sir Charles Napier was a man of undoubted energy and courage, but of no less eccentricity and vanity. He caused great offence to many of his brother officers by his behaviour to his superior, Admiral Stopford, in the Syrian War, and was embroiled all his life in quarrels with the Admiralty.&quot; Napier was a large, untidy man of about 14 stone &quot;(about 200lbs/90kg)&quot; who walked with a limp and a stoop due to his leg and neck wounds. His common nickname in the Navy was &#x27;Black Charlie&#x27; because of his swarthy appearance and dark side-whiskers. He was also known as &#x27;Mad Charlie&#x27; because of his eccentric behaviour and enthusiasms, and &#x27;Dirty Charlie&#x27; from his habit of wearing the most unsuitable and ill-fitting clothes while insisting that his officers were correctly dressed at all times.

<doc id="641840" wikidata="Q3523730" url="?curid=641840" title="Eskimo kinship">
<text>Eskimo kinship is a category of kinship used to define family organization in anthropology. Identified by Lewis H. Morgan in his 1871 work &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot;, the Eskimo system was one of six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese). The system of English-language kinship terms falls into the Eskimo type.

==Joint family==
The joint family system places no distinction between patrilineal and matrilineal relatives; instead, it focuses on differences in kinship distance (the closer the relative is, the more distinctions are made). The system emphasizes the nuclear family, identifying directly only the mother, father, brother, and sister. All other relatives are grouped together into categories. It uses both classificatory and descriptive terms, differentiating between gender, generation, lineal relatives (relatives in the direct line of descent), and collateral relatives (blood relatives not in the direct line of descent). The Eskimo system is defined by its &quot;cognatic&quot; or &quot;bilateral&quot; emphasis - no distinction is made between patrilineal and matrilineal relatives.

Parental siblings are distinguished only by their sex (aunt, uncle). All children of these individuals are lumped together regardless of sex (cousins). Unlike the Hawaiian system, Ego&#x27;s parents are clearly distinguished from their siblings.
==Usage==
The Eskimo system is relatively common among the world&#x27;s kinship systems, at about 10% of the world&#x27;s societies. It is now common in most Western societies (such as those of Europe or the Americas). In addition, it is found among a small number of food-foraging peoples such as the ǃKung tribe of Africa and the Inuit (Inuit-Yupik) for whom it is named.

The system is widely used in non-unilineal societies, where the dominant relatives are the immediate family. In most Western societies, the nuclear family represents an independent social and economic group, which has caused the emphasis on the immediate kinship. The tendency of families in Western societies to live apart also reinforces this.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Eskimo&quot; is considered pejorative in Canada, and has been replaced there by the term &quot;Inuit&quot;. The former remains in use in Alaska, though less so than in past decades, because the term includes both Inuit and non-Inuit Native Alaskans. In Canada, the term &quot;Inuit kinship&quot; is therefore widely used instead of &quot;Eskimo kinship&quot;.

<text>Beit HaKerem, Beth-haccerem (, &quot;lit&quot;. &quot;house of the vineyard&quot;; Beth HakKerem in Biblical Hebrew) is a biblical place associated with the Tribe of Judah ().

==Possible location==
Some identify Beit HaKerem with Ein Kerem. Others place Beit HaKerem south of Jerusalem, at Ramat Rachel, where cairns on the ridge may have served as beacons of old. Others say it was near Tekoa, later known as Herodium. Neubauer, citing the Church Father Jerome, writes that from Bethlehem one could see &quot;Bethacharma&quot;, thought to be the Beit HaKerem of Jeremiah. According to the Bible, the trumpet sounded against the invading army of Babylon at this place (Jeremiah 6:1).

Beit Hakerem was a district center during the Persian Period and is mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah as one of the towns resettled by the Jewish exiles returning from the Babylonian captivity and who helped to construct the walls of Jerusalem during the reign of Artaxerxes I (Xerxes). Nehemiah further records that those returnees were the very descendants of the people who had formerly resided in the town before their banishment from the country, who had all returned to live in their former places of residence.

The Mishnah, compiled in the 2nd-century CE, mentions &quot;the valley of Beth-Kerem&quot; being a place where there was reddish-brown earth. Likewise, the stones of the altar built in Jerusalem and the stones of the ramp that led up to the altar were taken from the valley of Beth Kerem, where they were quarried from below virgin soil and brought from thence as whole stones upon which no implement of iron had been lifted up.

Archaeological finds at Ramat Rachel have yielded dozens of seal impressions on jar handles from the 4th-3rd centuries BCE bearing the inscription &quot;yehud,&quot; the official name of the province of Judah in this period.

<text>Stanthorpe is a rural town and locality in the Southern Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Stanthorpe had a population of 5,286 people.

The area surrounding the town is known as the Granite Belt.

== Geography ==
Stanthorpe lies on the New England Highway near the New South Wales border from Brisbane via Warwick, north of Tenterfield and 811m above sea level. The record low temperature of -10.6 °C (12.9 °F) was registered on June 23, 1961 in Stanthorpe. This is the lowest temperature recorded in Queensland.

Stanthorpe was developed around Quart Pot Creek which meanders from south-east through the centre of town and then out through the south-west, where its confluence with Spring Creek forms the Severn River. Quart Pot Creek forms part of the south-western boundary of the locality, while the Severn River forms part of the south-western boundary.

The New England Highway passes through the locality from Applethorpe in the north to Severnlea in the south. Originally it passed through the town centre along the main street, Maryland Street. However, it now bypasses to the west of the main developed area of the town. The Stanthorpe–Texas–Inglewood Road connects Stanthorpe and Broadwater to the west, then travels south-west to Texas.

The land within the boundaries of Stanthorpe is primarily used for urban purposes: housing, recreational, commercial and industrial with some undeveloped land on the hillier slopes. Although an agricultural centre of the Granite Belt, there is little agriculture within the town&#x27;s boundaries. Crops grown in the surrounding area include vegetables, apples, grapes and stone fruit. Wine is also produced in the area, and sheep and cattle grazing is also prevalent.

The town lies in the valley of Quart Pot Creek and its tributary Funkers Gap Creek () at above sea level.

The locality has the following mountains:

* Lees Hill, south of the town () 
* Mount Banca, north-west of the town () 
* Mount Marlay, north-east of the town () 
== History ==
Prior to British settlement, the Kambuwal were an Indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland. Norman Tindale estimated that the Kambuwal&#x27;s territory stretched over . They straddled the border between Queensland and New South Wales, from south of Millmerran, and Inglewood to Bonshaw. Their eastern flank ended around Stanthorpe, Wallangarra and the western scarp of the Great Dividing Range.

Stanthorpe was founded by tin miners. People came from many countries to mine tin from 1872. Prior to 1872 this area boasted some large pastoral runs and a few prospectors in bark huts. At that time, the area was known as &#x27;Quart Pot Creek&#x27;. The Private Township of Stannum existed in the area along one side of the present main street. With the discovery of tin and the influx of miners and new businesses, a &#x27;more suitable&#x27; name was sought by the town fathers. Thus, Stanthorpe became the name which encompassed all, as this area became for a time, the largest alluvial tin mining and mineral field in Queensland. Stanthorpe literally means &#x27;tintown&#x27;, as Stannum is Latin for &#x27;tin&#x27; and thorpe is Middle English for &#x27;village&#x27;. The Queensland Surveyor General, Augustus Charles Gregory, is credited with coining the name in 1872.

When the tin prices fell, many miners turned to farming. The subtropical highland climate was very suitable for growing cool climate fruits and vegetables. Grapes were first planted here in the 1860s with encouragement from the local Catholic parish priest Father Jerome Davadi to produce altar wine. His Italian descent made grape growing and wine production a familiar pastime and the notion caught on in the area. There were plenty of Italian settlers and wine was made for home enjoyment.

Mount Marlay was named after Edward Marlay, a selector and tin miner. On 3 July 1872 he purchased Allotment 1, Section 1 in the Town of Stanthorpe.

In July 1872, Presbyterian minister John McAra arrived in Stanthorpe and established a congregation. On 17 November 1872, the Stanthorpe Presbyterian Church was opened by the Reverend Colin McCulloch.

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School was established in October 1872 by four Sisters of Mercy: Sisters M Agnes, Emilian, Muredach and Malachy.

Stanthorpe State School opened on 9 March 1874.

On Tuesday 3 May 1881, the Southern railway line was officially opened to Stanthorpe by the Queensland Colonial Secretary, Arthur Palmer.The Post Office with a clock tower and an elaborate coat of arms was constructed in Maryland Street in 1901 in the Arts and Crafts style. Following Federation, the Commonwealth Government took charge of post and telegraphic services. However, they contracted the construction of post offices in Queensland to the Public Works Department of the Queensland Government and the Stanthorpe Post Office is believed to be one of the first ordered by the Commonwealth Government. It was designed by the first Commonwealth Government Architect John Smith Murdoch.

The cool dry climate was valued as an aid to health from the early nineteenth century especially for those suffering from tuberculosis or chest conditions. Following the First World War, Stanthorpe was a major resettlement area for soldiers recovering from mustard gas exposure. Many of these Soldier Settlers took up the land leased to them in the areas around Stanthorpe which now bear the names of First World War battlefields.

Stanthorpe State High School opened on 23 January 1961.

The Stanthorpe Regional Art Gallery was established in 1972.

<text>Riley Weston (born August 25, 1966) is an American actress and writer. Weston became embroiled in a debate about ageism in Hollywood after it was discovered that she lied about her age to get work in the entertainment industry.

==Early life==

&quot;...she changed her name to Riley Elizabeth Weston (she declines to give her real surname but says her birth name is Kimberlee)&quot; — Los Angeles Times

Weston graduated from Arlington High School outside of Poughkeepsie. 

==Career==
===Early work===

&quot;After graduating in 1984, she moved to LA and started calling herself Kimberlee Kramer—it sounded more actressy, she felt, than Kimberlee Seaman.&quot; — Bernard Weinraub, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; January 1999&lt;ref name=&quot;lukeford/riley-weston&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1987, Weston carved out a career as a film and television actor, working steadily throughout her twenties in a series of mostly small bit parts. Her credits included the sitcoms &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; and &quot;3rd Rock From The Sun&quot;, and the film &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot;. Through about 1996, she was credited in her appearances as &quot;Kimberlee Kramer&quot;.

===Age deception and &quot;Felicity&quot;===
In May 1997, and by now using the name Riley Weston, she began claiming her date of birth as 1979 in order to be considered for further acting roles. The deception was assisted by her slight build, at tall and weighing .

&quot;...her reason for lying about her age had nothing to do with scoring a writing job on the hot new teen show airing on the WB and was rooted in her acting dream...it was her choice to lie about her age to get acting gigs that caused the problem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wTw/felicity-writer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, she began drafting screenplays and marketing herself to television studios as a recent high school graduate.&lt;ref name=&quot;thewrap/arthur-axelman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was soon hired by the WB Network as a writer for the show &quot;Felicity&quot; after they saw one of her scripts about teenage sisters. Hailed as a child prodigy and &quot;wunderkind&quot;, by publications such as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, which included her in its October 1998 list of the &quot;100 Most Creative People in Entertainment&quot;, which described her as an up-and-coming 19-year-old. Shortly thereafter, she was offered a half-million dollar screenwriting deal with Disney. Series co-creator Matt Reeves cast her as a teenage character in one episode.

After &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; began working on a segment about Weston, her real identity and age emerged This occurred after &quot;Daily Variety&quot; published an October 15, 1998 article reporting that it had obtained court documents showing that Weston had changed her name in 1997 from Kimberlee Elizabeth Kramer, and had been born in 1966 rather than 1979. The day the report was published, Weston admitted that she lied to nearly every individual and entity she interacted with professionally, including her agents, attorneys, colleagues, Disney, and the media. Only her family and manager/ex-husband knew her true identity, a ruse she was able to maintain for as long as she did because, as she explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a lot of friends.&quot; She also created false identification documents, wore baggy clothes typically worn by teenagers at the time, brought her mother to meetings, and made comments more common to teens, such as working as a babysitter and having a crush on popular teen idol Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

Weston apologized for her deception, telling &quot;Daily Variety&quot;, &quot;I take full responsibility. I&#x27;m completely sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone.&quot; She also explained her rationale for lying about her age, stating that it was &quot;accepted practice for actresses to lie about their age&quot;, owing to &quot;age bias&quot; in the entertainment industry. Weston elaborated:

&quot;I wanted to have a job. I wanted to work as an actor, but if I&#x27;d go into a casting office to play a 15-year-old, and they’d say, &#x27;How old are you?&#x27; and I said 30, they’d laugh. No one believes I&#x27;m 32...If they based (the deal) on my age, there’s an age problem in Hollywood. They bought into this, and there&#x27;s something hugely wrong with it. Look at what I had to do. Someone has to put a stop to it. If I were getting a job in any other industry, do you think anyone would care how old I am or how I look?&quot;

She also stated that she changed her name partially for &quot;security reasons&quot; due to harassment by a stalker she had faced beginning in 1993.

Weston left &quot;Felicity&quot; in the middle of the first season after her contract had expired and was not renewed. Series co-creator Matt Reeves explained during a 2021 interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;People thought that we let her go because of it. None of that was true at all. The story was blown so crazy out of proportion from the perspective of our relationship with Riley. We did discover that she was not telling us the truth, but it was after she had already finished her term. When you sign somebody on as a staff writer in those days, you had a number of scripts that you signed them to do. We just put her on the show because we thought, &#x27;Well, let&#x27;s just let her do what we know she really wants to do as well, which is to be an actor.&#x27; It got turned into a scandal that I&#x27;m not sure ever was.

<text>Port Ellen () is a small town on the island of Islay, in Argyll, Scotland. The town is named after the wife of its founder, Walter Frederick Campbell. Its previous name, &quot;Leòdamas&quot;, is derived from Old Norse meaning &quot;Leòd&#x27;s Harbour&quot;.

Port Ellen is built around Leodamais Bay, Islay&#x27;s main deep water harbour. It is the largest town on Islay, only slightly larger than Bowmore and provides the main ferry connection between Islay and the mainland, at Kennacraig. The Port Ellen Distillery was first established in the 1820s and ceased production of Scotch whisky in 1983, until reopening in 2024. The large malting continues to produce for the majority of the distilleries on Islay.

==History==
The area around Port Ellen has a variety of archaeological sites covering the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age periods. There are standing stones at Kilbride, a fort at Borraichill Mor, several chambered cairns, and a chapel at Cill Tobar Lasrach. Nearby lie the ruined remains of the 14th-century Dunyvaig Castle, once a fortress of the MacDonald Lords of the Isles.

The current town was planned by Walter Frederick Campbell and founded in 1821 originally intended to support the herring industry. It was originally called Port Ellinor in honour of his wife, Lady Eleanor Charteris (d. 1832), daughter of Francis Douglas, 8th Earl of Wemyss.

==Notable people==
George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen, Labour politician and former Secretary General of NATO was born in Port Ellen on 12 April 1946.

<text>The United States Metric Board (USMB) was a United States government agency set up to encourage metrication. The United States Metric Board was commissioned by the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205d, enacted on December 23, 1975). The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 mandated the presidential appointment of seventeen members for the &quot;independent instrumentality&quot;.

The board was composed of one member from the following agencies and/or related communities: engineers, scientists, the National Association of Manufacturers, the United States Chamber of Commerce, National Governors Conference, construction, National Conference on Weights and Measures, education, two members each from the AFL–CIO and small business, and four at-large members &quot;to represent consumers&quot;, for a total of seventeen members in all.

The metrification assessment board existed from 1975 to 1982, ending when President Ronald Reagan abolished it, largely on the suggestion of Frank Mankiewicz and Lyn Nofziger.

<doc id="641851" wikidata="Q3275393" url="?curid=641851" title="George F. L. Charles Airport">
<text>George F. L. Charles Airport (commonly known as Vigie Airport) is the smaller of the two airports in Saint Lucia, the other being Hewanorra International Airport. It is located north of Castries, the capital city. George F. L. Charles Airport is managed by the Saint Lucia Air and Seaports Authority (SLASPA). Its runway runs parallel to a pristine beach, Vigie Beach, which is a popular tourist attraction.

==Historical airline service==

British West Indies Airways (BWIA) was serving Vigie Field (which was the previous name of the airport) as early as 1950 with flights operated one or more days of the week to Barbados, Grenada, Port of Spain, Trinidad, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Antigua and St. Kitts operated with Lockheed Lodestar prop aircraft. By 1965, BWIA was operating daily flights into the airport with Vickers Viscount turboprop airliners on a round trip routing of Port of Spain - Grenada - Barbados - St. Lucia - Martinique - Guadeloupe - Antigua. The same year, Leeward Islands Air Transport was operating a round trip flight six days a week on a routing of Antigua - Guadeloupe - Dominica - Martinique - St. Lucia - St. Vincent with Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprop aircraft. By the summer of 2001, American Eagle was operating six daily flights from the airport nonstop to San Juan on behalf of American Airlines via a code sharing agreement with these services being flown by San Juan-based Executive Airlines with ATR-42 and ATR-72 turboprop aircraft.

==Renaming of airport==

The airport was renamed on 4 August 1997 in honour of Saint Lucia politician Sir George Frederick Lawrence Charles (1916–2004). The airport had previously been known as Vigie Field.

==Traffic==

On average, George F. L. Charles Airport handles 32,000 flights per year carrying 394,000 passengers. Most of these flights operate with turboprop aircraft such as the ATR 72-500 or the de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8.

The airport currently has no scheduled jet service. All jet services into St. Lucia, including transatlantic flights, operate at the present time via Hewanorra International Airport, located on the southeast portion of the island.

==Previous jet service==

The airport previously had scheduled passenger jet service flown by Caribair which in 1968 was operating McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners on a daily basis with nonstop flights to Antigua and Barbados with direct jet service to Port of Spain, Trinidad, St. Maarten, San Juan, Puerto Rico, St. Croix and St. Thomas. In 1973, Leeward Islands Air Transport (LIAT) was operating stretched British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven series 500 twin jets on nonstop flights to Antigua, Barbados and Fort-de-France, Martinique as well as direct, no change of plane jet service with the BAC One-Eleven to Port of Spain, Trinidad, St. Maarten and San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1995, Carib Express was operating British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jet flights into the airport nonstop from Barbados, Dominica and St. Vincent as well as one stop BAe 146 service from Port of Spain and St. Kitts. Another previous jet operator was BWIA West Indies Airways (operating as BWIA International at the time) which in 1996 was operating McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliners between the airport and Miami twice a week and also twice a week between the airport and New York JFK Airport with both of these direct, no change of plane flights making an intermediate stop in Antigua as well as flying MD-80 service several days a week nonstop to Barbados with these flights then continuing on to Port of Spain.

<doc id="641856" wikidata="Q5015855" url="?curid=641856" title="Cabul">
<text>Cabul (), classical spelling: Chabolo; Chabulon, is a location in the Lower Galilee mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, now the Kabul local council in Israel, 9 or east of Acco.

==History==
===Bronze and Iron ages===
Cabul is first mentioned as one of the landmarks on the boundary of Asher, in . Josephus refers to it as &quot;the village of Chabolo situated in the confines of Ptolemais&quot;, and was the western border of Lower Galilee before joining the Phoenician coast. It was assigned to the Tribe of Asher. The name &quot;Kabul&quot; may have been derived from the Aramaic word &quot;mekubbal&quot;, which means &quot;clad&quot;, as in the inhabitants were &quot;clad&quot; in gold and silver.

King Solomon handed over a district in the north-west of Galilee near Tyre, containing twenty cities, to Hiram I, the king of Tyre, in repayment for his help in building Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem. Hiram was not pleased with the gift, however, and called them &quot;the land of Cabul&quot;, the name signifying &quot;good for nothing&quot;. The writer of 1 Kings 9 says they were called by this name &quot;to this day&quot;. Josephus interprets &quot;Cabul&quot; as meaning &quot;what does not please&quot; (in Phoenician) but doubt has been cast on this interpretation of the term. The Pulpit Commentary suggests they were unacceptable because &quot;really they were mere villages&quot;.

Archaeological excavations at Khirbet Rosh Zayit, located 2km northeast of modern Kabul, Israel, have revealed an Israelite settlement from the 12th century BCE, and built upon it a Phoenician fortification from the 10th century BCE. The excavator suggests that this is evidence of Solomon&#x27;s transfer of the area to Tyrian control.

===Classical era===
Josephus describes Cabul as being &quot;the place that divides the country of Ptolemais from our nation&quot; (&quot;War&quot; II 18:503). The architecture of Cabul, unlike other cities of the Galilee, was similar to that of Tyre, Sidon, and Beirut. In the First Jewish–Roman War, Cabul was attacked by Cestius Gallus in 66 CE. Upon the approach of the Roman army, the inhabitants of Cabul (, translated in some English texts as &quot;Zabulon&quot;) had fled the city, while the soldiery were given leave to plunder and burn the city. For a time it served as Josephus&#x27; headquarters in Galilee in 67 CE.

Judah and Hillel, sons of R. Gamaliel III, were received as guests in Cabul with great honor and paid a visit to a local bath. It was the home of a Rabbi Zakkai, and was famous for its abundance of wine and oil; it also had a synagogue and public baths. After the fall of Jerusalem, priests of the Shecaniah (Shekhanyah) family settled there.

===Middle Ages===
In the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, it was the seat of a seigniory known as Cabor.

==Aftermath==
In 2010, an archaeological survey of Cabul was conducted by Omar Zidan on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).

<text>Victor &quot;Vic&quot; Morrow ( Morozoff; February 14, 1929 – July 23, 1982) was an American actor. He came to prominence as one of the leads of the ABC drama series &quot;Combat!&quot; (1962–1967), which earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Series. Active on screen for over three decades, his film roles include &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955), &quot;King Creole&quot; (1958), &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot; (1958), &quot;Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; (1976). Morrow continued acting up to his death during filming of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983) when he and two child actors were killed in a helicopter crash on set.

==Early life==
Morrow was born in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Harry Morrow ( Morozoff), an electrical engineer, and Eugenia &quot;Jean&quot; ( Barmachenko). Morrow dropped out of high school when he was 17 and enlisted in the United States Navy. Morrow and his family lived in Asbury Park, New Jersey for many years.

==Career==
Morrow attracted attention playing Stanley Kowalski in a touring production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. His first movie role was in &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955), playing a thug student who torments teacher Glenn Ford.

It was made by MGM, who then put Morrow in &quot;Tribute to a Bad Man&quot; (1956). Morrow appeared on television, guest starring on shows like &quot;The Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;, &quot;Trackdown&quot;, &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;, and &quot;Telephone Time&quot;.

Morrow had support roles in &quot;Men in War&quot; (1957), directed by Anthony Mann, and was third billed in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Five Hours&quot; (1958). He starred alongside Elvis Presley and an all-star supporting cast including Walter Matthau and Carolyn Jones in the movie &quot;King Creole&quot; (1958), directed by Michael Curtiz. Mann asked him back for &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot; (1958).

A Man Called Sledge is a 1970 Italian Spaghetti Western film starring James Garner in an extremely offbeat role as a grimly hardened thief, and featuring Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins and Wayde Preston. The film was written by Vic Morrow and Frank Kowalski, and directed by Morrow in Techniscope.

However Morrow remained mostly a television actor, appearing in &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Wichita Town&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, &quot;The Lineup&quot;, &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;, &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot;, &quot;The Law and Mr. Jones&quot;, &quot;The Lawless Years&quot;, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Tall Man&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.

He was cast in the early &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;The Avenger&quot; as a mysterious figure known only as &quot;Lassiter&quot; – named after his town of origin – who arrives in Virginia City. He helps save Ben and Adam Cartwright from an unjust hanging, while eventually gunning down one sought-after man, revealing himself as the hunter of a lynch mob who killed his father. Having so far killed about half the mob, he rides off into the night, in an episode that resembles the later Clint Eastwood film &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;. Morrow later appeared in the third season &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;The Tin Badge&quot;.

Mann used Morrow a third time in &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1960), again tormenting Glenn Ford. He took on Audie Murphy in &quot;Posse from Hell&quot; (1961).

Morrow was cast as soldier-engineer Lt. Robert Benson in the 1962 episode, &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot;, on the syndicated anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The story focuses on Benson&#x27;s fiancé, Indiana (Shirley Ballard), who tries to persuade him to boost their income by selling inside Army information to criminal real estate moguls like Joseph Hooker (Howard Petrie). Trevor Bardette and Meg Wyllie were cast in the roles of Captain and Mrs. Warner.

Morrow had his first leading role in &quot;Portrait of a Mobster&quot; (1961) playing Dutch Schultz.

He continued as mostly a television actor, appearing in &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, and &quot;Suspense&quot;.

===&quot;Combat!&quot;===

Morrow was cast in the lead role of Sergeant &quot;Chip&quot; Saunders in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Combat!&quot;, a World War II drama, which aired from 1962 to 1967. Pop culture scholar Gene Santoro has written:
His friend and fellow actor on &quot;Combat!&quot;, Rick Jason, described Morrow as &quot;a master director&quot; who directed &quot;one of the greatest anti-war films I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. He was referring to the two-part episode of &quot;Combat!&quot; entitled &quot;Hills Are for Heroes&quot;, which was written by Gene L. Coon.

===&quot;Deathwatch&quot; and &quot;A Man Called Sledge&quot;===
Morrow also worked as a television director. Together with Leonard Nimoy, he produced the 1965 film &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, an English-language film version of Jean Genet&#x27;s play &quot;Deathwatch&quot; (title in ), adapted by Morrow and Barbara Turner, directed by Morrow, and starring Nimoy.

After &quot;Combat!&quot; ended, Morrow played the lead in &quot;&quot; (1969), the pilot for a proposed series that was not picked up; Roger Corman directed.

In 1969 he set up his own company, Carleigh, which was named after his daughters Carrie Ann and Jennifer Leigh.

Morrow wrote and directed a spaghetti Western, produced by Dino DeLaurentiis, titled &quot;A Man Called Sledge&quot; (1970) and starring James Garner, Dennis Weaver and Claude Akins. After &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, it was Morrow&#x27;s first and only big screen outing behind the camera. &quot;Sledge&quot; was filmed in Italy with desert-like settings that were highly evocative of the Southwestern United States.

Morrow guest starred in &quot;The Immortal&quot;, &quot;Dan August&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Sarge&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, and &quot;Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot;.

===TV movies===
In the 1970s Morrow starred in some television movies including &quot;A Step Out of Line&quot; (1971), &quot;Travis Logan, D.A.&quot; (1971) (playing the title role), &quot;River of Mystery&quot; (1971), &quot;The Glass House&quot; (1972), &quot;The Weekend Nun&quot;, &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; (1973), and &quot;Nightmare&quot; (1974).

He guest starred in &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors&quot;, , &quot;The FBI&quot;, &quot;Love Story&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, and &quot;Police Story&quot;.

Morrow appeared in two episodes of Australian-produced anthology series &quot;The Evil Touch&quot; (1973), one of which he also directed.

He played the wily local sheriff in director John Hough&#x27;s road classic &quot;Dirty Mary Crazy Larry&quot;, as well as the homicidal sheriff, alongside Martin Sheen, in the television film &quot;The California Kid&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Take&quot; (1974).

Morrow had the lead in &quot;Funeral for an Assassin&quot; (1975). He had key roles in &quot;Death Stalk&quot; (1975), &quot;&quot; (also called &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;; 1975), &quot;The Night That Panicked America&quot; (1975), &quot;Treasure of Matecumbe&quot; (1976) and had a key role as aggressive, competitive baseball coach Roy Turner, in the comedy &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; (1976).

In the late 1970s Morrow worked increasingly in miniseries such as &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; (1977), &quot;Roots&quot; and &quot;The Last Convertible&quot; (1979), as well as guest starring on shows like &quot;Bronc&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot; and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

He returned to directing, helming episodes of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; as well as &quot;Lucan&quot; and &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;.

===Final roles===
Morrow had the lead in &quot;The Ghost of Cypress Swamp&quot; (1977), the Japanese film &quot;Message from Space&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Evictors&quot; (1979). He was in TV movies &quot;The Man with the Power&quot; (1977), &quot;The Hostage Heart&quot; (1977), &quot;Curse of the Black Widow&quot; (1977), &quot;Wild and Wooly&quot; (1978), &quot;Stone&quot; (1979), and &quot;Paris&quot; (1980)

Morrow made &quot;Humanoids from the Deep&quot; (1980) for Roger Corman and &quot;The Last Shark&quot; (1981) and had a regular role in the series, &quot;B.A.D. Cats&quot; (1980).

Morrow&#x27;s last roles included guest roles in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and the films &quot;1990: The Bronx Warriors&quot; (1981) and &quot;Abenko Green Berets&quot; (1982).

==Personal life==
From 1957 to 1964, Morrow was married to actress and screenwriter Barbara Turner. They had two daughters, Carrie Ann Morrow and actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. He married Gale Lester in 1975; they separated just prior to Morrow&#x27;s death in July 1982. 

Morrow fell out with his daughter Jennifer after his divorce from her mother. She changed her last name to Leigh and they were still estranged at the time of his death.

Rick Jason, co-star of &quot;Combat!&quot;, wrote in his memoirs that Morrow &quot;had an absolute dislike of firearms. He used a Thompson submachine gun in our series, but that was work. In any other respect he&#x27;d have nothing to do with them.&quot;

==Death==

In 1982, Morrow was cast in a feature role in &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; in a segment directed by John Landis. Morrow was playing the role of Bill Connor, a racist who is taken back in time and placed in various situations where he would be a persecuted victim: as a Jewish man in Vichy France, a black man about to be lynched by the Ku Klux Klan and a Vietnamese man about to be killed by U.S. soldiers.

In the early morning hours of July 23, 1982, Morrow and two child actors, seven-year-old Myca Dinh Le and six-year-old Renee Shin-Yi Chen, were filming on location in California in an area that was known as Indian Dunes near Santa Clarita. They were performing a scene for the Vietnam sequence, in which their characters attempt to escape out of a deserted Vietnamese village from a pursuing U.S. Army helicopter. The helicopter was hovering about above them when the heat from special effect pyrotechnic explosions reportedly delaminated the rotor blades and caused the helicopter to plummet and crash on top of them, killing all three instantly. Morrow and Le were decapitated and mutilated by the helicopter rotor blades, while Chen was crushed by a helicopter skid.

Morrow&#x27;s daughters sued several parties for negligence and wrongful death and were each awarded an out-of-court settlement of $850,000 by Warner Bros. Studios. Landis and four other defendants, including the helicopter pilot Dorcey Wingo, were charged with involuntary manslaughter but were ultimately acquitted after a ten-month trial. The parents of Le and Chen also sued and settled out of court for $2 million each.

Morrow&#x27;s remains are interred in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Port Ellen distillery is located in Port Ellen on the isle of Islay, Scotland. 

Port Ellen distillery reopened in 2024 after being closed since 1983.

==History==
Port Ellen was established as a malt mill in 1825, and then developed as a distillery under John Ramsay from 1833 to 1892. The warehouses he built still exist and are listed buildings. 

The distillery was acquired by The Distillers Company (DCL) in 1925, was closed in 1930 and rebuilt in 1966/1967. It continued in production throughout the 1970s and was closed in 1983, although supplies of its single malt whisky are still available. 

When Port Ellen was closed in 1983, DCL did knock down some of the buildings, repurposed others, and destroyed the stills. The distillery houses a malting which continues to supply all Islay distilleries, as per an agreement signed in 1987. The dwindling stocks of Port Ellen whisky, due to the closing of the distillery, became a collectors item.

On 9 October 2017 Diageo, DCL successor, announced that the distillery would reopen in 2020, following a £35 million investment in re-opening both Port Ellen and also their closed Brora distillery in Sutherland, which also closed in 1983. Diageo suggested the first new release might be of a 12 year old expression, i.e., in 2032, but have left the door open for possibly earlier releases. On 8 May 2019, Diageo submitted plans to revive the distillery, and to build a new stillhouse. Diageo say they are going to considerable efforts to recreate as similar as possible new stills, and point to factory records from the 1980s, and have former Port Ellen employees working for them elsewhere on Islay to assist in an accurate recreation of the Port Ellen style.

The Distillery build is currently under the management of Alexander McDonald, an Islay resident with previous positions held in Kilchoman, Lagavulin and Caol Ila distillery. plans are for the distillery to reopen in 2023.

In 2022, a rare 1979 cask of Port Ellen whisky was auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s for £875,000. It was sold in a lot which included an artwork in Murano glass by artist and designer Ini Archibong. Diageo announced that five percent of the hammer price would be donated to support Care International&#x27;s work in Ukraine.

In 19 March 2024, Port Ellen distillery reopened 40 years after having been closed and undergoing a £185 million (US$235m) restoration.

<text>Gatun Lake () is a freshwater artificial lake to the south of Colón, Panama. At approximately above sea level, it forms a major part of the Panama Canal, carrying ships of their transit across the Isthmus of Panama. It was created June 27, 1913 when the gates of the spillway at Gatun Dam were closed. The water level was about above sea level and was expected to fill to operating levels in the next six months.

==Construction==

Created in 1913 by damming the Chagres River, Gatun Lake is a key part of the Panama Canal, providing the millions of litres of water necessary to operate its locks each time a ship passes through. When constructed, Gatun Lake was the largest artificial lake in the world. The impassable rainforest around the lake has been the best defense of the Panama Canal. Today these areas remain practically unscathed by human interference and are one of the few accessible areas where various native Central American animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat.

==Geography==

Gatun Lake covers about . The largest island in the lake is Barro Colorado Island, which was established for scientific study when the lake was formed, and is operated by the Smithsonian Institution. Many important scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here.

Gatun Lake also provides drinking water for Panama City and Colón.

===Fishing===

Angling is one of the primary recreational pursuits on Gatun Lake. Non-native peacock bass were accidentally introduced to Gatun Lake around 1967 by a local businessman, and have since flourished to become the dominant angling game fish in Gatun Lake. Locally called Sargento and believed to be the species &quot;Cichla pleiozona&quot;, these peacock bass originate from the Amazon, Rio Negro, and Orinoco river basins. Although considered a premier game fish in their natural range, the introduction of the peacock bass to Gatun Lake had devastating effects on the local species. According to a report by the Smithsonian, native fish populations in the lake still have not recovered. Only one quarter the number of native fish species were found in a sampling taken in 2016.

<doc id="641865" wikidata="Q48614" url="?curid=641865" title="Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk (opera)">
<text>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, Op. 29 () is an opera in four acts and nine scenes by Dmitri Shostakovich. The libretto, jointly written by Alexander Preys and the composer, is based on the novella &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; by Nikolai Leskov.

Dedicated by Shostakovich to his first wife, physicist Nina Varzar, the roughly 160-minute opera was first performed on 22 January 1934 at the Leningrad Maly Operny, and two days later in Moscow. It incorporates elements of expressionism and verismo, telling the story of a lonely woman in 19th-century Russia who falls in love with one of her husband&#x27;s workers and is driven to murder.

==Performance history==

Despite early success on popular and official levels, &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; became the vehicle for a general denunciation of Shostakovich&#x27;s music by the CPSU in early 1936: after being condemned in an anonymous article (sometimes attributed to Joseph Stalin but actually authored by David Zaslavsky) in &quot;Pravda&quot;, titled &quot;Muddle Instead of Music&quot;, it was banned in the Soviet Union for almost thirty years, until 1961.

The composer in 1962 revised &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot;, renaming it Katerina Izmailova () and assigning it his Opus 114. He replaced two of its intermezzos, adjusted act 1, scene 3, and made smaller changes elsewhere. &quot;Katerina Izmailova&quot; was first performed on 26 December 1962 in Moscow at the Stanislavski-Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre, and first given a studio recording in 1964. But since Shostakovich&#x27;s death the original version has been more often performed. The original uncensored version was not performed again in Russia until 2000.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
Although the opera shares the basic characters and outline of the book, it has a number of differences from the original story in terms of plot and emphasis. One example is in the convoy after Katerina gives Sergei her stockings: in the opera, all the women mock Katerina, whereas in the story, Sergei and Sonya mock her while Fiona and Gordyushka shame them in response to their cruelty toward her.

===Act 1===

&quot;Scene 1: Katerina&#x27;s room&quot;

Katerina is unhappily married to Zinovy, a provincial flour-merchant. She complains to herself of her loneliness. Her father-in-law, Boris, angered at her response to his saying that mushrooms are his favourite dish, says that her loneliness is her fault due to her not producing an heir. She replies that Zinovy cannot give her a child – which Boris disdains; he then threatens her if she decides to accept some youthful lover. Zinovy is called away on business, and Boris – against his son&#x27;s inclinations – makes Katerina swear before an icon to be faithful. A servant, Aksinya, tells Katerina about the womanising new clerk, Sergei.

&quot;Scene 2: The Izmailovs&#x27; yard&quot;

Sergei and his comrades are sexually harassing Aksinya. Katerina intervenes. She berates him for his machismo and asserts that women are as brave and capable as men. Sergei is willing to prove her wrong and they wrestle; she is thrown down and Sergei falls on top of her. Boris appears. She says that she tripped and Sergei, in trying to help her, fell down also. The other peasants back her up. Boris however is suspicious and roars at the peasants, telling them to get back to work, before ordering Katerina to fry some mushrooms for him and threatening to tell Zinovy about her behaviour.

&quot;Scene 3: Katerina&#x27;s room&quot;

Katerina prepares to go to bed. Sergei knocks on her door with the excuse that he wants to borrow a book because he cannot sleep, but Katerina has none; she cannot read. As she is about to close the door, he attempts to seduce her by remembering their wrestling match earlier that day. He gets into the room and forces himself on her. Afterwards, she tells him to leave, but he refuses and she agrees to embark on an affair with him. Boris knocks on the door and confirms that Katerina is in bed and locks her in. Sergei is trapped in the room, and the two make love again.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 4: The yard&quot;

One night a week later.
Boris, unable to sleep due to unease about thieves, is walking in the courtyard in the pre-dawn darkness. He, remembering his days as a young rake and knowing Zinovy&#x27;s low libido, is considering seducing Katerina himself to fulfill his son&#x27;s marital duties. He spots Sergei climbing out of Katerina&#x27;s window. He catches him and publicly whips him as a burglar, then has him locked up. Katerina witnesses this but cannot stop this because she remains locked in her room. When she eventually manages to climb down the eavestrough-drainpipe, the other servants restrain her on Boris&#x27; order. After being exhausted by beating Sergei, Boris demands a meal, saying that he will whip Sergei again the next day and dispatches a servant to recall Zinovy, saying that Zinovy is to be told that there&#x27;s trouble at home. Katerina adds rat-poison to some mushrooms and gives them to him. As he is dying, calling for a priest, she retrieves the keys to free Sergei. The priest, called by the arriving morning shift of workers who find Boris in agony, arrives: Boris vainly tries to tell him that he was poisoned and falls back dead pointing at Katerina. Katerina, weeping crocodile tears, convinces the priest that Boris has accidentally eaten poisonous mushrooms and he says a prayer over Boris&#x27; body.

&quot;Scene 5: Katerina&#x27;s room&quot;

Katerina and Sergei are together. Sergei querulously says that their affair will have to end due to Zinovy&#x27;s impending return and that he wishes that he and Katerina could marry – Katerina assures him that they&#x27;ll marry but refuses to tell him how she&#x27;ll arrange it. Sergei then falls asleep; Katerina is then tormented by Boris&#x27; ghost and cannot sleep. Later, she hears Zinovy returning. He has been called back by one of the servants with the news of his father&#x27;s death. Although Sergei hides, Zinovy sees his trousers and belt and guesses the truth. As he and Katerina quarrel, he whips her with the belt. Hearing Katerina&#x27;s cries, Sergei emerges and confronts Zinovy, who then tries to escape to call the servants. Katerina stops Zinovy: she and Sergei then proceed to strangle him; he is finally finished off by Sergei with a blow on the head with a heavy candlestick. The lovers hide the corpse in the wine-cellar.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 6: Near the cellar&quot;

Following Zinovy&#x27;s disappearance, he has been presumed dead. Katerina and Sergei prepare to get married, but she is tormented by the fact that Zinovy&#x27;s corpse is hidden in the wine cellar. Sergei reassures her and they leave for the wedding ceremony. A drunken peasant breaks into the cellar, finds Zinovy&#x27;s body and goes to fetch the police.

&quot;Scene 7: The police station&quot;

The police are complaining about not being invited to the wedding and vainly try to distract themselves by tormenting a socialist schoolteacher because of his alleged atheism when the peasant arrives and gives them the opportunity for revenge.

&quot;Scene 8: The Izmailov garden&quot;

Everyone is drunk at the wedding. Katerina sees that the cellar door is open, but the police arrive as she and Sergei are trying to escape.

===Act 4===
&quot;Scene 9. A temporary convict camp near a bridge&quot;

On the way to katorga in Siberia, Katerina bribes a guard to allow her to meet Sergei. He blames her for everything. After she leaves, Sergei tries to seduce another convict, Sonyetka. She demands a pair of stockings as her price. Sergei tricks Katerina into giving him hers, whereupon he gives them to Sonyetka. Sonyetka and the other convicts taunt Katerina, who pushes Sonyetka into an icy river – also, herself, falling in. They are swept away and the convict train moves on.

==Critical reactions==
One criticism of the work focused on its sexual content, particularly the way in which the action is depicted in the music. A 1935 review in the &quot;New York Sun&quot; called it &quot;pornophony&quot;, referring to the lurid descriptive music in the sex scenes. Stravinsky described the opera as &quot;lamentably provincial&quot;, considering the musical portrayal primitively realistic.

The thrust of the &quot;Pravda&quot; criticism was in terms of morality; it condemned the opera&#x27;s sympathetic portrayal of the eponymous character, an adulteress and murderess. At the time, the composer justified the sympathetic portrayal of Katerina in Soviet terms, saying she was a victim of the circumstances of oppressive, pre-revolutionary Russia.

This criticism was revived in a different way by Richard Taruskin in a 1989 article, where he interprets the work in the context of Stalin&#x27;s campaign against the kulaks in 1930, considering its portrayal of the killings of Katerina&#x27;s kulak in-laws as &quot;a justification of genocide&quot; (despite neither the opera nor the original story containing any kulaks). Daniel Zhitomirsky accused the work of &quot;primitive satire&quot; in its treatment of the priest and police, but acknowledges the &quot;incredible force&quot; of the last scene.

<text>Bowmore distillery ( , ) is a Islay single malt Scotch whisky distillery located on the Isle of Islay, an island of the Inner Hebrides. 

The distillery, which lies on the South Eastern shore of Loch Indaal, is one of the oldest in Scotland. It is said to have been established in 1779 and is the oldest running distillery on Islay. The distillery is owned by Morrison Bowmore Distillers Ltd, a holding company owned by Suntory Global Spirits, a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Osaka, Japan. Morrison Bowmore also own the Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch distilleries and produce the McClelland&#x27;s Single Malt range of bottlings.

==History==

The Bowmore Distillery was established in 1779 by a local merchant, John P. Simson, before passing into the ownership of the Mutter family, a family of German descent. James Mutter, head of the family, also had farming interests and was Vice Consul representing the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, and Brazil through their Glasgow consulates. There are no records that pinpoint the date Mutter acquired the distillery from Simpson. Mutter would introduce a number of innovative processes to the distillery during his tenure and even had a small iron steam ship built to import barley and coal from the mainland and to export the whisky to Glasgow. A bottle of 1850 Bowmore Single Malt was sold at an auction in September 2007 for £29,400.

The distillery was closed in 1915 until it was bought from the Mutter family in 1925 by &quot;J.B. Sheriff &amp; Co.&quot; and remained under their ownership until being purchased by Inverness-based &quot;William Grigor &amp; Son, Ltd.&quot; in 1950.

During the World Wars the Bowmore Distillery halted production, and hosted the RAF Coastal Command for much of World War II, Coastal Command operated flying boats from Loch Indaal on anti-submarine warfare missions.

Stanley P. Morrison and James Howat formed &quot;Stanley P. Morrison Ltd.&quot; in 1951, and this company formed &quot;Morrison&#x27;s Bowmore Distillery, Ltd.&quot; in 1963 in order to take over the Bowmore Distillery. Stanley P. Morrison died in 1971, and control of the companies passed to Brian Morrison. 

In 1994 the Japanese distiller Suntory bought Morrison Bowmore Distillers Ltd. Suntory had previously been a shareholder in Morrison Bowmore for several years.

In August 2024, Bowmore distillery unveils an updated bottle design and two new ranges.

==Production==

Bowmore Distillery sources as much barley as possible from on the island of Islay, but there are insufficient quantities produced to satisfy the distillery&#x27;s demand, so barley is also imported from the mainland. The distillery retains a traditional floor malting, but this also lacks sufficient capacity; the barley imported from the mainland is normally already malted.

The distillery has an annual capacity of two million litres, with fermentation undertaken in traditional wooden washbacks before the liquid is passed through two wash stills and then through two spirit stills.

The waste heat from the distillation process goes to heat a nearby public swimming pool that was built in one of the distillery&#x27;s former warehouses.

Morrison Bowmore bottles all whisky produced at Bowmore Distillery and their other distilleries at a facility in Springburn, Glasgow.

<text>The Midland Highway (also known as the Midlands Highway) is one of Tasmania&#x27;s major inter-city highways, running for between Hobart and Launceston. It is part of the AusLink National Network and is a vital link for road freight to transport goods to and from the two cities.
It represents a major north–south transportation corridor in Tasmania and has the route 1 designation as part of the National Highway.
The highway consists of various traffic lane arrangements, the most common being two lanes – one in each direction, with overtaking options and at-grade intersections. At both the Launceston and Hobart sections of the highway there are small portions of grade-separated dual carriageway.

==History==

Surveyor Grimes marked out the track from Hobart to Launceston in 1807, and Governor Macquarie followed the route in 1811 when he visited the colony accompanied by his wife. The party took five and a half days to complete the journey.

Macquarie again visited the colony in 1821, when the road was fit for a carriage, but his journal records many different sections, and it was not until 1831 that the first regular coach service was operated by J. E. Cox.

The first mailman, Robert Taylor, was appointed in 1816, he walked, leaving Hobart and Launceston on alternate Sundays and carrying the mail in a pack.

The first record of movement between the two centres was in 1821 when then Governor Lachlan Macquarie selected sites for towns on the highway.

It was known as the &quot;Main Road&quot; or &quot;Hobart Road&quot; for most of its history. In the 1930s it became known as the Midland Highway, and in the 2000s - it also had &quot;The Heritage Highway&quot; label applied to it.

The route of the highway originally ran between Hobart and Launceston, and passed through the localities which are now known as:
Bridgewater, Brighton, Pontville, Mangalore, Bagdad, Dysart, Kempton, Melton Mowbray, Jericho, Oatlands, Antill Ponds, Woodbury, Tunbridge, Ross, Campbell Town, Conara Junction, Cleveland, Epping Forest, Perth, Breadalbane and Kings Meadows.

==Recent upgrades==

A number of two lane bypasses of towns and villages have been constructed since the early 1980s, including the Jericho bypass, which was opened to traffic in January 1982.

Construction of grade separated dual carriageways leading south of Launceston and north of Hobart provided new superior facilities for Midland Highway traffic and shortened the route officially designated the Midland Highway.

On 21 June 1983, what was then referred to as the &quot;Hobart Northern Outlet Road&quot; was opened to traffic. Now called the Brooker Highway, this completed a grade-separated dual carriageway between Claremont Interchange and Granton in the northern suburbs of Hobart.

Construction of the first stage of the Launceston Southern Outlet between Glen Dhu and Strathroy commenced in February 1981 and comprised the construction of 7.4 km of dual carriageway and included three major bridges, namely the Mt Pleasant Interchange, the Westbury Road Overpass and the Glen Dhu Overpass. The highway opened to traffic between the Glen Dhu interchange and the temporary connection onto the old Midland Highway at Jinglers Creek, Strathroy.
The extension of the Launceston Southern Outlet Road between Breadalbane and Strathroy opened to traffic on 28 August 1987. This extension included the construction of 3.7 km of dual carriageway and a roundabout, linking the Outlet Road with the Midland Highway and Evandale Main Road.
The third and final section of the Launceston Southern Outlet opened to traffic on 24 May 1988. The road works involved construction of 1 km of dual carriageway between Glen Dhu Overpass and the Frankland Street/Wellington Street intersection.

In October 2012, the Brighton Bypass was officially opened, six months ahead of schedule. This bypass is a grade separated dual carriageway of the towns of Brighton and Pontville, just beyond Hobart’s northern suburbs. The total cost of the bypass was A$191 million.

On 16 April 2020, the second and final stage of the Perth Link Roads project was officially completed over 3 years ahead of schedule, including the opening of the long-overdue bypass of Perth. The bypass consists of 4.5 km of dual carriageway, including a grade separated interchange with Illawarra Road, an interchange consisting of two roundabouts north of the Perth, and a roundabout south of the town centre, near the South Esk River bridge. Stage 1 of the project was completed in April 2018, including a new grade separated interchange at Breadalbane to bypass the existing roundabout which provides connections with Launceston Airport, Evandale and the old Midland Highway alignment to Youngtown and Kings Meadows. A new dual carriageway alignment was also constructed alongside the existing highway to connect the new Breadalbane interchange with the Perth bypass.

In 2002, a railway line underpass was constructed near Symmons Plains, south of Perth, to create a grade separated rail crossing on the highway itself. Significant numbers of overtaking lanes have also been extended or created.

==Future==
There has been mounting pressure for the Highway to be upgraded to a four-lane carriageway for 20 years to fall in line with the Auslink network of highways such as the Hume and Pacific as it is Tasmania&#x27;s most heavily travelled stretch of long highway.

The State and federal Liberal Parties have pledged $400 million to the funding of a dual-carriageway highway between Hobart and Launceston. The Liberal Party&#x27;s claim is that when taking into account the Brighton Bypass, the Southern Outlet and the 34 km of overtaking lanes, there are of single-carriageway road on the Midland Highway. The Australian Labor Party stated that the 400 million-dollar budget is grossly underfunded, and could not possibly be constructed for that price.

The Liberal Party defended the accusations that the $3 million/km budget is too low by stating that they are not planning any new road alignments or bypasses, just adding new lanes to the existing alignment. They have not stated if they plan to include grade separation or T-junctions and roundabouts. Should both the federal and state Liberal Parties win the next elections, they plan to upgrade this remaining stretch of road from 2014 progressively.

Currently, there are several projects/proposals;

===Brighton===

The bypass on the southern stretch of the Highway was recently opened as part of the Southern Transport Investment Program, A transport masterplan for the southern part of the Highway. The transport study also caters for the Bagdad Bypass and the replacement of the ageing Bridgewater Bridge

===Perth===
The Perth Bypass is proposed to be constructed in 2 stages starting with the South Perth bypass which will result in a direct route to Illawarra Main Road - a vital link road to the Bass Highway. There are also plans to duplicate the Midland Highway Between Perth and Launceston.

<doc id="641891" wikidata="Q7230139" url="?curid=641891" title="Pork roll">
<text>Pork roll is a processed meat commonly available in New Jersey and neighboring states.
It was developed in 1856 by John Taylor of Trenton, and sold as &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Prepared Ham&quot; until 1906.
Though since then food labeling regulations require Taylor and all other manufacturers to label it &quot;pork roll&quot;, people in northern New Jersey still refer to it as &quot;Taylor ham&quot;.
The &quot;Is it pork roll or Taylor ham?&quot; question is a notable element of New Jersey culture, and the division over what name one uses divides the state along roughly north–south geographic regions. A 2016 reader poll including more than 70,000 respondents from all 565 municipalities across New Jersey found that the dividing line straddled the Union–Middlesex county border in the east and followed Interstate 78 through the middle of Somerset and Hunterdon counties in the west.

== Origin ==

Food preservation techniques, such as salting and smoking meat, have been practiced for millennia. Evidence of traditional ham and sausage production dates back more than 2,000 years. An item resembling pork roll, packed minced ham, may have been locally produced in the later 1700s. 

John Taylor is credited with creating his secret recipe for the product in 1856. George Washington Case, a farmer and butcher from nearby Belle Mead, created his own recipe for hickory-smoked pork roll in 1870.
Case&#x27;s was reportedly packaged in corn husks.

Following the Civil War, in the later 1800s, the American meat-packing industry experienced dramatic growth, bringing meat products like pork roll to rapidly growing urban areas.

== Description ==
Being both a regional specialty and a processed meat with a unique taste, pork roll has resisted accurate description and is sometimes referred to as a mystery meat.
It contains lightly smoked pork, salt, preservative, and spices.
The exact recipes, both Taylor&#x27;s and Case&#x27;s, have remained trade secrets.

The 1910 legal opinion which established &quot;pork roll&quot; as a generic term described the product as:

Both the &quot;cylindrical cotton sack&quot; and vacuum-sealed sliced forms are widely available in the region.
Loeffler&#x27;s Gourmet sold a &quot;Pork Roll Links&quot; product under its Mercer Meats brand, which was in essence a hot dog made of pork roll.
For some time, Taylor also made &quot;Taystrips&quot;, which was the same kind of meat, but shaped into rectangular strips, similar to bacon or sizzlean.

Larry Olmsted of &quot;USA Today&quot; has described the taste of the meat as &quot;a cross between Canadian bacon and bacon, less hammy and smoky than Canadian, fattier and saltier than bacon, with a unique texture, both crispy and slightly mushy.&quot;
Bryson and Haynie wrote &quot;Think Spam, but pork roll is leaner, has a hint of smoke, subtly different spices — and it doesn&#x27;t have the goo or come in a can.&quot;

== Preparation ==
Pork roll is prepared by slicing it, if it is not already sliced, and then frying, searing, or griddling the slices.

Slices of pork roll naturally curl up into a cup shape as they are heated. To make the slices lie flat, a single radial cut (Pac-Man style) or four inward cuts (fireman&#x27;s badge style) are commonly made, leading to distinctive shapes once cooked.

Pork roll is typically eaten as part of a sandwich and frequently paired with egg and/or cheese. A popular breakfast sandwich in the region is the &quot;Taylor ham, egg and cheese&quot; a.k.a. &quot;pork roll, egg and cheese&quot; in which fried pork roll is joined with a fried (or scrambled) egg and American cheese and served on a hard roll, bagel, or English muffin.

It is also eaten in many other ways, such as Taylor ham burgers (pork roll with beef on a burger bun), Taylor ham pancakes, and local items such as the &quot;Shamewich&quot; sold by a retailer in Montclair which is a pork roll, egg, and cheese sandwich with the bread replaced by buttermilk pancakes.

Other recipes that it is incorporated into include the &quot;Jersey Burger&quot;, a pork roll Monte Cristo, or a variation on deviled eggs.

== Names of the product ==
Taylor originally called his product &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Prepared Ham&quot;, but was forced to change the name after it failed to meet the new legal definition of &quot;ham&quot; established by the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.

Marketed as both &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Pork Roll&quot; and &quot;Trenton Pork Roll&quot;, it saw competition from products with similar names like &quot;Rolled Pork&quot; and &quot;Trenton style Pork Roll&quot;. Adolph Gobel, the &quot;Sausage King&quot; of Brooklyn, was sued by Taylor in 1910 for calling his competing product &quot;Roll of Pork&quot;, but the court ruled that the words &quot;Pork Roll&quot; and &quot;Roll of Pork&quot; could not be trademarked.

=== New Jersey split over the name ===
Although it says &quot;John Taylor&#x27;s Pork Roll&quot; on the wrapper of the product of the Taylor Provisions Company, a century later, many in North Jersey continue to use the term &quot;Taylor ham&quot;. The debate over the name, which splits New Jersey along a line between the north and the south, is a perennial one in the state. It has become a shibboleth for identity within the state.

On May 15, 2016, President Barack Obama gave a commencement speech at Rutgers University&#x27;s 250th graduation ceremony in which he referenced the &quot;Taylor Ham vs. pork roll debate&quot;, saying, &quot;I come here for a simple reason – to finally settle this pork roll vs. Taylor Ham question...I&#x27;m just kidding...There&#x27;s not much I&#x27;m afraid to take on in my final year of office, but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate.&quot;

A 2014 survey of restaurant menus by documentary filmmaker Steve Chernoski found that the north–south dividing line was not quite as characterized, with restaurants in Monmouth County using the name &quot;Taylor ham&quot;, which Chernoski hypothesized was the result of either northerners moving to beachfront properties, or restaurants catering to their tourist markets; a &quot;Down the Shore Taylor Ham&quot; product being sold south of Driscoll Bridge; and the main split being further south than Chernoski expected it to be, in Somerset and Middlesex Counties around the Raritan River.

Further confounding the debate is the fact that items sold in restaurants as &quot;Taylor ham&quot; are not necessarily the Taylor product, because it has suffered from a degree of genericization, and even in northern New Jersey are likely to be in fact a pork roll product of Case or another company. For example, any pork roll sandwich bought in any Wawa store is made from pork roll manufactured by Alderfer.

== Producers ==

The main producers of pork roll in New Jersey are Taylor Provisions (USDA EST 256), branded as Taylor and Trenton, and Case Pork Roll (USDA EST 184), branded as Case&#x27;s.
Both these two have their headquarters in Trenton.

Other smaller producers include Spolem Provisions (USDA EST 5421) branded as Loeffler&#x27;s Gourmet and Mercer Meats, Clemens Food Group (USDA EST 791) as Hatfield, Leidys (USDA EST 9520) as Leidy&#x27;s and Alderfer, and Rob-Dave Distributors (USDA EST 2159) as Johnston.

Both Loeffler/Spoelm and Johnston House/Rob-Dave are produced in Hamilton Township, which borders Trenton. Loeffler Gourmet is a small business that got into selling pork roll in 2003, after its manager Robert Trofimowicz, a Polish immigrant, and his parents had been running a Polish delicatessen named Henry&#x27;s Deli in Hamilton.
Originally one of the delicatessen&#x27;s suppliers, Trofimowicz bought the business and started marketing its pork roll.
As of 2012, it was contracting with 300 of New Jersey&#x27;s school districts for supply of pork roll. Johnston House Brand Pork Roll is produced from a family butcher&#x27;s shop near Allentown, New Jersey, and is named for the avenue in Hamilton where the owners&#x27; family previously ran a butcher shop.

Clemens/Hatfield and Leidy/Alderfelder are based in nearby Pennsylvania, approximately 30 miles west of Trenton. Their products are named specifically a &quot;Pork Roll Sausage&quot;, adding the word &quot;sausage&quot;, because of food labeling laws.

There is an industry of delivering pork roll by mail order from New Jersey to the rest of the United States, as it is little known and otherwise not readily obtainable outside New Jersey and neighboring Pennsylvania, with companies ranging from &quot;The Taylor Ham Man&quot; through &quot;Jersey Pork Roll&quot; to &quot;Case&#x27;s Pork Roll Store&quot;. Conflating the names, the Jersey Pork Roll company sells a product named &quot;Original Taylor Ham Pork Roll&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Many people from New Jersey have strong feelings for the product.
It rivals their feelings about pizza or bagels, but unlike those foods, pork roll is a food that is highly specific to the state. When food writer Peter Genovese wrote an article entitled the &quot;10 Most Overrated Things about New Jersey&quot; and put pork roll on the list, saying merely that it was overrated, he received a large amount of negative feedback from readers.

=== Festivals ===
There are three festivals of pork rolls in Trenton. The first of several Pork Roll Festivals was held on May 24, 2014.
At the festival, held at Trenton Social bar and restaurant, hundreds of pounds of pork roll were served to over 4,000 visitors and a Miss Pork Roll Queen was crowned.

Pre-ordered supplies for sandwich making ran out partway through the event, and Tom Dolan, the president of Case Pork Roll, personally delivered a further 20 cases of pork roll to keep vendors supplied. The organizers had spent a total of $50 on advertising, the publicity being mainly through Facebook posts and word of mouth.

The following year, the organizers split up over a disagreement as to where the festival was to be held and whether Trenton Social was large enough to accommodate the expected visitor numbers, and held competing festivals. The renamed Trenton Pork Roll Festival remained at Trenton Social, whilst the originally named Pork Roll Festival was held in Mill Hill Park. Both rivals were still going in 2016.

The 7th annual Pork Roll festival was scheduled for 2020, but was delayed and ultimately cancelled due to the COVID pandemic.

A Vegan Pork Roll Festival was held in 2015, on the same day as the other two, in Gandhi Garden on Trenton&#x27;s East Hanover Street.

=== State sandwich ===
Unofficially, many residents of New Jersey regard the &quot;Taylor ham/pork roll, egg, and cheese&quot; as the state sandwich.

On April 14, 2016, Assemblyman Tim Eustace introduced two bills in the New Jersey State Legislature seeking to make this official, designating it the New Jersey State Sandwich. One bill was for pork roll and one for Taylor Ham. Neither bill made it out of committee.

On May 25, 2023, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy declared the official sandwich of New Jersey to be the &quot;Taylor Swift Ham, Egg, and Cheese&quot; in honor of Taylor Swift&#x27;s Eras Tour coming to East Rutherford&#x27;s Metlife Stadium in the following weekend.

=== Others ===
The Trenton Thunder minor league baseball team hosted their inaugural &quot;Trenton Thunder World Famous Case&#x27;s Pork Roll Eating Championship&quot; on September 26, 2015. Joey Chestnut won the contest by eating 32 pork roll sandwiches in 10 minutes. On Fridays in 2018, the team rebranded itself as &quot;Thunder Pork Roll&quot; with pork roll themed uniforms and merchandise.
The Jersey Shore BlueClaws minor league baseball team holds a Pork Roll, Egg, and Cheese Race at the end of the fourth inning of every home game.

Several songs by the band Ween contain references to pork roll, including &quot;Frank&quot; and &quot;Pork Roll Egg and Cheese&quot; from their 1991 album &quot;The Pod&quot;. The band is from nearby New Hope, Pennsylvania.

Episode 9 from Season 7 of the television program &quot;Bizarre Foods Delicious Destinations&quot; featured pork roll as a Jersey Shore specialty.

On October 28, 2020, Montana gubernatorial candidate Mike Cooney released a video of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie on the app Cameo. Christie, who had been tricked into recording the video by a Cooney aide, invoked &quot;Taylor ham&quot; in an attempt to lure Cooney&#x27;s opponent, Greg Gianforte, back to New Jersey.

<doc id="641894" wikidata="Q621073" url="?curid=641894" title="D12 World">
<text>D12 World is the second and final studio album by American hip-hop group D12, released on April 27, 2004. The album sold 544,000 copies in its first week on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album is also the last D12 release to feature Proof before his death in 2006, and the second D12 album to feature Bugz on a track.

==Background==
In memory of Bugz, who was killed prior to a concert on May 21, 1999, the group recorded the track &quot;Good Die Young&quot; in memory of him. The album also includes a skit entitled &quot;Bugz &#x27;97&quot;, which is a 1997 recording of Bugz, originally taken from the song &quot;Desperados&quot;. The group was often overshadowed by Eminem&#x27;s massive success, and as such, the group toured without him for promotion of the album (but the album still reached the top of the US Billboard chart). At the time, Eminem was busy recording &quot;Encore&quot;. Although shadowed by Eminem&#x27;s success, members Bizarre and Proof managed to prevail with mildly successful solo careers following &quot;D12 World&quot;, with the releases of &quot;Hannicap Circus&quot; and &quot;Searching for Jerry Garcia&quot;, respectively, in 2005. Before the album&#x27;s release, &quot;6 in the Morning&quot; was featured on Eminem&#x27;s 2003 mixtape &quot;Straight from the Lab&quot; and was entitled &quot;Come On In&quot;. Group member Kuniva stated in a podcast that most of Denaun&#x27;s verses were recorded in his home studio as opposed to with the rest of the group, due to frequent arguments with Proof.

==Production==
The album was executively produced by Eminem, who also handled most of the audio production for the album along with Denaun Porter, Dr. Dre, Essman, Hi-Tek, Kanye West, Luis Resto, Mike Elizondo, Night &amp; Day, Red Spyda, Trackboyz and Witt &amp; Pep. Guest appearances on the album included Obie Trice, Dina Rae, Young Zee and B-Real.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;D12 World&quot; debuted at the top of the US, UK, Irish, Canadian, Australian and NZ albums charts. It debuted at number 2 in Germany and also in the top 5 in Switzerland and Norway. It debuted in the top 10 in Sweden, Denmark, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

It sold about 544,000 records in its first week of release in the United States alone. Debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album ended the first five-week run of singer Usher&#x27;s best-selling album, &quot;Confessions&quot;. On the week of May 22, 2004, Usher&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; regained the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200&#x27;s number-one spot, sending &quot;D12 World&quot; to number two. The album went on to have the best performing first-week sales for a hip hop release of that year until the release of Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Encore&quot; that November. Ultimately the album was certified double platinum, having a twenty-eight week stay on the chart overall.

The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with approximately 76,666 copies sold during the first week of release. Ultimately the album was certified platinum; total sales of the album stand at 323,649 as of December 2017.

&quot;My Band&quot;, the first single, was also successful, reaching number one in Australia and on the US Rhythmic Top 40, the Top 5 in the UK and Germany, and Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Critical reception==

Upon release, &quot;D12 World&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 58, based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

<doc id="641899" wikidata="Q4792454" url="?curid=641899" title="Trenton Thunder Ballpark">
<text>Trenton Thunder Ballpark, formerly known as Mercer County Waterfront Park and Arm &amp; Hammer Park, is a ballpark in Trenton, New Jersey. It is the home park for the Trenton Thunder, a collegiate summer baseball team of the MLB Draft League. They were previously a Double-A level Minor League Baseball team of the Eastern League (1994–2020). For 2021, it served as temporary home of Triple-A East&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons, as their regular stadium, Sahlen Field, was being used by the Toronto Blue Jays due to travel restrictions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The official seating capacity is 6,440.

==History==
The park was built for the 1994 season, although it opened several weeks late due to a rough winter that hampered construction. The sod also was unable to take properly that season, and the field did not properly drain, leading to rainouts on evenings where the sun had been out since noon. The drainage problem was fixed in 1995.

The stadium&#x27;s original name was &quot;Mercer County Waterfront Park&quot; when it opened in 1994. &quot;Samuel J. Plumeri Sr. Field&quot; was added to the original name in 1999 by Trenton Thunder owner, Joe Plumeri (Chairman and CEO of Willis Group Holdings). Samuel J. Plumeri Sr. was Joe Plumeri&#x27;s father. In November 2012, the New Jersey–based Church and Dwight company / Arm &amp; Hammer purchased the ballpark&#x27;s naming rights. Following the 2020 season the sponsorship was discontinued as the professional minor league Thunder lost their affiliation as part of the 2021 reorganization of Minor League Baseball.

On July 8, 1996, the ballpark hosted the Double-A All-Star Game in which a team of National League-affiliated All-Stars defeated a team of American League-affiliated All-Stars, 6–2, before 8,369 people in attendance.

In June 2014, the park hosted the first-ever, gold- and bronze-medal games in baseball for the Special Olympics USA National Games. In 2018, it hosted the Eastern League All-Star Game.

===Attendance records===
The ballpark set a record for game attendance on July 3, 2011, when the Thunder played the Altoona Curve. The game had the fortune of falling on the Independence Day holiday weekend, as well as featuring an injury rehabilitation appearance by Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees, the Thunder&#x27;s major league affiliate at the time. The official attendance for the game was 9,212.

When Alex Rodriguez played two games on back-to-back nights in August 2013, the official attendance was reported at 8,080 and 8,113, respectively.

==Features==

While the outfield in left and center field is covered with advertising signs that obscure views of Route 29 and nearby houses, the right field fence was kept as a short structure so that fans could see the Delaware River and Pennsylvania beyond. The river is also an inviting target for left-handed sluggers, several of whom have deposited baseballs into the water. Similar to Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio and its river border with Kentucky, the ballpark also holds the possibility of having someone &quot;hit one out of the state&quot; since the middle of the Delaware River is the border with Pennsylvania.

On June 7, 1994, Tony Clark became the first player to hit a fair ball into the Delaware.

The stadium anchors an area of rejuvenation in Trenton that also includes office buildings, nightclubs, and the CURE Insurance Arena, several blocks away, for ice hockey, basketball and arena football.

<text>The Bay at the Back of the Ocean (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Camas Cuil an t-Saimh&quot;) is a wide, west facing bay on the island of Iona, Argyll and Bute, Scotland, and is so named because the next westward stop is North America.

Behind the beach is the machair, a wide grassed area that houses communal sheep grazing for the island, and the local golf course. It is the half-way point of the most popular walk on the island.

<doc id="641906" wikidata="Q3523788" url="?curid=641906" title="Hawaiian kinship">
<text>Hawaiian kinship, also referred to as the generational system, is a kinship terminology system used to define family within languages. Identified by Lewis H. Morgan in his 1871 work &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot;, the Hawaiian system is one of the six major kinship systems (Inuit, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese).

==Kinship system==

Within common typologies, the Hawaiian system is the simplest classificatory system of kinship. Relatives are distinguished only by generation and by gender. There is a parental generation and a generation of children. In this system, a person (called &quot;Ego&quot; in anthropology) refers to all females of his parents&#x27; generation (mother, aunts, and the wives of men in this generation) as &quot;Mother&quot; and all of the males (father, uncles, and husbands of the women in this generation) as &quot;Father&quot;. In the generation of children, all brothers and male cousins are referred to as &quot;Brother&quot;, and all sisters and female cousins as &quot;Sister&quot;.

In this way, a cross-cousin will be referred to as a &quot;sibling&quot;. A correlation was found between the Hawaiian system and the prohibition of cross‐cousin marriage, as the incest taboo is reflected in the semantics.

==Usage==
The Hawaiian system is named for the pre-contact kinship system of Native Hawaiian people in the Hawaiian Islands. Today, the Hawaiian system is most common among Malayo-Polynesian-speaking cultures; the Hawaiian language itself is Malayo-Polynesian.

This system is usually associated with ambilineal descent groups, where economic production and child-rearing are shared between the genders. The Hawaiian system is found in approximately one-third of the world&#x27;s societies, although usually small societies.

<text>GLX (initialism for &quot;OpenGL Extension to the X Window System&quot;) is an extension to the X Window System core protocol providing an interface between OpenGL and the X Window System as well as extensions to OpenGL itself. It enables programs wishing to use OpenGL to do so within a window provided by the X Window System. GLX distinguishes two &quot;states&quot;: indirect state and direct state.

==History==
Silicon Graphics developed GLX as part of their effort to support OpenGL in the X Window System. In 1999 SGI released GLX under an open-source license, letting it be incorporated in XFree86 source code version 4.0 in 2000. From there, the code was inherited by the forked X.Org Foundation version of the X Window System X11R6.7.0. On September 19, 2008, SGI created a new SGI FreeB License Version 2.0, which &quot;now mirrors the free X11 license used by X.Org&quot; and &quot;meets the free and open source software community&#x27;s widely accepted definition of &#x27;free&#x27;&quot;. In 2009 the Free Software Foundation endorsed the SGI Free License B to be a free-software license, and GLX to be an important free-software graphics project. As of 2011, GLX has reached version 1.4.

The first internal implementation of GLX API, called GLcore, loaded a version of the software renderer of Mesa inside the X server and rendered the OpenGL commands in a window or pixmap. With the development of DRI, the ability to use hardware accelerated OpenGL through direct contexts was added (primarily used by videogames). In 2006, the popularization of the nested Xgl X server and Compiz compositing window manager lead to the development of Accelerated Indirect GLX (AIGLX). AIGLX brings hardware acceleration to the GLX (indirect context) applications by loading the Mesa DRI driver inside the X server. This method enables the sharing of GL objects between X clients using indirect contexts (they all are in the same address space in the X server) and also between a X client and the compositing window manager, thus accelerating composition. In 2008 the binding in GLcore to the Mesa software renderer was rewritten as a DRI interface module, called codice_1, improving the coupling of Mesa and the X server. Also in the year 2008 the new DRI2 was introduced to replace DRI, and with it a new model based in the Kernel mode-setting. In 2011, the Glamor project started, aiming to add a generic hardware-accelerated 2D X driver based in OpenGL. In 2013 Adam Jackson did a major rewrite of GLX code to consolidate the diverse paths from Glamor, indirect rendering, ... to one unique path to OpenGL&#x27;s library libGL. 

== Features ==

GLX consists of three parts:
# An API that provides OpenGL functions to an X Window System application.
# An extension of the X protocol, which allows the client (the OpenGL application) to send 3D rendering commands to the X server (the software responsible for the display). The client and server software may run on different computers.
# An extension of the X server that receives the rendering commands from the client and passes them on to the installed OpenGL library

If client and server are running on the same computer and an accelerated 3D graphics card using a suitable driver is available, the former two components can be bypassed by DRI. In this case, the client application is then allowed to directly access the video hardware through several API layers.

==Implementations==
* Mesa 3D – a free and open-source library which implements a couple of graphical APIs and also the available Free and open-source device drivers: graphics; for a last resort Mesa 3D also offers fallback software rendering.
* The proprietary device drivers for graphics chips also include an implementation of GLX.

==See also==
* WGL – the equivalent Microsoft Windows interface to OpenGL
* CGL – the equivalent macOS interface to OpenGL
* EGL – a similar cross-platform interface between OpenGL ES or VG and the underlying native platform window system
* GLUT – library of utilities for OpenGL programs

<text>Storm of the Century, alternatively known as Stephen King&#x27;s Storm of the Century, is a 1999 American horror television miniseries written by Stephen King and directed by Craig R. Baxley. Unlike many other television adaptations of King&#x27;s work, &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; was not based on a novel but was an original screenplay written by the author and directly produced for television. King described the screenplay as a &quot;novel for television&quot;. The screenplay was published as a mass-market book in February 1999 prior to the TV broadcast of the miniseries.

King has called &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; his personal favorite of all the TV productions related to his works.

==Plot==
As the people of Little Tall Island, Maine prepare for a powerful blizzard in 1989, elderly resident Martha Clarendon is brutally murdered by a menacing stranger. Town manager Robbie Beals investigates, and the stranger terrifies him by relating shameful secrets from his past. Mike Anderson, a supermarket manager and part-time constable, arrests the stranger, who identifies himself as André Linoge. Linoge seems to know the names and morbid secrets of all the island&#x27;s residents, and is particularly interested in Mike&#x27;s son Ralphie, who has a birthmark on his nose. Yet he gives no hint of his own background, saying only, &quot;Give me what I want, and I&#x27;ll go away.&quot; While sitting in a jail cell, Linoge possesses the minds of several townspeople, causing suicides and a murder. He then escapes the jail in the form of a wizened old man and repeats his demand before disappearing into the storm.

The residents take shelter from the storm in the town hall. As they sleep, Linoge appears on the televisions as a televangelist and lectures them on the consequences of refusing to accommodate a stranger. The residents have the same dream in which authorities find the island deserted after the storm and the word &quot;Croaton&quot; carved on a tree. A news reporter connects the disappearance to the lost Roanoke colony. Meanwhile Mike dreams that the townspeople walk into the ocean and drown. The next day, Linoge causes three residents to vanish while everyone is watching the lighthouse collapse. Two die and the third, Angie Carver, is discovered alive but visibly aged. Ralphie goes missing and, when found in a closet, says that he was with Linoge. With each death and abduction, Linoge sends his demand again.

The town&#x27;s children fall under a spell and go to sleep, dreaming that they are flying through the clouds with Linoge. That evening Mike finds Linoge inside the town hall holding a resident hostage. Amused by Mike&#x27;s sympathy for the townspeople, Linoge says that they are all sinners and criminals who merely pretend to be decent including Mike because of his dishonest past in college. He tells Mike to arrange a town meeting at 9:00 that night and escapes again. When the meeting gathers, Linoge tells the residents that he has lived thousands of years and, having grown old, and sick, he wants a child whom he can raise to be a sorcerer like him. He cannot take a child by force, but the dream that the residents had will come true if they refuse. He leaves them to debate for half an hour. Mike urges the people to stand up to Linoge and is horrified when all of them, even his wife Molly, decide to give in. Linoge returns and presides over a lottery in which Ralphie is chosen. Taking his warlock form once more, Linoge contemptuously thanks the residents and warns them never to speak about what has happened. He then walks out of the town hall with Ralphie in his arms and flies into the night sky. Mike rushes outside and falls to his knees in the snow, ignoring the people who sacrificed his child for their own sakes. 

In an epilogue, Mike divorces Molly, leaves Little Tall and severs ties with the people he once swore to protect and those he once called friends; he moves to California and enrolls to graduate school, completing his education honestly, and joins the United States Marshals Service in San Francisco after he earned his degree in Criminal Justice. Having lost her family, a thoroughly depressed Molly eventually gets remarried to Alton &quot;Hatch&quot; Hatcher, Mike&#x27;s deputy constable whose wife died over a year later after a heart failure from benzodiazepine overdose. Several other residents succumb to their guilt to Mike&#x27;s family and commit suicide (including Robbie Beals&#x27; wife Sandra and Angie&#x27;s husband Jack) over the course of nine years. Later, Linoge and Ralphie walk past Mike in Chinatown, Ralphie having become corrupted and demonic. Mike considers telling Molly what he saw but ultimately decides it&#x27;s better to stay quiet (knowing that it would only open old wounds) and move on.

==Production==
The screenplay for the miniseries was written by Stephen King expressly for television. The screenplay was published as a mass-market book by Pocket Books just prior to the initial airing of &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; on ABC. The book included photographs of the TV miniseries. The book contains an introduction in which King describes the genesis of the idea as it occurred to him in late 1996. Beginning to write it in December 1996, he initially debated if the story should be either a novel or a screenplay. He described the result as a &quot;novel for television&quot;. A hardcover edition, written as a screenplay rather than &quot;prose&quot;, was published concurrently by the Book of the Month Club.

&quot;Storm of the Century&quot; was filmed in Southwest Harbor, Maine and Toronto in 1998.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Storm of the Century&quot; aired on ABC on February 14–18, 1999. It was released on DVD on June 22 the same year.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 7.33/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Chilling performances and an even darker moral dilemma shelter &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;&#x27;s somewhat long-winded tale from ever being anything less than watchable.&quot;

Director Mike Flanagan has cited &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; as a major influence on his 2021 Netflix miniseries &quot;Midnight Mass&quot;.

<text>The Town Clock is a large clock that stands in downtown Dubuque, Iowa. The clock has stood over the city for over 140 years. The present clock is the second &quot;Town Clock&quot;; the first collapsed in the 1870s, killing three people. The building on which it originally stood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but the clock tower itself is not.

==History==

===The First Town Clock===
Dr. Asa Horr began the fundraising effort to build a town clock in Dubuque, Iowa in 1864. The clock was built by New York City&#x27;s Naylor &amp; Co. and its frame was designed by architect William Longhurst. George D. Wood gave a ten-year lease to the city for the clock to be placed on the John Bell and Company Store building which they owned. The building had originally housed a Congregational church and then &quot;The Odeon&quot;, a German theater. That was followed by the post office, and then a concert hall before it became the home of the John Bell Company. This first clock was placed on a tower of the building at a cost of $3,000. All men who had pledged at least $25 formed the Dubuque Town Clock Company to oversee its maintenance.

On May 25, 1872, several people noticed cracks forming in the walls of the store building. Workers attempted to clear the location where they expected the clock to fall. At 5:16 PM, both the clock and the John Bell store collapsed, killing a child and two women who were inside the store at the time. An investigation into the matter reported that the foundation of the Bell Store was not sufficient to handle the clock&#x27;s weight. It was also reported that construction next door was the primary cause of the accident. Losses from the disaster were estimated to be between $15,000 and $20,000.

===The Second Town Clock===

====Town Clock Building====
Dubuque residents soon decided to replace the collapsed Town Clock. George Wood, who had owned the collapsed building, wanted the new town clock on his property, but John Bell was not interested in being a part of the project. Wood decided to build the new building on his own, while the tower was paid for through subscriptions. He cleared the remainder of the collapsed building and the neighboring Dr. Lay residence. A partnership between architects Fridolin Heer, Sr. and Edward Naescher designed the new building, as well as plans for a new three-story tower. A three-story brick Italianate building was designed to support the tower, which rose above the building.

The city paid the $5,309.46 cost for the new clock, which began operating on April 17, 1873. The bell, which weighs over , was cast by Naylor &amp; Co. and the clock was built by Boston firm Howard &amp; Co. Time was recorded via a subterranean transit instrument which was used to observe the passage of stars. This provided accurate time readings to within half of a second and was always kept accurate within two seconds.

For a number of years, the clock had a mechanical movement. Two employees spent an hour and a half winding cranks that were attached to the weights, which would allow the clock to operate for one week. In 1923, the Town Clock was almost dismantled when the financial cost of repairs led the city council to decide to remove the clock. However, the council changed their minds when a poll found that a majority of citizens favored keeping and maintaining it. In 1927, the clock was electrified by Interstate Power Company when a new Seth Thomas movement was placed in the clock. Western Union then synchronized the clock.

====Urban Renewal====

With the urban renewal trend in the 1970s, the &quot;Your Town Clock Committee&quot; was organized. Their goal was to have the clock moved from its location at 825 Main Street to the new Town Clock Plaza, which the city council approved. The cost for the move was $70,000, which was raised through donations raised over a 14-month period.

The Durrant Architecture firm of Dubuque designed a pre-caast four-column pedestal that was then placed in the plaza. The actual tower was brought to the site on Feb 12, 1971, and bolted to the pedestal. The faces of the clock were placed at the new location on Feb 16, 1971. Afterwards the cupola was placed at the new site, which completed the move. After the reassembly was complete, the clock stood about 108 feet above the street, which was about two feet taller than at its previous location.

The move helped increase the visibility of the Town Clock, where it now served as the centerpiece at special events held at Town Clock Plaza. Otherwise, most of the traffic had moved out to the west end of the city. Main street had become an office park. In 1989, concerns were voiced about vibrations made by loud music and dancers possibly causing damage to the pedestal or the clock. The city studied the problem and stated its confidence that the Town Clock was structurally sound.

====Recent events====
In recent years, Main Street from Fifth street to Ninth street was reopened to automobile traffic after it was determined that the pedestrian plaza no longer was an effective option for the downtown area. This would have left the Town Clock standing in the middle of Main Street, but a small traffic circle was built around the clock. The clock continues to stand as a distinctive Dubuque landmark. Due to the cold it was frozen at 7:33, however it has been operational year round for several years.

<text>A tidal island is a raised area of land within a waterbody, which is connected to the larger mainland by a natural isthmus or man-made causeway that is exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide, causing the land to switch between being a promontory/peninsula and an island depending on tidal conditions.

Because of the mystique surrounding tidal islands, many of them have been sites of religious worship, such as Mont-Saint-Michel with its Benedictine abbey. Tidal islands are also commonly the sites of fortresses because of the natural barrier created by the tidal channel.

<text>Susan &quot;Suzy&quot; Elizabeth Rice is a screenwriter, author of fiction, painter and designer. Rice is noted as the designer of the logo for the series of &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, as well as many other film logo designs for print advertising and some filmed applications.

==Life==
Rice was educated at Western Illinois University, the University of Florida and the University of California, Irvine.

Whilst studying at Florida, Rice married the screenwriter and novelist Daniel H. Vining. She and Vining divorced, and she later married the designer and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; art director Anthony S. &quot;Tony&quot; Lane and worked under the name of Suzy Rice-Lane.

Rice lived and worked in Maui, Hawaii, for eight years where she worked as a painter before returning to California.

==Work==


Early in her career, Rice designed &quot;Dancing Madness&quot; (1976), a book written by Abe Peck, who was at the time an associate editor at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. This led Rice to work as assistant art director and designer for the magazine under her then-married name of Suzy Vining.

At the age of 22, she took up the position of art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising. In late 1976, the agency was approached by the film distributor Twentieth Century Fox which needed to promote a new epic space opera, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, in post-production at the time. Fox commissioned a brochure which they would send out to cinema theater owners, and Rice was given the job of designing it.

Rice liaised with Lucasfilm, Ltd. and on a visit to their visual effects production company, Industrial Light &amp; Magic in Van Nuys, she met with the director, George Lucas. Lucas instructed Rice to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear &quot;very fascist&quot; in style. Rice took a keen interest in typography and studied German font design for this task. Her response to her brief was to produce a bold logotype using an outlined, modified Helvetica Black. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; of &quot;STAR&quot; and the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; of &quot;WARS&quot;. In the version approved by Lucas, the letter &quot;W&quot; had sharp, pointed tips. Lucas signed off the brochure in between takes while involved in second unit filming.

The logo designed by Rice was not the original logo; Dan Perri, a seasoned Hollywood title sequence designer who developed the film&#x27;s now-famous opening crawl, had produced an earlier logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point. Perri&#x27;s logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the opening crawl, and while it did not appear on-screen, it was used widely on pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees. The producer of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Gary Kurtz, was impressed with Rice&#x27;s logo and selected it over Perri&#x27;s design for the film&#x27;s opening titles, after modifying the letter &quot;W&quot; to flatten the pointed tips originally designed by Rice. This finalised the design of one of the most recognisable logos in cinema design, although Rice&#x27;s contribution was not credited in the film.

Rice designed a poster in 1978 advertising a series of concerts of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; symphonic suite by John Williams. It features Rice&#x27;s logo and an illustration by John Alvin of C-3PO and R2-D2 carrying one-man band kits of musical instruments.

While employed at Seiniger Advertising, Rice was responsible for title design work and print advertising campaigns for a number of other films. She also designed a number of record album covers and various logos, posters and print advertising for the entertainment and healthcare industries. Years after her work for Seiniger Advertising and Lucasfilm, Rice returned to full-time education at the University of California, Irvine.

<doc id="641929" wikidata="Q1390927" url="?curid=641929" title="Lobengula">
<text>Lobengula Khumalo ( 1835 – 1894) was the second and last official king of the Northern Ndebele people (historically called Matabele in English). Both names in the Ndebele language mean &quot;the men of the long shields&quot;, a reference to the Ndebele warriors&#x27; use of the Nguni shield.

== Background ==
The Matabele were descendants of a faction of the Zulu people who fled north during the reign of Shaka following the &quot;mfecane&quot; (&quot;the crushing&quot;) or &quot;difaqane&quot; (&quot;the scattering&quot;). Shaka&#x27;s general, Mzilikazi led his followers away from Zulu territory after a falling-out. In the late 1830s, they settled in what is now called Matabeleland in western Zimbabwe, but they claimed sovereignty over a much wider area.

Members of the tribe had a privileged position against outsiders whose lives were subject to the will of the king. In return for their privileges, however, the Ndebele people both men and women had to submit to a strict discipline and status within the hierarchy. That set out their duties and responsibilities to the rest of society. Infringements of any social responsibility were punished with death, subject to the king&#x27;s seldom-awarded reprieve. This tight discipline and loyalty were the secret of the Ndebele&#x27;s success in dominating their neighbours.

== Birthright ==
After the death of Mzilikazi, the first king of the Ndebele nation, in 1868, the &quot;izinduna&quot;, or chiefs, offered the crown to Lobengula, one of Mzilikazi&#x27;s sons from an inferior wife. Several impis (regiments) led by Chief Mbiko Masuku disputed Lobengula&#x27;s ascent, and the question was ultimately decided by the arbitration of the assegai, with Lobengula and his impis crushing the rebels. Lobengula&#x27;s courage in the battle led to his unanimous selection as king.

== Coronation ==
The coronation of Lobengula took place at Mhlahlandlela, one of the principal military towns. The Ndebele nation assembled in the form of a large semicircle, performed a war dance, and declared their willingness to fight and die for Lobengula. A great number of cattle were slaughtered, and the choicest meats were offered to Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual leader, and to the dead Mzilikazi. Great quantities of millet beer were also consumed.

About 10,000 Matabele warriors in full war costume attended the crowning of Lobengula. Their costumes consisted of a headdress and short cape made of black ostrich feathers, a kilt made of leopard or other skins and ornamented with the tails of white cattle. Around their arms they wore similar tails and around their ankles they wore rings of brass and other metals. Their weapons consisted of one or more long spears for throwing and a short stabbing-spear or assegai (also the principal weapon of the Zulu people). For defence, they carried large oval shields of ox-hide, either black, white, red, or speckled according to the impi (regiment) they belonged to.

The Ndebele maintained their position due to the greater size and tight discipline in the army, to which every able-bodied man in the tribe owed service. &quot;The Ndebele army, consisting of 15,000 men in 40 regiments [was] based around Lobengula&#x27;s capital of Bulawayo.&quot;
== Rule ==
In 1870 King Lobengula granted Sir John Swinburne&#x27;s London and Limpopo Mining Company the right to search for gold and other minerals on a tract of land in the extreme southwest of Matabeleland along the Tati River between the Shashe and Ramaquabane rivers, in what became known as the Tati Concession. However, it was not until about 1890 that any significant mining in the area commenced.

Lobengula had been tolerant of the white hunters who came to Matabeleland; he would even go so far as to punish those of his tribe who threatened the whites. However, when a British team (Francis Thompson, Charles Rudd and Rochfort Maguire) came in 1888 to try to persuade him to grant them the right to dig for minerals in additional parts of his territory, he was wary about entering into negotiations. Lobengula gave his agreement only when his friend, Leander Starr Jameson, a qualified medical doctor who had once treated Lobengula for gout, proposed to secure money and weaponry for the Matabele in addition to a pledge that any people who came to dig would be considered as living in his kingdom. As part of this agreement, and at the insistence of the British, neither the Boers nor the Portuguese would be permitted to settle or gain concessions in Matabeleland. Although, Lobengula was illiterate and was not aware of how damaging this contract was to his country, only found out the real terms of the contract he signed as his subjects found out. After going to friendly English missionaries to confirm this rumor, Lobengula sent two emissaries to the British queen,Victoria, but this proved futile. They were delayed by Alfred Beit&#x27;s associates at the port. As a last resort, Lobengula formally protested the contract to the queen on 23 April 1889. As a response from the queen&#x27;s advisor, Lobengula was told it was &quot;impossible for them to exclude white men&quot;. Lobengula informed Queen Victoria he and his Indunas would recognize the contract as they believe he was tricked. The 25-year Rudd Concession was signed by Lobengula on 30 October 1888.


== Matabele War ==
The First Matabele War began in October 1893, and the British South Africa Company&#x27;s overwhelming military force led to devastating losses for the Ndebele warriors, notably at the Battle of the Shangani. As early as December 1893, it was reported that Lobengula had been very sick, but his death sometime in early 1894 was kept a secret for many months, and the cause of his death remains uncertain. 

By October 1897, the white colonists had successfully settled in much of the territory known later as Rhodesia.
== Personal life ==
He had well over 20 wives, possibly many more; among them were Xwalile, daughter of king Mzila of the Gaza Empire, and Lozikeyi.

<doc id="641931" wikidata="Q17198551" url="?curid=641931" title="Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem">
<text>The Kingdom of Jerusalem, one of the Crusader states that was created in 1099, was divided into a number of smaller seigneuries. According to the 13th-century jurist John of Ibelin, the four highest crown vassals (referred to as barons) in the kingdom proper were the count of Jaffa and Ascalon, the prince of Galilee, the lord of Sidon, and the lord of Oultrejordain.

There were also a number of independent seigneuries, and some land held under direct royal control, such as Jerusalem itself, Acre and Tyre.

== Northern states ==
Aside from the Kingdom of Jerusalem, there were also three other major Crusader states in the Near East:
*County of Edessa
*County of Tripoli
*Principality of Antioch

These states nominally bore some dependency on the kingdom of Jerusalem. The king of Jerusalem was bound to reconcile them in case of disputes, or between a vassal prince and the Latin patriarch of Antioch, and could claim the regency in case of a vacancy or minority in their successions.

Edessa was perhaps the most closely tied to the kingdom, despite its distance. Its first two counts became kings of Jerusalem, and the county was bestowed as a royal gift on Joscelin I of Edessa.

The County of Tripoli, the nearest of them, is sometimes considered to have been a vassal lordship under the king&#x27;s suzerainty, although it preserved an extraordinary degree of sovereignty.

Antioch was almost independent, for it was founded already before the kingship and its first holder was a rival of kings, the original leader of the crusade. Later in its history, it would at times recognize Byzantine or Armenian suzerainty, or none at all.

These states dated their documents by the reigns of their own rulers, carried out their own foreign policy, and sent military aid to the kingdom of their own will, rather than through feudal obligation; therefore, they are generally recognized as sovereign and are treated more fully under their own articles.

The Principality of Antioch, County of Tripoli and the Kingdom of Jerusalem were autonomous states.

== County of Jaffa and Ascalon ==
Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast, was fortified after the First Crusade, and was a separate county until the revolt of Hugh II of Le Puiset in 1134. Afterwards, it was usually held directly by the royal family or one of their relatives. After 1153, it became the double County of Jaffa and Ascalon, when the Fatimid fortress of Ascalon was conquered. It passed in and out of direct royal control, and became titular after the loss of the counties to the Muslims in the 13th-century . A number of seigneuries were vassals to the count of Jaffa, including the Lordship of Ramla, Lordship of Ibelin and Lordship of Mirabel.

=== Counts of Jaffa ===

Jaffa was taken by the Crusaders in June 1099 during the siege of Jerusalem and became part of the kingdom shortly thereafter. The counts of Jaffa were:

*Hugh I of Jaffa, first cousin of King Baldwin II, 1110–1118
::Albert of Namur ruled on behalf of his stepson Hugh II from 1118 to 1122.
*Hugh II of Jaffa, son of Hugh I, 1122–1134
::Jaffa was confiscated into the royal domain in 1134.
*Amalric of Jerusalem, son of Queen Melisende, 1151–1153 (when he reached the age of maturity)

Jaffa merged with newly-conquered Ascalon in 1153, becoming the County of Jaffa and Ascalon.

=== Counts of Jaffa and Ascalon ===

After the siege of Ascalon in 1153, the frontier fortress of Ascalon joined Jaffa in a combined county. The counts of Jaffa and Ascalon were:

*Amalric of Jerusalem, 1153–1163
::Amalric became king in 1163. The county was next granted to his daughter on her first marriage.
*Sibylla of Jerusalem, 1176–1186, with her husbands William of Montferrat (1176–1177) and Guy of Lusignan (1180–1186)
::Jaffa and Ascalon were occupied by the Ayyubids from 1187 to 1191.
* Geoffrey of Lusignan (1191–1193), brother of Guy of Lusignan
*Aimery of Lusignan, brother of Guy of Lusignan, 1193–1198
::Aimery married Queen Isabella I in 1198, and so from 1198 to 1221 the county was part of the royal domain.
*Walter IV of Brienne (1221–1244), nephew of John of Brienne and grandson-in-law of King Aimery and Queen Isabella I, 1221–1244
*John of Ibelin, son of Philip of Ibelin, Queen Isabella I&#x27;s half-brother, 1244–1266
::Ascalon was again occupied by the Ayyubids in 1247.
* James of Ibelin, son of John, 1266–1268
Jaffa was occupied by the Mamluks in 1268.

=== Lordship of Ramla ===
Originally held by the bishop of Ramla-Lydda, in 1126 Ramla became part of Jaffa, and a separate lordship was created after Hugh II&#x27;s revolt in 1134. The castle of Ibelin happened to be located quite near Ramla. It was later a part of the Lordship of Ibelin, inherited from Helvis of Ramla, daughter of Baldwin I of Ramla and wife of Barisan of Ibelin. The Lords of Ramla were:

*Baldwin I of Ramla, 1134–1138
*Barisan of Ibelin, 1138–1150
*Manasses of Hierges, 1150–1152
*Hugh of Ibelin, son of Barisan of Ibelin, 1152–1169
*Baldwin of Ibelin, brother of Hugh of Ibelin, 1169–1186
* Thomas of Ibelin, son of Baldwin of Ibelin, 1186–1187
*&quot;Ramla occupied by Ayyubids, 1187–1191&quot;
*Balian of Ibelin, brother of Baldwin of Ibelin, 1191–1193
*John of Ibelin, son of Balian, 1193–1247
*&quot;Lordship held by Counts of Jaffa and Ascalon after 1247&quot;.

=== Lordship of Ibelin ===
The Lordship of Ibelin was also created out of Jaffa (in the 1140s, or perhaps as early as 1134 after Hugh II&#x27;s revolt). The lordship was given as a reward to Barisan of Ibelin, whose wife Helvis of Ramla already owned lands in the vicinity. The castle of Ramla, the family&#x27;s other inheritance, was nearby, and together these territories formed a wealthy entity. Balian of Ibelin married Maria Comnena, widow of Amalric I of Jerusalem, and the Ibelins became the most powerful noble family of the kingdom, later ruling also over Beirut (see Lordship of Beirut, below). The lords of Ibelin were:

*Barisan of Ibelin, c. 1134–1150
*Hugh of Ibelin, son of Barisan of Ibelin, 1150–1170
*Balian of Ibelin, son of Barisan of Ibelin, 1170–1193
*John of Ibelin, son of Balian, 1193–1236
*&quot;Lordship held by Counts of Jaffa and Ascalon after 1236.&quot;

=== Lordship of Mirabel ===
Mirabel was separated from Jaffa after the revolt in 1134, and given to Baldwin of Ibelin in 1166, although it was separate from Ibelin. He was succeeded by his son Thomas of Ibelin, ruling from 1186–1188.

== Principality of Galilee ==
The Principality of Galilee was established by Tancred in 1099 and was centered around Tiberias in Galilee proper, and was sometimes called the Principality of Tiberias or the Tiberiad. The principality became the fief of the families of Saint Omer, Montfaucon (Falcomberques), and then Bures. The principality was destroyed by Saladin in 1187, although the title was used by relatives and younger sons of the kings of Cyprus (the titular kings of Jerusalem) afterwards. The principality had its own vassals, the Lordships of Beirut, Nazareth and Haifa, which often had their own sub-vassals.

=== Princes of Galilee ===
The princes of Galilee were:

* Tancred, 1099–1101
* Hugh of Fauquembergues, 1101–1106
* Gervaise de Bazoches, 1106–1108
* Tancred, second reign, 1109–1112
* Joscelin I of Edessa (as Lord of Courtenay), 1112–1119
* William I of Bures, 1120–1141
* Elinand, 1142–1148
* William II of Bures, brother of Elinand, 1148–1158
* Eschiva of Bures, 1159–1187, with Gautier of Saint Omer (1159–1171) and Raymond III of Tripoli (1174–1187)
* &quot;Galilee occupied by Ayyubids,&quot; 1187–1240
* Eschiva of Saint Omer, granddaughter of William II, 1240–1247, with Odo of Montbéliard (1240–1247)
* &quot;Galilee taken by Ayyubids,&quot; 1247.

The sons of William I I of Bures were titular princes of Galilee after the death of Eschiva of Bures in 1187: Hugh II of Saint Omer from 1187–1204 and Raoul of Saint Omer from 1204–1219. Eschiva of Saint Omer was daughter of Raoul of Saint Omer, and she was titular princess of Galilee from 1219–1240 and 1247 until after 1265. He husband was titular prince of Galilee from 1219–1240.

=== Lordship of Nazareth ===
Nazareth was the original site of the Latin patriarch, established by Tancred. It was created as a seigneury in Galilee in 1115. The archbishop of Nazareth also ruled over Haifa.

=== Lordship of Haifa ===
Haifa was partly an ecclesiastical domain ruled by the archbishop of Nazareth, and partly created from other lands in the Principality of Galilee. The lords of Haifa were:

*Geldemar Carpenel, 1100–1101
*Tancred, 1101–1103
* Rorgius, 1103–1107
* Pagan, 1107–1112
*&quot;Royal domain,&quot; 1112–1187
*&quot;Haifa occupied by Ayyubids,&quot; 1187–1191
* Vivian, c. 1140s
* Pagan, 1190–?
* Rorgius II, ?–1244?
* Garsias Alvarez, c. 1250
* Gilles d&#x27;Estrain, c. 1260
*&quot;Haifa taken by Mamluks,&quot; 1265.

== Lordship of Beirut ==

Beirut was captured in 1110 and given to Fulk of Guînes. It was one of the longest-lived seigneuries, surviving until the final collapse of the kingdom in 1291, although only as a tiny strip on the Mediterranean coast surrounding Beirut. It was important for trade with Europe, and had its own vassals. The lords of Beirut were :

Beirut taken by Mamluks in 1291.

The vassals of the lord Beirut were the lords of Banias and the lords of Toron.

=== Lordship of Banias ===
Banias (Caesarea Philippi) was under the control of the Assassins from 1126–1129, when it was given to the Franks following the purge of the sect in Damascus by Taj al-Muluk Buri. The area was in dispute from 1132–1140 when Banias was merged with Toron under Humphrey II of Toron. It fell to Nur ad-Din in 1164, and when recovered it became part of the Lordship of Joscelin III of Edessa (see below).

=== Lordship of Chastel Neuf ===
Chastel Neuf was built by Hugh of Falkenberg around 1105 but was later given to the Hospitallers, until it fell to Nur ad-Din in 1167.
== Lordship of Toron ==
The castle of Toron was built by Hugh of Fauquembergues to help capture Tyre, and was given to Humphrey I of Toron in 1107. The lords of Toron tended to be very influential in the kingdom. Humphrey II was constable of Jerusalem. This grandson Humphrey IV was married to Isabella, Amalric I&#x27;s daughter. Toron was later merged with the royal domain of Tyre. Toron had two vassals of its own, the Lordship of Castel Neuf, which fell to Nur ad-Din in 1167, and the Lordship of Toron-Ahmud, which was sold to the Teutonic Knights in 1261. The lords of Toron were:

== Lordship of Oultrejordain==
The Lordship of Oultrejordain, consisting of land with an undefined boundary to the east of the Jordan River, was one of the largest and most important seigneuries. It was an important source of revenue, from the Muslim caravan routes that existed there. The last lord, Raynald of Châtillon, received Oultrejordain by marrying its heiress, Stephanie of Milly. Raynald considered himself prince of Oultrejordain, not subject to the king, and was especially hostile to the Muslims. He was largely responsible for Saladin&#x27;s invasion of the kingdom in 1187. Saladin conquered much of the area in 1187 and personally executed Raynald at the Battle of Hattin. The lords of Oultrejordain were:

* Roman of Le Puy, possibly 1118–1126
* Pagan the Butler, 1126–1147
* Maurice of Montreal, nephew of Pagan, 1147–1161
* Philip of Milly, with his wife Isabella, daughter of Maurice, 1161–1168

=== Lordship of Tyre ===
Conrad of Montferrat practically created this lordship during the Third Crusade by defending it, as it was the only remaining town of the kingdom. Tyre, always an important town, had been part of the royal domain, and after Conrad, it also belonged to the kings personally. After the kingdom moved to Acre, coronations took place in Tyre. Sometime after 1246, Tyre was conferred upon Philip of Montfort by Henry I of Cyprus (then regent of Jerusalem) for his support of the Ibelin (baronial) party against the Imperialists. The grant was confirmed c. 1269 by Hugh III of Cyprus, with a clause allowing Hugh to buy back the lordship. This was exercised in 1284, when the city was given to his sister Margaret, already the dowager lady of Tyre. The lords of Tyre were:

* &quot;Royal domain,&quot; 1124–1129
* Fulk of Anjou, 1129–1131
* &quot;Royal domain,&quot; 1131–1187
* Conrad of Montferrat, 1190–1192
* &quot;Royal domain.&quot; 1192–1246
* Philip of Montfort, 1246–1269
* John of Montfort, son of Philip, 1269–1283
* Humphrey of Montfort, brother of John, 1283–1284
* &quot;Royal domain,&quot; 1284–1289
* Amalric of Lusignan, 1289–1291
* &quot;Tyre taken by Mamluks,&quot; 1291.

===Lordship of Joscelin III of Edessa ===
This lordship, often called the &quot;seigneurie de Joscelin&quot;, was an unusual creation given to Joscelin III, the nominal count of Edessa, which had been lost long before. It was created around 1176 when Joscelin married Agnes of Milly, and was formed from royal land around Acre. Joscelin had only daughters, who married into the families of von Henneberg and Mandelee. The heirs sold in 1220 the seigneury to the Teutonic Knights, who used the place near Acre as their fortress in Outremer. The archives of the lordship are the only baronial archives of Outremer to survive.

== Inheritance in the Kingdom of Jerusalem ==
Lordships in the Kingdom of Jerusalem were usually hereditary, in principle, but in practice the circumstances were such that their holders did not form long uninterrupted lines of inheritance, which was contrary to the usual patterns of succession in Europe.

Firstly, in the early years of the kingdom, lords sought out their own territories, and lordships changed hands often. Secondly, the average lifespan of male lords in Palestine was rather low, due to the constant state of warfare and violence, which led to inheritances by females and/or extinction of whole families.

Succession from father to son happened more rarely than in more peaceful countries in Europe. Female succession opened up the option for the liege or the monarch to reward services, loyalty and capability, as well as achievements, by giving an heiress&#x27; hand in marriage and her inherited lordship to a &quot;new man&quot;.

A typical succession pattern was a father followed by a daughter, sister, or niece, who was then married to a man worthy of some reward, who then himself succeeded to the territory. This made the succession unpredictable and caused the family holding a particular territory to change once or perhaps even more often in a generation.

Sometimes families became extinct, or escaped from Syria, and either a distant relative came to claim their land, or more usually, their liege gave the lordship to another family. Sometimes a lord was condemned for treason, rebellion or some other reason, and he and possibly his descendants were disinherited from the lordship.

Occasionally, vacant lordships were put into the &quot;royal domain&quot;, but more often, another person received the lordship. A less careful observer may think that they were not hereditary, but almost always their succession took place according to feudal rights of inheritance, utilizing the relatively high number of heiresses.

Many of these seigneuries ceased to exist after the loss of Jerusalem in 1187, and the rest of them after the fall of Acre in 1291, yet they often had Cypriot or European claimants for decades or centuries afterwards; these claimants, of course, held no actual territory in Syria after the mainland kingdom was lost.

<doc id="641938" wikidata="Q1932124" url="?curid=641938" title="Xu Bing">
<text>Xu Bing (; born 1955) is a Chinese artist who served as vice-president of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. He is known for his printmaking skills and installation art, as well as his creative artistic use of language, words, and text and how they have affected our understanding of the world. He is an A.D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. He was awarded the MacArthur Fellows Program in 1999 and the Fukuoka Prize in 2003.

==Biography==
Born in Chongqing in 1955, Xu grew up in Beijing. His father was the head of the history department at Peking University. In 1975, near the end of the Cultural Revolution, he was relocated to the countryside for two years as part of Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;re-education&quot; policy. Returning to Beijing in 1977, he enrolled at the Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA) in Beijing, where he joined the printmaking department and also worked during a short period of time as a teacher, receiving his master&#x27;s degree in Fine Art in 1987. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, his recent work came under scrutiny from the government and received harsh criticism for what was perceived as a critique of the Chinese government. Due to the political pressure and artistic restrictions of the post-Tiananmen period in China, Xu Bing, like many of his contemporaries, moved to the United States in 1990 where he was invited by the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He then resided to the United States until his appointment as vice-president of the Beijing CAFA in 2008.

In 1990–91, Xu had his first exhibition in the United States at the University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s Elvehjem Museum of Art (now Chazen Museum of Art) including his installations &quot;A Book from the Sky&quot; and &quot;Ghosts Pounding the Wall&quot;. In &quot;Book from the Sky&quot;, the artist invented 4,000 characters and hand-carved them into wood blocks, then used them as movable type to print volumes and scrolls, which are displayed laid out on the floor and hung from the ceiling. The vast planes of text seem to convey ancient wisdom, but are in fact unintelligible. &quot;The Glassy Surface of a Lake&quot;, a site-specific installation for the Elvehjem, was on view in 2004–05. In this work, a net of cast aluminum letters forming a passage from Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot; stretches across the museum&#x27;s atrium and pours down into an illegible pile of letters on the floor below.

Working in a wide range of media, Xu creates installations that question the idea of communicating meaning through language, demonstrating how both meanings and written words can be easily manipulated. He received a MacArthur Foundation grant in July 1999, presented to him for &quot;originality, creativity, self-direction, and capacity to contribute importantly to society, particularly in printmaking and calligraphy.&quot;

In 2003 he exhibited at the then new Chinese Arts centre in Manchester, and in 2004 he won the inaugural &quot;Artes Mundi&quot; prize in Wales for &quot;Where does the dust collect itself?&quot;, an installation using dust he collected in New York City on the day after the destruction of the World Trade Center. He won also a half year of free work and study at the American Academy in Berlin 2004.

Xu Bing was appointed the new vice president of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, March 2008.

==Art==

===Early works===
While at the Central Academy of Fine Arts Xu Bing mastered the Socialist Realism style of art so predominant during the Maoist era. After graduating with his degree in printmaking, the artist veered away and created simple but dramatic woodcuts, such as &quot;Shattered Jade&quot; (1977) and &quot;Bustling Village on the Water&quot; (1980–81, 繁忙的水乡). In 1987, Xu Bing returned to his training in printmaking to create large and elaborate installation pieces like &quot;Book from the Sky&quot; (1987) and &quot;Ghosts Pounding the Wall&quot; (1990).

===Installation pieces===

====&quot;A Book from the Sky&quot;====
Xu Bing&#x27;s &quot;Tianshu&quot; (&quot;Book from the Sky&quot;) is a large installation featuring precisely laid out rows of books and hanging scrolls with written &quot;Chinese&quot; texts. Even so, this work challenges our very approach to language because of the unique nature of the text written on the paper. First presented in Beijing in 1988, the learned élite felt slighted by the artists&#x27; bold move to design and print over 4,000 characters that looked Chinese but were completely meaningless according to standard Mandarin. Xu Bing infuses his work with meaning by stirring confusion and discomfort in his audience, mostly due to the fact that the Chinese characters used in these texts are not &quot;real&quot; characters.

This piece was well received in China until 1989, whereupon the social and political drama of the Tiananmen Square protests led the government to look askance at Xu Bing&#x27;s &quot;Tianshu&quot;. Leaving China in 1991 for the political and artistic freedom of the United States, Xu Bing continued to explore and express his thoughts on deconstructing language to challenge our most &quot;natural&quot; cultural assumptions. His thought-provoking work enticed Western audiences, and he soon became one of the leading artists in the modern Chinese art scene.

====&quot;Ghosts Pounding the Wall&quot;====
Using his background in print-making, in May and June 1990 Xu Bing and a team of art students and help from local residents began a monumental project: creating a rubbing from a section of the Great Wall at Jinshanling. In order to create the rubbings, Xu Bing used entirely traditional Chinese methods and materials for stone rubbing, including rice paper and ink. Measuring 32m x 15m, the resulting installation piece consists of 29 rubbings of different sections of the Great Wall.

As in the case of many of his works, Xu Bing directly related his colossal piece, &quot;Ghosts Pounding the Wall&quot;, to the political situation in China. While surveying his work while installed at Elvehjem Museum of Art, Xu Bing said that his Great Wall represents &quot;a kind of thinking that makes no sense and is very conservative, a really closed-in thinking that symbolizes the isolationism of Chinese politics.&quot; The prints of the Great Wall rise up on either side of the exhibit, making the viewer seem small and insignificant in comparison to the massive, looming representations of solid stone walls.

====&quot;Square Word Calligraphy&quot;====

From 1994 he started a new project, in which he adapted Latin alphabets into the shape of &quot;hanzi&quot;. He called this &quot;New English Calligraphy&quot;, and gave lessons in how to write the characters. 

====&quot;Background Story&quot;====
In his series &quot;Background Story&quot;, Xu Bing uses unusual materials in order to create a deceptively typical Chinese Scroll Painting. From the front, the piece very much resembles a traditional Shan Shui (Landscape) scroll painting, with images of mountains, trees, and rivers. However, when seen from behind, the viewer is surprised to find that the beautiful &quot;painting&quot; is in fact created by using the shapes and shadows of random natural plant debris. Once again, Xu Bing challenges his audience&#x27;s basic assumptions and shows them that everything is not always as it first seems. In 2022, Xu Bing created a version of &quot;Background Story&quot; for Cornell University&#x27;s Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art based on a Ming Dynasty work in its collection, &quot;Woodcutter in Winter Mountains&quot;, by Yang Xun. Through his reconsideration of the earlier landscape painting, the artist practices &quot;fang,&quot; a traditional form of artistic imitation.

====Phoenix project====
In 2008, after returning to China to take the position at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Xu Bing was asked to create a sculpture for the atrium of the World Financial Center, which was then being developed in Beijing. He was shocked by primitive working conditions he saw at the construction site, later saying that they &quot;made my skin quiver.&quot; He was inspired to construct two large sculptures in the form of birds that are made largely out of construction debris and tools that he salvaged from the site. The larger sculpture, long, is identified as a male and named Feng in accordance with the Chinese phoenix tradition. The smaller one is long and is a female named Huang. Originally planned to take four months, the sculptures ultimately took two years to build; by that time the developers of the complex had decided the sculptures did not meet their needs. They were displayed at the Today Art Museum in Beijing and at the Shanghai World Expo before coming to the United States in 2012. After a year at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, they were then moved to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, where they were unveiled to the public on 1 March 2014. They were suspended from the ceiling of the nave, where they are now expected to spend about a year. The Phoenix sculpture is the subject of the documentary &quot;Xu Bing: Phoenix&quot; by Daniel Traub.

===Later mediums===
Xu Bing&#x27;s art medium has evolved over the years, morphing from one style to the next: print-making and wood-block carving, installation art, live installation art, metalwork and sculpture, landscaping, and even virtual and digital mediums.

Taking installation art a step further, Xu Bing focused on live installation art by using animals in his exhibits, such as in the case of the &quot;Silkworm Series&quot; and a &quot;Case Study of Transference&quot; (using silkworms and pigs, respectively) in 1994, or by showcasing sheep in &quot;The Net&quot; (1997). Later he explored the combination of modern and traditional mediums, as in the case of &quot;Background Story&quot; (2004–present) where his work imitates a traditional Chinese brush and ink scroll from the front, but is in fact designed by means of the projected shadows of plants and sticks. Even more recently, Xu Bing has delved into sculpture and metalworking, as seen in &quot;Monkeys Grasping the Moon&quot; (2001) and the &quot;Phoenix Project&quot; (2010).

==Influences and themes==
Xu Bing&#x27;s art mostly reflects cultural issues which raged during his early life in China. Most notably, the cultural and linguistic reforms enacted by the Communist Party in China under Mao Zedong&#x27;s leadership weigh heavily on modern Chinese artists who lived through this period. Similarly, the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) also rankles the modern Chinese artistic consciousness even though different artists have focused on different angles. Xu Bing in particular plays with the notion of the paradox between the power and fickleness of language, of what it means to be human, and of how our perceptions color our worldview.

Xu Bing plays incessantly with the role, purpose, and reality of language. Early in his life his father would make him write a page of characters a day, encouraging him to not only copy their form to perfection, but also to capture their spirit, their essence. During Mao&#x27;s cultural reformations and the reorganization of the standard Chinese language, Xu Bing experienced the constant reformation of words. This constant linguistic change influenced his art: Xu Bing emphasizes the immortality of the essence of language while vividly illustrating the impermanence and capriciousness of words themselves. In this way language becomes malleable and it can be fashioned to either liberate or control. Just as it is nigh impossible to detangle life from politics during the Cultural Revolution era (and its ramifications in decades to follow), Xu Bing also intertwines political messages into his art.

It was not until 2008 that Xu Bing set aside his post-Maoist reactionary art and invested in other topics. For example, he took on environmental projects such as &quot;Forest Project&quot;, which encouraged the &quot;uninterrupted flow of funds from developed countries to Kenya, earmarked for the planting of new trees.&quot; Even so, his focus is always on the effect that environmental issues have on people, such as the villages in Kenya, not necessarily the effects on the landscape or on the political situation.

At the turn of the millennium, a new defining social pattern emerged after the terrorist attacks in the United States on 9/11, 2001. Tension grew between the West and the Middle East, finally exploding into what was labeled as &quot;the War on Terror.&quot; This situation gave rise to social themes of anxiety and hopelessness, which eventually have seeped into the realm of the arts. Even so, some artists like Xu Bing chose to explore the serenity found in the midst of chaos, as illustrated in his work &quot;Where does the Dust Itself Collect?&quot; (2004, 2011). For this piece, the artist gathered dust from the aftermath of the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York after September 11, 2001, and uses it to recreate the gray film that covered Manhattan in the weeks following the attacks. Stenciled in the dust, a Buddhist poem reads, &quot;As there is nothing from the first, where does the dust itself collect?&quot; Using this tragedy as an expression of the human narrative, Xu Bing contemplates the relationship between the material and the spiritual, and he explores &quot;the complicated circumstances created by different world perspectives.&quot;

<doc id="641942" wikidata="Q5311172" url="?curid=641942" title="Dubuque County Courthouse">
<text>The Dubuque County Courthouse is located on Central Avenue, between 7th and 8th Streets, in Dubuque, Iowa, United States. The current structure was built from 1891 to 1893 to replace an earlier building. These are believed to be the only two structures to house the county courts and administrative offices.

The courthouse houses several county government offices including the county auditor, treasurer, attorney, and facilities for the Iowa District Court for Dubuque County.

==History==
Information about the first courthouse in Dubuque is sparse. The first known attempt at a courthouse were the plans for a two-story log structure in 1836, but it was never built. By 1843 it was decided that the increased private business in Dubuque necessitated an increase in public business. Therefore, the county built a red brick building to house its records and offices. It is possible that this building was already under construction as there are records of expenditures for brick, lumber, lime, ironwork, and architectural fees dating back to 1839. An addition was built onto the front of this building in 1856. By 1869 there was talk of building a new courthouse as the county had outgrown this building and it was considered outdated and ill-shaped. Even after a petition for a new courthouse was presented in 1878, there was no serious movement toward construction until 1890.

The United States Congress had authorized the use of Washington Square for the new courthouse, but the choice was made to locate it on the site of the old one. County officials chose local architect Fridolin Heer, designer of Sacred Heart Church and several other notable buildings in the city. Twenty-five year bonds totaling $125,000 were sold in April 1891, and the cornerstone was laid on July 11 of the same year. The building was completed two years later.

The Dubuque County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Its significance is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of Dubuque as the county seat. The adjacent Dubuque County Jail is a National Historic Landmark.

==Architecture==

Heer designed the structure in the Beaux-Arts style with elements of the Renaissance and the Romanesque styles. It is constructed of Bedford limestone on the first floor and red brick and molded terra cotta on the floors above. The frieze is composed of galvanized iron or zinc. The building has a footprint of . It is five-stories topped by a central tower surmounted by a statue of Justice. All total, the building rises to a height of . Upon completion, 12 classic statues of laminated pewter adorned the roof, however only six remain. Some reports say the others were removed during World War I to provide materiel for the war effort. The interior features the shaft of the tower that terminates on the fourth floor with a dome of stained glass. Woodwork and fittings are of oak with carvings that are done in a Richardsonian character.

===Renovations===
Renovations were done to the building over the years, especially in the 1980s. Changes include the installation of a glass elevator, a granite fountain was placed on the ground floor, and the entrances into the building were moved to the ground level from the second floor. Gold leaf was applied to the tower dome. Given the various weather conditions, it did not hold and it had to be repaired. The county reevaluated security at the courthouse following the murders of a judge in Georgia and a judge&#x27;s family in Illinois. All entrances, but one, were closed and visitors and their possessions were screened.

<text>In psychology, the Asch conformity experiments or the Asch paradigm were a series of studies directed by Solomon Asch studying if and how individuals yielded to or defied a majority group and the effect of such influences on beliefs and opinions.

Developed in the 1950s, the methodology remains in use by many researchers. Uses include the study of conformity effects of task importance, age, sex, and culture.

== Initial conformity experiment ==

=== Rationale ===
Many early studies in social psychology were adaptations of earlier work on &quot;suggestibility&quot; whereby researchers such as Edward L. Thorndyke were able to shift the preferences of adult subjects towards majority or expert opinion. Still the question remained as to whether subject opinions were actually able to be changed, or if such experiments were simply documenting a Hawthorne effect in which participants simply gave researchers the answers they wanted to hear. Solomon Asch&#x27;s experiments on group conformity mark a departure from these earlier studies by removing investigator influence from experimental conditions.

In 1951, Asch conducted his first conformity laboratory experiments at Swarthmore College, laying the foundation for his remaining conformity studies. The experiment was published on two occasions.

=== Method ===
Groups of eight male college students participated in a simple &quot;perceptual&quot; task. In reality, all but one of the participants were actors, and the true focus of the study was about how the remaining participant would react to the actors&#x27; behavior.

The actors knew the true aim of the experiment, but were introduced to the subject as other participants. Each student viewed a card with a line on it, followed by another with three lines labeled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; (see accompanying figure). One of these lines was identical in length to that on the first card, and the other two lines were clearly longer or shorter (i.e., a near-100% rate of correct responding was expected). Each participant was then asked to say aloud which line matched the length of that on the first card. Before the experiment, all actors were given detailed instructions on how they should respond to each trial (card presentation). They would always unanimously nominate one comparator, but on certain trials they would give the correct response and on others, an incorrect response. The group was seated such that the real participant always responded last.

Subjects completed 18 trials. On the first two trials, both the subject and the actors gave the obvious, correct answer. On the third trial, the actors would all give the same wrong answer. This wrong-responding recurred on 11 of the remaining 15 trials. It was subjects&#x27; behavior on these 12 &quot;critical trials&quot; (the 3rd trial + the 11 trials where the actors gave the same wrong answer) that formed the aim of the study: to test how many subjects would change their answer to conform to those of the 7 actors, despite it being wrong. Subjects were interviewed after the study including being debriefed about the true purpose of the study. These post-test interviews shed valuable light on the both because they revealed subjects often were &quot;just going along&quot;, and because they revealed considerable individual differences to Asch. Additional trials with slightly altered conditions were also run, including having a single actor also give the correct answer.

Asch&#x27;s experiment also had a condition in which participants were tested alone with only the experimenter in the room. In total, there were 50 subjects in the experimental condition and 37 in the control condition.

=== Results ===

In the control group, with no pressure to conform to actors, the error rate on the critical stimuli was less than 0.7%.

In the actor condition also, the majority of participants&#x27; responses remained correct (64.3%), but a sizable minority of responses conformed to the actors&#x27; (incorrect) answer (35.7%). The responses revealed strong individual differences: 12% of participants followed the group in nearly all of the tests. 26% of the sample consistently defied majority opinion, with the rest conforming on some trials. An examination of all critical trials in the experimental group revealed that one-third of all responses were incorrect. These incorrect responses often matched the incorrect response of the majority group (i.e., actors). Overall, 74% of participants gave at least one incorrect answer out of the 12 critical trials. Regarding the study results, Asch stated: &quot;That intelligent, well-meaning young people are willing to call white black is a matter of concern.&quot;

==== Interview responses ====
Participants&#x27; interview responses revealed a complex mixture of individual differences in subjects&#x27; reaction to the experimental situation, with distinct reactions linked to factors such as confidence, self-doubt, the desire to be normative, and resolving perceived confusion over the nature of the task.

Asch&#x27;s report included interviews of a subject that remained &quot;independent&quot; and another that &quot;yielded&quot;. Each provided a descriptive account following disclosure of the true nature of the experiment. The &quot;independent&quot; subject said that he felt happy and relieved and added, &quot;I do not deny that at times I had the feeling: &#x27;to go with it[...] I&#x27;ll go along with the rest. At the other end of the spectrum, one &quot;yielding&quot; subject (who conformed in 11 of 12 critical trials) said, &quot;I suspected about the but tried to push it out of my mind.&quot; Asch points out that although the &quot;yielding&quot; subject was suspicious, he was not sufficiently confident to go against the majority.

==== Attitudes of independent responders ====
Subjects who did not conform to the majority reacted either with &quot;confidence&quot;: they experienced conflict between their idea of the obvious answer and the group&#x27;s incorrect answer, but stuck with their own answer, or were &quot;withdrawn&quot;. These latter subjects stuck with their perception but did not experience conflict in doing so. Some participants also exhibited &quot;doubt&quot;, responding in accordance with their perception, but questioning their own judgment while nonetheless sticking to their (correct) response, expressing this as needing to behave as they had been asked to do in the task.

==== Attitudes of responders conforming on one or more trials ====
Participants who conformed to the majority on at least 50% of trials reported reacting with what Asch called a &quot;distortion of perception&quot;. These participants, who made up a distinct minority (only 12 subjects), expressed the belief that the actors&#x27; answers were correct, and were apparently unaware that the majority were giving incorrect answers.

Among the other participants who yielded on some trials, most expressed what Asch termed &quot;distortion of judgment&quot;. These participants concluded after a number of trials that they must be wrongly interpreting the stimuli and that the majority must be right, leading them to answer with the majority. These individuals were characterized by low levels of confidence. The final group of participants who yielded on at least some trials exhibited a &quot;distortion of action&quot;. These subjects reported that they knew what the correct answer was, but conformed with the majority group simply because they didn&#x27;t want to seem out of step by not going along with the rest. All conforming respondents underestimated the frequency with which they conformed to the majority.

== Variations on the original paradigm ==
In subsequent research experiments, Asch explored several variations on the paradigm from his 1951 study.

In 1955 he reported on work with 123 male students from three different universities. A second paper in 1956 also consisted of 123 male college students from three different universities. Asch did not state if this was in fact the same sample as reported in his 1955 paper; the principal difference is that the 1956 paper includes an elaborate account of his interviews with participants. Across all these papers, Asch found the same results: participants conformed to the majority group in about one-third of all critical trials.

;Presence of a true partner
:Asch found that the presence of a &quot;true partner&quot; (a &quot;real&quot; participant or another actor told to give the correct response to each question) decreased conformity. In studies that had one actor give correct responses to the questions, only 5% of the participants continued to answer with the majority. In subsequent interviews, subjects claimed a degree of &quot;warmth&quot; and &quot;closeness&quot; towards the partner, and attributed an increase in confidence to their presence. Still, subjects rejected the notion that it was the partner who allowed them to answer independently.

=== Partner dissent and accuracy ===
:Experiments were also designed to determine if the partner effect on subject conformity was due to the partner&#x27;s dissent from the majority or their accuracy in answering questions. In one experiment, Asch identified two classes of dissenter: &quot;extremist&quot; (under this condition, dissenters always chose the worst of the comparison lines and the majority chose the line closest to the standard in length) and &quot;compromising&quot; (dissenter: closest to standard; majority: worst comparison line). In compromising dissenter trials, subject conformity decreased overall and when they did conform, they conformed to the dissenter, not the majority. Compromising dissenters were seen to control the &quot;choice of errors&quot;. In trials with an extremist dissenter, subject conformity decreased dramatically with only 9% of respondents continuing to answer with the majority. Therefore, partner dissent was found to increase independence, moderating errors (conformity). 
;Withdrawal of a partner
:Asch also examined whether the removal of a true partner partway through the experiment influenced participants&#x27; level of conformity. He found low levels of conformity during the first half of the experiment. However, halfway through the experiment the partner rejoined the majority, answering in lockstep with the group. When their partner switched, the subject conformity rose to levels consistent to if they had never had a partner at all. Asch classified this finding as a &quot;desertion&quot; effect. In a variant of this study, the partner left the experiment halfway-through altogether (an excuse was provided for their departure). Under these conditions, the partner&#x27;s influence lingered through the second half of the experiment; the subject&#x27;s conformity to the group increased after the partner&#x27;s departure, but not as drastically if the partner was perceived as having switched sides.
;Majority size
:Asch also examined whether decreasing or increasing the majority size had an influence on participants&#x27; level of conformity. When paired with a single individual who opposed their answers, the subject retained high levels of independence in their answers. Increasing the opposing group to two or three persons increased conformity substantially. Increases beyond three persons (e.g., four, five, six, etc.) did not further-increase conformity.
;Written responses
:Asch also varied the method of participants&#x27; responding in studies where actors verbalized their responses aloud but the &quot;real&quot; participant responded in writing at the end of each trial. Conformity significantly decreased when shifting from public to written responses.

=== Degree of wrongness ===
:Another research question examined by Asch was whether varying the magnitude of majority &quot;wrongness&quot; affected subject conformity to group norms. To answer this question, the difference between the reference line and three comparison lines was systematically increased to determine if there was a point where the extremity of the majority&#x27;s error affected subject conformity. The authors failed to find a point at which subject conformity to the majority was completely eliminated, even when the disparity between lines was increased to 7 inches.
: ----The Role of the Asch Experiment and Social Interaction In the replication of the Asch Experiment, particularly in studies within the field of economics, the impact of monetary incentives has been investigated. Although the rewards used in the replication may bear less resemblance to real-life decision-making processes, important findings regarding the influence of monetary incentives on group pressure have been obtained. The Influence of Political Views Group pressure&#x27;s impact on political views has been explored in settings akin to the Asch Experiment. These inquiries have demonstrated that group pressure can sway political opinions. The Crutchfield Experiment is noteworthy in this regard as it serves as a tool to comprehend the social sway on political stances. The Crutchfield Experiment elucidates how individuals respond under group pressure and the extent to which their perceptions can be swayed. Participants find themselves alone in a scenario where they evaluate a series of light combinations; however, they are actually privy to the responses of other participants and tend to adhere to group norms. This experiment furnishes a pivotal model for grasping the social influence on political views. The Role of Individual Differences
:Lastly, studies have examined personality traits that resist or succumb to group pressure in Asch experiments. Individual characteristics such as intelligence, self-esteem, and the need for social approval have been scrutinized for their impact on conformity. These studies have illustrated that different personality traits exert varying effects on conformity under group pressure.Individual differences are a topic that allows the study of unique characteristics and behavioral differences between individuals. Researchers such as Crutchfield and others have examined the relationship between personality traits and compliance behavior. For example, low agreeableness rates have been found to be associated with characteristics such as intellectual competence and leadership ability. However, the relationship between intelligence and adaptation is not clear. The effects of self-esteem and the need for social approval on adjustment have also been investigated. The effect of gender on adjustment has also been examined, but the results are conflicting.

== Interpretations ==

=== Normative influence vs. referent informational influence ===
The Asch conformity experiments are often interpreted as evidence for the power of conformity and normative social influence, where normative influence is the willingness to conform publicly to attain social reward and avoid social punishment. From this perspective, the results are viewed as a striking example of people publicly endorsing the group response despite knowing full well that they were endorsing an incorrect response.

Similarly, Jerry M. Burger admits the normative influence effect of the experiment in Chapter 21 of Noba online book. He mentioned that people follow the crowd to avoid potential criticism. During Asch&#x27;s experiment, participants choose the wrong answer to keep the association with the group. The demonstration in this experiment broadens people&#x27;s understanding of the large application of normative influence. To stay consistent with other group members, people may follow a trend that is apparently wrong. Moreover, the behavior of normative conformity may reduce when the individual response is not accessible to other people. This phenomenon further stresses the social role in normative influence.

In contrast, John Turner and colleagues argue that the interpretation of the Asch conformity experiments as normative influence is inconsistent with the data. They point out that post-experiment interviews revealed that participants experienced uncertainty about their judgement during the experiments. Although the correct answer appeared obvious to the researchers, this was not necessarily the experience of participants. Subsequent research has demonstrated similar patterns of conformity where participants were anonymous and thus not subject to social punishment or reward on the basis of their responses. From this perspective, the Asch conformity experiments are viewed as evidence for the self-categorization theory account of social influence (otherwise known as the theory of referent informational influence). Here, the observed conformity is an example of depersonalization processes, whereby people expect to hold the same opinions as others in their ingroup and will often adopt those opinions.

=== Social comparison theory ===

The conformity demonstrated in Asch experiments may contradict aspects of social comparison theory. Social comparison theory suggests that, when seeking to validate opinions and abilities, people will first turn to direct observation. If direct observation is ineffective or not available, people will then turn to comparable others for validation. In other words, social comparison theory predicts that social reality testing will arise when physical reality testing yields uncertainty. The Asch conformity experiments demonstrate that uncertainty can arise as an &quot;outcome&quot; of social reality testing. More broadly, this inconsistency has been used to support the position that the theoretical distinction between social reality testing and physical reality testing is untenable.

== Selective representation in textbooks and the media ==
Asch&#x27;s 1956 report emphasized the predominance of independence over yielding saying &quot;the facts that were being judged were, under the circumstances, the most decisive.&quot; However, a 1990 survey of US social psychology textbooks found that most ignored independence, instead reported a misleading summary of the results as reflecting complete power of the situation to produce conformity of behavior and belief.

A 2015 survey found no change, with just 1 of 20 major texts reporting that most participant-responses defied majority opinion. No text mentioned that 95% of subjects defied the majority at least once. Nineteen of the 20 books made no mention of Asch&#x27;s interview data in which many participants said they were certain all along that the actors were wrong. This portrayal of the Asch studies was suggested to fit with social psychology narratives of situationism, obedience and conformity, to the neglect of recognition of disobedience of immoral commands (e.g., disobedience shown by participants in Milgram Studies), desire for fair treatment (e.g., resistance to tyranny shown by many participants in the Stanford prison studies) and self-determination.

<text>Kazimierz Władysław Bartel (; ; 3 March 1882 – 26 July 1941) was a Polish mathematician, freemason, scholar, diplomat and politician who served as 15th, 17th and 19th Prime Minister of Poland three times between 1926 and 1930 and a Senator of Poland from 1937 until the outbreak of World War II.

Bartel was appointed Minister of Railways between 1919 and 1920, in 1922–1930 he was a member of Poland&#x27;s Sejm. After Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s May Coup d&#x27;état in 1926, he became prime minister and held this post during three broken tenures: 1926, 1928–29, 1929–1930. Bartel was the Deputy Prime Minister between 1926–1928 and Minister of Religious Beliefs and Public Enlightenment, when Piłsudski himself assumed the premiership, however, Bartel was in fact &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister during this period as Piłsudski did not concern himself with the day-to-day functions of the cabinet and the government.

In 1930 upon giving up politics, he returned to the university as professor of mathematics. In 1930 he became rector of the Lwów Polytechnic and was soon awarded an honorary doctorate and membership in the Polish Mathematical Association. In 1937 he was appointed a Senator of Poland and held this post until World War II.

After the Soviet invasion and occupation of eastern Poland, he was allowed to continue lecturing at the Technical Institute. In 1940 he was summoned to Moscow and offered a seat in the Soviet parliament.

On 30 June 1941, in the course of Operation Barbarossa, the German Wehrmacht entered Lwów and began persecuting the local intelligentsia. Bartel was imprisoned two days later by the Gestapo and offered the top post in a Polish puppet government. His ultimate refusal of the German terms was taken as an act of treason by the Germans. By order of Heinrich Himmler, Bartel was murdered on 26 July 1941, shortly after the Massacre of Lwów professors had ended.

==Early life and studies==
Kazimierz Władysław Bartel was born on 3 March 1882 in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary (later Lwów, Poland, now Lviv in Ukraine) as the son of Michał Bartel and Amalia Chadaczek. Growing up in a working-class family, he graduated from elementary school in Stryj. His railwayman father arranged Bartel to be an apprentice to fitter who taught in craft school. This allowed Bartel to continue his formal education while working as an apprentice.

After completing secondary school in 1901, Bartel studied mechanics at the Lwów Polytechnic in the Mechanical Engineering Department. He graduated summa cum laude in 1907 and soon started working for his alma mater as an assistant in descriptive geometry to Placyd Zdzisław Dziwinski. From 1908 to 1909, he also studied mathematics and philosophy at the Franciscan University in Lviv and at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The travel grant to Munich allowed him to attend the lectures on art history by Karl Dochlemann and mathematics by Aurel Voss and Alfred Pringsheim.

He returned to the Polytechnic and earned his doctor of technical sciences in 1909. His dissertation &quot;O utworach szeregów i pęków inwolucyjnych&quot; (Compositions series and involution pencils) allowed him to become one of the first title holders of such doctoral within Austria-Hungary. Bartel gave his habilitation thesis &quot;O płaskich utworach inwolucji stopnia czwartego szeregu zerowego&quot; (On planar products of involution of the fourth series of the zero degree) in 1912, then received the title of associate professor. Bartel became the chair of descriptive geometry after the retirement of Mieczysław Łazarski in 1911 due to blindness. Bartel attained the title of professor of mathematics at the Lwów Polytechnic in 1917.

Conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, after the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 he returned to Lwów, which became part of the newly-established Second Polish Republic. In 1919, as commander of railway troops, he fought in the defence of the city against the Ukrainian siege. Meanwhile, Bartel wrote his first textbook on descriptive geometry and befriended and later supported Poland&#x27;s future leader, marshal and commander-in-chief, Józef Piłsudski. Since May 1919 he served as the manager of the Armoured Trains Construction Management and Association. His numerous successes in this field led to Prime Minister Leopold Skulski appointing him the Minister of the Railway system of the Republic of Poland. Bartel met other significant and influential politicians and diplomats, most notably Prime Minister Wincenty Witos and Prime Minister Władysław Grabski. After the Polish–Soviet War of 1920, Bartel was nominated as a lieutenant colonel and was left in charge of the railway reserve officers and the Lwów militia. He was awarded a Virtuti Militari cross, a Polish distinction for valor, after the armed conflict.

In 1921, Bartel spent six months travelling to museums and galleries in France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria to research on art. Most of his holidays were spent likewise because of his interest stemming from Dochlemann&#x27;s lectures. He accumulated a good personal archive of notes and photographs for this interest of his.

==Political and diplomatic career==
In 1922, Bartel was elected a member of Poland&#x27;s &quot;Sejm&quot; (parliament) and held that position until 1929. Initially, he was a member of the party PSL &quot;Liberation&quot;, but he was not satisfied with the radicalization of the group. In March 1925 at the Congress of the Polish People&#x27;s Party, he decided to adopt, among others, a reform without compensation. Bartel eventually left the party and the organisation in April 1925, along with Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski and Bolesław Wysłouch and later founded the parliamentary &quot;Labour Club&quot;. This organization quickly came under the direct influence of commander-in-chief Józef Piłsudski. Just before the May Coup of 1926, Bartel received an order from Marshal Piłsudski to prepare for a takeover as prime minister after the expected collapse of President Stanisław Wojciechowski and his government.

On 15 May 1926, after the resignation of the government led by Wincenty Witos and President Wojciechowski after the May Coup, Bartel was appointed by Marshal of the Sejm and the acting head of state Maciej Rataj as the prime minister of the Second Polish Republic, but Bartel later stated in his inauguration speech that he would be the head of government only until the election of a new president. His decision was possibly influenced by the fact that he suffered from kidney and stomach problems and was constantly in pain. One member of the parliament stated, &quot;He was a cheerful and ambitious man, but always in pain. Even his opponents in the Sejm admitted that in personal relationships, it is extremely hard not to be in favour of a man like Bartel. As prime minister, he tried to aid every man possible, even the men and women that opposed his policies and the government, but he was not able to help himself, which led to his early decline in politics and diplomacy of the Polish Republic. He was of weak stature and of weak health and would hardly make a good impression on the public, especially the socialists or communists in the east and therefore, this would not make him an influential Prime Minister nor a diplomat supporting democracy.&quot;
Bartel&#x27;s new government consisted mostly of people not connected with any political parties (four of those politicians already were occupied ministerial positions). Bartel was described as ideologically centrist: Prime Minister&#x27;s newly established office was occupied by both the right-wing and left-wing leaders. Bartel himself took over the Ministry in turn and Piłsudski the Minister of War. Such a system churned mainly the Polish Socialist Party, which supported the May Coup. On 16 May 1926, Prime Minister Bartel made a statement in which he highlighted the principles of his policies. Bartel stated that the cabinet took power in accordance with the law, without any prejudice to the constitutional order. He also called for peace, hard work and dedication to the Polish nation. At the same time, he promised the immediate removal of incompetent and corrupt politicians from any high posts that could negatively influence the future economic growth of the Second Polish Republic. Bartel&#x27;s closest personal advisor in politics and diplomacy was Marshal Józef Piłsudski, who was in favour of the new minister.

Bartel suggested that Ignacy Mościcki should become a candidate for the post of head of state (president), who was also a professor at the Lwów Polytechnic. Bartel&#x27;s first government was one of the most active in the history of Poland; the politicians and members of parliament gathered every second day and on occasions everyday to discuss political matters. On 4 June 1926, Ignacy Mościcki was elected the president of the Second Polish Republic, and Bartel resigned along with the entire cabinet, but soon after being appointed, President Mościcki designated him again to become prime minister.

===Second and third government (1926)===
On 8 June 1926, three days after the Mościcki&#x27;s designation, Bartel formed his second cabinet. On the same day, Józef Piłsudski sent a letter to the head office in which he outlined the conditions of re-entry to the parliament. After his second election, Bartel primarily focused on the restoration of the decree based on the organization of the highest military authorities from 7 January 1921, which enables the free management of the Ministry of War without the vote of the government and the parliament. On 9 June 1926, the decree was officially restored, however, another decree was adopted, which increased the power of the president or head of state over the ministry. Bartel met with representatives of the parliamentary clubs and highlighted in a conversation with them his commitment towards the parliamentary system but also pointed out a more concerning issue:the economic development of the country. At a private meeting with senators, he highlighted his determination and involvement in fighting against bureaucracy, the introduction of an apolitical army and the elimination of the Ministry of Public Works. He vividly stated that before the May Coupn there was no democracy and that Poland was ruled by an oligarchy, nobles and influential leaders of wealthy privately-owned clubs and parties.

The supporters of Bartel and his government emphasized his efficiency when they managed the state. His opponents, however, saw it as a tool to limit the role of the Polish Parliament and accused him of deliberate dictatorship and control over the ministers in his &quot;private parliament sittings&quot; - the so-called &quot;Sejm Bartlowy&quot; (Bartel&#x27;s Parliament). Bartel was appointed prime minister when Marshal Piłsudski undertook an attempt to communicate with the rebellious senators and members of the Sejm. Bartel himself was considered to be representative of the liberal tendencies in the party and a spokesman of the Sanacja movement. Otherwise the post of the head of government (Prime Minister) was taken by Kazimierz Świtalski or Walery Sławek, both of whom were considered to be uncompromising supporters of the conflict with the parliament.

Bartel&#x27;s government contributed to a marked improvement in administration, which was primarily caused by the Prime Minister&#x27;s organizational skills and knowledge. He created an efficient system of government action in connection with the Sejm and officials of lower rank: &quot;The ministers of the previous governments generally considered themselves as autonomous rulers, which influenced the private interests of the members of different parties in charge. The government of Kazimierz Bartel was never focused or concentrated on any political ties and friendships. The officials of the Prime Minister were to validate the efficiency of each ministry. Each minister was responsible for the operation of his office and ministers could not engage in any political activities. Before his speech in the parliament on any topic, he had to submit the text to the Prime Minister himself for approval. Bartel demanded such procedures from every minister and senator of his cabinet and personally prepared the agenda for each meeting of the government and disallowed to discuss any topic without his permission or consent.&quot;

Bartel also tried to improve the situation of the Polish Jews and the Jewish minority around the country. He was determined to eliminate the remnants of regulations dating back to the times of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Congress Poland, focused on the persecution of religious minorities, especially the Jews and the Gypsies. Bartel&#x27;s cabinet announced that it is against such inhumane procedures and actions, and in 1927 the Prime Minister gave permission to adopt a law officially recognizing and granting rights to the Jewish communities. Bartel was also against enforcing certain laws to the nature of the economic sanctions imposed on the Jews.
On 2 August 1926, the Parliament adopted an amendment to the Constitution (the so-called &quot;August Novella&quot;), significantly strengthening the role of the president. On 20 September 1926 the Christian Democratic Party raised a vote against two ministers in the government of Bartel: Antoni Sujkowski and Kazimierz Młodzianowski. The party accused them of carrying out political purges in the state administration. Eventually, the vote was passed by the government, which forced Bartel and his cabinet to resign, but Marshal Piłsudski ordered President Mościcki to appoint Bartel as prime minister. Once more, that was not in violation of the Constitution, but the anti-parliamentarian speakers and the socialist politicians, confused with the frequent changes in the administration and the government, threatened the Sejm and even suggested a rebellion or another coup. The conflict made Bartel&#x27;s third new cabinet last only four days.

On 30 September at the Belvedere palace in Warsaw, the council was holding a meeting in the study room, during which it was decided to dissolve the third government. Therefore, Bartel received the document on this subject, which for its validity required President Mościcki&#x27;s signature. Meanwhile, the Senate immediately demanded that the parliament passes the budget cut policy proposed by the Upper House. Bartel told the Speaker of the Sejm Maciej Rataj, that in such a situation he will personally take the decree to Mościcki and ask for his signature. After the Sejm passed the budget cut policy, Bartel arrived at Mościcki&#x27;s private residence, but to his surprise, Mościcki refused to sign the document allowing the dissolution. Instead, he ordered Bartel to terminate his employment. Bartel was once again forced to resign, but this time his cabinet would stay intact and his place would be taken by the marshal himself. The former prime minister was very bitter about this turn of events, despite the fact he went along with Piłsudski&#x27;s and Rataj&#x27;s plans. In its course, the Marshal warned that, in contrast to the previous government, he will not be &quot;competing&quot; with the ministers and if necessary he will use force if the members would not agree to his radical policies.

===Collaboration with Piłsudski&#x27;s Council===
Following his resignation, Bartel was to become the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment in Piłsudski&#x27;s own, private council that operated in case of any unexpected conflict with the current operating government. The Marshal did not devote much attention towards his cabinet, focusing primarily on military and foreign policies. It was Kazimierz Bartel that was to replace the Marshal and take over his duties if absent and become the Speaker of the Sejm. He often spoke, as a representative of the government, on matters related to the budget and finances. These topics were possibly the main subject of a dispute between the &quot;Piłsudskites&quot; and the parliamentary opposition.

After the elections in March 1928, Piłsudski decided that Kazimierz Bartel should be appointed to the position of Speaker of the Sejm. On 27 March the &quot;Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government&quot; (BBWR), an ostensibly non-political organization that existed from 1928 to 1935, closely affiliated with Józef Piłsudski and his Sanacja movement, declared Bartel&#x27;s candidacy. However Piłsudski&#x27;s plan to place Bartel in charge of the Sejm and nominate him as Marshal Speaker failed, because the senators and members of parliament decided to choose Ignacy Daszyński of the Polish Socialist Party as the Marshal of the Sejm instead. In protest, following the results of the vote, the members and supporters of the parliamentary BBWR party left the room.

The year 1928 also marked the release of his first book &quot;Perspektywa Malarska&quot;. It dealt with the basic theory of perspective and its extension to architecture and art. It was published by Ksiaznica-Atlas, a publisher in Lwów who provided the negatives for the German translation published by B.G. Teubner in 1934.

===Second term in office (1928–1929)===
As soon as the new government was formed without Kazimierz Bartel as its head, Józef Piłsudski, temporarily serving as Prime Minister of the country, resigned. He decided, however, that his position will be taken over by Kazimierz Bartel, considered his most trusted and most loyal friend and supporter among the members of the party, although this change was only formal – Bartel was already responsible for leading the ongoing work of the Council of Ministers, even if he was not the Head of Cabinet. Piłsudski&#x27;s decision greatly dissatisfied the senators of parliament, who would simply demonstrate their anger by not participating in the sessions and sittings of the Sejm. Some politicians dared to even throw rotten food at the ministers that were leaving the voting chamber. The situation worsened in the upcoming months and some ministers raised concerns about their safety, as some demonstrators, often made up of ordinary citizens working on the behalf of the party, tended to physically abuse officials travelling from their homes to the newly constructed government building located on Wiejska Street in Warsaw. Similar events occurred during the inauguration of the first President of the Second Polish Republic, Gabriel Narutowicz, in December 1922. The politicians and ministers were advised to travel with guards, police or at least a weapon that they could defend themselves with, however, the use of weapons may have strengthened the unity of the opposition and of the demonstrators that could use this as an act of violence against the common people and a violation of social democracy.

After the beginning of the so-called &quot;Czechowicz affair&quot; in which the opposition discovered that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gabriel Czechowicz, a strong admirer of Piłsudski, passed 8 million Polish złoty from the state budget for the BBWR campaign between 1927 and 1928, on 12 February 1929 the members of an anti-Sanacja movement have requested to place both Czechowicz and Bartel before the State Tribunal (Court). In protest against this decision, Kazimierz Bartel informed the press of his intention to resign. He also stated that in his opinion the Czechowicz affair was caused by the Parliament and its senators rather than by the doings of one politician. On 13 April 1929 Bartel ordered his government to resign. He was replaced by Kazimierz Świtalski, a stubborn and self-centred man considered to be the cause of relentless struggle with the parliamentary opposition. The following months were marked by disputes between the newly formed government and the Sejm. Bartel&#x27;s new cabinet began operating on 5 November 1929, however, its first sitting occurred in December on the orders of President Mościcki. After this, the Parliament adopted a motion of no confidence against Świtalski&#x27;s Cabinet. Kazimierz Bartel became the prime minister once again.

===Third term in office (1929–1930)===

On 29 December 1929, Bartel was chosen for the third time to be prime minister and formed his fifth government and cabinet, however, he performed his duties with large uncertainties, mainly due to poor health. He had kidney illness and had a ureterolithotomy with help from Tadeusz Pisarski, a urologist he befriended during their conscription in the army. He also suffered from depression and anxiety probably due to the constant disputes with the Sejm and its senators. On 10 January he appeared at a meeting with members of parliament, declaring his willingness to cooperate with the senators and the Sejm, saying &quot;I come with good will and determination gentlemen!&quot; Bartel initially managed to establish cooperation with the Sejm, which resulted in the stabilization of the entire situation and conflict. Later, however, the relations between the cabinet and the parliament deteriorated again. The apogee of another dispute was a request for the adoption of no-confidence motion against the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Aleksander Prystor. That was done primarily through the initiative of the Polish Socialist Party headed by Ignacy Daszyński and his supporters like Bolesław Limanowski, a Polish socialist politician, historian journalist and advocate of agrarianism who was the oldest member of the Polish Senate until his death in 1935 at the age of 99.

On 12 March Bartel gave a speech in the Senate sharply attacking the senators, which were &quot;not able to fulfill the tasks set in order to control the state and the country and that their stubbornness and pride in themselves was an astonishing blow to both the economy and the policies of Poland.&quot; He also stated that &quot;being a member of parliament is a profession. It does not require the members to acquire any skills and create new damaging campaigns, only to obey the ruling party. A man focused only on work and career often becomes a man in conflict with others, which entails long political consequences.&quot; Bartel believed that the motion of no confidence towards one member of the Senate was the lack of support of the entire government. On 15 March 1930, he decided to leave the office and his resignation was accepted by the president the next day. Soon, he also resigned from his parliamentary seat and left politics. Walery Sławek was appointed the new prime minister of Poland.

==Post-candidacy and return to university==
After retiring from political life, he returned to the Technical University of Lwów (Polytechnic). In the same year he was elected rector of the university and held that office in the academic year of 1930/1931. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate and membership of the Polish Academy of Sciences: in the years 1930-1932 he was president of the Polish Mathematical Society. During this time he published his most important works, including a series of lectures on the perspective of European painting. It was the first such publication in the world. During his work at the Technical University of Lwów, he expressed strong opposition to plans focused on introducing the so-called &quot;ghetto benches&quot; for students of Jewish origin and ethnicity to separate them from Polish and Christian peers. His opinions, as well as other actions against anti-Semitic students, made Bartel the subject of numerous attacks including throwing eggs and rotten food at the professor or bringing a pig with the sign &quot;Bartel&quot; by Polish nationalists to the university grounds.

In 1932, he testified as a witness in the Brest trials, lasting from 26 October 1931 to 13 January 1932, held at the Warsaw Regional Court where leaders of the Centrolew, a &quot;centre-Left&quot; anti-Sanacja political opposition movement, were tried. In 1937, Bartel was appointed Senator of Poland by the President to replace the deceased Emil Bobrowski, and served until the outbreak of World War II. In the autumn of 1938, he was one of the signatories of a document addressed to President Mościcki, which called for the inclusion of representatives of the opposition to the government in connection with the threat of the country&#x27;s independence. The document also postulated amnesty for politicians of the opposition, who were forced into exile or were imprisoned after the Brest trials. Bartel handed over a memorandum to Mościcki, however, Mościcki did not respond to the proposals. In February 1939 Bartel delivered a speech in the Senate, which has gained wide publicity in the country. In it, he sharply criticized the situation in universities and colleges around Poland; mentioned the widespread anti-Semitism there; and the failed organization of studies, subjects and courses.

==World War II==

In September 1939, during the defence of Lwów just before the attack of the German troops, Kazimierz Bartel served as the head of the Civic Committee. When Lwów became occupied by the Soviet Union, he was allowed to continue his lectures at the Technical University. In July 1940 he was, along with several other politicians and professors, summoned to Moscow, where he took part in an All-Committee meeting of Universities of the Soviet Union. Conversations and topics mentioned mostly related scientific issues, and Bartel signed a contract with a publishing house to write a textbook of Science and Geometry for the schools of the Soviet Union. He also visited the scientific and cultural institutions like the Tretyakov Gallery and the Institute of Architecture in Moscow. There are some conflicting reports about whether during his stay in Moscow, the Soviets offered him political cooperation. According to some of his closest friends, Stalin issued a proposal for the creation of a new Polish government, but Bartel rejected it. As he wrote to his wife on 16 July 1941: &quot;By listening to private conversations of the officers, I conclude that my position as Prime Minister may be resurrected, but what great duty this will be to control a split, communist country. In Moscow with Joseph Stalin, I had the pleasure of finding out new information from the West - Winston Churchill&#x27;s speech addressed to Władysław Sikorski about Poland&#x27;s supposed future.&quot;

One of the editions of &quot;Paris&#x27; Historical Notebooks&quot; described the content of the letter sent to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It stated that Müller, the Deputy Head of the Security Police and Security Service (Reinhard Heydrich) believed that Bartel negotiated in early 1941 with the Soviet authorities about the establishment of a new nation that together with the Soviet Union was to declare war on Nazi Germany. Similar information can be found, among others, in a telegram sent by the Polish Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Switzerland to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London dating from 26 September 1940: &quot;It&#x27;s believed that Moscow professor Bartel has intention to create the Red Government of Poland.&quot; This information, however, was never proved to be true. Meanwhile, Maria Bartlowa, the wife of former prime minister, stated that her husband was talking only with the Soviets on the release of his new lecture book. It is also widely believed that Kazimierz Bartel never met Stalin in person.

The Prime Minister-in-exile stationing in London, General Władysław Sikorski, had plans to co-operate with Bartel and appoint him an ambassador. Sikorski recognized him as one of the few people from the former political circles who would agree to cooperate on the terms and conditions of the British government. On 19 June 1941 Bartel&#x27;s candidacy was officially reported by Sikorski during a meeting of the Council of Ministers. The decision was motivated by the political loyalty of the former prime minister, as well as his successful efforts to preserve the Polish character of the Lwów Polytechnic under Soviet occupation. Sikorski, however, failed to find Bartel in the Soviet Union, and Stanisław Kot was appointed ambassador instead.

===Arrest and death===
On 30 June 1941, soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, the Wehrmacht entered Lwów. Bartel was arrested on 2 July at a meeting with co-workers at the University. Thirty-six other colleagues in the faculty were arrested the next night. Bartel was taken initially to a Gestapo prison on Pelczyńska Street. There, as mentioned by inmate Antoni Stefanowicz, he was treated properly. The former prime minister was allowed to receive, send letters and mathematical books and papers to his wife, and bring food from home. At the time, Bartel was not questioned, because there were some issues regarding the accusations made by the Gestapo. On 21 July, however, he was transferred to a prison at Łąckiego Street, where he was treated poorly. The guards called him a Commie-Jew, as reported by Stefanowicz, and the Nazi officials ordered Bartel to clean the boots of a Ukrainian Hilfsgestapo soldier. Stefanowicz reported that Bartel was mentally devastated and could not understand the essence of the tragedy.

According to some sources, the Nazi officials proposed the establishment of a Polish puppet government dependent on the Reich. Such information was given by General Sikorski during a press conference in Cairo in November 1941 (on the way to Moscow). According to his version, Bartel refused and on the orders of Heinrich Himmler was executed on the 26 July 1941 at dawn. He was shot probably near &quot;Piaski Janowskie&quot; in the context of the Massacre of Lwów professors. Being barred from her daily delivery of food to her husband on Saturday, June 26, Bartel&#x27;s wife learned of his death the following Monday.

According to one account, during the night of October 1943 the Sonderkommando composed of Jewish prisoners unearthed the bodies of the murdered Polish professors that were filed in a mass grave. It was carried out to remove the traces of the murder in connection with the approaching Soviet troops. On 9 October 1943, the corpses were piled. The prisoners were forced to take any personal belongings and clothes, including documents of Kazimierz Bartel and Professor Tadeusz Ostrowski. Later the pile of corpses was set on fire and in the following days the Sonderkommando scattered the ashes on the surrounding fields.

In 1966, on the 25th anniversary of the execution of Lwów professors, a plaque with the names of the victims of Nazism was placed on the church of St. Francis of Assisi in Kraków. Next to the memorial there is also a separate epitaph in honour of Kazimierz Bartel.

==After death==
Knowing the importance that Bartel gave to his work on perspective, his wife saved his manuscript after his death by begging from the Nazi officials. Bartel&#x27;s library of books were either shipped with some pieces of furniture to Germany or burned with his personal papers. His second book was supposed to be published first in German by B. G. Teubner, who would provide Ksiaznica-Atlas the negatives for the Polish edition. However, war delayed the printing and ultimately caused the destruction of all materials. In the 1950s, the second book was reconstructed in the 1950s by Professor F. Otto of the University of Gdansk using the surviving manuscript and the printer&#x27;s proofs which Teubner had sent for Bartel&#x27;s approval. It dealt with analyzing pictures geometrically, artistic reconstruction of geometry exhibited in pictures, and tracing art history using tenets of his theory of perspective. A uniform series was released by Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe, the second book in 1958 and the first volume in 1960.

==Honours and awards==
He was decorated with, among others, the Order of the White Eagle (1932) for outstanding achievements, the French Legion of Honour (class I), the Cross of Valour, the Cross of Independence and the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari (1922).

<doc id="641954" wikidata="Q293497" url="?curid=641954" title="Al-Jahiz">
<text>Abu Uthman Amr ibn Bahr al-Kinani al-Basri (; ), commonly known as al-Jahiz (), was an Arab polymath and author of works of literature (including theory and criticism), theology, zoology, philosophy, grammar, dialectics, rhetoric, philology, linguistics, and politico-religious polemics. His extensive zoological work has been credited with describing principles related to natural selection, ethology, and the functions of an ecosystem.

Ibn al-Nadim lists nearly 140 titles attributed to al-Jahiz, of which 75 are extant. The best known are &quot;Kitāb al-Ḥayawān&quot; (The book of the Animal), a seven-part compendium on an array of subjects with animals as their point of departure; &quot;Kitāb al-Bayān wa-l-tabyīn&quot; (The book of eloquence and exposition), a wide-ranging work on human communication; and &quot;Kitāb al-Bukhalāʾ&quot; (The book of misers), a collection of anecdotes on stinginess. Tradition claims that he was smothered to death when a vast amount of books fell over him.

==Life== 
The actual name of al-Jahiz was Abū ʿUthman ʿAmr ibn Bahr ibn Maḥbūb. His grandfather, Maḥbūb, was a protégé or &quot;mawali&quot; of ‘Amr ibn Qal‘ al-Kinānī, who was from Arab Banu Kinanah tribe. Not much is known about al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27;s early life, but his family was very poor. Born in Basra early in 160/February 776, he asserted in a book he wrote that he was a member of the Banu Kinanah. However, the grandfather of al-Jāḥiẓ was reportedly a Black &quot;jammāl&quot; (cameleer) or &quot;ḥammāl&quot; (porter); the manuscripts differof ‘Amr ibn Qal‘ named Maḥbūb, nicknamed Fazārah, or Fazārah was his maternal grandfather, and Maḥbūb his paternal. The names may however have been confused. His nephew also reported that al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27;s grandfather was a black cameleer. In the early Islamic Arabia, the designation of Black ( Arabic: السودان &quot;as-swadan&quot;) was used to describe people like Zuṭṭ and Zanj, and based on this, several scholars have stated that al-Jahiz descended from one of these black communities, with some even suggesting that he was possibly of African descent. 

He sold fish along one of the canals in Basra to help his family. Financial difficulties, however, did not stop al-Jāḥiẓ from continuously seeking knowledge. He used to gather with a group of other youths at Basra&#x27;s main mosque, where they would discuss different scientific subjects. During the cultural and intellectual revolution under the Abbasid Caliphate books became readily available, and learning accessible. Al-Jāḥiẓ studied philology, lexicography and poetry from among the most learned scholars at the School of Basra, where he attended the lectures of Abū Ubaydah, al-Aṣma’ī, Sa&#x27;īd ibn Aws al-Anṣārī and studied &quot;ilm an-naḥw&quot; (, i.e., syntax) with Akhfash al-Awsaṭ (al-Akhfash Abī al-Ḥasan).
Over a twenty-five-year span studying, al-Jāḥiẓ acquired a considerable knowledge of Arabic poetry, Arabic philology, pre-Islamic Arab history, the Qur&#x27;an and the Hadiths. He read translated books on Greek sciences and Hellenistic philosophy, especially that of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Al-Jahiz was also critical of those who followed the Hadiths of Abu Hurayra, referring to his Hadithist opponents as &quot;al-nabita&quot; (&quot;the contemptible&quot;).

Al-Jāḥiẓ died 250 [A.D. 869], during the caliphate of al-Mu‘tazz. Al-Nadīm reports that al-Jāḥiẓ said he was about the same age as Abū Nuwās and older than al-Jammāz.

==Career==
While still in Basra, al-Jāḥiẓ wrote an article about the institution of the Caliphate. This is said to have been the beginning of his career as a writer, which would become his sole source of living. It is said that his mother once offered him a tray full of notebooks and told him he would earn his living from writing. He went on to write two hundred books in his lifetime on a variety of subjects, including on the Quran, Arabic grammar, zoology, poetry, lexicography, and rhetoric. Al-Jāḥiẓ was also one of the first Arabic writers to suggest a complete overhaul of the language&#x27;s grammatical system, though this would not be undertaken until his fellow linguist Ibn Maḍāʾ took up the matter two hundred years later. 
Al-Nadīm cited this passage from a book of al-Jāḥiẓ:When I was writing these two books, about the creation of the Qur’ān, which was the tenet given importance and honour by the Commander of the Faithful, and another about superiority in connection with the Banū Hāshim, the ‘Abd Shams, and Makhzūm. What was my due but to sit above the Simakān, Spica and Arcturus, or on top of the ‘Ayyūq, or to deal with red sulphur, or to conduct the ‘Anqā by her leading string to the Greatest King. 

Al-Jāḥiẓ moved to Baghdad, then the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, in 816 AD, because the caliphs encouraged scientists and scholars and had just founded the library of the Bayt al-Ḥikmah. But al-Nadim suspected al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27;s claim that the caliph al-Ma’mūn had praised his books on the imamate and the caliphate, for his eloquent phraseology, and use of market-place speech, and that of the elite and of the kings, was exaggerated self-glorification and doubted that al-Ma’mūn could have spoken these words. Al-Jāḥiẓ was said to have admired the eloquent literary style of the director of the library, Sahl ibn Hārūn (d. 859/860) and quoted his works. Because of the caliphs&#x27; patronage and his eagerness to establish himself and reach a wider audience, al-Jāḥiẓ stayed in Baghdad.

Al-Nadīm gives two versions of an anecdote which differ in their source: his first source is Abū Hiffān and his second is the grammarian al-Mubarrad, and retells the story of al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27;s reputation for being one of the three great bibliophiles and scholarsthe two others being al-Fatḥ ibn Khāqān and judge Ismā’īl ibn Isḥāq such that “whenever a book came into the hand of al-Jāḥiẓ he read through it, wherever he happened to be. He even used to rent the shops of &quot;al-warrāqūn&quot; for study.”

Al-Jāḥiẓ replaced Ibrāhīm ibn al-‘Abbās al-Ṣūlī in the government secretariat of al-Ma’mūn but left after just three days. Later at Samarra he wrote a huge number of his books. The caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun wanted al-Jāḥiẓ to teach his children, but then changed his mind when his children were frightened by al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27;s boggle-eyes (). This is said to be the origin of his nickname. He enjoyed the patronage of al-Fath ibn Khaqan, the bibliophile boon companion of Caliph al-Mutawakkil, but after his murder in December 861 he left Samarra for his native Basra, where he lived on his estate with his “concubine, her maid, a manservant, and a donkey.” 

==Selected books==

===Kitāb al-Ḥayawān () &#x27;book of the animal&#x27;===
&quot;Kitāb al-Ḥayawān&quot; is an extensive zoological encyclopedia in seven volumes consisting of anecdotes, proverbs,and descriptions of over 350 animal species. Including in-depth analyses of their ecosystems and behaviors. Composed in honour of Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd al-Mālik al-Zayyāt, who paid him five thousand gold coins. The 11th-century scholar al-Khatib al-Baghdadi dismissed it as &quot;little more than a plagiarism&quot; of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb al-Hayawān&quot;a charge of plagiarism was levelled against Aristotle himself with regard to a certain &quot;Asclepiades of Pergamum&quot;. Later scholars have noted that there was only a limited Aristotelian influence in al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27;s work, and that al-Baghdadi may have been unacquainted with Aristotle&#x27;s work.

Conway Zirkle, writing about the history of natural selection science in 1941, said that an excerpt from this work was the only relevant passage he had found from an Arabian scholar. He provided a quotation describing the struggle for existence, citing a Spanish translation of this work:

The rat goes out for its food, and is clever in getting it, for it eats all animals inferior to it in strength&quot;, and in turn, it &quot;has to avoid snakes and birds and serpents of prey, who look for it in order to devour it&quot; and are stronger than the rat. Mosquitos &quot;know instinctively that blood is the thing which makes them live&quot; and when they see an animal, &quot;they know that the skin has been fashioned to serve them as food&quot;. In turn, flies hunt the mosquito &quot;which is the food that they like best&quot;, and predators eat the flies. &quot;All animals, in short, can not exist without food, neither can the hunting animal escape being hunted in his turn. Every weak animal devours those weaker than itself. Strong animals cannot escape being devoured by other animals stronger than they. And in this respect, men do not differ from animals, some with respect to others, although they do not arrive at the same extremes. In short, God has disposed some human beings as a cause of life for others, and likewise, he has disposed the latter as a cause of the death of the former.&quot;

According to Frank Edgerton (2002), the claim made by some authors that al-Jahiz was an early evolutionist is &quot;unconvincing&quot;, but the narrower claim that Jahiz &quot;recognized the effect of environmental factors on animal life&quot; seems valid. Rebecca Stott (2013) writes of al-Jahiz&#x27;s work:

Jahiz was not concerned with argument or theorizing. He was concerned with witnessing; he promoted the pleasures and fascinations of close looking and told his readers that there was nothing more important than this. ... Here and there amid the close looking there are visions, glimpses of brilliant insight and perception about natural laws, but the overt purpose of &quot;Living beings&quot; was to persuade the reader to fulfil his moral obligation to God, an obligation enjoined by the Qu&#x27;ran: to look closely and search for understanding. ... If certain historians have claimed that Jahiz wrote about evolution a thousand years before Darwin and that he discovered natural selection, they have misunderstood. Jahiz was not trying to work out how the world began or how species had come to be. He believed that God had done the making and that he had done it brilliantly. He took divine creation and intelligent design for granted. … There was, for him, no other possible explanation. ... What is striking, however, about Jahiz’s portrait of nature in &quot;Living Beings&quot; is his vision of interconnectedness, his repeated images of nets and webs. He certainly saw ecosystems, as we would call them now, in the natural world. He also understood what we might call the survival of the fittest.

Like Aristotle, al-Jahiz believed in spontaneous generation. He frequently used metaphors of webs and nets to express the interconnectedness of the natural world.

===Kitāb al-Bukhalā’ () &#x27;the book of misers&#x27; (a.k.a. &#x27;avarice and the avaricious&#x27;)===
A collection of stories about the greedy. Humorous and satirical, it is the best example of al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27; prose style. Al-Jāḥiẓ ridicules schoolmasters, beggars, singers and scribes for their greedy behavior. Many of the stories continue to be reprinted in magazines throughout the Arabic-speaking world. The book is considered one of the best works of al-Jāḥiẓ. The book has two English translations: One by Robert Bertram Serjeant titled &quot;The Book of Misers&quot;, and another by Jim Colville titled &quot;Avarice and the Avaricious&quot;. Editions: Arabic (al-Ḥājirī, Cairo, 1958); Arabic text, French preface. &quot;Le Livre des avares&quot;. (Pellat. Paris, 1951)

=== Kitāb al-Bayān wa-al-Tabyīn &#x27;The Book of eloquence and demonstration&#x27; ===
&quot;al-Bayan wa al-Tabyin&quot; was one of al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27;s later works, in which he wrote on epiphanies, rhetorical speeches, sectarian leaders, and princes. The book is considered to have started Arabic literary theory in a formal, systemic fashion. Al-Jāḥiẓ&#x27;s defining of eloquence as the ability of the speaker to deliver an effective message while maintaining it as brief or elaborate at will was widely accepted by later Arabic literary critics.

=== Fakhr al-Sūdān ala al-Bīḍān () &#x27;pride of blacks over whites&#x27; ===
This book is composed as a debate between black people and white people as to which group is superior. Al-Jāḥiẓ mentions that Blacks have an oratory and eloquence of their own culture and language.

==On the Zanj (&quot;Swahili coast&quot;)==
Concerning the Zanj, he wrote:


==Mu‘tazilī theological debate==
Al-Jāḥiẓ intervened in a theological dispute between two Mu’tazilītes, and defended Abū al-Hudhayl against the criticism of Bishr ibn al-Mu‘tamir. Another Mu‘tazilite theologian, Ja‘far ibn Mubashshir, wrote a “refutation of al-Jāḥiẓ”.

According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, he was &quot;part of the rationalist Mu’tazilite school of theology supported by the caliph al-Maʾmūn and his successor. When Muʿtazilism was abandoned by the caliph al-Mutawakkil, al-Jāḥiẓ remained in favour by writing essays such as Manāqib at-turk (Eng. trans., “Exploits of the Turks”).

==Death==
Al-Jāḥiẓ returned to Basra with hemiplegia after spending more than fifty years in Baghdad. He died in Basra in the Arabic month of Muharram in AH 255/December 868 – January 869 AD. His exact cause of death is not clear, but a popular assumption is that al-Jāḥiẓ died in his private library after one of many large piles of books fell on him, killing him instantly.

== Legal issues and controversies ==
=== Arrests and legal actions ===

On May 15, 1999, Dick drove his car into a utility pole in Hollywood, California. He was charged with possession of cocaine, cannabis, and drug paraphernalia; driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs; and hit-and-run driving. He later pleaded guilty to felony cocaine possession, misdemeanor cannabis possession, and possession of a &quot;smoking device&quot;. The charges were dismissed after Dick completed an 18-month drug diversion program.

On December 4, 2004, Dick was arrested for indecent exposure after he exposed his buttocks at a McDonald&#x27;s outlet.

On July 16, 2008, Dick was arrested in Murrieta, California, on suspicion of drug possession and sexual battery. He exposed the breasts of a 17-year-old girl when he allegedly grabbed and pulled down her tank top and brassiere. During a search of his person, police reported finding a small quantity of cannabis and one alprazolam (Xanax) tablet, for which Dick did not have a prescription. Dick was released from jail after posting $5,000 bail and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery and marijuana possession. He was sentenced to three years probation and around $700 in fines, and was ordered to wear an alcohol-monitoring bracelet for one year.

On January 23, 2010, Dick was arrested at about 4:00a.m. at a bar in Huntington, West Virginia, on suspicion of sexual abuse after reportedly groping a bartender and a patron. He was released from jail after pleading not guilty and posting $60,000 bail. On June 29, 2011, a Cabell County Grand Jury formally indicted Dick for two counts of first-degree sexual abuse. Dick plead not guilty during a formal arraignment in Cabell County Circuit Court, Huntington, on July 29, 2011. Judge Paul Ferrell set a trial date of January 17, 2012. After several delays, on May 21, 2012, Dick was given a six-month pre-trial diversion. An assistant prosecutor said the agreement stated the criminal charges would be dismissed if Dick would stay out of legal trouble for six months. Dick completed the pre-trial diversion program and the charges were dismissed. In January 2012, the two alleged victims filed a civil suit against Dick for unspecified damages.

In June 2018, Dick was charged with misdemeanor sexual battery and battery for allegedly groping a woman in April that year. In October 2019, Dick pleaded not guilty to charges he grabbed an Uber driver by the genitals. He was convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail in November 2022. After his release, he was required to register as a sex offender and attend 52 sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous, pay restitution to the victim, receive mental-health counseling, and attend sessions of Sexual Compulsives Anonymous.

On June 29, 2021, Dick was arrested for felony assault with a deadly weapon; he was released from jail on June 30, 2021, after posting the $50,000 bond.

On May 10, 2022, Dick was arrested for felony sexual battery of a man in Orange County, California. The case was later dropped when the accuser refused to cooperate with local police.

In October 2022, Dick was arrested for felony burglary, allegedly of power tools.

Dick was again arrested in January 2023 for public intoxication and failure to register as a sex offender in Lake Elsinore, California.

=== Other incidents ===

In 1999, Dick was questioned about the suicide of actor David Strickland and identified his body. On March 20 that year, Dick and Strickland flew from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and spent three days partying in strip clubs. Strickland hanged himself with a bed sheet over the ceiling beam and died during the morning of March 22, 1999. He was 29 years old.

In 2005, Dick dropped his pants and exposed his genitals to the audience at Yuk Yuk&#x27;s comedy club in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He was ushered off the stage and the show&#x27;s second night was cancelled.

Dick groped Pamela Anderson during her 2005 Comedy Central roast, saying he was her plastic surgeon and used the premise to repeatedly grab her breasts. During the roast, Dick also attempted to grope Courtney Love, who proceeded to slap him across the face. Dick also mimed performing oral sex on Anderson&#x27;s then-husband Tommy Lee.

At William Shatner&#x27;s 2006 Comedy Central roast, Dick, performing as the lovechild of James T. Kirk and Spock, allegedly licked Farrah Fawcett, Carrie Fisher, and Patton Oswalt before biting &quot;New York Post&quot; reporter Mandy Stadtmiller.

In December 2006, Dick upset an audience at The Improv in Los Angeles by shouting &quot;You&#x27;re all a bunch of niggers!&quot; following an improvised set with comedian Ian Bagg. This was a direct reference to Michael Richards&#x27; use of the same epithet to insult hecklers two weeks earlier. He later issued an apology via his publicist:
In February 2007, during an appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Dick was forcibly removed from the stage after repeatedly touching guest Ivanka Trump. Kimmel called in security guards Uncle Frank and Veatrice Rice, who assisted as Kimmel dragged off Dick by his legs. Kimmel later said: &quot;Andy did a segment, he was a little out of it. [When Ivanka] came out, he wanted a big, wet kiss. It was time for Andy to go, so I escorted him out by his feet ... He always makes me a little uncomfortable, you have no idea what he&#x27;s going to do next.&quot; Kimmel also said he had spoken to Dick afterwards and that Dick was not upset about the incident.

In October 2010, Dick was seen exposing himself and making a commotion at Café Audrey in Hollywood.

In January 2011, Dick was ejected from the AVN Awards, a pornographic movie awards ceremony, after repeatedly groping and stalking adult film actor Tera Patrick and drag queen Chi Chi LaRue.

In April 2011, Dick was at a party connected with Newport Beach Film Festival. He appeared intoxicated, exposed himself, urinated on a backdrop and afterwards destroyed it by pulling it down. The organizers said this caused thousands of dollars of damage and considered suing Dick over the incident.

In August 2011, Dick was a guest on Greg Fitzsimmons&#x27; radio show and made antisemitic statements about Howard Stern, calling Stern a &quot;money-grubbing Jew&quot; and a &quot;hook-nosed Jew&quot;.

In October 2017, Dick was fired from a role in the independent film &quot;Raising Buchanan&quot; due to allegations of inappropriate behavior that, according to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;included groping people&#x27;s genitals, unwanted kissing/licking and sexual propositions of at least four members of the production&quot;. Dick denied most of the allegations and said: &quot;I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them. That&#x27;s my thing – I licked Carrie Fisher at a roast. It&#x27;s me being funny.&quot; In the same month, he was also fired and escorted off the set of the film &quot;Vampire Dad&quot; due to &quot;multiple, flagrant acts of improper conduct and inappropriate contact with several crew members&quot;. He later said: &quot;I overtook my medication and took too many Xanax and I was a bit loopy ... I won&#x27;t do it anymore. I won&#x27;t lick anyone&#x27;s face anymore. We have an agreement.&quot;

In 2019, a man knocked out Dick with a punch to the head, causing him to be sent to a hospital to be monitored for a brain bleed. The man accused Dick of groping him and punched Dick in retaliation.

In April 2022, Dick alleged he was mugged in Las Vegas, presenting with severe facial injuries.

=== Conflict with Jon Lovitz ===
Andy Dick has a longstanding feud with former &quot;NewsRadio&quot; costar Jon Lovitz concerning the death of their mutual friend Phil Hartman. According to Lovitz, Dick had given Hartman&#x27;s wife Brynn cocaine at a Christmas party at Hartman&#x27;s house in 1997; Brynn, a recovering addict, began using drugs again, culminating in her killing of Hartman and her suicide on May 28, 1998. When Lovitz joined the cast of &quot;NewsRadio&quot; as Hartman&#x27;s replacement, he and Dick argued; Lovitz shouted: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be here if you hadn&#x27;t given Brynn coke in the first place&quot;. Lovitz later apologized to Dick for the remark.

Lovitz alleged that in early 2007, Dick approached him at a restaurant and said: &quot;I put the Phil Hartman hex on you – you&#x27;re the next to die&quot;. On July 10, 2007, Dick fought with Lovitz at Laugh Factory in Los Angeles; Lovitz demanded an apology from Dick, who refused and accused Lovitz of blaming him for Hartman&#x27;s death. Lovitz then grabbed Dick by his shirt and slammed him backward into the bar, after which the doorman separated them.

<doc id="641970" wikidata="Q1431609" url="?curid=641970" title="Ala Moana Center">
<text>The Ala Moana Center, commonly known simply as Ala Moana, is a large open-air shopping mall in the Ala Moana neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii. Owned by Brookfield Properties, Ala Moana is the eighth largest shopping mall in the United States and the largest open-air shopping center in the world.

Ala Moana is consistently ranked among the most successful malls in the world. With assets totaling $5.74 billion as of January 2018, it is the most valuable shopping mall in the United States. It is anchored by Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, Marshalls, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Ross Dress for Less, Saks Off 5th, and Target.

==History==
Before the construction of the mall, the land was a wetland. Dredging projects nearby spearheaded by Walter F. Dillingham created excess coral which filled the wetland, purchased by Dillingham in 1912 from the estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop. Land reclaimed, son and successor Lowell Dillingham initiated the Ala Moana Center project in 1948 and broke ground in 1957.

===Initial development and design===
The Ala Moana Center was developed and designed by Don Graham. Critics viewed Graham&#x27;s unusual design, which oriented the mall away from the Pacific Ocean and included two levels for retail and parking, as a potential failure. However, the Ala Moana Center proved a success after its opening, and helped refocus the retail center of Oahu away from Downtown Honolulu. Graham worked as the center&#x27;s first general manager after its opening.

===Opening===
When it opened in 1959, Ala Moana Center became the largest shopping mall in the United States. Brookfield Properties of Chicago currently owns and operates Ala Moana Center. Although later retail developments across the nation have overshadowed it over the years, Brookfield markets and lists Ala Moana Center as the world&#x27;s largest open-air mall with a total retail space of . Its original tenants included Sears, Roebuck and Company, F. W. Woolworth Company, Foodland, Longs Drugs, and Shirokiya, among other local shops. Ala Moana Center&#x27;s second-phase expansion included the 1961 addition of the Ala Moana Office Building (including La Ronde, the first revolving restaurant in the United States), and the 1966 addition of JCPenney and Liberty House in a new Diamond Head wing. In 1982, Ala Moana Center was purchased by a partnership of Japanese corporation, Daiei, and an insurance company. In 1995, Daiei became the sole owner. Once a management vendor for Daiei, General Growth Properties purchased Ala Moana Center in 1999 after Daiei filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.

===Success and expansion===
The Makai Market food court was built in 1987. A 1999 expansion added the Makai wing, with Neiman Marcus as a new anchor. A shopping complex and parking spaces were demolished just north of the mall in 2006 to make way for the Mauka wing, which was completed on March 7, 2008, and was anchored by Nordstrom.

In a June 26, 2009, report from &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Ala Moana was ranked as the second most profitable mall in America based on sales per square footage, and also had one of the highest occupancy rates, at 95%. The report described the flourishing mall as a gold mine, with annual sales of more than $1 billion.

===Departure of Sears===
On February 23, 2012, Sears Holdings Corporation announced it would close its store at Ala Moana Center by early 2013. Sears held its original location and had a presence at the mall since its opening in 1959. The closing was part of a $270 million sale of 11 Sears properties nationwide. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; estimated that the Ala Moana Sears location was the largest portion of the deal, comprising between $200 million to $250 million of the overall sale price. The Ala Moana location closed permanently at 7 PM on June 2, 2013.

===Ewa Wing expansion===
On May 17, 2013, the owner of Ala Moana Center announced that Bloomingdale&#x27;s would anchor and occupy of a new and expanded Ewa wing. The expanded wing opened on November 12, 2015, replacing the existing wing on the western end of the mall, including the space previously occupied by Sears. The new wing included Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Nordstrom, which relocated from the north end of the mall, as anchors. On October 22, 2017, Target held its grand opening for its first store at a mall in Hawaii in the space formerly occupied by Nordstrom.

==Architecture and layout==

Costing US$25 million in 1959, Ala Moana Center had 87 stores and 4,000 parking spaces when it opened that year. It was remodeled extensively in various phases. New designs reflected modern Hawaiian architectural principles, emphasizing the importance of the symbolism of various natural phenomena found in Hawaii. Asian Pacific Rim motifs have been adopted reflecting the large Asian population of residents in Hawaii. For examples, for decades a centerpiece of Ala Moana Center was its koi ponds; in the Japanese culture, koi represent happiness and tranquility.

Despite these enhancements, the design of the center has been criticized for its overbuilt appearance and hodgepodge architecture, the result of years of modifications and expansions under different owners. Still, Ala Moana Center architecture and layouts inspired its owner in 2004 to invest over US$1 billion in remodeling various other shopping centers across Canada and the United States, using Ala Moana Center as a template. As of 2018, Ala Moana is valued at nearly $6 billion and is the largest outdoor mall in the world.
Ala Moana Centerstage, a stage in the center of the shopping complex, is one of the most popular public amphitheaters in Hawaii. Local talents are showcased on the stage for visitors to enjoy. Hula dances are a staple for Ala Moana Centerstage as well as performances by the Royal Hawaiian Band, the oldest municipal band in the United States. Schools throughout the world travel to Honolulu just to perform at Ala Moana Centerstage. In addition, episodes of the local TV show &quot;Hawaii Stars&quot;, a singing competition, are usually filmed on the stage; onlookers can usually be seen crowding the second- and third-story balconies overlooking the stage during taping.

<text>Mac OS X Tiger (version 10.4) is the 5th major release of macOS, Apple&#x27;s desktop and server operating system for Mac computers. Tiger was released to the public on April 29, 2005, for US$129.95 as the successor to Mac OS X 10.3 Panther. Included features were a fast searching system called Spotlight, a new version of the Safari web browser, Dashboard, a new &#x27;Unified&#x27; theme, and improved support for 64-bit addressing on Power Mac G5s. Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger also had a number of additional features that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance, such as fast file search and improved graphics processing.

Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was included with all new Macs, and was also available as an upgrade for existing Mac OS X users, or users of supported pre-Mac OS X systems. The server edition, Mac OS X Server 10.4, was also available for some Macintosh product lines. Six weeks after the official release, Apple had delivered 2 million copies of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, representing 16% of all Mac OS X users. Apple claimed that Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was the most successful Apple OS release in the company&#x27;s history. On June 11, 2007, at WWDC 2007, Apple&#x27;s CEO, Steve Jobs, announced that more than 67% of the 22 million Mac OS X users were using Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.

Apple announced a transition to Intel x86 processors during Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger&#x27;s lifetime, making it the first Apple operating system to work on Apple–Intel architecture machines. The original Apple TV, released in March 2007, shipped with a customized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger branded &quot;Apple TV OS&quot; that replaced the usual GUI with an updated version of Front Row.

Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was succeeded by Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard on October 26, 2007, after 30 months, making Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger the longest-running version of Mac OS X. The last security update released for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger users was the 2009-005 update. The latest supported version of QuickTime is 7.6.4. The latest version of iTunes that can run on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger is 9.2.1. Safari 4.1.3 is the final version for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.

Despite not having received security updates since 2009, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger remains popular with Power Mac users and retrocomputing enthusiasts due to its wide software and hardware compatibility, as it is the last Mac OS X version to support the Classic Environment – a Mac OS 9 compatibility layer – and PowerPC G3 processors.

==System requirements==
Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was initially available in a PowerPC edition, with an Intel edition released beginning at Mac OS X 10.4.4 Tiger. There is no universal version of the client operating system, although Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger Server was made available on a universal DVD from version Mac OS X 10.4.7 Tiger. While Apple shipped the PowerPC edition bundled with PowerPC-based Macs and also sold it as a separate retail box, the only way to obtain the Intel version was to buy an Intel-based Mac bundled with it. However, it was possible to buy the &#x27;restore&#x27; DVDs containing the Intel version through unofficial channels such as eBay, and officially through Apple if one could provide proof of purchase of the appropriate Intel Mac. These grey-colored &#x27;restore&#x27; DVDs supplied with new Macs, are designed to only restore on the model of Mac that they are intended for. However, they can be modified to work on any Intel Mac. The retail PowerPC-only DVD can be used on any PowerPC-based Mac supported by Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.

The system requirements of the PowerPC edition are:

*Macintosh computer with a PowerPC G3, G4 or G5 family processor
*Built-in FireWire
*DVD drive for installation
*256MB of RAM
*3GB of available hard disk space (4GB if the user installs the developer tools)

Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger removed support for older New World ROM Macs such as the original iMacs and iBooks that were supported in Mac OS X 10.3 Panther; however it is possible to install Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger on these Macs using third-party software (such as XPostFacto) that overrides the checks made at the beginning of the installation process. Likewise, machines such as beige Power Mac G3s and &#x27;Wall Street&#x27; PowerBook G3s that were dropped by Mac OS X Panther can also be made to run both Mac OS X Panther and Mac OS X Tiger in this way. Also, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger can be installed on unsupported New World ROM Macs by installing it on a supported Mac, then swapping hard drives. Old World ROM Macs require the use of XPostFacto to install Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.

Mac OS X Tiger was the last version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC G3 family of processors.

==History==
The name &quot;Mac OS X Tiger&quot; was reported by Mac Magazine on March 30, 2004; According to Mac Magazine, this information came from a safe source. Furthermore, Mac Magazine reported that the internal codename for Mac OS X Tiger had been &quot;Merlot&quot;.

Apple mentioned Mac OS X Tiger by name in a press release published on May 4, 2004, for its upcoming WWDC 2004 event.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs first presented Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger in his keynote presentation at the WWDC on June 28, 2004. In October and December 2004, several non-commercial developers&#x27; releases of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger leaked onto the internet via BitTorrent file sharers. Apple sued these file sharers. On April 12, 2005, Apple announced Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger&#x27;s official, worldwide release would be April 29. All Apple Stores around the world held Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger seminars, presentations and demos.

On June 6, 2005, at the WWDC in San Francisco, Jobs reported that nearly two million copies had been sold in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger&#x27;s first six weeks of release, making Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger the most successful operating system release in Apple&#x27;s history. Jobs then disclosed that Mac OS X had been engineered from its inception to work with Intel&#x27;s x86 line of processors in addition to the PowerPC, the CPU for which the operating system had always been publicly marketed. Apple concurrently announced its intent to release the first x86-based computers in June 2006, and to move the rest of its computers to x86 microprocessors by June 2007. On January 10, 2006, Apple presented its new iMac and MacBook Pro computers running on Intel Core Duo processors, and announced that the entire Apple product line would run on Intel processors by the end of 2006. Apple then released the Mac Pro and announced the new Xserve on August 8, completing the Intel transition in 210 days, roughly ten months ahead of the original schedule.

Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger is the first version of Mac OS X to be supplied on a DVD rather than a CD, although the DVD could originally be exchanged for CDs for $9.95.

==Reception==
John Siracusa, writing for Ars Technica, wrote that some features in Tiger were half-baked, such as filesystem metadata, Spotlight, and Dashboard. According to Siracusa, Spotlight in Tiger is confusing because it has two disparate interfaces which are kept separate, yet can accomplish the same task. Siracusa also wrote that some of Dashboard&#x27;s UI choices were strange.

==New and changed features==

===End-user features===
Apple advertised that Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger had over 150 new and improved features, including:

*Spotlight — Spotlight is a full-text and metadata search engine that can search everything on one&#x27;s Mac, including Microsoft Word documents, iCal calendars and Address Book contact cards. The feature is also used to build the concept of &#x27;smart folders&#x27; into the Finder. Spotlight will index files as they are saved, so they can be quickly and easily found through a search-as-you-type box in the menu bar. As a side-effect, it adds hidden folders and indexing files to removable media like USB flash drives.
*iChat AV — The new iChat AV 3.0 in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger supports up to four participants in a video conference and ten participants in an audio conference. It also now supports communication using the XMPP protocol. An XMPP server called iChat Server is included on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger Server.
*Safari RSS — The new Safari 2.0 web browser in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger featured a built-in reader for RSS and Atom web syndication that can be accessed easily from an RSS button in the address bar of the web browser window. An updated version of Safari, included as part of the free Mac OS X 10.4.3 Tiger update, can also pass the Acid2 web standards test.
*Mail 2 — The new version of Mail.app email client included in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger featured an updated interface, &quot;Smart Mailboxes&quot;, which utilizes the Spotlight search system, parental controls, as well as several other features.
*Automator — A scripting tool to link applications together to form complex automated workflows (written in AppleScript, Cocoa, or both). Automator came with a complete library of actions for several applications that can be used together to make a Workflow.
*VoiceOver — screen reader interface similar to Jaws for Windows and other Windows screen readers that offers the blind and visually impaired user keyboard control and spoken English descriptions of what is happening on screen. VoiceOver enables users with visual impairment to use applications via keyboard commands. VoiceOver is capable of reading aloud the contents of files including web pages, mail messages and word processing files. Complete keyboard navigation lets the user control the computer with the keyboard rather than the mouse, a menu is displayed in a window showing all the available keyboard commands that can be used.
*A complete built-in Dictionary/Thesaurus based on the New Oxford American Dictionary, Second Edition, accessible through an application, Dictionary, a Dashboard widget, and as a system-wide command (see below).
*.Mac syncing — Though this was not a new feature, .Mac syncing in Tiger is much improved over Panther. Syncing tasks in Tiger are now accomplished through the .Mac system preferences pane rather than the iSync application.
*QuickTime 7 — A new version of Apple&#x27;s multimedia software has support for the new H.264/AVC codec, which offers better quality and scalability than other video codecs. This new codec is used by iChat AV for clearer video conferencing. New classes within Cocoa provide full access to QuickTime for Cocoa application developers. The new QuickTime 7 player application bundled with Tiger now includes more advanced audio and video controls as well as a more detailed Information dialog, and the new player has been rebuilt using Apple&#x27;s Cocoa API to take advantage of the new technologies more easily.
*New Unix features — New versions of cp, mv, and rsync that support files with resource forks. Command-line support for features such as the above-mentioned Spotlight is also included.
*Xcode 2.0 — Xcode 2.0, Apple&#x27;s Cocoa development tool now includes visual modelling, an integrated Apple Reference Library and graphical remote debugging.

===New applications in Tiger===
*Dashboard — The Dashboard is a new mini-applications layer based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which returns the desk accessories concept to Mac OS. These accessories are known as widgets. It comes with several widgets such as Weather, World Clock, Unit Converter, Dictionary/Thesaurus, and others (full list). More are available to download for free online. Its similarity to the Konfabulator application caused some criticism.
*Automator — Automator uses workflows to process repetitive tasks automatically
*Grapher — Grapher is a new application capable of creating 2D and 3D graphs similar to those of Graphing Calculator.
*Dictionary — A dictionary and thesaurus program that uses the New Oxford American Dictionary. It has a fast GUI for displaying the Dictionary, and allows the user to search the dictionary with Spotlight, to print definitions, and to copy and paste text into documents. Dictionary also provides a Dictionary service in the Application menu, and Cocoa and WebKit provide a global keyboard shortcut (ctrl-⌘-D by default) for all applications that display text with them. Its use was furthered in Mac OS X Leopard by providing definitions from Wikipedia. The Dictionary application is a more feature-filled version of the Dictionary widget.
*Quartz Composer — Quartz Composer is a development tool for processing and rendering graphical data.
*AU Lab — AU Lab is a developer application for testing and mixing Audio Units.

==Improvements==
*An upgraded kernel with optimized kernel resource locking and access control lists, and with support for 64-bit userland address spaces on machines with 64-bit processors.
*An updated libSystem with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions; combined with the aforementioned kernel change, this allows individual applications to address more than 4 GB of memory when run on 64-bit processors, although an application using Apple libraries or frameworks other than libSystem would need to have two processes, one running the 64-bit code and one running the code that requires other libraries and frameworks.
*A new startup daemon called launchd that allows for faster booting.
*The printing dialog in Tiger now features a drop down menu for creating PDFs, sending PDFs to Mail, and other PDF related actions. However, the user interface was criticized for creating a hybrid UI element that looks like a plain button but acts like a pop-up menu. This is one of only three places in the entire Mac OS X interface where such an element appears.
*Dock menus now have menu items to open an application at login, or to remove the icon from the dock.
*The Window menu in the Finder now features a &quot;Cycle Through Windows&quot; menu item.
*The Get Info window for items in the Finder now includes a &quot;More Info&quot; section that includes Spotlight information tags such as Image Height &amp; Width, when the file was last opened, and where the file originated.
*Early development of resolution independence. Apple notes that this will be a user-level feature in a future version of Mac OS X. Among the changes, the maximum size of icons was increased to 256x256. However, the Finder does not yet support this size.

===Technologies===

* Core Image: A graphics processing API that allows programmers to leverage programmable GPUs for fast image processing for special effects and image correction tools. Some of the included Image Units are Blur, Color Blending, Generator Filters, Distortion Filters, Geometry Filters, and Halftone features.
* Core Data: A data persistence API that makes it easier for developers to handle structured data in their applications. Core Data provides undo, redo, and save functions for developers without them having to write any code.
* Core Video: A video graphics API that leverages Core Image to provide real-time video processing. Apple&#x27;s Motion real-time video effects program takes advantage of Core Video in Tiger. Core Video lets developers easily integrate real-time video effects and processing into their applications.
* Core Audio: Integrates a range of audio functionality directly into the operating system.

In addition to these APIs, Tiger introduces a new window theme, often described as &#x27;Unified&#x27;. A variation on the standard, non-brushed metal theme used since the introduction of Mac OS X, this theme integrates the title bar and the toolbar of a window. A prominent example of an application that utilizes this theme is Mail.

Tiger is also the first version of Mac OS X to include the &quot;Zoom&quot; screen magnifier functionality.

==Tiger trademark lawsuit==
Shortly before the release of Mac OS X Tiger, the computer retailer TigerDirect.com, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Apple, alleging that Apple infringed TigerDirect.com&#x27;s trademark with the Mac OS X Tiger operating system.

The following is a quotation from TigerDirect.com&#x27;s court memorandum:

:&quot;Apple Computer&#x27;s use of its infringing family of Tiger marks to expand sales of products besides its operating system software is already evident — for example, Apple Computer is offering free iPods and laptops as part of its Tiger World Premiere giveaway. In short, notwithstanding its representation to the PTO that it would only use Tiger in connection with their unique computer operating system software, Apple Computer has in recent weeks used a family of Tiger marks in connection with a substantially broader group of products and services, including the very products and services currently offered by Tiger Direct under its famous family of Tiger marks.&quot;

In 2005 TigerDirect was denied a preliminary injunction that would have prevented Apple from using the mark while the case was decided. Apple and TigerDirect reached a settlement in 2006, after which TigerDirect withdrew its opposition.

==Support for Intel processors==
At Apple&#x27;s 2005 Worldwide Developers Conference, CEO Steve Jobs announced that the company would begin selling Mac computers with Intel x86 processors in 2006. To allow developers to begin producing software for these Intel-based Macs, Apple made available a prototype Intel-based Mac (&quot;Developer Transition Kit&quot;) that included a version of Mac OS X v10.4.1 compiled to run on x86 processors.

This build included Apple&#x27;s Rosetta compatibility layer — a translation process that allows x86-based Macs to run software built only for PowerPC, with a moderate performance penalty. This is contrasted with the contemporary Mac OS 9 Classic mode, which used comparably larger amounts of system resources.

Soon after the Developer Transition Kits began shipping, copies of Tiger x86 were leaked onto file sharing networks. Although Apple had implemented a Trusted Computing digital rights management scheme in the transition hardware and OS in an attempt to stop people installing Tiger x86 on non-Apple PCs, the OSx86 project soon managed to remove this restriction. As Apple released each update with newer safeguards to prevent its use on non-Apple hardware, unofficially modified versions were released that circumvented Apple&#x27;s safeguards. However, with the release of 10.4.5, 10.4.6, and 10.4.7 the unofficially modified versions continued to use the kernel from 10.4.4 because later kernels have hardware locks and depend heavily on EFI. By late 2006, the 10.4.8 kernel had been cracked.

At MacWorld San Francisco 2006, Jobs announced the immediate availability of Mac OS X v10.4.4, the first publicly available release of Tiger compiled for both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based machines. This version was the first version, other than the version provided with the Developer Transition Kits, to include Rosetta.

<text>Robert Joseph Casey (1890-1962) was a decorated combat veteran and distinguished Chicago-based newspaper correspondent and columnist.

Casey was born March 14, 1890, in Beresford, South Dakota, and attended St. Mary&#x27;s College in St. Marys, Kansas from 1907 to 1911. Casey enlisted in the Army in 1918 and served at Verdun and Meuse-Argonne as an artilleryman. He earned three citations for bravery in combat before his discharge as a captain in 1919. Casey later wrote (anonymously) &quot;The Cannoneers Have Hairy Ears: A Diary of the Front Lines&quot; about his wartime experiences, and this book was acclaimed for its gritty and realistic depictions of an American soldier in World War I.

In 1920, Casey joined the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, where he worked as a columnist and foreign correspondent for twenty-seven years. Casey wrote features, chronicled the Chicago gang wars of the era, and compiled &quot;slice of life&quot; stories, which were published in the paper under column titles &quot;Vest Pocket Anthology,&quot; &quot;Such Interesting People,&quot; and &quot;More Interesting People.&quot;

During the 1920s and 1930s, Casey traveled through Indochina, Cuba, Pitcairn Islands and Easter Island, and many other sites, and wrote about his adventures in newspaper columns and books. In 1940, Casey covered the blitz in London and its aftermath; he was also in Hawaii and the Pacific right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December, 1941.

After his coverage of World War II in France, Africa, and the Pacific, Casey came back to Chicago to write. He had been married to Marie Driscoll, who died in 1945; in 1946 Casey married Hazel MacDonald, a reporter and fellow Chicago-based foreign correspondent he first met in 1933. After Casey&#x27;s retirement from the &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1947, he continued to write books and freelance newspaper articles. In 1955, he was named Press Veteran of the Year by the Chicago Press Veterans Association.

After being under treatment for several years for a heart condition and high blood pressure, Casey died of a stroke on Dec. 5, 1962 in Evanston, Illinois at the age of 72.

<doc id="641982" wikidata="Q852186" url="?curid=641982" title="Mushroom poisoning">
<text>Mushroom poisoning is poisoning resulting from the ingestion of mushrooms that contain toxic substances. Symptoms can vary from slight gastrointestinal discomfort to death in about 10 days. Mushroom toxins are secondary metabolites produced by the fungus.

Mushroom poisoning is usually the result of ingestion of wild mushrooms after misidentification of a toxic mushroom as an edible species. The most common reason for this misidentification is a close resemblance in terms of color and general morphology of the toxic mushrooms species with edible species. To prevent mushroom poisoning, mushroom gatherers familiarize themselves with the mushrooms they intend to collect, as well as with any similar-looking toxic species. The safety of eating wild mushrooms may depend on methods of preparation for cooking. Some toxins, such as amatoxins, are thermostable and mushrooms containing such toxins will not be rendered safe to eat by cooking.

==Signs and symptoms==
Poisonous mushrooms contain a variety of different toxins that can differ markedly in toxicity. Symptoms of mushroom poisoning may vary from gastric upset to organ failure resulting in death. Serious symptoms do not always occur immediately after eating, often not until the toxin attacks the kidney or liver, sometimes days or weeks later.

The most common consequence of mushroom poisoning is simply gastrointestinal upset. Most &quot;poisonous&quot; mushrooms contain gastrointestinal irritants that cause vomiting and diarrhea (sometimes requiring hospitalization), but usually no long-term damage. However, there are a number of recognized mushroom toxins with specific, and sometimes deadly, effects:

The period between ingestion and the onset of symptoms varies dramatically between toxins, some taking days to show symptoms identifiable as mushroom poisoning.
* α-Amanitin: For 6–12 hours, there are no symptoms. This is followed by a period of gastrointestinal upset (vomiting and profuse, watery diarrhea). This stage is caused primarily by the phallotoxins and typically lasts 24 hours. At the end of this second stage is when severe liver damage begins. The damage may continue for another 2–3 days. Kidney damage can also occur. Some patients will require a liver transplant. Amatoxins are found in some mushrooms in the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;, but are also found in some species of &quot;Galerina&quot; and &quot;Lepiota&quot;. Overall, mortality is between 10 and 15 percent. Recently, &quot;Silybum marianum&quot; or blessed milk thistle has been shown to protect the liver from amanita toxins and promote regrowth of damaged cells.
* Orellanine: This toxin generally causes no symptoms for 3–20 days after ingestion. Typically around day 11, the process of kidney failure begins, and is usually symptomatic by day 20. These symptoms can include pain in the area of the kidneys, thirst, vomiting, headache, and fatigue. A few species in the very large genus &quot;Cortinarius&quot; contain this toxin. People having eaten mushrooms containing orellanine may experience early symptoms as well, because the mushrooms often contain other toxins in addition to orellanine. A related toxin that causes similar symptoms but within 3–6 days has been isolated from &quot;Amanita smithiana&quot; and some other related toxic &quot;Amanita&quot;s.
* Muscarine: Muscarine stimulates the muscarinic receptors of the nerves and muscles. Symptoms include sweating, salivation, tears, blurred vision, palpitations, and, in high doses, respiratory failure. Muscarine is found in mushrooms of the genus &quot;Omphalotus&quot;, notably the jack o&#x27; Lantern mushrooms. It is also found in &quot;A. muscaria&quot;, although it is now known that the main effect of this mushroom is caused by ibotenic acid. Muscarine can also be found in some &quot;Inocybe&quot; species and &quot;Clitocybe&quot; species, in particular &quot;Clitocybe dealbata&quot;, and some red-pored &quot;Boletes.&quot;
* Gyromitrin: Stomach acids convert gyromitrin to monomethylhydrazine (MMH). It affects multiple body systems. It blocks the important neurotransmitter GABA, leading to stupor, delirium, muscle cramps, loss of coordination, tremors, and/or seizures. It causes severe gastrointestinal irritation, leading to vomiting and diarrhea. In some cases, liver failure has been reported. It can also cause red blood cells to break down, leading to jaundice, kidney failure, and signs of anemia. It is found in mushrooms of the genus &quot;Gyromitra&quot;. A gyromitrin-like compound has also been identified in mushrooms of the genus &quot;Verpa&quot;.
* Coprine: Coprine is metabolized to a chemical that resembles disulfiram. It inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which, in general, causes no harm, unless the person has alcohol in their bloodstream while ALDH is inhibited. This can happen if alcohol is ingested shortly before or up to a few days after eating the mushrooms. In that case, the alcohol cannot be completely metabolized, and the person will experience flushed skin, vomiting, headache, dizziness, weakness, apprehension, confusion, palpitations, and sometimes trouble to breathe. Coprine is found mainly in mushrooms of the genus &quot;Coprinus&quot;, although similar effects have been noted after ingestion of &quot;Clitocybe clavipes&quot;.
* Ibotenic acid: Decarboxylates into muscimol upon ingestion. The effects of muscimol vary, but nausea and vomiting are common. Confusion, euphoria, or sleepiness are possible. Loss of muscular coordination, sweating, and chills are likely. Some people experience visual distortions, a feeling of strength, or delusions. Symptoms normally appear after 30 minutes to 2 hours and last for several hours. &quot;A. muscaria&quot;, the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; mushroom, is known for the hallucinatory experiences caused by muscimol, but &quot;A. pantherina&quot; and &quot;A. gemmata&quot; also contain the same compound. While normally self-limiting, fatalities have been associated with &quot;A. pantherina&quot;, and consumption of a large number of any of these mushrooms is likely to be dangerous.
* Arabitol: A sugar alcohol, similar to mannitol, which causes no harm in most people but causes gastrointestinal irritation in some. It is found in small amounts in oyster mushrooms, and considerable amounts in &quot;Suillus&quot; species and &quot;Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca&quot; (the &quot;false chanterelle&quot;).

==Causes==
 
New species of fungi are continuing to be discovered, with an estimated number of 800 new species registered annually. This, added to the fact that many investigations have recently reclassified some species of mushrooms from edible to poisonous has made older classifications insufficient at describing what now is known about the different species of fungi that are harmful to humans. It is now thought that of the approximately 100,000 known fungi species found worldwide, about 100 of them are poisonous to humans. However, by far the majority of mushroom poisonings are not fatal, and the majority of fatal poisonings are attributable to the &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot; mushroom.

A majority of these cases are due to mistaken identity. This is a common occurrence with &quot;A. phalloides&quot; in particular, due to its resemblance to the Asian paddy-straw mushroom, &quot;Volvariella volvacea&quot;. Both are light-colored and covered with a universal veil when young.

&quot;Amanitas&quot; can be mistaken for other species, as well, in particular when immature. On at least one occasion they have been mistaken for &quot;Coprinus comatus&quot;. In this case, the victim had some limited experience in identifying mushrooms, but did not take the time to correctly identify these particular mushrooms until after he began to experience symptoms of mushroom poisoning.

The author of &quot;Mushrooms Demystified&quot;, David Arora cautions puffball-hunters to beware of &quot;Amanita&quot; &quot;eggs&quot;, which are &quot;Amanita&quot;s still entirely encased in their universal veil. &quot;Amanita&quot;s at this stage are difficult to distinguish from puffballs. Foragers are encouraged to always cut the fruiting bodies of suspected puffballs in half, as this will reveal the outline of a developing &quot;Amanita&quot; should it be present within the structure.

A majority of mushroom poisonings, in general, are the result of small children, especially toddlers in the &quot;grazing&quot; stage, ingesting mushrooms found on the lawn. While this can happen with any mushroom, &quot;Chlorophyllum molybdites&quot; is often implicated due to its preference for growing in lawns. &quot;C. molybdites&quot; causes severe gastrointestinal upset but is not considered deadly poisonous.

A few poisonings are the result of misidentification while attempting to collect hallucinogenic mushrooms for recreational use. In 1981, one fatality and two hospitalizations occurred following consumption of &quot;Galerina marginata&quot;, mistaken for a &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species. &quot;Galerina&quot; and &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species are both small, brown, and sticky, and can be found growing together. However, &quot;Galerina&quot; contains amatoxins, the same poison found in the deadly &quot;Amanita&quot; species. Another case reports kidney failure following ingestion of &quot;Cortinarius orellanus&quot;, a mushroom containing orellanine.

It is natural that accidental ingestion of hallucinogenic species also occurs, but is rarely harmful when ingested in small quantities. Cases of serious toxicity have been reported in small children. &quot;Amanita pantherina&quot;, while containing the same hallucinogens as &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (e.g., ibotenic acid and muscimol), has been more commonly associated with severe gastrointestinal upset than its better-known counterpart.

Although usually not fatal, &quot;Omphalotus&quot; spp., &quot;Jack-o-lantern mushrooms&quot;, are another cause of sometimes significant toxicity. They are sometimes mistaken for chanterelles. Both are bright-orange and fruit at the same time of year, although &quot;Omphalotus&quot; grows on wood and has true gills rather than the veins of a &quot;Cantharellus&quot;. They contain toxins known as illudins, which causes gastrointestinal symptoms.

Bioluminescent species are generally inedible and often mildly toxic.

&quot;Clitocybe dealbata&quot;, which is occasionally mistaken for an oyster mushroom or other edible species contains muscarine.

Toxicities can also occur with collection of morels. Even true morels, if eaten raw, will cause gastrointestinal upset. Typically, morels are thoroughly cooked before eating. &quot;Verpa bohemica&quot;, although referred to as &quot;thimble morels&quot; or &quot;early morels&quot; by some, have caused toxic effects in some individuals. &quot;Gyromitra&quot; spp., &quot;false morels&quot;, are deadly poisonous if eaten raw. They contain a toxin called gyromitrin, which can cause neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and destruction of the blood cells. The Finns consume &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; after parboiling, but this may not render the mushroom entirely safe, resulting in its being called the &quot;fugu of the Finnish cuisine&quot;.

A more unusual toxin is coprine, a disulfiram-like compound that is harmless unless ingested within a few days of ingesting alcohol. It inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme required for breaking down alcohol. Thus, the symptoms of toxicity are similar to being hung over—flushing, headache, nausea, palpitations, and, in severe cases, trouble breathing. &quot;Coprinus&quot; species, including &quot;Coprinopsis atramentaria&quot;, contain coprine. &quot;Coprinus comatus&quot; does not, but it is best to avoid mixing alcohol with other members of this genus.

Recently, poisonings have also been associated with &quot;Amanita smithiana&quot;. These poisonings may be due to orellanine, but the onset of symptoms occurs in 4 to 11 hours, which is much quicker than the 3 to 20 days normally associated with orellanine.

&quot;Paxillus involutus&quot; is also inedible when raw, but is eaten in Europe after pickling or parboiling. However, after the death of the German mycologist Dr. Julius Schäffer, it was discovered that the mushroom contains a toxin that can stimulate the immune system to attack its red blood cells. This reaction is rare but can occur even after safely eating the mushroom for many years. Similarly, &quot;Tricholoma equestre&quot; was widely considered edible and good, until it was connected with rare cases of rhabdomyolysis.

In the fall of 2004, thirteen deaths were associated with consumption of &quot;Pleurocybella porrigens&quot; or &quot;angel&#x27;s wings&quot;. In general, these mushrooms are considered edible. All the victims died of an acute brain disorder, and all had pre-existing kidney disease. The exact cause of the toxicity was not known at this time and the deaths cannot be definitively attributed to mushroom consumption.

However, mushroom poisoning is not always due to mistaken identity. For example, the highly toxic ergot &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot;, which grows on rye, is sometimes ground up with rye, unnoticed, and later consumed. This can cause devastating, even fatal, effects, called ergotism.

Cases of idiosyncratic or unusual reactions to fungi can also occur. Some are probably due to allergy, others to some other kind of sensitivity. It is not uncommon for a person to experience gastrointestinal upset associated with one particular mushroom species or genus.

Some mushrooms might concentrate toxins from their growth substrate, such as Chicken of the Woods growing on yew trees.

===Poisonous mushrooms===
Of the most lethal mushrooms, five—the death cap (&quot;A. phalloides&quot;), the three destroying angels (&quot;A. virosa&quot;, &quot;A. bisporigera&quot;, and &quot;A. ocreata&quot;), and the fool&#x27;s mushroom (&quot;A. verna&quot;)—belong to the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;, and two more—the deadly webcap (&quot;C. rubellus&quot;), and the fool&#x27;s webcap (&quot;C. orellanus&quot;)—are from the genus &quot;Cortinarius&quot;. Several species of Galerina, Lepiota, and Conocybe also contain lethal amounts of amatoxins. Deadly species are listed in the List of deadly fungi.

The following species may cause great discomfort, sometimes requiring hospitalization, but are not considered deadly.
* &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (fly agaric) – Contains the psychoactive muscimol and the neurotoxin ibotenic acid. Ibotenic acid decarboxylates into muscimol upon curing of the mushroom, rendering it relatively non-toxic, though death via respiratory depression is possible. Muscimol intoxication is often considered unpleasant and undesirable, however, and as such has seen little recreational use compared to the unrelated psilocybin mushroom, though it has been used as an entheogen by the native people of Siberia.
* &quot;Amanita pantherina&quot; (panther mushroom) – contains similar toxins as &quot;A. muscaria&quot;, but is associated with more fatalities than &quot;A. muscaria&quot;.
* &quot;Chlorophyllum molybdites&quot; (greengills) – causes intense gastrointestinal upset.
* &quot;Entoloma&quot; (pinkgills) – some species are highly poisonous, such as livid entoloma (&quot;Entoloma sinuatum&quot;), &quot;Entoloma rhodopolium&quot;, and &quot;Entoloma nidorosum&quot;. Symptoms of intense gastrointestinal upset appear after 20 minutes to 4 hours, caused by an unidentified gastrointestinal irritant.
* Many &quot;Inocybe&quot; species such as &quot;Inocybe fastigiata&quot; and &quot;Inocybe geophylla&quot; contain muscarine.
* &quot;Inosperma erubescens&quot; has caused death.
* Some white &quot;Clitocybe&quot; species, including &quot;C. rivulosa&quot; and &quot;C. dealbata&quot;, contain muscarine.
* &quot;Tricholoma pardinum&quot;, &quot;Tricholoma tigrinum&quot; (tiger tricholoma) – gastrointestinal upset due to an unidentified toxin, begins in 15 minutes to 2 hours and lasts 4 to 6 days.
* &quot;Tricholoma equestre&quot; (man-on-horseback) – until recently thought edible and good, can lead to rhabdomyolysis after repeated consumption.
* &quot;Hypholoma fasciculare&quot;/&quot;Naematoloma fasciculare&quot; (sulfur tuft) – usually causes gastrointestinal upset, but the toxins fasciculol E and F could lead to paralysis and death.
* &quot;Paxillus involutus&quot; (brown roll-rim) – once thought edible, but now found to destroy red blood cells with regular or long-term consumption.
* &quot;Rubroboletus satanas&quot; (Devil&#x27;s bolete), &quot;Suillellus luridus&quot;, &quot;Rubroboletus legaliae&quot;, &quot;Chalciporus piperatus&quot;, &quot;Neoboletus luridiformis&quot;, &quot;Rubroboletus pulcherrimus&quot; – gastrointestinal irritation. Of these, only &quot;R. pulcherrimus&quot; has been implicated in a death. Many books list &quot;N. luridiformis&quot; as edible, but Arora lists it as &quot;to be avoided&quot;.
* &quot;Hebeloma crustuliniforme&quot; (known as poison pie or fairy cakes) – causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
* &quot;Russula emetica&quot; (the sickener) – as its name implies, causes rapid vomiting. Other Russulas with a peppery taste (&quot;Russula silvicola&quot;, &quot;Russula mairei&quot;) will likely do the same.
* &quot;Agaricus hondensis&quot;, &quot;Agaricus californicus&quot;, &quot;Agaricus praeclaresquamosus&quot;, &quot;Agaricus xanthodermus&quot; – cause vomiting and diarrhea in most people, although some people seem to be immune.
* &quot;Lactifluus piperatus&quot;, &quot;Lactarius torminosus&quot;, &quot;Lactarius rufus&quot; – these and other peppery-tasting milk-caps are pickled and eaten in Scandinavia, but are indigestible or poisonous unless correctly prepared.
* &quot;Lactarius vinaceorufescens&quot;, &quot;Lactarius uvidus&quot; – reported to be poisonous. Arora reports that all yellow- or purple-staining &quot;Lactarius&quot; are &quot;best avoided&quot;.
* &quot;Ramaria gelatinosa&quot; – causes indigestion in many people, although some seem immune.
* &quot;Gomphus floccosus&quot; (the scaly chanterelle) – causes gastric upset in many people, although some eat it without problems. &quot;G. floccosus&quot; is sometimes confused with the chanterelle.

== Evolution ==
Many different species of mushrooms are poisonous and contain differing toxins that cause different types of harm. The most common toxin that causes severe poisoning is amatoxin, found in various mushroom species that cause the most fatalities every year. Amanita, or “ the death cap”, is a type of mushroom named for its substantial amount of amatoxin, which has about 10 mg per mushroom, which is the lethal dose. Amatoxin blocks the replication of DNA, which leads to cell death. This can affect cells that replicate frequently, such as kidneys, livers, and eventually, the central nervous system. It can also cause the loss of muscle contraction and liver failure. Despite the severe and dangerous symptoms, amatoxin poisoning is treatable given quick, professional care. 

Mushrooms have also been found to have evolved toxicity independently from each other. Researchers have found that different mushroom species share the same type of amatoxin called amanitin. They specifically looked at three of the deadliest species, Amanita, Galerina, and Lepiota. Through genome sequencing, a scientific process that determines the DNA sequence of an organism’s genome, closely related mushrooms obtained genetic information via horizontal gene transfer. Once assimilated, it can then be passed down to an offspring. The researchers also concluded that there is “an unknown ancestral fungal donor,” that allowed for horizontal gene transfer.

Mushroom toxins have appeared and disappeared many times throughout their evolutionary history. Many scientists believe that the toxins evolved in mushrooms are used to deter predation, either from fungivores or mammals. If mushrooms are consumed, it can negatively affect their ability to disperse spores, survive, and reproduce. Snails and insects are fungivores and many have learned or evolved to avoid eating poisonous mushrooms. However, it is believed that mammals pose a higher threat to mushrooms than fungivores, as larger body sizes mean they are more capable of eating an entire fungus in one sitting.

Some phenotypes, or observable characteristics, may co-occur with toxicity, and therefore act as a warning signal. The first potential warning sign is aposematism, which is an adaptation that warns off predators based on a physical trait of an organism. In this case, the researchers were interested in observing whether the color of a mushroom deters predators. This would suggest that toxic mushrooms are of different colors than non-poisonous ones. The visual cue of some colors should be enough for predators to know not to consume the mushroom. The second possible warning sign is olfactory aposematism, a similar concept, but instead of focusing on color, the odor of the mushroom would be what deters predation. This would again indicate that poisonous mushrooms would emit a different odor than non-poisonous ones. Alternatively, is the ability of organisms to learn from other organisms. This would suggest that avoidance of toxic mushrooms is a learned behavior. Organisms may avoid toxic mushrooms if they observed other organisms of the same species consume the fungus. Learned behavior is when an organism learns how to behave based on previous experiences. Some researchers believe that if an organism got sick or observed another organism get sick from consuming a poisonous mushroom, then they would know not to continue consuming it for fear of getting sick again.

An analysis of 245 North American mushroom species and 265 from Europe, revealed 21.2% of the North American species and 12.1% of the European ones as poisonous. After collecting this information, and using a neural network to classify all of the mushrooms based on color and odor, the researchers concluded that there was no correlation between cap color and mushrooms containing toxins. The cap is the top, rounded part of a mushroom and comes in different colors. This proposes that the cap color does not act as a warning sign to deter predators, providing no evidence that poisonous mushrooms may not signal their toxicity through visual or chemical traits. The three deadly mushrooms listed above, Amanita, Galerina, and Lepiota, are all of different colors, consisting of reds, yellows, browns, and whites. A possible theory as to why color is not a factor in determining whether a mushroom is poisonous is the fact that many of its predators are nocturnal and have poor vision. Therefore, viewing the different colors is difficult, and could result in inaccurate consumption. The study, however, did suggest that poisonous mushrooms do emit a smell that is unpleasant and therefore discourages consumption. Despite this result, there is no definitive evidence to suggest if the odor is a result of the production of the toxin or if it is intended as a warning signal. Additionally, many of the odors are not picked up by humans. This could suggest that there is another characteristic difference between poisonous and non-poisonous mushrooms to avoid predation from larger mammals or that there is another purpose for some mushrooms being poisonous that is not dependent on predators.

== Prognosis and treatment ==
Some mushrooms contain less toxic compounds and, therefore, are not severely poisonous. Poisonings by these mushrooms may respond well to treatment. However, certain types of mushrooms contain very potent toxins and are very poisonous; so even if symptoms are treated promptly, mortality is high. With some toxins, death can occur in a week or a few days. Although a liver or kidney transplant may save some patients with complete organ failure, in many cases there are no organs available. Patients hospitalized and given aggressive support therapy almost immediately after ingestion of amanitin-containing mushrooms have a mortality rate of only 10%, whereas those admitted 60 or more hours after ingestion have a 50–90% mortality rate. In the United States, mushroom poisoning kills an average of about 3 people a year. According to National Poison Data System (NPDS) annual reports published by America&#x27;s Poison Centers, the average number of deaths occurring over a ten-year period (2012–2020) sits right at 3 a year. In 2012, 4 out of the 7 total deaths that occurred that year, were attributed to a single event where a &quot;housekeeper at a Board and Care Home for elderly dementia patients collected and cooked wild (Amanita) mushrooms into a sauce that she consumed with six residents of the home.&quot;. Over 1,300 emergency room visits in the United States were attributed to poisonous mushroom ingestion in 2016, with about 9% of patients experiencing a serious adverse outcome.

==Society and culture==

===Folklore===
Many old wives&#x27; tales concern the defining features of poisonous mushrooms. However, there are no general identifiers for poisonous mushrooms, so such beliefs are unreliable. Guidelines to identify particular mushrooms exist, and will serve only if one knows which mushrooms are toxic.

Examples of erroneous folklore &quot;rules&quot; include:
* &quot;Poisonous mushrooms are brightly colored.&quot; – Indeed, fly agaric, usually bright-red to orange or yellow, is narcotic and hallucinogenic, although no human deaths have been reported. The deadly destroying angel, in contrast, is an unremarkable white. The deadly &quot;Galerinas&quot; are brown. Some choice edible species (chanterelles, &quot;Amanita caesarea&quot;, &quot;Laetiporus sulphureus&quot;, etc.) are brightly colored, whereas most poisonous species are brown or white.
* &quot;Insects/animals will avoid toxic mushrooms.&quot; – Fungi that are harmless to invertebrates can still be toxic to humans; the death cap, for instance, is often infested by insect larvae.
* &quot;Poisonous mushrooms blacken silver.&quot; – None of the known mushroom toxins react with silver.
* &quot;Poisonous mushrooms taste bad.&quot; – People who have eaten the deadly &quot;Amanitas&quot; and survived have reported that the mushrooms tasted quite good.
* &quot;All mushrooms are safe if cooked/parboiled/dried/pickled/etc.&quot; – While it is true that some otherwise-inedible species can be rendered safe by special preparation, many toxic species cannot be made toxin-free. Many fungal toxins are not particularly sensitive to heat and so are not broken down during cooking; in particular, α-Amanitin, the poison produced by the death cap (&quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;) and others of the genus, is not denatured by heat.
* &quot;Poisonous mushrooms will turn rice red when boiled.&quot; – A number of Laotian refugees were hospitalized after eating mushrooms (probably toxic &quot;Russula&quot; species) deemed safe by this folklore rule and this misconception cost at least one person her life.
* &quot;Poisonous mushrooms have a pointed cap. Edible ones have a flat, rounded cap.&quot; – The shape of the mushroom cap does not correlate with presence or absence of mushroom toxins, so this is not a reliable method to distinguish between edible and poisonous species. Death cap, for instance, has a rounded cap when mature.
* &quot;Boletes are, in general, safe to eat.&quot; – It is true that, unlike a number of &quot;Amanita&quot; species in particular, in most parts of the world, there are no known deadly varieties of the genus &quot;Boletus&quot;, which reduces the risks associated with misidentification. However, mushrooms like the Devil&#x27;s bolete are poisonous both raw and cooked and can lead to strong gastrointestinal symptoms, and other species like the lurid bolete require thorough cooking to break down toxins. As with another mushroom &quot;genera&quot;, proper caution is, therefore, advised in determining the correct species.

===Notable cases===
* Siddhartha Gautama (known as The Buddha), by some accounts, may have died of mushroom poisoning around ~479 BCE, though this claim has not been universally accepted.
* Roman Emperor Claudius is said to have been murdered by being fed the death cap mushroom. However, this story first appeared some two centuries after the events, and it is debatable whether Claudius was murdered at all.
* The best-selling author Nicholas Evans (&quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;) was poisoned (but survived) after eating &quot;Cortinarius rubellus&quot;.
* The parents of the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, who created the Fahrenheit temperature scale, died in Danzig on 14 August 1701 from accidentally eating poisonous mushrooms.
* The composer Johann Schobert died in Paris, along with his wife, all but one of his children, their maidservant, and four acquaintances after insisting that certain poisonous mushrooms they had gathered were edible despite the express warning of cooks at two separate restaurants to which he had taken the mushrooms.
* July 2023 Leongatha mushroom poisoning − Four people in Leongatha, Australia were taken to hospital after consuming beef Wellington suspected to have contained death cap mushrooms. Three of the four guests subsequently died and one survived, later receiving a liver transplant. The woman who cooked the meal, Erin Patterson, was charged with murder in November 2023. Patterson has pleaded not guilty and the Supreme court is expected to hear her case on 28 April, 2025.
* In August 2023, Professor Vitaly Melnikov, 77, who had headed the Moscow Department of Rocket and Space Systems at RSC Energia (Russia&#x27;s leading spacecraft manufacturer), became suddenly seriously ill and subsequently died after eating inedible mushrooms.

<text>Ignacy Mościcki (; 1 December 1867 – 2 October 1946) was a Polish chemist and politician who was the country&#x27;s president from 1926 to 1939. He was the longest serving president in Polish history. Mościcki was the President of Poland when Germany invaded the country on and started World War II.

==Early life and career==
Mościcki was born on 1 December 1867 in Mierzanowo, a small village near Ciechanów, Congress Poland. After completing school in Warsaw, he studied chemistry at the Riga Polytechnicum, where he joined the Polish underground leftist organization, &quot;Proletariat&quot;.

Upon graduating, he returned to Warsaw but was threatened by the Tsarist secret police with life imprisonment in Siberia and was forced to emigrate in 1892 to London. In 1896, he was offered an assistantship at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. There, he patented a method for cheap industrial production of nitric acid.

In 1912, Mościcki moved to Lviv (), in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, in Austria-Hungary, where he accepted a chair in physical chemistry and technical electrochemistry at the Lviv Polytechnic. In 1925, he was elected rector of the Lwów Polytechnic (as it was then called), but soon moved to Warsaw to continue his research at the Warsaw Polytechnic. In 1926, he became an Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society.

==Presidency==

After Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s May 1926 coup d&#x27;état on 1 June 1926, Mościcki, once an associate of Piłsudski in the Polish Socialist Party, was elected President of Poland by the National Assembly on the recommendation of Piłsudski, who had refused the post for himself.

As president, Mościcki was subservient to Piłsudski and never openly showed dissent from any aspect of the Marshal&#x27;s leadership. After Piłsudski&#x27;s death in 1935, his followers divided into three main factions: those supporting Mościcki as Piłsudski&#x27;s successor, those supporting General Edward Rydz-Śmigły and those supporting Prime Minister Walery Sławek.

With a view to eliminating Sławek from the game, Mościcki concluded a power-sharing agreement with Rydz-Śmigły, which had caused Sławek to be marginalised as a serious political player by the end of the year. As a result of the agreement, Rydz-Śmigły would become the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Poland until the outbreak of the war, and Mościcki remained influential by continuing in office as president.

Mościcki was the leading moderate figure in the regime, which was referred to as the &quot;colonels&#x27; government&quot; because of the major presence of military officers in the Polish government. Mościcki opposed many of the nationalist excesses of the more right-wing Rydz-Śmigły, but their pact remained more or less intact.

Mościcki remained president until September 1939, when he was interned in Romania after the German invasion of Poland and was forced by France to resign his office. He transferred the office to General Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski, who held it for only one day before General Władysław Sikorski and the French government ousted him in favour of Władysław Raczkiewicz.
==Later life==
Mościcki was planning to leave for Switzerland after leaving office as president. From 1908 to 1920, he was a citizen of Switzerland; he was also an honorary citizen of Fribourg. The Romanian authorities gave their provisional consent to his departure, but Germany opposed it. Mościcki was offered to United States President Franklin Roosevelt, who was determined to have Mościcki go to Switzerland. The intervention of the US government forced the Romanian authorities to agree. General Sikorski also ordered the Polish embassy in Bucharest to provide all assistance to Mościcki. The president stayed in Romania until December 1939.

Mościcki came to Switzerland through Milan, where he met with Wieniawa-Długoszowski. Initially, he lived in Fribourg, where he was allowed to continue his scientific work. During this period, among others, he wrote down his memories, which were published by the New York City magazine &quot;Independence&quot;. Mościcki donated money to soldiers of the Polish Army in France, Warsaw residents in prisoner-of-war camps, concentration camps and labour camps. For five months, he taught at the University of Fribourg. Later, he was forced to take up paid work. In 1940, he moved to Geneva, where he worked in the Hydro-Nitro Chemical Laboratory.

Mościcki&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly after 1943. He died on 2 October 1946, in Versoix, near Geneva, and was buried at the cemetery of the town. His daughter Helena (1897-1962) and her second husband Aleksander Bobkowski (1885-1966) were buried next to him.

==Legacy==

In 1984, his descendants requested for the remains of Mościcki and his wife to be moved from Switzerland to Poland. The relevant Polish authorities agreed that a funeral was to be held in Warsaw and be completely private, without any state ceremonies. However, the authorities of the Canton of Geneva in Switzerland withdrew their agreement for political reasons after protests related to Solidarity from emigrants. 
On 10 September 1993, Mościcki&#x27;s remains were exhumed from the cemetery of Versoix and transported to Poland. Three days later they were deposited on behalf of incumbent President Lech Wałęsa in the crypt of St. John&#x27;s Archcathedral, Warsaw. Mościcki&#x27;s symbolic grave is located in the Avenue of Merit at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw, where his second wife is buried next to him. 

The mortal remains of his daughter Helena and her husband Aleksander Bobkowski were also moved in September 1993 to the Mościcki family tomb at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw
