<text>Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov (born 5 October 1976) is a Russian politician and current Head of the Chechen Republic. He was formerly affiliated with the Chechen independence movement, through his father who was the separatist-appointed mufti of Chechnya. He is a colonel general in the Russian military.

Kadyrov is the son of former Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov, who switched sides in the Second Chechen War by offering his service to Vladimir Putin&#x27;s administration in Russia and became Chechen president in 2003. Akhmad Kadyrov was assassinated in May 2004. In February 2007, Ramzan Kadyrov replaced Alu Alkhanov as president, shortly after he had turned 30, which is the minimum age for the post. He was engaged in violent power struggles with Chechen commanders Sulim Yamadayev (d. 2009) and Said-Magomed Kakiyev for overall military authority, and with Alkhanov for political authority. Since November 2015, he has been a member of the Advisory Commission of the State Council of the Russian Federation.

Kadyrov frequently employs totalitarian and repressive tactics in his rule of the Chechen Republic. Over the years, he has come under criticism from international organizations for a wide array of human rights abuses under his government, with Human Rights Watch calling the forced disappearances and torture so widespread that they constituted crimes against humanity. During his tenure, he has advocated restricting the public lives of women, and led anti-gay purges in the Republic. Kadyrov has been frequently accused of involvement in the kidnapping, assassination, and torture of human rights activists, critics, and their relatives, within both Chechnya and other regions of the Russian Federation, as well as abroad, through the political use of police and military forces. He publicly denies these accusations.

Kadyrov has attempted to portray a hypermasculine image in public, frequently posing with guns and military garb or displaying his wealth and opulence. The Kadyrov family has enriched itself considerably during its rule of the Chechen Republic; the Russian Federation dispenses extensive funding to the Chechen government, while the distinction between the Chechen government and Kadyrov is blurry.

==Early life==

Kadyrov was born in Tsentaroy, in the Checheno-Ingush ASSR, in the Russian SFSR, part of the Soviet Union. He was the second son in Akhmad and Aimani Kadyrov&#x27;s family and their youngest child. He had an elder brother named Zelimkhan (1974–31 May 2004), and he has two elder sisters, Zargan (born 1971) and Zulay (born 1972).

The Q&#x27;adarġeran neqe, correspondent to the Kadyrov family in Chechen kinship, belongs to the Benoy teip. Although the Benoy were among the wealthiest of the Chechen teips, their prolonged resistance to annexation by the Russian Empire was met with forced resettlement during the last years of the Caucasian War.

Kadyrov strove to gain the respect of his father, Akhmad Kadyrov, who was an imam. He claims that he always emulated his father. In the early 1990s, as the Soviet Union dissolved, the Chechens launched a bid for independence. Akhmad had supported the call for jihad against Russians during the First Chechen War but switched sides and declared allegiance to Russia in the Second Chechen War.

During the First Chechen War, together with his father, Ramzan Kadyrov fought against Russian armed forces. After the war, Ramzan was the personal driver and bodyguard of his father Akhmad, who became the separatist mufti of Chechnya. The Kadyrovite militia was formed during the First Chechen War, when Akhmad Kadyrov declared jihad against Russia. The family defected to the Russian side at the beginning of the Second Chechen War in 1999. Since then, Kadyrov led his militia with support from Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service (FSB), including the provision of service ID cards, becoming the head of the Chechen Presidential Security Service. The militia later became known as the Kadyrovites.

=== Nickname ===
In Chechen society, Kadyrov is widely known under the nickname &quot;Lyulya&quot;. There are claims that this is Kadyrov&#x27;s childhood nickname.

==Political career==
===Deputy Prime Minister===

After his father, the then President, was assassinated on 9 May 2004, Ramzan was appointed as the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic on 10 May 2004.

When his sister was detained by the Dagestan police in January 2005, Kadyrov and some 150 armed men drove to the Khasavyurt City Police (GOVD) building. According to the city mayor, Kadyrov&#x27;s men surrounded the GOVD, forcing its duty officers against a wall, and assaulted them, after which they left the building with Zulay Kadyrova, &quot;victoriously shooting in the air.&quot;

In August 2005, Kadyrov declared that &quot;Europe&#x27;s largest mosque&quot; would be built in place of the demolished ruins of Grozny&#x27;s shattered downtown. He also claimed that Chechnya is the &quot;most peaceful place in Russia&quot; and in a few years it would also be &quot;the wealthiest and the most peaceful&quot; place in the world. He said that the war was already over with only 150 &quot;bandits&quot; remaining (as opposed to the official figures of 700 to 2,000 rebel fighters), and that thanks to his father, 7,000 separatists had already defected to the Russian side since 1999. When responding to a question on how he is going to &quot;avenge the murder of his father&quot;, Kadyrov said:
He remained the First Deputy Prime Minister until November 2005.

===Acting Prime Minister===

Following a car accident in November 2005, in which Chechnya&#x27;s prime minister Sergey Abramov was injured, Kadyrov was appointed as the caretaker prime minister on 18 November 2005. He immediately proceeded to implement elements of Sharia law, such as declaring a ban on gambling and alcohol production.

In February 2006, responding to the publication of the Mohammed cartoons, he accused the Danes of &quot;spying&quot; and being &quot;pro-terrorist&quot;. He also banned Danish citizens from entering Chechnya, effectively banning activity of the Danish Refugee Council, the largest non-governmental organisation working in the region. Kadyrov is quoted as saying, &quot;That cartoonist needs to be buried alive.&quot; He was eventually pressed to overturn this decision by Moscow, a rare example of federal intervention in Kadyrov&#x27;s rule in the republic.

===Prime minister===
On 1 March 2006, Sergey Abramov resigned from the position of prime minister and told Itar-Tass news agency that he did so &quot;on the condition that Ramzan Kadyrov lead the Chechen government.&quot; This was followed by a decree of Kadyrov forcing women to wear headscarves; he also rejected a federal appropriation of the republic&#x27;s budget, demanding more money, and called for all federal forces but the border guards to be withdrawn.

Kadyrov was appointed as the Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic by Alkhanov on 4 March 2006. Shortly after taking office, Kadyrov approved a project to erect a presidential palace on a plot by the Sunzha River in ruined downtown Grozny. The project, which was also to include a five-star hotel and recreational facilities, was estimated to cost around 1.5 billion roubles ($54 million USD) to build.

Later, Kadyrov called for refugee camps scattered across Chechnya to be closed down, calling the refugees &quot;international spies who are interested in stoking conflict between Chechnya and Russia, who are seeking to destabilise the situation in our region&quot;. Reuters quoted him as saying that &quot;liquidating the refugee camps will allow us to uncover spies who are working for foreign intelligence services&quot;. His cousin Odes Baysultanov was appointed to the position of First Deputy Prime Minister by Alkhanov on 6 March 2006 after being unanimously approved by the Chechen Parliament.

On 5 June 2006, Speaker of the Chechen People&#x27;s Assembly Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov said at a press conference in Moscow that &quot;there is no alternative&quot; to Kadyrov for the presidency; Kadyrov has &quot;exclusive awards in combat, and has made achievements in improving the peaceful life and in human rights protection. Who could replace him at this stage? Nobody,&quot; he said. Later that year, Umar Dzhabrailov, Chechnya&#x27;s representative in the Federation Council and a close ally of Kadyrov&#x27;s, urged Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov to initiate a measure calling on Kadyrov to become the republic&#x27;s president, thereby replacing Alu Alkhanov.

The following week, several Russian newspapers reported that a worsening security situation in Chechnya was lessening the likelihood that Kadyrov would replace Alu Alkhanov as the republic&#x27;s president. Other media, however, reported that Kadyrov continued to strengthen his position at Alkhanov&#x27;s expense. He was also elected as the Chair of the Chechen Peoples&#x27; Assembly in late-October 2006.

On 6 December 2006, Kadyrov said that he would seek the prosecution of the commanders of federal military units responsible for the death or disappearance of civilians in Chechnya (specifically Major General Aleksandr Studenikin). In addition, Kadyrov said the war in Chechnya was unleashed not by the Chechen people but by the Russian leadership. Kadyrov&#x27;s comments may have represented his government&#x27;s increasing unhappiness with certain figures in Moscow, who were said to be blocking his elevation to the post of Chechen president. In 2006, leaked cables from an American diplomat recounted a lavish wedding attended by Kadyrov in Russia&#x27;s Caucasus region in which guests threw $100 bills at child dancers, and which had nighttime &quot;water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea&quot;, and a report that Kadyrov gave the newly married couple a &quot;five-kilo lump of gold&quot;.

On 5 February 2007, Kadyrov said he did not aspire to become the Chechen president; however, he criticised Alkhanov. Kadyrov also claimed the war in Chechnya was ultimately finished, with &quot;all informal armed groups eliminated&quot;. Alkhanov, for his part, criticised &quot;the cult of personality and idealisation of one person&quot;, a clear reference to Kadyrov, whose enormous portraits are prominently displayed in Grozny.

===President of the Chechen Republic===
On 15 February 2007, Putin signed a decree removing Alkhanov and installing Kadyrov as Chechen&#x27;s acting president. On 2 March 2007, following Putin&#x27;s nomination of Kadyrov as Chechen president, the Chechen parliament approved the nomination. In the following days, serious changes took place in the administrative setup of the republic, affecting both the top- and middle-ranking officials. Former deputy prime minister Odes Baysultanov (a cousin of Kadyrov) was elevated to the vacant post of prime minister. Critics allege that Kadyrov is actively building his own &quot;vertical of power&quot; in the republic, and encouraging nepotism by placing men of his own family (Kadyrov) in all the leading and important positions.

A Russian daily, &quot;Gazeta&quot;, reported that according to a poll conducted by the independent Levada Center, only 33 percent of Russians believe that Kadyrov can be trusted, while 35 percent believed that he cannot. Asked whether they thought Kadyrov could normalise the situation in Chechnya and end the bloodshed there, 31 percent said yes and 38 percent said no.

On 14 March 2007, Kadyrov said that human rights abuses were &quot;a thing of the past&quot; in his republic, rejecting new charges of torture made by the Council of Europe. Two days later he accused the federal authorities of torturing detainees. On 19 March 2007, Kadyrov vowed to put an end to all remaining guerilla activity in Chechnya within two months. On 5 April 2007, Kadyrov was sworn in as President of Chechnya. He appointed his maternal cousin Odes Baysultanov as the Prime Minister of the republic on 10 April.
After the car-bomb attack on Yunus-bek Yevkurov, president of the neighbouring Republic of Ingushetia on 22 June 2009, Kadyrov claimed that the Kremlin had ordered him to fight insurgents there, and during his subsequent visit to the republic on 24 June pledged ruthless vengeance.

In late December 2009, Kadyrov claimed that remaining rebels were getting financed by &quot;The West&quot;; &quot;I officially declare this: those who destroyed the Soviet Union, those who want to destroy the Russian Federation, they stand behind them&quot;. He also suggested that Russia should attack Georgia and Ukraine &quot;It&#x27;s Russia&#x27;s private affliction; why should we always suffer if we can eradicate this for good?&quot;. In early August 2010, Kadyrov had claimed that there were only 70 Islamist militants left in Chechnya.

In the same month, he proposed changing the title of &quot;President of the Chechen Republic&quot; to &quot;Head of the Chechen Republic&quot;. On 12 August, he also called upon presidents of all North Caucasus republics to petition the State Duma to change their titles, stating that there should only be one president in Russia. The Chechen parliament unanimously approved this change on 2 September. However, Speaker of the Chechen Parliament Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov stated on 4 September that the title will be retained until the end of Kadyrov&#x27;s term in April 2011.

In February 2011, he invited the players of Brazil&#x27;s 2002 FIFA World Cup winning team to play a match against a Chechen football team led by Kadyrov. The Brazilian team was named as Brazil XI. In addition, Ruud Gullit was hired by Kadyrov to train FC Terek Grozny.

====Attempted assassination====
An assassination attempt on Kadyrov and a parliament member Adam Delimkhanov was thwarted on 23 October 2009 by the police. Chechen Deputy interior minister Roman Edilov said the police shot dead the driver of a speeding car loaded with a 200-litre tank after firing warning shots shortly before Kadyrov was to arrive at a construction site. The driver of the car was later identified as a militant leader (so-called Urus-Martan emir Beslan Bashtayev).

Said-Emi Khizriev, who played a role in organising the attack, was killed by Russian police who tried to arrest him in the Michurin village in Grozny. Khizriev planned and took part in explosions at two gas stations in Gudermes in the spring of the previous year, as well as in an armed attack at a sport club in the city.

====Attempts at consolidation of the Chechen nation====

As reported by the Caucasian Knot, an independent human rights resource, on 5 February 2009, &quot;in the course of his meeting in Grozny with Ramzan Ampukaev, representative of the Chechen Diaspora in Europe, Ramzan Kadyrov invited former militants, now living in Europe, to come back home&quot;:

&quot;Now, the situation in the republic has stabilized, we witness a steady economic growth, and there&#x27;s no sense for people to leave. And those who are already abroad, can always come back. We&#x27;ll help them in every possible way,&quot; said Mr. Kadyrov. &quot;All sorts of Emirs and former participants of illegal armed formations, who are now in Europe and whose actions were not aggravated by bloody crimes, have two alternatives: either to come back and serve for the welfare of their homeland, or stay there until the end of their days.&quot;

====Tsentoroy and Chechen Parliament attacks====
In 2010, two large scale attacks were carried out by Chechen insurgents, one in Kadyrov&#x27;s home-village Tsentoroy and the other on Chechen Parliament in Grozny. The assault on Tsentoroy which occurred on 29 August is considered to have &quot;shattered&quot; the image of Kadyrov&#x27;s unshakeable rule in Chechnya, as it was the first time in six years that his seemingly impregnable village had come under attack.

On 2 September, Kadyrov announced a reward of more than $300,000 for information about each of the insurgency leaders involved in the operation, which Chechen commentators interpreted as an indicator of the government&#x27;s weakness. Kadyrov also tightened his control over information coming from Tsentoroy by not allowing any of the village&#x27;s 5,000 inhabitants to leave in the days after the attack. The citizenry were also allegedly under the threat of death not to talk about the siege or the damage inflicted by the rebels.

The attack on the Chechen parliament was carried out by three Chechen rebels on 19 October 2010. Kadyrov, dressed in a parade uniform, attended a meeting that was held a few hours after all the buildings of the parliament were declared cleared by the special forces. During the meeting, he apologised to the politicians who escaped unhurt from the attack. Kadyrov vowed to intensify the fight against militants in the republic, calling them &quot;bandits&quot;. He also blamed the United Kingdom and Poland saying they were &quot;harbouring criminals. Why do they shield bandits who have shed blood where there is western democracy? Where is the justice? ... Sooner or later Zakayev, Gakayev, Umarov, Vadalov and other criminals will get what they deserve ... I have no doubt that it was the drunk and alcoholic Akhmed Zakayev and his backers in London and other western capitals. I want to say that they will not achieve anything. The Chechen republic is still standing. It is a peaceful and stable region.&quot;

===Head of the Chechen Republic===
Kadyrov was nominated to a second term as president (now referred to as Head of the Chechen Republic) by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 28 February 2011 and was unanimously elected for a second term by the Chechen Parliament on 5 March 2011. After his election, he stated that he was going to continue the current course of reviving the republic&#x27;s economy and society.

On 8 March, he captained a Chechen football team which included current players of FC Terek Grozny, former players of Soviet Union national football team and former German midfielder Lothar Matthaeus in a match against the team Brazil XI which included ex-Brazilian footballers like Romario, Dunga, Bebeto and Cafu. Kadyrov scored twice during the match but his team lost 6–4 to the Brazilian side. Kadyrov said that he had organised the match to show that Chechnya had recovered from years of separatist conflict. He also said that the Brazilians weren&#x27;t paid to appear but came out of goodwill and in return for a donation to flood victims in Brazil.

Kadyrov was sworn in as head of the republic on 5 April 2011. In November 2012, he visited Azerbaijan to sign intergovernmental agreements. In December 2012, he ordered the closure of the newspaper &quot;Kadyrov&#x27;s Path&quot; after one of its reporters asked Putin a question about the violence once focused in Chechnya spreading to other republics and followed it up by asking about the fate of a local radio station. Kadyrov had reportedly taken a disliking to the question asked by the reporter to Putin.

Kadyrov termed former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych&#x27;s ousting as a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and a deliberate attempt to exert pressure on Russia through Ukraine, however at the same time placed the blame on Yanukovych for the situation in Ukraine. On 28 February 2014, he affirmed his readiness to dispatch peacekeepers and a consignment of humanitarian aid to Crimea.

After the 2014 Grozny bombing, in which ISIL&#x27;s hand was suspected, he said that he might block internet in Chechnya as anyone could easily find and listen to a sermon by a jihadist. After Kadyrov went on a tirade against ISIL on Instagram for threatening Russia, ISIL commander Omar al-Shishani put a $5 million bounty on him.

On 26 May 2015, he announced that he was going to star in a Hollywood thriller titled &quot;Whoever Doesn&#x27;t Understand Will Get It&quot; which will be directed by a director of famous Hollywood films and also feature global film-stars. Kadyrov in July 2015 denied that ISIL had any territory in Chechnya and claimed that they never will. During an interview in October 2015, he suggested that Putin should send Chechen special forces to Syria claiming they will wipe out ISIL in weeks. On 3 December, he promised revenge against ISIL for beheading of Khasiev. On 8 February 2016, he claimed that Chechen special forces had infiltrated ISIL cells.

Kadyrov announced on 27 February 2016 that he would step down at the end of his second term, which was set to expire on 5 April. However, he later decided to run in the elections that were to be held that September. Putin appointed him as the acting head of Chechnya until the elections in a decree signed on 25 March.

Kadyrov launched his reality show titled &quot;The Team&quot; with the first episode being aired by Channel One on 30 June. People from across Russia were invited by Kadyrov to register for the contest. The winner of the contest will go on to become head of Chechnya&#x27;s Agency for Strategic Development.

On 18 September 2016, Kadyrov was re-elected with nearly 98% of the vote. Philip Varychenko, a native of Düsseldorf, was chosen as the winner of Kadyrov&#x27;s reality show on 22 November and was appointed as a government aide. Kadyrov visited Saudi Arabia on 27 November where he met the Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. During the meeting, they discussed Russia–Saudi Arabia relations as well as issues of common interest. He also visited the United Arab Emirates on the same day and met Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. The two discussed friendship, cooperation and strengthening ties. During his visits, he praised King Salman of Saudi Arabia for his &quot;leadership of the Muslim world and efforts to combat extremism&quot;.

On 28 November, he stated that veterans of American special forces would not be allowed to train security and intelligence personnel at a &quot;tactical city&quot; in Gudermes because &quot;they weren&#x27;t as good as Russian special forces and there were sanctions against all official structures from the United States.&quot; On 29 November, he claimed in an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat that only a few dozen Chechens were fighting with ISIL, adding that most of them grew up in Western Europe. He also stated that measures taken by Chechen authorities had been successful in bringing back many young recruits before they reached Syria.

During an interview aired on 27 November 2017, Kadyrov stated that he was ready to resign as Head of the Chechen Republic, calling it his &quot;dream&quot; as he found the responsibility to be &quot;too heavy&quot;. He announced on 5 December that no Chechen athletes will participate under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics.

After an attack on the Church of Archangel Michael in Grozny on 19 May 2018, Kadyrov stated that he had personally overseen the operation to eliminate the attackers. On 26 September, he signed an agreement with Yunus-bek Yevkurov, the Head of Ingushetia, resolving the border dispute between the two Russian republics. The agreement seen as grossly unfair to Ingushestia ignited widespread protests eventually leading to resignation of Yevkurov on 24 June 2019.

Kadyrov was given the rank of major general in July 2020, through an executive order of the Russian president. He added on his blog that he had been transferred from Ministry of Internal Affairs to the National Guard of Russia.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
During the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia, Kadyrov initially in March 2020 dismissed the spread of the disease as nothing serious. Later, Chechnya imposed strict measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after it first emerged in the republic. In an interview to Caucasian Knot, Kadyrov purportedly stated that infected people violating self-quarantine should be killed. People accused of spreading rumors have also been forced to admit their guilt and apologize on live television broadcasts by Kadyrov, though human rights organizations have claimed they were pressured.

In April 2020, Kadyrov announced imposition of even stricter measures in Chechnya to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In addition to a night curfew, the government also sealed off all transportation to regions outside the republic. Kadyrov meanwhile also denied that force was being used against those who defied the restrictions. After the Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin criticized heads of Russian regions for overstepping the extent of their powers with the restrictions they imposed, Kadyrov commented that while he did not know if Mishustin referred to Chechnya, goods as well as entry into the republic were not barred. However, entry of non-Chechens into the republic would be banned to curb the spread of the disease.

On 15 May 2020, Kadyrov in a live broadcast on the state-run Grozny TV stated that medical workers protesting over lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) must be sacked after one such protest occurred in Gudermes, claiming the republic had enough PPE.

====Russian invasion of Ukraine====

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kadyrov was reported to have been taking part in Russian operations outside Kyiv. In a video he posted on Telegram, he called on Ukrainian forces to surrender &quot;or you will be finished&quot;. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin had no information about whether Kadyrov was in Ukraine. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that on two occasions when Kadyrov had said he was in Ukraine, he was proven not to be. In one instance, he said he was in Mariupol at a petrol station and published a photo, but the brand shown in the background, Rosneft&#x27;s Pulsar, did not operate in Ukraine. On another occasion, Kadyrov posted a video suggesting he was meeting troops in Mariupol, but he hosted a Russian official in Grozny on the same day.

On 28 March 2022, President Putin promoted Kadyrov to the rank of lieutenant general. On 26 May, Kadyrov threatened Poland. He was apparently upset by the Polish supply of weapons to Ukraine. On 10 September, upset by the withdrawal of Russian troops in Izium, he called for the declaration of martial law and full military mobilization in Russia. On 22 September, he stated that the 2022 Russian mobilization would not be implemented in the Chechen Republic.

On 1 October 2022, Kadyrov called on Russia to use low-yield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, in response to Russia losing the important Ukrainian town of Lyman. Two days later, he announced he was deploying three underage sons, aged 14, 15, and 16, as child soldiers to the front line in Ukraine, a possible war crime. On 5 October, he announced that President Putin had promoted him from lieutenant general to the rank of colonel general.
In February 2023, a close ally of Kadyrov, General Apti Alaudinov was reportedly poisoned by a letter laced with toxin. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in May 2024 cited Russian opposition sources as stating that Alaudinov had gained a positive reputation within the federal government after helping integrate many former Wagner Group members into the 141st Motorized Regiment following their rebellion, and was favored as a successor to Kadyrov by the defense establishment amid rumors about his ill health.

Although both Kadyrov and the Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin supported each other in verbally attacking the Russian defense establishment during the Ukraine invasion, the Kadyrovites supported the Russian government during the Wagner Group rebellion in June 2023 with Kadyrov accusing Prigozhin of backstabbing. The Kadyrovites however did not engage the Wagner Group, and in August 2023, Kadyrov praised the legacy of Prigozhin. Russian opposition leader Dmitry Gudkov then warned that Kadyrov might suffer the same fate as Prigozhin.
Kadyrov stated in May 2023 that Chechnya had sent over 26,000 soldiers, including 12,000 volunteers, to Ukraine, with 7,000 of them taking part in active battles at the time. He offered to send 3,000 more under the command of the Russian Defence Ministry and the Russian National Guard in November 2023. In May 2024, he stated that 43,500 soldiers from Chechnya had served in Ukraine, including 18,000 volunteers, and offered to send additional &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of reservists during a meeting with Putin.

Kadyrov on 24 May 2024 suggested the name of former speaker of the Parliament of the Chechen Republic Magomed Daudov for the position of Prime Minister of Chechnya, following the resignation of Prime Minister Muslim Khuchiev. Daudov, known for his loyalty to Kadyrov, had overseen Chechnya&#x27;s response to COVID-19 and recruitment of Chechens into the Russian military for the invasion of Ukraine. Daudov was approved by the Chechen Parliament on the next day.

== Chechen economic recovery and reconstruction ==
In 2006, the production of Chechnya&#x27;s industry increased by 11.9%. In 2007, the rate of growth was 26.4%.

In February 2010, head of the British delegation of the Human Rights Group Lord Judd, formerly &quot;bitterly critical of the Russian authorities for the situation in Chechnya&quot;, pointed out a striking change for the better in the Russian North Caucasus republic. Judd said that changes which occurred since his visit as a member of PACE delegation in 2000 were &quot;so overwhelming that sometimes you forget about what happened here until quite recently&quot;.

According to a 2016 report by Russian opposition leader Ilya Yashin, Kadyrov collected enormous wealth, primarily through theft of federal subsidies for Chechnya. Between 2001 and 2014 Chechnya has received over 464 billion roubles in subsidies, grants and donations with federal subsidies accounting for 80% of the republic&#x27;s budget (and this does not include funds allocated for infrastructure managed at federal level such as roads). However, the administration of Chechnya is being criticized for spending public funds for their personal benefit—in 2010 Dmitry Medvedev noted that &quot;federal funds often do not reach people; we know where they disappear; it is obvious-they are being stolen&quot;.

For example, the fleet of official vehicles in Chechnya accounts for half of all official vehicles in all Northern Caucasus republics. Public funds are being funnelled through Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation, which—while being registered as a charity—has never produced or published any financial reports as required by Russian law.

These violations are ignored by Russian Ministry of Justice, which in many cases has enforced them very strictly against other charities. The foundation operates a building company that services most of the publicly procured infrastructure projects in the republic and also collects a fee from all working citizens of Chechnya, ranging from 10 to 30% of their earnings, raising 3–4 billion roubles per year this way. Kadyrov himself declares annual income of 4.84 million roubles (2015), which is inconsistent with his lavish life-style, luxury vehicles, watches, race horses and mansions.

In 2020, Proekt.media published an in-depth analysis of business operations of Kadyrov and Adam Delimkhanov who are allegedly running multi-million dollar businesses in Moscow through a proxy provided by businessman Pavel Krotov.

== Policies ==
=== Human rights ===

Kadyrov has been personally implicated in several instances of torture and murder. A number of Chechens opposed to Kadyrov have been assassinated abroad, and several witnesses (including Artur Kurmakaev and Ruslan Khalidov) report the existence of a 300 name &quot;Murder List&quot;. Chechens who have been murdered, where Kadyrov&#x27;s involvement is suspected, include Movladi Baisarov and Ruslan Yamadayev (both Moscow); Sulim Yamadayev (Dubai); Gazhi Edilsutanov, Islam Dzahnibekov, Ali Osaev (Istanbul); and Umar Israilov (Vienna).

Kadyrov stated in December 2009 that he had personally helped many of the murder victims and their families and was not their enemy. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to kill, who did I fight? I fought terrorists. Who did I protect? I protected the whole of Russia so that people in Moscow or St. Petersburg...could live in peace. They accuse me of killing women and children. It&#x27;s not true.&quot;

* A mutinied commander, Movladi Baisarov, said that Kadyrov &quot;acts like a medieval tyrant. If someone tells the truth about what is going on, it&#x27;s like signing one&#x27;s own death warrant. Ramzan is a law unto himself. He can do anything he likes. He can take any woman and do whatever he pleases with her. (...) Ramzan acts with total impunity. I know of many people executed on his express orders and I know exactly where they were buried&quot;. On 18 November 2006, Baisarov was killed in an ambush by members of Kadyrov&#x27;s police on Moscow&#x27;s Leninsky Prospekt, about two kilometres from the Kremlin.
* On 13 November 2006, Human Rights Watch published a briefing paper on torture in Chechnya that it had prepared for the 37th session of the United Nations Committee Against Torture. The paper covered torture by personnel of the Second Operational Investigative Bureau (ORB-2), torture by units under the effective command of Kadyrov, torture in secret detentions and the continuing &quot;forced disappearances&quot;. According to HRW, torture &quot;in both official and secret detention facilities is widespread and systematic in Chechnya&quot;. In many cases the perpetrators were so confident that there would be no consequences for their abuses that they did not even attempt to conceal their identity. Based on extensive research, HRW concluded in 2005 that forced disappearances in Chechnya are so widespread and systematic that they constitute crimes against humanity.
* Anna Politkovskaya, a veteran Russian reporter (murdered in 2006) who reported extensively from Chechnya, claimed that she had received a grainy video footage shot on a mobile phone of a man identical in appearance to Kadyrov, and said that &quot;the clips were the murders of federal servicemen by the Kadyrovites, and also kidnappings directed by Kadyrov. These are very serious things; on the basis of this evidence a criminal case and investigation should follow. This could allow this person to be brought to justice, something he has long richly deserved.&quot; On 7 October 2006, Politkovskaya was found shot dead in an elevator in her apartment in Moscow. She was allegedly working on an article revealing human rights abuses and regular incidents of torture in Chechnya at the time of her murder. Some observers alleged that Kadyrov or his men were possibly behind the assassination.
* On 23 October 2006, a criminal case was registered on the basis of the video tape frames published by the &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; newspaper in Anna Politkovskaya&#x27;s article. Sergey Sokolov, deputy editor-in-chief of the paper, told the Echo Moskvy Radio that it can be clearly seen in the video as to how &quot;Kadyrov&#x27;s military forces are beating federal soldiers&quot; with participation of &quot;a man looking like Ramzan Kadyrov&quot;.
* German human rights group the Society for Threatened Peoples (GfbV), which branded Kadyrov a &quot;war criminal&quot;, has alleged that up to 75 percent of recent incidents of murder, torture, rape, and kidnapping in Chechnya have been committed by Kadyrov&#x27;s paramilitary forces.
* The Memorial group investigator stated in its report: &quot;Considering the evidence we have gathered, we have no doubt that most of the crimes which are being committed now in Chechnya are the work of Kadyrov&#x27;s men. There is also no doubt in our minds that Kadyrov has personally taken part in beating and torturing people. What they are doing is pure lawlessness. To make matters worse, they also go after people who are innocent, whose names were given by someone being tortured to death. He and his henchmen spread fear and terror in Chechnya. (...) They travel by night as death squads, kidnapping civilians, who are then locked in a torture chamber, raped and murdered&quot;.
* According to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, many illegal places of detention exist in the Chechen Republic; most of them are run by &quot;Kadyrovites&quot;. In Tsentaroy (Khosi-Yurt), where the Kadyrovite headquarters is located, there are at least two illegal prisons functioning. One consists of concrete bunkers or pillboxes, where kidnapped relatives of armed Chechen fighters are held hostage while the second prison in Tsentaroy is evidently located in the yard—or in immediate vicinity—of the house of Kadyrov.
* The Kadyrovites are often accused of working as a death squad against Kadyrov&#x27;s enemies. Kadyrov is rumoured to own a private prison in his stronghold of Tsentaroy, his home village south-east of Grozny. Fields around Tsentaroy are allegedly mined and all access routes are blocked by checkpoints. On 2 May 2006, representatives of the Council of Europe&#x27;s Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) alleged that they were prevented from entering the fortress.
* A video leaked out in which armed men, loyal to Kadyrov, displayed the severed head of a Chechen guerrilla (who was killed in July 2006) for public display in the village of Kurchaloi. They mounted the head on a pipe, together with blood-stained trousers and put a cigarette on him. It was displayed for at least a day as they came back a day later to record it again. On 21 September 2005, a similar incident occurred, as published by Memorial as well as Kavkazky Uzel which described &quot;shocking details&quot; of a special operation conducted by forces loyal to Kadyrov.
* On 1 March 2007, Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the head of the Moscow Helsinki Group rights organisation, stated that Kadyrov was &quot;to blame for kidnappings of many innocent people. Their bodies were found later with signs of torture.&quot;
*Umar Israilov was assassinated in Vienna on 13 January 2009. Israilov was a former Kadyrov bodyguard, who cooperated with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, extensively detailing abuses committed by Kadyrov and his associates. Israilov had told Austrian authorities in 2008 that he had been threatened by an agent sent by Kadyrov to drop his lawsuit against the Chechen leader at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. On 27 April 2010, the Austrian prosecutor&#x27;s office announced that they believed Kadyrov had ordered the kidnapping of Israilov and Israilov had been murdered while attempting to escape. According to the investigation, there was evidence that Otto Kaltenbrunner (adopted name of Ramzan Edilov), one of the suspected kidnappers, had been in contact with Kadyrov personally.
* On 15 July 2009, Natalia Estemirova, a member of Memorial society, who investigated the alleged abuses by government-backed militias in Chechnya, was abducted and shot to death. Memorial&#x27;s chairman Oleg Petrovich Orlov accused Kadyrov of being behind the murder, and claimed that Kadyrov had openly threatened her by saying: &quot;Yes, my arms are up to the elbows in blood. And I am not ashamed of that. I have killed and will kill bad people&quot;. Kadyrov denied any involvement in the killing and promised to investigate the killing personally. He condemned the killers, and in response to Orlov&#x27;s accusations, said: &quot;You are not a prosecutor or a judge therefore your claims about my guilt are not ethical, to put it mildly, and are insulting to me. I am sure that you have to think about my rights before declaring for everyone to hear that I am guilty of Estemirova&#x27;s death.&quot; It was later reported that Kadyrov would be suing Memorial for defamation and slander, targeting Orlov personally with his complaint.
* Memorial said in a statement on 19 August 2014 that when Kadyrov had lost his mobile phone during a wedding ceremony on 16 August, the police questioned thousands of people who had attended the wedding into early hours of the next morning in an attempt to find it.
* A man who criticised local officials and apparently Kadyrov in a YouTube appeal to the Russian president became a target of many threats due to which he had to flee to the neighboring republic of Dagestan. In May 2016, his house was burnt down by a group of masked men and his family was dragged out, put in a car and were thrown under a bridge. His wife also stated that they threatened the other residents with burning down their houses as well if they reported about the matter to anyone. Later, the Chechen police cordoned off his village in order to hunt him down. Kadyrov&#x27;s spokesman denied these reports were true. The complainant later publicly apologised to Kadyrov and accused the media of distorting his remarks in his video complaint. He again fled to Dagestan in November 2016. According to human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina, he had to flee after Chechnya&#x27;s Deputy Interior Minister Apti Alaudinov personally threatened to kill him.
* After Memorial&#x27;s Chechnya head Oyub Titiev was arrested in January 2018 over drug possession, Oyub&#x27;s supporters claimed the charges were fake and were made-up by the Chechen authorities to suppress criticism of Kadyrov. Kadyrov called Oyub a &quot;drug addict&quot; while criticising those working with human rights activists and warned them off from working in his region.
* On 30 January 2020, Imran Aliev, an anti-Kadyrov blogger, was murdered in a hotel in Lille. French authorities have identified the alleged killer as a hitman having connections with the Chechen leader and who had travelled with Aliev in a train from Belgium to France.
* Tumso Abdurakhmanov, a dissident Chechen blogger, was attacked in February 2020, but managed to overpower the assailant, who claimed he had been sent by Moscow. Swedish prosecutors stated that the Chechen government was suspected of being involved in the attack. &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; reported on the trial in November, saying the attacker admitted that he was sent by the Chechen government, but had planned to fail. Another arrested suspect denied her own involvement.
* On the evening of 20 January 2022, Zarema Yangulbayeva (), the wife of Saidi Yangulbaev, a former judge of the Supreme Court of Chechnya, was abducted in Nizhny Novgorod and taken to Chechnya for interrogation. A day later, she was charged with assaulting a police officer. Kadyrov said the former judge&#x27;s family members would either be in prison or underground and asked the Supreme Court of Russia to &quot;kick out&quot; Yangulbaev from the reserve and &quot;erase his name from the history of the judicial body&quot;. Yangulbaev lost his position as a judge in 2015, saying he was forced to do so. Yangulbayeva is the mother of Abubakar Yangulbaev, a Chechen human rights activist and former lawyer for the Committee for the Prevention of Torture NGO.
* On 6 May 2024, Abdurakhmanov published a video showing a man burning a car bearing symbols associated with Kadyrov&#x27;s son Adam in Grozny. Chechen authorities arrested around ninety people from Starye Atagi and Shali in response, with Abdullakh Magomadov being tortured to death in relation to the case while the death of another person was also believed to be connected to it. Authorities also targeted relatives of those arrested.

===Rounding up, torture and execution of gay men===
Kadyrov has previously encouraged extrajudicial killings of homosexual men by family members as an alternative to law enforcement – in some cases, gay men in prison have been released early specifically to enable their murder by relatives.

In April 2017, international media reported that gay men in Chechnya were being arrested, detained and tortured as part of a region-wide pogrom. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on 5 May that he would personally ask the Russian Prosecutor General and Interior Ministry to help Kremlin rights ombudswoman Tatyana Moskalkova check the reported abuse. UK Deputy Foreign Secretary Sir Alan Duncan told the UK Parliament he had been informed of alleged plans to eliminate Chechnya&#x27;s gay community by the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which commenced on 26 May 2017.

Chechnya has denied the reports, with its interior minister calling the allegations an &quot;April Fools&#x27; joke&quot;. Kadyrov&#x27;s spokesman Alvi Karimov rejected the allegations and described the report in the Russian newspaper, &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, as &quot;absolute lies and disinformation&quot;, basing his denial on the claim that &quot;you cannot detain and persecute people who simply do not exist in the republic. If there were such people in Chechnya, the law-enforcement organs wouldn&#x27;t need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would send them somewhere from which there is no returning.&quot; Vladimir Putin&#x27;s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that there had been no evidence found to support the allegations, adding that he had no reason to doubt Kadyrov&#x27;s claims that no one under his rule has been persecuted for their sexual orientation.

In an interview with HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports&quot; aired on 18 July, Kadyrov said, &quot;We don&#x27;t have those kind of people here. We don&#x27;t have any gays. If there are any take them to Canada. Praise be to God. Take them far from us so we don&#x27;t have them at home. To purify our blood, if there are any here, take them.&quot; He added that gay people were &quot;not human&quot;.

Asked about the accusations of systematic torture, Kadyrov said, &quot;They made it up. They are devils. They are for sale. They are subhuman. God damn them for slandering us.&quot;

===Sanctions===

Sanctioned by the UK government in 2014 in relation to Russo-Ukrainian War.

On 20 December 2017, the United States imposed sanctions under the Magnitsky Act on five Russian nationals including Kadyrov, accusing him of personal involvement in repression, torture and murder. U.S. officials accused him of heading &quot;an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings,&quot; and that one or more of his political opponents were killed at his direction. He was added to United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s blacklist which also included a Chechen security official Ayub Kataev along with three other Russian individuals for their criminal involvement in a corruption case uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky.

In response, Kadyrov mocked the sanctions on his Instagram account. &quot;A sleepless night is waiting for me.&quot; He further stated, &quot;I can be proud that I&#x27;m out of favor with the special services of the USA,&quot; and added, &quot;In fact, the USA cannot forgive me for dedicating my whole life to the fight against foreign terrorists among which there are bastards of America&#x27;s special services.&quot;

President Putin&#x27;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the sanctions &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;unfriendly&quot; stating, &quot;We consider these sanctions illegal, we consider them unfriendly, and we do not agree with them.&quot; He also stated that it was highly probable that Russia would retaliate by accusing U.S. officials or citizens of rights violations and banning them from the country.

Further sanctions were added on 20 July 2020, with United States Secretary of State accusing him of increasing abuses on civilians during the COVID-19 pandemic. His immediate family were also sanctioned. The sanctions also ban him, his wife and two of his daughters from traveling to the United States. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Sputnik that they will try to impose retaliatory sanctions. Kadyrov meanwhile posted a picture of himself along with firearms, saying, &quot;Pompeo, we accept the fight! What comes next will be more interesting.&quot;

===Threats to journalists===

In 2004, Kadyrov had a conversation with the &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; journalist Anna Politkovskaya. One of his assistants said to her, &quot;Someone ought to have shot you back in Moscow, right on the street, like they do in your Moscow&quot;. Ramzan then repeated after him, &quot;You&#x27;re an enemy. To be shot...&quot; He is alleged by some observers to be behind her murder.

On 13 April 2020, Kadyrov threatened the journalist Elena Milashina on Instagram for her news article in &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; about Chechnya&#x27;s coronavirus lockdown, stating it was &quot;defamatory&quot;. He also criticized the federal authorities for not taking any action saying, &quot;If you want us to commit a crime and become criminals, just say so! One [of us] will take on this responsibility and serve his time, as required by law.&quot; On Telegram, he later labeled her newspaper &quot;anti-Russian&quot; and a &quot;foreign agent&quot;, also claiming it stereotyped Chechens.

Milashina had also covered Chechnya&#x27;s gay purges and had been allegedly attacked on 6 February 2020. She accused the Chechen authorities of orchestrating the attack. Over 100 Russian celebrities and human rights activists, in response to Kadyrov&#x27;s online threats, called upon the federal government to protect Milashina. Novaya Gazeta was made to delete Milashina&#x27;s article from its website by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Russia, which claimed it was fake news and created a threat to the lives of citizens. Peskov dismissed Kadyrov&#x27;s threats as an emotional response, saying everyone was on edge due to the coronavirus pandemic. Human Rights Watch criticized Peskov&#x27;s reaction, stating it was &quot;like a stark green light to Chechen officials to act on their threats.&quot;

On 21 April 2020, the US government funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty stated that it had complained to Russian authorities after Kadyrov had threatened to punish their North Caucasus bureau chief Aslan Doukaev over an article against his government&#x27;s restrictive coronavirus lockdown measures against farmers in an online video.

The ambassador of United States to Russia, John J. Sullivan, condemned Kadyrov&#x27;s threats against Milashina and Aslan Doukaev, stating that freedom of press was a pillar of democracy. In a joint statement, French Human Rights Ambassador-at-Large François Croquette and the German Commissioner for Human Rights Policy Bärbel Kofler called Kadyrov&#x27;s threats against Milashina unacceptable and urged Russia to investigate.

Kadydov had personally warned to punish the Georgian journalist Giorgi Gabunia in June 2020, after he had insulted President Vladimir Putin on-air. The State Security Service of Georgia announced the arrest of a Russian citizen on 15 June for an assassination attempt on Gabunia. Georgian media and Gabunia&#x27;s boss later claimed the assassin was sent by Kadyrov, who denied the allegations and said that if he had sent someone to kill, they would have succeeded. Kadyrov called Gabunia his enemy and said that he should beg for forgiveness by getting down on his knees, otherwise he would continue to remain one. Georgian authorities have neither confirmed nor denied the allegations against Kadyrov.

==Social media use==

===Networks===
The number of subscribers to Kadyrov&#x27;s social networks in 2016 was more than three million people, including three million followers of his Instagram account, according to the Chechen leader&#x27;s press service. It said that he had 500,000 followers on the Russian VK social network, 760,860 on Facebook, 331,000 on Twitter and 5,447 on LiveJournal. Besides his Instagram postings, it was said that he had also made almost 5,000 on Twitter and 2,300 on VK. The Russian News Agency TASS said that Kadyrov had been &quot;recognized as the most quoted Russian blogger.&quot;

In August 2016, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Kadyrov had posted nearly 8,000 pictures on Instagram, which made him the online mobile photo-sharing, video-sharing, and social networking service&#x27;s &quot;most prolific political strongman&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Kadyrov&#x27;s Instagram account &quot;bizarre if strangely compelling&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; said it was &quot;flashy&quot;. In a 2015 article, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Kadyrov was &quot;Instagram-addicted&quot;.

The Russian programme director of Human Rights Watch said in an October 2016 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;even the mildest criticism on social media [is] ruthlessly punished through unlawful, punitive detention, enforced disappearances, cruel and degrading treatment, death threats, threats against family members, and physical abuse of family members.&quot; She said that a social worker from a small town in Chechnya made a WhatsApp recording that went viral among Chechen users &quot;imploring&quot; Kadyrov &quot;to look into the plight of ordinary people pushed below the poverty line&quot; by local officials. The article stated that the woman, with her husband, &quot;found herself hauled into the studio of Grozny TV, the state television and radio broadcaster&quot; to face Kadyrov in person, &quot;to apologise publicly for her lies.&quot; A &quot;severe and sweeping repression by the local authorities is designed to remind the Chechen public of Kadyrov&#x27;s total control,&quot; the article claimed.

===WhatsApp interventions===
In May 2015, Kadyrov gave a stern televised lecture to a group of Chechen men and women who were accused of using the WhatsApp messaging service to comment on the impending marriage of a local police chief to a teenage girl some three decades younger than him. The wedding had been widely discussed across Russia on reports that the young woman, Kheda Goylabiyeva, was being coerced into marriage with the chief, Nazhud Guchigov.

&quot;Behave like Chechens&quot;, Kadyrov was reported as telling the assemblage of about a dozen people standing in the marbled courtyard of what appeared to be his government palace. &quot;Honor of the family is the most important thing. Don&#x27;t write such things any more. You, men, keep your women away from WhatsApp.&quot; In its coverage of the incident, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported:

&quot;Lock them in, do not let them go out, and they will not post anything&quot;, Mr. Kadyrov said in a video to a sheepish group of men and women who kept their arms folded across their chests and their eyes firmly on the ground during the harangue.

In December 2015, a female Chechen social worker criticised Kadyrov in an audio message posted on WhatsApp, after her boss tried to force her to allocate some money from her salary to be collateral for her next month&#x27;s payment. Three days after posting the message, she appeared on Grozny TV along with her husband, where she was publicly berated by Kadyrov as well as parliament speaker Daudov, presidential administration head Islam Kadyrov and her boss. The couple apologised on live television for her message.

===John Oliver===
In May 2016, Kadyrov engaged in a brief Instagram dispute with US television host John Oliver. Kadyrov had posted a message on Instagram asking for help in finding his lost cat. The posting led Oliver to make a five-minute segment on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; dealing with the cat&#x27;s disappearance and, according to &quot;The Guardian,&quot; Kadyrov&#x27;s penchant for posting of, for example, &quot;regular videos of his work-outs in the gym&quot;, also on Instagram. In addition, Oliver teased Kadyrov &quot;for his propensity&quot; to wear T-shirts bearing the image of Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the show, Oliver posted a photo of himself holding a cat, captioned &quot;@RKadyrov Is this your cat?&quot; Kadyrov responded in English, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; along with a doctored photo of Oliver wearing a Putin T-shirt, captioned, in part, &quot;I am tired of jokes. I want to care for cats in Chechnya. By the way, Putin is our leader.&quot;

===Account suspensions===

Kadyrov stated that he found his Russian-language Instagram and Facebook accounts were not working on 23 December 2017, and he never received a response from Instagram after sending a request for service support. His English-language Instagram account remained unaffected however. Kadyrov accused them of bowing to pressure from United States after he was sanctioned.
He wrote on Telegram in response, &quot;Instagram&#x27;s move, which still wants to pretend it is independent from officials of Washington is weird.&quot; He added, &quot;They wanted to stir my indignation, but were wrong, and this is the only thing which pleases me in actions Instagram and their patrons in the White House are undertaking. I have planned already to quit the network. But I thought I could fail my friends and subscribers, as on Instagram and Facebook I have more than 4 million followers.&quot;
The Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin stated that the decision by Facebook and Instagram to suspend Kadyrov&#x27;s accounts violated his rights, stating, &quot;They are afraid of a public conversation and the truth. Such decision cannot be explained in another way… The thing is that to read bloggers in social networks one needs to be their subscribers. By deleting an account, they deprive citizens of their right to know about bloggers&#x27; opinion and to communicate with them.&quot;

Russia&#x27;s telecommunications overseer Roskomnadzor on 26 December asked Facebook to explain why they had suspended his accounts. Facebook issued a statement on 28 December that it did so after he was sanctioned by United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control as these came under trade sanctions.

== Other issues ==

===Call to quarantine proceeds of horse race===
On 3 November 2009, a horse owned by Kadyrov, Mourilyan, came third in the Melbourne Cup winning about US$380,000 in prize money. The leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Bob Brown, immediately called for the Government of Australia to quarantine the prize money until assurances are received as to how the money will be used. Concerns had been previously raised that the Melbourne Cup could be used to launder money by overseas individuals.

=== Honor killings ===
In 2009, Kadyrov stated his approval of honor killings of seven women, based on the belief that they were engaging in adultery. In an interview with David Scott of HBO, he condoned honor killings of homosexuals in July 2017 stating, &quot;If we have [gay] people here, I&#x27;m telling you officially their relatives won&#x27;t let them be because of our faith, our mentality, customs, traditions. Even if it&#x27;s punishable under the law, we would still condone it.&quot;

=== WikiLeaks ===
On 28 November 2010, the US diplomatic cables leak named Kadyrov as a &quot;starring guest&quot; at some of Dagestan&#x27;s most elaborate weddings, which indicates the political &quot;Caucasus power structure&quot; in these weddings. In 2006, leaked cables from an American diplomat recounted a lavish wedding attended by Kadyrov in Russia&#x27;s Caucasus region in which guests threw $100 bills at child dancers, and which had nighttime &quot;water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea&quot;, and a report that Kadyrov gave the newly married couple a &quot;five-kilo lump of gold&quot;.

=== &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; cartoons ===
In January 2015, Kadyrov said he would organize protests if a Russian newspaper published the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; cartoons, saying &quot;we will not allow anyone to insult the Prophet [Muhammad], even if it will cost us our lives.&quot; He also stated that Alexei Venediktov &quot;will be brought to account&quot; after his radio station Ekho Moskvy took a survey of readers on whether to publish the cartoons. Venediktov stated he would ask the authorities to intervene against Kadyrov&#x27;s threats. During a protest rally against the cartoons attended by hundreds of thousands of people in Chechnya, he accused those backing Charlie Hebdo of using &quot;false slogans about free speech and democracy&quot;.

After French teacher Samuel Paty was murdered by a man of Chechen descent for showing the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in his class, Kadyrov criticized the attack, but also told people to not provoke the religious sentiments of Muslims. He also criticized French society for provoking Muslims and stated that the country must have a state institution focusing on inter-ethnic and inter-faith relations. After France&#x27;s President Emmanuel Macron defended Paty&#x27;s actions under the right to free speech, Kadyrov on Instagram accused him of forcing people to resort to terrorism by doing so.

=== Support for polygamy ===
Kadyrov supports polygamy in Muslim-majority republics in Russia, and believes that Muslims who speak out against the practice are not true adherents to their faith. According to Kadyrov, men legally marrying more than one wife would be more honest than having many mistresses, and would resolve Russia&#x27;s demographic problem. In April 2018, he stated that all Muslim men are permitted by Allah to have four wives but discouraged having the marriages officially registered. He also denied reports that polygamy would be legalised in Chechnya.

=== Boston Marathon bombing ===
After the Boston Marathon bombing, Kadyrov expressed sadness for the victims but denied the suspects had any ties to his region in a statement on his Instagram. He suggested that the suspects were products of American upbringing. Kadyrov accused the CIA of framing Dzokhar Tsarnaev on 18 March 2015, after he was handed a death sentence for the Boston Marathon Bombing and said that they could not have conducted the bombing without CIA&#x27;s knowledge.

=== Threats to opposition politicians ===
On 31 January 2016, Kadyrov posted a video of Russian opposition politicians Mikhail Kasyanov and Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza in the crosshairs of a gun on his Instagram blog. In a few days, after multiple complaints, Instagram removed the video prompting Kadyrov to criticize the decision: &quot;This is the much-boasted freedom of speech in America! You can write anything but cannot touch those American dogs, those friends of the Congress and the State Department&quot;.

===Report by Ilya Yashin===
Russian opposition leader Ilya Yashin authored a report against Kadyrov released on 23 February 2016 during a press conference which was repeatedly interrupted by police and hecklers. He also claimed that Kadyrov had murdered Boris Nemtsov. The report titled &quot;A National Security Threat&quot; claimed that Kadyrov poses a threat to Russia. It included allegations of corruption, authoritarian rule, secret prisons, rigging votes in favour of Vladimir Putin, stealing from the country&#x27;s national budget to enrich himself, enforcing Sharia law over Russian law, his lavish lifestyle, building and maintaining a personal army of about 30,000 fighters, purported ties to organised crime figures, and his involvement in politically motivated murders of journalists, human rights activists and political opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The report contained 20 questions which Yashin had invited Kadyrov to answer but was refused. Kadyrov dismissed the report calling it &quot;nothing but idle chatter&quot; and posted it on his social network accounts before its release. His spokesman filed a request with the Russian Prosecutor General and the Investigative Committee for Yashin to be arrested for the report saying it contained slander and insults against Kadyrov.

===Grozny fatwa===

In August 2016, Kadyrov convened a conference of Islamic scholars, funded by the Tabah Foundation in the United Arab Emirates, in Grozny. The conference was attended by notable Islamic scholars, including the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed el-Tayeb; the Grand Mufti of Egypt, Shawki Allam; the ex-Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Gomaa, Usama al-Azhari, who is the religious adviser to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; Habib Ali al-Jifri, and the mufti of Damascus, Abdul Fattah al-Bizm.

The conference was convened to discuss the alleged abuse of Islamic ideas to propagate extremism and to establish the criteria for determining who are the true followers of the Sunnah. The assembly of scholars issued a fatwa which declared that those who abide by the Kalam, belong to the four madhhabs and follow the path of moral self-perfection espoused by distinguished Islamic teachers, primarily the Sufi sheikhs, were the only true believers. The fatwa called the sect of Salafism a &quot;dangerous and erroneous contemporary sect&quot;, along with extremist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and Hizb ut-Tahrir.

The conference issued two further documents. In the first, it appealed to President Vladimir Putin to ban Salafism and term any condemnation of &quot;traditional Islam&quot; as &quot;extremism&quot;. It proposed the fatwa be regarded as the considered opinion of &quot;leading Russian experts&quot; when evaluating the activity of Muslim organizations and the preaching of individual clerics. The second document issued a resolution calling for the establishment of a Council for Islamic Education and a Council of Ulema, which would rule on who is and is not a true follower of Sunni Islam.

The ruling created a controversy, with both Islamic theologians and secular commentators condemning it, with some seeing it as a bid by Kadyrov to divide Russian Muslims into those who accept the importance he places on teachings of the Sufi brotherhoods and likely what he considers to be &quot;traditional Islam&quot; without question, and those who do not, labeled as possessing &quot;erroneous&quot; views. Many of the key participants also disavowed the resolutions. Mukkadas Bibarsov, mufti of Saratov Oblast, stated that the question of who was a true follower of Sunni Islam was resolved &quot;centuries ago&quot;. He added that the fatwa failed to take into account the crucial differences between Russia&#x27;s Muslims, specifically that some Muslim communities did not follow Sufism.

Liz Fuller, writing for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, commented that the fatwa seemed to be giving permission to Kadyrov to take any action he likes to punish those whose religious views do not coincide with his own. Yaroslav Trofimov, writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, described it as a &quot;new fracture emerging within Islam&quot;. Many Saudi clerics and citizens expressed outrage on social media at the fatwa. The Muslim Brotherhood expressed &quot;deep sorrow&quot; over the fatwa, stating that it &quot;ignited fires of discord among Muslims around the world.&quot;

=== Threats to Russian police officers ===
In 2015, Kadyrov ordered Chechen security forces to &quot;shoot to kill&quot; if they encountered police officers from other parts of Russia on the territory of the Chechen Republic. Kadyrov said: &quot;I would like to officially state: Open fire if someone from Moscow or Stavropol—it doesn&#x27;t matter where from—appears on your turf without your knowledge. We have to be reckoned with. … If you are masters of your territory, then you must control it.&quot; According to Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, &quot;Some critics claim that Mr. Putin now fears Mr. Kadyrov because he knows any serious attempt to challenge the Chechen leader&#x27;s position might lead to a third war.&quot;

===Mixed martial arts tournament involving child fighters===
A mixed martial arts tournament involving children was held as an &quot;exhibition fight&quot; on 4 October during the &quot;Grand Prix Akhmat 2016&quot; in Grozny and broadcast on Match TV. Three of Kadyrov&#x27;s sons, all of them aged under 12, fought in the tournament with Kadyrov sitting in the audience and none of the fighters wearing any protective gear. One of the fights ended with a technical knockout. Kadyrov posted images of the bouts on his Instagram account.

The event caused an outcry especially against Kadyrov allowing his children to compete in the tournament. Fedor Emelianenko, the president of Russian MMA Union, criticised the event as &quot;inexcusable&quot;, stating that rules stipulate fighters under the age of 21 have to wear protective gear while children under the age of 12 are not allowed to compete. Vadim Finkelstein, the head of MMA promotion M-1 Global backed Emelianenko&#x27;s comments.

Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for President Putin, stated that the fact that one of the fights between the children finished with a technical knockout was &quot;a reason for the appropriate oversight agencies to inquire about this incident.&quot; Deputy Minister of Sports Pavel Kolobkov stated that participation of children under the age of 12 in MMA competitions was illegal while stating that the incident was being investigated. Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also stated that the event will be investigated.

Several Chechen officials responded to Fedor&#x27;s criticism with insults and accusations including Timur Dugazayev, general director of Akhmat MMA promotion, Member of Parliament Adam Delimkhanov as well as Kadyrov himself. The Ministry of Sports found on 18 October that Kadyrov&#x27;s promotion had violated regulations. It also found that the event was actually an unlicensed show with no regulatory oversight. The promotion was directed to coordinate with the Ministry of Sports and other regulatory bodies to &quot;prevent such irregularities in conduct&quot; and handed a letter detailing its failure to comply with the legislation.

===Comments about nuclear warfare===
Kadyrov commented about Russia&#x27;s nuclear arsenal and tensions between the United States and Russia. He said that &quot;America is not really a strong enough state for us to regard it as an enemy of Russia, we have a strong government and are a nuclear state.&quot; He added, &quot;Even if our government was completely destroyed, our nuclear missiles would be automatically deployed. We will put the whole world on its knees and screw it from behind.&quot; In October 2022, Kadyrov started advocating for Russia to use low-yield nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

===Persecution of Muslims in Myanmar===
In September 2017, Kadyrov condemned the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar and organized a rally in Grozny in support of persecuted Rohingya people. Kadyrov pledged to oppose the Russian Federation&#x27;s position if it supported Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s government in Myanmar.

===Threats to citizens insulting someone&#x27;s honor===

In June 2019, Kadyrov, in an Instagram video, told the citizens of Dagestan to not insult Chechnya or Chechens online amidst a controversy over a piece of land of the republic labeled as belonging to Chechnya, threatening to torture whoever insulted the honor of Chechens. He also warned people to remove any such comments, otherwise they would have to answer to Chechen law enforcement agencies.

During a government function organized for medium and small-scale businesses in November 2019, Kadyrov called for online users insulting someone&#x27;s honor to be killed, arrested or intimidated per a BBC Russian Service translation. He stated in the same speech that he did not call for the targeting of law-abiding citizens, but of others, i.e., &quot;crooks, traitors, tattletales and schizophrenics of all stripes.&quot; Kadyrov&#x27;s spokesman, Alvi Karimov, denied the accuracy of the BBC translation; however, &quot;Meduza&quot;&#x27;s translation found it to be accurate. The speech itself was broadcast on a state-owned TV channel. Russian diplomat Dmitry Peskov stated that Kadyrov&#x27;s remarks would not be investigated by the Russian government as it was a police matter.

==== Allegations of Russian Members of Parliament attempting to commission an assassination attempt ====

On 10 October 2024, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Kadyrov accused three named members of the Russian parliament of commissioning an attempt to assassinate him. The background was said to be a conflict connected to a business merger.

==Personal life==

Kadyrov graduated with a degree in law from the Makhachkala Institute of Business and Law in 2004. In 2006, he defended his thesis at Dagestan State Technical University to obtain a Candidate of Sciences degree in economics. In 2015, he defended his thesis at Dagestan State University to obtain a Doctor of Sciences degree in economics.

Kadyrov has adopted a macho image where he frequently poses with guns and military garb, and associates with mixed martial artists. In 2022, he was pictured in military garb and $1,580 Prada Monolith boots. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; says that Kadyrov has adopted various personalities over the years: &quot;the merciless warrior in fatigues who leads special operations to kill anti-government rebels; the jolly Caucasus baron who spars with Mike Tyson and shows off his private zoo; the family man and observant Muslim who has banned alcohol, ordered that women wear headscarves in public buildings, and boasts that his six-year-old son has memorized the Koran.&quot;

Kadyrov enjoys boxing and is the owner of Fight Club Akhmat, a professional sports club that focuses on boxing and mixed martial arts.

===Family===

In 1996, Kadyrov married Medni Musaevna Kadyrova. The couple are parents of twelve children. Two sons, Adam and Eli, have earned the title of &quot;hafiz,&quot; while three daughters, Aishat, Khadizhat and Khutmat, have earned the title of &quot;hafiza&quot;.

Khutmat and another daughter, Ashura, performed together with the nasheed singer Mishary Rashid Alafasy in 2015. Khadizhat was recognised as the most gifted student in Chechnya in 2016 and qualified for participation in the pan-Russian contest &quot;Student of the Year 2016&quot; on 20 February 2016. Medni launched her &#x27;Firdaws&#x27; fashion line in March 2012 in Dubai. Aishat presented her own fashion collection in March 2017 and took over her mother&#x27;s fashion enterprise, Firdaws. She was appointed as the First Deputy Minister of Culture of the Chechen Republic in September 2020 by her father, as the Minister of Culture in October 2021 and later the Deputy Prime Minister for Social Issues in October 2023. Khadizhat was appointed as the First Deputy Head of the Administration of the Leader and Government of Chechnya
in January 2024.

Adam was appointed as the leader of his father&#x27;s security team in 2023 and was awarded the &quot;Hero of the Chechen Republic&quot; medal after a video emerged of him beating up a prisoner, which was praised by Ramzan himself, in addition to awards from other republics of the North Caucasus. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that this was a signal by Ramzan that Chechnya would continue to be controlled by his family after him. Kadyrov later appointed him as the supervisor of the special forces training school in Gudermes in April 2024. Ramzan appointed his eldest son Akhmat as the First Deputy Minister of Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Policy of the Chechen Republic in November 2023, as the Minister of Youth Affairs in February 2024, and later as the Minister of Physical Culture and Sports in May 2024. He was also appointed as the head of FC Akhmat Grozny in May 2024.

According to a 2021 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Kadyrov has a second wife, Fatima Khazuyeva. Kadyrov reportedly met Khazuyeva when she was fourteen years old at a 2006 beauty pageant. He reportedly also has a third wife, a singer and dancer named Aminat Akhmadova. A documentary and investigation by &quot;Proekt&quot; in June 2024 claimed that Fatima was the real mother of Eli and gave birth to him when she fifteen, while Kadyrov also had sexual relations with Zamira Dzhabrailova when she was fifteen and she gave birth to Adam at the age of sixteen. It also claimed that he had relations with several other minors and had a preference for underage girls who were virgins, with an assistant being responsible for procuring them for him.

As of May 2024, six out of 23 top positions in the Chechen government were held by Kadyrov&#x27;s children or their spouses, while five positions were held by distant relatives or those from his birthplace of Akhmat-Yurt. His son-in-law Ramzan Vismuradov served as a deputy prime minister without portfolio, while the First Deputy Prime Minister Isa Tumkhadzhiyev was married to a relative of his.

===Wealth===
The Russian Federation funnels money to the Kadyrov family; the distinction between the Chechen government and Kadyrov is blurred. In 2015, Chechnya received around 57 billion roubles a year from Moscow (about £550m). The family obtains money through the Akhmad Kadyrov Fund, a non-transparent foundation which describes itself as a charity and is headed by Kadyrov&#x27;s mother, Ayman. In 2011, the foundation funded Kadyrov&#x27;s lavish 35-year birthday party, which featured celebrities such as Seal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Vanessa-Mae and Hilary Swank. When journalist Marianna Maksimovskaya asked him where the money for the live-televised celebration was coming from, he reportedly laughed and said &quot;Allah gives it to us&quot;, before adding: &quot;I don&#x27;t know, it comes from somewhere.&quot; Journalists have been targeted by Kadyrov&#x27;s regime for reporting on his opulence.

Kadyrov is a noted collector of sports cars. He owns a Lamborghini Reventón, one of only 20 sold. He is also known for his extensive collection of Chechen daggers. Kadyrov has been linked to the ownership of a private jet. and he claimed to have received from Elon Musk a Cybertruck, though this is not confirmed and has been disputed by Musk himself.

Kadyrov&#x27;s family members own luxurious real estate in Moscow. Two of his wives own property valued at $8 million in total, which is more than twice Kadyrov&#x27;s declared salary since 2008.

===Health issues===
Rumors started circulating about Kadyrov&#x27;s health worsening and him being admitted to the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital in mid-September 2023, with Telegram channels operated by the Chechen opposition claiming that he had suffered a kidney failure and was in a coma. Dmitry Peskov stated that he had no information about his health. Kadyrov soon released videos to counter the rumors, insisting he was fine.

Novaya Gazeta Europe claimed in late-April 2024 that Kadyrov was diagnosed with pancreatic necrosis in 2019 and his condition had recently started worsening, causing the federal government to search for a potential successor. Kadyrov released a video hours later of him exercising in the gym. &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that despite insisting that he was in good health, Kadyrov&#x27;s public appearances showed him with a swollen face, slurred speech and keeping awake with much difficulty.

<text>The Cave Clan is a primarily Australian group dedicated to urban exploration.

==History==
The Cave Clan was founded on 26 January (Australia Day), 1986 by three Melbourne teenagers, Woody, Dougo and Sloth. The trio had started exploring together during the summer of 1985–1986. 

Originally based in Melbourne and greater Victoria, the Cave Clan expanded beyond state borders over time. The first and most notable expansion was the formation of the Sydney Cave Clan, or &quot;Sydclan,&quot; in 1991 by Michael “Predator” Carlton. While the Melbourne and Sydney Cave Clans remain the most prominent groups, there have been Cave Clan chapters in South Australia, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory, and Tasmania. The group has also included some international members, most notably Jeff &quot;Ninjalicious&quot; Chapman from Toronto, Canada.

Alfred Saddlier, a worker for the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW), is often cited as an inspiration to the Cave Clan&#x27;s founders. During construction on Melbourne&#x27;s drains in the 1940s and 1950s, Saddlier would leave his name and the date in tar paint before the last section of tunnel was put in place. After Saddlier was mentioned in an article in Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Herald Sun&quot; his sister wrote to the Cave Clan explaining that her brother was in fact a &quot;builder of drains&quot;, and not an explorer.
==Membership and activities==
Cave Clan members explore natural or artificial tunnels and caves, along with rooftops and abandoned buildings. Their most frequent activities involve exploring underground stormwater drains, bunkers, tunnels and forts. Each chapter of the Cave Clan has its favourite locations with each city, each having a different history, with therefore different types of locations to explore. For example, in Sydney, sites the Cave Clan explore include an underground ex-naval oil reservoir in Sydney.Members of the Cave Clan come from various backgrounds including tradespersons, shop owners, teachers, government workers, writers, students, scientists, and mechanics; with the Cave Clan acting as a uniting group for people who are interested in urban exploration in Australia. Amongst other things, members are attracted by the appeal of entering locations that the public rarely sees.

==Safety issues==
The Cave Clan does not advocate entering drains when it is raining, exploring alone, or removing a manhole from beneath if the above location is unknown. This is due to the potential hazard of the exit being on a road and thus has the risk of being struck by a vehicle. The golden rule of the Cave Clan is, &quot;When it rains, no drains!&quot;.

==Controversy==
As with urban exploration-related topics, by entering into locations or drains without permission, the members of the Cave Clan can be described as &quot;recreational trespassers&quot;. In 2005 it was revealed that the NSW State Government had asked for the Cave Clan&#x27;s help in finding tunnels that could become terrorist targets.

Coroner Hugh Dillon investigating the death of two graffiti artists in a Sydney stormwater drain in 2008 has recommended police investigate a group known as the Sydney Cave Clan. Delivering his findings into the deaths, Dillon said he was concerned about the counter-cultural message by the group, which he said consisted of &quot;shadowy characters&quot;.

Dillon said he would recommend to police that they investigate the group and shut the website down after it was revealed that it publicised the drain and encouraged risk-taking activity. Malinowsky, the sole survivor of the trio, alleged at the inquest that he was encouraged by a website from the so-called &quot;Cave Clan&quot;—a group which he alleged dared people to explore urban underground spaces.

==Graffiti==
The Cave Clan has long officially distanced itself from graffiti, despite the historical practice of discreet tagging as a historical documentation practice. Drain tagging is discouraged, especially in historically significant areas; there are clear examples, however, of the Cave Clan name, logo and other specific material related to the Cave Clan and/or their members, being used in graffiti, by unknown sources. The group accepts leaving details of an expedition in a plain section of the drain, tunnel or cavity to mark the place and time, and placing stickers above ground for promotional purposes.

==Related groups==
Several groups have been historically significant to or influenced by the Cave Clan. One of the earliest known groups is the &quot;Drainiacs,&quot; active during the 1960s. Information about the Drainiacs is scarce, with their existence documented solely through house paint inscriptions of their groups name and dates on tunnel walls.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, coinciding with the Cave Clan&#x27;s formation, smaller groups such as the Drain Dwellers and Tunnel Team operated in the same space. These groups were eventually absorbed into the Cave Clan, contributing to its early development.

In subsequent years, the Cave Clan has inspired the formation of other groups, including the Darksiders in South Australia and the Tunnel Toads in Victoria. These groups reflect the enduring influence of the Cave Clan on urban exploration culture.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Cave Clan&quot; is the subject and title of a song released on the Mick Thomas album &quot;Spin! Spin! Spin!&quot;. 

&quot;Cave Clan&quot; is also a song by Neatly Folded Goat
In 2016, Australian record label Superconscious Records released &quot;Cave Clan&quot; by Melbourne producer Bjorn This Way. The song was a nostalgic tribute to the producer&#x27;s experiences exploring drains and tunnels in the south eastern suburbs of Melbourne as a teenager.

Craig High School in Janesville, Wisconsin, and received his high-school diploma in 1970.

===College education===
Israel Hanukoglu received his undergraduate degree &quot;cum laude&quot; with double majors in biology and psychology and a minor in political science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He then went to the University of Wisconsin–Madison for graduate studies and received his M.Sc. degree in 1976 in an inter-disciplinary Endocrinology-Reproductive physiology program, under the joint supervision of Prof. Harry J. Karavolas (Dept. of Physiological Chemistry) and Prof. Robert W. Goy (Dept. of Psychology). His Ph.D. thesis research on the &quot;Mechanism of electron transport to cytochrome P-450 in adrenal cortex mitochondrial steroid monooxygenase systems&quot; was carried out under the supervision of Prof. Colin R. Jefcoate. He received his Ph.D. diploma in August 1980.

==Contributions to science==

Prof. Hanukoglu&#x27;s scientific work concentrated in three different areas outlined below.

===Structures of keratins===
Hanukoglu&#x27;s career in molecular biology started at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Chicago (1980–1983 with Elaine Fuchs), where he cloned and sequenced cDNAs coding for cytoskeletal proteins, actin and alpha keratins. He elucidated the first structures of cytoskeletal keratin families, and predicted the long helical domains of these proteins. By computerized analysis of amino acid sequences he predicted that the central rod domain of intermediate filament proteins is composed of four helical segments separated by three short linker sequences. Later crystallographic studies have confirmed this as a general model for intermediate filament protein structure.

===Steroid hormone synthesis===

During his Ph.D. thesis research, Israel isolated the mitochondrial enzymes that catalyze the first step in the synthesis of steroid hormones in all steroidogenic tissues, including the adrenal cortex, and the reproductive organs. The first step of steroidogenesis is dependent on the transfer of electrons from NADPH to a P450 type enzyme (P450scc) via an electron-transfer chain that includes two additional proteins. These proteins are located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Israel reconstituted this system using proteins he purified, characterized the process of electron transfer between the proteins, and built a kinetic model that simulated precisely the dynamic behavior of this complex system.

In his first academic position at the Department of Biology at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, he first determined the molar stoichiometry of the mitochondrial P450 system proteins using specific antibodies that he generated. He then set out to clone the cDNAs and the genes that code for these enzymes. His lab was the first to clone the cDNAs and the gene coding for adrenodoxin reductase - the first enzyme in the electron transfer chain of the mitochondrial P450 system.

By sequence and structural analyses of adrenodoxin reductase, Israel identified its binding sites for the electron donor and acceptor coenzymes, NADPH and FAD. By sequence analyses of the large oxidoreductase type of enzyme families, he noted that the FAD-binding site is a classical Rossmann fold, but the NADPH binding site has a different consensus sequence that could be responsible for NAD vs. NADP coenzyme specificity. The importance of the motifs he identified was confirmed by re-engineering of coenzyme specificities of different enzymes. Elucidation of the crystal structure of adrenodoxin reductase further verified Israel&#x27;s identification of the coenzyme binding sites. Analysis of the phylogeny of this enzyme in eukaryotes showed that the NADP binding site sequence is strictly conserved.

As the steroidogenic tissues have very high levels of antioxidants, Israel suspected that the P450 systems may leak electrons producing oxygen radicals. He examined this issue and showed that indeed, electrons that leak during the action mitochondrial P450 systems generate reactive oxygen species. His studies also showed that in bovine ovary, levels of antioxidants are coordinately regulated with steroidogenesis.

His other work in this field includes elucidation of the mechanism of action of corticotropin (ACTH) in regulating steroid hormone synthesis in the adrenal cortex, regulation of adrenal steroidogenic capacity in disease states, and the cloning and elucidation of the structure of ACTH receptor.

In this field, Israel organized the first International Symposium in Molecular Steroidogenesis in Jerusalem in 1991 which served as the cornerstone for a continuing series of international symposia for scientists who specialize in this field.

===Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)===

In his clinical work as an endocrinologist, Israel&#x27;s older brother, Prof. Aaron Hanukoglu (Tel Aviv University, Sackler Medical School and E. Wolfson Medical Center), identified that a hereditary disease named pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type I encompasses two independent syndromes. Following this discovery the two brothers continued their collaboration to understand the molecular basis of the severe form of PHA.

By their collaborative work that also included additional labs, the Hanukoglu brothers discovered that the severe forms of pseudohypoaldosteronism type I result from mutations in three genes (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1B) that encode for protein subunits of the Epithelial sodium (Na+) channel (ENaC). These studies also helped establish that ENaC is the principal channel involved in blood volume and blood pressure regulation in humans.

Following these studies, the Hanukoglu brothers directed their attention to understand the structure and function of ENaC assembled from normal and mutated subunits. Their analyses showed that the phenotypic variations in the severity of pseudohypoaldosteronism are associated with the types of genetic mutations. Their work on the structure of ENaC subunits led to the identification of charged residues and regions responsible for transport of the protein to membrane and for regulation of extracellular Na+ ions.

In an extensive review of studies on ASIC and ENaC, Prof. Hanukoglu has summarized the major similarities between ASIC and ENaC type channels.

To define the sites of localization of ENaC in tissues and within cells, Hanukoglu&#x27;s laboratory generated polyclonal antibodies against extracellular ENaC subunits. These antibodies for the first time permitted visualization of intracellular localization of ENaC at high resolution and led to the discovery that in all cells with motile cilia ENaC is located on cilia. These studies establish that ENaC is an important regulator of fluid level in the luminal side of cells with motile cilia in the female reproductive and respiratory tract. More recently, they showed that these sodium channels are also located in the seminiferous tubules in the testis and in the tail and head region of sperm.

Systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism patients with mutated ENaC subunits may lose significant amount salt in sweat especially at hot climates. To identify the sites of salt loss, Hanukoglu brothers examined the localization of ENaC in the human skin. In a comprehensive study examining all the layers of skin and epidermal appendages, they found a widespread distribution of ENaC in keratinocytes in the epidermal layers. Yet, in the eccrine sweat glands, ENaC was localized on the apical cell membrane exposed to the duct of these sweat glands. Based on additional observations, they concluded that the ENaC located on the eccrine gland sweat ducts is responsible for the uptake of Na+ ions from sweat secretions. This recycling of Na+ reduces the concentration of salt in perspiration and prevents the loss of salt at hot climates via perspiration.

<text>Starflam is a Belgian hip hop group from Liège in the French-speaking southern part of Belgium - Wallonia. The group started out in the early 1990s under the name &quot;H-Posse&quot; with members DJ Mig One, Fred&#x27;alabas, Seg and Balo (AKA Baloji). A few years later, after Brussels-born Akro and Mista R. joined the group, the name was changed to &quot;Malfrats Linguistiques&quot; (linguistic gangsters). Mista R. later left the group when he emigrated to France, and was replaced by Kaer and Pavé, 2 rappers from Liège. The group changed names again, now to &quot;Starflam&quot; (the reverse anagram of Malfrats). They now consist of 5 rappers, a bass player and a DJ. In 2005, Balo left the group to start a solo career.

10 years after their last album together, the group made a comeback in 2015 with 2 new single : &quot;Plus que jamais&quot; (January 2015) and &quot;A l&#x27;ancienne&quot; (April 2015).

<doc id="647895" wikidata="Q803878" url="?curid=647895" title="Baily's beads">
<text>The Baily&#x27;s beads, diamond ring or more rarely double diamond ring effects, are features of total and annular solar eclipses. Although caused by the same phenomenon, they are distinct events during these types of solar eclipses. As the Moon covers the Sun during a solar eclipse, the rugged topography of the lunar limb allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some places while not in others. They are named for Francis Baily, who explained the effects in 1836. The diamond ring effects are seen when only one or two beads are left, appearing as shining &quot;diamonds&quot; set in a bright ring around the lunar silhouette.

Lunar topography has considerable relief because of the presence of mountains, craters, valleys and other topographical features. The irregularities of the lunar limb profile (the &quot;edge&quot; of the Moon, as seen from a distance) are known accurately from observations of grazing occultations of stars. Astronomers thus have a fairly good idea which mountains and valleys will cause the beads to appear in advance of the eclipse. While Baily&#x27;s beads are seen briefly for a few seconds at the center of the eclipse path, their duration is maximized near the edges of the path of the umbra, lasting around 90 seconds.

It is not safe to view Baily&#x27;s beads or the diamond ring effect without proper eye protection because in both cases the photosphere is still visible.

Observers in the path of totality of a solar eclipse see first a gradual covering of the Sun by the lunar silhouette for just a small duration of time from around one minute to four minutes, followed by the diamond ring effect (visible without filters) as the last bit of photosphere disappears. As the burst of light from the ring fades, Baily&#x27;s beads appear as the last bits of the bright photosphere shine through valleys aligned at the edge of the Moon. As the Baily&#x27;s beads disappear behind the advancing lunar edge (the beads also reappear at the end of totality), a thin reddish edge called the chromosphere (the Greek &quot;chrōma&quot; meaning &quot;color&quot;) appears. Though the reddish hydrogen radiation is most visible to the unaided eye, the chromosphere also emits thousands of additional spectral lines.

Beaded solar eclipses occur during an eclipse when the Sun and Moon have nearly identical apparent sizes. During a beaded eclipse, the rim of the Moon displays Baily&#x27;s beads at many points all around the Moon and the brightness of the Sun remains from around 2000x to 10x greater than a complete total eclipse (ranging from about magnitude 99.8% to slightly more than 100.00%). The use of a smooth mean lunar radius to mathematically determine totality versus annularity does not take into account the deeper lunar valley floors which display the beaded photosphere points. Some authors have argued that since the Sun&#x27;s photosphere is not fully extinguished during the beaded totality of the shortest hybrid total eclipses (such as the solar eclipse of 3 October 1986), these eclipses should be classified as only annular eclipses. The diamond ring effects in the moments just before and after a beaded eclipse are often referred to as diamond tiaras. Beaded annularity or totality duration is very short - less than about 12 seconds. However, the annularity duration before and after beaded hybrid totality and beaded annularity can be longer. 

==Observational history==

Although Baily is often said to have discovered the cause of the feature which bears his name, Sir Edmond Halley made the first recorded observations of Baily&#x27;s beads during the solar eclipse of 3 May 1715. Halley described and correctly ascertained the cause of the effect in his &quot;Observations of the late Total Eclipse of the Sun [...]&quot; in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;:

The term &quot;Baily&#x27;s beads&quot; then came into use after Baily described the phenomenon to the Royal Astronomical Society in December 1836. Having observed the solar eclipse of 15 May 1836 from Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders, he reported that:

=== Double Diamond Ring Effect ===

Before the diamond ring effect during a total solar eclipse, a sequence of small bits of sunlight known as Baily&#x27;s Beads can be observed. These beads quickly disappear one by one until only one is left. By using precise elevation models of the Moon&#x27;s irregular surface, it is now possible to predict where Baily’s Beads will converge to create the double diamond ring effect instead of just one bead. A map of the path taken by this effect was created and used to determine the cities along the path of totality during the April 8th, 2024, total solar eclipse.
==In media==

In 1735, painter and architect Cosmas Damian Asam completed a painting that is probably the earliest known work that realistically depicts a total solar eclipse and diamond ring.

The Diamond Ring effect is seen during the credit opening sequence of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (1995–2001), albeit from a fictitious extrasolar body, as seen from space.

The Baily&#x27;s beads phenomenon is seen during the credit opening sequence of the NBC TV show &quot;Heroes&quot; (2006–2010).

<doc id="647896" wikidata="Q1454706" url="?curid=647896" title="Glanis">
<text>Glanis was a Gaulish god associated with a healing spring at the town of Glanum in the Alpilles mountains of Provence in southern France. There are cisterns at the site of the springs where pilgrims may have bathed. Near one of them an altar to Glanis and the Glanicae was set up. The Glanicae were a triad of local mother goddesses associated with the healing springs.

The town, where a shrine to Glanis was erected in the 4th century BC, was itself named after the god. When it became a colony of the Roman Empire, the Romans followed their usual practice by absorbing Glanis into their pantheon in the form of Valetudo. The worship of Glanis/Valetudo ended with the rise of Christianity and the destruction of Glanum in 270 AD.

<text>Edward Palmer (January 12, 1829 – April 10, 1911) was a self-taught British botanist and an Early-American archaeologist.

==Biography==
Edward Palmer was born on 12 January 1829 in Norfolk and baptised on 22 February 1829 at Brandon, Suffolk, England, the son of Robert and Mary Palmer. He emigrated to the United States in 1850, where he initially settled in Cleveland, Ohio. He travelled to South America and became a medical doctor, serving with the Union Army during the American Civil War.

Palmer collected biological specimens, primarily plants, for the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Department of Agriculture, among other institutions. According to his biographer:

He collected specimens in the southwestern United States, Florida, Mexico (including Baja California), and South America. About 200 species and two genera (&quot;Palmerella&quot; and &quot;Malperia&quot;) of plants are named in his honor. The standard author abbreviation Palmer is applied to botanical taxa he described.

Palmer&#x27;s botanical collections (numbering over 100,000) are mostly pressed and dried; they reside at research institutions around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution, Harvard University, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the U.S. National Arboretum, the New York Botanical Garden, Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, and many others. The Palmer botanical collection in the U.S. National Herbarium at the Smithsonian Institution remains the largest, containing over 16,000 specimens that Palmer collected over sixty years. He distributed two exsiccata-like specimen series, namely &quot;Algae Bahamenses&quot; and &quot;Algae Floridanae&quot;.

Palmer wrote an 1871 report, &quot;Food Products of the North American Indians&quot;, which was one of the pioneering works in ethnobotany. He collected specimens of 24 of the 61 plant species described, with their uses, in the report.

Though primarily a botanist, Edward Palmer also contributed to early American archaeology and ethnology. Between 1882 and 1884, Palmer worked as a field assistant for the Bureau of American Ethnology Mound Exploration Division. The purpose of this expedition was to conduct an extensive survey of Indian mounds in the eastern United States. While most of Palmer&#x27;s archaeological research was performed in Arkansas, he also excavated mounds in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Georgia.

While in Georgia, Palmer investigated the Kolomoki Mound site in Early County. Though he excavated many of the mounds at Kolomoki, he is said to have discovered nothing worth cataloguing. However, he examined many &quot;house sites&quot; and found a number of ash deposits and fragments of pottery. In 1894, the Mound Exploration Division final report, written by its director Cyrus Thomas, was published and dispelled racist theories that the mounds of the southeastern United States had been built by a &quot;lost race of Mound-Builders.&quot; The report cited ample evidence that the mounds were built by the ancestors of historical native tribes.

Palmer also did significant amounts of archaeological collecting and excavation in the American West, primarily in Utah, Nevada, and Texas, as well as in Mexico, including Baja California, Coahuila, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, and central Mexico. Palmer&#x27;s Baja California collections recovered from a site near Bahía de los Ángeles was subsequently described and analysed by William C. Massey and Carolyn M. Osborne.

After the Mound Exploration project was completed, Palmer returned to botany and natural history and worked as a Smithsonian field representative, a scientist at the Smithsonian&#x27;s Bureau of American Ethnology, and a collector and expert at the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., until his death on 10 April 1911.

== Family ==
Palmer married Dinah Riches (the daughter of Edmund Riches, a shepherd) at East Barsham, Norfolk, on 29 March 1856. Two months later the newly married Edward and Dinah arrived in New York aboard the ship &quot;Amazon&quot;. The marriage must have proved unsatisfactory since by April 1861 Dinah had returned to living with her parents at East Barsham.

<doc id="647904" wikidata="Q2615826" url="?curid=647904" title="Battle of Resaca">
<text>The Battle of Resaca, from May 13 to 15, 1864, formed part of the Atlanta Campaign during the American Civil War, when a Union force under William Tecumseh Sherman engaged the Confederate Army of Tennessee led by Joseph E. Johnston. The battle was fought in Gordon and Whitfield Counties, Georgia, and is generally viewed as inconclusive. 

The campaign began with Johnston holding strong defensive positions at Buzzard&#x27;s Roost Gap and Rocky Face Ridge, which he hoped Sherman would assault. He was compelled to abandon Dalton when the Union Army of the Tennessee under James B. McPherson seized the unguarded Snake Creek Gap on May 8, threatening Resaca from the west. Johnston retreated to Resaca where he was joined by reinforcements gathering there; he was pursued by Sherman, most of whose forces followed McPherson through Snake Creek Gap, while others came south down the Western and Atlantic Railroad.

On May 14, Sherman gained a foothold west of Resaca but an attack on Confederate defenses to the north and northwest was repulsed, as was an assault by Johnston on the Union left flank later the same day. On May 15, Sherman&#x27;s attack to the north and a Confederate counterattack were both stopped, but other Union forces seized a bridgehead on the south bank of the Oostanaula River. With his line of retreat threatened, Johnston abandoned Resaca that night and retreated south to Adairsville, where there was a skirmish on May 17. 

==Background==
===Union Army===


On April 30, Sherman commanded the Military Division of the Mississippi and gathered a field army numbering 110,000 soldiers of which 99,000 were available for &quot;offensive purposes&quot;. All of the Union army&#x27;s 254 guns consisted of 12-pounder Napoleons, 10-pounder Parrott rifles, 20-pounder Parrott rifles, and 3-inch Ordnance rifles. The 25,000 non-combatants accompanying the army included railroad employees and repair crews, teamsters, medical staff, and Black camp servants. Sherman directed elements of three armies. 

According to Jacob Dolson Cox, the Army of the Cumberland led by George H. Thomas mustered 60,000 troops and 130 guns, the Army of the Tennessee under James B. McPherson counted 25,000 soldiers and 96 guns, and the Army of the Ohio commanded by John Schofield numbered 14,000 men and 28 guns. 

Mark M. Boatner III credited Thomas&#x27; army with 63,000, McPherson&#x27;s army with 24,000, and Schofield&#x27;s army with 13,500. On May 1, Sherman had 88,188 infantry, 4,460 artillery, and 6,149 cavalry, or an effective strength of 98,797 men. According to Kevin W. Young, Sherman had 110,000 troops.

Thomas&#x27; army was made up of the IV Corps under Oliver Otis Howard, the XIV Corps under John M. Palmer, the XX Corps under Joseph Hooker, and three cavalry divisions led by Edward M. McCook, Kenner Garrard, and Hugh Judson Kilpatrick. McPherson&#x27;s army consisted of the XV Corps under John A. Logan and the Left Wing of the XVI Corps under Grenville M. Dodge. The XVII Corps under Francis Preston Blair Jr. would not join until June 8. Schofield&#x27;s army was made up of the XXIII Corps under Schofield and a cavalry division led by George Stoneman. The IV and XX Corps each numbered 20,000 soldiers, the XIV Corps totaled 22,000, the XV Corps had 11,500, while the XVI and XVII Corps each counted about 10,000 men.

===Confederate Army===

Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee included two infantry corps led by William J. Hardee and John Bell Hood, and a cavalry corps under Joseph Wheeler. The army was soon joined by the corps of Leonidas Polk and the cavalry division of William H. Jackson, which was sometimes called the Army of Mississippi. Hardee&#x27;s corps included the divisions of Benjamin F. Cheatham, Patrick Cleburne, William H. T. Walker, and William B. Bate. Hood&#x27;s corps comprised the divisions of Thomas C. Hindman, Carter L. Stevenson, and Alexander P. Stewart. Polk&#x27;s corps consisted of the divisions of William Wing Loring, Samuel Gibbs French, and James Cantey. 

On April 30, Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee reported 41,279 infantry, 8,436 cavalry, and 3,227 artillerymen serving 144 guns. &quot;Battles and Leaders&quot; calculated Johnston&#x27;s reinforcements as follows: Hugh W. Mercer&#x27;s brigade (2,800) from the Atlantic coast on May 2, Cantey&#x27;s division (5,300) from Mobile, Alabama on May 7, Loring&#x27;s division (5,145) from Mississippi on May 10–12, French&#x27;s detachment (550) on May 12, Jackson&#x27;s cavalry (4,477) on May 17, and French&#x27;s division (4,174) on May 19. Other units arrived at a later date. There were about 8,000 non-combatants supporting the army, many of whom were men unfit for combat. 

According to Young, Johnston had &quot;almost 70,000&quot; troops after Polk&#x27;s corps joined. The American Battlefield Trust credited Johnston with 60,000 men at Resaca.

===Strategy===

Ulysses S. Grant, the General-in-chief of the Union Army ordered Sherman, &quot;to move against Johnston&#x27;s army, to break it up, and to get into the interior of the enemy&#x27;s country as far as you can, inflicting all the damage you can against their war resources&quot;. Rather than &quot;break up&quot; the Confederate army, Sherman planned to drive it back to Atlanta. Since Atlanta was a critical Confederate railroad, supply, and manufacturing center, Sherman chose it as his objective. Sherman assumed that Grant&#x27;s operations against Robert E. Lee in the Eastern Theater would be the primary campaign and that his operations in the Western Theater would be secondary. One thing both Grant and Sherman agreed on was that Johnston must not be allowed to reinforce Lee in the east. 

Sherman&#x27;s first task was to gather enough supplies at his Chattanooga forward base to supply 100,000 soldiers and 35,000 horses for 70 days. That way, if the Confederates blocked the railroad between Nashville and Chattanooga, his Union troops would still be able to campaign. Sherman solved this problem by confiscating rolling stock from the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and two smaller railroads. By also prioritizing military use of the railroads, Sherman accumulated ample supplies by the end of April 1864. The Western and Atlantic Railroad connected Chattanooga with Atlanta and also supplied Johnston&#x27;s army at Dalton. Sherman&#x27;s 2,000-man railroad repair organization was led by William Wierman Wright.

Originally, Sherman planned to have McPherson&#x27;s army thrust across the northeast corner of Alabama in the direction of Rome, Georgia. However, he found that the XVII Corps was still at Cairo, Illinois and Andrew Jackson Smith&#x27;s two divisions also could not be used. Therefore, Sherman planned to use McPherson&#x27;s 23,000 men to execute a plan proposed by Thomas, namely to march through Snake Creek Gap and wreck the Western and Atlantic Railroad at Resaca. Then Sherman wanted McPherson to withdraw to the gap. Meanwhile, Sherman wanted the armies of Thomas and Schofield to push the Confederate army frontally. With the railroad cut, Sherman expected Johnston to retreat, whereupon McPherson would emerge from the gap again to strike Johnston from the west while Thomas and Schofield attacked from the north.

In early April, the Confederate government in Richmond, Virginia wanted Johnston to take the offensive against the Union troops opposed to him. Johnston asked for reinforcements, but Confederate President Jefferson Davis declined. Davis expected the main Union offensive to be in the east and believed that the Union army did not have the strength to mount major offensives in both east and west. When Wheeler reported with near-accuracy that Sherman had 103,000 soldiers, Davis and his military adviser Braxton Bragg refused to believe it. Bragg asserted that Sherman had no more than 70,000, including a field force of 60,000. Davis did not trust Johnston, but felt that he could not replace him on the eve of the campaign. 

===Operations===

When Jefferson Davis awoke to the danger Sherman posed to Georgia, he authorized Polk to send Loring&#x27;s division from Mississippi and an infantry brigade from Mobile. Polk exceeded his orders by ordering French&#x27;s division and Jackson&#x27;s cavalry to move from Mississippi to Georgia and by going there himself. By May 3, Sherman&#x27;s forces were in motion. On May 7, Palmer&#x27;s XIV Corps marched southeast from Ringgold to Tunnel Hill, Howard&#x27;s IV Corps marched from Catoosa Springs to support the XIV Corps, and Hooker&#x27;s XX Corps marched southeast from Lee and Gordon Mill toward Mill Creek Gap in Rocky Face Ridge. Schofield&#x27;s XXIII Corps marched southwest from Red Clay to connect with the IV Corps near Catoosa Springs. McCook&#x27;s cavalry was at Varnell&#x27;s Station on Sherman&#x27;s left flank. McPherson&#x27;s army marched south-southeast from Lee and Gordon Mill to Ship&#x27;s Gap and then east to Villanow. Garrard&#x27;s cavalry division was supposed to lead McPherson&#x27;s columns but it was delayed; Sherman ordered the offensive to begin without it. 
On May 8, in the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge, the IV Corps brigade of Charles Garrison Harker seized the northern tip of the ridge and other units moved up to Buzzard Roost Pass. At Dug Gap south, John W. Geary&#x27;s XX Corps division tried to force its way through the ridge but failed. However, these actions were designed to divert Johnston&#x27;s attention from McPherson&#x27;s force. In fact, Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry detected McPherson&#x27;s column, but Johnston was convinced that it was headed for Rome. Johnston ordered that Loring&#x27;s division march to Rome from Alabama and that William T. Martin&#x27;s cavalry division should also go there. Meanwhile, James Cantey&#x27;s brigade arrived at Resaca. At first, Johnston ordered it to march to Dalton, but reconsidered and instructed it to stay at Resaca. 
After a march on May 9, the XVI Corps division of Thomas W. Sweeny passed through the long gorge of Snake Creek Gap and reached its southern exit. The other XVI Corps division of James C. Veatch and two XV Corps divisions marched as far as the northern end of the gap that evening. The third XV Corps division was guarding the wagon train and Garrard&#x27;s cavalry was still distant. Sherman directed Kilpatrick to assist McPherson by sending a cavalry brigade. McPherson let Sherman know he was in Snake Creek Gap and issued orders to advance to Resaca the next morning. Cleburne later wrote that Johnston&#x27;s chief of staff William W. Mackall told him that the gap was undefended because of &quot;a flagrant disobedience to orders&quot;, but did not name the guilty party.

On the night of May 9, Cantey reported to Johnston that cavalry sighted Union troops near Villanow. Therefore, Johnston ordered J. Warren Grigsby&#x27;s cavalry brigade to occupy Snake Creek Gap. As Grigsby&#x27;s troopers approached the gap at mid-morning of May 10, they encountered McPherson&#x27;s advance elements, the 9th Illinois Mounted Infantry and the 66th Illinois Infantry Regiments. Grigsby immediately ordered his cavalrymen to delay the Union advance toward Resaca. By 2 pm, Dodge&#x27;s two XVI Corps divisions reached a crossroads about west of Resaca. Leaving Veatch&#x27;s division to watch the road from the north, Dodge pressed on with Sweeny&#x27;s division and routed a 1,400-man Confederate force defending Bald Hill. Cantey had only 4,000 men to defend Resaca, including Grigsby&#x27;s cavalry. 

According to William R. Scaife, the Confederate force included a brigade under Daniel H. Reynolds and two 4-gun batteries armed with 12-pounder Napoleons. Another source, Cox stated that Reynolds&#x27; brigade was at Dug Gap. 

At 4 pm, Logan&#x27;s two divisions reached the crossroads, releasing Veatch&#x27;s division. Veatch&#x27;s men crossed Camp Creek on Sweeny&#x27;s left and approached the railroad. Meanwhile, Sweeny&#x27;s division pressed forward and got within of the railroad. McPherson, worried that he was walking into a trap, recalled both of Dodge&#x27;s divisions and marched his command back to Snake Creek Gap after losing 6 killed, 30 wounded, and 16 captured. His orders were to break the railroad, but all his troops accomplished was to cut down some telegraph wire.

==Battle==
===Preliminaries===
On May 9, Thomas and Schofield sent skirmish lines to probe the Confederate defenses on Rocky Face Ridge. Johnston deployed Hardee&#x27;s corps on the left and Hood&#x27;s corps on the right. Only Harker&#x27;s brigade pressed its attack, but it was repulsed. When reports of Union forces at Snake Creek Gap reached Johnston, the Confederate commander sent the divisions of Cleburne and Walker to Tilton, north of Resaca. On May 10, Sherman learned McPherson had failed to cut the railroad and immediately sent Hooker&#x27;s XX Corps to join him at Snake Creek Gap; leaving Howard&#x27;s IV Corps in front of Rocky Face Ridge, he then followed Hooker with the rest of the army. On May 11, Polk reached Resaca with Loring&#x27;s division; next day, Palmer&#x27;s and Schofield&#x27;s corps followed, while Johnston evacuated Dalton that night and marched his troops south to Resaca.

On the afternoon of May 12, Sherman arrived at McPherson&#x27;s headquarters. The first words he said to his subordinate were, &quot;Well, Mac, you have missed the opportunity of a lifetime&quot;. Later that day, Thomas also arrived and informed Sherman that Johnston&#x27;s wagon train was sighted moving south toward Resaca, indicating that the Confederates were probably retreating. Sherman ordered the XIV Corps to hurry up and that formation hiked through Snake Creek Gap that night. Howard&#x27;s IV Corps and Stoneman&#x27;s cavalry division, which had finally arrived at the front, occupied Dalton on the morning of May 13. Howard notified Sherman at 9 am that Dalton was evacuated via a temporary telegraph line strung between his headquarters and McPherson&#x27;s. In the morning, Sherman&#x27;s forces advanced toward Resaca, getting within by 10 am. Kilpatrick led his cavalry on a reconnaissance and was wounded soon afterward. 

Logan&#x27;s XV Corps deployed with Veatch&#x27;s XVI Corps division on its right and elements of the XX Corps on it left and at 1 pm began pressing back Confederate skirmishers. By 4:30 pm, Logan&#x27;s troops drove the Confederates from Bald Hill and confronted a heavily defended line of entrenchments outside Resaca. By the evening of May 13, Sherman&#x27;s forces were aligned, from right to left, as follows: Veatch&#x27;s division, Logan&#x27;s corps, Daniel Butterfield&#x27;s XX Corps division with the other two XX Corps divisions in reserve, and Palmer&#x27;s XIV Corps. Two of Schofield&#x27;s XXIII Corps divisions were behind XIV Corps while the third division, Alvin Peterson Hovey&#x27;s, guarded Snake Creek Gap. Sweeny&#x27;s XVI Corps division was west of Resaca. Garrard&#x27;s cavalry division was near Villanow and Kilpatrick&#x27;s cavalry, temporarily led by Eli Long, watched the north bank of the Oostanaula River. 

The Union forces were confronted by the bulk of Johnston&#x27;s army. Only the divisions of Bate, Hindman, and Stewart were still marching from Dalton and reached Resaca that evening. Stoneman&#x27;s and McCook&#x27;s cavalry and Howard&#x27;s IV Corps pushed south from Dalton, slowed by Wheeler&#x27;s effective delaying tactics. Johnston deployed Polk&#x27;s corps on the Confederate left flank, facing west with its left resting on the Oostanaula. Hardee&#x27;s corps held the center also facing west. Hood&#x27;s corps defended the right flank, facing to the north with its right touching the Conasauga River. Part of Walker&#x27;s division was in reserve while the other part was at Calhoun, farther south.

===May 14===
Sherman thought that Johnston intended to retreat from Resaca, a belief strengthened by seeing the Confederate wagon train crossing to the south bank of the Oostanaula. In fact, Johnston hoped Sherman would attack him and offer the chance to deal the Union army a counterblow. Sherman ordered up his Cumberland Pontoons so that Kilpatrick&#x27;s cavalry could cross the Oostanaula and damage the railroad. He also wanted Garrard&#x27;s cavalry to cross and move toward Rome. Meanwhile, Sherman wanted the Union infantry to attack so that Johnston would be unable to stop Kilpatrick and Garrard. Thomas suggested sending McPherson&#x27;s army and Hooker&#x27;s corps across the Oostanaula to be in a position to interfere with a possible Confederate retreat. Sherman rejected that idea. The pontoons arrived on the morning of May 14 and they were at Lay&#x27;s Ferry on the Oostanaula a few hours later. During the morning, at Sherman&#x27;s behest, McPherson ordered Sweeny&#x27;s division to cross the Oostanaula and for Garrard to march to Rome. 

When Howard&#x27;s IV Corps arrived from the north at 11 am, Sherman ordered Palmer&#x27;s XIV Corps and Schofield&#x27;s XXIII Corps (on Palmer&#x27;s left) to advance. Sherman believed they were striking the Confederate right flank. In fact, the Union troops were unwittingly attacking the Confederate right-center. The Union soldiers blundered through heavy underbrush and suddenly confronted Confederate entrenchments on the east side of Camp Creek. Henry M. Judah&#x27;s XXIII Corps division recklessly charged, ran into intense rifle and cannon fire, and was bloodily repulsed. On Judah&#x27;s left, Cox&#x27;s XXIII Corps division encountered an advanced line of rifle pits and seized them after a bitter struggle. On Judah&#x27;s right, Absalom Baird&#x27;s XIV Corps division was quickly turned back by heavy fire after suffering 135 casualties. By 3 pm, Judah&#x27;s division lost 700 killed or wounded while Cox&#x27;s troops sustained losses of 66 killed and 486 wounded. Subsequently, Union artillery unlimbered and took the Confederate lines under a withering bombardment.
At 4 pm, Johnston noticed that David S. Stanley&#x27;s division of Howard&#x27;s corps had its left flank exposed and ordered Hood to attack it. At 5 pm, the divisions of Stewart and Stevenson advanced, supported by three brigades from Walker&#x27;s division and one brigade from Loring&#x27;s division. Stanley called for help, formed his division into a long thin line, and posted Peter Simonson&#x27;s 5th Indiana Battery on the extreme left flank. Howard asked for reinforcements and the division of Alpheus S. Williams from Hooker&#x27;s corps was sent. Stevenson&#x27;s soldiers overwhelmed Stanley&#x27;s two left brigades but when they tried to overrun the 5th Indiana Battery, they were driven back by deadly fire from its six M1857 12-pounder Napoleons and 3-inch Ordnance rifles. Stevenson&#x27;s division tried a second attack and was repulsed by some of Stanley&#x27;s rallied Union infantry and close-range blasts of double canister shot from the cannons. By the time the Confederates attempted a third attack, Williams&#x27; division arrived and repelled it with heavy losses. On Stevenson&#x27;s right, Stewart&#x27;s division moved too far to the right and never made contact with the Union flank.

During the afternoon, Peter Joseph Osterhaus detected weakness in the Confederate skirmish line and pushed the 12th Missouri Infantry forward. The regiment captured the bridge over Camp Creek and entrenched a position protecting the span. At 5 pm, McPherson became aware that the Confederates opposing him were sending troops to the north. Determined to stop the transfer of more troops, he ordered two XV Corps brigades to seize a hill on the other side of Camp Creek. Charles R. Woods&#x27; brigade from Osterhaus&#x27;s division and Giles Alexander Smith&#x27;s brigade from Morgan Lewis Smith&#x27;s division crossed the creek and captured the hill. At 7:30 pm, Cantey&#x27;s division and Alfred Jefferson Vaughan Jr.&#x27;s brigade tried three times to retake the hill, but failed in the face of cannon projectiles from Louis Voelker&#x27;s Battery F, 2nd Missouri and rifle fire. Because artillery placed on the hill could hit the railroad and wagon bridges, Johnston ordered a pontoon bridge to be placed out of cannon range. At Lay&#x27;s Ferry, Sweeny&#x27;s division managed a successful assault crossing of the Oostanaula. However, after receiving a report that Confederates were building a bridge upstream, Sweeny withdrew from his bridgehead.

===May 15===


On May 15, Sherman ordered Howard&#x27;s and Hooker&#x27;s corps to attack from the north and drive toward Resaca. McPherson was directed to hold his ground in the expectation that he would be attacked. Palmer&#x27;s corps was also ordered to hold its ground. Schofield was instructed to pull his corps out of line and move it to the left flank. Johnston originally planned to attack the Federal left flank again, but canceled that plan when he heard that Union forces had bridged the Oostanaula and gained a foothold in Polk&#x27;s defenses. During the morning, the only action occurred when some of Stoneman&#x27;s cavalry crossed the Conasauga and overran a Confederate hospital before being chased away. At 1 pm, Howard launched his attack and it was immediately repulsed by intense rifle and cannon fire. One general reported that his brigade suffered 120 casualties in thirty seconds before the survivors were ordered to retreat. Union brigade commander August Willich was seriously wounded in the subsequent exchange of rifle fire.
To Howard&#x27;s left, Hooker attacked with Geary&#x27;s and Butterfield&#x27;s divisions, about 12,000 men, at 1:30 pm. Each division&#x27;s three brigades formed a brigade column, that is, with the regiments formed one behind another. However, the approach march took the brigades through dense underbrush and across ravines, which mixed up the brigades and regiments. Various units of Union soldiers emerged from the rough terrain in a haphazard way and their attacks were repelled. However, William Thomas Ward&#x27;s brigade, led by Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s 70th Indiana Infantry Regiment, found itself in front of Max Van Den Corput&#x27;s Georgia Cherokee Battery and charged, overrunning the guns. Confederate counterattacks drove back Ward&#x27;s men, but John Coburn&#x27;s brigade retook the guns before also being driven back. Finally, the four 12-pounder Napoleons were left in no man&#x27;s land, with neither side able to claim the guns. Hooker&#x27;s corps gained no ground and suffered 1,200 casualties, including 156 in the 70th Indiana. 

After Johnston heard that the Federals were no longer a threat at Lay&#x27;s Ferry, he ordered Hood to attack the Union left flank again. At 4 pm, Stewart&#x27;s division launched its attack as per Hood&#x27;s instructions. Soon after, Walker reported that the Federals were across the Oostanaula at Lay&#x27;s Ferry again. Johnston tried canceling the attack, but it was too late. By happenstance, Stewart&#x27;s brigades emerged from the forest one at a time and were badly mauled by Williams&#x27; division. Williams&#x27; troops lost 48 killed and 366 wounded while inflicting 1,000 casualties on Stewart&#x27;s division. Stevenson&#x27;s division also lost at least 100 casualties in the botched attack. Hovey&#x27;s XXIII Corps division, formed of recruits, was supposed to support Williams, but instead its soldiers hugged the ground and refused to go forward. Meanwhile, at Lay&#x27;s Ferry, Sweeny learned that the Confederate bridge was a false report. So, he repeated the successful operation of the previous day and formed a bridgehead on the south bank.

That evening, after meeting with Hood and Hardee, Johnston ordered his army to retreat from Resaca. He knew Sherman&#x27;s army was fully entrenched from the Conasauga to the Oostanaula, and could potentially detach forces against his supply line. He saw that Union troops at Lay&#x27;s Ferry bridgehead were a direct threat to his army&#x27;s retreat route. Johnston directed his army to utilize the railroad and wagon bridges, plus the pontoon bridge. The four guns abandoned between the lines were the only equipment left behind. Polk&#x27;s and Hardee&#x27;s corps used the railroad and wagon bridges while Hood&#x27;s corps used the pontoon bridge. The Confederate army passed over the Oostanaula bridges by 3:30 am, detected only at 3 am when Logan&#x27;s XV Corps skirmishers found the Confederate trenches empty. Johnston&#x27;s engineers removed the pontoon bridge and set fire to the other two spans, but Logan&#x27;s men saved the wagon bridge from destruction and captured some stragglers.
==Results==
According to Castel, Union casualties at Resaca numbered 4,000 including 600 killed or mortally wounded. Confederate losses were around 3,000 of whom 500–600 men and 4 guns were captured. The American Battlefield Trust and National Park Service both listed 2,747 Union casualties and 2,800 Confederate casualties. These sources called the battle inconclusive and indecisive. Sherman forced Johnston to abandon two &quot;tactically strong defensive positions&quot;, though the Confederate army was able to escape intact both times. Castel was critical of Sherman&#x27;s handling of the battle, namely launching costly attacks, leaving his left flank open to a counterattack, failing to fire on the bridges with his artillery, and failing to utilize the Lay&#x27;s Ferry bridgehead to threaten Johnston&#x27;s retreat. Johnston also mounted costly attacks, but his retreat was &quot;well-timed and well-executed&quot;. Nevertheless, Sherman managed to push Johnston back toward Atlanta and made it impossible for Johnston to send troops to Lee. 

Sherman hoped to catch up with and crush Johnston&#x27;s retreating army between the Oostanaula and the Etowah Rivers, a distance of . It is the most open country in northern Georgia, because south of the Etowah the terrain becomes forested and mountainous again. Sherman sent Garrard&#x27;s cavalry, followed by Jefferson C. Davis&#x27; XIV Corps division, down the west bank of the Oostanaula toward Rome. McPherson&#x27;s two corps crossed at Lay&#x27;s Ferry to form Sherman&#x27; right wing. Thomas&#x27; troops were ordered to follow the railroad south. At 1 pm on May 16, Howard&#x27;s corps began crossing the repaired wagon bridge and reached Calhoun that evening. Schofield&#x27;s and Hooker&#x27;s corps marched east. They first crossed the Conasauga and then crossed the Coosawattee River at Field&#x27;s Mill before turning south to form Sherman&#x27;s left wing. Johnston retreated toward Adairsville, hoping to fight a defensive battle at that location.

==Resaca Battlefield State Historic Site==
The battlefield is preserved as the Resaca Battlefield State Historic Site and is open Fridays and weekends. The location is 183 Resaca Lafayette Rd., Resaca, GA 30735. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 1,044 acres of the Resaca battlefield as of mid-2023. The Friends of Resaca Battlefield and the Georgia Battlefields Association created a 500-acre battlefield park along Camp Creek.

==In popular culture==
Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s short story &quot;Killed at Resaca&quot; focused on a brave staff officer who was killed by recklessly riding into the line of fire.

<doc id="647905" wikidata="Q2307520" url="?curid=647905" title="Isabela, Puerto Rico">
<text>Isabela () is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the north-western region of the island, north of San Sebastián; west of Quebradillas; and east of Aguadilla and Moca. It is named in honor of Queen Isabella I of Castile. Isabela is spread over 13 barrios and Isabela Pueblo, which is the downtown area and administrative center. It is a principal part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Nicknames==
The town is known as the &quot;Jardín del Noroeste&quot; (&quot;Garden of the Northwest&quot;), because of the many wild flowers in its landscape. It is also known as &quot;El Pueblo de los Quesitos de Hoja&quot; (&quot;Town of Leaf Cheeses&quot;) for its production of a typical fresh white cheese wrapped in banana plant leaves, reputed to be the best. It is also known as la &quot;Ciudad de los Gallitos&quot; or the &quot;City of the Fighting Cocks.&quot; Since the 18th century, cock fighting was very common throughout the island, and the town became well known for the quality of its fighting cocks and special breeding and training techniques used by its people.

== History ==
The chief &quot;Mabodamaca&quot;, one of the most important chieftains of the island of Borinquen (Taíno for Puerto Rico) during the first decades of the 16th century, ruled the region of the &#x27;Guajataca&#x27; (Taíno name for the northwestern region of Puerto Rico) where Isabela was founded. Although the actual date of the origins of the first Spanish settlement is not precisely known, a small settlement/hermitage is known to have existed by the end of the 17th century or beginning of the 18th century in a great extension of land into what encompass today the municipalities of Isabela, Camuy and Quebradillas. The settlement was bordered to the east with the shoreline of the Guajataca River and was located on the grounds of an earlier Taíno settlement.

Around 1725, José Antonio de Mendizábal y Azares, Governor of the Island of Puerto Rico granted authorization to base a population on the existing hermitage/village. Its given name, San Antonio de La Tuna, derives from the avocation of the Spanish settlers to the saint Anthony of Padua and in honor of a wild cactus growing in the region (Tuna is the Spanish term for cactus). At the end of the 18th century &quot;San Antonio de la Tuna&quot; had a church, more than sixty houses, and almost 1,200 inhabitants, which was a considerable population for those times.

Prompted by economic and health factors, the decision to relocate the hermitage to a more favorable location was pursued. Around 1818, the village obtained authorization from then Governor Salvador Meléndez to transfer the population to a new location closer to the coast. Meléndez approved the transfer request and a new town was founded the following year on May 21, 1819. In the same year the construction of the church began, and was finished in 1824. In 1918 the church was damaged during a strong earthquake that affected the western region of the island, it was rebuilt soon after.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Isabela was 14,888.

On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Isabela, the hurricane caused destruction of homes and infrastructure. Maria caused structural damage to the nearby Guajataca Reservoir and thousands of people were evacuated from their homes.

== Demographics ==
In the 2010 census, there were 45,631 people in the city. This represents an increase of more than 1,000 from the 2000 census. The population density was . The 2020 census indicated the municipality had 42,943 residents, a decline of over 3,000.

== Geography ==
Isabela is a hybrid town of sorts, with the rarity of being a coastline city that has beaches but is also known for its mountains (with peaks of over above sea level), rivers (surface and submarine), lakes, caves (surface and submarine), cliffs, coastal flats and forests (including mangroves).

Geographically, the municipality of Isabela belongs to the Northern Coastal Plains and the Northern Karst region. Running through the south, the Aymamón Mountains, a prolongation of the Jaicoa Mountain Range that begins in the neighboring town of Aguadilla, boasts peaks of over above sea level. The most prominent hills that are part of these mountains are La Bandera (Galateo Alto ward) at ; La Silla (Arenales Alto ward) at ; El Sombrero (in Galateo Alto) at ; Indio (Planas ward) at ; and Monte Encantado (in Arenales Altos) at of elevation above sea level. The central part of the territory consists mostly of flatlands, the mountains do not surpass in height and the coastline flats (Bajuras) are slightly above sea level.

== Economy ==
=== Agriculture ===
The early economy of the hermitage had been based mainly on cattle [ranching], its derivative products and hogs products, but trading was limited due to many factors: its inland location and topography. The settlement was posted above a hill overlooking the river (now River &quot;Guajataca&quot;) which made it difficult to use the river as a trading route, as did the location&#x27;s propensity to disease and outbreaks.

After the transfer to the present Isabela location the economic realities that resulted from the new land and property opportunities that were readily available, the healthier environment formed due to the wide open plains and prevalent northern winds, and the proximity to the coast and the natural sea port at the bay of Punta Sardina prompted for the diversification of the agricultural products and an increase in trade. The cultivation of sugarcane, coffee, tobacco, cotton, Cassava/yuca, coconut and other fruits was stimulated further. Isabela continued to flourish until recent years due to the island&#x27;s economic crisis, the closing of important factories and the rising crime rate.

Isabela had a basketball team that played at the Jose &quot;Buga&quot; Abreu Coliseum, the Isabela Roosters (&quot;Gallitos de Isabela&quot;) Between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, the Bantams were serious championship contenders. In the late 1970s their star player, Mickey Coll, died in a motorcycle accident. The team&#x27;s first home court was named after him. The Bantams were Isabela&#x27;s home team until October 2005 when they moved the franchise to Guaynabo. 

The Playeras, a female volleyball team, played in Isabela for 2 seasons until they also moved to Aguadilla becoming Las Divas.

The Isabela Muscle Cars Club, celebrating annual events since 2002, is a popular event in Isabela. On August 28, 2016, the club celebrated their 15th Anniversary at the &quot;Coliseum Jose &quot;Buga&quot; Abreu&quot;.

The town also has its own classic car club, called &quot;Club de Autos Clasicos y Antiguos del Noroeste&quot; (Classic and Old Car Club from Northwest). They also celebrate their own Exhibition of Classic Cars at the coliseum in November.

The local basketball team was called the &quot;Gallitos&quot; (&quot;Little Cocks,&quot; in reference to the slim, lightweight body of the fighting variety) due to the town&#x27;s fame for quality fighting cocks. The name was translated literally into English as &quot;Bantams&quot;, a variety of dwarf cocks.

The town has a cockfighting arena, traditionally called a &quot;gallera&quot;. Fights were customarily held on Sunday mornings, and the bets and stakes were controlled by the government of Puerto Rico. Prizes were paid based on the fighting record of the cocks. A law prohibiting cockfighting in the U.S. and its territories went into effect in early 2019.

Isabela has amateur baseball teams. Also, Isabela is well known for its Fine Step Horses (&quot;Caballos de Paso Fino&quot;) and its world class board, wind and kite surfing spots.

==Government==

==Transportation ==
There are 5 bridges in Isabela.

==Symbols==
The has an official flag and coat of arms.

=== Flag ===

Isabela&#x27;s flag derives its design, colors and symbolism from its coat of arms. It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top and bottom stripe are yellow and the center one green. The coat of arms may be superposed on the green stripe in the center.

=== Coat of arms ===

The town&#x27;s coat of arms, dated 1819, is divided an olive tree in its center, symbolizes the first inhabitants of Isabela and of the island of Puerto Rico, the Igneris Indians. The gold represents the Taíno Indians (they made extensive use of gold), who lived in this area about two hundred years before the discovery of the island. The gold bell represented in the center stripe between two cactus is a symbol of the town of San Antonio de la Tuna. The two cocks represent the bravery of the inhabitants and Isabela&#x27;s famous fighting cocks. The horse represents the cattle wealth of the region and honors the fine step horses (Paso Fino) for which Isabela is known. The coat of arms is embellished with a mural crown having three towers, the standard emblem at the time for formally established &#x27;pueblos&#x27; (townships) under Spanish rule. The revised mural crown with five towers represents a city, but historically, only 11 communities in Puerto Rico were conferred this title when under Spanish rule.

On the occasion of the celebration of 186 years of Isabela it was necessary to adopt an ordinance to establish properly the historical veracity and heraldic elements of the emblazoned shield and official seal of the City of Isabela. The following information was drafted pursuant to Ordinance Number 3, series 2005–2006 and approved by the Municipal Legislature on August 5, 2005:

&quot;The Mural Crown: Current mural crown that has the coat of Isabela has three towers. Due to population increase of over 50,000 inhabitants who had Isabela in this last decade, the HUD office in Washington DC, conferred status as a &quot;city&quot; to Isabela last year. Given this demographic reality and focused on the mural crown that represents the spirit of unity and growth of the inhabitants of our city of Isabela, we understand appropriate that the crown mural consists of &quot;five&quot; distinct towers that symbolize the passage from town to city.&quot;

<text>Stourport Swifts Football Club are an English football team from Stourport-on-Severn, and one of the oldest non-league teams in the country. The Swifts currently play in the , and play at Walshes Meadow in the town.

==History==
Stourport Swifts was formed in 1882 and began playing competitive football shortly after. In 1931, they joined the Warwickshire League but only played in the league for two seasons before leaving the league, but were back five years later until the outbreak of World War II. When the league resumed Stourport rejoined the league. The club played in the Worcestershire League throughout the 1970s before joining the West Midlands (Regional) League Division Two in 1979–80. A fourth-placed finish in 1985–86 earned the club promotion to division one and two seasons later the club was promoted to the premier division after finishing in second place. The club finished in second place in the premier division in 1996–97 and then on 1997–98 and the second runner-up finish was enough to earn the club promotion to the Midland Alliance. Their third season in that league saw them win their first ever league championship and they were promoted into the Southern League. 2000–01 also saw the club reach the fifth round of the FA Vase. The club was placed in the West Division, finishing in eighth place in their debut season and got to the third round proper of the FA Trophy. However, the club failed to finish in the top half in subsequent seasons and were relegated back to the Midland Alliance in 2012.

<doc id="647923" wikidata="Q4247553" url="?curid=647923" title="Aleksandr V. Kuprin">
<text>Aleksandr Vasil&#x27;evich Kuprin () was a Russian painter, a founding member of the Knave of Diamonds group. Kuprin was born in Borisoglebsk (in Voronezh Oblast, Russia) in 1880 and died in Moscow in 1960. His most famous works are various landscape and still lifes.

== Early life ==
Aleksandr Kuprin, the child of a district school history and geography teacher, was born in the south of Russia in 1880, in Borisoglebsk, a busy inland port on the Vorona River. As a young man, he took evening classes at the local Society of Art Lovers, while working as a clerk on the railway. He studied in Voronezh ( 1896–1901). In 1902, he traveled to St. Petersburg to commence formal art training.

== Career ==
=== Early training ===
Kuprin studied in private ateliers for two years in St. Petersburg before moving to Moscow in 1904, where, by 1906, he was enrolled at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture as a student under Abram Arkhipov and Konstantin Korovin, the latter a noted Russian impressionist. Kuprin&#x27;s paintings of this period reflect this influence, with their loose brush strokes and emphasis on shadow and light.

In 1908, Kuprin was exposed to the new styles of French painting in the private collections of Moscow patrons. By 1910, he had dropped out of school to become one of the founding members of the Knave of Diamonds arts association (, Romanized: Bubnovyi Valet). The association&#x27;s inaugural exhibition was the explosive international height of avant-garde painting of the period, including works by French artists Henri Le Fauconnier, Wassily Kandinsky, and a new generation of paintings by young Russians impatient with old schools of thought.

=== Paul Cézanne, Cubism, and the Geometry of Form ===
Kuprin&#x27;s admiration of Cézanne was very much evident in the paintings he submitted to the 1910 &quot;Knave of Diamonds&quot; show (see illustrations, left). His characteristic works of this period combined decorative principles with keen analytical insight into the objects being depicted (&quot;Still Life With Blue Tray,&quot; 1914; &quot;Still Life With a Statuette,&quot; 1919; &quot;Autumn Bouquet,&quot; 1925—all in the Tret’iakov Gallery). These were painting questions that would dominate in his work for the next decade, although, as he continued with these themes, the geometry of his forms is gradually smoothed out.

In 1918, Kuprin took a post as professor at Svomas in St. Petersburg and also at the Vkhutemas design school in Moscow (State Higher Arts and Technical Studios), where he would continue as lecturer until 1952.

In 1925, he became a member of the Moscow Painters Association, a shift that moved him away from the earlier rebellious associations with the &quot;Knave&quot; group.

=== Soviet Influence ===
Toward the end of the 1920s, realistic tendencies became stronger in Kuprin&#x27;s work. He abandoned the approach of the Jack of Diamonds group for a more direct manner, taking up plein air painting and adopting its characteristic treatment of volume and space. This was in line with the dictates of Socialist Realism that, increasingly, had become a barrier to experimentation in Russian art. In the 1930s Kuprin started producing the industrial landscapes that are considered some of his best-known works.

This was also the period of Kuprin&#x27;s work from the Crimea, coinciding with the brief period of its autonomous rule (1921-1945). The Crimean paintings reveal &quot;the innermost harmony and dynamics of nature and its tactile quality.&quot; (&quot;The Poplars,&quot; 1927; &quot;The Beasal’skaia Valley,&quot; 1937—both in the Tret’iakov Gallery). Kuprin was an outstanding master of the industrial landscape (&quot;The Plant,&quot; 1915; &quot;Baku: The Oil Fields of Bibi-Eibat,&quot; 1931—both in the Tret’iakov Gallery).

<doc id="647932" wikidata="Q146456" url="?curid=647932" title="Mukachevo">
<text>Mukachevo (, ; , ; see name section) is a city in Zakarpattia Oblast, western Ukraine. It is situated in the valley of the Latorica River and serves as the administrative center of Mukachevo Raion. The city is a rail terminus and highway junction, and has beer, wine, tobacco, food, textile, timber, and furniture industries. During the Cold War, it was home to Mukachevo air base and a radar station.

Mukachevo lies close to the borders of four neighbouring countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. Today, the population is The city is a traditional stronghold of the Rusyn language, and the population of Mukachevo is officially reported as 77.1% ethnic Ukrainian. There are also significant minorities of: Russians (9.0%); Hungarians (8.5%); Germans (1.9%); and Roma (1.4%).

While Uzhhorod is the main administrative city in the region, Mukachevo is a historic spiritual center of the region and center of the former Eastern Orthodox eparchy of Kyivan Metropolis. In 17th century it united with Catholic church by the Union of Uzhhorod, similar to the Union of Brest. Up until World War II and the Holocaust, Mukachevo was primarily a Jewish town, and half the population was Jewish (see below), the rest of the population being Russians, Hungarians, Slovaks, and other minorities. Formerly in Czechoslovakia, and before that in Hungary, it was incorporated into Soviet Ukraine after World War II.

==Name==
Most probably, the name derives from the Hungarian surname &quot;Muncas&quot;—munkás (worker)—which later transformed into Munkács. Another version points that the name contains the proto-Slavic root word &quot;Muka&quot; meaning &quot;flour&quot;.

On 23 May 2017, the Ukrainian parliament officially renamed Mukacheve (&#x27;) into Mukachevo (&#x27;), a year after the city council had decided to rename the city. Previously, it was usually spelled in Standard Literary Ukrainian as Mukacheve while Мукачів (&quot;Mukachiv&quot;) was sometimes also used. The city&#x27;s name in Russian is (&quot;Mukachevo&quot;), as well as a name adopted by the local authorities and portrayed on the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The name of the city in other languages include:
* (&quot;Mukachovo&quot;),
* (&quot;Mukačava&quot;),
* Polish: &quot;Mukaczewo&quot;;
* Slovak and Czech: &quot;Mukačevo&quot;;
* (&quot;Munkatsh&#x27;, local pronunciation &#x27;Minkatsh&#x27;).&quot;

==History==

===Early history===
Archaeological excavation suggest that early settlements existed here before the Middle Ages. For example, a Celtic oppidum and metal works center that existed in the 3rd-1st century BC were found between the Halish and Lovachka mountains. A Thracian fort of the Iron Age (10th century BC) was found on the mountain of Tupcha. Around the 1st century the area was occupied by the Carpi people who displaced the local Celts from the area. The Slavs settled the territory in the 6th century.

===Hungarian rule===
In 895 the Hungarian tribes entered the Carpathian Basin through the Veretskyi Pass, about north of present-day Mukachevo. In 1397, the town and its surrounding was granted by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, to his distant cousin, the exiled prince of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Fyodor Koriatovych, who used to administer the Ruthenian Podolia region of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, until was exiled for disobedience by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great in 1392. Theodor therefore became a vassal of Hungary and settled many Ruthenians in the territory. Other sources, however, state that Theodor bought the town and the surrounding area in 1396. During the 15th century, the city prospered and became a prominent craft and trade center for the region. In 1445, the town became a Hungarian royal free city. It was also granted Magdeburg rights.

During the 16th century, Munkács became part of the Principality of Transylvania. The 17th century (from 1604 to 1711) was a time of continuous struggle against the expansionist intentions of the Habsburg Empire for the Principality. In 1678 the anti-Habsburg Revolt of Emeric Thököly started out from Munkács. The region also played an important role in Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence.

===Austrian control and revolts===

After the defeat of Francis II Rákóczi the city came under Austrian control in the mid-18th century as part of the Kingdom of Hungary and was made a key fortress of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1726, the Palanok Castle and the town, before 1711 owned by the Rákóczi family, was given by the Habsburgs to the Schönborn family, who were responsible for an expansion of the town. They also settled many Germans in the territory, thereby causing an economic boom of the region. During 1796–1897, the city&#x27;s castle, until then a strong fortress, became a prison. The Greek national hero Alexander Ypsilanti was imprisoned at the Palanok Castle between 1821 and 1823.

===Mukachevo during and after the wars===

In 1919, after the Rusyn Americans agreed with Tomáš Masaryk on the incorporation of Carpathian Ruthenia into Czechoslovakia, the whole of Carpathian Ruthenia was occupied by Czechoslovak troops. On 4 June 1920, Mukachevo officially became part of Czechoslovakia through the Treaty of Trianon. In November 1938, a part of the territory of the former Kingdom of Hungary was re-annexed by Hungary as part of the First Vienna Award.

Without delay the new authorities decreed the expulsion of all Jews without Hungarian citizenship. As a consequence, Polish and Russian Jews, long-term residents of the now Hungarian-controlled Transcarpathian region, and also from Mukachevo, as well as the native Jews who could not prove their citizenship, were deported over the Ukrainian border where they were turned over to the German Einsatzgruppe commando led by Friedrich Jeckeln. On 27 and 28 August 1941, they were all murdered by the Germans in Kamianets-Podilskyi&#x27;s massacre. Even so, Mukachevo&#x27;s population still held an important Jewish component, up until 1944 when all remaining Jews were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp by Adolf Eichmann.

At the end of 1944, the Red Army stormed Carpathian Ruthenia. At first the territory was given to the re-established Czechoslovakia, which then became part of the Soviet Union later in 1945 by a treaty between the two countries. The Soviet Union began a policy of expulsion of the Hungarian population. In 1945, the city was ceded to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and is currently under the sovereignty of Ukraine. Since 2002, Mukachevo has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mukachevo. The 128th Mountain Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian Ground Forces has been based in Mukachevo since World War II.

The firm benefits from provisional application on January 1, 2016 of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area provisions of the European Union–Ukraine Association Agreement.

==Jewish community==

There are documents in the Berehove (Beregszász) State Archives which indicate that Ashkenazi Jews lived in Munkács and the surrounding villages as early as the second half of the seventeenth century. The Jewish community of Munkács was an amalgam of Galician and Hungarian Hasidic Jewry, Orthodox Jews, and Zionists. The town is most noted for its Chief Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira who led the community until his death in 1937.

By 1851, Munkács supported a large yeshiva, thereby demonstrating the community&#x27;s commitment to Talmudic learning and piety.

Materially impoverished, yet wealthy in ideological debate, the Jews of interwar Munkács constituted almost half of the town&#x27;s population. The Munkács Jewish community was famous for its Hasidic activity as well as its innovations in Zionism and modern Jewish education.

The Jewish population of Munkács grew from 2,131 in 1825 to 5049 in 1891 (almost 50 percent of the total population) to 7675 in 1910 (about 44 percent). By 1921, the 10,000 Jews still made up about half the residents, though by 1930, the proportion had dropped to 43 percent, with a little over 11,000 Jews. The Jews of Munkács constituted 11 percent of the Jewry of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;.

Interwar Munkács had a very large Jewish population, which was most visible on Shabbat. On that day most stores were closed and, after services, the streets filled with Hasidic Jews in their traditional garb. The first movie house in the town was established by a Hasidic Jew, and it too closed on the Shabbat and Jewish holidays.

The Chief Rabbi of Munkács, Chaim Elazar Spira (who led the community from 1913 until his death in 1937) was the most outspoken voice of religious anti-Zionism. He had succeeded his father, Rabbi Zvi Hirsh Spira, who had earlier inherited the mantle of leadership from his father Rabbi Shlomo Spira. He was also a Hasidic rebbe with a significant number of followers. Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira was succeeded by his son-in-law, Rabbi Baruch Yehoshua Yerachmiel Rabinowicz.

Along with the dominant Munkácser hasidic community there co-existed smaller yet vibrant Hasidic groups who were followers of the rebbes Belz, of Spinka, Zidichov, and Vizhnitz. By the time of the Holocaust there were nearly 30 synagogues in town, many of which were &quot;shtibelekh&quot; (&quot;[small] house&quot; - small [Hasidic] synagogues).

The Hebrew Gymnasium (high school) was founded in Munkács five years after the first Hebrew speaking elementary school in Czechoslovakia was established there in 1920. It soon became the most prestigious Hebrew high school east of Warsaw. Zionist activism along with Hasidic pietism contributed to a community percolating with excitement, intrigue and at times internecine conflict.

In 1935, Chaim Kugel, formerly director of the Munkács gymnasium (Jewish high school) and then Jewish Party delegate to the Czechoslovak Parliament, gave a speech during a parliamentary debate: &quot;…It is completely impossible to adequately describe the poverty in the area. The Jews… are affected equally along with the rest…. I strongly wish to protest any attempt to blame the poverty of the Subcarpathian Ruthenian peasantry on the Jews&quot; (Kugel later got to Mandatory Palestine and eventually became mayor of the Israeli city of Holon).

Government policies were covertly directed against Jews, who bore a heavy share of taxes and had difficulty getting high civil service positions.

In 1939, the Hungarians seized and annexed Subcarpathian Rus—including Munkács—taking advantage of the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Though antisemitic legislation was introduced by the Hungarian authorities, Subcarpathian Rus, like the rest of Hungary, remained a relative haven for Jews until Nazi Germany occupied Hungary in 1944.

In the spring of 1944 there were nearly 15,000 Jewish residents of the town. This ended on May 30, 1944, when the city was pronounced &quot;Judenrein&quot; (free of Jews after ghettoization and a series of deportations to Auschwitz).

Today, Mukachevo is experiencing a Jewish renaissance of sorts with the establishment of a supervised kosher kitchen, a mikveh, Jewish summer camp in addition to the prayer services which take place three times daily. In July 2006, a new synagogue was dedicated on the site of a pre-war hasidic synagogue.

<text>Johann Matthäus Bechstein (11 July 1757 – 23 February 1822) was a German naturalist, forester, ornithologist, entomologist, and herpetologist. In Great Britain, he was known for his treatise on singing birds (&quot;Naturgeschichte der Stubenvögel&quot;, &quot;Natural History of Cage Birds&quot;, 1795).

==Biography==
Bechstein was born in Waltershausen in the district of Gotha in Thuringia. He studied theology for four years at the University of Jena, and spent time hunting and roaming the forests as opportunities permitted. After leaving school, he taught for some years, but gave teaching up to devote himself to outdoor pursuits. In 1795, he founded the school of forestry at Waltershausen, and in 1800, the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen made him the director of the forestry school at Dreissigacker near Meiningen in the neighbouring district of Schmalkalden-Meiningen. After the death of his own son, Bechstein adopted his nephew Ludwig Bechstein.

Bechstein was a prolific zoologist and one of the first concerned with wildlife conservation; besides his ornithological work, he also published works calling for the protection of animals that were commonly considered harmful or pests at the time, such as bats. Bechstein&#x27;s bat was named in his honour.

<text>Bojan Križaj () (born 3 January 1957) is a Slovenian former alpine skier. During his international career he competed for the then-existing Yugoslavia. He competed at three Winter Olympics. 

==Career==

Križaj, born in Kranj, was a member of a well known Tržič ski family so he started skiing at the age of 3. In the season 1976/77 he received the first World Cup point, qualified among the 15 best slalom runners and later during that season in Madonna di Campiglio he hit his first top 3 podium. On 20 January 1980 he achieved the first Yugoslav World Cup victory in Wengen, Switzerland and later he won seven more times, thus still being Yugoslavia&#x27;s and Slovenia&#x27;s most successful male alpine skier to date.

At 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, U.S., he reached the fourth place in giant slalom, missing the bronze medal by only two hundredths of a second. Four years later he took the athlete&#x27;s oath at the opening ceremony for Sarajevo&#x27;s 1984 Winter Olympics. He caused a stir when he spoke the oath not in Croatian or Serbian but in Slovene. Despite great expectations of the Yugoslav audience he finished ninth in giant slalom, much less than expected. Križaj should also have competed at 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, but he got injured a few days before the event.

His most successful World Championship was in 1982 in Schladming, Austria where he received the silver medal in slalom.

His most successful World Cup season was 1986/87 when he received the small crystal globe for the season&#x27;s best slalom runner (that was the only men&#x27;s crystal globe of that season not won by Pirmin Zurbriggen). Beside that he was the second in World Cup slalom standings in the 1979/80 and 1985/86 seasons and third in the 1980/81 season. His best position in overall World Cup standings was the 4th place in 1979/80.

He concluded his career in 1988 at the race in Saalbach, Austria where he stepped off the skis right at the end of the track and walked into the finish area. Since his skiing retirement he worked in many fields, including as importer of Austrian brand beer and adviser for ski products in Elan company. In March 2006 he became Head of Slovenian Ski Pool.

<doc id="647944" wikidata="Q1138630" url="?curid=647944" title="Craig Raine">
<text>Craig Anthony Raine, FRSL (born 3 December 1944) is an English contemporary poet. Along with Christopher Reid, he is a pioneer of Martian poetry, a movement that expresses alienation with the world, society and objects. He was a fellow of New College, Oxford, from 1991 to 2010 and is now emeritus professor. He was the editor of &quot;Areté&quot; from 1999 to 2020.

==Early life==
Raine was born in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, the son of Norman Edward and Olive Marie Raine. His father was the North of England amateur boxing champion in 1937. He then worked as a bomb armourer for the RAF, until forced to retire due to epilepsy caused by a skull fracture. After the RAF his father worked as a pub landlord. Craig Raine was raised in a prefab in Shildon, a town near Bishop Auckland. He won a scholarship to Barnard Castle School, where he lived as a boarder. Of his time there he has recalled that it seemed that everyone else&#x27;s parents seemed to be: accountants or surgeons or something. I couldn&#x27;t say my father was an ex-boxer who did faith healing, had epileptic fits and lived off a pension. So for a while I said he was a football manager. But by the end I was inviting my friends home and they thought he was just as terrific as I did.

Raine has commented on his education: &quot;At Barnard Castle I was taught by an absolutely remarkable English teacher, Arnold Snodgrass, a friend of W. H. Auden at Oxford [and later Robert Graves]. There was no question that he altered my mindset on things and made me very critical.&quot; At school he wrote &quot;&#x27;pimply Dylan Thomas&#x27; poems, some of which he sent to Philip Toynbee, then lead reviewer at &quot;The Observer&quot;&quot;.

Raine received his university education at Exeter College, University of Oxford, where he received a BA in English and later received his B.Phil.

==Career==
He taught at Oxford and followed a literary career as book editor for &quot;New Review&quot;, editor of &quot;Quarto&quot;, and poetry editor at the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. He became poetry editor at publishers Faber and Faber in 1981, and has been a fellow of New College, Oxford, since 1991, retiring from his post as tutor in June 2010.

In 1972 he married Ann Pasternak Slater, a now retired fellow of St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford. They have one daughter and three sons. Moses Raine is a playwright and Nina Raine a director and playwright.

Craig Raine is founder and editor of the literary magazine &quot;Areté&quot; and a frequent contributor. His works include a number of poetry collections: &quot;The Onion, Memory&quot; (1978), &quot;A Martian Sends a Postcard Home&quot; (1979), &quot;A Free Translation&quot; (1981), &quot;Rich&quot; (1984), &quot;History: The Home Movie&quot; (1994), and &quot;Clay. Whereabouts Unknown&quot; (1996). His reviews and essays are collected in two anthologies: &quot;Haydn and the Valve Trumpet&quot; (1990) and &quot;In Defence of T. S. Eliot&quot; (2000). A short critical-biographical study of Eliot, &quot;T. S. Eliot: Image, Text and Context&quot;, was published in 2007.

His friend Ian McEwan argues that Raine espouses &quot;very strong and clear, almost Arnoldian, ideas of literature and criticism&quot;.

<doc id="647946" wikidata="Q1251189" url="?curid=647946" title="Elspeth Howe">
<text>Elspeth Rosamund Morton Howe, Baroness Howe of Idlicote, Lady Howe of Aberavon,&lt;ref name=&quot;3610/career&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;née&quot; Shand; 8 February 1932 – 22 March 2022) was a British life peer and crossbench member of the House of Lords (2001–2020) who served in many capacities in public life. As the widow of Geoffrey Howe, she was formerly known as Lady Howe of Aberavon before receiving a peerage in her own right. She was the paternal half-aunt of Queen Camilla.

==Early life==
Born Elspeth R. M. Shand in Marylebone, London, she was the daughter of the writer Philip Morton Shand by his fourth wife, Sybil Mary Shand (née Sissons, formerly Slee). As such, she was a half-aunt to Queen Camilla (née Shand, formerly Parker Bowles), whose father, Bruce Shand, was son of Philip Morton Shand by a previous marriage. She grew up in Bath, Somerset, and was educated at Wycombe Abbey, a private school for girls, and at the London School of Economics. She married the rising politician Geoffrey Howe in 1953, and had three children.

==Career==
Howe was deputy chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission from 1975 to 1979, and worked in other capacities from 1980. She was later chair of the Broadcasting Standards Commission. In the 1999 New Year Honours she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Lady Howe was a Justice of the Peace in Inner London from 1964 until her retirement from the Bench in 2002. She sat in the Youth Court at Camberwell where she was a bench chairman.

On 29 June 2001, at the age of 69, she was made a life peer, as Baroness Howe of Idlicote, of Shipston-on-Stour in the County of Warwickshire, in her own right, becoming one of the first People&#x27;s Peers. She and her husband were one of the few couples each of whom held a peerage in their own right. Having already been styled Lady Howe by dint of her husband&#x27;s knighthood and then his peerage, it was quipped when she received her own peerage that she was &quot;once, twice, three times a Lady&quot;.

Howe retired from Parliament on 2 June 2020. She died at her home in Idlicote, Warwickshire, on 22 March 2022, aged 90, having had cancer.

<text>Antonio Damasio () is a Portuguese neuroscientist. He is currently the David Dornsife Chair in Neuroscience, as well as Professor of Psychology, Philosophy, and Neurology, at the University of Southern California, and, additionally, an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute. He was previously the chair of neurology at the University of Iowa for 20 years. Damasio heads the Brain and Creativity Institute, and has authored several books: his work, &quot;Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain&quot; (2010), explores the relationship between the brain and consciousness. Damasio&#x27;s research in neuroscience has shown that emotions play a central role in social cognition and decision-making.

== Life and work ==

During the 1960s, &quot;Damasio studied medicine at the University of Lisbon Medical School, where he also did his neurological residency and completed his doctorate in 1974.&quot; &quot;For part of his studies, he researched behavioral neurology under the supervision of Norman Geschwind of the Aphasia Research Center in Boston.&quot;

Damasio&#x27;s main field is neurobiology, especially the neural systems which underlie emotion, decision-making, memory, language and consciousness.
Damasio formulated the somatic marker hypothesis, a theory about how emotions and their biological underpinnings are involved in decision-making (both positively and negatively, and often non-consciously). Emotions provide the scaffolding for the construction of social cognition and are required for the self processes which undergird consciousness. &quot;Damasio provides a contemporary scientific validation of the linkage between feelings and the body by highlighting the connection between mind and nerve cells ... this personalized embodiment of mind.&quot;

The somatic marker hypothesis has inspired many neuroscience experiments carried out in laboratories in the U.S. and Europe, and has had a major impact in contemporary science and philosophy. Damasio has been named by the Institute for Scientific Information as one of the most highly cited researchers in the past decade. Current work on the biology of moral decisions, neuro-economics, social communication, and drug-addiction, has been strongly influenced by Damasio&#x27;s hypothesis. An article published in the Archives of Scientific Psychology in 2014 named Damasio one of the 100 most eminent psychologist of the modern era. (Diener et al. &quot;Archives of Scientific Psychology&quot;, 2014, 2, 20–32). The June–July issue of &quot;Sciences Humaines&quot; included Damasio in its list of 50 key thinkers in the human sciences of the past two centuries.

Damasio also proposed that emotions are part of homeostatic regulation and are rooted in reward/punishment mechanisms. He recovered William James&#x27; perspective on feelings as a read-out of body states, but expanded it with an &quot;as-if-body-loop&quot; device which allows for the substrate of feelings to be simulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation process later uncovered by mirror neurons). He demonstrated experimentally that the insular cortex is a critical platform for feelings, a finding that has been widely replicated, and he uncovered cortical and induction sites for human emotions, e.g. in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. He also demonstrated that while the insular cortex plays a major role in feelings, it is not necessary for feelings to occur, suggesting that brain stem structures play a basic role in the feeling process.

He has continued to investigate the neural basis of feelings and demonstrated that although the insular cortex is a major substrate for this process it is not exclusive, suggesting that brain stem nuclei are critical platforms as well. He regards feelings as the necessary foundation of sentience.

In another development, Damasio proposed that the cortical architecture on which learning and recall depend involves multiple, hierarchically organized loops of axonal projections that converge on certain nodes out of which projections diverge to the points of origin of convergence (the convergence-divergence zones). This architecture is applicable to the understanding of memory processes and of aspects of consciousness related to the access of mental contents.

In &quot;The Feeling of What Happens&quot;, Damasio laid the foundations of the &quot;enchainment of precedences&quot;: &quot;the nonconscious neural signaling of an individual organism begets the protoself which permits core self and core consciousness, which allow for an autobiographical self, which permits extended consciousness. At the end of the chain, extended consciousness permits conscience.

According to the University of Iowa&#x27;s Department of Neurology&#x27;s website, &quot;Damasio&#x27;s research depended significantly on establishing the modern human lesion method, an enterprise made possible by Hanna Damasio&#x27;s structural neuroimaging/neuroanatomy work complemented by experimental neuroanatomy (with Gary Van Hoesen and Josef Parvizi), experimental neuropsychology (with Antoine Bechara, Ralph Adolphs, and Dan Tranel) and functional neuroimaging (with Kaspar Meyer, Jonas Kaplan, and Mary Helen Immordino-Yang).&quot; The experimental neuroanatomy work with Van Hoesen and Bradley Hyman led to the discovery of the disconnection of the hippocampus caused by neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex of patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

As a clinician, he and his collaborators have studied and treated disorders of behaviour and cognition, and movement disorders.

Damasio&#x27;s books deal with the relationship between emotions and their brain substrates. His 1994 book, &quot;Descartes&#x27; Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain&quot;, won the Science et Vie prize, was a finalist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Award, and is translated in over 30 languages. It is regarded as one of the most influential books of the past two decades. His second book, &quot;The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness&quot;, was named as one of the ten best books of 2001 by the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, a &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; Best Book of the Year, a &quot;Library Journal&quot; Best Book of the Year, and has over 30 foreign editions. On the basis of a single-case experiment, Damasio suggested emotions belong to the automatic vital processes of the body and thus can be recognized by a person without any form of memory.
In 2003, this work was followed by the publication of &quot;Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain&quot;. In it, Damasio suggested that the philosopher Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s thinking foreshadowed discoveries in biology and neuroscience views on the mind-body problem and that Spinoza was a protobiologist. Damasio&#x27;s book is &quot;Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain&quot;. In it Damasio suggests that the self is the key to conscious minds and that feelings, from the kind he designates as primordial to the well-known feelings of emotion, are the basic elements in the construction of the protoself and core self. The book received the Corinne International Book Prize.
Damasio is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. He is the recipient of several prizes, amongst them the Grawemeyer Award, the Honda Prize, the Prince of Asturias Award in Science and Technology and the Beaumont Medal from the American Medical Association, as well as honorary degrees from, most recently, the Sorbonne (Université Paris Descartes), shared with his wife Hanna Damasio. He has also received doctorates from the Universities of Aachen, Copenhagen, Leiden, Barcelona, Coimbra, Leuven and numerous others.

In 2013, the Escola Secundária António Damásio was dedicated in Lisbon.

He says he writes in the belief that &quot;scientific knowledge can be a pillar to help humans endure and prevail.&quot;

He is married to Hanna Damasio, a prominent neuroscientist and frequent collaborator and co-author, who is a professor of neuroscience at the University of Southern California and the director of the Dornsife Neuroimaging Center.

In 2017, he was designated member of the Council of State of Portugal, replacing Antonio Guterres, the 9th Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Damasio additionally serves on the board of directors of the Berggruen Institute, and sits on the jury for the Berggruen Prize for Philosophy.

<doc id="647965" wikidata="Q2116787" url="?curid=647965" title="Big Brovaz">
<text>Big Brovaz (pronounced as &quot;brothers&quot;) is an R&amp;B and hip hop music group from London, England. In their seven-year career they released two studio albums and eight singles. There were three line-up changes with two of the original members leaving halfway through. In 2006, the only two female members launched their own band Booty Luv, which was taking off following the success of their debut single &quot;Boogie 2nite&quot;. After their second album failed to chart and with low sales of their last two singles, the band decided to split. In May 2012, the four members from the third line-up reformed and toured Australia with S Club 3.

==History==
===2001–2002: Formation, original lineup and &quot;Look Inside&quot;===
Big Brovaz originally comprised three women (Cherise, who won the MOBO for best unsigned artist in 2000; Dion; and Nadia, born in Reading), three men (J-Rock; Flawless, born in Lagos; and Randy), plus two producers Skillz (also known as JJC, born in Kano, who also managed his group 419 Squad), and Michael Fingaz Mugisha. The group was referred to as a softer version of the So Solid Crew.

The group was brought together by Fingaz, one of the collective&#x27;s producers, who already worked under the title &quot;Big Brovaz&quot;. The &quot;Big Brovaz&quot; team asked the individual members to showcase their talent alongside underground London R&amp;B and hip hop artists on a compilation that was being put together, entitled &quot;Big Brovaz – Watching You&quot;. On the album, rather than giving each member an individual track, the producers decided to make the artists work together and perform on the same tracks. That collaborative effort led to the group&#x27;s formation.

The &quot;Big Brovaz – Watching You&quot; compilation sold over two thousand copies.

A track from the album, which featured west London R&amp;B singer Cherise, was picked up by the organizer of the annual MOBO award and she was asked to compete in the annual MOBO Unsigned talent competition where she achieved first place. Cherise was signed and later release her own solo album. Following this, the group was picked up by Sony Records.

Female member Cherise released a solo album &quot;Look Inside&quot; before the debut album from Big Brovaz was released. It only spawned one single, &quot;2nd Best&quot;, while the album won a MOBO award.

===2002–2004: Commercial breakthrough and &quot;Nu Flow&quot;===
The group&#x27;s breakthrough was in October 2002 when the group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Nu Flow&quot; became a hit, particularly in the UK where it made the top 3, spending over four months inside the top 75. Their debut album of the same name was released on 4 November 2002 to rave reviews. This single was covered in 2006 in a UK Halifax TV advertisement.

The group&#x27;s success continued into 2003 with the release of further singles from their debut album. The group&#x27;s second single, &quot;OK&quot; made Number 7 in the UK Singles Chart prompting a re-release of the album with a re-ordered track listing and new tracks on 10 February 2003. However, the album was re-issued yet again one month later, on 24 March 2003, with another re-ordered track listing and a new track entitled &quot;Favourite Things&quot;. This song became the group&#x27;s third single and was famous for sampling the song &quot;My Favourite Things&quot; from the musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. As well as their own interpretation of the classic song, the group decided to include a cover of the original as a hidden bonus track on version three of &quot;Nu Flow&quot;. &quot;Favourite Things&quot; became the group&#x27;s biggest highest-charting hit to date, peaking at Number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and spending three weeks inside the top 3 of that chart.

The fourth single taken from the album was &quot;Baby Boy&quot;. The music video for the single was famous for being inspired by the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. &quot;Baby Boy&quot; became the group&#x27;s fourth top 10 hit in a row, peaking at Number 4 in the UK singles chart. The fifth single from the album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t What You Do&quot;, which sampled Fun Boy Three and Bananarama&#x27;s collaboration &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s the Way That You Do It)&quot; was the group&#x27;s fifth top 15 hit, peaking at Number 15.

The group&#x27;s debut album was certified platinum in the UK, a great achievement for UK R&amp;B and hip hop.

The group next appeared on-screen in the 2004 film &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, in which they performed a version of Sly &amp; the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; and was featured on the Soundtrack. They also released the single &quot;We Wanna Thank You (The Things You Do)&quot; as the theme song from the movie in April 2004. This was the collective&#x27;s smallest hit to date, peaking at Number 17 in the UK singles charts. Shortly after this, rapper Flawless was stopped at LAX airport and was found to be in possession of about of Cannabis out of the UK. This resulted in his sacking from the group in 2004, leaving the remaining 5 group members and two producers to carry on without him.

===2004–2007: third line up, &quot;Re Entry&quot; and split===

Later in 2004, one member down, the group released another new single, &quot;Yours Fatally&quot;, which was due to be taken from their second album. Although receiving good reviews, the single did not catch on as much as their record company had hoped and were subsequently dropped by their label due to poor sales in late 2004. After being dropped, the group decided to split up and pursue solo ventures. The reformed group&#x27;s MySpace webpage confirmed that a new single would be released 24 April entitled &quot;Hangin&#x27; Around&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s lowest charting hit to date, peaking outside the UK top 40.

Despite this setback, the group continued and they announced that their second album &quot;Re-Entry&quot; (originally due for a May release) would finally be released in early 2007. The third single from the album (as &quot;Yours Fatally&quot; was to be included), confirmed as &quot;Big Bro Thang&quot;, was announced to have a release before the album. The single &quot;Big Bro Thang&quot; was released with six remixes launching on iTunes between 26 February 2007 and 19 March, with the album &quot;Re-Entry&quot; finally released on 9 April 2007.

===2012-present: Reformation, touring and new material===
In May 2012, the four remaining original members of the band set off on a tour of Australia with three members of pop group S Club 7. On 14 September 2014 the group released their first single since reforming independently. In October and December 2018, the band joined with Peter Andre, 5ive, S Club 3, Boyzlife (Keith Duffy and Shane Lynch), B*Witched, Blazin&#x27; Squad and East 17, for a 5-date revival arena tour. Cherise and Nadia also performed as Booty Luv.

On 25 September 2021 the group released &quot;Controlla&quot;. This was the first release by the group that did not feature vocals from the female members of the band.

==Solo careers==

Nadia and Cherise are now also performing under the name Booty Luv. Their first single, a cover of Tweet&#x27;s &quot;Boogie 2nite&quot; was released in the UK via the Hed Kandi label on 27 November 2006. The single received good reviews and became a favourite on the UK club scene. It peaked at Number 2 in its third week in the UK Singles Chart, spending eleven weeks in the Top 15 and sixteen weeks in the Top 40.

Four more singles have since been released, with &quot;Shine&quot;, a cover of the Luther Vandross song, peaking at Number 10 in the UK singles chart. Third and fourth singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with My Man&quot;, a cover of the Lucy Pearl song, and an original song &quot;Some Kinda Rush&quot; both reached the Top 20, peaking at number 11 and 19. &quot;Dance Dance&quot; was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Booty Luv&#x27;s début album &quot;Boogie 2nite&quot; was released on 17 September 2007, and reached number 11 in the UK Albums Chart.

J-Rock and Randy also went on to form their own group, Party Dark, falling into the Party/House and Rap genres and were signed to Champion Records in 2009. On 15 March 2010 they released their first single, &quot;Is That You?&quot;, which was well received by DJs such as Huw Stephens, Bobby Friction and Eddie Temple-Morris and the music video reached Number 1 in the MTV Dancefloor Charts four weeks in a row.

Party Dark released a second single in the later part of 2010 called &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;. This was announced via a teaser trailer on YouTube and a remix competition on their own and their label&#x27;s websites.

J-Rock was the protagonist of an All 4 documentary entitled &quot;Giving Up the Weed&quot;.

<doc id="647967" wikidata="Q297302" url="?curid=647967" title="William Bateson">
<text>William Bateson (8 August 1861 – 8 February 1926) was an English biologist who was the first person to use the term genetics to describe the study of heredity, and the chief populariser of the ideas of Gregor Mendel following their rediscovery in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns. His 1894 book &quot;Materials for the Study of Variation&quot; was one of the earliest formulations of the new approach to genetics.

==Early life and education ==
Bateson was born 1861 in Whitby on the Yorkshire coast, the son of William Henry Bateson, Master of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and Anna Bateson (née Aikin), who was on the first governing body of Newnham College, Cambridge. He was educated at Rugby School and at St John&#x27;s College, where he graduated BA in 1883 with a first in natural sciences.

Taking up embryology, he went to the United States to investigate the development of &quot;Balanoglossus&quot;, a worm-like hemichordate which led to his interest in vertebrate origins. In 1883–4 he worked in the laboratory of William Keith Brooks, at the Chesapeake Zoölogical Laboratory in Hampton, Virginia. 
Turning from morphology to study evolution and its methods, he returned to England and became a Fellow of St John&#x27;s. Studying variation and heredity, he travelled in western Central Asia.

==Career==
Between 1900 and 1910 Bateson directed a rather informal &quot;school&quot; of genetics at Cambridge. His group consisted mostly of women associated with Newnham College, Cambridge, and included both his wife Beatrice, and her sister Florence Durham. They provided assistance for his research program at a time when Mendelism was not yet recognised as a legitimate field of study. The women, such as Muriel Wheldale (later Onslow), carried out a series of breeding experiments in various plant and animal species between 1902 and 1910. The results both supported and extended Mendel&#x27;s laws of heredity. Hilda Blanche Killby, who had finished her studies with the Newnham College Mendelians in 1901, aided Bateson in the replication of Mendel&#x27;s crosses in peas. She conducted independent breeding experiments in rabbits and bantam fowl, as well.

In 1910, Bateson became director of the John Innes Horticultural Institution and moved with his family to Merton Park in Surrey. During his time at the John Innes Horticultural Institution he became interested in the chromosome theory of heredity and promoted the study of cytology by the appointment of W.C.F. Newton and, in 1923, Cyril Dean Darlington.

In 1919, he founded The Genetics Society, one of the first learned societies dedicated to Genetics.

==Personal life==
Bateson was married to Beatrice Durham. He first became engaged to her in 1889, but at the engagement party, was thought to have had too much wine, so his mother in law prevented her daughters&#x27; engagement. They finally married 7 years later in June 1896, by which time Arthur Durham had died and his wife had either died (according to Henig) or had somehow been persuaded to drop her opposition to the marriage (according to Cock). Their son was the anthropologist and cyberneticist Gregory Bateson.

Bateson has been described as a &quot;very militant&quot; atheist.

==Awards==
In June 1894 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and won their Darwin Medal in 1904 and their Royal Medal in 1920. He also delivered their Croonian lecture in 1920. 
He was the president of the British Association in 1913–1914.

== Work on biological variation (to 1900) ==
Bateson&#x27;s work published before 1900 systematically studied the structural variation displayed by living organisms and the light this might shed on the mechanism of biological evolution, and was strongly influenced by both Charles Darwin&#x27;s approach to the collection of comprehensive examples, and Francis Galton&#x27;s quantitative (&quot;biometric&quot;) methods. In his first significant contribution, he shows that some biological characteristics (such as the length of forceps in earwigs) are not distributed continuously, with a normal distribution, but discontinuously (or &quot;dimorphically&quot;). He saw the persistence of two forms in one population as a challenge to the then current conceptions of the mechanism of heredity, and says &quot;The question may be asked, does the dimorphism of which cases have now been given represent the beginning of a division into two species?&quot;

In his 1894 book, &quot;Materials for the study of variation&quot;, Bateson took this survey of biological variation significantly further. He was concerned to show that biological variation exists both continuously, for some characters, and discontinuously for others, and coined the terms &quot;meristic&quot; and &quot;substantive&quot; for the two types. In common with Darwin, he felt that quantitative characters could not easily be &quot;perfected&quot; by the selective force of evolution, because of the perceived problem of the &quot;swamping effect of intercrossing&quot;, but proposed that discontinuously varying characters could.

In &quot;Materials&quot; Bateson noted and named homeotic mutations, in which an expected body-part has been replaced by another. The animal mutations he studied included bees with legs instead of antennae; crayfish with extra oviducts; and in humans, polydactyly, extra ribs, and males with extra nipples. These mutations are in the homeobox genes which control the pattern of body formation during early embryonic development of animals. The 1995 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded for work on these genes. They are thought to be especially important to the basic development of all animals. These genes have a crucial function in many, and perhaps all, animals.

In &quot;Materials&quot; unaware of Gregor Mendel&#x27;s results, Bateson wrote concerning the mechanism of biological heredity, &quot;The only way in which we may hope to get at the truth is by the organization of systematic experiments in breeding, a class of research that calls perhaps for more patience and more resources than any other form of biological enquiry. Sooner or later such an investigation will be undertaken and then we shall begin to know.&quot; Mendel had cultivated and tested some 28,000 plants, performing exactly the experiment Bateson wanted.

Also in &quot;Materials&quot;, he stated what has been called Bateson&#x27;s rule, namely that extra legs are mirror-symmetric with their neighbours, such as when an extra leg appears in an insect&#x27;s leg socket. It appears to be caused by the leaking of positional signals across the limb-limb interface, so that the extra limb&#x27;s polarity is reversed.

In 1897 he reported some significant conceptual and methodological advances in his study of variation. &quot;I have argued that variations of a discontinuous nature may play a prepondering part in the constitution of a new species.&quot; He attempts to silence his critics (the &quot;biometricians&quot;) who misconstrue his definition of discontinuity of variation by clarification of his terms: &quot;a variation is discontinuous if, when all the individuals of a population are breeding freely together, there is not simple regression to one mean form, but a sensible preponderance of the variety over the intermediates… The essential feature of a discontinuous variation is therefore that, be the cause what it may, there is not complete blending between variety and type. The variety persists and is not &quot;swamped by intercrossing&quot;. But critically, he begins to report a series of breeding experiments, conducted by Edith Saunders, using the alpine brassica &quot;Biscutella laevigata&quot; in the Cambridge botanic gardens. In the wild, hairy and smooth forms of otherwise identical plants are seen together. They intercrossed the forms experimentally, &quot;When therefore the well-grown mongrel plants are examined, they present just the same appearance of discontinuity which the wild plants at the Tosa Falls do. This discontinuity is, therefore, the outward sign of the fact that in heredity the two characters of smoothness and hairiness do not completely blend, and the offspring do not regress to one mean form, but to two distinct forms.&quot;

At about this time, Hugo de Vries and Carl Erich Correns began similar plant-breeding experiments. But, unlike Bateson, they were familiar with the extensive plant breeding experiments of Gregor Mendel in the 1860s, and they did not cite Bateson&#x27;s work. Critically, Bateson gave a lecture to the Royal Horticultural Society in July 1899, which was attended by Hugo de Vries, in which he described his investigations into discontinuous variation, his experimental crosses, and the significance of such studies for the understanding of heredity. He urged his colleagues to conduct large-scale, well-designed and statistically analysed experiments of the sort that, although he did not know it, Mendel had already conducted, and which would be &quot;rediscovered&quot; by de Vries and Correns just six months later.

== Founding the discipline of genetics ==
Bateson became famous as the outspoken Mendelian antagonist of Walter Raphael Weldon, his former teacher, and of Karl Pearson who led the biometric school of thinking. The debate centred on saltationism versus gradualism (Darwin had represented gradualism, but Bateson was a saltationist). Later, Ronald Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane showed that discrete mutations were compatible with gradual evolution, helping to bring about the modern evolutionary synthesis.

Bateson first suggested using the word &quot;genetics&quot; (from the Greek gennō, &quot;γεννώ&quot;; &quot;to give birth&quot;) to describe the study of inheritance and the science of variation in a personal letter to Adam Sedgwick (1854–1913, zoologist at Cambridge, not the Adam Sedgwick (1785–1873) who had been Darwin&#x27;s professor), dated 18 April 1905. Bateson first used the term &quot;genetics&quot; publicly at the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in 1906. Although this was three years before Wilhelm Johannsen used the word &quot;gene&quot; to describe the units of hereditary information, De Vries had introduced the word &quot;pangene&quot; for the same concept already in 1889, and etymologically the word &quot;genetics&quot; has parallels with Darwin&#x27;s concept of pangenesis. Bateson and Edith Saunders also coined the word &quot;allelomorph&quot; (&quot;other form&quot;), which was later shortened to allele.

Bateson co-discovered genetic linkage with Reginald Punnett and Edith Saunders, and he and Punnett founded the &quot;Journal of Genetics&quot; in 1910. Bateson also coined the term &quot;epistasis&quot; to describe the genetic interaction of two independent loci. His interpretations and philosophies were often at odds with Galtonian eugenics, and he was a pivotal figure in shifting the consensus away from strict hereditarianism.

The John Innes Centre holds a Bateson Lecture in his honour at the annual John Innes Symposium.

<text>Dennis Howard Marks (13 August 1945 – 10 April 2016) was a Welsh drug smuggler and author who achieved notoriety as an international cannabis smuggler through high-profile court cases.

At his peak he claimed to have been smuggling consignments of the drug as large as 30 tons, and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually charged by the US Drug Enforcement Administration, convicted and given a 25-year prison sentence; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 aliases, he became known as &quot;Mr Nice&quot; after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice. After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, &quot;Mr. Nice&quot; (1996), and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation.

==Early life and education==
Marks was born in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, Wales, the son of Dennis Marks, a captain in the Merchant Navy, and Edna, a teacher. Brought up as a Baptist, he later turned to Buddhism, though he did not become a devout follower. He attended Garw Grammar School in Pontycymer. He was a fluent Welsh speaker.

He gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, after he impressed Russell Meiggs in his interview, and read physics there from 1964 to 1967. At the university he was first introduced to cannabis by Denys Irving. After his friend Joshua Macmillan (son of Maurice Macmillan) died, Marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs. Among his other friends at Oxford were the epidemiologist Julian Peto and the journalist Lynn Barber. Through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming, he passed his finals; this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams.

In 1967 he began teacher training, and married Ilze Kadegis, a Latvian student at St. Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, who was also training to become a teacher. He gave up teacher training to continue his education at the University of London (1967–68; Grad. Inst P.), then back to Balliol College, Oxford (1968–69; Dip HPh Sc), and then on to the University of Sussex (1969–70) to study philosophy of science.

Marks&#x27;s daughter, Amber Marks, is a barrister and pharmacology expert.

==Drug empire==
Though involved with drugs at university, he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until 1970, when he was persuaded to assist Graham Plinston, who had been arrested in Germany on drug trafficking charges. Through Plinston he met Mohammed Durrani, a Pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the Durranis who had run Afghanistan in the 19th century. With Plinston behind bars, Durrani offered Marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in London, and he agreed to the proposition. He formed a four-way partnership with Charlie Radcliffe, Charlie Weatherly and a dealer named Jarvis. Durrani never contacted them, and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug in Oxford, Brighton and London. After six months he returned to Germany to help bail Plinston out of jail. Marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record.

Now a free man, Plinston gave Marks a job transporting hashish in Frankfurt; Marks in turn hired a New Zealand smuggler named Lang as his driver. After paying Marks £5,000 for his work in Frankfurt, Plinston then sold hashish to Marks and his three friends (Radcliffe, Weatherly and Jarvis) in London; in selling within a week, the four men made a profit of £20,000. Durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of Pakistani diplomats who were moving to London; Marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £7,500. Marks expanded his enterprise, employing two friends from Wales, Mike Bell and David Thomas, to stash the drugs and help with transportation. The gang became dissatisfied with the way the profits were being split (80% of the money they made went to Durrani) and contacted James McCann, a gunrunner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Marks and Plinston persuaded McCann to smuggle hashish into Ireland from Kabul, which the pair would then ferry over to Wales and into England; McCann would get the drugs into Ireland through the freeport at Shannon Airport using his IRA connections. Marks avoided the attention of HM Revenue and Customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses.

By 1972, he was making £50,000 with each shipment. By the end of the year he was approached by Hamilton McMillan of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a friend from Oxford University, who recruited Marks to work for MI6 because of his connections in the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan, for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the IRA. The next year, Marks began exporting cannabis to the United States to The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional British pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country; he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking, often using his Oxford connections. As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport.

Following the Littlejohn affair, MI6 ceased their relationship with Marks, while his American operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member James Gater, leading to other arrests in Europe. Marks was arrested by Dutch police in 1973, but skipped bail in April 1974; the British press then made him a nationally known figure, reporting that he was feared abducted by the IRA for his connections with MI6. With most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities, he made his way to Italy, where he lived in a Winnebago for three months before returning to England in secret in October 1974. At this point he began a relationship with Judy Lane; the couple married in 1980 and had three children together. He had previously been in a five-year relationship with Rosie Lewis, with whom he had a daughter.

Marks then connected Ernie Combs, member of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, a man with connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal. With the help of the yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown&#x27;s mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs. A deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, leaving Marks a wealthy man. Other deals up to followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom. In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a deal between Combs and &#x27;Lebanese Sam&#x27; – making himself £300,000 in the process; he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice&#x27;s passport.

In the late 1970s, the Trafficante crime family, under the leadership of Santo Trafficante, Jr., were importing Colombian cannabis into the US on freighter ships, thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in America. In December 1979, Trafficante exported 50 tons of cannabis direct from Colombia to Marks and his contacts in the UK, enough to supply the entire British market for the drug for almost a year. In 1980, Marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £15 million of cannabis; police had followed associates of the Trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis. When arrested, he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence, as well as £30,000 in cash. Defended by Lord Hutchinson, Marks pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot;, concocting a story that he was an agent for MI6 (concealing the fact that his relation with MI6 ended in 1973) and the Mexican Secret Service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on James McCann (wanted in Britain for his IRA activities). The jury found him not guilty of drug smuggling but guilty of using false passports, and Marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentence was passed. HM Customs then arrested him for his part of a 1973 smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a three-year sentence.

Released in May 1982, though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime of which Marks had been acquitted, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle. In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell of cannabis and Marks accepted. Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal. Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America. He also arranged a deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam. Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service.

In 1984, he was approached to sell $300,000 worth of cannabis to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent looking to fund and arm the Mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation (Operation Cyclone). The agent&#x27;s contact on the APL ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the US, leaving the drugs in the hands of US officials; the agent subsequently fled to Brazil to avoid prosecution. Though under surveillance, Marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a Bangkok hotel with the help of Phil Sparrowhawk and Lord Moynihan. In 1986, he settled in Majorca, and continued to make vast sums smuggling Salim Malik&#x27;s hashish into America. The DEA were meanwhile tapping Marks&#x27;s phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested Ernie Combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis, when Marks was tipped off; the ship was redirected to Mauritius and the operation aborted. As he continued to avoid DEA stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts, finding that he could use Chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively.

When friends of his were busted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses; citing the fate of his friends and contacts, who were either in jail, informing the DEA, or smuggling heavier drugs. In 1988, DEA agent Craig Lovato arrested both Howard and Judy Marks and extradited the couple to the United States. Arrests of those involved in Marks&#x27;s various criminal activities were made in Britain, Spain, the Philippines, Thailand, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, the United States and Canada. This was the work of &#x27;Operation Eclectic&#x27;, set up in 1986 by both the DEA and Scotland Yard and aided by numerous other law enforcement organisations around the world.

==Trial and imprisonment==
Marks was taken from Palma to in Barcelona, and then to in Madrid. There he was handed a 40-page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between 1970 and 1987, charging him with operating a racket as described in the RICO act. In his autobiography, Marks stated that &quot;although the charge against Judy and some others were absurd, the formal accusations against me, in general terms, were true.&quot; The recently passed Sentencing Reform Act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole. The Audiencia Nacional ordered his extradition to Florida.

After being shown the prosecution evidence against him, Marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to Australia and that he never exported to the United States, and therefore never broke US law. He again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for MI6, and claimed that he was set up by the CIA because he had discovered that CIA agents were smuggling drugs into Australia. He and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into America seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into Australia; research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by Marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in Australia. Marks and his wife were extradited in 1989, and he was given the &quot;Miranda&quot; rights on the flight from Spain to the US.

In Florida, Judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released, having already served some months in prison in Spain. The money Marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees. He refused to plea-bargain or to inform on his associates, gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man. As the trial began in July 1990, Patrick Lane, his brother-in-law and fellow smuggler, wrote to Marks to inform him that he was going to testify against Marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself. Marks still was confident of beating the DEA in court, but Ernie Combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife, and Marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges. He was sentenced to 25 years in jail and given a $50,000 fine; though he had originally been sentenced to 15 years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his 10 and 15-year sentences were to run consecutively and not, as he had originally stated, concurrently.

He spent seven years imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, Indiana, a rough prison. He had originally been sentenced to Butner, but agent Lovato insisted that he instead serve time at Terre Haute. One of the six most secure prisons in the country, Terre Haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence. Despite this, Marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was &quot;British and a famous non-rat&quot; and avoided conflict &quot;by being nice, charming, and eccentric&quot;. During his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed Five Families, including: Gennaro &quot;Gerry Lang&quot; Langella (Colombo crime family); James &quot;Jimmy C&quot; Coonan, John &quot;Johnny Carnegs&quot; Carneglia, and Frank &quot;Frankie Loc&quot; LoCascio (Gambino crime family); Anthony &quot;Bruno&quot; Indelicato (Bonanno crime family); and Vittorio &quot;Little Vic&quot; Amuso, and Joey Testa (Lucchese crime family). He also made friends with Veronza Bowers, Jr. (Black Panther Party) and James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Nolan of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club.

Owing to his status as an Oxford University graduate with alleged connections to the British Secret Intelligence Service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement, though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff. During his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates, securing one overturned conviction. He gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence. In January 1995, Marks was granted parole after a prison officer testified that he was a model prisoner who spent much of his time helping his fellow prisoners pass their GED exams. He was released in April 1995.

==Life after release==
===Acting===
He acted in gangster film &quot;Killer Bitch&quot; (2010), starred in the film &quot;I Know You Know&quot; (2009), appeared as Satan in the 2006 movie adaptation of the Dirty Sanchez television series, and had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Human Traffic&quot; (1999). He appeared as himself in &quot;AmStarDam&quot; (aka &quot;Stoner Express&quot;) (2016).

=== Advocacy and politics ===
Marks stood for election to the UK Parliament in 1997, on the single issue of the legalisation of cannabis. He contested four seats at once—Norwich South (against future Home Secretary Charles Clarke), Norwich North, Neath and Southampton Test—and picked up around 1% of the vote. This led to the formation of the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (LCA) by Alun Buffry in 1999; the party reformed as Cannabis Law Reform in 2011.

He also argued for the legalisation of cannabis in numerous television programmes in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2010, he was interviewed on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. The Dutch Cannabis Seedbank Sensi Seeds dedicated their strain Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant to Marks for his advocacy work.

His close links to the likes of Gruff Rhys led to Marks being associated with the radical changes of the Cool Cymru movement and the changing face of modern Wales.

===Books===
Following his release from prison, Marks published an autobiography, &quot;Mr Nice&quot; (1996), which has been translated into several languages. He also compiled an anthology called &quot;The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories&quot; (2001) and a follow-on from his autobiography: &quot;Señor Nice: Straight Life From Wales to South America&quot; (2006). &quot;Señor Nice&quot; differs from his previous book as drugs are not central to the story and, while autobiographical, the book is more Marks&#x27;s own exploration of his claimed ancestor, the pirate Sir Henry Morgan. In 2011, he penned the thriller &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;. 
His final book &quot;Mr Smiley, My Last Pill and Testament&quot; was published in 2015 by Pan Macmillan.

Marks held a series of book-readings into 2014. In these live events he regaled his audiences with tales of his smuggling days and his time in prison, as well as offered insight into drug production and the arguments for legalisation of cannabis.

=== Comedy ===
He was booked to perform at the Welsh Comedy Festival in July 2007.

===Comics and videogame===
Marks and comic writer Pat Mills collaborated on comic strips which tied in with Sony&#x27;s &quot;inFamous 2&quot; video game.

===Music===
In the music world, he appeared as a guest on the BBC music quiz show &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. He also collaborated with Welsh group Super Furry Animals on their album &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; (released May 1996), which features a track entitled &quot;Hangin&#x27; With Howard Marks&quot;. The cover for the album featured a montage of photos of Marks. He also worked on their singles &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; and &quot;Ice Hockey Hair&quot;. He featured on the album &quot;Angel Headed Hip Hop&quot; (2009) with Lee Harris and River Styx. He also worked with former Happy Mondays guitarist Kav Sandhu, and appeared at numerous British music festivals, including: (Glastonbury 2009 and 2011), Beautiful Days, RockNess, Camp Bestival, Kendal Calling, and the Sonisphere Festival. He was featured on the Reverend &amp; The Makers track &quot;MDMAzing&quot; on their third album &quot;@Reverend Makers&quot; (2012).

==Works about Marks==
Marks was the subject of the biography &quot;High Time&quot; (1984) written by David Leigh.

Marks was also the subject of the film &quot;Mr. Nice&quot; (2010), named after his 1997 autobiography. The film featured Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chloë Sevigny as his wife Judy.

In 2013, Marks recounted his story in an episode of the television series &quot;Banged Up Abroad&quot;.

In November 2024, the BBC released a two part two hour documentary about Marks titled &quot;Hunting Mr Nice: The Cannabis Kingpin&quot;.

==Death==
On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Marks had inoperable colorectal cancer. He died of the disease on 10 April 2016, at the age of 70.

<text>Ludwig Bechstein (24 November 1801 – 14 May 1860) was a German writer and collector of folk fairy tales.

He was born in Weimar, the illegitimate child of Johanna Carolina Dorothea Bechstein and Hubert Dupontreau, a French emigrant who disappeared before the birth of the child; Ludwig thus grew up very poor in his first nine years. His situation improved only when his uncle Johann Matthäus Bechstein, a renowned naturalist and forester living in Meiningen in the country of Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, adopted him in 1810. He was sent to school in Meiningen, and in 1818, started an apprenticeship as a pharmacist.

From 1828 to 1831 he studied philosophy and literature in Leipzig and Munich thanks to a stipend granted by Duke Bernhard II of Sachsen-Meiningen, who hired him subsequently as a librarian. This lifetime post provided Bechstein with a continuous income, while leaving him a lot of freedom to pursue his own interests and writing. He lived from 1831 until his death in Meiningen. In his honor, a fountain was built in the English Garden.

Bechstein published many works and was a successful author of his time. His &quot;German Fairy Tale Book&quot; was even more popular than the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s collection when it was first published in 1845. He published several collections of folk tales, and also published romances and poems

<text>The Congress of the Dominican Republic () is the bicameral legislature of the government of the Dominican Republic, consisting of two houses, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Both senators and deputies are chosen through direct election. There are no term limits for either chamber.

As provided by the Dominican Constitution, each of the 178 members of the Chamber of Deputies represents a district and serves a four-year term. Chamber seats are apportioned among the states by population. The 32 Senators serve staggered four-year terms. Each province has one senator, regardless of population.

The Constitution vests all legislative power in the Congress. The Chamber and Senate are equal partners in the legislative process (legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers); however, the Constitution grants each chamber some unique powers. The Senate is empowered to approve treaties and presidential appointments. Revenue-raising bills must originate in the Chamber of Deputies, which also has the sole power of impeachment, while the Senate has the sole power to try impeachment cases.

The Congress meets in the Palace of Congress in Santo Domingo.

The term Congress actually refers to a particular meeting of the national legislature, reckoned according to the terms of representatives. Congressional elections are held in even numbered years divisible by four. Suffrage is universal and compulsory for all Dominican citizens aged over 18 or under that age if married.

==History==
The Congress of the Dominican Republic was founded after the drafting of the Constitution, on 6 November 1844. In the chapter 2 of this Constitution is mentioned how the legislature would be divided into two legislative bodies called Tribunat (corresponding to the current House of Deputies) and Conservative Council (corresponding to the current Senate). Earlier, deputies and senators were elected by indirect and based on census vote and candidates could only be those with properties.

In 1854, the Constitution was amended to change the name of the Conservative Senate Council. Later, in December of the same year, a new revision to the Constitution was made to merge the two chambers in a Consultant Senate, being the first period in the history of the Dominican Republic in which the legislature was governed by a unicameral Congress. The bicameral system was again replaced in November 1865 after the Restoration of the Republic, separating the Congress in a .

Between 1866 and 1907, the Dominican Republic is disputed between bicameral and unicameral, eliminating the Senate in the constitutional amendment of 1866, restoring it in 1878, and returning it to eliminate in 1880. The Senate reappeared as house of Congress in the Constitution of 1908, from which the bicameral system remained constant. During the first US intervention, Congress was dissolved not before elected president Francisco Henriquez y Carvajal. After the restoration of national sovereignty, Congress was again restored, and in 1927 the election of legislators were allowed by direct vote.

With the rise of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo to power, the Congress became a cover for his political ambitions. In 1935, Trujillo was appointed by the Congress president for life, instituted on January 11 of each year as the Day of the Benefactor, and renamed the capital city Ciudad Trujillo. In 1941, Congress recognized the civil rights of women, allowing women to vote in the country.

After Trujillo&#x27;s death, and after deposition of the constitutional government of Juan Bosch in 1963, Congress was dissolved by the Triumvirate. On 25 April 1965 a military group seeking to restore the Constitution of 1963 and replace the president Bosch entered the National Palace and made capitulate to Triumvirate, after which the newly restored Congress was sworn in as provisional president to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Jose Rafael Molina Ureña. However, President Urena had to resign two days later and applied for asylum. At this, the Congress appointed provisional president Francisco Alberto Caamaño Deñó, who took office on May 4 in front of a crowd at Independence Park.

After the second US intervention, and after the new constitutional government elected in 1966, under the presidency of Joaquín Balaguer, Congress made the longest constitutional reform of all constitutional reforms. This Constitution was amended in 1994 to prohibit presidential re-election and separate congressional and presidential elections (which had been held together since the reform of 1927) with 2 years apart.

Congress passed a constitutional amendment in May 2002, to restore the limitation of only 2 consecutive reelections. During the election of President of the Chamber of Deputies on 16 August 2003, there was a shooting inside the room of the legislative chamber.

Later in the constitutional reform of 2010, Congress passed a non-consecutive presidential reelection law, and rejoined the congressional and presidential elections, which are exceptionally extended the term of elected legislators in 2010 from 4 to 6 years until 2016.

=== Reviewing and guiding the executive ===
Congress exercises its review function by means of the Speech of Accountability and inquests. The Speech of Accountability it is the responsibility of the President of the Republic to report annually, before Congress, on the budgetary, financial and management administration that occurred in the previous year, as established in article 128, paragraph 2, subparagraph f) of the Constitution, An explanatory message of the macroeconomic and fiscal projections, expected economic, financial and social results and the main priorities that the government intends to implement under the General State Budget Law approved for the current year. The Constitution also contemplate that Congress should receive reports from the Chamber of Account, the Ministries and the Ombudsman.

=== Inquests ===
The legislative chambers, as well as the permanent and special commissions which they constitute, may invite ministers, vice ministers, directors and other civil servants of the Public Administration, as well as any natural or legal person, to provide pertinent information on matters of Which are empowered.

The reluctance of the persons cited to appear or to render the required declarations, can be sanctioned by the criminal courts of the Republic with the penalty indicated by the current legal provisions for cases of contempt of public authorities, at the request of the corresponding chamber.

To question ministers and vice ministers, the Governor of the Central Bank and the directors or administrators of autonomous and decentralized agencies of the State, as well as those of entities that administer public funds on matters within their competence, when agreed by the majority of members Present, at the request of at least three legislators, as well as to obtain information from other public officials competent in the matter and dependent on the previous ones. If the said official or official does not appear without justifiable cause or their statements are considered unsatisfactory, the chambers, with the vote of two thirds of their members present, may cast a vote of censure against them and recommend their dismissal from the office. President of the Republic or the corresponding hierarchical superior for breach of responsibility.

=== National Assembly and Joint sessions ===
When the Chamber and the Senate celebrate they meetings together is denominated National Assembly, the Assembly it&#x27;s usually call for the Speech of Accountability and to celebrate the commemorative or protocolary acts.

To a joint session to be declare as National Assembly the plenary most have more than half of the members of each chamber present. Its decisions shall be taken by an absolute majority of votes, except when it is convened to amend the Constitution. The National Assembly or the Joint session of both chambers are governed by its rules of organization and operation. In both cases the presidency will be assume by the President of the Senate; The vice president, the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the secretariat, the secretaries of each chamber.

Its responsibility of the National Assembly:
* To know and decide on constitutional reforms, acting in this case, as a National Revisory Assembly;
* To examine the minutes of election of the President or President and of the Vice-President or Vice-President of the Republic;
* To proclaim to the President and Vice President of the Republic, receive their oath and accept or reject their resignations;
* Exercise the powers conferred by this Constitution and the organic regulation.

== Latest election ==
The latest election for the Congress was in 2020, as part of the 
general election.

<text>Victor Koman (born August 9, 1954) is an American science fiction and fantasy writer and agorist. A three-time winner of the Prometheus Award, Koman is mainly popular in the libertarian community. He is the owner of the publishing house KoPubCo. His Ph.D. in Information Technology was conferred by Capella University in 2016. He also possesses a BSIS (with honors, summa cum laude) from University of Redlands (2001) and an MBA from Pepperdine University (2004).

Koman&#x27;s short stories have appeared in such publications as &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, and the anthologies &quot;Weird Menace&quot;, &quot;The King is Dead: Tales of Elvis Post-Mortem&quot;, the second and third &quot;Dark Destiny&quot; collections set in the White Wolf &quot;World of Darkness&quot;, and the libertarian short-story collection &quot;Free Space&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Koman collaborated with Andrew J. Offutt on Offutt&#x27;s &quot;Spaceways&quot; series for Playboy Press (which was sold to Berkley Books in mid-stride). Koman wrote two novels in the series, to which Offutt added his own scenes, then edited and published the novels under the series name &quot;John Cleve&quot;. These paperbacks are long out of print. Covers for both novels were painted by Ken Barr.

A community activist, Koman was instrumental in preventing the 1988 destruction of the Disneyland Monorail System&#x27;s last bubble-topped Mark III monorail (&quot;Old Red&quot;), generating a one-man public-relations campaign that resulted in nationwide news coverage. The Walt Disney Company subsequently saved, restored, and converted the historic monorail fuselage into a street-legal promotional vehicle.

Koman&#x27;s 1995 story collaboration with Brad Linaweaver, &quot;The Light That Blinds&quot;, features an occult battle between Aleister Crowley and Adolf Hitler.

Koman has appeared as an extra in several films, including &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, &quot;CyberZone&quot;, &quot;Rapid Assault&quot;, &quot;Fugitive Rage&quot;, &quot;Mom’s Outta Sight&quot;, &quot;Billy Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;KidWitch&quot; (in which his daughter, Vanessa Koman, played the title role), &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Hot Chick&quot;, and &quot;A-List (film)&quot;. On November 15, 1998, he was the winner on the game show &quot;Inquizition&quot;.

Koman has made available the body of work of Samuel Edward Konkin III through KoPubCo. He is the pseudonymous author of the Gloamingerism pamphlets published as afterwords in the 1999 trade paperback edition of J. Neil Schulman&#x27;s novel &quot;Alongside Night&quot;.

<text>Dryland farming and dry farming encompass specific agricultural techniques for the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Dryland farming is associated with drylands, areas characterized by a cool wet season (which charges the soil with virtually all the moisture that the crops will receive prior to harvest) followed by a warm dry season. They are also associated with arid conditions, areas prone to drought and those having scarce water resources.

== Process ==

Dryland farming has evolved as a set of techniques and management practices to adapt to limited availability of water, as in the Western US and other regions affected by climate change for crops such as tomato and maize.

In marginal regions, a farmer should be financially able to survive occasional crop failures, perhaps for several years in succession. Survival as a dryland farmer requires careful husbandry of the moisture available for the crop and aggressive management of expenses to minimize losses in poor years. Dryland farming involves the constant assessing of the amount of moisture present or lacking for any given crop cycle and planning accordingly. Dryland farmers know that to be financially successful they have to be aggressive during the good years in order to offset the dry years.

Dryland farming is dependent on natural rainfall, which can leave the ground vulnerable to dust storms, particularly if poor farming techniques are used or if the storms strike at a particularly vulnerable time. The fact that a fallow period must be included in the crop rotation means that fields cannot always be protected by a cover crop, which might otherwise offer protection against erosion.

Some of the theories of dryland farming developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries claimed to be scientific but were in reality pseudoscientific and did not stand up to empirical testing. For example, it was alleged that tillage would seal in moisture, but such &quot;dust mulching&quot; ideas are based on what people imagine &quot;should&quot; happen, or have been told, rather than what testing actually confirms. In actuality, it has been shown that tillage increases water losses to evaporation. The book &quot;Bad Land: An American Romance&quot; explores the effects that this had on people who were encouraged to homestead in an area with little rainfall; most smallholdings failed after working miserably to cling on.

Dry farming depends on making the best use of the &quot;bank&quot; of soil moisture that was created by winter rainfall. Some dry farming practices include:

* Wider than normal spacing, to provide a larger bank of moisture for each plant.
* Controlled Traffic.
* Minimal tilling of land.
* Strict weed control, to ensure that weeds do not consume soil moisture needed by the cultivated plants.
* Cultivation of soil to produce a &quot;dust mulch&quot;, thought to prevent the loss of water through capillary action. This practice is controversial, and is not universally advocated.
* Selection of crops and cultivars suited for dry farming practices.

== Locations ==

Dry farming may be practiced in areas that have significant annual rainfall during a wet season, often in the winter. Crops are cultivated during the subsequent dry season, using practices that make use of the stored moisture in the soil. California, Colorado, Kansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming, in the United States, are a few states where dry farming is practiced for a variety of crops.

Dryland farming is used in the Great Plains, the Palouse plateau of Eastern Washington, and other arid regions of North America such as in the Southwestern United States and Mexico (see Agriculture in the Southwestern United States and Agriculture in the prehistoric Southwest), the Middle East and in other grain growing regions such as the steppes of Eurasia and Argentina. Dryland farming was introduced to southern Russia and Ukraine by Ukrainian Mennonites under the influence of Johann Cornies, making the region the breadbasket of Europe. In Australia, it is widely practiced in all states but the Northern Territory.

== Crops ==

The choice of crop is influenced by the timing of the predominant rainfall in relation to the seasons. For example, winter wheat is more suited to regions with higher winter rainfall while areas with summer wet seasons may be more suited to summer growing crops such as sorghum, sunflowers or cotton. Dry farmed crops may include grapes, tomatoes, pumpkins, beans, and other summer crops. 

Dryland grain crops include wheat, corn, millet, rye, and other grasses that produce grains. These crops grow using the winter water stored in the soil, rather than depending on rainfall during the growing season.

Successful dryland farming is possible with as little as of precipitation a year; higher rainfall increases the variety of crops.

== Other considerations ==

Capturing and conservation of moisture: In regions such as Eastern Washington, the average annual precipitation available to a dryland farm may be as little as . In the Horse Heaven Hills in central Washington, wheat farming has been productive purportedly on an average annual rainfall approaching 6 inches. Consequently, moisture must be captured until the crop can utilize it. Techniques include summer fallow rotation (in which one crop is grown on two seasons&#x27; precipitation, leaving standing stubble and crop residue to trap snow), and preventing runoff by terracing fields. &quot;Terracing&quot; is also practiced by farmers on a smaller scale by laying out the direction of furrows to slow water runoff downhill, usually by plowing along either contours or keylines. Moisture can be conserved by eliminating weeds and leaving crop residue to shade the soil.

Effective use of available moisture: Once moisture is available for the crop to use, it must be used as effectively as possible. Seed planting depth and timing are carefully considered to place the seed at a depth at which sufficient moisture exists, or where it will exist when seasonal precipitation falls. Farmers tend to use crop varieties which are drought-tolerant and heat-stress tolerant (even lower-yielding varieties). Thus the likelihood of a successful crop is hedged if seasonal precipitation fails.

Soil conservation: The nature of dryland farming makes it particularly susceptible to erosion, especially wind erosion. Some techniques for conserving soil moisture (such as frequent tillage to kill weeds) are at odds with techniques for conserving topsoil. Since healthy topsoil is critical to sustainable agriculture, in particular within arid areas, its preservation is generally considered the most important long-term goal of a dryland farming operation. Erosion control techniques such as windbreaks, reduced tillage or no-till, spreading straw (or other mulch on particularly susceptible ground), and strip farming are used to minimize topsoil loss.

Weedling: Weedling is process of turning over 90 degree and exposing weed&#x27;s root during tillage to prevent soil erosion by wind and desertification. At the same time, Direct absorption of nutrients from weeds and moisture provides suitable environment to floris biodiversity of organisms in soil.

Control of input costs: Dryland farming is practiced in regions inherently marginal for non-irrigated agriculture. Because of this, there is an increased risk of crop failure and poor yields which may occur in a dry year (regardless of money or effort expended). Dryland farmers must evaluate the potential yield of a crop constantly throughout the growing season and be prepared to decrease inputs to the crop such as fertilizer and weed control if it appears that it is likely to have a poor yield due to insufficient moisture. Conversely, in years when moisture is abundant, farmers may increase their input efforts and budget to maximize yields and to offset poor harvests.

== Arid-zone agriculture ==

Arid-zone agriculture, or desert agriculture, is the subject of research and development that includes studies of how to increase the agricultural productivity of lands dominated by a lack of fresh water, an abundance of heat and sunlight, and usually one or more of the following: Extreme winter cold, short rainy season, saline soil or water, strong dry winds, poor soil structure, overgrazing, limited technological development, poverty, or political instability.

The two basic approaches are:

* View the given environmental and socioeconomic characteristics as negative obstacles to be overcome.
* View as many as possible of them as positive resources to be used.

<text>The Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) was an English railway company incorporated in 1836 intended to link London with Ipswich via Colchester, and then extend to Norwich and Yarmouth.

Construction began in 1837 on the first at the London end. Construction was beset by engineering and other problems, leading to severe financial difficulties. As a result, the project was truncated at Colchester in 1843 but through a series of acquisitions (including the Eastern Union Railway who completed the link between Colchester and Norwich) and opening of other lines, the ECR became the largest of the East Anglian railways.

In 1862 ECR was merged with a number of other companies to form the Great Eastern Railway.

==Opening==
In 1835, a surveyor called Henry Sayer presented a plan for a new railway from London to York via Cambridge to London solicitors Dimes &amp; Boyman. Together with John Clinton Robertson who was to become the first secretary of the ECR and engineers John Braithwaite it was concluded that this scheme was too optimistic and a scheme from London to Norwich via Colchester and Ipswich would be more viable.

A tour of the key towns on the route followed where considerable opposition from landowners, from sections of the press and members of the public was encountered. Despite this the prospectus of the Grand Eastern Counties Railway was first prepared in 1834 by John Braithwaite. The bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 19 February 1836, and after a stormy passage (two rival schemes had also surfaced in the interim as well as continuing opposition from land owners), it was authorised by an act of Parliament, the (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. cvi) on 4 July 1836.

Construction of the line began in late March 1837 and progress east of Stratford was relatively easy as the land was largely arable. Indeed, a good number of windmills had to be demolished in order to get the railway built. West of Stratford the line had to cross the unstable Bow Marshes and after that, the built-up nature of the area meant that the railway had to be built on expensive viaducts.

The two-track railway opened on 20 June 1839 from a temporary terminus at in Mile End, Middlesex, as far as in Essex. On opening day, two trains topped and tailed by locomotives proceeded along the line watched by crowds of people. Guests of the company enjoyed a sumptuous banquet at Romford enlivened by the sound of cannon and the band of the Coldstream Guards. The strain of building the initial line and continuing disputes with landowners continued to take its toll on the company&#x27;s finances. ECR backers in Norfolk and Suffolk were demanding work start in their area and the company was forced to go to Parliament to increase its capital, although this move was rejected. Later in 1839 shareholders decided a call for £3 per share should be made (in effect an additional payment by them) although this was reduced to £2 per share in January 1840 which released enough money for the ECR to continue construction.

On 1 July 1840, the ECR opened an extension at the London end to its permanent terminus at Shoreditch (renamed Bishopsgate in 1846) and at the country end to . The line between Stratford and Shoreditch was, from 15 September 1840, used by trains of the Northern and Eastern Railway (N&amp;ER) whose line to Broxbourne opened, although at first the trains were not permitted to call at Stratford.

By 1840, it was clear that additional money would be required to complete the ECR line to Colchester. This stretch included 64 bridges or viaducts in addition to numerous culverts, embankments and cuttings. A successful application for more capital was made to Parliament and work continued. The winter of 1841 proved very wet and delayed work even further.

Finally on 25 February 1843, a special inspection train left Shoreditch for Colchester. However, the train was stopped at Brentwood as a timber viaduct at Mountnessing had subsided and it was unsafe to continue. On 7 March 1843, goods trains started operation followed by the commencement of passenger services on 29 March.

The costs were as follows:

The line ran to , a distance of to Shoreditch station; the route is now part of the Great Eastern Main Line.

==Development==

In 1843, the directors were approached with a proposal to build a line from Stratford to the River Thames with the intention of sending out agricultural produce by rail with coal forming the bulk of the traffic the other way. A bill came before Parliament sponsored by the Eastern Counties, Stratford and Thames Junction Railway Company and it was the that built the line through to opening on 14 June 1847.

As mentioned, the had built a line from Stratford – Broxbourne and shared the Shoreditch terminus. This railway had extended to in 1842 and in 1843 and was in the process of extending its line towards . Following on from negotiations in 1843, the took over operation of the from 1 January 1844 paying rent and dividing the profits until this railway was finally acquired by the Great Eastern Railway in 1902.
Following the acquisition of the the concentrated on building the line towards Newport (Essex) and on 4 July 1844, Parliament passed the (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. lxii) authorising the to extend to Cambridge and Brandon in Norfolk where an end on connection with the Norfolk Railway would offer a through route to . This route opened on 29 July 1845.

In 1845, the was surveying towards Ardleigh with the intention of extending to Harwich although this scheme failed to get parliamentary backing.
Late in 1845, George Hudson was invited by the shareholders to become chairman and an upswing in the lines finances resulted. Hudson then proposed various schemes designed to take the towards York and Lincoln joining up with his North Midland Railway at South Milford. One scheme that came to fruition was the line from Peterborough via March to Ely which opened on 14 January 1847. Increasing passenger numbers at Bishopsgate (renamed from Shoreditch in 1846) saw that station extended in the same year.

The refusal of the to extend northwards towards Ipswich led to the formation of the Eastern Union Railway, who opened their line between Colchester and Ipswich in 1846.
Other openings in 1847 included to Wisbech East on 3 May and on 17 August, Cambridge to St Ives where a junction with the East Anglian Railway&#x27;s (EAR) St Ives to Huntingdon line was created. In fact the operated the to line on behalf of the , but it proved so unprofitable that they threatened to withdraw from the arrangement in October 1849. In the end operation by the restarted with them paying the 25 shillings per day to do so.

The financial depression of 1847–48 saw the rein back some of its ambitions although the loop line from St Ives to was opened on 1 February 1848 and the took over the working of the Norfolk Railway on 2 May which extended the empire to Fakenham, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth. Construction also started on a branch to in March 1847 and the first goods trains ran in August 1848 followed by the opening to passenger trains on 2 October of the same year.

By 1849, things were going poorly for chairman George Hudson, and following his non-attendance at the AGM the shareholders, who had received a very small dividend, set up a committee to look into his financial management of the company.

A short branch to Enfield was opened on 1 March 1849. This linked to the current station (then called Edmonton). Later the same month the to Fakenham line, the building of which had been started by the Norfolk Railway, was opened by the on 20 March 1849.

The did not enjoy good relations with the London and Blackwall Railway (L&amp;BR). They had built the London &amp; Blackwall Extension Railway from Stepney East which was supposed to have a junction with the at Bow Junction. This was not connected and an ill-served interchange station called Victoria Park &amp; Bow lasted until 1850. Both the and the had been promoting railways to Tilbury and it was in September 1851 that the directors asked George Parker Bidder to approach the with regard to a joint bill.

There were no additions to the network in 1850, and in 1851 a short branch from what is now Shepreth Branch Junction near Shelford to Shepreth was built. Back in 1848 Parliament granted authority to the Royston and Hitchin Railway to extend their line from Royston. Although Cambridge was its goal, Parliament sanctioned only an extension as far as Shepreth (as the Eastern Counties Railway had opposed the extension to Cambridge). The line was completed in 1851 and initially the GNR, who had leased the Royston and Hitchin Railway in the interim, ran a connecting horse-drawn omnibus service. This proved unsuccessful so the new line and the line to Hitchin were leased to the Eastern Counties Railway for 14 years, with a connection at Shepreth to enable the to run trains from Cambridge to Hitchin.

In 1852, the took over operation of the East Anglian Railway (EAR). The company&#x27;s property had been taken over by the receiver in June 1850 and the was leased to the Great Northern Railway (GNR). The had running powers over the line between Peterborough, March and Wisbech (opened 1847). Unfortunately, they had not applied for running rights over the line that linked the and stations at Wisbech and the refused access so that the passengers had to change stations by horse-bus. However, shareholder opposition within the and were the real reason why the withdrew from the arrangement allowing the to take over operation of the .

In 1853, the Eastern Union Railway (EUR) was in serious financial trouble having built lines to Norwich, Bury St Edmunds (as the Ipswich and Bury Railway), Sudbury and had a branch to Harwich under construction. Negotiations began between the and and on 1 January 1854 the took over the working of the although this was not formally ratified until the Eastern Counties and the Norfolk and Eastern Union, the East Anglian, and the Newmarket Railways Act 1854 (17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. ccxx) of 7 August 1854. The two companies did not formally merge until they amalgamated with other railways to form the Great Eastern Railway in 1862.

The Harwich branch whilst built by the was opened by the , the following week on 15 August.

The also took over the Newmarket Railway in 1854 which linked Cambridge with Ipswich Bury St Edmunds.

In 1854, the / owned London Tilbury and Southend Railway started operating over the Forest Gate Junction to Bow Junction and onto . Early trains split at Stratford with a portion of the train to Bishopsgate station. A third line between Stratford and Bow Junction was built to help accommodate this traffic and services had running rights into Fenchurch Street via the London and Blackwall Railway extension route.

A line was also provided linking Victoria Park station on the North London Railway with Stratford Low Level and Stratford Market stations which was primarily for goods traffic. The Loughton branch of the was opened on 22 August 1856 with a junction just north of Stratford on the Cambridge line.

In 1859, the East Suffolk Railway (ESR) finished building a series of lines in Suffolk and south east Norfolk. These were all taken over by the on opening day 1 June 1859. The line from Ipswich (East Suffolk Junction) to Woodbridge (at the south end of the ) also opened on this day giving a through route between Ipswich, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth (South Town).

The final railway opened by the before the incorporation of the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1862 took place on 12 April 1860, when the Leiston branch in East Suffolk was extended to Aldeburgh.

==Operations==

===Accidents and incidents===
* In September 1840, a train was in a rear-end collision with a passenger train at Old Ford, Middlesex. One person was killed.
* On 8 May 1846, Elizabeth Ingham was killed whilst operating at Little Thetford Crossing. Her 3-year-old had followed onto the tracks and into the path of an oncoming train. She successfully rushed to save her child, but was hit by the train and killed instantly. 
* In November 1846, an Inquest was held at the New Inn, Roydon, yesterday week, on the body of Elizabeth Coleman, aged eleven years, who was killed upon the above line. The deceased was, it appeared, endeavouring to cross the line at a point near the Roydon station where the Lockroad crosses the line on a level, when she was struck by the buffer of a Cambridge train, and killed upon the spot. The jury returned a verdict of &quot;Accidental death&quot;. The inquest would have taken place on Wednesday, 25 November 1846 
* In September 1853, a freight train came to a halt near , Suffolk, due to a defect on the locomotive. The driver of a second freight train ignored a red signal and consequently his train was in a rear-end collision with the first. Time interval working was in force.
* On 20 February 1860, a passenger train derailed at Tottenham, Middlesex, when a tyre broke on the locomotive hauling it. Seven people were killed.

===Engine sheds and works===
The first engine shed was located at Whalebone Lane, Chadwell Heath opening in 1839 with the railway. Following the extension of the ECR to Brentwood in 1840, a &quot;railway factory&quot; at Romford (between the current stations of Chadwell Heath and (on the east side of the line) was built being fully operational by 1842. The most significant task the factory undertook was the gauge conversion of the ECR stock in 1844.

As the ECR, grew it became apparent that a new site would be needed and land was acquired at Stratford between the ECR Colchester line and the N&amp;ER line to Cambridge. The N&amp;ER had already established an engine shed at this location when their line to Broxbourne had opened in 1840.

At this stage, Stratford was a largely rural location with plenty of land being available and in connection with this move the ECR built 300 new houses for the work force.

Stratford engine shed and Stratford Works initially shared this site and it was not until the 1860s that the GER moved the engine sheds to the other side of the Cambridge line.

Various other engine sheds grew up around the expanding ECR network either being constructed by the ECR or the railways it took over; for example Ipswich engine shed which was built by the Eastern Union Railway.

===Locomotives===

====Early Eastern Counties locomotives====
In order to build the line, the ECR purchased four 0-4-0 ballast locomotives delivered in late 1838 and named Suffolk, Norfolk, Essex and Middlesex. These and the next six engines ordered were built by Braithwaite, Milner and Co. Six 2-2-0 locomotives (original numbers 1 to 6) were the first ECR passenger engines and had a poor reputation with regard to derailments. Braithwaite, Milner and Co supplied another similar locomotive in 1839 which was number 7. Two 0-4-0 goods engines (8 and 9) were also ordered from Braithwaite, Milner and Co in 1840 lasting until 1849 when they were sold.

In 1841 Lancashire firm Jones, Turner and Evans supplied four 2-2-0 locomotives (Nos 12 to 15) which lasted until 1850. Later the same year Burys supplied two 0-4-2 passenger locomotives (Nos 10 and 11) to the ECR.

Numbers 16 and 17 were 2-2-0 passenger singles ordered from Bury and Co and were in service in early 1842. Later in 1842 The ECR board ordered eight more Bury singles (Nos 18 to 26). Some of these engines survived until 1859–60. 
These were all the locomotives purchased before the acquisition of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1844 and the gauge conversion of late 1844 when many of these engines were converted to UK standard gauge at the Romford factory.

====Locomotive fleet as at 1856====
As described above, the ECR grew up in piecemeal fashion at times ordering its own locomotives, and then acquiring other companies&#x27; locomotives when the firms were taken over. This makes the history quite complex and the table below is an overview of the company&#x27;s locomotives in 1856.

====Robert Sinclair====
Robert Sinclair took over as Locomotive Superintendent after Gooch’s departure. In 1858, he designed a small class of 2-4-0 (known as Z class) built by Rothwell and Co. These were locomotives numbered 301 to 306.

As can be seen from the table above, he inherited a mixed bag of locomotives and set out on a road of standardisation. Perhaps the best example of this was his Y class 2-4-0 introduced in 1859, which when finished (in Great Eastern days and after Sinclair had departed the company) numbered 110 locomotives. Although the general design was the same the locomotives were built by a number of different companies including Kitsons, Vulcan and in 1865 (in GER days) the French railway firm Schneider at cie.

The ECR sent the first Y class No 327 (an example built by Stephenson) to the 1862 International Exhibition where it caught the eye of the Egyptian government who ordered 11 similar locomotives.

Sinclair’s only other design (for the ECR) was the five strong X class 2-4-0WT introduced in 1862 and built at Stratford Works. Numbered 120 to 124 (noting the similarly numbered locomotives in the above table had been renumbered or withdrawn) these were deployed on the line to North Woolwich.

===Carriages===
The Railway Act 1844 laid down standards for third-class carriages. Facilities were very spartan with wooden benches seating 46 passengers who could access the three compartments through three doors. The middle compartment seated 18 passengers whilst the end compartments seated 14 each.

It is known that carriages were built at Stratford Works and Fairfield Works in Bow.

An ECR first class carriage has survived and is part of the UK national collection.
===Goods traffic===
Goods traffic on the ECR was largely agricultural in nature. The table below shows a breakdown of the traffic carried week ending 6 May 1849.

===Innovations===

====Use of steam excavating machine====
Railways in the UK were generally built by pick, shovel and large numbers of railway navvies. Engineer John Braithwaite deployed the first steam excavating machine used on a UK railway at Brentwood (exact date unknown but working in 1843).

====Two wheel pony truck====
The ECR was the first railway company to use a two-wheel pony truck, in 1859, using the design of American inventor Levi Bissell. This innovation was patented in the USA on 2 November 1858 and on 1 December 1858 in Great Britain. In the summer of 1859 the ECR fitted the truck to locomotive 248, a Kitsons built 2-4-0 of 1855, and it was reported that the ride of the locomotive was improved and wheel flange wear noticeably reduced.
====An early steam coach====
In 1849 the ECR introduced a steam rail motor called Enfield which worked on the Enfield Branch Line.
This locomotive was a 2-2-0 locomotive and 36-seat four-compartment coach on one frame and was built by William Bridges Adams in 1849 at Fairfield Works, Bow. It proved reasonably successful and in fact not long after delivery covered the route from Bishopsgate to Norwich via Cambridge in a creditable (for the time) 3 hours 35 minutes.

Enfield was later converted to a 2-2-2T locomotive as the difficulty of a combined locomotive/carriage (presumably too long for early turntables?) became apparent.

===Track gauge===
At the time of the railway&#x27;s construction, there was no legislation dictating the choice of gauge. The ECR directors favoured the Great Western Railway&#x27;s broad gauge of but, mainly on the grounds of cost, construction engineer John Braithwaite recommended a gauge of . The N&amp;ER, which was planning to use the ECR between Stratford and Bishopsgate, was forced to adopt the same gauge.

With the extension of the ECR in the early 1840s, it became apparent that was a better choice, and in September and October 1844 gauge conversion was carried out, along with the N&amp;ER, which had merged with the ECR on 1 January 1844.

==People==

===Railway organisation (1830s and 1840s)===
The directors were responsible for appointing staff whilst a finance committee decided the wages. The engineer was responsible for rolling stock and permanent way whilst the traffic manager dealt with operations. Stations were run by a police sergeant who had ticket clerks under them and they reported to a number of inspectors and an overall manager. Other policemen were responsible for the operation of points and signals as well as more familiar duties.
Conductors were in charge of trains assisted by guards and a small number of porters.

===Locomotive superintendents===
* John Hunter 1846–1850 
* John Viret Gooch 1850–1856 was dismissed for financial irregularities (details on that entry). 
* Robert Sinclair 1856–1863 was the first Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Eastern Railway.

===Chairmen===

* William Tite the architect, was the first chairman.
* 1836–1845 Henry Bosanquet – a director of the Westminster Bank 
* 1845–1849 George Hudson

:Hudson was appointed chairman of the ailing Eastern Counties Railway in 1845 and one of his first actions was to appoint David Waddington as his vice chairman. Hudson was interested in the ECR as he felt it offered an opportunity for an alternative route from York to London although the truth was the ECR had an appalling reputation for time keeping and safety at this time; Hudson immediately ordered the payment of a generous dividend for the shareholders.

:Later investigation showed that whilst Hudson decided the levels of dividends to be paid to shareholders it was Waddington&#x27;s job to doctor the traffic accounts to make it appear legally earned. Waddington also siphoned off £8,000 of the ECR&#x27;s money into a parliamentary slush fund which strained relations between Hudson and Waddington.

:Hudson cut costs in a similar way on the North Midland Railway and an accident at Romford on 18 July 1846 led the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; to petition Hudson to the effect that:
::&quot;by reason of the misconduct, negligence and insobriety of drivers and sundry stokers, engineers, policemen, and others, your Majesty&#x27;s subjects, various and several collisions, explosions and oversettings are continually taking place on the railways, your Majesty&#x27;s dominion&quot;.

* 1849–1850 Edward Ladd Betts – rail contractor and business partner of Samuel Morton Peto. 
* 1851–1856 David Waddington – Waddington had been vice-chairman under the Hudson regime and was dismissed after investigation of financial irregularities along with Gooch. 
* 1856–1862 Horatio Love – Love was the first chairman of the Great Eastern Railway between 1862 and 1863.

==Woolwich Ferry==

Following the opening of the line to North Woolwich the ECR ordered two ferries called &quot;Essex&quot; and &quot;Kent&quot; from Blyth &amp; Co of Barking. The two wooden paddle steamers weighed 65 tons (gross), long, beam and depth. The cost for each boat was £3,250.

Between June and August 1854, 113,315 passengers used the ferry, whilst a year later this had risen to 141,025. In 1856 the two ferries were overhauled at Blyth &amp; Co and continued in use on the ferry for a number of years after the 1862 merger with the Great Eastern.

==Merger into the Great Eastern Railway==
Between 1851 and 1854 the ECR had under the chairmanship of David Waddington negotiated arrangements to work most of the other railways in East Anglia resulting in a network of lines totalling . Whilst Parliament favoured competition it was also aware that the ECR was constantly at war with its neighbours and whilst these working arrangements were approved there was a condition that a bill for full amalgamation was to be presented to Parliament by 1861.

Waddington departed under a cloud in 1856 and was replaced by Horatio Love. By 1860 many shareholders were unhappy listing several grievances they saw as getting in the way of their dividend payments. These included, continual conflict over the working of other lines, suspicion and distrust of the joint committee, inadequate services to and from London, ongoing litigation and legal costs and a lack of progress on amalgamation.

By February 1862 the bill had its second reading and was then followed by a lengthy committee process where various parties petitioned against the bill. On 7 August 1862 the bill passed and the Great Eastern Railway was formed by the amalgamation of the Eastern Counties Railway and a number of smaller railways.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 is an afterburning turbofan developed for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, a single-engine strike fighter. It has two variants; a Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) variant used in the F-35A and F-35C, and a two-cycle Short Take-Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant used in the F-35B that includes a forward lift fan. The first production engines were delivered in 2009.

Developed from the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engine used on the F-22 Raptor, the F135 produces around of thrust and with afterburner. The F135 competed with the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 to power the F-35.

==Development==
The F135 originated with Lockheed Corporation Skunk Works, with efforts to develop a stealthy STOVL strike fighter for the U.S. Marine Corps under a 1986 DARPA project under the auspices of the Advanced STOVL (ASTOVL) program, an early progenitor of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) that resulted in the F-35. Lockheed engineer Paul Bevilaqua developed and eventually patented a concept aircraft and a propulsion system called the Shaft-Driven Lift Fan (SDLF), and then turned to Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) to build a demonstrator engine. The ground test demonstrator used the first stage fan from a F119 engine for the lift fan. The engine fan and core from the F100-PW-220 were used for the core of the demonstrator engine, and the larger low-pressure turbine from the F100-PW-229 was used for the low-pressure turbine of the demonstrator engine. The larger turbine was used to provide the additional power required to operate the lift fan through the low-pressure spool shaft, which would be engaged by a clutch in STOVL mode. Finally, a variable thrust deflecting nozzle was added to complete the &quot;F100-229-&quot;Plus&quot;&quot; demonstrator engine. This ground demonstrator engine proved the shaft-driven lift fan concept and led to the development of the eventual JSF engine.

ASTOVL continued under the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF) program in 1993 before eventually being merged into the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST), which was renamed JSF in 1995; under the JSF program, contracts for flightworthy concept demonstrator aircraft were awarded in 1996 to Lockheed Martin and Boeing for the air vehicle designs and P&amp;W for the initial propulsion system. P&amp;W developed the JSF engine from their F119 turbofan, which powers the F-22 Raptor, as the &quot;F119-JSF&quot;. A flightworthy prototype system that incorporated the shaft-driven lift fan, designated &quot;YF119-PW-611&quot;, was tested on the Lockheed Martin X-35 concept demonstrator aircraft and first flew in 2000. P&amp;W also made another prototype, the &quot;YF119-PW-614&quot;, for the competing Boeing X-32 which had direct lift system. In flight tests, the X-35B was able to demonstrate STOVL by taking off in , then flew supersonic before landing vertically. The X-35 concept beat the X-32 for the JSF competition and the YF119-611 would form the basis for the F135, which integrates the F119 core with new components optimized for the JSF.

The F135 team is made up of Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls-Royce and Hamilton Sundstrand. Pratt &amp; Whitney is the prime contractor for the main engine, and systems integration. Rolls-Royce is responsible for the vertical lift system for the STOVL aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is responsible for the electronic engine control system, actuation system, PMAG, gearbox, and health monitoring systems. Woodward, Inc. is responsible for the fuel system. The F135 is assembled at a plant in Middletown, Connecticut. Some parts of the engine are made in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada, and in Poland. The first production propulsion system for operational service was scheduled for delivery in 2007 with the purpose of serving the U.S., UK, and other international customers. The initial F-35s went into production with the F135 engines, but the GE/Rolls-Royce team planned to develop a replacement F136 engine in July 2009. In 2010, the Pentagon planned for the two propulsion systems to be competitively tendered. However, since 2006 the Defense Department has not requested funding for the alternate F136 engine program, but Congress has maintained program funding.

As of 2009, P&amp;W developed a more durable version of the F135 engine to increase the service life of key parts. The life expectancy of the parts was reduced because the hot sections of the engine (combustor and high-pressure turbine blades specifically) ran hotter than expected. The test engine is designated &quot;XTE68/LF1&quot;, and testing is expected to begin in 2010. This redesign has caused &quot;substantial cost growth&quot;.

P&amp;W expected to deliver the F135 below the cost of the F119, even though it was a more powerful engine. However, in February 2013 a cracked turbine blade was found during a scheduled inspection. The crack was caused by operating at high turbine temperatures for longer periods than usual. In December 2013 the hollow first stage fan blisk failed at 77% of its expected life during a ground test. It was to be replaced by a solid part adding in weight. In 2013, a former P&amp;W employee was caught attempting to ship &quot;numerous boxes&quot; of sensitive information about the F135 to Iran.

Despite the troubles, the 100th engine was delivered in 2013. LRIP-6 was agreed in 2013 for $1.1 billion for 38 engines of various types, which helped to decrease the unit cost.

Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher C. Bogdan, the executive officer of the F-35 program, has called out P&amp;W for falling short on manufacturing quality of the engines and slow deliveries. His deputy director Rear Admiral Randy Mahr said that P&amp;W stopped their cost-cutting efforts after &quot;they got the monopoly&quot;. In 2013 the price of the F135 increased by $4.3 billion.

In May 2014, Pratt &amp; Whitney discovered conflicting documentation about the origin of titanium material used in some of its engines, including the F135. The company assessed that the uncertainty did not pose a risk to safety of flight but suspended engine deliveries as a result. Bogdan supported P&amp;W&#x27;s actions and said the problem was now with A&amp;P Alloys, the supplier. The US Defense Contract Management Agency wrote in June 2014 that Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s &quot;continued poor management of suppliers is a primary driver for the increased potential problem notifications.&quot; A&amp;P Alloys stated that they stood behind their product even though they were not given access to the parts to do their own testing. Tracy Miner, an attorney with Boston-based Demeo LLP representing A&amp;P Alloys said, &quot;it is blatantly unfair to destroy A&amp;P’s business without allowing A&amp;P access to the materials in question&quot;

In July 2014 there was an uncontained failure of a fan rotor while the aircraft was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before the flight, flexing of the engine caused excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the fan stator initiating the impending failure. The rub caused a temperature of over 1,000 °C (1,900 °F), well beyond the material limit of 540 °C (1,000 °F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured a fuel tank and hot air mixing with fuel caused the fire. As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a mating groove in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing.

Pratt &amp; Whitney managed to meet their 2015 production goals, but &quot;recurring manufacturing quality issues&quot; in turbine blades and electronic control systems required engines to be pulled from the fleet.

==Design==

Derived from the F119 engine, the F135 is a mixed-flow afterburning turbofan utilizing a similar core as the F119 with a new fan and LP turbine. There are two F135 variants: the -100 and the -600 versions. A -400 version is mentioned, similar to the -100, the main difference being the use of salt-corrosion resistant materials. The -600 is described below with an explanation of the engine configuration changes that take place for hovering. The engine and Rolls-Royce LiftSystem make up the Integrated Lift Fan Propulsion System (ILFPS).

The vertical thrust for the STOVL version is obtained from a two-stage lift fan (about 46%) in front of the engine, a vectoring exhaust nozzle (about 46%), and a nozzle in each wing using fan air from the bypass duct (about 8%). These contributions to the total lift are based on thrust values of , and respectively. Another source gives thrust values of , , and respectively.

In this configuration most of the bypass flow is ducted to the wing nozzles, known as roll posts. Some is used for cooling the rear exhaust nozzle, known as the 3-bearing swivel duct nozzle (3BSD). At the same time an auxiliary inlet is opened on top of the aircraft to provide additional air to the engine with low distortion during the hover.

The low pressure (LP) turbine drives the lift fan through a shaft extension on the front of the LP rotor and a clutch. The engine operates as a separate flow turbofan with a higher bypass ratio. The power to drive the fan—about —is obtained from the LP turbine by increasing the hot nozzle area.

A higher bypass ratio increases the thrust for the same engine power as a fundamental consequence of transferring power from a small diameter propelling jet to a larger diameter one. When the F135 is providing vertical lift using the increased bypass ratio from the lift fan, the thrust augmentation is 50% with no increase in fuel flow. Thrust augmentation is 52% in conventional flight when using the afterburner, but with a large increase in fuel flow.

The transfer of approximately of the power available for hot nozzle thrust to the lift fan reduces the temperature and velocity of the rear lift jet impinging on the ground. The F-35 can achieve a limited 100% throttle cruise without afterburners of Mach 1.2 for .

Like the F119, the F135 has a stealthy augmentor where traditional spray bars and flameholders are replaced by thick curved vanes coated with ceramic radar-absorbent materials (RAM). Afterburner fuel injectors are integrated into these vanes, which block line-of-sight of the turbines, contributing to aft-sector stealth. The axisymmetric nozzle consists of fifteen partially overlapping flaps that create a sawtooth pattern at the trailing edge. This creates shed vortices and reduces the infrared signature of the exhaust plume. The effectiveness is reportedly comparable to that of the F119&#x27;s wedge nozzles, while being substantially more cost effective and lower maintenance.

The engine uses thermoelectric-powered sensors to monitor turbine bearing health.

Improving engine reliability and ease of maintenance is a major objective for the F135. The engine has fewer parts than similar engines, which improves reliability. All line-replaceable components (LRCs) can be removed and replaced with a set of six common hand tools. The F135&#x27;s health management system is designed to provide real time data to maintainers on the ground. This allows them to troubleshoot problems and prepare replacement parts before the aircraft returns to base. According to Pratt &amp; Whitney, this data may help drastically reduce troubleshooting and replacement time, as much as 94% over legacy engines.

===Planned improvements===
Prior to any services issuing a requirement for an upgraded engine, Pratt and Whitney had cooperated with the US Navy on a two-block improvement plan for the F135 engine. The goals of Block 1 are a 7–10% increase in thrust and a 5–7% lower fuel burn. The plans include better cooling technology for turbine blades; this would increase the longevity of the engine and substantially reduce maintenance costs. The goal of Block 2 is to work with the US Air Force&#x27;s Adaptive Engine Transition Program, with the intention of introducing technology for an engine rated at 45,000 lb of thrust, to be used in a sixth-generation fighter.

Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s upgrade path for the F135 would change several times, with Block 1 and 2 initially becoming Growth Option 1 and 2. At the end of May 2017 Pratt and Whitney announced the F135 Growth Option 1 had finished testing and was available for production. The upgrade requires the changing of the power module on older engines during depot overhaul and can be seamlessly inserted into future production engines at a minimal increase in unit cost and no impact to delivery schedule. The Growth Option 1 offers an improvement of 6–10% thrust across the F-35 flight envelope while also getting a 5–6% fuel burn reduction. In June 2018, United Technologies, parent company of P&amp;W, announced Growth Option 2.0 to help provide increased power and thermal management system (PTMS) capacity, providing options for operators for instance if they are wishing to upgrade to heavier weapons. Although Growth Option 2.0 was initially envisaged as a further development of the F135 with an adaptive fan to become the XA101, a three-stream adaptive cycle engine, Pratt &amp; Whitney has since split the XA101 as an entirely separate design with a new core, while Growth Option 1.0 would evolve to become the F135 Engine Enhancement Package (EEP), later renamed Engine Core Upgrade (ECU). In 2023, the USAF chose to fund the ECU for further development and fielding by 2029 to support the F-35&#x27;s Block IV upgrade.

<text>Starsailor are an English post-Britpop band, formed in 2000. Since their formation, the band have included guitarist and vocalist James Walsh, drummer Ben Byrne, bassist James Stelfox, and keyboardist Barry Westhead. They are best known for their 2003 single &quot;Silence Is Easy&quot;, which reached number 9 in the UK, and &quot;Four to the Floor&quot;, which reached number one in France as well as the top five in Australia.

The band have released six studio albums and scored ten Top 40 hit singles in the UK. Their first album &quot;Love Is Here&quot; was released in 2001, followed by &quot;Silence Is Easy&quot; (2003) and &quot;On the Outside&quot; (2005). After the release of its fourth album &quot;All the Plans&quot; (2009), the band entered into extended hiatus until 2014, during which its members were involved in individual projects.

Starsailor announced their reunion on 23 May 2014 and began performing worldwide. &quot;Good Souls: The Greatest Hits&quot; was released in September 2015 and featured two new songs. A fifth studio album &quot;All This Life&quot; was released in 2017, followed by Where The Wild Things Grow in 2024.

==History==
===Formation, signed by EMI (1999–2000)===
Bassist James Stelfox and drummer Ben Byrne had been playing together in Warrington, Cheshire for a number of years. The band members met whilst studying a Music course at Wigan and Leigh College. When their regular singer fell ill, they recruited young Chorley singer and songwriter James Walsh from a school choir.

The band, then named Waterface, had tried a number of guitarists before they asked long-time friend Barry Westhead to join the band in 2000 on keyboards. He had been teaching judo and playing organ for a church near his home town. His arrival has been heralded as the most significant event in the band&#x27;s formation. Walsh also took up the guitar, following frustration over not finding a musician right for the group. The band started to build up a reputation, and their name changed to Starsailor after the 1970 album &quot;Starsailor&quot; by Tim Buckley.

A journalist from &quot;NME&quot; saw a gig in 2000 and gave the band a glowing review. &quot;One live encounter was enough to convince many sceptics that here was a band who were genuinely special, blessed with a singer whose voice thrummed like an emotional telegraph wire, that swerved the pitfalls of indie melancholia and were clearly in love with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and all its possibilities.&quot; Their performance at the Glastonbury Festival added to the band&#x27;s reputation and led to a bidding war amongst UK record companies.

A relative of one band member worked for EMI, and the label then signed them in 2000. In 2008, in a re-organisation, Starsailor were moved to Virgin Records, a division of EMI. 
=== &quot;Love Is Here&quot;, critical acclaim (2000–2002) ===
&quot;Fever&quot;, the band&#x27;s first single, was released in early 2001. The song, and its two B-Sides &quot;Love Is Here&quot; and &quot;Coming Down&quot; were cut from a demo recording session in mid-2000. All three tracks went on to feature on Starsailor&#x27;s first album &quot;Love Is Here&quot;, but were re-recorded.

In March 2001 the band sold out its first UK Tour, which consisted of eleven dates in England. Their second single, &quot;Good Souls&quot;, was released in April and featured a cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;The Way Young Lovers Do&quot; as a B-Side. During this period, the band were recording their debut album in Rockfield Studios, Wales. By this time, the band were already previewing many of the album&#x27;s tracks in their concerts, most notably &quot;Poor Misguided Fool&quot;, &quot;Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Way To Fall&quot;, which would appear as the ending theme of the video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; in 2004. An acoustic version of &quot;Alcoholic&quot; appeared on a promotional CD for &quot;NME&quot; magazine earlier in 2001. The original release date for the album was August 2001.

Further live dates came supporting the Manic Street Preachers in Glasgow, as well as Doves on their North American tour. The band also marked their first festival appearances, playing at events such as V Festival and Germany&#x27;s Rock im Park. &quot;Alcoholic&quot; appeared as the third single to be taken off their debut album, and its number ten chart position remains the band&#x27;s second highest placing to date. The single version was actually an extended version of the album track.

Their album &quot;Love Is Here&quot; reached number 2 in the UK album charts in October 2001, after receiving great critical acclaim. Combining a mix of acoustic guitar and Walsh&#x27;s vocals, critics said the songs leave the &quot;hairs on the back of your neck standing.&quot;

The year ended with the band winning the &quot;Brightest New Hope&quot; award at the NME Awards, and the release of their fourth single, &quot;Lullaby&quot;, which reached number thirty-six. Some fans complained about the difficulty in obtaining copies of the single.

Peter Kay joined the band on stage at their 2002 Christmas Concert held in Warrington&#x27;s Parr Hall.

===&quot;Silence Is Easy&quot; (2002–2005)===
For their second album, &quot;Silence Is Easy&quot;, which was recorded in Los Angeles, Starsailor teamed up with Phil Spector (in what ended up being his final production work before his conviction of murder in 2009 and his death in 2021). The collaboration came about following Spector&#x27;s daughter Nicole attending one of the band&#x27;s American concerts in the winter of 2002. Spector was reported to have been fascinated by &quot;Lullaby&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth single. After meeting the producer, the band agreed to work with him on their second album. However, the collaboration was short-lived; sessions at London&#x27;s Abbey Road proved difficult. Spector is said to have proved difficult to work with. Only two tracks made the band&#x27;s second album: the title track, &quot;Silence Is Easy&quot;, and &quot;White Dove&quot;.

The band co-produced seven of the other tracks with Danton Supple and former The Stone Roses and Radiohead producer John Leckie was brought in to oversee the recording of &quot;Shark Food&quot;.

The first single was &quot;Silence Is Easy&quot;, which made the Top Ten (No. 9, the band&#x27;s highest placing). The album spawned just three singles; the second of which, &quot;Born Again&quot; had evolved from a B-side to &quot;Poor Misguided Fool&quot;, released in early 2002. The song was re-recorded for the album, and cut down for a radio edit. &quot;Four to the Floor&quot;, which was remixed by Thin White Duke, became a popular club hit. Walsh wanted the track to become the band&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Resurrection&quot;, something to be played in &quot;indie discos everywhere&quot;.

The album charted well, but sales were sluggish in comparison to the band&#x27;s first album. The release dropped out of the Top 40 soon thereafter.

A full UK tour began in autumn 2003 shortly after the release of the album, culminating at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy. The show featured the only performance before their American tour in 2006 of &quot;Restless Heart&quot;, the closing track on the Silence Is Easy album. Mark Collins, from The Charlatans joined Starsailor for all dates between August 2003 to December 2004, playing additional and lead guitar.

===&quot;On the Outside&quot;, return to form (2005–2007)===
EMI allowed the band plenty of time to record their follow-up album; having targeted producer Rob Schnapf to produce it, the group relocated to Los Angeles to record. Five possible titles appeared; (&quot;Faith, Hope, Love&quot;/&quot;Here I Go&quot;/&quot;Ashes&quot; or &quot;In the Crossfire&quot;/&quot;I Do Not Know&quot;/&quot;Counterfeit Life&quot;), but the band settled for &quot;On the Outside&quot;, a statement of their position in the music industry. The sound was different from the previous two releases; it was far heavier than its predecessors. Starsailor had always received praise for their live sound, but the releases seemed &quot;puny&quot; in comparison, admitted Stelfox. The recording was all done to tape, and the band did not use editing software such as Pro Tools to &quot;perfect&quot; the recording. Byrne later remarked that his drum track on &quot;White Light&quot; took a long time to nail; highlighting the band&#x27;s desire to make the record they were truly happy with.

Starsailor released their third album, &quot;On the Outside&quot;, in the UK on 17 October 2005 from which the first single from the album, &quot;In the Crossfire&quot; was taken. It was released by Artists Addiction Records in the USA on 22 August. Critics raved about the release, with many citing it as a return to form. Despite this, promotional appearances including a short live set and signing at London&#x27;s HMV Oxford Street did not aid sales – the album charted at number 13.

Since September 2005, Richard Warren joined the band when playing live, aiding Walsh with additional guitar, vocals and also harmonica parts. Again, the band&#x27;s UK tour ended at Brixton Academy. Following that, the band toured Europe, playing several dates in France, where &quot;Four to the Floor&quot; was a number one hit in 2004. Following the Paris concert on 3 April, Walsh and Warren were the DJ&#x27;s at the after-show party.

The album has spawned three singles; &quot;This Time&quot; and &quot;Keep Us Together&quot; followed &quot;In The Crossfire&quot;. Despite promoting the single with appearances in London and Leeds, &quot;Keep Us Together&quot; was the first single not to reach the UK Top 40. The promotional video for &quot;This Time&quot; appears to be a cultural reference to the film &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, but may not be intentional.

Starsailor played numerous festivals in the Summer of 2006; most notably &quot;Hyde Park Calling&quot; on 1 July 2006, alongside Roger Waters, and the V Festival, which is held in Stafford and Chelmsford. They also supported the Rolling Stones on their &quot;Bigger Bang&quot; Tour in Munich, Hamburg in 2006 and again in Frankfurt, Paris and Lyon in 2007.

In the autumn of 2006, Starsailor toured North America, playing both headlining shows and supporting James Blunt, in January 2007 they undertook their first trip to Russia, playing in the B2 Club of Moscow. According to the band&#x27;s official website Barry Westhead&#x27;s partner Kelly gave birth to a baby boy on 12 April 2007. The baby was named Joseph. Bass player James Stelfox became a father again in 2008, when his partner gave birth to a girl, named Ella, in November while the rest of the band were doing their first trip to Korea.

Starsailor was named the replacement for Amy Winehouse as the support act for The Rolling Stones on the German leg of their tour. 
They were opening for the rock legends for the first time in Hamburg. Front man James Walsh told BBC 6 Music: &quot;We heard on Sunday evening, our agent gave us a frantic call, and asked what we were doing this week, fortunately we had a week off!&quot;

===&quot;All the Plans&quot;, beginning of hiatus (2007–2009)===
In 2007, Starsailor began recording demos for the follow-up to 2005&#x27;s &quot;On the Outside&quot;.

Starsailor started to play in various gigs during the months recording their fourth album. James Walsh also played at several events in 2007, like the SXSW festival in Texas in March 2007, and an acoustic show in London on 12 March. The show is notable for not having a set list; rarities such as the hardly played &quot;Restless Heart&quot; was played, due to a request from the front row. In addition to this he played the song &quot;Tell Me It&#x27;s Not Over&quot;, the track from the work-in-progress fourth album (early arrivals saw Walsh sound check half the song).

Walsh and Stelfox played an unplugged set on 13 April 2007 in Switzerland with Mark Collins of The Charlatans.

Further support in Europe for The Rolling Stones took place in mid-June; these were late additions, and fitted in with the band&#x27;s festival schedule. The previous concert before the Stones&#x27; support was in Den Haag, the Netherlands; the band debuted the first full-band version of &quot;Tell Me It&#x27;s Not Over&quot;. Starsailor had embarked on a tour of the UK during October 2007 in support of Fairtrade. They have debuted a number of new songs during the tour as &quot;Boy in Waiting&quot; and &quot;All the Plans&quot;. The lyrics for &quot;Tell Me It&#x27;s Not Over&quot; had changed considerably since the first time they had sung it. Their first travel to Latin America was confirmed after a long period of speculation. Starsailor supported The Killers in November 2007 on their dates in Argentina and Chile. Starsailor played on June at the Isle of Wight Festival on the last day, with The Police headlining on that date. They also performed at Hard Rock Calling in Hyde Park the same month with The Police as headliners. They also confirmed that they would play at &quot;Rockin&quot; Park&#x27; in the Netherlands on Saturday 28 June, on the third day of the 2008 Cactus Festival at Minnewaterpark, Brugge, Belgium on Saturday 12 July, and the Open Air Gampel Festival in Switzerland on Saturday 16 August.

On 20 March 2008, front man James posted on the official Starsailor forum announcing the album had been completed.

On 16 October 2008 it was officially confirmed that the new album would be called &quot;All the Plans&quot; and was to be released in March 2009.
On 3 December, the &quot;Boy in Waiting&quot; EP was released as a free digital download for those who pre-order the deluxe edition of &quot;All the Plans&quot;. It contained three tracks that did not make the album.

The album debuted at Number 26 in the UK Album Charts on 14 March 2009, while &quot;Tell Me It&#x27;s Not Over&quot; spent one week in the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 73, and peaking at No. 5 in the Belgian Charts, becoming Starsailor&#x27;s most successful single in that country.

On 26 April 2009, the band performed at The Tavern pub in Wigan, as part of Channel 4 television&#x27;s &quot;Grassroot Gigs&quot; series. They had never played a concert in the town before, and have played there only once since then.

Lead singer, James Walsh began to work on a solo project at the end of 2009. On 13 November 2009 it was officially announced by &quot;The Lancashire Evening Post&quot; that Starsailor was on hold and that James Walsh was concentrating on his solo career.

===Reunion, touring and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album (2014–2015)===
Starsailor have reformed, playing support slots at Summer in the City festival in 10 and 11 July at Castlefield Bowl, headlined by Pixies and James. Starsailor performed on Rock Zottegem festival in Belgium on 14 July 2014. On 3 August 2014 the band performed at the Pentaport Rock Festival held in Incheon, South Korea. Their support tour continued in November 2014, supporting them in England at venues like Parr Hall, National Indoor Arena and Royal Albert Hall. They returned to the stage in June 2015, when they co-headlined several concerts with Embrace in the USA.

Starsailor&#x27;s first greatest hits album, called &quot;Good Souls: The Greatest Hits&quot;, was released on 18 September 2015. The album contained 19 tracks, including all of band&#x27;s singles to date and two brand new songs &quot;Give Up the Ghost&quot; and &quot;Hold on&quot;, recorded with producer Harry Rutherford.

Starsailor played a second gig in Wigan in 2016, supported by a local band who shared the same management agency.

=== &quot;All This Life&quot; (2017–present) ===
In 2017, the band released &quot;Listen To Your Heart&quot;, their first release in almost two years. Their fifth album, &quot;All This Life&quot;, was released on 1 September 2017 through the band&#x27;s new record label, Cooking Vinyl. Flick of the Finger gave the album an overwhelmingly positive 5 star review, with the publication praising the song &quot;Sunday Best&quot;, saying that &#x27;the album is best summarised by this one melancholic and emotional track.&#x27; The album entered the UK album chart at No. 23.

In December 2021, the band were to release an expanded 20th anniversary edition of their album Love Is Here, as well as going out on tour to support it. The release was delayed until January 2022 due to pressing delays of the vinyl edition. Due to a partial cancelation due to COVID-19, the band were eventually able to complete their delayed tour in September 2022, and gave a live debut to a new song recorded earlier in the year entitled Heavyweight.

October 2023 saw the band announce details of their sixth studio album, entitled Where The Wild Things Grow, with a release date of March 2024. A video for the title track was also released at the same time. In November 2023, Starsailor released a 20th anniversary of their album Silence Is Easy alongside a tour to promote the re-issue. Where The Wild Things Grow was released on 22 March 2024, charting at No. 25.

==Charity==
The band played the London Astoria on 4 and 8 February 2002. The first date was a concert in aid of Warchild, and also included Travis and Ryan Adams on the bill. The 8th saw the debut of &quot;Born Again&quot;, which would eventually be released as a single. The concert is notable since the band were joined on stage by two backing singers and a cellist. James Walsh told NME.COM after the show that he thought the gig was &quot;amazing, something really special&quot; while bassist James Stelfox said it was &quot;one of the greatest ever.&quot; This flirtation with these additional voices and a cello only lasted a brief period of time.

On 19 September 2008 Starsailor performed in the second edition of the &quot;Stars of Europe&quot; concert at Brussels in support of UNICEF, where they covered U2&#x27;s single &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;

On 20 May 2009, the band was named Hard Rock&#x27;s &quot;Philanthropic Artist of the Year&quot; in recognition of the work they&#x27;d done in support of the Caron Keating Foundation, the AECC of Barcelona and Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy, as well as having contributed an exclusive cover of Graham Nash&#x27;s &quot;Military Madness&quot; to the World Hunger Year Serve3 charity album.

<text>In mathematics, E8 is any of several closely related exceptional simple Lie groups, linear algebraic groups or Lie algebras of dimension 248; the same notation is used for the corresponding root lattice, which has rank 8. The designation E8 comes from the Cartan–Killing classification of the complex simple Lie algebras, which fall into four infinite series labeled A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot;, D&quot;n&quot;, and five exceptional cases labeled G2, F4, E6, E7, and E8. The E8 algebra is the largest and most complicated of these exceptional cases.

== Basic description ==
The Lie group E8 has dimension 248. Its rank, which is the dimension of its maximal torus, is eight.

Therefore, the vectors of the root system are in eight-dimensional Euclidean space: they are described explicitly later in this article. The Weyl group of E8, which is the group of symmetries of the maximal torus that are induced by conjugations in the whole group, has order 2357 = .

The compact group E8 is unique among simple compact Lie groups in that its non-trivial representation of smallest dimension is the adjoint representation (of dimension 248) acting on the Lie algebra E8 itself; it is also the unique one that has the following four properties: trivial center, compact, simply connected, and simply laced (all roots have the same length).

There is a Lie algebra E&quot;k&quot; for every integer &quot;k&quot; ≥ 3. The largest value of &quot;k&quot; for which E&quot;k&quot; is finite-dimensional is &quot;k&quot; = 8, that is, E&quot;k&quot; is infinite-dimensional for any &quot;k&quot; &gt; 8.

== Real and complex forms ==
There is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E8, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 248. The complex Lie group E8 of complex dimension 248 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 496. This is simply connected, has maximal compact subgroup the compact form (see below) of E8, and has an outer automorphism group of order 2 generated by complex conjugation.

As well as the complex Lie group of type E8, there are three real forms of the Lie algebra, three real forms of the group with trivial center (two of which have non-algebraic double covers, giving two further real forms), all of real dimension 248, as follows:

* The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which is simply connected and has trivial outer automorphism group.
* The split form, EVIII (or E8(8)), which has maximal compact subgroup Spin(16)/(Z/2Z), fundamental group of order 2 (implying that it has a double cover, which is a simply connected Lie real group but is not algebraic, see below) and has trivial outer automorphism group.
* EIX (or E8(−24)), which has maximal compact subgroup E7 × SU(2)/(−1,−1), fundamental group of order 2 (again implying a double cover, which is not algebraic) and has trivial outer automorphism group.

For a complete list of real forms of simple Lie algebras, see the list of simple Lie groups.

== E8 as an algebraic group ==
By means of a Chevalley basis for the Lie algebra, one can define E8 as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as &quot;untwisted&quot;) form of E8. Over an algebraically closed field, this is the only form; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or &quot;twists&quot; of E8, which are classified in the general framework of Galois cohomology (over a perfect field &quot;k&quot;) by the set H1(&quot;k&quot;,Aut(E8)), which, because the Dynkin diagram of E8 (see below) has no automorphisms, coincides with H1(&quot;k&quot;,E8).

Over R, the real connected component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E8 coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned above, but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all forms of E8 are simply connected in the sense of algebraic geometry, meaning that they admit no non-trivial algebraic coverings; the non-compact and simply connected real Lie group forms of E8 are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations.

Over finite fields, the Lang–Steinberg theorem implies that H1(&quot;k&quot;,E8) = 0, meaning that E8 has no twisted forms: see below.

The characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the Weyl character formula. The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are :
: 1, 248, 3875, 27000, 30380, 147250, 779247, 1763125, 2450240, 4096000, 4881384, 6696000, 26411008, 70680000, 76271625, 79143000, 146325270, 203205000, 281545875, 301694976, 344452500, 820260000, 1094951000, 2172667860, 2275896000, 2642777280, 2903770000, 3929713760, 4076399250, 4825673125, 6899079264, 8634368000 (twice), 12692520960...

The 248-dimensional representation is the adjoint representation. There are two non-isomorphic irreducible representations of dimension 8634368000 (it is not unique; however, the next integer with this property is 175898504162692612600853299200000 ). The fundamental representations are those with dimensions 3875, 6696000, 6899079264, 146325270, 2450240, 30380, 248 and 147250 (corresponding to the eight nodes in the Dynkin diagram in the order chosen for the Cartan matrix below, i.e., the nodes are read in the seven-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the third).

The coefficients of the character formulas for infinite dimensional irreducible representations of E8 depend on some large square matrices consisting of polynomials, the Lusztig–Vogan polynomials, an analogue of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials introduced for reductive groups in general by George Lusztig and David Kazhdan (1983). The values at 1 of the Lusztig–Vogan polynomials give the coefficients of the matrices relating the standard representations (whose characters are easy to describe) with the irreducible representations.

These matrices were computed after four years of collaboration by a group of 18 mathematicians and computer scientists, led by Jeffrey Adams, with much of the programming done by Fokko du Cloux. The most difficult case (for exceptional groups) is the split real form of E8 (see above), where the largest matrix is of size 453060×453060. The Lusztig–Vogan polynomials for all other exceptional simple groups have been known for some time; the calculation for the split form of &quot;E&quot;8 is far longer than any other case. The announcement of the result in March 2007 received extraordinary attention from the media (see the external links), to the surprise of the mathematicians working on it.

The representations of the E8 groups over finite fields are given by Deligne–Lusztig theory.

== Constructions ==
One can construct the (compact form of the) E8 group as the automorphism group of the corresponding e8 Lie algebra. This algebra has a 120-dimensional subalgebra so(16) generated by &quot;J&quot;&quot;ij&quot; as well as 128 new generators &quot;Q&quot;&quot;a&quot; that transform as a Weyl–Majorana spinor of spin(16). These statements determine the commutators
: formula_1
as well as
: formula_2
while the remaining commutators (not anticommutators!) between the spinor generators are defined as
: formula_3

It is then possible to check that the Jacobi identity is satisfied.

== Geometry ==
The compact real form of E8 is the isometry group of the 128-dimensional exceptional compact Riemannian symmetric space EVIII (in Cartan&#x27;s classification). It is known informally as the &quot;octooctonionic projective plane&quot; because it can be built using an algebra that is the tensor product of the octonions with themselves, and is also known as a Rosenfeld projective plane, though it does not obey the usual axioms of a projective plane. This can be seen systematically using a construction known as the &quot;magic square&quot;, due to Hans Freudenthal and Jacques Tits .

== E8 root system ==

A root system of rank &quot;r&quot; is a particular finite configuration of vectors, called &quot;roots&quot;, which span an &quot;r&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space and satisfy certain geometrical properties. In particular, the root system must be invariant under reflection through the hyperplane perpendicular to any root.

The E8 root system is a rank 8 root system containing 240 root vectors spanning R8. It is irreducible in the sense that it cannot be built from root systems of smaller rank. All the root vectors in E8 have the same length. It is convenient for a number of purposes to normalize them to have length . These 240 vectors are the vertices of a semi-regular polytope discovered by Thorold Gosset in 1900, sometimes known as the 421 polytope.

=== Construction ===
In the so-called &quot;even coordinate system&quot;, E8 is given as the set of all vectors in R8 with length squared equal to 2 such that coordinates are either all integers or all half-integers and the sum of the coordinates is even.

Explicitly, there are 112 roots with integer entries obtained from
: formula_4

by taking an arbitrary combination of signs and an arbitrary permutation of coordinates, and 128 roots with half-integer entries obtained from
: formula_5

by taking an even number of minus signs (or, equivalently, requiring that the sum of all the eight coordinates be even). There are 240 roots in all.

The 112 roots with integer entries form a D8 root system. The E8 root system also contains a copy of A8 (which has 72 roots) as well as E6 and E7 (in fact, the latter two are usually &quot;defined&quot; as subsets of E8).

In the &quot;odd coordinate system&quot;, E8 is given by taking the roots in the even coordinate system and changing the sign of any one coordinate. The roots with integer entries are the same while those with half-integer entries have an odd number of minus signs rather than an even number.

=== Dynkin diagram ===
The Dynkin diagram for E8 is given by .

This diagram gives a concise visual summary of the root structure. Each node of this diagram represents a simple root. A line joining two simple roots indicates that they are at an angle of 120° to each other. Two simple roots that are not joined by a line are orthogonal.

=== Cartan matrix ===
The Cartan matrix of a rank root system is an matrix whose entries are derived from the simple roots. Specifically, the entries of the Cartan matrix are given by
: formula_6
where is the Euclidean inner product and are the simple roots. The entries are independent of the choice of simple roots (up to ordering).

The Cartan matrix for E8 is given by
: formula_7
The determinant of this matrix is equal to 1.

=== Simple roots ===
A set of simple roots for a root system Φ is a set of roots that form a basis for the Euclidean space spanned by Φ with the special property that each root has components with respect to this basis that are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive.

Given the E8 Cartan matrix (above) and a Dynkin diagram node ordering of: 

One choice of simple roots is given by the rows of the following matrix:
: formula_8

With this numbering of nodes in the Dynkin diagram, the highest root in the root system has Coxeter labels (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 2, 3). Using this representation of the simple roots, the lowest root is given by
: formula_9
The only simple root that can be added to the lowest root to obtain another root is the one corresponding to node 1 in this labeling of the Dynkin diagram — as is to be expected from the affine Dynkin diagram for formula_10. The Hasse diagram to the right enumerates the 120 roots of positive height relative to any particular choice of simple roots consistent with this node numbering.

Note that the Hasse diagram does not represent the full Lie algebra, or even the full root system. The 120 roots of negative height relative to the same set of simple roots can be adequately represented by a second copy of the Hasse diagram with the arrows reversed; but it is less straightforward to connect these two diagrams via a basis for the eight-dimensional Cartan subalgebra. In the notation of the exposition of Chevalley generators and Serre relations: Insofar as an arrow represents the Lie bracket by the generator formula_11 associated with a simple root, each root in the height -1 layer of the reversed Hasse diagram must correspond to some formula_12 and can have only one upward arrow, connected to a node in the height 0 layer representing the element of the Cartan subalgebra given by formula_13. But the upward arrows from the height 0 layer must then represent formula_14, where formula_15 is (the transpose of) the Cartan matrix. One could draw multiple upward arrows from each formula_16 associated with all formula_11 for which formula_18 is nonzero; but this neither captures the numerical entries in the Cartan matrix nor reflects the fact that each formula_11 only has nonzero Lie bracket with one degree of freedom in the Cartan subalgebra (just not the same degree of freedom as formula_20).

More fundamentally, this organization implies that the &quot;span&quot; of the generators designated as &quot;the&quot; Cartan subalgebra is somehow inherently special, when in most applications, any mutually commuting set of eight of the 248 Lie algebra generators (of which there are many!) — or any eight linearly independent, mutually commuting Lie derivations on any manifold with E8 structure — would have served just as well. Once a Cartan subalgebra has been selected (or defined &quot;a priori&quot;, as in the case of a lattice), a basis of &quot;Cartan generators&quot; (the formula_20 among the Chevalley generators) and a root system are a useful way to describe structure &quot;relative to this subalgebra&quot;. But the root system map is not the Lie algebra (let alone group!) territory. Given a set of Chevalley generators, most degrees of freedom in a Lie algebra and their sparse Lie brackets with formula_22 can be represented schematically as circles and arrows, but this simply breaks down on the chosen Cartan subalgebra. Such are the hazards of schematic visual representations of mathematical structures.

=== Weyl group ===
The Weyl group of E8 is of order 696729600, and can be described as O(2): it is of the form 2.&quot;G&quot;.2 (that is, a stem extension by the cyclic group of order 2 of an extension of the cyclic group of order 2 by a group &quot;G&quot;) where &quot;G&quot; is the unique simple group of order 174182400 (which can be described as PSΩ8+(2)).

=== E8 root lattice ===
The integral span of the E8 root system forms a lattice in R8 naturally called the E8 root lattice. This lattice is rather remarkable in that it is the only (nontrivial) even, unimodular lattice with rank less than 16.

=== Simple subalgebras of E8 ===
The Lie algebra E8 contains as subalgebras all the exceptional Lie algebras as well as many other important Lie algebras in mathematics and physics. The height of the Lie algebra on the diagram approximately corresponds to the rank of the algebra. A line from an algebra down to a lower algebra indicates that the lower algebra is a subalgebra of the higher algebra.

== Chevalley groups of type E8 ==
 showed that the points of the (split) algebraic group E8 (see above) over a finite field with &quot;q&quot; elements form a finite Chevalley group, generally written E8(&quot;q&quot;), which is simple for any &quot;q&quot;, and constitutes one of the infinite families addressed by the classification of finite simple groups. Its number of elements is given by the formula :

The first term in this sequence, the order of E8(2), namely ≈ , is already larger than the size of the Monster group. This group E8(2) is the last one described (but without its character table) in the ATLAS of Finite Groups.

The Schur multiplier of E8(&quot;q&quot;) is trivial, and its outer automorphism group is that of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order &quot;f&quot; if , where &quot;p&quot; is prime).

 described the unipotent representations of finite groups of type &quot;E&quot;8.

== Subgroups, subalgebras, and extensions ==
The smaller exceptional groups E7 and E6 sit inside E8. In the compact group, both E6×SU(3)/(Z/3Z) and E7×SU(2)/(+1,−1) are maximal subgroups of E8.

The 248-dimensional adjoint representation of E8 may be considered in terms of its restricted representation to the first of these subgroups. It transforms under E6×SU(3) as a sum of tensor product representations, which may be labelled as a pair of dimensions as (78,1) + (1,8) + (,3) + (27,). (Since the maximal subgroup is actually the quotient of this group product by a finite group, these notations may strictly be taken as indicating the infinitesimal (Lie algebra) representations.) Since the adjoint representation can be described by the roots together with the generators in the Cartan subalgebra, we may choose a particular E6 root system within E8 and decompose the sum representation relative to this E6. In this description,
* (78,1), a copy of formula_24, consists of the 72 roots with (−,−,−), (0,0,0), or (,) in the last three dimensions, together with five Cartan generators corresponding to the first five dimensions and one Cartan generator corresponding to an equally weighted sum of the last three Cartan generators of the E8 system;
* (1,8), a copy of formula_25, consists of the six roots with permutations of (0,1,−1) in the last three dimensions, together with two Cartan generators corresponding to the two trace-free combinations of the last three Cartan generators of the E8 system;
* (27,3) consists of all roots with permutations of (-1,0,0), (−,), or (0,1,1) in the last three dimensions; and
* (27,3) consists of all roots with permutations of (1,0,0), (,−,−), or (0,-1,-1) in the last three dimensions.

The 248-dimensional adjoint representation of E8, when similarly restricted to the second maximal subgroup, transforms under E7×SU(2) as: (133,1) + (1,3) + (56,2). We may again see the decomposition by looking at the roots together with the generators in the Cartan subalgebra. In this description,
* (133,1), a copy of formula_26, consists of the 126 roots with (−1,−1), (−,−), (0,0), (,), or (1,1) in the last two dimensions, together with six Cartan generators corresponding to the first six dimensions and one Cartan generator corresponding to an equally weighted sum of the last two Cartan generators of the E8 system;
* (1,3), a copy of formula_27, consists of the two roots (0,0,0,0,0,0,1,−1), (0,0,0,0,0,0,−1,1), together with one Cartan generator corresponding to the trace-free combination of the last two Cartan generators of the E8 system; and
* (56,2) consists of all roots with permutations of (0,-1), (,−), or (1,0) in the last two dimensions.

The connection between these two descriptions is given by the graded exceptional Lie algebra constructions of J. Tits and B. N. Allison. Any 27-dimensional representation of E6 can be equipped with a non-associative (but strictly power-associative) Jordan product operation to form an Albert algebra (an important exceptional case in algebraic constructions). The Kantor–Koecher–Tits construction applied to this Albert algebra recovers the 78-dimensional formula_24 as the reduced structure algebra of the Albert algebra. This formula_24, together with the 27 and 27 representations and the grade operator (the element of the Cartan subalgebra with weight -1 on the 27, +1 on the 27, and 0 on the 78), forms an formula_26 3-graded Lie algebra. A complete exposition of this construction may be found in standard texts on Jordan algebras such as Jacobson 1968 or McCrimmon 2004.

Starting this 3-graded Lie algebra construction with any particular 27-dimensional representation, embedded within formula_31, of any particular E6 subgroup of E8 produces the corresponding formula_26 subalgebra. The particular formula_26 in the E7×SU(2) decomposition given above corresponds to choosing the 27 consisting of all roots with (1,0,0), (,-,-), or (0,-1,-1) in the last three dimensions (in order), with the grade operator having weight (-1,) in these dimensions; or equivalently to choosing the &quot;27&quot; consisting of all roots with (-1,0,0), (−,), or (0,1,1) in the last three dimensions (in order), with the grade operator having weight (1,-,-) in these dimensions. Note that there is nothing special about this choice of dimensions — the formula_34 within which the root system is embedded is not the set of eight independent but non-orthogonal axes corresponding to the simple roots, and any three dimensions will do — and there are also constructions using other equivalent groupings of roots. What matters is that the kernel of the Lie bracket with the generator chosen as the &quot;grade operator&quot; be an formula_24 subalgebra (plus a central formula_36 associated with the grade operator itself and the remaining generator of the Cartan subalgebra), not formula_37, formula_38, formula_39, &quot;etc.&quot;

(In the simple Lie algebra case, the sign of the grade of the 27 versus the 27 representation is a matter of convention, as is the scale of the grading. However, choosing -1 as the grade of the 27-dimensional &quot;vector&quot; representation is consistent with an extension of the 3-graded algebra to higher positive grades via the exterior algebra over the 27 &quot;covector&quot; representation. The &quot;vector&quot; representation then lies, not in this nonnegative-graded exterior algebra, but in the graded algebra of derivations over the exterior algebra; the 78-dimensional formula_24 is the grade 0 subalgebra (a subalgebra of the inner derivations by &quot;vector-valued 1-forms&quot;) of this graded algebra of derivations. For details on how this asymmetric structure works starting from a general 3-graded algebra, see references at Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket. The relevance of this observation to E8 is simply that E7 and E8 are their own clusters of structures, distinguished as exceptional simple Lie groups/algebras, and that any particular reconstruction of them using representations of their subgroups/subalgebras will have extensions beyond the motivating case. Varying conventions of sign, scale, and conjugate relationship in the literature are due not just to inaccuracies but also to the directions in which the authors seek to extend their constructions.)

The distinguished formula_27 in the E7×SU(2) decomposition above is then given by the subalgebra of formula_25 that commutes with the grade operator (which lies in the Cartan subalgebra of this formula_25). Of the four remaining roots in the formula_25, two are of grade and two are of grade -. In the convention where the 27 of E6 used to construct the formula_26 has grade -1 and the 27 has grade +1, the other two 27&#x27;s have grade + and the other two 27&#x27;s have grade -, as is apparent from permuting the values of the last three roots in the description above. Grouping these 4×(1+27)=112 generators to form the grade + and - subspaces of formula_31 (relative to the original choice of grade operator within formula_26), each subspace may be given a quite particular non-associative (nor even power-associative) product operation, resulting in two copies of Brown&#x27;s 56-dimensional structurable algebra. Allison&#x27;s 5-graded Lie algebra construction based on this structurable algebra recovers the original formula_31. (Allison&#x27;s 5-grading differs from the above by a factor -2.) Grouping these generators differently, based on their weights relative to the Cartan generator of the formula_27 &quot;orthogonal&quot; to formula_26, gives two 56-dimensional subspaces that each carry the lowest-dimensional non-trivial irreducible representation of E7. Either of these may be combined with the Cartan generator to form a 57-dimensional Heisenberg algebra, and adjoining this to formula_26 produces the (non-simple) Lie algebra E7 1/2 described by Landsberg and Manivel.

From the perspective in which the 27-dimensional grade -1 subspace of formula_31 (relative to a choice of grade operator) plays the role of &quot;vector&quot; representation of E6 and the 27 with roots opposite it plays the role of &quot;covector&quot; representation, it is natural to look for &quot;spinor&quot; representations in the grade + and - subspaces, or in some other combination of the (27,3) and (27,3) representations of E6×SU(3), and to attempt to relate these to geometrical spinors in the Clifford algebra sense as employed in quantum field theory. Variations on this idea are common in the physics literature. See Distler and Garibaldi 2009 for discussion of the mathematical obstacles to constructing a &quot;chiral&quot; gauge theory based on E8. The structure of formula_31 relative to its formula_24 subalgebra, together with the conventional scaling of elements of the Cartan subalgebra, invites extensions by geometric analogy but does not necessarily imply a relationship to low-dimensional geometry or low-energy physics. The same may be said of connections to Jordan and Heisenberg algebras, whose historical origins are intertwined with the development of quantum mechanics. Not every visual representation evocative of a tobacco pipe will hold tobacco.

The finite quasisimple groups that can embed in (the compact form of) E8 were found by .

The Dempwolff group is a subgroup of (the compact form of) E8. It is contained in the Thompson sporadic group, which acts on the underlying vector space of the Lie group E8 but does not preserve the Lie bracket. The Thompson group fixes a lattice and does preserve the Lie bracket of this lattice mod 3, giving an embedding of the Thompson group into E8(F3).

The embeddings of the maximal subgroups of E8 up to dimension 248 are shown to the right.

== Applications ==
The E8 Lie group has applications in theoretical physics and especially in string theory and supergravity. E8×E8 is the gauge group of one of the two types of heterotic string and is one of two anomaly-free gauge groups that can be coupled to the &quot;N&quot; = 1 supergravity in ten dimensions. E8 is the U-duality group of supergravity on an eight-torus (in its split form).

One way to incorporate the standard model of particle physics into heterotic string theory is the symmetry breaking of E8 to its maximal subalgebra SU(3)×E6.

In 1982, Michael Freedman used the E8 lattice to construct an example of a topological 4-manifold, the E8 manifold, which has no smooth structure.

Antony Garrett Lisi&#x27;s incomplete &quot;An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything&quot; attempts to describe all known fundamental interactions in physics as part of the E8 Lie algebra.

 reported an experiment where the electron spins of a cobalt-niobium crystal exhibited, under certain conditions, two of the eight peaks related to E8 that were predicted by .

== History ==
 discovered the complex Lie algebra E8 during his classification of simple compact Lie algebras, though he did not prove its existence, which was first shown by Élie Cartan. Cartan determined that a complex simple Lie algebra of type E8 admits three real forms. Each of them gives rise to a simple Lie group of dimension 248, exactly one of which (as for any complex simple Lie algebra) is compact. introduced algebraic groups and Lie algebras of type E8 over other fields: for example, in the case of finite fields they lead to an infinite family of finite simple groups of Lie type. E8 continues to be an area of active basic research by Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations, which aims to determine the unitary representations of all the Lie groups.

<doc id="648004" wikidata="Q2993323" url="?curid=648004" title="Hilbert–Pólya conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture states that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function correspond to eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator. It is a possible approach to the Riemann hypothesis, by means of spectral theory.

==History==
In a letter to Andrew Odlyzko, dated January 3, 1982, George Pólya
said that while he was in Göttingen around 1912 to 1914 he was asked by Edmund Landau for a physical reason that the Riemann hypothesis should be true, and suggested that this would be the case if the imaginary parts &quot;t&quot; of the zeros
:formula_1
of the Riemann zeta function corresponded to eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator. The earliest published statement of the conjecture seems to be in .

David Hilbert did not work in the central areas of analytic number theory, but his name has become known for the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture due to a story told by Ernst Hellinger, a student of Hilbert, to André Weil. Hellinger said that Hilbert announced in his seminar in the early 1900s that he expected the Riemann Hypothesis would be a consequence of Fredholm&#x27;s work on integral equations with a symmetric kernel.

===1950s and the Selberg trace formula===

At the time of Pólya&#x27;s conversation with Landau, there was little basis for such speculation. However Selberg in the early 1950s proved a duality between the length spectrum of a Riemann surface and the eigenvalues of its Laplacian. This so-called Selberg trace formula bore a striking resemblance to the explicit formulae, which gave credibility to the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture.

===1970s and random matrices===

Hugh Montgomery investigated and found that the statistical distribution of the zeros on the critical line has a certain property, now called Montgomery&#x27;s pair correlation conjecture. The zeros tend not to cluster too closely together, but to repel. Visiting at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1972, he showed this result to Freeman Dyson, one of the founders of the theory of random matrices.

Dyson saw that the statistical distribution found by Montgomery appeared to be the same as the pair correlation distribution for the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix. These distributions are of importance in physics — the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian, for example the energy levels of an atomic nucleus, satisfy such statistics. Subsequent work has strongly borne out the connection between the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble, and both are now believed to obey the same statistics. Thus the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture now has a more solid basis, though it has not yet led to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis.

===Later developments===

In 1998, Alain Connes formulated a trace formula that is actually equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. This strengthened the analogy with the Selberg trace formula to the point where it gives precise statements. He gives a geometric interpretation of the explicit formula of number theory as a trace formula on noncommutative geometry of Adele classes.

==Possible connection with quantum mechanics==

A possible connection of Hilbert–Pólya operator with quantum mechanics was given by Pólya. The Hilbert–Pólya conjecture operator is of the form formula_2 where formula_3 is the Hamiltonian of a particle of mass formula_4 that is moving under the influence of a potential formula_5. The Riemann conjecture is equivalent to the assertion that the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, or equivalently that formula_6 is real.

Using perturbation theory to first order, the energy of the &quot;n&quot;th eigenstate is related to the expectation value of the potential:

:formula_7

where formula_8 and formula_9 are the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the free particle Hamiltonian. This equation can be taken to be a Fredholm integral equation of first kind, with the energies formula_10. Such integral equations may be solved by means of the resolvent kernel, so that the potential may be written as

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the resolvent kernel, formula_13 is a real constant and

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the Dirac delta function, and the formula_16 are the &quot;non-trivial&quot; roots of the zeta function formula_17.

Michael Berry and Jonathan Keating have speculated that the Hamiltonian &quot;H&quot; is actually some quantization of the classical Hamiltonian &quot;xp&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; is the canonical momentum associated with &quot;x&quot; The simplest Hermitian operator corresponding to &quot;xp&quot; is
:formula_18
This refinement of the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture is known as the &quot;Berry conjecture&quot; (or the &quot;Berry–Keating conjecture&quot;). As of 2008, it is still quite far from being concrete, as it is not clear on which space this operator should act in order to get the correct dynamics, nor how to regularize it in order to get the expected logarithmic corrections. Berry and Keating have conjectured that since this operator is invariant under dilations perhaps the boundary condition &quot;f&quot;(&quot;nx&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for integer &quot;n&quot; may help to get the correct asymptotic results valid for large &quot;n&quot;
:formula_19

A paper was published in March 2017, written by Carl M. Bender, Dorje C. Brody, and Markus P. Müller, which builds on Berry&#x27;s approach to the problem. There the operator

:formula_20

was introduced, which they claim satisfies a certain modified versions of the conditions of the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture. Jean Bellissard has criticized this paper, and the authors have responded with clarifications. Moreover, Frederick Moxley has approached the problem with a Schrödinger equation.

<text>A die is a specialized machine tool used in manufacturing industries to cut and/or form material to a desired shape or profile. &quot;Stamping dies&quot; are used with a press, as opposed to &quot;drawing dies&quot; (used in the manufacture of wire) and &quot;casting dies&quot; (used in molding) which are not. Like molds, dies are generally customized to the item they are used to create.

Products made with dies range from simple paper clips to complex pieces used in advanced technology. Continuous-feed laser cutting may displace the analogous die-based process in the automotive industry, among others.

==Die stamping==

Blanking and piercing are two die cutting operations, and bending is an example of a die forming operation.

===Die forming===
Forming operations work by deforming materials like sheet metal or plastic using force (compression, tension, or both) and rely on the material&#x27;s mechanical properties. Forming dies are typically made by tool and die makers and put into production after mounting into a press.

===Differences between materials===
For the vacuum forming of plastic sheet only a single form is used, typically to form transparent plastic containers (called blister packs) for merchandise. Vacuum forming is considered a simple molding thermoforming process but uses the same principles as die forming.

For the forming of sheet metal, such as automobile body parts, two parts may be used: one, called the &quot;punch&quot;, performs the stretching, bending, and/or blanking operation, while another part that is called the &quot;die block&quot; securely clamps the workpiece and provides a similar stretching, bending, and/or blanking operation. The workpiece may pass through several stages using different tools or operations to obtain the final form. In the case of an automotive component, there will usually be a shearing operation after the main forming is done. Additional crimping or rolling operations may be performed to ensure that all sharp edges are hidden and/or to add rigidity to the panel.

==Die components==
The main components of a die set (including press mounting) are as follows. Because nomenclature varies between sources, alternate names are in parentheses:

* Die shoes (holders) – the set of flat, parallel plates that serve as the foundation for mounting die components.
* Guide pins (pillars) – together with guide bushings, the pins align the die shoes precisely during each press stroke.
*Die set (plates). Placement can be inverted depending on the operation, such as use of a knock-out:
** Die block – the lower (bottom) half of the die set. Machined to conform to the desired shape of the workpiece being formed or cut.
**Punch plate – the upper (top) half of the die set. Holds and supports the different punches in place.
*Punch – male portion of the die which punches through the sheet metal and into the corresponding (female) section of the die block. More specifically: 
**Blanking punch – performs a dual-purpose operation where either a profiled slug, called the blank, is cut out and used for further working, or where a finished piece is cut free from the sheet metal.
**Pierce punch – cuts a desired shape (circular, polygonal, etc.) out of the workpiece. The slug is discarded.
*Stripper plate (pad) – spring-loaded plate that separates (i.e., strips) the workpiece from the withdrawing punch after each press stroke.
*Pilot – This will help to place the sheet accurately for the next stage of operation.
*Stock guide – ensures that the material being worked on always goes in the same position, within the die, as the last one.
*Setting (stop) block – This part is used to control the depth that the punch goes into the die.
*Shank – installs the punch plate to the press. It should be aligned and situated at the center of gravity of the plate.

==Process==
*Blanking: A blanking die produces a flat piece of material by cutting the desired shape in one operation. The finished part is referred to as a blank. Generally a blanking die may only cut the outside contour of a part, often used for parts with no internal features.&lt;br&gt;Three benefits to die blanking are:
#&quot;Accuracy&quot;. A properly sharpened die, with the correct amount of clearance between the punch and die, will produce a part that holds close dimensional tolerances in relationship to the part&#x27;s edges.
#&quot;Appearance&quot;. Since the part is blanked in one operation, the finish edges of the part produces a uniform appearance as opposed to varying degrees of burnishing from multiple operations.
#&quot;Flatness&quot;. Due to the even compression of the blanking process, the result is a flat part that may retain a specific level of flatness for additional manufacturing operations.
*Broaching: The process of removing material through the use of multiple cutting teeth, with each tooth cutting behind the other. A broaching die is often used to remove material from parts that are too thick for shaving.
*Bulging: A bulging die expands the closed end of tube through the use of two types of bulging dies. Similar to the way a chef&#x27;s hat bulges out at the top from the cylindrical band around the chef&#x27;s head.
#Bulging fluid dies: Uses water or oil as a vehicle to expand the part.
#Bulging rubber dies: Uses a rubber pad or block under pressure to move the wall of a workpiece.
*Coining: is similar to forming with the main difference being that a coining die may form completely different features on either face of the blank, these features being transferred from the face of the punch or die respectively. The coining die and punch flow the metal by squeezing the blank within a confined area, instead of bending the blank. For example, an Olympic medal that was formed from a coining die may have a flat surface on the back and a raised feature on the front. If the medal was formed (or embossed), the surface on the back would be the reverse image of the front.
*Compound operations: Compound dies perform multiple operations on the part. The compound operation is the act of implementing more than one operation during the press cycle.
*Compound die: A type of die that has the die block (matrix) mounted on a punch plate with perforators in the upper die with the inner punch mounted in the lower die set. An inverted type of blanking dies that punches upwards, leaving the part sitting on the lower punch (after being shed from the upper matrix on the press return stroke) instead of blanking the part through. A compound die allows the cutting of internal and external part features on a single press stroke. 
*Curling: The curling operation is used to roll the material into a curved shape. A door hinge is an example of a part created by a curling die.
*Cut off: Cut off dies are used to cut off excess material from a finished end of a part or to cut off a predetermined length of material strip for additional operations.
*Drawing: The drawing operation is very similar to the forming operation except that the drawing operation undergoes severe plastic deformation and the material of the part extends around the sides. A metal cup with a detailed feature at the bottom is an example of the difference between formed and drawn. The bottom of the cup was formed while the sides were drawn.
*Extruding: Extruding is the act of severely deforming blanks of metal called slugs into finished parts such as an aluminum I-beam. Extrusion dies use extremely high pressure from the punch to squeeze the metal out into the desired form. The difference between cold forming and extrusion is extruded parts do not take shape of the punch.
*Forming: Forming dies to bend the blank along a curved surface. An example of a part that has been formed would be the positive end(+) of a AA battery.
*Cold forming (cold heading): Cold forming is similar to extruding in that it squeezes the blank material but cold forming uses the punch and the die to create the desired form, extruding does not.

*Roll forming: a continuous bending operation in which sheet or strip metal is gradually formed in tandem sets of rollers until the desired cross-sectional configuration is obtained. Roll forming is ideal for producing parts with long lengths or in large quantities.
*Horning: A horning die provides an arbor or horn in which the parts are placed for secondary operations.
*Hydroforming: Forming of tubular part from simpler tubes with high water pressure.
*Pancake die: A Pancake die is a simple type of manufacturing die that performs blanking and/or piercing. While many dies perform complex procedures simultaneously, a pancake die may only perform one simple procedure with the finished product being removed by hand.
*Piercing: The piercing operation is used to pierce holes in stampings.
*Transfer die: Transfer dies provide different stations for operations to be performed. A common practice is to move the material through the die so it is progressively modified at each station until the final operation ejects a finished part.
*Progressive die: The sheet metal is fed through as a coil strip, and a different operation (such as punching, blanking, and notching) is performed at the same station of the machine with each stroke of a series of punches.
*Punching: 
*Shaving: The shaving operation removes a small amount of material from the edges of the part to improve the edges finish or part accuracy. (Compare to Trimming).
*Side cam die: Side cams transform vertical motion from the press ram into horizontal or angular motion.
*Sub press operation: Sub-press dies blank and/or form small watch, clock, and instrument parts.
*Swaging: Swaging (necking) is the process of &quot;necking down&quot; a feature on a part. Swaging is the opposite of bulging as it reduces the size of the part. The end of a shell casing that captures the bullet is an example of swaging.
*Trimming: Trimming dies cut away excess or unwanted irregular features from a part, they are usually the last operation performed.
*Pillar set: Pillar set are used for alignment of dies in press movement.

== Steel-rule die ==

&quot;Steel-rule&quot; die, also known as &quot;cookie cutter&quot; dies, are used for cutting sheet metal and softer materials, such as plastics, wood, cork, felt, fabrics, and paperboard. The cutting surface of the die is the edge of hardened steel strips, known as &quot;steel rule&quot;. These steel rules are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. Rubber strips are wedged in with the steel rule to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the up-stroke it pushes the workpiece out of the die. The main advantage of steel-rule dies is the low cost to make them, as compared to solid dies; however, they are not as robust as solid dies, so they are usually only used for short production runs.

== Rotary die ==

In the broadest sense, a &quot;rotary die&quot; is a cylindrical shaped die that may be used in any manufacturing field. However, it most commonly refers to cylindrical shaped dies used to process soft materials, such as paper or cardboard. Two rules are used, cutting and creasing rules. This is for corrugated boards whose thickness is more than 2 mm. Rotary dies are faster than flat dies.

The term also refers to dies used in the roll forming process.

==Wire pulling==

Wire-making dies have a hole through the middle of them. A wire or rod of steel, copper, other metals, or alloy enters into one side and is lubricated and reduced in size. The leading tip of the wire is usually pointed in the process. The tip of the wire is then guided into the die and rolled onto a block on the opposite side. The block provides the power to pull the wire through the die.

The die is divided into several different sections. First is an entrance angle that guides the wire into the die. Next is the approach angle, which brings the wire to the nib, which facilitates the reduction. Next is the bearing and the back relief. Lubrication is added at the entrance angle. The lube can be in powdered soap form. If the lubricant is soap, the friction of the drawing of wire heats the soap to liquid form and coats the wire. The wire should never actually come in contact with the die. A thin coat of lubricant should prevent the metal to metal contact.

For pulling a substantial rod down to a fine wire a series of several dies is used to obtain progressive reduction of diameter in stages.

Standard wire gauges used to refer to the number of dies through which the wire had been pulled. Thus, a higher-numbered wire gauge meant a thinner wire. Typical telephone wires were 22-gauge, while main power cables might be 3- or 4-gauge.

<doc id="648008" wikidata="Q752732" url="?curid=648008" title="Asymptotic freedom">
<text>In quantum field theory, asymptotic freedom is a property of some gauge theories that causes interactions between particles to become asymptotically weaker as the energy scale increases and the corresponding length scale decreases. (Alternatively, and perhaps contrarily, in applying an S-matrix, asymptotically free refers to free particles states in the distant past or the distant future.)

Asymptotic freedom is a feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the quantum field theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of nuclear matter. Quarks interact weakly at high energies, allowing perturbative calculations. At low energies, the interaction becomes strong, leading to the confinement of quarks and gluons within composite hadrons.

The asymptotic freedom of QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek, 
and independently by David Politzer in the same year. 
For this work all three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics.

== Discovery ==

Asymptotic freedom in QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek, and independently by David Politzer in the same year. The same phenomenon had previously been observed (in quantum electrodynamics with a charged vector field, by V.S. Vanyashin and M.V. Terent&#x27;ev in 1965; and Yang–Mills theory by Iosif Khriplovich in 1969 and Gerard &#x27;t Hooft in 1972), but its physical significance was not realized until the work of Gross, Wilczek and Politzer, which was recognized by the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator showed that inside protons, quarks behaved as if they were free. This was a great surprise, as many believed quarks to be tightly bound by the strong interaction, and so they should rapidly dissipate their motion by strong interaction radiation when they got violently accelerated, much like how electrons emit electromagnetic radiation when accelerated.

The discovery was instrumental in &quot;rehabilitating&quot; quantum field theory. Prior to 1973, many theorists suspected that field theory was fundamentally inconsistent because the interactions become infinitely strong at short distances. This phenomenon is usually called a Landau pole, and it defines the smallest length scale that a theory can describe. This problem was discovered in field theories of interacting scalars and spinors, including quantum electrodynamics (QED), and Lehmann positivity led many to suspect that it is unavoidable. 
Asymptotically free theories become weak at short distances, there is no Landau pole, and these quantum field theories are believed to be completely consistent down to any length scale.

Electroweak theory within the Standard Model is not asymptotically free. So a Landau pole exists in the Standard Model. With the Landau pole a problem arises when Higgs boson is being considered. Quantum triviality can be used to bound or predict parameters such as the Higgs boson mass. This leads to a predictable Higgs mass in asymptotic safety scenarios. In other scenarios, interactions are weak so that any inconsistency arises at distances shorter than the Planck length.

== Screening and antiscreening ==

The variation in a physical coupling constant under changes of scale can be understood qualitatively as coming from the action of the field on virtual particles carrying the relevant charge. The Landau pole behavior of QED (related to quantum triviality) is a consequence of &quot;screening&quot; by virtual charged particle–antiparticle pairs, such as electron–positron pairs, in the vacuum. In the vicinity of a charge, the vacuum becomes &quot;polarized&quot;: virtual particles of opposing charge are attracted to the charge, and virtual particles of like charge are repelled. The net effect is to partially cancel out the field at any finite distance. Getting closer and closer to the central charge, one sees less and less of the effect of the vacuum, and the effective charge increases.

In QCD the same thing happens with virtual quark-antiquark pairs; they tend to screen the color charge. However, QCD has an additional wrinkle: its force-carrying particles, the gluons, themselves carry color charge, and in a different manner. Each gluon carries both a color charge and an anti-color magnetic moment. The net effect of polarization of virtual gluons in the vacuum is not to screen the field but to &quot;augment&quot; it and change its color. This is sometimes called &quot;antiscreening&quot; (color paramagnetism). Getting closer to a quark diminishes the antiscreening effect of the surrounding virtual gluons, so the contribution of this effect would be to weaken the effective charge with decreasing distance.

Since the virtual quarks and the virtual gluons contribute opposite effects, which effect wins out depends on the number of different kinds, or flavors, of quark. For standard QCD with three colors, as long as there are no more than 16 flavors of quark (not counting the antiquarks separately), antiscreening prevails and the theory is asymptotically free. In fact, there are only 6 known quark flavors.

== Calculating asymptotic freedom ==

Asymptotic freedom can be derived by calculating the beta function describing the variation of the theory&#x27;s coupling constant under the renormalization group. For sufficiently short distances or large exchanges of momentum (which probe short-distance behavior, roughly because of the inverse relationship between a quantum&#x27;s momentum and De Broglie wavelength), an asymptotically free theory is amenable to perturbation theory calculations using Feynman diagrams. Such situations are therefore more theoretically tractable than the long-distance, strong-coupling behavior also often present in such theories, which is thought to produce confinement.

Calculating the beta-function is a matter of evaluating Feynman diagrams contributing to the interaction of a quark emitting or absorbing a gluon. Essentially, the beta-function describes how the coupling constants vary as one scales the system formula_1. The calculation can be done using rescaling in position space or momentum space (momentum shell integration). In non-abelian gauge theories such as QCD, the existence of asymptotic freedom depends on the gauge group and number of flavors of interacting particles. To lowest nontrivial order, the beta-function in an SU(N) gauge theory with formula_2 kinds of quark-like particle is

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the theory&#x27;s equivalent of the fine-structure constant, formula_5 in the units favored by particle physicists. If this function is negative, the theory is asymptotically free. For SU(3), one has formula_6
and the requirement that formula_7 gives 
:formula_8
Thus for SU(3), the color charge gauge group of QCD, the theory is asymptotically free if there are 16 or fewer flavors of quarks.

Besides QCD, asymptotic freedom can also be seen in other systems like the nonlinear formula_9-model in 2 dimensions, which has a structure similar to the SU(N) invariant Yang–Mills theory in 4 dimensions.

Finally, one can find theories that are asymptotically free and reduce to the full Standard Model of electromagnetic, weak and strong forces at low enough energies.

<text>Harold Floyd &quot;Tina&quot; Brooks (June 7, 1932 – August 13, 1974) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and composer best remembered for his work in the hard bop style.

==Early years==
Harold Floyd Brooks was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and was the brother of David &quot;Bubba&quot; Brooks. The nickname &quot;Tina&quot;, pronounced &quot;Teena&quot;, was a variation of &quot;Teeny&quot;, a childhood moniker. His favourite tune was &quot;My Devotion&quot;. He studied harmony and theory with Herbert Bourne.

Initially, he studied the C-melody saxophone, which he began playing shortly after he moved to New York with his family in 1944. Brooks&#x27; first professional work came in 1951 with rhythm and blues pianist Sonny Thompson, and in 1955 Brooks played with vibraphonist Lionel Hampton. Brooks also received less-formal guidance from trumpeter and composer &quot;Little&quot; Benny Harris, who led the saxophonist to his first recording as a leader. Harris recommended Brooks to Blue Note producer Alfred Lion in 1958.

==Recordings==
Brooks is best known for his recordings for the Blue Note label between 1958 and 1961, recording as a sideman with Kenny Burrell, Freddie Hubbard, Jackie McLean, Freddie Redd, and Jimmy Smith. Around the same period, Brooks was McLean&#x27;s understudy in &quot;The Connection&quot;, a play by Jack Gelber with music by Redd, and performed on an album of music from the play on Felsted Records, a session which also featured Howard McGhee.

Brooks recorded five sessions of his own for Blue Note (including one jointly with McLean). The first session was recorded on March 16, 1958 at the Van Gelder Studio in Hackensack, New Jersey, and featured trumpeter Lee Morgan alongside seasoned professionals such as Sonny Clark, Doug Watkins and Art Blakey. However, for unknown reasons, &quot;Minor Move&quot; was not released for more than two decades, several years after Brooks had died. This started an unfortunate trend, as three of his four other sessions (&quot;Street Singer&quot;, &quot;Back to the Tracks&quot; and &quot;The Waiting Game&quot;) did not appear during his lifetime. The exception was &quot;True Blue&quot;, a session recorded on June 25, 1960 with Freddie Hubbard, Duke Jordan, Sam Jones and Art Taylor. The release of &quot;True Blue&quot; coincided with the release of Hubbard&#x27;s Blue Note debut album, &quot;Open Sesame&quot; (also featuring Brooks, who wrote the opening title track as well as &quot;Gypsy Blue&quot;), and was not actively promoted.

Brooks did not record after 1961. Plagued by heroin dependency, and gradually deteriorating health, he died of liver failure at age 42.

==Legacy and Musical Revival==
Until 1980, &quot;True Blue&quot; remained the only Brooks album commercially released. In 1980, Blue Note Japan released the &quot;Minor Move&quot; and &quot;Street Singer&quot; albums, the latter jointly credited to Jackie McLean. In 1985, Mosaic Records released &quot;The Complete Blue Note Recordings Of The Tina Brooks Quintets&quot; on a 4-LP set, which made &quot;Back to the Tracks&quot; and &quot;The Waiting Game&quot; available for the first time. The Mosaic set, a limited edition produced by Michael Cuscuna, is out of print. In the CD era, all of Brooks&#x27; Blue Note sessions as a leader or co-leader have been released on CD, including on releases by Blue Note Japan and Blue Note&#x27;s Connoisseur series.

In the liner notes for the CD release of &quot;Back to the Tracks&quot;, Cuscuna wrote: &quot;Far lesser talents have been far more celebrated&quot; and that Brooks &quot;was a unique, sensitive improviser who could weave beautiful and complex tapestries through his horn. His lyricism, unity of ideas and inner logic were astounding.&quot;

David Rosenthal in his book &quot;Hard Bop: Jazz and Black Music 1955-1965&quot; wrote about Brooks. Of his composition &quot;Street Singer&quot;, Rosenthal wrote that it is &quot;an authentic hard-bop classic&quot; where &quot;pathos, irony and rage come together in a performance at once anguished and sinister.&quot;

The official Blue Note website says of Brooks: &quot;With a strong, smooth tone and an amazing flow of fresh ideas every time he soloed, tenor saxophonist Tina Brooks should have been a major jazz artist, but his legacy is confined to a series of dates that he did for Blue Note as a sideman and leader&quot; and that he &quot;was one of the most brilliant, if underrated, tenor saxophonists in modern jazz.&quot;

<text>The Great Eastern Railway (GER) was a pre-grouping British railway company, whose main line linked London Liverpool Street to Norwich and which had other lines through East Anglia. The company was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923.

Formed in 1862 after the amalgamation of the Eastern Counties Railway and several other smaller railway companies the GER served Cambridge, Chelmsford, Colchester, Great Yarmouth, Ipswich, King&#x27;s Lynn, Lowestoft, Norwich, Southend-on-Sea (opened by the GER in 1889), and East Anglian seaside resorts such as Hunstanton (whose prosperity was largely a result of the GER&#x27;s line being built) and Cromer. It also served a suburban area, including Enfield, Chingford, Loughton and Ilford. This suburban network was, in the early 20th century, the busiest steam-hauled commuter system in the world.

The majority of the Great Eastern&#x27;s locomotives and rolling stock were built at Stratford Works, part of which was on the site of today&#x27;s Stratford International station and the rest was adjacent to Stratford Regional station. The GER owned of line and had a near-monopoly in East Anglia until the opening of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway in 1893 although there were a number of minor lines, such as the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway that stayed resolutely independent until after the grouping in 1923.

== History ==
===Amalgamation===
Between 1851 and 1854 the Eastern Counties Railway under the chairmanship of David Waddington had negotiated arrangements to work most of the other railways in East Anglia resulting in a network of lines totalling . Whilst Parliament favoured competition it was also aware that the ECR was constantly at war with its neighbours and whilst these working arrangements were approved there was a condition that a bill for full amalgamation was presented by 1861.

Waddington departed under a cloud in 1856 and was replaced by Horatio Love. By 1860 many shareholders were unhappy listing several grievances they saw as getting in the way of their dividend payments. These included continual conflict over working of other lines, suspicion and distrust of the joint committee, inadequate services to and from London, on-going litigation and law costs and a lack of progress on amalgamation.
By February 1862 the bill had its second reading and was then followed by a lengthy committee process where various parties petitioned against the bill. On 7 August 1862 the bill passed as the (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. ccxxiii) and the Great Eastern Railway was formed by the amalgamation of the Eastern Counties Railway and a number of smaller railways (the Newmarket and Chesterford Railway, the Eastern Union Railway, and the Norfolk Railway).

===Early years (1862-1869)===
Unsurprisingly the first GER board had a strong Eastern Counties flavour with Horatio Love in the chair and James Goodson the deputy chair. The board consisted of six former ECR directors with two Eastern Union Railway, two Norfolk Railway and one each from the Northern and Eastern Railway (still an independent body at this point) and East Anglian Railway.
Operational costs were high on the new railway and new sources of revenue needed quickly. Work at improving suburban services was put in hand and trains from London to Norwich speeded up to give businessmen and merchants more time to conduct their business. A new suburban line to Enfield Town via Seven Sisters was proposed as well as a new London terminus to replace an inadequate Bishopsgate. By August 1863 receipts were increasing and many of the pre-amalgamation disputes were being settled.

The GER and Great Northern Railway each submitted bills for a line from March to Spalding and although the GNR was successful the GER was awarded running rights over the new line which would later become part of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway. Steamboat services were also seen as a new source of revenue with services running from Harwich to Rotterdam, Flushing and Antwerp.

A change of leadership also occurred with Horatio Love being replaced by James Goodson as chairman with Captain Henry Jervis-White-Jervis as his deputy. Love was considered too cautious and some on the board still resented his role prior to amalgamation at the ECR. Various directors were allocated specific responsibilities (generally running these through committees) leaving Goodson free to develop new schemes and represent the GER on lines where they had a financial interest.

Following an accident at North Wootton in early August 1863, where the deaths of five passengers was partially attributed to the poor state of the rolling stock, a large rolling stock order was placed.

By December 1863 the financial picture was looking better and in early 1864 the GER started looking a new railway to move coal from South Yorkshire to London via Spalding and the GN link from Spalding to March. The Great Eastern was clearly in an expansionist phase with further locomotives (forming the basis of standardisation over its disparate inherited fleet), carriages and wagons under construction. More ships were being ordered for Antwerp and Rotterdam traffic and proposals for 28 miles of new metropolitan lines and a new city terminus.

In March 1864, a joint committee of the House of Commons and House of Lords approved the East London Line which would link the North London, Great Eastern and London and Blackwall railways. The parliamentary bill for the new freight line failed although other bills including the construction of a new London terminus were approved. Later that year the GER was in talks about expansion northwards with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) which lead to the deposition of a bill in early 1865.

The board meeting of February 1865 saw passenger receipts outstripping goods receipts. Fish traffic from Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth was growing and money was being spent on stations, replacing wooden bridges and upgrading the track. However, a number of shareholders voiced concern. The following month the House of Commons rejected the joint GER/L&amp;YR bill forcing the GER to restart negotiations with the Great Northern Railway. The chairman of the parliamentary committee suggested to the board that the next bill should include a direct Spalding to Lincoln link.

Board unity was about to be shattered when a short paragraph in &quot;The Times&quot; reported serious differences of opinions existed between the directors. In August 1865 deputy chairman Jervis-White-Jervis issued an appeal raising concerns about the management of the railway. This prompted an internal investigation and in a board meeting at the end of the month, an absent Jervis-White-Jervis was replaced by William Shaw as deputy chairman. The internal investigation concluded that many of Jervis-White-Jervis&#x27;s concerns were relevant including borrowing more money than authorised and the poor deal the GER got on leasing the London and Blackwell Railway. In a meeting in January the following year many of the directors were duly replaced (by members of the investigating committee) and at the following board meeting in February, Charles Turner was elected as the new chairman.

The new board, facing a financial crisis, had identified a number of issues including the provision of a new terminus station at Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate (the existing terminus) was to be converted to a goods terminal and a new coal depot to be built in Whitechapel. The financial environment was still proving difficult with losses on the London and Blackwell line and a cattle plague seriously affecting that traffic. By March the board was meeting most days in an effort to keep the railway running.

The financial crisis of 1866 saw loan interest rates rise to 10% on 12 May. On 8 June the board approached Parliament for the right to borrow more money and raise additional money through new shares to fund the expansion programme outlined above. This was confirmed on 4 July. By this time there was little money available for dividends and the company looked very carefully at their expansion programme and unprofitable branch lines. By December 1866 little interest was being shown in the new shares, so the board went unsuccessfully to the Bank of England and Union Bank for further loans. The GER did, however, manage to agree running rights via the Great Northern Railway as far as Wakefield and with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway to interchange traffic at Lincoln and Retford.

The crisis continued into 1867 and by March it was apparent that the preference share payments due in April could not be paid. The board also received a letter from the drivers seeking improved working conditions. Additionally &quot;The Times&quot; suggested the GER may be about to appoint a receiver. Early April saw daily negotiations with the Union Bank although agreement was reached with the drivers by the middle of that month.

May saw the company trying to raise further funds via a parliamentary bill. However, by 25 June the House of Lords had rejected the bill and the board took steps to protect the company&#x27;s property from its creditors. Matters were hardly helped when deputy chairman Samuel Laing resigned to become the chairman of the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway on 1 July. On 2 July a suit was bought before vice-chancellor Sir Richard Malins and the GER was placed into chancery.

Regrouping after this, the board pursued Edward Watkin, an MP with many other railway interests, as chairman. He did advise that the board that it needed to reconstitute itself in order to rebuild confidence in order to acquire new capital. Some existing members of the board were not pleased with this and it was not until 3 January 1868 that a reduced board of eleven members met with six new members including Watkin and Viscount Cranbourne MP who was elected as the new chairman.

The new directors were all allocated specific roles and a number of changes were made to reduce costs and improve profitability. Cranbourne also approached the London &amp; North Western Railway to report on the state of the permanent way and rolling stock. By August 1868 the tide was turning with increased receipts and some debts being paid off. The GER had done a deal with the Midland Railway to route their coal traffic via their lines and a new coal depot at Whitechapel opened in December further improving profitability.

By August 1869 the financial position had improved enough to restore a dividend and this was whilst the Walthamstow line (now the Chingford branch line) was under construction. In the same month, Deputy Chairman Charles Turner resigned due to suspected fraud which was to lead to his bankruptcy later in the year. Although proceedings were initiated no prosecution resulted.

===1870-1879 A new London terminus===

The original London terminus was opened at Shoreditch in east London by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) on 1 July 1840 when the railway was extended westwards from an earlier temporary terminus in Devonshire Street, near Mile End. The station was renamed Bishopsgate on 27 July 1847.

The Great Eastern attempted to obtain a West End terminus, alongside the one in east London, via the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway, formed by an act of Parliament, the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway Act 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. cc) of 28 July 1862. Plans to extend the western end of this line via a proposed &#x27;London Main Trunk Railway&#x27;, underneath Hampstead Road, the Metropolitan Railway (modern Circle line) and Tottenham Court Road, to Charing Cross, were rejected by Parliament in 1864.

A new London terminus at Liverpool Street was opened to traffic on 2 February 1874, and was completely operational from 1 November 1875. From this date the original terminus at Bishopsgate closed to passengers, although it reopened as a goods station in 1881.

===1900-1914===
In 1902 the Northern and Eastern Railway was finally absorbed by the GER, although it had been worked by the Eastern Counties Railway under a 999-year lease taken on 1 January 1844 whereby the Eastern Counties Railway would work the Northern and Eastern Railway in return for an annual rent and division of the profits.

Despite several half-hearted attempts by the GER during the latter part of the nineteenth century, it was the Midland Railway (MR) that finally bought the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) in 1912 with the MR offering a better deal for the LT&amp;SR shareholders than the GER ever had. The agreement was ratified by the LT&amp;SR shareholders on 26 June 1911. During the following parliamentary session, the official parliamentary bill allowing the takeover by the MR was passed on 7 August 1912 although it was legally backdated to 1 January 1912. At the time of the sale the LT&amp;SR was one of the most prosperous railways in the UK but too small to fund the changes it needed to make.

In 1914 the GER became the first UK railway company to employ a general manager from overseas, Henry Worth Thornton. He had previously worked as the General Superintendent of the Long Island Railroad in the USA.

===During the First World War 1914-1918===
The Railway Executive Committee was set up in 1912 after an incident between France and Germany in the Moroccan Port of Agadir and would take directions from the military and liaise with the railway companies. As it adjoined the North Sea the GER undertook a significant role in the war.
Had there been an invasion then the railways had evacuation plans for the civilian populations. The GER did require some upgrading to deal with the increased levels of traffic – lines were doubled, additional passing loops provided, platforms extended and watering facilities improved (for both the iron and more conventional horses). A number of link lines were provided including the link between the Tottenham and Hampstead at Gospel Oak to the Midland Railway and between the T&amp;H and Great Northern Railway at Crouch Hill, Both links remain part of the national network .

When the war started several jobs fell to the railway – reserve troops and naval personnel had to be returned to their units and this saw an upsurge in usage of normal services. Various units were moved to the coast for defensive purposes and at the same time the government had started buying horses throughout the area leading to additional trains. There were also then the units that were being moved to the front line. The Royal Navy was using coal as its primary source of propulsion and additional coal trains would have been operated through the area as well.

In August 1914 the Germans disguised a passenger steamer (the ) in GER colours and deployed it as a minelayer. This ruse was spotted on 5 August 1914 and the ship sunk by the British light cruiser and destroyers and .

The GER employed significant numbers of women during this period as many men had joined the army.

By 1916 unnecessary travel was being discouraged to conserve coal supplies.

The company set up a section dedicated to the movement of military traffic and between 1914 and 1918 nearly 10.5 million men were moved on GER services as well as significant numbers of horses and supplies. Specific military traffic was generated at Brimsdown, Ponders End and Stowmarket. Because of attacks on east coast shipping, traffic previously moved by sea was also carried on the GER (and more specifically the Great Eastern and Great Northern Joint Railway).

The GER also suffered from a number of Zeppelin attacks with, amongst others, the dormitory at Stratford engine shed and the royal shelter at King&#x27;s Lynn both being hit.

===After the First World War (1918-1923)===
In 1922, a large marble memorial was installed at Liverpool Street station commemorating GER staff who had answered the call of duty to fight but died in action in the First World War. The memorial was unveiled by Sir Henry Wilson, who was assassinated by two Irish Republican Army gunmen on his way home from the unveiling ceremony. A smaller memorial to Wilson was later placed adjacent to the GER memorial, alongside one to Charles Fryatt, a British mariner who was executed by the Germans for attempting to ram a U-boat in 1915.

The Great Eastern name has survived, being used both for the Great Eastern Main Line route between London and Norwich, and also for the First Great Eastern train operating company which served much of the old GER route between 1997 and 2004.

==Constituent companies==
The Great Eastern Railway was made up of a number of constituent companies when it was formed in 1862. The most notable was the Eastern Counties Railway, which had taken over most of the main companies by this time. After 1862 there were still a number of companies operating independently in East Anglia, but most of these were eventually taken over by Great Eastern, although some such as the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway survived until 1923.
The history and exact status of many of these railways is quite complex. In many cases the operation of the railway that built the line was taken over (usually by the Eastern Counties Railway before 1862 and the Great Eastern Railway after that date) although the original railway company often existed in legal form after that date.

The Great Eastern Railway Act 1862 stated that the purpose of the legislation was &quot;to amalgamate the Eastern Counties, the East Anglian, the Newmarket, the Eastern Union and the Norfolk railway companies, and for other purposes&quot;. This suggests that despite the fact that some of these railway companies had been taken over by the Eastern Counties Railway prior to the 1862 act, they still legally existed.
* BTR (Bury St Edmunds and Thetford Railway) – became part of the GER in 1878.
* EAR (East Anglian Railway) – taken over by ECR in 1852 but existed until the 1862 act
* ECR (Eastern Counties Railway) – was the principal constituent of the GER in the 1862 act
* EHSR - Ely, Haddenham and Sutton Railway) – although independent, the GER had a third share of its capital. The GER also provided staff, locomotives and rolling stock in return for 50% of the gross takings. Changed name to ESIR in 1878
* ESIR (Ely and St Ives Railway) – taken over by GER in 1898
* E&amp;NR (Ely and Newmarket Railway) – built Ely to Newmarket line. Formed in 1875 and taken over by GER in 1898.
* ENR (East Norfolk Railway) – built many lines in East Norfolk - later vested into the GER
* ESR (East Suffolk Railway) – taken over by ECR in 1859
* EUR (Eastern Union Railway) – taken over by ECR in 1854 but existed until the 1862 act.
* FR (Felixstowe Railway) – line operated by GE from 1878 and taken over fully in 1885
* IBR (Ipswich and Bury Railway) – amalgamated with EUR in 1847
* LBR (London and Blackwall Railway) – leased by the GER in 1866, but remained independent until the 1923 Grouping.
* LDR (Lynn and Dereham Railway) – amalgamated with LER to form EAR in 1847
* LER (Lynn and Ely Railway) – amalgamated with LDR to form EAR in 1847
* LHR (Lynn and Hunstanton Railway)
* LID (London and India Dock Railway Company) – lines operated by GER from opening
* LRH (Lowestoft Railway and Harbour Company) – leased line to NR in 1847

===Joint railways===
* The East London Railway was created by the East London Railway Company, a consortium of six railway companies: the GER, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), the South Eastern Railway (SER), the Metropolitan Railway, and the District Railway. The latter two operated what are now the Metropolitan, Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines of the London Underground. The GER had two seats on the management committee which met twice per year and the GER members were supported by the company secretary and a solicitor.
* GNGEJR Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway - a joint railway committee formed in 1879. It consisted of five directors from each company, met every quarter and the GER members were supported by the Secretary, a solicitor, an engineer and the General Manager. 
* NSJR - Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway Committee - a joint committee formed with the Midland and Great Northern Railway
* T&amp;HR - Tottenham and Hampstead Joint Railway - run in conjunction with the Midland Railway.

==Infrastructure==

===Stations===


===Engine sheds===
The Great Eastern had one of the largest engine sheds in the country at Stratford which in January 1923 had an allocation of 555 locomotives. At the other end of the scale, small engine sheds at the end of country branch lines had perhaps one or two locomotives in their charge. At this time the locomotives were generally allocated to the major shed in the area and the smaller sheds had no actual allocation.

Before 1914 the engine sheds were organised into districts, with sheds at: Stratford; Ipswich; Norwich; Cambridge; Peterborough; King&#x27;s Lynn; and Doncaster. In 1914 this was reduced to five with King&#x27;s Lynn and Doncaster being abolished. By 1915 they were organised onto four districts (primary sheds in parentheses): Southern (Stratford); Eastern (Ipswich); Northern (Norwich); and Western (Cambridge/Peterborough).

The Great Eastern did not see the maintenance of engine sheds as one of its top priorities. Many original structures it inherited from constituent railways struggled on in various states of disrepair, not only through Great Eastern days, but through its successor company London &amp; North Eastern Railway from 1923 until 1947 and indeed to the end of steam on the Great Eastern in 1959.

Coaling at engine sheds was generally done by hand with the coaling stages constructed of wood. At a busy engine shed such as Stratford, each individual coaler employed on the coaling stage was expected to empty the contents of a coal truck during his shift.

Turntables were generally small – in 1900 the longest was – enough to turn the later B12 Class 4-6-0 locomotive. By 1932, with the advent of bigger locomotives and the working of other companies&#x27; locomotives onto GE territory, turntables had grown, with the major sheds generally having turntables.

In 1922 the GER locomotive allocation across its sheds was: Cambridge - 178; Colchester - 47; Doncaster - 5; Ipswich - 131; King&#x27;s Lynn - 37; Lincoln (Pyewipe Junction) - 12; Lowestoft - 22; March - 97; Norwich - 119; Parkeston - 20; Peterborough East - 86; Stratford - 555; Wisbech - 7; and Yarmouth - 20. Each main shed had a number of sub-sheds and locomotives would work from these sheds for significant periods. For instance it is estimated that some 150 engines were outbased from Stratford at any one time.

===Works===

The main workshops were located at Stratford Works and was responsible for the building of locomotives and carriages. Wagons were initially built here as well but as the railway grew a new wagon works was built at Temple Mills in 1896.

In 1894 a carriage painting facility was opened at Felixstowe Beach station which dealt with the painting of around 200 carriages each year.

Many engine sheds carried out heavier repairs. Ipswich engine shed for instance had a tube shop and a smithy containing eight forges and a steamhammer.

Another wagon works was located at Ipswich (adjacent to the engine shed south of the tunnel).

Stratford Works and Ipswich lasted until the 1990s but Temple Mills closed in 1983.

===Signal boxes===
The GER always allowed contractors a certain amount of freedom within their specified design, and three early types evolved built by Saxby &amp; Farmer, Stevens or McKenzie &amp; Holland. By 1877 the GER were consolidating their own design, which featured a gabled roof, with large overhang, and weatherboarding. Windows were always two panes high in this design. A more ornate style of construction replaced this type in 1882, but this did not last long - the GER was never a rich railway. By 1883 brick boxes were being built to a plainer design, although 1884 saw some ornateness returning. For instance, March West box contained mock stonework in the gables, fancy window design and decorated bargeboards.

By 1886 timber boxes were being constructed again as well as brick examples but this - with some variation - was the last design for Great Eastern signal boxes.

By 1997 there were still 90 of these in service, but with recent (2012) changes, and more changes expected. 
, then it is unlikely that many will remain in service for much longer.
==Operations and timetables==

===Main line===
Over the years the principal main line services between Norwich and Liverpool Street were routed via Ipswich or Cambridge, generally depending on the quickest journey time available. Before the GER was formed its predecessor the Eastern Counties Railway had a reputation for speed second only to the Great Western and Great Northern Railways. From 1850 to 1855 Cambridge could be reached in 75 minutes ( from Stratford), a further 20 minutes to Ely () and a further 55 minutes to Wymondham () giving an average speed of . There is some doubt as to the reliability of these times; as the writer Thackeray observed in The Lamentable Ballad of the Foundling of Shoreditch, &quot;For even the Heastern Counties&#x27; trains must come in at last.&quot;

In the early days of the GER the 5 p.m. departure from Shoreditch (the terminus before Liverpool Street) took 52 minutes to reach Bishop&#x27;s Stortford (average speed ) and 92 to get to Cambridge.

Because the route via Colchester had been built by a number of different companies, mostly in dubious states of financial stability, it was some years before the Colchester route rose to prominence. Then, as line speeds on this or the Cambridge line improved, the focus of the Norwich services would shift from one to another. On taking over the entire route in 1862, the GER improved speeds on the Colchester line so that Colchester was reached in 70 minutes (non-stop) and Yarmouth (via the East Suffolk route) could be reached in 3 hours 25 minutes. Norwich was 3 hours and 15 minutes via Ipswich and 4 hours via Cambridge.

In 1869 the situation had been reversed and it was quicker to get to Norwich via Cambridge (3 hours 30 minutes) compared to 4 hours 15 minutes via Ipswich. In 1870/1 the balance shifted back to the Ipswich route, with a time of 3 hours 35 minutes compared to 3 hours 53 minutes via Cambridge. By 1878 the Cambridge route was ascendant, with times of 3 hours 12 minutes for the fastest trains compared to a time of 4 hours 10 minutes via Ipswich. In the 1880s both routes had similar times, but by 1887 the Ipswich route offered a time of 2 hours 40 minutes which improved to 2 hours 31 minutes in 1897 and by a further five minutes in 1906.

===Main line boat trains===
Boat trains commenced running to Harwich Parkeston Quay in 1882 and were timed at 1 hour 45 minutes from Liverpool Street. By 1895 this was down to 1 hour 30 minutes. In 1897 the 8:30 pm train was run as two separate trains - 8:30 pm for the Hook of Holland and 8:35 pm for Antwerp. With the introduction of the corridor restaurant cars in 1904, the time was eased to 87 minutes, but the introduction of the Class 1500 4-6-0 express engines in 1912 saw a running time of 82 minutes.

===Suburban services (the Jazz)===

The Great Eastern was renowned for operating an intensive suburban service which became known as &quot;the &quot;Jazz&quot;.

Serving the East End of London, the London Docklands and the capital&#x27;s eastern suburbs, the Great Eastern&#x27;s suburban services had a much greater proportion of working class industrial workers, labourers and lower-ranking office workers than the suburban networks of the likes of the London and South Western Railway or the Metropolitan. The GER had to transport greater numbers of passengers commuting in and out of the urban centre and at lower fares. The GER encouraged passenger numbers with low-price &#x27;workman fares&#x27; services which ran in the early morning and late evening. These used older rolling stock with high-density seating (often using wooden benches for ease of cleaning after being used by passengers from docks, factories and markets in dirty work clothes). There were also &#x27;half fare trains&#x27; using more modern and comfortable suburban coaching stock aimed at lower-income white-collar workers such as clerks and junior office workers. There was a symbiotic relationship between the railway and property development - the existence of the railway made it possible for even industrial workers to move into new housing developments in the suburbs which then provided extra custom for the GER. The GER itself invested in property development near its routes and in some cases even built its own housing on land purchased as part of railway construction. Although most closely associated with these crowded, low-cost commuter train serving the suburbs of eastern London, the GER also provided luxurious first class compartments in many of its commuter trains for businessmen and wealthier customers travelling to and from The City with its numerous banks and other financial offices.

By 1900 over 90 per cent of passengers using Liverpool Street station were making journeys of 12 miles (19 km) or less and around 75,000 people arrived at the station before 10.30am each morning. A total of 400 suburban and 36 main line trains were timetabled to use the terminus each day. Passenger numbers continued to rise in the early 20th century and a survey in 1913 showed that some of the GER&#x27;s suburban trains were carrying up to 1400 people each and the station itself was beginning to suffer from overcrowding at peak times that was not only preventing the easy movement of people in and out and delaying the departure of trains but presenting a danger to the public.

After World War I (during which a decline in passenger numbers provided something of a reprieve) the GER began to consider ways of alleviating the problem. The Liverpool Street site and its approaches were already full utilised, with no room for additional or extended platforms, more tracks or an enlarged station concours. Consideration was given to electrification, following the model of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway which had electrified its inner suburban routes between 1909 and 1912 and so been able to run both more and faster services on existing infrastructure. However the high capital costs required of electrifying the GER&#x27;s much more extensive and wider-reaching suburban network - estimated at £3 million (£140 million in 2021) - were beyond the perennially cash-strapped GER&#x27;s resources. Before the war the GER had recruited the American executive Henry Worth Thornton - former superintendent of the Long Island Rail Road (in many ways an American counterpart to the GER, operating an intensive commuter service in and out of New York City) - as its general manager. Working with operations superintendent F.V. Russell (former chief designer at Stratford Works), Thornton developed a way of comprehensively overhauling and optimising the Great Eastern&#x27;s suburban service to increase capacity on the existing infrastructure with minimal investment.

At Liverpool street tracks were rearranged and new junctions between running lines added to improve capacity and flexibility. Small refuge tracks were added at the platform ends to stable locomotives between duties without blocking running lines, signalling was expanded to allow more than one train to occupy a platform road at a time and on the station concourse the passenger barriers were moved back to both direct outward-going passengers more effectively to their trains and to encourage outward-going passengers to leave the station without getting in the way of other streams of people leaving or joining other trains.

Improvements to the rolling stock were made on services running to Chingford. Enfield and Wood Green (Palace Gates). Trains were reformed into sets of 16 four-wheel coaches with each train having seating capacity for 848 people, with additional standing room in peak hours. These were non-corridor compartment-type coaches, but in for third class the compartment dividing walls were cut down to the level of the tops of the seats, allowing more nimble passengers to climb over the seat backs between seating bays to find empty seats. This meant that passengers no longer had to find a compartment with vacant seats before boarding which reduced the dwell time - Thornton and Russell aimed to get the time spent at intermediate stops down from minutes to seconds. To help with this the coaches had their doors painted in different colours to identify the class of each compartment - first class were painted yellow and second class for blue, with the third class accommodation which made up the majority of all the GER&#x27;s trains being unmarked. Similarly, a system of coloured boards representing the destination and/or route of each train was introduced, with the boards being fitted to the rear and sides of the guard&#x27;s van which would be nearest the concourse at Liverpool Street and enable passengers to quickly find and board their train.

The GER had already adopted the Westinghouse air brake due to its greater effectiveness and quicker response when making frequent stops in suburban services. Thornton and Russell instructed drivers to adopt a new technique of running into stations at speed, fully applying the brake as the engine reached the start of the platform, then fully releasing the brake as it approached the end, which would bring the train to a rapid but smooth stop with the engine right at the end of the platform. This would shave further crucial seconds of the time required for each intermediate stop when compared to the more usual technique of cutting speed on the approach to stations, making an initial part-application of the brake and easing the train to a stop. However, with the new method there was very little room for error and drivers had to learn exactly when to apply the brake (and by exactly what amount) and when to release it in order to bring the train to a stop without under- or over-shooting the stopping point and without jolting the train and its passengers.

The new services were introduced in July 1920. When fully combined these improvements and alterations allowed 24 suburban trains to use Liverpool Street each hour - over 40,000 passengers when inward and outward flows were combined. This was a world record for a steam-hauled railway system. On arrival, the engine that had brought the train in would immediately be uncoupled, while another engine was attached at the other end - in many cases this engine would have followed the train into the platform through the station approaches, having been let out of a holding siding to run close behind by the new signalling arrangements. The detached engine would be topped up with water from a newly installed water column at the concourse end of each platform road. As the train departed, the now-available engine would follow it down the platform before being sent either to one of the refuge bays in the platform ends or to a siding at the approaches to follow another arriving service into another platform in its turn. In most cases engines were not kept at Liverpool Street for more than ten minutes between duties. Each individual train was arranged to spend as little as four minutes at the terminus between arrival and departure. This intensity of service is all the more remarkable when it is considered that the vast majority of the suburban services were concentrated in only four of Liverpool Street&#x27;s 18 platforms, with the remainder being used for outer suburban and mainline services.

In total, Thornton and Russell&#x27;s new optimised service provided an increase in capacity of between 50 and 75 per cent without any major changes to infrastructure, no new rolling stock and a total cost of only £80,000 (£3.6 million in 2020 - only a fortieth of the projected cost of electrification). The new suburban services were popular with passengers and the press (which had frequently criticised the GER in the pre-WW1 years for overcrowding and slow journey times, even to the extent of running long-term campaigns against the company). The clashing bright colours of the painted doors and the identification boards were seen as a distinctive feature of the new services from the start and early GER publicity referred to &#x27;The Rainbow Service&#x27;. However the appearance was thought of as &#x27;jazzy&#x27; in the slang of the period and a local newspaper called the service The Jazz, which quickly became widely used.

The service was initially operated by the GER&#x27;s existing stud of 2-4-2T engines such as the M15 and G69 while carriages were adapted versions of either existing four-wheelers or new-builds to these older designs. The GER had always intended to introduce more powerful engines and more modern and higher-capacity carriages to The Jazz to maximise the improvements. New 0-6-2 L77 Class tank engines were introduced from 1921, along with new eight-wheel 57 ft-long (17.3 metres) compartment coaches (with the added refinement of steam heating for winter use), which had their class identification colours painted in a strip between the windows and the roof rather than on the doors. By 1924 over 280,000 people were using The Jazz every day and Liverpool Street was regularly handling over 40,000 passengers per hour in peak periods. When the GER was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 the LNER began introducing articulated car sets of even higher capacity to a design developed by the Great Northern Railway.

The true Jazz services only lasted until 1926 when the service frequency and intensity was cut down due to the General Strike and rising competition from trams, trolley buses, motorbuses and private cars meant that the service on the former GER suburban lines was never brought back up to its planned level. Nonetheless, the services remained widely known as The Jazz and even in the 1940s was still running 18 trains per hour and between 160,000 and 180,000 passengers used Liverpool Street each day. Plans to electrify the former GER system had been developed in the 1930s and were put into action under British Railways. Liverpool Street received its first electric lines in 1946 and electric suburban services - finally replacing The Jazz - began in 1960.

The GER also operated suburban services out of Fenchurch Street station with trains to North Woolwich, Blackwall (until 1925) Gallions and Loughton sharing the station with the London Tilbury and Southend until 1912 when the Midland railway took over operation of that railway.

===Named trains===
The Cathedrals Express operated from Liverpool Street via Cambridge, Ely, Lincoln and Doncaster to York. Three services were run each day although it was never a particularly well patronised service.

The North Country Continental operated between Harwich and Manchester Piccadilly usually being routed via March and the GNGEJR route.
This train included the first restaurant car on the Great Eastern (in 1891) and this was also the first service in the UK to allow third-class passengers to dine. A new train set was built for this service in 1906 and generally operated in the following formation:

ENGINE+THIRD CLASS BRAKE+CORRIDOR THIRD+OPEN THIRD+KITCHEN AND OPEN FIRST+SEMI-OPEN FIRST+SIX WHEEL BRAKE (this constituted the York section). Then followed various corridor composite brakes followed each detached from the rear of the northbound train en route. These were for LIVERPOOL (detached Doncaster on the outward journey)+ LIVERPOOL + MANCHESTER(detached at Lincoln and routed via the Great Central routes) + BIRMINGHAM (via Midland Railway routes) + BIRMINGHAM (via London and North Western routes)(both of which were detached at March).

The Norfolk Coast Express operated between Cromer and Liverpool Street and a purpose-built train was built for this service in 1907. This was the first formation without six-wheeler carriages in the 12-car formation, which included eight carriages for Cromer, two for Sheringham and two for Mundesley. The portions were detached at North Walsham.

However whether all (or indeed any) of these trains carried nameboards in Great Eastern days is doubtful.

===Branch line services===
Typically branch line services were worked by small tank engines usually with ancient carriages handed down from main line or suburban services. Generally many branch services would be timed to connect to services to the main line thus providing through journeys. Many rural branch lines had no more than a handful of services each day.

For instance in the July 1922 Bradshaws Timetable Guide, Table 316 showed five departures from Framlingham at 07:20, 08:30, 12:40, 16:25 and 18:30. All services had connections to London Liverpool Street. All trains called at the two stations on the branch, taking 18 minutes to get to the junction station at Wickham Market.

From Wickham Market the trains departed at 07:56, 09:35, 13:14, 17:52 and 19:10. All services except the 09:35 departure had a connection from London Liverpool Street.

In 1865, when the Saffron Walden Railway opened, the GER provided some of its most modern rolling stock on opening day before reverting to stock of more dubious quality for general operation of the line.

===Other services===
The GER ran a number of trains from Ely and Cambridge to St Pancras after the Midland Railway completed the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway in 1880. in 1914 there were three express services from St Pancras to Cambridge (12:22 pm 2:40 pm and 5:05 pm) with the 12:22 pm reaching Cambridge in a creditable 71 minutes. Suspended during the First World War, these were briefly revived but stopped running in 1922.

Royal trains were also worked from St Pancras to Sandringham in Norfolk, and race day trains to Newmarket also operated into St Pancras.

The GER also operated services from Liverpool Street via the East London Line to New Cross and New Cross Gate with some services being extended to East Croydon.

===Freight traffic===
As the GER served a predominantly rural area, the majority of outward traffic was agricultural in nature. The opening of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint railway in 1882 gave the GER access to the coal fields in South Yorkshire and East Nottinghamshire and this became an important source of traffic for the railway.

There were a number of ports on the GER including King&#x27;s Lynn, Great Yarmouth, Lowestoft, Felixstowe and Parkeston Quay. Fish traffic emanated from Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth.

One of the more obscure services the GER offered was the delivery of sea water. This service started in the 1870s and by 1880 it was reported that had been delivered on a single day. A redundant steam locomotive was employed in the task at Lowestoft and a number of fish and open carriage wagons were converted to saltwater tanks. The trains ran to London where the water was distilled into barrels and sold for sixpence (pre decimalisation price c. 1880, about £ in ). The sea water was used in baths and was still running as late as 1910 although the exact final date of operation is unknown.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 3 August 1863, a passenger train ran into a bullock near North Wootton station. Five passengers were killed as a result with the poor state of the rolling stock being partially to blame.
* On 26 September 1865, a light engine returning from Great Yarmouth to Ipswich derailed between Darsham and Halesworth killing the driver and fireman.
* On 3 September 1881, there was a collision at Bow Road where a train ran into the back of a stationary train which had failed at the station. The driver and fireman of the moving train were killed and 11 passengers injured. In the inquiry that followed the cause was deemed to be the failure of the signalman to protect the rear of the train by placing signals to danger. The train crew however were criticised in that while they had noticed the signals were not at danger, they had failed to inform the signalman. The guard of the failed train was criticised for not having properly protected the rear of that train.
*On 6 August 1889, there was an accident between Bishopsgate and Liverpool Street when an up passenger service ran into the back of a stationary empty coaching stock train. The enquiry was unable to determine the exact cause of the accident due to conflicting witness statements.
*On 17 October 1891, a passenger train was derailed at Lavenham, Suffolk. During recovery operations, a crane was derailed.

* On 24 December 1891, an accident occurred at Barnby Box (between Beccles and Carlton Colville) with three killed and four injuries.
* On 25 September 1900 at Westerfield 0845, GER Class Y14 0-6-0 locomotive No. 522 which was then just a year old stopped at a signal on the Ipswich side of the level crossing awaiting a route to the Felixstowe branch. Shortly afterwards the boiler exploded killing driver John Barnard and his fireman William Macdonald, both based at Ipswich engine shed. The boiler was thrown forwards, over the level crossing and ended up on the down platform. Apparently the locomotive had a history of boiler problems although in the official report the Boiler Foreman at Ipswich Engine shed was blamed. The victims were buried in Ipswich cemetery and both their gravestones have a likeness of a Y14 0-6-0 carved onto them.
* On 5 April 1905, two trains collided on the junction directly north of Stratford Market station with the goods engine overturning and crushing its fireman William Secker. The driver of the other train had mistakenly started his train thinking the signal was in his favour.
*On 1 September 1905, an express passenger train was derailed at , Essex due to a platelayer&#x27;s error. Eleven people were killed and 71 were injured.
*On 9 January 1913, William Harwood, whilst on shift at Lowestoft station, was struck by an overhanging footstep and fell onto the track. Harwood was run over by a passing carriage, resulting in him losing his left leg and breaking his right.
*On 12 July 1913, an express passenger train collided with a light engine at , Essex due to a signalman&#x27;s error. Three people were killed and fourteen were injured.
*On 1 January 1915, an express passenger train overran signals and collided with a local passenger train at , Essex. Ten people were killed and over 500 were injured.

==Rolling stock and other material==

===Locomotives===
====Prior to 1862====

Prior to 1862 the companies that had built the various parts of the network operated locomotives from a variety of engineering companies. Generally the wheel arrangements were and for most classes of locomotives. It was not until 1850 that the Eastern Counties Railway under Gooch built a locomotive at the then newly opened Stratford Works. Number 20 was the first of a class of six locomotives (although three more were also built by R B Longridge and Co of Bedlington, Northumberland). Slightly bigger improved versions of the class followed in 1853 and 1854.

In 1859 Sinclair (Chief mechanical engineer (CME) of the Eastern Counties Railway and later first CME of the Great Eastern) started some form of standardisation with the Y Class locomotives, of which 110 were built by various engineering firms (including one French firm). The last locomotives of this class were withdrawn in 1894.

====1862 to 1880====
Sinclair&#x27;s first design for the GER was the W class single drivers built between 1862 and 1867 by a number of engineering firms. Two of these locomotives were rebuilt from the to a configuration later in their lives and these two, plus one of the original locomotives, carried a canary yellow livery. Another member of this class carried a cream livery &quot;encircled by garlands of roses&quot; when it was used to haul a special train in 1863 for the Prince and Princess of Wales (Edward VII and Queen Alexandria) after their marriage at Westminster Abbey. These locomotives were responsible for running express services on the Great Eastern and in later life worked the Cathedrals Express to Lincoln and York.

Scrapping began in 1883 with the last two locomotives being withdrawn in 1894. The only other classes of locomotive that Sinclair designed were a class of five engines built for the North Woolwich line and a class of engines known as Scotchmen because they were built by Neilson,Reid &amp; Co of Glasgow. Both classes entered service in 1864/65.

Generally Great Eastern locomotives carried a pea-green livery with black lining at this time.

When Johnson took over as CME, the GER was so short of locomotives that he persuaded the North British Railway to let the GER have five locomotives of a class being built by the Neilson, Reid &amp; Co for them on loan. These formed the basis of the 40 strong &#x27;little Sharpie&#x27; (or Number 1) class, with 10 being built by Stratford Works and the other 30 by Sharp Stewart hence the nickname. The GER was working many trains on the London Tilbury and Southend Railway at this time and the Sharpies were deployed on this traffic. The last two were withdrawn in 1913.

The next Johnson class was an goods engine (Class 417) introduced in 1867 and 1868 and numbering 60 engines. A number of these engines had hinged chimneys for use through Silvertown tunnel on the North Woolwich line which had limited headroom. Scrapping began in 1888 with the final locomotive withdrawn in 1899.

Another more powerful design followed in 1872/3 and was known as the 477 class. Introduced in 1872 and 1873, this 50-strong class was built by 5 different companies, and was notable for being the first GER engines with a six-wheeled tender. All were withdrawn between 1898 and 1902.

The growth of London suburban traffic saw a requirement for additional tank engines. The GER borrowed some Metropolitan Railway A Class engines in the early 1870s and had 15 T7 class engines built, followed by some engines, one of which was the first locomotive to carry the distinctive GER Royal Blue livery.

The final locomotives introduced by Johnson were two C8 class locomotives which were built with no engine brakes and no dedicated tenders. These locomotives, numbers 305 and 306, were frequently used on royal trains and finished their careers as station pilots at St Pancras and Liverpool Street.

The 0-4-4T 61 class was the first Adams engine, and these 50 engines were built for suburban traffic. Ten locomotives (Class 61) followed between 1877 and 1879 and these lasted until 1907. Adams next design was a class known as Ironclads. Unfortunately these were not very successful on passenger traffic and were soon deployed on freight workings.

The next Adams locomotive was the first UK locomotive built in 1877. Another failure, this class of 15 locomotives were withdrawn after a working life of eight years, mostly working coal traffic between Peterborough and London.

Adams was succeeded by Massey Bromley who made the decision that henceforth more locomotives would be built at Stratford Works. Up to this point only 80 had been built.

However Bromley&#x27;s first class of locomotives were built by Dubs and Kitson with 12 allocated to Stratford and four each to Norwich and Yarmouth sheds. One of these locomotives was later equipped with oil-burning capabilities, but the increasing demands of railway traffic saw these engines withdrawn by 1893 after a relatively short life. Bromley also designed an class which lasted some 24 years in traffic. He also designed the E10 class some of which were fitted with condensing gear and operated over the East London Line to New Cross and East Croydon.

====1880 to 1922====


Between 1880 and 1922 the Great Eastern produced some distinctive locomotives, and several of these have been preserved. Almost all of the Great Eastern&#x27;s locomotives were, after 1880, built at Stratford Works and many lasted until the end of steam on the Great Eastern.

Express services on the GER were latterly in the hands of the Class S69 (LNER class B12) locomotives. Designed by James Holden and also known as the &#x27;1500 class&#x27;, these engines were built at Stratford Works (51 engines) and William Beardmore (20 engines). Ten engines were later built for the London and North Eastern Railway by Beyer Peacock, and it is one of these locomotives that is preserved today.

These locomotives were built to succeed the three classes of employed by the GER on express services which were becoming heavier as the railways prospered. Classes S46, D56 and H88 (LNER D14, D15, and D16) were collectively nicknamed &quot;Claud Hamiltons&quot; because the first S46 (built at Stratford in 1900, numbered 1900) was named after the then-current chairman of the GER, Lord Claud Hamilton. Most of the &quot;Clauds&quot; were later rebuilt by the LNER; the final one was withdrawn in 1960 and scrapped.

Local suburban traffic was dealt with by numerous 2-4-2T and 0-6-0T locomotives belonging to several different classes. Stratford Engine Shed, for instance, had 163 2-4-2T engines of four classes. As trains got heavier, these locomotives were replaced by the Class L77 0-6-2T (LNER N7) designed by Alfred John Hill and introduced in 1915. 134 were built, including a number after the LNER took over in 1923; one is preserved. The 2-4-2Ts, of which none survive, were mostly cascaded out of suburban traffic by the 1940s and worked until the late 1950s on branch lines.

Mention should also be made of the T26 (LNER E4) s, which remained in service as the last locomotives of this wheel arrangement in Great Britain. Derived from the larger T19 , 100 of these locomotives were built between 1891 and 1902 and worked a variety of trains across East Anglia. The last one, GER no. 490, was preserved as part of the National Collection when withdrawn in 1959. Today it resides at Bressingham Steam Museum, Norfolk. Some of the T19s, incidentally, were rebuilt as s (class T19R) between 1905 and 1908, having been taken off express work by the &quot;Claud Hamiltons&quot;. As LNER class D13, the last worked until 1944.

GER goods designs of this period were invariably tender engines. The main freight class built by the GER was Worsdell&#x27;s Y14 (LNER J15) class. 289 examples were produced between 1883 and 1913 with most being built at Stratford Works, although a small number were built by Sharp Stewart. On 10–11 December 1891, the Great Eastern Railway&#x27;s Stratford Works built one of these locomotives and had it in steam with a coat of grey primer in just 9 hours 47 minutes; this remains a world record. The locomotive then went off to run on Peterborough to London coal trains before coming back to the works for the final coat of paint. It lasted 40 years and ran a total of 1. As freight traffic grew heavier after 1900, more 0-6-0 freight locomotives were built including classes F48 (LNER J16), E72 (LNER J18), G58 (LNER J17) and D81 (LNER J20); the Y14s, meanwhile, went into general local and branch line service, on both passenger and freight trains. The last Y14s ran until 1962, and no. 564 is preserved on the North Norfolk Railway; and G58 no. 1217 (withdrawn 1962) is in the National Railway Museum, York.

Shunting was generally in the hands of locomotives although of note were the Class J70 tram engines employed at Ipswich docks and on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway. This class of locomotive was later the inspiration of the Reverend Awdry&#x27;s Toby the tram engine.

Finally mention must be made of the Decapod which was the first built in Britain, and possibly the only locomotive built for purely political purposes in order to block the passage through Parliament of a new rival scheme for an electric railway.

====Livery====
In the early years, the Great Eastern locomotive livery changed often, first being held in various shades of green and later black. In 1882 the well-known Ultramarine Blue livery was introduced. It consisted of Ultramarine Blue over an undercoat of French Grey, with black smokebox and vermillion buffer beams and lining. From 1915 locos were not given a top coat and ran in French Grey undercoat but with the boiler bands picked out in black.

====Locomotive stock (1923)====

Numbers of each GER locomotive class and running numbers (first and last numbers only) in 1922, prior to the 1923 Grouping. Note that the numbering is not necessarily contiguous:

====Preserved locomotives====

The following GE locomotives are preserved:

 there are plans to build a replica steam locomotive - a class M15 .

===Coaching stock===
Whilst not being at the forefront of carriage development, there were a number of interesting developments on the GER worth noting.

====Main line====

Even by 1900 bogie coaches were rare on GER, with trains of six-wheelers being the norm. It was not until 1897 that the first bogie stock appeared, and these were a comparatively short long. They contained two first-class compartments with lavatories sandwiched between four third-class compartments and a luggage compartment. The GER supplied separate luggage compartments for most of its main line stock. In 1900 an updated version had a corridor and third-class access to the lavatories but no corridor connections to other carriages.

In 1904 Stratford produced a complete corridor train (this means a person can walk from the first to the last carriage whilst the train is moving). Despite the trend to bogied stock, Stratford still included three 6-wheeler carriages and a 4-wheeled luggage van in this formation. The other vehicles were all bogied stock and included a kitchen car. This train was also fitted for steam heating throughout and was employed on Liverpool Street - Parkeston Quay services.

In 1906 a new train set was produced for the North Country Continental train (see below) and in 1907 for the Norfolk Coast Express (see below). The latter was notable for being the first all corridor set built by Stratford Works. However, with the restaurant sets built in 1900 being corridor coaches, more corridor coaches were being added to main line sets.

The livery of the stock was teak (effectively varnished wood) but in 1919 the decision was taken to paint all stock dark red. At the grouping in 1923 however all stock reverted to the teak livery.

====Pullman====
The introduction of Pullman cars to the GER was the idea of American General Manager Henry Worth Thornton. These were tried across the network and required payment of a supplementary fare. Unfortunately it was not a success although they were used on Liverpool Street - Harwich Continental trains for many years.

====Dining and restaurant====
In 1891 the Great Eastern introduced the first restaurant car to its North Country Continental service.

In 1899 Stratford Works produced four restaurant car sets consisting of three cars vestibuled together but without any corridor connections. This meant passengers had to spend the whole journey in the restaurant car. These were employed on services from Cromer and Yarmouth to Liverpool Street.

====Suburban====

In 1900 the majority of GER suburban trains were composed of four-wheeler carriages.

Interior design was spartan and around 1900 third-class passengers sat on bare boards five abreast, second-class passengers on cushions also five abreast, while first-class passengers sat four abreast and enjoyed more legroom. In 1899 James Holden produced the first six passengers sat abreast carriages in a 13-carriage, third-class only train (each carriage was long and wide and had five compartments). This set, which also included such modern features as slam lock doors and gas tail lamps became the model for future suburban carriage design.

In 1899 Holden built the first GER all-bogied suburban train and although a success, the next one did not follow until 1911.

The GER made every effort to maximise the capacity of its suburban carriages to deal with the rise in usage. In the early 1900s some four-wheeler carriages were cut in half longitudinally and a section inserted to make them wider in order to increase the capacity.
More bogied suburban trains followed in 1911 and were deployed on the Ilford, Gidea Park and Loughton services. By 1915 A. J. Hill instigated a policy of converting old four-wheel carriages into bogied stock and some 500 four-wheeled carriages were converted this way. The GER had a reputation for doing things on the cheap and this certainly was cheaper than building new stock.

===Ships===
The GER also operated a number of ferries.

===Cranes===
The GER had a total of 11 breakdown cranes. Numbers 1a, 2a and 3a were built at Stratford Works in 1885 initially as hand cranes. They were converted to steam cranes at Stratford c 1905/06 and lasted into LNER days.

Three examples built by Cowans, Sheldon &amp; Company were purchased between 1892 and 1899. With lifting capacity of they were employed on permanent way work.

Three more cranes (numbers 4a, 5a and unnumbered) were also built at Stratford c1907. The unnumbered example was lost at sea during the First World War whilst in War Department use. All three cranes had a lifting capacity of and were used as breakdown cranes. 4a and 5a worked from Ipswich (until 1967) and March (until 1962).

The last two cranes (number 6a and SB4) were built by Ransomes &amp; Rapier of Ipswich in 1913 and 1919. With a lifting capacity of both were employed on railway work until the 1960s. During LNER days SB4 was frequently used at publicity events to give people an aerial ride in an old wagon body. While 6a was transferred away from the GER shortly after 1923, SB4 was allocated to Stratford, Norwich and March before moving north to the Sheffield area.

===Buses and horses===
The May 1911 issue of the &quot;Great Eastern Railway Magazine&quot; (the in-house magazine of the GER) stated the company had 1,750 horses the majority of which worked in the London area. Some wagon shunting work was carried out by horses but they would have found widespread work hauling delivery carts.

The Great Eastern built buses at Stratford and ran a number of omnibus services including Halesworth to Southwold.

==Hotels and other business interests==
The GER owned five hotels at the end of their existence in 1922.

===The Great Eastern Hotel===
The Great Eastern Hotel was located at Liverpool Street Railway station opened in May 1884 and enlarged in 1901. This was the biggest hotel on the system.
The large function room known as the Hamilton Hall was restored in the 1990s and re-opened as a pub. The hotel is still open today.
===The Felix Hotel===
The Felix Hotel located in Felixstowe was purchased by the GER in the 1920s. Built by the local Tollemache family (of brewing fame) in 1902, the hotel was lavishly equipped with tennis courts, winter gardens, a putting course, croquet lawns and a squash court. Hugely popular when Felixstowe was a resort by the 1930s it was in decline and sold to Fisons in 1952. Visitors included Kaiser Wilhelm in 1891 and in later post GER days, Wallis Simpson and Fred Perry. In the 1980s the building - then named Harvest House – was converted to apartments.

===The Harwich Hotel===
This was opened in 1865 and, although well-equipped and furnished, struggled to make a profit (especially after Parkeston Quay opened). The GER tried to sell it in early 1907 but it failed to meet its reserve price so closed in July 1907.

The GER refurbished the hotel and re-opened it in 1912 but when the First World War started in 1914 it became a naval hospital. After the war the GER opened the hotel again, but it closed in 1923. It was later used as council offices.

===The Parkeston Quay Hotel===
This hotel was opened in 1883 when the continental steamer services were transferred from Harwich. It had 26 rooms. It was part of the station buildings – later used as shipping agent&#x27;s offices.

===Sandringham Hotel===
The Sandringham Hotel at Hunstanton was opened on 1 May 1876 and built by the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway. It was not acquired by the GER until 1 July 1890 when an act of parliament incorporated the Hunstanton and West Norfolk Railway. The GER expanded the premises in the early 1900s with rooms numbering over 100. The hotel prospered until the Second World War where it first housed the LNER Accounts department and was then requisitioned by the War department and used by various British and Canadian regiments during the rest of the war.

It was bought by Hunstanton Urban District Council in 1950 and used as offices and a library until 1959 when the property was converted into flats. The building was demolished in 1967.

===Laundry===
The GER built a laundry in 1888 in Colchester that supplied the hotels with bed linen, tablecloths etc. At one point it employed 70 people.

===Farming===
During 1916 the GER ran a poultry demonstration trains throughout East Anglia often visiting towns on market day. The purpose of this train was to encourage self-sufficiency during the food shortages of the First World War. Encouraged by the reception this train got, the GER purchased Dodnash Priory Farm in Bentley, Suffolk as a poultry demonstration farm. The hen houses were built at Stratford Works and had individual works numbers. By 1920 the farm was producing 40,000 eggs per month for the GER as well as chickens, turkeys, fruit and vegetables for the GER hotels, restaurants, dining cars and buffets. Another establishment at Chigwell has been doing this for some years previously.

Dodnash Priory also served as a rest home for GER horses. A siding about three-quarters of a mile south of Bentley railway station on the down side served the farm.

The farm survived into LNER days being sold in 1927 when the farmer reached 70 and retired. The siding had been removed in May 1925.

=== Stratford Market ===
Stratford Market was founded by the GER in 1879 as a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as a competitor to the City of London&#x27;s Spitalfields Market. The market also had an extensive goods depot and a nearby railway station.

<text>Olaf Dreyer (born 1969, Hamburg) is a German theoretical physicist whose research interests include quantum gravity and the quantum measurement problem. Dreyer received his Ph.D. in quantum gravity in 2001 from the Pennsylvania State University under the direction of Abhay Ashtekar. Subsequently, he has held a postdoctoral fellowship at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, a Marie Curie Fellowship at Imperial College, London, and a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Theoretical Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In 2002 Dreyer proposed a connection between the Barbero-Immirzi parameter in loop quantum gravity and the asymptotic behaviour of black hole quasinormal modes (in numerical general relativity), building on previous insights due to Shahar Hod. Subsequently, Lubos Motl proved that the exact asymptotic behaviour of the quasinormal modes of the Schwarzschild black hole was as predicted numerically.

Dreyer has developed an approach to quantum gravity known as &quot;internal relativity&quot;.

<text>The Chamber of Deputies () is the lower house of the Congress of the Dominican Republic. Together, it and the Senate comprise the legislature of the Dominican Republic.
The composition and powers of the House are established by Constitution of the Dominican Republic. The Chamber is composed of deputies who are divided in 178 by province, five nationally, and seven overseas.

The Chamber is charged with the passage of national legislation, known as laws, which, after concurrence by the Senate, are sent to the President of the Dominican Republic for consideration. In addition to this basic power, the Chamber has certain exclusive powers of which include the power to initiate all laws related to revenue, the Impeachment of officers elected by popular vote, the Senate or the National Council of the Magistracy who are sent to trial the Senate.

The lower chamber was called Tribunado 1844–1854, then Chamber of Representatives 1854–1878, and Chamber of Deputies since 1878.

==Composition (2020–2024)==
On 5 July 2020, 190 deputies were elected, including 178 by provincial districts, five by national at-large voting, and seven by Overseas Deputies. This list contains the changes that occurred after the election until 1 July 2021.

<doc id="648020" wikidata="Q2609758" url="?curid=648020" title="Carlo Bonomi">
<text>Carlo Bonomi (12 March 1937 – 6 August 2022) was an Italian voice actor who was best known for his voiceover work as the voice of Mr. Linea in the animated series &quot;La Linea&quot; as well as Pingu and various other characters in series 1–4 of the stop-motion children&#x27;s television series of the same name.

==Career==
Bonomi voiced many characters for the Italian advertising show &quot;Carosello&quot;. The language of noises he had developed and used for the earlier Osvaldo Cavandoli&#x27;s &quot;La Linea&quot; from 1971 to 1986 was reinterpreted for the acclaimed TV series &quot;Pingu&quot; on SF DRS during its first four seasons produced between 1990 and 2000, where Bonomi voiced all the characters without a script. His grammelot was originally intended to be a parody of the Milanese dialect, and it was inspired by three abstract languages traditionally used by clowns in France and Italy.

When in 2003 the show&#x27;s rights were acquired by HIT Entertainment, Bonomi was replaced by London-based voice actors David Sant and Marcello Magni.

In 1984, he provided the laughter voices for the cartoon series &quot;Stripy&quot;. In 1985, he recorded the railway announcements for the central station of Milan, which remained in use until 2008. Bonomi was also very active as a voice actor in Italian radio dramas, and was the Italian voice for several popular cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Fred Flintstone.

In 2008, he acted the voices for the yellow tribe in &quot;Spore&quot;, which was also his final role before his retirement from acting later that year.

==Death==
Bonomi died on 6 August 2022 in his home town in Milan, Italy, at the age of 85.

<text>Nima Arkani-Hamed (; born April 5, 1972) is an Iranian-American-Canadian theoretical physicist, with interests in high-energy physics, quantum field theory, string theory, cosmology and collider physics. Arkani-Hamed is a member of the permanent faculty at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He is also director of the Carl P. Feinberg Cross-Disciplinary Program in Innovation at the Institute and director of The Center for Future High Energy Physics (CFHEP) in Beijing, China.

==Early life==
Arkani-Hamed&#x27;s parents, Jafargholi &quot;Jafar&quot; Arkani-Hamed and Hamideh Alasti are both physicists from Iran. His father, a native of Tehran, had worked for the Apollo program in the early 1970s, was chairman of the physics department at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, and later taught earth and planetary sciences at McGill University in Montreal. Arkani-Hamed was born in Houston and spent the early years of his life between Iran and the United States. He would accompany his father on hikes in Tehran almost every weekend.

Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Arkani-Hamed&#x27;s family decided to return to Iran, as the new Iranian government promised free expression and possibilities. The Cultural Revolution, however, which followed shortly after the 1979 Revolution, resulted in Iran&#x27;s universities being forcefully shut down. Arkani-Hamed&#x27;s father, Jafar, who at the time worked at Sharif University in Tehran, wrote a petition with his colleagues denouncing the closures. Arkani-Hamed&#x27;s father and his colleagues were subsequently blacklisted by the new government; those who were caught were either imprisoned or hanged according to Arkani-Hamed&#x27;s father. His father, who subsequently had to go underground, spent his entire life savings to get himself and his family out of the country. Arkani-Hamed, who was 10-years old at the time, fled with his family to Canada.

==Academic career==
Arkani-Hamed graduated from the University of Toronto with a joint honours degree in mathematics and physics in 1993, and went to the University of California, Berkeley, for his graduate studies, where he worked under the supervision of Lawrence Hall. The majority of his graduate work was on studies of supersymmetry and flavor physics. His Ph.D. dissertation was titled &quot;Supersymmetry and Hierarchies&quot;. He completed his Ph.D. in 1997 and completed his post-doctoral studies in the SLAC Theory Group at Stanford University. During this time he worked with Savas Dimopoulos and Gia Dvali to develop the paradigm of large extra dimensions.

In 1999 he joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley physics department. He took a leave of absence from Berkeley to visit Harvard University beginning January 2001, and stayed at Harvard as a professor from 2002 to 2008. Since 2008, he has been a professor in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

Since 2013, Arkani-Hamed has been a leader in research on the amplituhedron as a geometric structure that simplifies calculations of particle interactions in certain quantum field theories.

In 2021 he became the first Carl P. Feinberg Director of the Cross-Disciplinary Program in Innovation at the Institute for Advanced Study.

==Honors and awards==

In 2003 he won the Gribov Medal of the European Physical Society, and in the summer of 2005 while at Harvard he won the Phi Beta Kappa award for teaching excellence. In 2008, he won the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Prize given at Tel Aviv University to young scientists who have made outstanding and fundamental contributions in Physical Science. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009. He gave the Messenger lectures at Cornell University in 2010, and was an 
A. D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University from 2013 to 2019. In 2012 he was an inaugural awardee of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur, Yuri Milner. He was one of six physicists featured in the award-winning 2013 documentary film 
&quot;Particle Fever&quot;, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2017. In 2021, he was awarded the Sakurai Prize of the American Physical Society.

== Personal views ==
Nima identifies himself as an atheist. On 21 April 2016, he gave a public talk titled, &quot;The Morality of Fundamental Physics&quot; at Cornell University and said:...part of my motivation for giving this talk is that like many physicists, many scientists, I&#x27;m an atheist. But unlike some atheists, I&#x27;m certainly not a militant atheist. And I dislike a lot a certain strand of militant atheism... I don&#x27;t believe in God. I do, however, think that instead of worshiping a vast and unknowable God, we can devote ourselves to this slow unveiling of the vastness of truth in all of its glory...

<text>MiniDVD or 8 cm DVD (also &quot;3 [[inch]] DVD&quot;) is a DVD disc with a reduced diameter of . It has been most commonly used in camcorders due to its compact size. The most common MiniDVDs are single layered and hold 1.4 GB of data, but there are variants that can offer up to 5.2 GB of storage space, through a combination of dual layers and dual sides.

8 cm DVDs were originally used for music videos and as such became known as DVD single, similarly to how 8 cm optical discs were previously used for music singles on compact discs (i.e. CD single and miniCD). However the MiniDVD format has been mostly used as recordable discs in DVD-based camcorders during the 2000s; a single layer disc can record up to 30 minutes of standard definition video. A number of movies and TV shows have also been released on the format in the mid-2000s, usually targeting children using low-cost small players.

Nintendo used a very similar disc-based format for the GameCube.

==MiniDVD capacities==
The most common MiniDVDs are single layered, which can hold 1.46 GB of data, however, there also exists dual layered 2.6 GB versions, dual sided single layer 2.8 GB versions, and dual sided dual layer 5.2 GB versions. A double sided MiniDVD can hold 2.8 GB of data (1.4 GB x 2), however, a dual-layer MiniDVD can only hold 2.6 GB of data due to the limitations when manufacturing dual layered discs. A double sided dual layered disc can hold 5.2 GB of data (2.6 GB x 2), with the MiniDVD-RAM version of the double sided, dual layer disc being able to hold 5.6 GB of data (2.8GB x 2).

Mini DVDs are also available in +R, +R DS, +R DL, +R DL DS, +RW, +RW DS, -R, -R DS, -R DL, -R DL DS, -RW, and -RW DS variants, just like their full sized counterparts. (DL=Double Layer, DS=Double Sided).

<doc id="648035" wikidata="Q1278145" url="?curid=648035" title="Eastern Counties Football League">
<text>The Eastern Counties Football League, currently known as the Thurlow Nunn League for sponsorship purposes, is an English football league at levels 9 and 10 of the English football league system. It currently contains clubs from Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, eastern Hertfordshire, southern Lincolnshire, and north and east London. The league is a feeder to Division One North of the Isthmian League, but may also see sides promoted to the Northern Premier League Midlands Division.

==History==
===Formation===
During the early part of the 20th century there were several leagues covering East Anglia, including the Norfolk &amp; Suffolk League, the East Anglian League, the Essex &amp; Suffolk Border League and the Ipswich &amp; District League, whilst some of the larger clubs (including Ipswich Town and Cambridge Town) played in the Southern Amateur League. Suggestions of forming a league to cover the whole region had been made since the early 1900s, but intensified after Norwich City were promoted to Division Two of the Football League in 1934 and saw a significant rise in attendances. During the 1934–35 season there was a strong movement in Harwich and Ipswich for the formation of such a league and after canvassing, a &#x27;Meeting of Representatives of East Anglian Football Clubs&#x27; was held at the Picture House in Ipswich on 17 February 1935. The ten clubs in attendance were Cambridge Town, Harwich &amp; Parkeston and Ipswich Town from the SAL, Colchester Town and Crittall Athletic from the Spartan League, and Gorleston, Great Yarmouth Town, King&#x27;s Lynn, Lowestoft Town and Norwich CEYMS from the Norfolk &amp; Suffolk League. Although Cambridge Town and Norwich CEYMS later decided against joining, a further four clubs were recruited: Bury Town and Thetford Town from the Norfolk &amp; Suffolk League, Chelmsford City from the London League and Clacton Town from the Ipswich &amp; District League.

===Early years===
The first season commenced on 31 August 1935 and ended with Harwich and Lowestoft level at the top of the league with 26 points each. Although Lowestoft had a better goal average, the championship was decided by a play-off match held at Layer Road on 29 August 1936. The match ended in a 3–3 draw and the two were declared joint champions and allowed to hold the trophy for six months each. At the end of the first season Ipswich left to join the Southern League and were replaced by their reserve team.

At the end of the 1936–37 season there were concerns about the league&#x27;s viability. All five Essex clubs had left to join the newly established Essex County League, whilst Thetford had resigned after finishing bottom of the league, leaving only six remaining clubs. However, four new members (Colchester United reserves, Cromer, Newmarket Town and Norwich CEYMS) were recruited. The following season the league expanded to 13 clubs as three of the Essex clubs rejoined (the Essex County League had been a failure with only five members completing the season and was not continued).

The 1939–40 season started on 26 August, but was abandoned after the outbreak of World War II. After the war ended in May 1945 a meeting was held in late June to see whether the league could be restarted. However, a further meeting on 28 July decided that too few clubs were ready to resume footballing activities as many were unable to sign players and some grounds remained under the control of the armed forces. The league finally resumed for the 1946–47 season with ten clubs.

===Later development===
Prior to the start of the 1948–49 season the league was expanded to 16 clubs, largely through the addition of the &#x27;A&#x27; teams of four London clubs, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United. The following season Gillingham reserves joined, becoming the only Kent-based club to ever play in the league (Dartford also applied to join at the same time, but were rejected). In 1951 the league gained its first Cambridgeshire club with the admission of Cambridge United, and by 1955–56 the league was up to 20 clubs, of which five were reserve or &#x27;A&#x27; teams. Although a succession of clubs leaving the league saw it reduced to fourteen clubs by 1964, it quickly regained numbers and was back up to 18 members two years later. In 1976 the league was renamed the Eastern League, but returned to its original name six years later. The league was among the first to be sponsored by an external company when, in the late 1970s, it was sponsored by local building societies Magnet and Planet, and Town and Country. More recently it has been sponsored by building supplies company Jewson, Ridgeons, and current sponsor Thurlow Nunn.

===Expansion to two divisions===
There had been occasional discussions about adding a second division to the league since its formation, but in 1983 it seemed about to become a reality. However, it was then delayed by the Football Association at the request of the Essex Senior League. The idea was resurrected during the 1987–88 season and a meeting was held to discuss it on 22 November 1987. The league contacted 21 clubs who were considered potential members, of which fifteen were interested in joining. A further four clubs were contacted and another (Long Sutton Athletic) asked for details. Ultimately fourteen clubs applied to join the league; eight from the Peterborough &amp; District League (Downham Town, Huntingdon United, King&#x27;s Lynn reserves, Ortonians, Somersham Town, Warboys Town and Yaxley – Parson Drove also applied later in the year, but were rejected), three from the Anglian Combination (Diss Town, Fakenham Town and Wroxham) and three from the Essex &amp; Suffolk Border League (Bury Town reserves, Hatfield Peverel and Little Oakley). All were accepted except Hatfield Peverel and Little Oakley, whose grounds were deemed inadequate, whilst Ortonians later withdrew after difficulties getting their reserve and &#x27;A&#x27; teams into the Peterborough &amp; District League. Mildenhall Town from the Cambridgeshire League and Ipswich Wanderers from the Ipswich Sunday League were later invited to join, whilst Halstead Town were persuaded to transfer from the Essex Senior League after Ortonian&#x27;s late withdrawal, allowing the inaugural Division One season in 1988–89 to start with 14 clubs.

===Addition of Division One South===
On 3 October 2017, The Football Association ratified the creation of a new Step 6 (level 10) division in the league, Division One South, which started playing in the 2018–19 season. It covers the rest of Essex, as well as East London and parts of North London and east Hertfordshire and is intended to enable promotion to the Essex Senior League and relegation to the Essex Olympian League.

<text>Terpander ( &quot;Terpandros&quot;), of Antissa in Lesbos, was a Greek poet and citharede who lived about the first half of the 7th century BC. He was the father of Greek music and through it, of lyric poetry, although his own poetical compositions were few and in extremely simple rhythms. He simplified rules of the modes of singing of other neighboring countries and islands and formed, out of these syncopated variants, a conceptual system. Though endowed with an inventive mind, and the commencer of a new era of music, he attempted no more than to systematize the musical styles that existed in the music of Greece and Anatolia. Terpander is perhaps the earliest historically certain figure in the music of Ancient Greece.

==Biography==
He gained a reputation as a singer and composer, but after having killed a man in a brawl, he was exiled. 

About the time of the Second Messenian War, he settled in Sparta, to where, according to some accounts, he had been summoned by command of the Delphic Oracle to compose the differences that had arisen between different classes in the state. Here he gained the prize in the musical contests at the festival of Carneia.

He is regarded as the real founder of Greek classical music and lyric poetry, but as to his innovations in music, our information is imperfect. According to Strabo, he increased the number of strings in the lyre from four to seven; others take the fragment of Terpander on which Strabo bases his statement to mean that he developed the citharoedic nomos (sung to the accompaniment of the cithara or lyre) by making the divisions of the ode seven instead of four. The seven-stringed lyre was probably already in existence. Terpander is also said to have introduced several new rhythms in addition to the dactylic and to have been famous as a composer of drinking-songs (skolia).

No poems attributed to Terpander survive complete, and very few lines of his are quoted by later Greek writers; it must be regarded as doubtful whether he worked in writing.

Terpander is said to have died, around Skiades (&quot;shady place&quot; of the Carneia), by choking on a fig when the fruit was thrown in appreciation of one of his performances.

<text>Osculum infame is a witch&#x27;s supposed ritual greeting upon meeting with the Devil. The name means the &#x27;shameful kiss&#x27; or &#x27;kiss of shame&#x27;, since it involved kissing the devil&#x27;s anus, his &quot;other&quot; mouth. According to folklore, it was this kiss that allowed the Devil to seduce women.

==Kiss of shame==

During the era of witch-hunting, many believed that witches worshipped the Devil and paid him homage by kissing his posterior. The &quot;osculum infame&quot; is mentioned in nearly every single recorded account of a Witches&#x27; Sabbath and in confessions – most of which were extracted under torture. Although most common in Europe, no illustrations of it exist in the publications of English persecutions, possibly as torture was not regularly employed in the questioning of those accused. It was called the &quot;kiss of shame&quot; because it was generally regarded as an act of degradation.

According to the allegations, witches would give the kiss of shame at the beginning of the sabbat, after the Devil had read the names of his followers. They would approach him by crawling or walking backwards, turn, bow and kiss his posterior. It was believed that this kiss was required for a new witch to be initiated, and the kiss was followed by feasting.

Sometimes witches kissed not only the Devil&#x27;s fundament, but lower-ranking demons&#x27; as well.

Generally considered to be an act of homage, or respect, the North Berwick witch trials of Scotland in the 16th century held that the kiss was an act of penance issued from the Devil. Reported in &quot;Newes from Scotland, declaring the damnable Life of Doctor Fian&quot; (1592) by W. Wright:

The pamphlet provided the first descriptions of the &quot;osculum infame&quot; to the English population. Belief held that the Devil demanded the kiss of shame in forms other than human, including rams, black cats, and toads. &quot;Errores Haereticorum&quot;, a medieval tract, claims that the Cathars took their name &quot;from the term cat, whose posterior they kiss, in whose form Satan appears to them.&quot; The role could also be reversed whereby the witch was the recipient of the kiss.

<text>In mathematics, the ADE classification (originally &quot;A-D-E&quot; classifications) is a situation where certain kinds of objects are in correspondence with simply laced Dynkin diagrams. The question of giving a common origin to these classifications, rather than a posteriori verification of a parallelism, was posed in . The complete list of simply laced Dynkin diagrams comprises
:formula_1

Here &quot;simply laced&quot; means that there are no multiple edges, which corresponds to all simple roots in the root system forming angles of formula_2 (no edge between the vertices) or formula_3 (single edge between the vertices). These are two of the four families of Dynkin diagrams (omitting formula_4 and formula_5), and three of the five exceptional Dynkin diagrams (omitting formula_6 and formula_7).

This list is non-redundant if one takes formula_8 for formula_9 If one extends the families to include redundant terms, one obtains the exceptional isomorphisms
:formula_10
and corresponding isomorphisms of classified objects.

The &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot; nomenclature also yields the simply laced finite Coxeter groups, by the same diagrams: in this case the Dynkin diagrams exactly coincide with the Coxeter diagrams, as there are no multiple edges.

== Lie algebras ==
In terms of complex semisimple Lie algebras:
* formula_11 corresponds to formula_12 the special linear Lie algebra of traceless operators, 
* formula_13 corresponds to formula_14 the even special orthogonal Lie algebra of even-dimensional skew-symmetric operators, and
* formula_15 are three of the five exceptional Lie algebras.

In terms of compact Lie algebras and corresponding simply laced Lie groups:
* formula_11 corresponds to formula_17 the algebra of the special unitary group formula_18
* formula_13 corresponds to formula_20 the algebra of the even projective special orthogonal group formula_21, while
* formula_15 are three of five exceptional compact Lie algebras.

== Binary polyhedral groups ==
The same classification applies to discrete subgroups of formula_23, the binary polyhedral groups; properly, binary polyhedral groups correspond to the simply laced &quot;affine&quot; Dynkin diagrams formula_24 and the representations of these groups can be understood in terms of these diagrams. This connection is known as the after John McKay. The connection to Platonic solids is described in . The correspondence uses the construction of McKay graph.

Note that the ADE correspondence is &quot;not&quot; the correspondence of Platonic solids to their reflection group of symmetries: for instance, in the ADE correspondence the tetrahedron, cube/octahedron, and dodecahedron/icosahedron correspond to formula_25 while the reflection groups of the tetrahedron, cube/octahedron, and dodecahedron/icosahedron are instead representations of the Coxeter groups formula_26 and formula_27

The orbifold of formula_28 constructed using each discrete subgroup leads to an ADE-type singularity at the origin, termed a du Val singularity.

The McKay correspondence can be extended to multiply laced Dynkin diagrams, by using a &quot;pair&quot; of binary polyhedral groups. This is known as the Slodowy correspondence, named after Peter Slodowy – see .

== Labeled graphs ==
The ADE graphs and the extended (affine) ADE graphs can also be characterized in terms of labellings with certain properties, which can be stated in terms of the discrete Laplace operators or Cartan matrices. Proofs in terms of Cartan matrices may be found in .

The affine ADE graphs are the only graphs that admit a positive labeling (labeling of the nodes by positive real numbers) with the following property:
:Twice any label is the sum of the labels on adjacent vertices.
That is, they are the only positive functions with eigenvalue 1 for the discrete Laplacian (sum of adjacent vertices minus value of vertex) – the positive solutions to the homogeneous equation:
:formula_29
Equivalently, the positive functions in the kernel of formula_30 The resulting numbering is unique up to scale, and if normalized such that the smallest number is 1, consists of small integers – 1 through 6, depending on the graph.

The ordinary ADE graphs are the only graphs that admit a positive labeling with the following property:
:Twice any label minus two is the sum of the labels on adjacent vertices.
In terms of the Laplacian, the positive solutions to the inhomogeneous equation:
:formula_31
The resulting numbering is unique (scale is specified by the &quot;2&quot;) and consists of integers; for E8 they range from 58 to 270, and have been observed as early as .

== Other classifications ==
The elementary catastrophes are also classified by the ADE classification.

The ADE diagrams are exactly the quivers of finite type, via Gabriel&#x27;s theorem.

There is also a link with generalized quadrangles, as the three non-degenerate GQs with three points on each line correspond to the three exceptional root systems &quot;E&quot;6, &quot;E&quot;7 and &quot;E&quot;8.
The classes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; correspond degenerate cases where the line set is empty or we have all lines passing through a fixed point, respectively.

It was suggested that symmetries of small droplet clusters may be subject to an ADE classification.

The minimal models of two-dimensional conformal field theory have an ADE classification.

Four dimensional formula_32 superconformal gauge quiver theories with unitary gauge groups have an ADE classification.

== Extension of the classification ==
Arnold has subsequently proposed many further extensions in this classification scheme, in the idea to revisit and generalize the Coxeter classification and Dynkin classification under the single umbrella of root systems.
He tried to introduce informal concepts of Complexification and Symplectization based on analogies between Picard–Lefschetz theory which he interprets as the Complexified version of Morse theory and then extend them to other areas of mathematics. He tries also to identify hierarchies and dictionaries between mathematical objects and theories where for example diffeomorphism corresponds to the A type of the Dynkyn classification, volume preserving diffeomorphism corresponds to B type and Symplectomorphisms corresponds to C type. 
In the same spirit he revisits analogies between different mathematical objects 
where for example the Lie bracket in the scope of Diffeomorphisms becomes analogous (and at the same time includes as a special case) the Poisson bracket of Symplectomorphism. 

== Trinities ==
Arnold extended this further under the rubric of &quot;mathematical trinities&quot;. McKay has extended his correspondence along parallel and sometimes overlapping lines. Arnold terms these &quot;trinities&quot; to evoke religion, and suggest that (currently) these parallels rely more on faith than on rigorous proof, though some parallels are elaborated. Further trinities have been suggested by other authors. Arnold&#x27;s trinities begin with R/C/H (the real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions), which he remarks &quot;everyone knows&quot;, and proceeds to imagine the other trinities as &quot;complexifications&quot; and &quot;quaternionifications&quot; of classical (real) mathematics, by analogy with finding symplectic analogs of classic Riemannian geometry, which he had previously proposed in the 1970s. In addition to examples from differential topology (such as characteristic classes), Arnold considers the three Platonic symmetries (tetrahedral, octahedral, icosahedral) as corresponding to the reals, complexes, and quaternions, which then connects with McKay&#x27;s more algebraic correspondences, below.

McKay&#x27;s correspondences are easier to describe. Firstly, the extended Dynkin diagrams formula_33 (corresponding to tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral symmetry) have symmetry groups formula_34 respectively, and the associated foldings are the diagrams formula_35 (note that in less careful writing, the extended (tilde) qualifier is often omitted). More significantly, McKay suggests a correspondence between the nodes of the formula_36 diagram and certain conjugacy classes of the monster group, which is known as &quot;McKay&#x27;s E8 observation;&quot; see also monstrous moonshine. McKay further relates the nodes of formula_37 to conjugacy classes in 2.&quot;B&quot; (an order 2 extension of the baby monster group), and the nodes of formula_38 to conjugacy classes in 3.&quot;Fi&quot;24&#x27; (an order 3 extension of the Fischer group) – note that these are the three largest sporadic groups, and that the order of the extension corresponds to the symmetries of the diagram.

Turning from large simple groups to small ones, the corresponding Platonic groups formula_39 have connections with the projective special linear groups PSL(2,5), PSL(2,7), and PSL(2,11) (orders 60, 168, and 660), which is deemed a &quot;McKay correspondence&quot;. These groups are the only (simple) values for &quot;p&quot; such that PSL(2,&quot;p&quot;) acts non-trivially on &quot;p&quot; points, a fact dating back to Évariste Galois in the 1830s. In fact, the groups decompose as products of sets (not as products of groups) as: formula_40 formula_41 and formula_42 These groups also are related to various geometries, which dates to Felix Klein in the 1870s; see icosahedral symmetry: related geometries for historical discussion and for more recent exposition. Associated geometries (tilings on Riemann surfaces) in which the action on &quot;p&quot; points can be seen are as follows: PSL(2,5) is the symmetries of the icosahedron (genus 0) with the compound of five tetrahedra as a 5-element set, PSL(2,7) of the Klein quartic (genus 3) with an embedded (complementary) Fano plane as a 7-element set (order 2 biplane), and PSL(2,11) the (genus 70) with embedded Paley biplane as an 11-element set (order 3 biplane). Of these, the icosahedron dates to antiquity, the Klein quartic to Klein in the 1870s, and the buckyball surface to Pablo Martin and David Singerman in 2008.

Algebro-geometrically, McKay also associates E6, E7, E8 respectively with: the 27 lines on a cubic surface, the 28 bitangents of a plane quartic curve, and the 120 tritangent planes of a canonic sextic curve of genus 4. The first of these is well-known, while the second is connected as follows: projecting the cubic from any point not on a line yields a double cover of the plane, branched along a quartic curve, with the 27 lines mapping to 27 of the 28 bitangents, and the 28th line is the image of the exceptional curve of the blowup. Note that the fundamental representations of E6, E7, E8 have dimensions 27, 56 (28·2), and 248 (120+128), while the number of roots is 27+45 = 72, 56+70 = 126, and 112+128 = 240.
This should also fit into the scheme of relating E8,7,6 with the largest three of the sporadic simple groups, Monster, Baby and Fischer 24&#x27;, cf. monstrous moonshine.

<text>The Randstad (; &quot;Rim City&quot; or &quot;Edge City&quot;) is a roughly crescent- or arc-shaped conurbation in the Netherlands, that includes almost half the country&#x27;s population. With a central-western location, it connects and comprises the Netherlands&#x27; four biggest cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht), their suburbs, and many towns in between, that all grew and merged into each other. Among other things, it includes the Port of Rotterdam (the world&#x27;s busiest seaport outside Asia), the Port of Amsterdam (Europe&#x27;s fourth-busiest seaport), and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. With a population of approximately 8.4 million people it is one of the largest metropolitan regions in Europe, comparable in population size to the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region or the San Francisco Bay Area, and covers an area of approximately . The Randstad had a gross regional domestic product of €510 billion in 2022, making it the second most productive region in the European Union, only behind the Paris metropolitan area. It encompasses both the Amsterdam metropolitan area and Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area. It is part of the larger Blue Banana megalopolis.

The Randstad&#x27;s main cities are Almere, Amsterdam, Delft, Dordrecht, Haarlem, The Hague, Leiden, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. Other towns include Alkmaar, Alphen aan den Rijn, Amersfoort, Amstelveen, Capelle aan den IJssel, Gouda, Heerhugowaard, Hilversum, Hoofddorp, Hoorn, Lelystad, Nieuwegein, Purmerend, Rijswijk, Schiedam, Spijkenisse, Vlaardingen, Zaandam, Zeist, and Zoetermeer.

Although the name Randstad is often translated into English as &quot;edge city&quot; or &quot;border city&quot;, a more accurate translation would be &quot;rim city&quot;. The Dutch name was coined in 1938 by KLM founder Albert Plesman who, while flying over the region, used it to describe a strip of cities at the rim of a large green agricultural area (the Green Heart). While technically more of a crescent (the southeastern edge of the rim is significantly less populated), the ring shape formed by connecting the four major cities of the region led to the use of the name &quot;Ring City&quot;.

== Economy ==

Randstad contributes around half or 53% of the Netherlands total GDP.

==Geography==

Recently, Dutch planners have started to refer to the Randstad as &quot;Deltametropool&quot;. This actually consists of two large metropolitan areas:

===Noordvleugel===
The Noordvleugel (&quot;North Wing&quot;), with a population of around 3.6 million people, consists of the Haarlem and IJmuiden conurbations in the west, Amsterdam at the centre and Almere, the Gooi area and Utrecht in the east. The conurbation of Utrecht (population around one million) can be considered to be part of this wing, but can also be excluded. The cultural centre of the Noordvleugel, however, is notably centered on Amsterdam, which could as such be considered a classical centralistic metropolis. Amsterdam recently started to present itself as the Amsterdam metropolitan area (&quot;Metropoolregio Amsterdam&quot;). The expectation is that the use of the terms Noordvleugel and the Randstad will become less prevalent as a result.

While Utrecht is not the center of the Noordvleugel, it is in fact the center of the whole of the Netherlands itself. While being categorised as part of the Randstad, the Utrecht agglomeration lies relatively further apart, owing to its long history of rivalry with Holland and Amsterdam in particular. Utrecht is much more monocentric than Amsterdam, which has booming satellite cities such as Haarlem and Almere. While Utrecht functions as the gateway to the Randstad for both car and rail transport, it is disconnected from the virtually continuous urbanised zone in western Holland by the protected polder landscape of the Groene Hart. The North Wing of the Randstad is expected to grow more in population than the Zuidvleugel and the Groene Hart areas, with the growth of population also being in effect for a longer period of time, compared to the other two areas.

===Zuidvleugel===
The Zuidvleugel (&quot;South Wing&quot;), with a population of around 3.5 million people, stretches some 60 kilometers from Dordrecht in the southeast to Leiden in the north. The main conurbations are the Rotterdam and The Hague areas. The virtual centre of the Zuidvleugel lies in between these two major cities, near Delft. The first steps toward this development were taken with the construction of a new fast light-rail connection between Rotterdam and The Hague: RandstadRail. A long-delayed extension of the western A4 motorway from the south of Delft to Rotterdam has also been constructed, creating a second connection from Rotterdam, via The Hague, to Amsterdam.

A possible new area would be the Zuidoostflank; parallel to the A2 motorway (from Amsterdam to Eindhoven) and parallel to the A12 motorway (Utrecht to WERV (Wageningen, Ede, Rhenen and Veenendaal)), as this region has much potential to strengthen the knowledge economy of the Randstad.

Over the last few decades, a major topic in the Randstad is the conflict between the cities and the towns in between. These towns and the surrounding countryside, known as the &quot;Groene Hart&quot; (Green Heart), are usually much greener than the cities, they house many commuters that work in the cities and the former strongly depend on the latter for facilities such as hospitals and large scale entertainment. Cities need more space to expand, yet the towns fear losing their identity and autonomy.

=== Boundary issues ===



The Randstad&#x27;s borders have never been officially specified. Some consider only the four most populous cities of the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) part of it, others would say that areas such as Alkmaar (which represents itself as being part of it), Hoorn and Lelystad are also part of this conurbation.

The publication &quot;Randstad 2040&quot;, released by the Government of the Netherlands, reveals that the Noordvleugel (Amsterdam and Utrecht region) is already growing parallel to the A1, A2, and A4 motorways, as well as into the northern part of North Holland (Alkmaar and Hoorn region) and Flevoland (Almere and Lelystad region). There is also a trend shown that the Noordvleugel is expanding parallel to the A2 (Amsterdam towards Eindhoven) and A12 (Utrecht towards the WERV region, encompassing the cities of Wageningen, Ede, Rhenen and Veenendaal) motorways. This region is called the Zuidoostflank (English: Southeastside).

== Culture ==

It is sometimes argued that a cultural divide exists between the Randstad and the rest of the country. This distinction is usually made in relation to Dutch politics and media, who according to critics are mostly interested in the affairs of the Randstad. Both branches (government and media) have their centre in the Randstad; respectively in The Hague and in Hilversum. The Randstad itself, however, does not represent a unified cultural zone. It is not a &#x27;place&#x27; of residence or a carrier of cultural identity. According to the late influential urbanist Niek de Boer, the Randstad simply &#x27;does not exist&#x27;. While the cities and landscapes in the Randstad share some commonalities, there are also large differences originating in centuries of divergent development. There are strong local identities within the region, especially in rural environments.

Politically, the Randstad is broadly right-leaning and conservative, with student cities, including Amsterdam, Utrecht, Haarlem, Leiden and Delft, being more left-leaning and progressive.

The Randstad is home to some of the most reputable universities in Europe, including the University of Amsterdam, the VU Amsterdam, Leiden University, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Utrecht University and the Delft University of Technology.

== Transport ==
The Randstad possesses a large infrastructure system, with many railways, motorways, trams and subways in various cities. It is possible to cycle on reasonably safe and pleasant routes almost everywhere and cycling is a major mode of transport. The Port of Rotterdam, and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, are both major international gateways. There are various smaller ports and airports in the Randstad, like the ports of IJmuiden, Amsterdam and Dordrecht, as well as Rotterdam The Hague Airport.

=== Motorways ===
The Randstad has various motorways, most of them starting around Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Many (inter)national corridors start in the Randstad, including the A1, A2, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A12, A13, A15, A16, A20, A27 and A28 &quot;autosnelwegen&quot;, as well as various commuter routes.

The Randstad network of motorways carry some of the highest traffic volumes in Europe. Until 2005 most motorways used to be no wider than four or six lanes, but from 2005 on capacity of most major highways expanded to six or eight and on some parts even ten lanes. A 14-lane highway is projected near Utrecht. Some hard shoulders are in use as peak hour lanes – traffic is allowed to use the hard shoulder as a third or fourth lane during periods of congestion, when traffic management signs indicate. Since these expansions traffic jams (which used to be quite intense) have been reduced by up to 25%. Traffic on the highway still is quite heavy, though.

Because of the many obstructions in minor roads, such as one-way or circular routes (often created to make living neighbourhoods safer), a lot of local traffic also uses the motorways.

Another growing issue is the number of trucks on the radiating motorways from the Randstad; truck volumes can be as high as 20,000 trucks per day, occupying the entire right lane on some motorways. 

=== Railways ===
The Randstad is the keystone of the Dutch railway network; most intercity connections terminate in one of the key cities in the Randstad. The railway network in the area is dense and heavily used. Together with the Swiss Federal Railways (1st), and the Belgian railways (3rd), the Dutch Railways are in the top 3 of Europe in punctuality. Larger cities in the Randstad have many railway stations, as well as light rail, subway and/or tram networks.

=== Cycling ===
Much effort is being expended in increasing the cycling rate of the Randstad. The campaign Fietsfilevrij exists to encourage cycling as an alternative to waiting in traffic jams on the motorway. Bicycle &quot;superhighways&quot; have been built on which cyclists have priority for long distance, high speed cycle commuting. For instance, one of these stretches the 50 km distance between Amsterdam and Utrecht.

== Notes ==
# Randstad is not an official statistical area. The &#x27;land area&#x27; figure is the sum of the areas of the 4 member provinces. The Randstad is normally not considered to cover the whole of any of these provinces.
# Estimates range from a conservative 7.1 million (agglomerations on the rim of the Groene Hart) to 8.4 million (full population of the 4 member provinces).

<text>Promotion and relegation is used by sports leagues as a process where teams can move up and down among divisions in a league system, based on their performance over a season. Leagues that use promotion and relegation systems are sometimes called open leagues. In a system of promotion and relegation, the best-ranked team(s) in a lower division are &quot;promoted&quot; to a higher division for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the higher division are &quot;relegated&quot; to the lower division for the next season. During the season, teams that are high enough in the league table that they would qualify for promotion are sometimes said to be in the &quot;promotion zone&quot;, and those at the bottom are in the &quot;relegation zone&quot; (colloquially the &quot;drop zone&quot; or &quot;facing the drop&quot;).

An alternate system of league organization, used primarily in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and the United States, is a closed model based on licensing or franchises. This maintains the same teams from year to year, with occasional admission of expansion teams and relocation of existing teams, and with no team movement between the major league and minor leagues.

==Overview==


The number of teams exchanged between the divisions is almost always identical. Exceptions occur when the higher division wishes to change the size of its membership, or has lost one or more of clubs (to financial insolvency or expulsion, for example) and wishes to restore its previous membership size, in which case fewer teams are relegated from that division, or (less often) more teams are accepted for promotion from the division below. Such variations usually cause a &quot;knock-on&quot; effect through the lower divisions. For example, in 1995 the Premier League voted to reduce its numbers by two and achieved the desired change by relegating four teams instead of the usual three, whilst allowing only two promotions from Football League Division One. Even in the absence of such extraordinary circumstances, the pyramid-like nature of most European sports league systems can still create knock-on effects at the regional level. For example, in a higher league with a large geographical footprint and multiple feeder leagues each representing smaller geographical regions, should most or all of the relegated teams in the higher division come from one particular region then the number of teams to be promoted or relegated from each of the feeder leagues may have to be adjusted, or one or more teams playing near the boundary between the feeder leagues may have to transfer from one feeder league to another to maintain numerical balance.

The system is said to be the defining characteristic of the &quot;European&quot; form of professional sports league organization. Promotion and relegation have the effect of allowing the maintenance of a hierarchy of leagues and divisions, according to the relative strength of their teams. They also maintain the importance of games played by many low-ranked teams near the end of the season, which may be at risk of relegation. In contrast, the final games of a low-ranked US or Canadian team serve little purpose, and in fact losing may be beneficial to such teams because they offer a better position in the next year&#x27;s draft.

Although not intrinsic to the system, problems can occur due to the differing monetary payouts and revenue-generating potential that different divisions provide to their clubs. For example, financial hardship has sometimes occurred in leagues where clubs do not reduce their wage bill once relegated. This usually occurs for one of two reasons: first, the club can not move underperforming players on, or second, the club is gambling on being promoted back straight away and is prepared to take a financial loss for one or two seasons to do so. Some leagues (most notably English football&#x27;s Premier League) offer &quot;parachute payments&quot; to its relegated teams for the following year(s). The payouts are higher than the prize money received by some non-relegated teams and are designed to soften the financial hit that clubs take whilst dropping out of the Premier League. However, in many cases, these parachute payments just serve to inflate the costs of competing for promotion among the lower division clubs as newly relegated teams retain a financial advantage.

In some countries and at certain levels, teams in line for promotion may have to satisfy certain non-playing conditions in order to be accepted by the higher league, such as financial solvency, stadium capacity, and facilities. If these are not satisfied, a lower-ranked team may be promoted in their place, or a team in the league above may be saved from relegation.

While the primary purpose of the promotion and relegation system is to maintain competitive balance, it may also be used as a disciplinary tool in special cases. On several occasions, the
Italian Football Federation has relegated clubs found to have been involved in match fixing. This occurred most recently in 2006, when the season&#x27;s initial champions Juventus were relegated to Serie B, and two other teams were initially relegated but then restored to Serie A after appeal (see 2006 Serie A scandal).

As of the 2020s, empirical evidence increasingly pointed to the conclusion that promotion and relegation, standing alone, was insufficient to ensure adequate parity in any given game or the overall financial performance of a sport (as distinguished from individual players or teams). Most importantly, the failure of most association football leagues to adequately regulate individual player compensation (that is, by imposing salary caps) had resulted in too many games ending in predictable blowouts, and thereby reduced the financial value of such games in terms of ticket sales and media rights. This explained why in the 2020s, association football leagues were collectively bringing in annually only about two times the revenue of the National Football League (the wealthiest sports league in the world), even though association football had eight times the number of fans worldwide as American football. It was reportedly because of such evidence that the EuroLeague adopted mandatory salary bands in September 2024. 

===International sport===
Promotion and relegation is used in international sports leagues such as in Europe, and many other parts of the world. It may be used in international sports tournaments. In tennis, the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup have promotion and relegation, with a &#x27;World Group&#x27; (split into two divisions in the Billie Jean King Cup) at the top and series of regional groups at a lower level. The World Groups in both use a knockout tournament format, with the first-round losers entering play-offs with winners from regional groups to avoid relegation. In international tournaments, this format allows teams from countries in which a sport is less well established to have competitive matches, while opening up the possibility of competing against higher ranked nations as a sport grows. Other international tournaments which employ promotion and relegation include the Ice Hockey World Championships, Bandy World Championships, Floorball World Championships, the UEFA Nations League, the CONCACAF Nations League, the World Cricket League and the European Team Championships in athletics.

==Historical comparisons==

===Early baseball leagues in the United States===
In baseball, the earliest American sport to develop professional leagues, the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was established in 1857 as a national governing body for the game. In many respects, it would resemble England&#x27;s Football Association when founded in 1863. Both espoused strict amateurism in their early years and welcomed hundreds of clubs as members.

Baseball&#x27;s National Association was not able to survive the onset of professionalism. It responded to the trend – clubs secretly paying or indirectly compensating players – by establishing a &quot;professional&quot; class for 1869. As quickly as 1871, most of those clubs broke away and formed the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). That new, professional Association was open at a modest fee, but it proved to be unstable. It was replaced by the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs in 1876, which has endured to the present day. The founders of the new League judged that in order to prosper, they must make baseball&#x27;s highest level of competition a franchise based system with exclusive membership, a strict limit on the number of teams, and each member having exclusive rights to their local market.

The modest National League guarantee of a place in the league year after year would permit the owners to monopolize fan bases in their exclusive territories and give them the confidence to invest in infrastructure, such as improved ballparks. In turn, those would guarantee the revenues to support traveling halfway across a continent for games. Indeed, after its first season, the new league banked on its still doubtful stability by expelling its members in New York and Philadelphia (the two largest cities), because they had breached agreements to visit the four western clubs at the end of the season.

The NL&#x27;s dominance of baseball was challenged several times after its first few years, but only by entire leagues. Eight clubs, the established norm for a national league, was a prohibitively high threshold for a new venture. Two challengers succeeded beyond the short-term, with the National League fighting off a challenge from the American Association after a decade (concluded 1891). In 1903 it accepted parity with the American League and the formation of the organization that would become Major League Baseball. The peace agreement between the NL and the AL did not change the &quot;closed shop&quot; of top-level baseball but entrenched it by including the AL in the shop. This was further confirmed by the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1922 ruling in &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot;, giving MLB a legal monopoly over professional baseball in the US.

The other major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada have followed the MLB model of a franchise based system.

===Early football leagues in England===

In contrast to baseball&#x27;s NABBP, the first governing body in English football survived the onset of professionalism, which it formally accepted in 1885. Perhaps the great geographical concentration of population and the corresponding short distances between urban centres was crucial. Certainly it provided the opportunity for more clubs&#x27; developing large fan bases without incurring great travel costs. Professional football did not gain acceptance until after the turn of the 20th century in most of Southern England. The earliest league members travelled only through the Midlands and North.

When The Football League (now the English Football League) was founded in 1888, it was not intended to be a rival of The Football Association but rather the top competition within it. The new league was not universally accepted as England&#x27;s top-calibre competition right away. To help win fans of clubs outside The Football League, its circuit was not closed; rather, a system was established in which the worst teams at the end of each season would need to win re-election against any clubs wishing to join.

A rival league, the Football Alliance, was formed in 1889. When the two merged in 1892, it was not on equal terms; rather, most of the Alliance clubs were put in the new Football League Second Division, whose best teams would move up to the First Division in place of its worst teams. Another merger, with the top division of the Southern League in 1920, helped form the Third Division in similar fashion. Since then no new league has been formed of non-league clubs to try to achieve parity with The Football League (only to play at a lower level, like independent professional leagues in American baseball today).

For decades, teams finishing near the bottom of The Football League&#x27;s lowest division(s) faced re-election rather than automatic relegation. But the principle of promotion and relegation had been firmly established, and it eventually expanded to the football pyramid in place today. Meanwhile, The FA has remained English football&#x27;s overall governing body, retaining amateur and professional clubs rather than breaking up.

== Use in other competitions ==
Promotion and relegation has been used in several eSports leagues. Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s video game &quot;StarCraft II&quot; has a &quot;ladder&quot; that uses a promotion and relegation system, where individual players and pre-made teams can be promoted and relegated during the first few weeks of a league season, which generally lasts around 11 weeks, with promotion and relegation taking place based on a skill rating, which is in turn based on wins and losses. However, this form of matchmaking is not typically used for StarCraft II e-sports tournaments, which have various kinds of structures depending on the organizer, the most important being the ESL Pro Tour . Most professional &quot;League of Legends&quot; leagues like the League of Legends Championship Series and League of Legends Champions Korea used a promotion and relegation system, although the LCS moved away from this in 2018 for North America LCS and 2019 for the European LCS (which was renamed to the League of Legends European Championship), while the LCK moved away from the system in 2020. As of 2023, the Pacific Championship Series and Liga Latinoamérica are the only top-tier professional League of Legends leagues to have promotion and relegation; North America&#x27;s second-tier league, the North American Challengers League, also has promotion and relegation, as do the various regional leagues in Europe, but not with the top divisions.

The &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; Majors used a similar system where in the top eight finishers of one of the bi-annual Majors are designated with the &quot;Legends&quot; seed and automatically qualified for the next Major tournament. The best six eliminated teams in the second stage (known as &quot;New Legends Stage&quot;) of the Major would play a &quot;qualifying&quot; stage (known as &quot;New Challengers Stage&quot;) with another ten teams from the Minors qualifying tournaments in order to compete at the &quot;New Legends Stage&quot;. Starting in 2020, however, this was changed to a Regional Major Ranking system, at first a points-based system which was used for ESL One Rio 2020 and PGL Stockholm 2021 (The top rankings from the ESL One Rio 2020 RMRs were turned into PGL Stockholm 2021 points once IEM Rio was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and then a series of offline qualifiers starting with PGL Antwerp 2022, in which the teams from the &quot;Legends Stage&quot; (Now known as the &quot;Elimination Stage&quot;) from the previous Major automatically qualify for their RMRs and are joined by online qualifiers.

From 1993 until 2003, the Eurovision Song Contest used various systems of relegation to reconcile the number of countries wishing to participate (approximately 30 at the time) with the number of performances allowed considering time constraints of a live television program. The addition of a semi-final in 2004 allowed for more than 26 songs, but in 2008 automatic qualification of the previous year&#x27;s top 10 to the final was removed.

In Brazilian carnival&#x27;s samba school contest, a similar system is adopted, with the schools from lower divisions, or &quot;groups&quot;, able to be promoted into the highest tier, being currently called the &quot;Special Group&quot; (&quot;Grupo Especial&quot;). Schools parade in order of groups and ranking from last year contest, with the better ranked inside a group and the higher-tier groups having the privilege of going latter (this means the team has the opportunity of fixing issues with costumes and allegorical floats as well as more rehearsal time). The number of promoted and relegated schools, four until 1997, has been diminishing as time passes, becoming two from 1998 to 2007 and being only one nowadays. There has never been an official reason for that, but it is a fact that the relegated schools have more to lose nowadays, such as access to the Cidade do Samba (&quot;Samba City&quot;) facilities. There have been reported several interferences on the contest&#x27;s final result, especially when traditional schools are involved.

== Argentinian football and the average performance system ==
From 1957 to 1966 and from 1983 to the present, the Argentine First Division has used a system called &quot;Promedios&quot; based on the average performance over a number of seasons. Originally the previous two seasons, and later three or four seasons, clubs avoid relegation by having a high coefficient, which is obtained by dividing the points achieved in the last three seasons by the number of matches played in the same period. Teams with the lowest points coefficient at the end of the season are relegated to the Primera B Nacional.

This system has both positive and negative aspects, since all of the matches played for the championship in the last seasons are included in the coefficient for the clubs. Teams have an incentive to score points in every match of the season, meaning teams that are not challenging for the title or fighting relegation in the current season want to win even in the final matches to reduce the risk of relegation in the next season; examples are Club Atlético Banfield being champion of the Torneo Apertura in 2009 and last place in the next championship, the Torneo Clausura 2010, without being relegated until the end of the Torneo Apertura 2010 with a second-to-last place finish.

Similarly, River Plate finished last in the Torneo Apertura 2008 and after two bad campaigns and a mediocre one was relegated in the Torneo Clausura 2011 despite being in fifth place and qualifying for the 2011 Copa Sudamericana. This system forces the newly promoted teams to fight relegation from the very beginning of the season. It also allows teams with a low budget with previous good campaigns to compete in international competitions without having to prioritize the championship to avoid relegation; examples of this are Club Atlético Lanús, winner of the 2013 Copa Sudamericana, or Club Atlético Talleres, winner of the 1999 Conmebol Cup. The Uruguayan First Division adopted the same system in 2016. Paraguayan Primera División and Colombian Categoría Primera A also use this same system.

Also, a similar system was used only in the 1999 edition of .

<text>Operation Tempest or Operation Burza (, sometimes referred to in English as &quot;Operation Storm&quot;) was a series of uprisings conducted during World War II against occupying German forces by the Polish Home Army (&quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;, abbreviated &quot;AK&quot;), the dominant force in the Polish resistance.

Operation Tempest&#x27;s objective was to seize control of German-occupied cities and areas while the Germans were preparing their defenses against the advancing Soviet Red Army. The Polish Underground State hoped to take power before the Soviets arrived.

A goal of the Polish government-in-exile in London was to restore Poland&#x27;s 1939 borders with the USSR, rejecting the Curzon Line border. According to Jan Ciechanowski,&quot;The [exiled] Polish Cabinet believed that by refusing to accept the Curzon Line they were defending their country&#x27;s right to exist as a national entity. They were determined that Russo-Polish relations should be restored on the basis of the pre-1939 territorial arrangements.&quot;

==History==
From its inception, the Home Army had been preparing a national armed uprising against the Germans. The basic framework of the future uprising was created in September 1942. According to the plan, the Uprising was to be ordered by the Polish Commander-in-Chief in exile when the defeat of the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front became apparent. The Uprising was to begin in Central Poland: in the General Government, Dąbrowa Basin, Kraków Voivodeship, and the Białystok and Brześć areas.

The Uprising&#x27;s basic objectives were to:
# end the German occupation;
# seize arms and supplies needed for a Polish regular army on Polish soil;
# counter the threat from the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (see Massacres of Poles in Volhynia);
# rebuild a regular Polish Army;
# rebuild civil authority, communications, and an arms industry;
# maintain peace and order behind the front lines; and
# begin offensive operations against Wehrmacht forces still on Polish soil.
Reconstruction of a Polish regular army was to be based on the prewar Polish order of battle. Home Army units were to be turned into regular divisions. Initially to be created were 16 infantry divisions, three cavalry brigades and one motorized brigade, to be equipped with captured weapons or with arms and supplies delivered by the Allies. The second phase was to see the re-building of an additional 15 divisions and 5 cavalry brigades which, before World War II, had been stationed in eastern and western Poland.

The plan was partly implemented. Beginning in 1943, Home Army units were grouped into larger units bearing the names and numbers of prewar Polish divisions, brigades and regiments.

===&quot;Allies of our allies&quot;===
In early 1943, after the German defeat at Stalingrad, it became clear that the Soviets would be the force the Home Army would most likely have to deal with, and that the planned Polish uprising would face a still-powerful German army, rather than units retreating to an already defeated homeland.

In February 1943, the Home Army chief, General Stefan Rowecki, amended the plan. The Uprising would take place in three stages. The first stage would be an armed uprising in the east (with main centers of resistance at Lwów and Vilnius) in advance of the approaching Red Army. In preparation, the &quot;Wachlarz&quot; organization was formed. The second stage would be an armed struggle in the zone between the Curzon Line and the Vistula River; and the third stage would be a national uprising throughout the rest of Poland.

On April 25, 1943, Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations were broken off by Joseph Stalin due to Polish inquiries about the Katyn massacres, and it became clear that the advancing Red Army might not come to Poland as a liberator but rather, as General Rowecki put it, &quot;our allies&#x27; ally.&quot; On November 26, 1943, the Polish government-in-exile issued instructions that, if diplomatic relations did not resume with the Soviet Union before the Soviets entered Poland, Home Army forces were to remain underground pending further decisions.

The Home Army&#x27;s commander on the ground, however, took a different approach, and on November 30, 1943, a final version of the plan was drafted.

===Overview of the operation===

The plan was to cooperate with the advancing Red Army on a tactical level, while Polish civil authorities came out from underground and took power in Allied-controlled Polish territory. This plan was approved by the Delegate of the government-in-exile and by the Polish underground parliament, the Home Political Representation.

On January 2, 1944, Red Army forces of the 2nd Belorussian Front crossed the prewar Polish border and Operation Tempest began. The Division managed to contact the commanders of the advancing Red Army and began successful joint operations against the Wehrmacht. Together they retook Kowel (April 6) and Włodzimierz. However, the Division was soon forced to retreat west, and in Polesia was attacked by both German and Soviet forces. Polish soldiers taken prisoner by the Soviets were given the choice of joining the Red Army or being sent to Soviet forced-labor camps. The remnants of the Division crossed the Bug River, where they were attacked by Soviet partisan units. After liberating the towns of Lubartów and Kock, the Division (reduced to some 3,200 men) was surrounded by the Red Army and taken prisoner.

== In different regions of Poland ==
=== Southeast Volhynia ===
Operation Tempest began in Volhynia, a region which until 1939 had belonged to the Second Polish Republic (see Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)), in January 1944, after the Red Army had entered prewar Polish territory east of the town of Sarny on January 4. The operation, which was mainly carried out by the 27th Home Army Infantry Division (Poland) (some 6500 soldiers) was aimed at the Wehrmacht units, still operating in the region.

* January 4, 1944: the Red Army enters Volhynia east of Sarny
* January 15: a mobilization of ethnic Poles takes place in the area of Kowel and Włodzimierz Wołyński
* January 28: the 27th Volhynian Home Army Infantry Division is officially created
* February 10: Colonel Jan Wojciech Kiwerski is named commandant of the Volhynian District of the Home Army
* March 4: first Home Army unit meets the advancing Red Army
* March 17: a Wehrmacht company is disarmed at the village of Zasmyki near Kowel
* March 18: first skirmishes against Germans take place
* March 20–27: heavy battles in the Turia river valley
* March 23: a German detachment is disarmed at Stezarzyce
* March 24: a skirmish near Kapitulka
* March 26: Colonel Kiwerski meets Soviet General Sergeev
* April 1944: heavy fighting with the Wehrmacht west of Kowel. Due to German superiority, on April 12 Polish forces try to get in touch with the Red Army, after a failed attempt to capture Włodzimierz Wołyński. Eventually, the division is surrounded, and on April 18, its commandant, Colonel Kiwerski, was killed in action. On April 21 the unit escapes the encirclement, and after several skirmishes, on June 10 it crosses the Bug River, entering Lesser Poland. The division then took part in Operation Tempest in the region of Lublin, remaining active until late July 1944.

All together, between January and June 1944, the 27th Volhynian ID of the Home Army took part in over 100 skirmishes, losing over 600 soldiers. German and Hungarian losses are estimated at up to 750 KIA and 900 wounded.

===Northeast Operation Ostra Brama===

In the north, on July 7, 1944, the forces of the and (some 13,000 men under Colonel Aleksander Krzyżanowski) launched an attack on German-occupied Vilnius, although the attack stalled until the arrival of Soviet forces. The AK and Soviet armies then jointly occupied the city on July 13. Prior to the assault, the surrounding countryside had also been seized by Polish and Soviet partisans. Cooperation ended almost immediately after Vilnius was occupied; on July 14, Krzyżanowski and his officers were disarmed and imprisoned, and AK units who resisted disarmament were violently crushed by Soviet forces, with dozens of Polish fatalities.

===Lwów Uprising===

On July 23, Home Army forces in Lwów (now Lviv) began an armed rising in cooperation with advancing Soviet forces. In four days the city was taken over. The Polish civil and military authorities were then summoned to &quot;a meeting with Red Army commanders&quot; and taken prisoner by the Soviet NKVD. Colonel Władysław Filipkowski&#x27;s men were forcibly conscripted into the Red Army, sent to forced-labor camps, or went back underground.

=== Polesie ===
Operation Tempest in Polesia took place in the final days of the German occupation of this region. Due to rapid Soviet advance westwards (see Operation Bagration), it lasted for two weeks (July 15–30, 1944), mainly in the western part of Polesie, near Brześć nad Bugiem, Kobryn and Bereza Kartuska, but also in the area of Pinsk. The Home Army headquarters gave orders for the 30th Home Army Infantry Division to be created in Polesia. This unit was tasked with capturing the areas north and east of Brześć. The division concentrated in forested areas along the Nurzec river, with some 1000 soldiers.

On July 17, a Wehrmacht motorized transport was attacked near the folwark of Adampol, and a skirmish with the Germans took place near the village of Wyzary. On July 30, 1944, Polish forces made contact with Red Army&#x27;s 65th Army: Soviet officers ordered the Poles to merge with First Polish Army. Poles disobeyed this order, and headed towards Biała Podlaska, where they decided to march to Warsaw and fight in the Warsaw Uprising. Near Otwock, the division was surrounded and disarmed by the Soviets.

===Warsaw Uprising===
Seeing the fate of the Home Army forces that had taken part in Operation Tempest, the Polish government in exile and the Home Army&#x27;s current commander, General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, decided that the last chance for regaining Poland&#x27;s independence was to open an uprising in Warsaw. On July 21, 1944, Bór-Komorowski ordered that the Warsaw Uprising begin at 17:00 hours on August 1, 1944. The political goal was to emphasize for the Allies the existence of the Polish government and Polish civil authorities. Warsaw was to be taken in order to allow the legitimate Polish government to return from exile to Poland.

At the same time, other Home Army districts were also mobilized. Units of the Kraków area were preparing an uprising, similar to the one in Wilno, Lwów and Warsaw, but it was cancelled due to several reasons (see: Kraków Uprising (1944)). In the Kielce and Radom area, the 2nd Polish Home Army Division was formed and took control of the entire area except for the cities. Other units were also mustered in Kraków, Łódź and Greater Poland.

=== Białystok ===
Operation Tempest in Białystok and its area began in the second half of July 1944 and lasted until late September. The Home Army recreated here four units, based on interbellum Polish Army: 18th and 29th Infantry Divisions, also Suwałki Cavalry Brigade and Podlaska Cavalry Brigade. All together, some 7,000 soldiers fought in over 200 battles and skirmishes. The operation was commanded by Colonel [[Władysław Liniarski].

The first unit to enter the fighting was 81st Home Army Infantry Regiment, which operated in the forests around [[Grodno]]. Armed with light weapons, the regiment was too weak to capture the city of Grodno and limited its activities to fighting German outposts and police stations.

In the outskirts of Białystok, among Polish forces concentrated in the [[Knyszyn]] Wilderness were: 42nd Home Army Infantry Regiment, and 10th Home Army [[Uhlan]] Regiment. The 2nd Home Army [[Uhlan]] Regiment operated in the area of [[Bransk]] and [[Hajnówka]]. This unit destroyed the rail line between Hajnówka and [[Czeremcha, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Czeremcha]], including a rail bridge, which was blown up. The 76th Home Army Infantry Regiment fought in the area of [[Ciechanowiec]] and [[Lapy]].

Three Home Army regiments were formed in the [[Augustów Primeval Forest]]: 1st Home Army Uhlan Regiment (with 300 soldiers), 41st Home Army Infantry Regiment and 3rd Regiment (all together: 700 soldiers).

Fearing a partisan attack, the Germans declared a state of emergency in the town of [[Augustów]]. During Operation Tempest in this part of Białystok Province, over 30 raids of different kinds took place, in which 4 military transports were blown up, along the rail line from Augustow to Grodno. Home Army forces cooperated with the [[Red Army]]. On August 6, a unit of 300 soldiers managed to get through German lines, and into the areas controlled by the Soviets. By autumn 1944, most regiments had ceased operations. The last skirmish in this area took place on November 2 near the village of Nowinka.

In the forests surrounding the [[Osowiec Fortress]], 9th Home Army Mounted Rifles were concentrated under Wiktor Konopka. In July and August 1944, this regiment fought the Germans in several locations. On September 8, after a heavy battle, the unit was destroyed by the enemy. Survivors managed to cross the frontline, which at that time was along the [[Biebrza]] river.

In the area of [[Łomża]], the 33rd Home Army Infantry Regiment was created, with three battalions. It fought rear German units, breaking communication links between frontline and [[East Prussia]]. Near the village of [[Czarnowo-Undy]], some 150 Soviet prisoners of war were released by the Poles. As a reprisal, the Germans burned the village, shooting all its residents (July 22, 1944). On August 20, the 5th Home Army Uhlan Regiment, which operated in the area of [[Ostrołęka]], attacked a German artillery battery near the village of Labedy.

=== Lublin ===
Operation Tempest in the area of [[Lublin]] took place in the final two weeks of July 1944. The Home Army created there such units, as 3rd Infantry Division, 9th Infantry Division, 15th Infantry Regiment, also units of [[Bataliony Chłopskie]] and other resistance organizations, plus [[27th Home Army Infantry Division (Poland)]] from the province of [[Volhynia]]. All together, Polish forces in the region had some 20,000 men.

The partisans attacked retreating German forces along railways and roads in the whole district of Lublin. In several cases, they defended villages pacified by the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[SS]]. Poles cooperated with [[Red Army]] guerillas, which also operated in the area.

In the south (the region of [[Zamość]]), 9th Infantry Regiment under Major Stanislaw Prus liberated the town of [[Bełżec, Lublin Voivodeship|Bełżec]] (July 21). Together with the Soviets, they captured [[Tomaszów Lubelski]]. German forces were attacked in several locations, including [[Frampol]] and [[Zwierzyniec]].

On July 21 and 22, Volhynian 27th Division captured [[Kock]], [[Lubartów]] and [[Firlej]]. In western part of the province, 8th and 15th Infantry Regiments liberated a number of towns: [[Kurów]], [[Urzędów]], [[Nałęczów]], [[Garbów]], [[Wąwolnica, Lublin Voivodeship|Wąwolnica]], [[Sobolew, Lublin Voivodeship|Sobolew]], [[Ryki]], [[Końskowola]]. On July 26, Polish units cooperated with Soviet forces fighting for [[Puławy]]. Several German rail transports were destroyed, and Polish soldiers saved Końskowola from Germans, who planned to set the town on fire.

=== Kraków ===
Home Army District of [[Kraków]] was one of the largest districts of the organization. It spread from [[Przemyśl]] to Kraków itself, and the first fighting in the area took place in the east. In [[Rzeszow]] and Przemysl, 22nd and 24th Home Army Divisions were mobilized. In Rzeszów, [[Mielec]] and [[Krosno]], 10th Home Army Cavalry Brigade was created. In the west, 6th and 106th Home Army Infantry Divisions were created, also Kraków Brigade of Motorized Cavalry. Other units active in the region were: Independent Battalion of Major Jan Panczakiewicz and Operational Group Kraków under Colonel Edward Godlewski.

The Home Army considered an armed insurrection in the city of Kraków, but this plan was abandoned (see [[Kraków Uprising (1944)]]).

=== Radom–Kielce ===
Operation Tempest in [[Radom]] and [[Kielce]] began on August 1, 1944, and lasted until October 6. The Home Army here created 2nd, 7th and 28th Infantry Divisions, with several other units. The purpose of the operation was to aid the Red Army with its capture of the eastern bank of the [[Vistula]] and cities of the region. Polish partisans planned to defend the Vistula bridges, and armament factories in [[Starachowice]] and [[Skarżysko-Kamienna]].

After the Red Army had managed to cross the Vistula and capture bridgeheads at [[Sandomierz]] and [[Magnuszew]] (see [[Lublin–Brest Offensive]]), Home Army got in touch with the Soviets, and began cooperating with them.

In [[Kozienice]] and Sandomierz, Polish units supported the advancing Soviets: on the night of July 31 / August 1, 1944, a German counterattack was halted by the Polish 2nd Infantry Regiment of Captain Michal Mandziara, which helped the Soviets keep their positions in the Sandomierz Bridgehead. On August 3, Polish and Soviet forces liberated [[Staszów]]; in the following days, Poles, helped by Soviet tanks, captured [[Stopnica]] and [[Busko]].

On August 14, 1944, General [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] ordered all units of the Kielce – Radom area to march towards Warsaw and join the Warsaw Uprising. Operation Revenge, as it was called, resulted in the creation of Kielce Corps of the Home Army, under Colonel Jan Zientarski, with 6,430 soldiers. On August 21, during its concentration, the Corps saved residents of the village of Antoniów, which was raided by Germans.

Even though Kielce Corps began its march towards Warsaw, it did not reach the Polish capital. After careful analysis of German forces concentrated around Warsaw, Home Army leaders decided to halt the operation, as it was too risky. Poles did not have heavy weapons and tanks to face the enemy on equal terms. Operation Revenge was abandoned, and the Corps was dissolved.

In early September 1944, local units of the Home Army planned to capture either Kielce or Radom, also there were plans to seize [[Częstochowa]] and Skarzysko. 7th Infantry Division was transferred westwards, to the area of Częstochowa. 2nd Infantry remained near Kielce, actively fighting the enemy until November. In late October 1944, Operation Tempest was cancelled. All units were dissolved.

=== Łódź ===
Operation Tempest in the area of the city of [[Łódź]] took place in summer and autumn of 1944, lasting from August 14 until November 26. Local Home Army mobilized here several units, such as the 25th Infantry Regiment under Major Rudolf Majewski. This regiment was stationed in forests near [[Przysucha]]: in August 1944, it carried out a number of attacks on German forces, destroying rail lines. The last battle of the 25th regiment took place on November 8, all together it lost 130 men.

Among other units was 29th Kaniow Rifles Regiment, which operated near [[Brzeziny]]. On September 14, it captured a German warehouse at the station of [[Słotwiny, Łódź Voivodeship|Słotwiny]] near [[Koluszki]].

== Outcome ==

The Germans&#x27; suppression of the Warsaw Uprising, in the absence of Soviet assistance to the insurgents, marked the end of Operation Tempest. In military terms it was a success, in political terms a defeat. The Red Army, with the NKVD following the Polish forces, soon showed its real colours. Almost half of the Polish soldiers who took part in Operation Tempest were arrested. They were forcibly conscripted into Berling&#x27;s army, deported deep into Russia, or simply murdered.

<text>Sphecius speciosus, the eastern cicada-killer wasp, is a large, solitary digger wasp species in the family Bembicidae. They are so named because they hunt cicadas and provision their nests with them. Cicada killers exert a measure of natural control on cicada populations, and as such, they may directly benefit the deciduous trees upon which the cicadas feed. Sometimes, they are erroneously called sand hornets, despite not truly being hornets, which belong to the family Vespidae.

The most recent review of this species&#x27; biology is found in the posthumously published comprehensive study by noted entomologist Howard Ensign Evans.

== Distribution ==
This species can be found in the Eastern and Midwest U.S. and southwards into Mexico and Central America.

== Description ==

Adult eastern cicada wasps are large, long, robust wasps with hairy, reddish, and black areas on their thoraces (middle parts), and black to reddish brown abdominal (rear) segments that are marked with light yellow stripes. The wings are brownish. Coloration superficially resembles that of some yellowjacket and hornet species. The females are somewhat larger than the males, and both are among the largest wasps seen in the Eastern United States, their unusual size giving them a uniquely fearsome appearance. European hornets (&quot;Vespa crabro&quot;) are often mistaken for eastern cicada killers, though at about long, they are smaller than the largest cicada killers. The males are smaller than the females because they are not given as much larval food; since females must carry the cicadas they have killed to a burrow for nesting, they benefit from being larger, and are given more food as larvae.

==Life cycle and habits==
Solitary wasps like the eastern cicada killer are very different in their behavior from the social wasps such as hornets, yellowjackets, or paper wasps. Cicada killer females use their stings to paralyze their prey (cicadas) rather than to defend their nests; unlike most social wasps and bees, they do not attempt to sting unless handled roughly. Adults feed on flower nectar and other plant sap exudates.

Adults emerge in summer, typically beginning around late June or early July and die off in September or October. They are present in a given area for 60 to 75 days, usually until mid-September. Males emerge first to compete for females. The large females are commonly seen skimming around lawns seeking good sites to dig burrows and searching for cicadas in trees and taller shrubs.
The males are more often seen in groups, vigorously challenging one another for position on the breeding aggregation from which they emerged, and generally investigate anything that moves or flies near them. Not unusually, two or three male wasps are seen locked together in apparent midair combat, the aggregate adopting an erratic flight path until one of the wasps breaks away. The male wasps&#x27; aggressive behavior is similar to that of another robust insect of the area, the male carpenter bee. In both cases, while the males&#x27; vigorous territorial defense can be frightening and intimidating to human passersby, the males pose no danger whatsoever. Male cicada killers only grapple with other insects, and cannot sting.
This ground-burrowing wasp may be found in well-drained, sandy to loose clay soils in bare or grass-covered banks, berms, and hills, as well as next to raised sidewalks, driveways and patio slabs. Females may share a burrow, digging their own nest cells off the main tunnel. A typical burrow is deep and about wide. In digging a burrow, the female dislodges the soil with her jaws, and using her hind legs, pushes loose soil behind her as she backs out of the burrow. Her hind legs are equipped with special spines that help her push the soil behind her. The excess soil pushed out of the burrow forms a mound with a trench through it at the burrow entrance. Cicada killers may nest in planters, window boxes, or flower beds, or under shrubs, ground cover, etc. Nests often are made in the full sun where vegetation is sparse.

After digging a nest chamber in the burrow, female cicada killers capture cicadas, paralyzing them with a sting. After paralyzing a cicada, the female wasp holds it upside down beneath her and takes off toward her burrow; this return flight to the burrow is difficult for the wasp because the cicada is often more than twice her weight. A wasp often lugs her prey up into the nearest tree, to gain altitude for the flight to the burrow. After putting one or more cicadas in her nest cell, the female deposits an egg on a cicada and closes the cell with soil. Male eggs are laid on a single cicada, but female eggs are given two or sometimes three cicadas, because the female wasp is twice as large as the male and must have more food. New nest cells are dug as necessary off the main burrow tunnel, and a single burrow may eventually have 10 or more nest cells. The egg hatches in one or two days, and the cicadas serve as food for the grub. The larvae complete their development in about 2 weeks. Overwintering occurs as a mature larva within an earth-coated cocoon. Pupation occurs in the nest cell in the spring and lasts 25 to 30 days. Only one generation occurs per year, and no adults overwinter.
This wasp is frequently attacked by the parasitic &quot;velvet ant&quot; wasp, &quot;Dasymutilla occidentalis&quot;, also known as the &quot;cow-killer&quot; wasp. It lays an egg in the nest cell of the cicada killer, and when the cicada killer larva pupates, the parasitoid larva consumes the pupa.

== Interaction with humans ==

Although cicada killers are large, females are not aggressive and rarely sting unless they are grasped roughly, stepped upon with bare feet, or caught in clothing. One author who has been stung indicates that for him, the stings are not much more than a &quot;pinprick&quot;. Males aggressively defend their perching areas on nesting sites against rival males, but they have no stinger. Although they appear to attack anything that moves near their territories, male cicada killers are actually investigating anything that might be a female cicada killer ready to mate. Such close inspection appears to many people to be an attack, but male and female cicada killers do not land on people with the intent to sting. If handled roughly, females will sting, and males will jab with a sharp spine on the tip of their abdomen. They are generally not aggressive towards humans and usually fly away when swatted at, rather than attacking.

== Other cicada-killer wasps ==

The North American cicada-killer wasps all belong to the genus &quot;Sphecius&quot;, which has 21 species worldwide. The remaining three cicada-killing species in the genus in North America are:
* &quot;Sphecius convallis&quot;, the Pacific cicada killer, occurs in the western U.S. and in Mexico.
* &quot;Sphecius grandis&quot;, the western cicada killer, occurs in the mid- and western U.S. and in Mexico.
* &quot;Sphecius hogardii&quot;, the Caribbean cicada killer, occurs in the U.S. in Florida and in the Caribbean.

The western cicada killer is thought to represent more than one species. Also, some evidence suggests that the eastern cicada killer has either a subspecies or a closely related species that mimics the Pacific cicada killer. Alternatively, when they were already distinct species, significant hybridization occurred between them, though not enough to fully overcome their present reproductive isolation.

&quot;Sphecius spectabilis&quot; , is found in the South American countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, French Guiana, Paraguay, Surinam, and Venezuela.

Sixteen other cicada-killer wasp species in the genus &quot;Sphecius&quot; are found in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Other genera of cicada-killing wasps (e.g., &quot;Liogorytes&quot; in South America and &quot;Exeirus&quot; in Australia) are the &quot;cicada killers&quot; of their native lands.

<text>In differential geometry, a &quot;G&quot;2 manifold or Joyce manifold is a seven-dimensional Riemannian manifold with holonomy group contained in &quot;G&quot;2. The group formula_1 is one of the five exceptional simple Lie groups. It can be described as the automorphism group of the octonions, or equivalently, as a proper subgroup of special orthogonal group SO(7) that preserves a spinor in the eight-dimensional spinor representation or lastly as the subgroup of the general linear group GL(7) which preserves the non-degenerate 3-form formula_2, the associative form. The Hodge dual, formula_3 is then a parallel 4-form, the coassociative form. These forms are calibrations in the sense of Reese Harvey and H. Blaine Lawson, and thus define special classes of 3- and 4-dimensional submanifolds.

== Properties ==
All formula_1-manifold are 7-dimensional, Ricci-flat, orientable spin manifolds. In addition, any compact manifold with holonomy equal to formula_1 has finite fundamental group, non-zero first Pontryagin class, and non-zero third and fourth Betti numbers.

== History ==
The fact that formula_1 might possibly be the holonomy group of certain Riemannian 7-manifolds was first suggested by the 1955 classification theorem of Marcel Berger, and this remained consistent with the simplified proof later given by Jim Simons in 1962. Although not a single example of such a manifold had yet been discovered, Edmond Bonan nonetheless made a useful contribution by showing that, 
if such a manifold did in fact exist, it would carry both a parallel 3-form and a parallel 4-form, and that it would necessarily be Ricci-flat.

The first local examples of 7-manifolds with holonomy formula_1 were finally constructed around 1984 by Robert Bryant, and his full proof of their existence appeared in the Annals in 1987. Next, complete (but still noncompact) 7-manifolds with holonomy formula_1 were constructed by Bryant and Simon Salamon in 1989. The first compact 7-manifolds with holonomy formula_1 were constructed by Dominic Joyce in 1994. Compact formula_1 manifolds are therefore sometimes known as &quot;Joyce manifolds&quot;, especially in the physics literature. In 2013, it was shown by M. Firat Arikan, Hyunjoo Cho, and Sema Salur that any manifold with a spin structure, and, hence, a formula_1-structure, admits a compatible almost contact metric structure, and an explicit compatible almost contact structure was constructed for manifolds with formula_1-structure. In the same paper, it was shown that certain classes of formula_1-manifolds admit a contact structure.

In 2015, a new construction of compact formula_1 manifolds, due to Alessio Corti, Mark Haskins, Johannes Nordstrőm, and Tommaso Pacini, combined a gluing idea suggested by Simon Donaldson with new algebro-geometric and analytic techniques for constructing Calabi–Yau manifolds with cylindrical ends, resulting in tens of thousands of diffeomorphism types of new examples.

== Connections to physics ==
These manifolds are important in string theory. They break the original supersymmetry to 1/8 of the original amount. For example, M-theory compactified on a formula_1 manifold leads to a realistic four-dimensional (11-7=4) theory with N=1 supersymmetry. The resulting low energy effective supergravity contains a single supergravity supermultiplet, a number of chiral supermultiplets equal to the third Betti number of the formula_1 manifold and a number of U(1) vector supermultiplets equal to the second Betti number. Recently it was shown that almost contact structures (constructed by Sema Salur et al.) play an important role in formula_1 geometry&quot;.

<doc id="648066" wikidata="Q1598759" url="?curid=648066" title="Light infantry">
<text>Light infantry refers to certain types of lightly equipped infantry throughout history. They have a more mobile or fluid function than other types of infantry, such as heavy infantry or line infantry. Historically, light infantry often fought as scouts, raiders, and skirmishers. These are loose formations that fight ahead of the main army to harass, delay, disrupt supply lines, engage the enemy&#x27;s own skirmishing forces, and generally &quot;soften up&quot; an enemy before the main battle. Light infantrymen were also often responsible for screening the main body of a military formation.

Post-World War II, the term &quot;light infantry&quot; evolved to include rapid-deployment units (including commando and airborne units) that emphasized speed and mobility over armor and firepower. Some units or battalions that historically held a skirmishing role have kept their designation &quot;light infantry&quot; for the sake of tradition.

==History==

===Ancient history===

The concept of a skirmishing screen is a very old one and was already well-established in Ancient Greece and Roman times in the form, for example, of the Greek peltast and psiloi, and the Roman &quot;velites&quot;. As with the so-called &quot;light infantry&quot; of later periods, the term more adequately describes the role of such infantry rather than the actual weight of their equipment. Peltast equipment, for example, grew steadily heavier at the same time as hoplite equipment grew lighter. It was the fact that peltasts fought in open order as skirmishers that made them light infantry and that hoplites fought in the battle line in a phalanx formation that made them heavy infantry.

===Modern history===
Early regular armies of the modern era frequently relied on irregulars to perform the duties of light infantry skirmishers. In particular, the French Army employed detachments of German and Balkan mercenaries to serve as patrols in the rough country until a permanent corps of Mountain Fusiliers (&quot;Fusiliers des Montagnes&quot;) was raised in the 1740s. In the 17th century, dragoons were sometimes employed as the skirmishers of their day, as mounted infantrymen who rode into battle but dismounted to fight, giving them a mobility lacking to regular foot soldiers.

In the 18th and 19th centuries most infantry regiments or battalions had a light company as an integral part of its composition. Its members were often smaller, more agile men with high shooting ability and capability of using initiative. They did not usually fight in disciplined ranks as did the ordinary infantry but often in widely dispersed groups, necessitating an understanding of skirmish warfare. They were expected to avoid melee engagements unless necessary and would fight ahead of the mainline to harass the enemy before falling back to the main position.

During the period 1777–1781, the Continental Army of the United States adopted the British Army practice of seasonally drafting light infantry regiments as temporary units during active field operations, by combining existing light infantry companies detached from their parent regiments.

Light infantry sometimes carried lighter muskets than ordinary infantrymen while others carried rifles and wore rifle green uniforms. These became designated as &quot;rifle regiments&quot; in Britain and &quot;Jäger&quot; and &quot;Schützen&quot; (sharpshooter) regiments in German-speaking Europe. In France, during the Napoleonic Wars, light infantry were called &quot;voltigeurs&quot; and &quot;chasseurs&quot; and the sharpshooters &quot;tirailleurs&quot;. The Austrian army had Grenzer regiments from the middle of the 18th century, who originally served as irregular militia skirmishers recruited from frontier areas. They were gradually absorbed into the line infantry becoming a hybrid type that proved successful against the French, to the extent that Napoleon recruited several units of Austrian army Grenzer to his own army after victory over Austria in 1809 compelled the Austrians to cede territories from which they were traditionally recruited. In Portugal, 1797, companies of &quot;Caçadores&quot; (Hunters) were created in the Portuguese Army, and in 1808 led to the formation of independent &quot;Caçador&quot; battalions that became known for their ability to perform precision shooting at long distances.

Light infantry officers sometimes carried muskets or rifles, rather than pistols, and their swords were light curved sabres; as opposed to the heavy, straighter swords of other infantry officers. Orders were sent by bugle or whistle instead of drums (since the sound of a bugle carries further and it is difficult to move fast when carrying a drum). Some armies, including the British and French, recruited whole regiments (or converted existing ones) of light infantry. These were considered elite units, since they required specialised training with emphasis on self-discipline, manoeuvre and initiative to carry out the roles of light infantry as well as those of ordinary infantry.

By the late 19th century, the concept of fighting in formation was on the wane due to advancements in weaponry and the distinctions between light and heavy infantry began to disappear. Essentially, all infantry became light infantry in operational practice. Some regiments retained the name and customs, but there was in effect little difference between them and other infantry regiments.

On the eve of World War I, the British Army included seven light infantry regiments. These differed from other infantry only in maintaining such traditional distinctions as badges that included a bugle-horn, dark green home service helmets for full dress, and a fast-stepping parade ground march.

===Contemporary===
Today the term &quot;light&quot; denotes, in the United States table of organization and equipment, units lacking heavy weapons and armor or with a reduced vehicle footprint. Light infantry units lack the greater firepower, operational mobility and protection of mechanized or armored units, but possess greater tactical mobility and the ability to execute missions in severely restrictive terrain and in areas where weather makes vehicular mobility difficult.

Light infantry forces typically rely on their ability to operate under restrictive conditions, surprise, violence of action, training, stealth, field craft, and fitness levels of the individual soldiers to compensate for their reduced lethality. Despite the usage of the term &quot;light&quot;, forces in a light unit will normally carry heavier individual loads vis-à-vis other forces; they must carry everything they require to fight, survive and win due to lack of vehicles. Although units like the 101st Airborne (Air Assault) and the 82nd Airborne Division are categorized as Air Assault Infantry and Airborne Infantry respectively, they fall under the overall concept of light infantry. They are typically infantry intended for difficult terrain such as mountains or arctic conditions (US Marines) (Royal Marines, United States Army 10th Mountain Division, United States Army 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Mountain), Italian Army Alpini, French Army 27ème bataillon de chasseurs alpins) or jungle (1st Scout Ranger Regiment, Brazilian Army Jungle Infantry Brigades).

In the 1980s, the United States Army increased light forces to address contingencies and increased threats requiring a more deployable force able to operate in restrictive environments for limited periods. At its height, this included the 6th Infantry Division (light), 7th Infantry Division (light), 10th Mountain Division (light infantry), 25th Infantry Division, and the 75th Ranger Regiment. Operation Just Cause is often cited as proof of concept. Almost 30,000 U.S. Forces, mostly light, deployed to Panama within a 48-hour period to execute combat operations. On 30 September 1985, the 29th Infantry Division (Maryland and Virginia Army National Guard) was reactivated at Fort Belvoir, Virginia as the only light Infantry Division in the US Army&#x27;s reserve components.

During the Falklands War in 1982, both Argentina and the United Kingdom made heavy use of light infantry and its doctrines during the campaign, most notably the Argentine 5th Naval Infantry Battalion (Argentina) and 25th Infantry Regiment (Argentina) and the British Parachute Regiment and Royal Marines of 3 Commando Brigade. Due to the rocky and mountainous terrain of the Falkland Islands, operations on the ground were only made possible with the use of light infantry because the use of mechanized infantry or armour was severely limited by of the terrain, leading to the &quot;Yomp&quot; across the Falklands, in which Royal Marines and Paras yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering 56 miles (90 km) in three days carrying 80-pound (36 kg) loads after disembarking from ships at San Carlos on East Falkland, on 21 May 1982.

During the 1990s, the concept of purely light forces in the US military came under scrutiny due to their decreased lethality and survivability. This scrutiny has resulted in the Stryker Brigade Combat Team, a greater focus on task organized units (such as Marine Expeditionary Units) and a reduction of purely light forces.

Despite their reduction, light forces have proven successful in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom), underlining the continued need for light infantry.

===Argentina===
*Mountain Huntsmen, in Spanish: &quot;Cazadores de Montaña&quot;
*Jungle Huntsmen, in Spanish: &quot;Cazadores de Monte&quot;

===Austria===
===Belgium===
* 12th-13th Battalion of the Line
* 1st Regiment Jagers te Paard, mechanized reconnaissance battalion
* 2nd/4th Regiment Mounted Rifles, mechanized reconnaissance battalion with electronic warfare unit

=== Brazil ===
There are three light infantry brigades, (4ª Brigada de Infantaria Leve de Montanha, 11ª Brigada de Infantaria Leve and 12ª Brigada de Infantaria Leve Aeromóvel), and an airborne infantry brigade (Brigada de Infantaria Paraquedista). The 12º Light Infantry Brigade and the Airborne Infantry Brigade both belong to the Força de Ação Rápida Estratégica (Quick Strategic Action Force), which is composed of units capable of rapidly engaging in combat anywhere in Brazil.

=== Canada ===
Each of the three regular army regiments (Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, Royal Canadian Regiment and Royal 22e Régiment) maintains their third battalion as light infantry capable in airborne, mountain, and amphibious operations, with varying degrees of capability. All reserve infantry units are classed as light infantry, all with varying degrees of capability.

===Denmark===
* Schleswig Regiment of Foot

===Finland===
*Finnish Jäger troops, volunteers from Finland in Germany trained as Jägers
*Guard Jaeger Regiment, a Finnish Army unit
*Jaeger Brigade, a unit of the Finnish Army
*Para Jägers, Special Operations Airborne Infantry in the Finnish Army
*Utti Jaeger Regiment, the Finnish Army training and development centre for special forces and helicopter operations
*Sissi troops can also be considered light infantry

Finnish infantry units are also known as Jäger (Finnish pl. &quot;Jääkärit&quot;, Swedish pl. &quot;Jägarna&quot;), a legacy of a Finnish volunteer Jäger battalion formed in Germany during World War I to fight for the liberation of Finland from Russia.

===France===

====Ancien régime====
The Chasseur designation was given to certain regiments of French light infantry (&quot;Chasseurs à pied&quot;) or light cavalry (&quot;Chasseurs à cheval&quot;).

The &quot;Chasseurs à pied&quot; (light infantry) were originally recruited from hunters or woodsmen. The &quot;Chasseurs à Pied&quot;, as the marksmen of the French army, were considered an elite. The first unit raised was Jean Chrétien Fischer&#x27;s Free Hunter Company in 1743. Early units were often a mix of cavalry and infantry. In 1776, all &quot;Chasseurs&quot; units were re-organized into six battalions, each linked to a cavalry regiment (&quot;Chasseurs à cheval&quot;). In 1788, the link between infantry battalions and cavalry regiments was broken.

====Revolution and Napoleon====
In 1793, the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;&#x27;s Chasseur battalions were merged with volunteer battalions in new units called Light Infantry half-brigades (&quot;demi-brigades d’infanterie légère&quot;). In 1803, the half-brigades were renamed regiments. These units had three battalions of three regular &quot;Chasseurs&quot; companies, one elite &quot;Carabiniers&quot; company and one reconnaissance &quot;voltigeurs&quot; company.

In Napoléon&#x27;s Imperial Guard, many units used names linked to light infantry:
* Chasseurs à pied: three regiments (1809–1815; 1815–1815; 1815–1815). The regiments were the elite of the light infantry regiments.
* Fusilier-Chasseurs: a single regiment, originally the first Guard Fusilier Regiment (1809–1815)
* Voltigeur: 16 regiments, originally two regiments of &quot;Tirailleurs-chasseur&quot; and two regiments of &quot;Conscrits-chasseurs&quot; (1810–1815), then twelve new regiments (1811–1815). These regiments were expected to become Chasseurs à pieds.
* Flanqueurs-Chasseurs: two regiments, from drafted Forest Service members (1811–1815; 1813–1815)

In Bourbon royalist
* Chasseurs Britanniques: battalion-sized corps of royalist volunteers.

====19th century====
The Napoleonic light infantry regiments existed until 1854, but there were very few differences between them and the line infantry regiments, so the 25 remaining light infantry regiments were transformed to line infantry in 1854.

* Chasseurs à pied: The Duke of Orléans, heir to the throne, created in 1838 a new light infantry unit, the &quot;Tirailleurs&quot; battalion. It soon became, under the name &quot;Chasseur à Pied&quot;, the main light infantry unit in the French Army. The number of battalions grew up steadily through the century. The current Chasseurs battalions drew their lineage form this unit.
* Chasseurs alpins: Some of Chasseurs à pied battalions were converted to specialized mountain units as &quot;Bataillons de Chasseurs Alpins&quot; in 1888, as an answer to the Italian Alpine (&quot;Alpini&quot;) regiments stationed along the Alpine frontier.
* Chasseurs Forestiers: The &quot;Chasseurs forestiers&quot; (Forest Huntsmen) were militarized units of the Forest Service. They were organized in companies. They existed between 1875 and 1924.
*Infanterie Légère d&#x27;Afrique (African Light Infantry) were penal battalions forming part of the French forces serving in North Africa. These units were recruited mainly from convicted military criminals from all branches of the French Army, who had finished their sentences in military prisons but still had time to serve before their engagement periods were finished.
* Zouaves: The &quot;Zouaves&quot; battalions and regiments were colonial troops, formed originally by Algerians, then by European settlers and colonists. The first Zouave battalion was created in 1831 and changed its recruiting to Europeans in 1841. During the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, effective use was made of Zouaves and &quot;Chasseurs à pied&quot; (see above) in evolving light infantry tactics that went further than merely screening the main battle line. At the Battle of Solferino these newly organized skirmishers operated as independent groups that were able to disrupt their Austrian opponents by sudden flank assaults.
* Tirailleurs: &quot;Tirailleurs&quot; (Skirmishers) were light infantry who formed a shallow line ahead of the line of battle during the Revolutionary/Napoleonic Wars and subsequently. The name was also used for the locally recruited colonial troops in the French Empire between 1841 and 1962.

====20th century====
* Chasseurs à pied: The &quot;Chasseurs à pieds&quot; evolved during the mid 20th century into mechanized infantry units (&quot;Chasseurs mécanisés&quot;) or armored division infantry (&quot;Chasseurs portés&quot;). After World War Two, all Chasseur units were organized on the mechanized infantry model.
* Chasseurs alpins: The &quot;Chasseurs alpins&quot;, mountain warfare units of the French Army created in 1888.
* Chasseurs pyrénéens and Chasseurs pyrénéens were the short-lived (1939–1940) mountain warfare units formed in the Pyrénées.
* Chasseurs-Parachutistes: The &quot;Chasseurs-parachutistes&quot; were airborne infantry units formed in 1943 from Air Force infantry compagnies transferred to the Army.
* Zouaves and Tirailleurs: After the independence of the countries that made up the French Colonial Empire, the &quot;Zouaves&quot; and the &quot;Tirailleurs&quot; units, save for one, were disbanded.

====Modern French Army Light Infantry====
* 7th Chasseurs Alpins Battalion
* 13th Chasseurs Alpins Battalion
* 16th Chasseur Battalion
* 27e bataillon de chasseurs alpins
* 1st Tirailleur Regiment
* 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment

Although the traditions of these different branches of the French Army are very different, there is still a tendency to confuse one with the other. For example, when World War I veteran Léon Weil died, the AFP press agency stated that he was a member of the 5th &quot;Regiment de Chasseurs Alpins&quot;. It was in fact the 5th Bataillon.

===Germany===
===Hungary===
===India===
The Indian Army of 1914 included ten regiments with &quot;Light Infantry&quot; in their titles. These were the:
*2nd Queen Victoria&#x27;s Own Rajput Light Infantry
*5th Light Infantry
*6th Jat Light Infantry
*63rd Palamcottah Light Infantry
*83rd Wallajahabad Light Infantry
*91st Punjabis (Light Infantry)
*103rd Mahratta Light Infantry
*105th Mahratta Light Infantry
*110th Mahratta Light Infantry
*127th Baluch Light Infantry
Most of these regiments lost their separate identity as a result of extensive amalgamations in 1922. The modern Indian Army retains the Maratha Light Infantry and the Sikh Light Infantry.

Of the 28 infantry regiments of the modern Indian Army, the following ten are designated as &quot;Rifles&quot;. They are distinguished by their black rank badges, black buttons on their service and ceremonial uniforms and a beret in a darker shade of green than other regiments. Two paramilitary forces—the Assam Rifles and the Eastern Frontier Rifles—also follow the traditions of a rifle regiment.

*Rajputana Rifles
*Garhwal Rifles
*1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)
*3 Gorkha Rifles
*4 Gorkha Rifles
*5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)
*8 Gorkha Rifles
*9 Gorkha Rifles
*11 Gorkha Rifles
*Jammu and Kashmir Rifles
*Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry
*Maratha Light Infantry
*Sikh Light Infantry

=== Ireland ===

The Irish famously employed &quot;Cethernacht&quot; or Kern as light infantry. These usually made up the bulk of Gaelic and even later Anglo Norman Irish armies during the Middle Ages to renaissance era&#x27;s. Traditionally armed with javelins and swords while wearing no armour, in later periods they were equipped with caliver muskets while still using little to no armour. They were notably effective while employed in tandem with heavily armed &quot;Galloglaich&quot; or anglicised Gallowglass. They could provide effective support to heavily armed troops as well as endlessly harassing enemies in difficult terrain.
Today, all infantry battalions of the Irish Army are light infantry soldiers.

===Italy===
Most of the states of the Italian peninsula had their own units of skirmishers before Italian unification. One of the few that survived it were the Sardinian &quot;Bersaglieri&quot;, who were formed in 1836. They became some of the most iconic soldiers in Italian Army and were its &quot;quick reaction force&quot;. The Alpini are the Italian Army&#x27;s elite mountain troops, founded in 1875. Although they may not seem a true &quot;light infantry&quot; unit, (they were assigned their own artillery, carried double load of everything, and had a slower marching pace of 45 steps per minute), the Alpini were trained as jagers and skirmishers, introducing the use of skis and climbing training for all of their recruits. Those two corps still exist today, but in recent years the Bersaglieri have become a mechanised infantry unit, working closely with armoured units, and up until the mid-1990s had their own tank and artillery units. Other units that can be classified as light infantry are:

* The &quot;Folgore&quot; Parachute Brigade, created in 1963, is the only airborne unit in the Italian Army. Apart from one light cavalry regiment, it comprises three airborne infantry and two special force regiments.
* The Friuli Air Assault Brigade was originally an Italian Army mechanised brigade. In 2000 it converted to a fully airmobile role and is part of the &quot;Friuli&quot; Division. It is composed of three light aviation regiments and one infantry regiment—66th Reggimento Fanteria Aeromobile &quot;Trieste&quot;—the only regiment in the Italian Army to be fully airmobile.
* The San Marco Marine Brigade of the Italian Navy comprises three regiments. The First is an amphibious assault unit, the Second carries out force protection, boarding and search and seizure procedures on ships and the Third is a training unit. Given that it has almost only light vehicles (the heaviest being the amphibious Arisgator and AAV7 landing vehicles) and is tasked to operate in harsh terrain (shore lines, lagoons, deserts, mountains, jungles), it is one of the purest &quot;light infantry&quot; units in the Italian Armed Forces.

=== Myanmar ===
The modern Myanmar Army is reported to have a total of 10 units designated as a &quot;Light Infantry Division&quot; and 20 units designated as &quot;Military Operation Command&quot;. Two units are mostly similar in term of organisational structure. One of the main differences is that LIDs are mostly numbered in double digits like 11, 22, 33, 44 whereas MOCs are numbered sequelly. Both commands 10 battalions. While not that obvious, one of the main difference in term of organisational structure is that LIDs&#x27; 10 battalions are all Light Infantry whereas for MOC, it&#x27;s 7 Infantry Battalions (Motorised) and 3 Infantry Battalions (Mechanised). Both have an intermediate layer between the Battalions and Division HQ called Tactical Operation Command. A TOC is a unit that commands up to 3 battalions. Essentially, LIDs are made up of 3 TOC and 1 battalion under HQ as reserve whereas MOCs are made up of 2 TOC (Motorised) and 1 TOC (Mechanised) with an IB (Motorised) under HQ as reserve. As for the command structure, LIDs are directly answerable to the Commander in Chief of Army whereas MOCs are subordinate to their respective Regional Military Command. As for unit patches, LIDs have their own division patches where MOCs do not have distinctive patches and wear RMC&#x27;s patch instead. LIDs in Burmese are called ခြေမြန်တပ်မဌာနချုပ် (တမခ) whereas MOCs are called စစ်ဆင်ရေးကွပ်ကဲမှုဌာနချုပ် (စကခ). Both Light Infantry Divisions and MOCs have an officer ranked Brigadier General as their General Officer Commanding, Colonel as Second in Command and Lieutenant Colonel as Division Chief of Staff (informally Division G/A/Q).

===Portugal===
Portuguese light infantry soldiers were known as &quot;caçadores&quot; (literally &quot;huntsmen&quot;). Initially organized as a light company in each of the line infantry regiments, the &quot;caçadores&quot; were later organized as independent battalions. They constituted the elite light infantry of the Portuguese Army during the Peninsular War, being considered by the Duke of Wellington as the &quot;fighting cocks of his army&quot;. They wore distinctive brown uniforms as an early form of camouflage.

The &quot;caçadores&quot; units were disbanded by the Army reorganization of 1911, but were recreated in 1926 as high readiness units, responsible for defending the border and other strategic points of the Country until the line units could be mobilized. In the 1950s, the designation &quot;caçadores&quot; started to be also given to the expeditionary provisional light infantry battalions and independent companies responsible for reinforcing the overseas territories garrisons. These units constituted the bulk of the Portuguese forces engaged in the several theatres of the Portuguese Overseas War, from 1961 to 1975. Colonial troops with this title also existed, being recruited among both Portuguese European settlers and from indigenous populations. In the 1950s, the Portuguese Air Force formed a unit of paratroopers called &quot;caçadores paraquedistas&quot; (&quot;parachutist hunters&quot;). Additional battalions of &quot;caçadores paraquedistas&quot; were later created in Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea. At the beginning of the 1960s, Portuguese Army raised special forces companies of that were named &quot;caçadores especiais&quot; (special huntsmen). The &quot;caçadores especiais&quot; wore a brown beret in the colour of the uniforms of the &quot;caçadores&quot; of the Peninsular War. These units were later abolished and the brown beret started to be used by most of the units of the Portuguese Army.

In 1975, the designation &quot;caçadores&quot; was discontinued in the Portuguese Armed Forces. All former units of &quot;caçadores&quot; were redesigned as &quot;infantry&quot;. Currently, every infantry soldier of the Portuguese Army is known as &quot;atirador&quot;. Today, the Portuguese Army uses the designation &quot;light infantry&quot; as a generic collective classification of the Paratroopers, Commandos and Special Operations troops, while the remaining infantry is classified as &quot;motorized/mechanized infantry&quot;.

===Rhodesia===
The Rhodesian Light Infantry was a regular regiment of the Rhodesian Army, unique in having the traditions of light infantry while serving as a modern Commando regiment.

===Romania===
*Vânători de Munte, or &quot;Mountain Huntsmen&quot; are the elite mountain units of the Romanian Army since their establishment in 1916
*Vânători, or &quot;Huntsmen&quot;, were the elite Romanian light infantry units until their disbanding in 1947

===Russia===
The Imperial Russian Army, which was heavily influenced by the Prussian and Austrian military systems, included fifty Jäger or &quot;yegerskii&quot; [егерский] regiments in its organisation by 1812, including the Egersky Guards Regiment. They were mostly united with line infantry regiments in 1833, when almost all Russian infantry began to receive the same training; including skirmishing. At the same time &quot;strelkovyi&quot; [стрелковый] battalions were introduced. These undertook light infantry functions when the skirmishing skills of line infantry were insufficient.

===Spain===
Historically the Spanish infantry included several battalions of light infantry that were designated as &quot;Cazadores&quot;. These units were incorporated into the ordinary infantry following army reorganization in the early 1930s. Until 2006 the modern Spanish Army maintained a Brigada de Cazadores de Montaña &quot;Aragón I&quot; (Mountain Huntsmen Brigade &quot;Aragón I&quot;)

===Sweden===
*Jägare, elite units in the Swedish Armed Forces
*Fallskärmsjägarna, the Parachute Rangers
*Swedish Parachute Ranger School
*Ö-Nerike skvadron, Intelligence squadron
*Vadsbo skvadron, Airborne squadron
*Army Ranger Battalion, Arctic warfare rifles
*Kustjägarna, Coastal Rangers
*Livbataljon, Life Guards Battalion

*Jämtlands fältjägarkår, Jamtland Field ranger corps

===Somalia===
*Danab, which translates to &quot;Lightning&quot; are the elite commandos units of the Somali Armed Forces.

=== United Kingdom ===


The British Army first experimented with light infantry in the French and Indian War, to counter the tactics used by the French-allied Native Americans. Along with secondment of regular infantry, several specialised units were raised (including Rogers&#x27; Rangers and the 80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot), though most if not all had been disbanded by the middle of the 1760s. From 1770, all regular battalions were required to designate one of their ten companies a &quot;Light Company&quot;, though their training in skirmishing was poor and inconsistent.

Dedicated rifle and light infantry regiments began to be formed or converted in the Napoleonic Wars, to counter the French &quot;Chasseurs&quot;. A new battalion of the 60th Royal Americans (later the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps) was raised in 1797, and an &quot;Experimental Corps of Riflemen&quot; (later the 95th Rifles and then the Rifle Brigade) in 1800. Both were equipped with green jackets and Baker rifles. Some extant regiments began to be designated &quot;Light Infantry&quot; at this point, receiving skirmishing training but generally still equipped with red coats and muskets. In the Peninsular War, a Light Brigade and later a Light Division were formed, at some points incorporating Portuguese &quot;Caçadores&quot;. By the Crimean War, rifles had become universal and tactics had substantially changed. This meant that the distinctions between light and line infantry were effectively limited to details such as name, a rapid march of 140 steps per minute, buglers instead of drummers and fifers, a parade drill which involved carrying rifles parallel to the ground (&quot;at the trail&quot;) and dark green cloth helmets instead of dark blue. Light infantry badges always incorporated bugle horns as a central feature.

In the Second World War, the use of light infantry was revived in what became the British Commandos and the Parachute Regiment. Because of the nature of their role and deployment, they were more lightly equipped than most infantry battalions. The Parachute Regiment has survived to this day, while the Royal Marine Commandos are directly descended from those units formed in the Second World War.

Most of the old light infantry and rifle regiments were administratively grouped in a new Light Division in 1968. The British Army ordered regimental amalgamations in 1957, 1966, 1990 and 2003. The Rifles (the largest infantry regiment in the British Army) was formed in 2007 from the amalgamation of the regiments of the Light Division. The Rifles maintain the traditional quick parade march of all British light infantry, the Rifle Brigade&#x27;s &quot;rifle green&quot; No 1 dress with blackened buttons and black leather belts, and many other traditions and &quot;golden threads&quot; of its parent regiments. The only rifle regiment not to become part of the Rifles was the Royal Gurkha Rifles. Following a series of amalgamations and one disbandment, none of the historic Light Infantry regiments now survive as separate entities within the modern British Army.

Today, &quot;Light role infantry&quot; is a designation that can be applied to an infantry battalion of any regiment. Light role infantry are not (by default) equipped with armoured vehicles (unlike Armoured Infantry or Mechanised Infantry).

===United States===
==== Colonial and Revolutionary War ====
In 1780, General George Washington published an order of battle which included a corps of light infantry, under the command of General Lafayette. The light infantry participated in several major battles of the southern states in 1781, including the Battle of Yorktown. The entire Continental Army was dismissed after the war, with all regiments disbanded in 1784.

==== 19th Century ====
In 1808, the United States Army created its first Regiment of Riflemen. During the War of 1812 three more Rifle Regiments were raised but disbanded after the war. The Rifle Regiment was disbanded in 1821.

In the Mexican–American War Colonel Jefferson Davis created and led the Mississippi Rifles.

Riflemen were listed as separate to infantry up to the American Civil War.

During the Civil War, Sharpshooter regiments were raised in the North with several companies being raised by individual states for their own regiments.

==== 20th Century ====
In the early years of World War 2 the US military saw the need for light forces. They designated the 82nd Division as the 82nd Airborne Division and reactivated the 101st division as the 101st Airborne Division in 1942. In 1943, the United States formed the 10th Light Division (Alpine), re-designated as the 10th Mountain Division in 1944. In 1983, General John A. Wickham Jr., Chief of Staff of the United States Army, announced the creation of five light infantry divisions to increase the U.S. Army&#x27;s ability to deploy quickly. These included the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 6th Infantry Division, 10th Mountain Division, as well as the 29th Infantry Division of the Army National Guard.

==== Modern US Military Light Infantry ====
* 82nd Airborne Division
* 101st Airborne Division
* 10th Mountain Division
* 25th Infantry Division
* 11th Airborne Division

In 2022 The US Army reactivated the 11th Airborne Division by reflagging two infantry brigades from the 25th Infantry division. Its mission is to conduct infantry operations in the Arctic.

<text>Mick Doyle (13 October 1941 – 11 May 2004) was an Irish rugby union international player and coach.

==Youth and playing career==

Doyle was born in Currow, County Kerry, and began playing rugby union at Newbridge College, County Kildare. He went on to study veterinary science at University College Dublin, who he also represented at rugby. He made his Ireland debut against France on 23 January 1965, scoring a try in the game. While representing Ireland he also studied at Cambridge University where he gained a Blue in the 1965 Varsity match against the Oxford University RFC. Doyle also studied at the University of Edinburgh and played club rugby for Edinburgh Wanderers before returning to Ireland.

He went on to earn the distinction of never being dropped during his 20-cap international career as a flanker. Doyler, as he was affectionately known, scored the winning try against Wales in 1967, toured Australia with Ireland in 1967 and South Africa with the British and Irish Lions the next year.

His last game for Ireland was against Australia in October 1968, when he lined out alongside his brother Tommy.

==Coaching==
He coached Leinster to Interprovincial Championship success five times between 1979 and 1983 before he succeeded Willie John McBride as Ireland coach during the 1984–85 season. Under Doyle&#x27;s stewardship in 1985 Ireland won the Triple Crown and Five Nations Championship.

He led Ireland to the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, but that joy was tinged with sadness as he suffered a heart attack at the opening dinner. He battled illness and adversity and his recovery from a brain problem was chronicled in his book &#x27;0.16&#x27;.

==Media==
After retiring from coaching, Doyle became a TV expert on RTÉ television, starting with the 1991 World Cup, and continuing both on live coverage and their &quot;Rugby After Dark&quot; Sunday night highlights programme until having to step down through ill-health in the late-90s.

Apart from working in his veterinary practice, he was a regular rugby contributor on RTÉ Radio One in the later years of his life.

Mick Doyle was killed in a car crash in Dungannon on 11 May 2004.
