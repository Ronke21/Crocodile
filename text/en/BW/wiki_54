<text>Democratic capitalism, also referred to as market democracy, is a political and economic system that integrates resource allocation by marginal productivity (synonymous with free-market capitalism), with policies of resource allocation by social entitlement. The policies which characterise the system are enacted by democratic governments.

Democratic capitalism was implemented widely in the 20th century, particularly in Europe and the Western world after the Second World War. The coexistence of capitalism and democracy, particularly in Europe, was supported by the creation of the modern welfare state in the post-war period. The implementation of democratic capitalism typically involves the enactment of policies expanding the welfare state, strengthening the collective bargaining rights of employees, or strengthening competition laws. These policies are enacted in a capitalist economy characterized by the right to private ownership of property.

Catholic social teaching offers support for a communitarian form of democratic capitalism with an emphasis on the preservation of human dignity.

== Definition ==
Democratic capitalism is a type of political and economic system characterised by resource allocation according to both marginal productivity and social need, as determined by decisions reached through democratic politics. It is marked by democratic elections, freedom, and rule of law, characteristics typically associated with democracy. It retains a free-market economic system with an emphasis on private enterprise.

Professor of Entrepreneurship Elias G. Carayannis and Arisitidis Kaloudis, Economics Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), describe democratic capitalism as an economic system which combines robust competitiveness with sustainable entrepreneurship, with the aim of innovation and providing opportunities for economic prosperity to all citizens. 

Edward Younkins, professor at Wheeling University, described democratic capitalism as a “dynamic complex of economic, political, moral-cultural, ideological, and institutional forces”, which serves to maximize social welfare within a free market economy. Younkins states that the system of individual liberty inherent within democratic capitalism supports the creation of voluntary associations, such as labour unions.

Philosopher and writer Michael Novak characterised democratic capitalism as a blend of a free-market economy, a limited democratic government, and moral-cultural system with an emphasis on personal freedom. Novak comments that capitalism is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition of democracy. He also proposes that the prominence of democratic capitalism in a society is strongly determined by the religious concepts which drive its customs, institutions, and leaders.

== History ==
=== Early to mid-20th century ===
The development of democratic capitalism was influenced by several historical factors, including the rapid economic growth following World War One, the Great Depression, and the political and economic ramifications of World War Two. The growing critique of free-market capitalism and the rise of the notion of social justice in political debate contributed to the adoption of democratic capitalist policies.

At the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, officials from the United States and the United Kingdom and forty-two other nations committed to trade openness. This commitment was made in conjunction with international guidelines which guaranteed autonomy for each country in responding to economic and social demands of its voters. Officials requested international capital controls which would allow governments to regulate their economies while remaining committed to the goals of full employment and economic growth. The adoption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade supported free trade, while allowing national governments to retain veto power over trade policy. Such developments saw the incorporation of democratic demands into policies based on capitalist economic logic.

Democratic capitalism was first widely implemented after the Second World War in the Western world, particularly in North America and Western Europe. Following the severe economic impacts of the war, working classes in the Western world were more inclined to accept capitalist markets in conjunction with political democracy, which enabled a level of social security and improved living standards. In the post-war decades, democratic capitalist policies saw reduced levels of socioeconomic inequality. This was synonymous with the expansion of welfare states, more highly regulated financial and labour markets, and increased political power of labour unions. According to political scientist Wolfgang Merkel, democracy and capitalism coexisted with more complementarity at this time than at any other point in history.

Policy makers in Europe and Asia adopted democratic capitalist policies in an attempt to satisfy the social needs of their voters and respond to the challenge of communism. The policies implemented supported the public provision of medical care, improved public housing, aged care, and more accessible education. Guarantees of full employment and the support of private research and innovation became priorities of policy makers. Policy developments were based on the rising notion that free markets required some state intervention to maintain them, provide structure, and address social inequities caused by them. Governments around the world regulated existing markets in an attempt to increase their equity and effectiveness. In order to stabilise the business cycle, the role of government was reconceived by anticommunist leaders in Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Scandinavia, and Japan. An emphasis was placed on supporting economic growth, promoting innovation, and enhancing living standards. This saw the expansion of educational opportunities and public insurance of basic health and aged benefits.

==== United States ====
As automated production expanded in the United States, demand for semi skilled workers increased. Combined with the expansion of secondary education, this saw the development of a large working class. The resulting strong economic growth and improved income equality allowed for greater social peace and universal suffrage. Capitalism was viewed as a means of producing the wealth which maintained political freedom, while a democratic government ensured accountable political institutions and an educated labour force with its basic rights fulfilled.

==== Europe ====
In the postwar period, free market economic systems with political systems of democracy and welfare states were established in France and Germany. This occurred under the leadership of the Popular Republican Movement in France and the Christian Democratic Union in Germany.

=== Late 20th century ===
Following the oil shocks of the 1970s and the productivity slowdown in the United States in the 1980s, politicians and voters maintained strong support for democratic capitalist policies and free markets. Globalisation and free trade were promoted as a means of boosting economic growth, and this saw the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the European Union. Labour market and competition regulations were eased in existing free-market economies, particularly in Anglo-America.

Rapid technological innovation and globalisation brought widespread international economic change. Publicly funded democratic capitalist policies were designed and implemented to compensate individuals negatively affected by major, structural economic change. Implemented beginning in the early years of the Cold War, such policies included unemployment benefits, universal or partially universal healthcare, and aged pensions. Post-1970s, the number of public sector jobs available expanded. Ageing populations in Europe, Japan and North America saw large increases in public spending on pensions and healthcare. In the 1980s, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies began reducing corporate taxation, though personal income taxes and public spending on social security programs generally remained stable.

Large-scale innovation in production technology throughout the 20th century had widespread economic benefits in many capitalist economies. These benefits contributed to the conciliation of democratic politics and free markets and the widespread acceptance of democratic capitalist policies by voters.

From the late 20th century, the tenets of democratic capitalism expanded more broadly beyond North America and Western Europe.

==== United States ====
After taking office as president in 1981, Ronald Reagan advocated for a reduced role of government in the economy, while responding to voters’ skepticism of liberal capitalism by maintaining strong public sector spending. Many voters doubted the ability of free market capitalism to provide consistent peace, security and opportunity, and sought improved living standards, aged care, and educational opportunities for youth. The Reagan administration maintained previous levels of government expenditure on Social Security and Medicare as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). Total government expenditure levels as a percentage of GDP also remained stable under the Reagan administration.

==== Europe ====
From the mid-1980s, European leaders began endorsing neoliberal ideas, such as those associated with Reaganomics and Thatcherism, based on the notion of the interdependence of economic and social policy. In this context, European competition law policy developed as a method of curbing the excesses of capitalism, while aligning the economy of the European Union with the existing democratic ideals of European society. This saw the advancement of democratic capitalism throughout the European region.

==== South Africa ====
The South African Competition Act of 1998 prioritised the eradication of anticompetitive business practices and the free participation in the economy of all citizens, while maintaining a pro-free-market economy.

=== Early 21st century ===
==== India ====
India enacted the Competition Act, 2002 to promote and sustain competition and protect the welfare of market participants, goals synonymous with democratic capitalism.

== Implementation ==
The post-war implementation of democratic capitalism saw the expansion of welfare states and the free collective bargaining rights of employees, alongside market policies designed to ensure full employment.

Under democratic capitalism, an autonomous democratic state enacts of policies which in effect create a compromise between upper and lower classes, while remaining compatible with free-market capitalism. Such policies include the establishment or expansion of a welfare state, as a method of mediating social class conflict and catering to the demands of workers.

The system is characterised by the establishment of cooperative economic institutions. This includes institutions which facilitate bargaining between government bodies and business and labour organisations such as unions, and those which regulate the relationships between employees and management within private firms. The development of institutions to promote cooperation among public and private economic entities acknowledges the benefits of market competition, while attempting to address the social problems of unrestrained capitalism.

Economic security concerns of citizens are addressed through redistributive policies. Such policies include income transfers, such as welfare payment programs and pensions, to support the financial needs of the elderly and the poor. Other policies which promote economic security include social insurance, and the fiscal financing of education and job training programs to stimulate employment. 

The right to private ownership of productive property is a central tenet of democratic capitalism, and is recognized as a basic liberty of all democratic citizens, as in a regular free-market capitalist economy. According to political philosopher John Tomasi, democratic capitalism addresses social entitlement and justice concerns through the preservation of citizens’ private property rights, allowing citizens to be “free, equal, and self-governing”.

The robust competitiveness and sustainable entrepreneurship which define democratic capitalism are characterised by top-down policies and bottom-up initiatives implemented by democratic governments. Top-down policies are planned and implemented by formal leaders in an organisation, while bottom-up policies involve gradual change initiated and sustained by lower-level members of organisations. Policies implemented are designed to incentivise public and private sector innovation. Examples include strong research and development funding, and policies which protect intellectual property rights.

=== Competition law ===
A characteristic of democratic capitalist economies is the democratic enactment of laws and regulations to support competition. Such laws include United States antitrust laws. Competition laws are designed to regulate private sector activities, including the actions of capital asset owners and managers, in order to prevent outcomes which are socially undesirable according to the democratic majority.

The implementation of competition law is intended to prevent anti-competitive behaviour that is harmful to the welfare of consumers, while maintaining a free market economy. The implementation of antitrust laws was found to be a characteristic of democratic capitalism specifically, and not regular free-market capitalism.

== Conflicts between notions of resource allocation ==
According to economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, the capitalist markets and democratic policies that characterise democratic capitalism are inherently conflicting. Streeck suggests that under democratic capitalism, governments tend to neglect policies of resource allocation by marginal productivity in favour of those of resource allocation by social entitlement, or vice versa. In particular, he comments that the accelerating inflation of the 1970s in the Western world can be attributed to rising trade-union wage pressure in labour markets and the political priority of full employment, both of which are synonymous with democratic capitalism.

== In Catholic social teaching ==
Catholic texts offer support for a form of socially regulated democratic capitalism. The papal encyclical &quot;Centesimus annus&quot;, written by Pope John Paul II, emphasizes a vision of a communitarian form of democratic capitalism. The communitarian system of democratic capitalism described promotes respect for individual rights and basic workers’ rights, a virtuous community, and a limited role for the state and the market. According to the encyclical, these characteristics should be combined with a conscious effort to promote institutions which develop character in individuals. The encyclical stressed to decision makers the importance of the dignity of the person and a concern for the poor, while acknowledging the need to balance economic efficiency with social equity. The US Bishops’ 1986 Pastoral Letter Economic Justice for All suggested that specific institutional arrangements be developed to support this form of democratic capitalism. Arrangements proposed included structures of accountability designed to involve all stakeholders, such as employees, customers, local communities, and wider society, in the corporate decision making process, as opposed to stockholders only. The letter offered acceptance for the market economy under the condition that the state intervene where necessary to preserve human dignity.

<text>The Country Club Plaza (often called The Plaza) is a privately owned regional shopping center in the Country Club District of Kansas City, Missouri. Opened in 1923, it is considered to be the first planned large outdoor suburban shopping center in the United States and among the first regional centers to accommodate shoppers arriving by car.

Planned in 1922 by J. C. Nichols and designed in Baroque Revival and Moorish Revival style echoing the architecture of Seville, Spain, The Plaza comprises numerous, large city blocks of high-end retail establishments, restaurants, and entertainment venues, as well as offices. The Country Club Plaza is named in the Project for Public Spaces&#x27; list &quot;60 of the World&#x27;s Great Places&quot;.

It encompasses a 14-block area, and includes 40 statues, fountains and sculptures; 12 towers; carriage rides and sidewalk cafes; and at one time, 180 shops and restaurants.

As of 2020, there were more than 70 stores and shops in 18 separate buildings representing of retail space and of office space.

==Location==
The site is about south of downtown, between 46th Street and Brush Creek to the north and south and between Mill Creek Parkway and Madison Avenue to the east and west. The Kansas state line is one mile (1.6 km) to the west. The neighborhoods surrounding the Plaza consist of upscale apartment buildings and mansions, especially those of the Country Club District built along Ward Parkway on the Plaza&#x27;s southern and southwestern side. The buildings are arrayed along a collection of streets at the northern edge of the Country Club District, which leads the center to blend in with the apartment and office buildings and houses that surround it.

The Country Club Plaza was named for the associated Country Club District, the neighborhood developed by J.C. Nichols which surrounded the Kansas City Country Club (now Loose Park). It is situated at the northern terminus of Ward Parkway, a boulevard known for its wide, manicured median lined with fountains and statuary that traverses the Country Club District. Nichols selected the location carefully to provide residents with a direct route to the Plaza along Ward Parkway. Nichols began acquiring the land for the Plaza in 1907, in an area of Kansas City that was then known as Brush Creek Valley. When his plans were first announced, the project was dubbed &#x27;Nichols&#x27; Folly&#x27; because of the then seemingly undesirable location; at the time, the only developed land in the valley belonged to the Country Day School (now the Pembroke Hill School), and the rest was known for pig farming.. Nichols employed architect Edward Buehler Delk to design the new shopping district. The Plaza was opened in 1923. It was the first regional shopping center designed with parking for automobile access, the first suburban center with common management and tenant selection, and the first with unified architecture. New Urbanist land developer Andres Duany noted in &quot;Community Builder: The Life &amp; Legacy of J.C. Nichols&quot; that the Country Club Plaza has had the longest life of any planned shopping center in the history of the world. One of its oldest retailers is the Jack Henry Clothing company, founded in 1931.

While the positive contributions that Nichols made to Kansas City and urban development are undeniable, there is a dark history of how his influence impacted marginalized communities within Kansas City. Nichols is responsible for &quot;redlining&quot; and residential covenants that kept Blacks, Jews, and other marginalized people from purchasing homes and living in the more desirable areas of Kansas City.

For its first four decades, the Plaza combined some higher-end shops, such as Harzfeld&#x27;s, with a mix of more mid-level retailers such as Sears and Woolworth&#x27;s, as well such quotidian enterprises as a bowling alley, movie theater, and a grocery store to serve the daily needs of residents of the district.. From around 1970, competition from newer suburban shopping malls led management to reposition the Plaza with luxury hotels such as the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, higher-end restaurants, and upscale retailers including Gucci, Polo Ralph Lauren, FAO Schwarz, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bally, and Swanson&#x27;s. Today, the Plaza is home to a number of high-end and unique-to-market stores including Tiffany &amp; Co., Michael Kors, Kate Spade New York, Eileen Fisher, Indochino, Free People, Tommy Bahama and Vineyard Vines. On September 12, 1977, a major flood of Brush Creek caused severe damage to the Plaza and resulted in a number of deaths. The flood prompted a vast renovation and revitalization of the area that has allowed it not only to survive but to thrive.

In 1998, the J.C. Nichols Company merged with Raleigh, North Carolina–based real-estate investment trust Highwoods Properties, which now runs the Country Club Plaza.

On February 19, 2013, a large explosion destroyed JJ&#x27;s Restaurant on the Plaza. Believed to be caused by a gas leak, the blast left at least one person dead and sixteen injured. According to a statement from Missouri Gas Energy, a contractor doing underground work struck a gas line. Witnesses had reported a strong odor of natural gas in the area most of the afternoon. The initial explosion happened shortly after 6 p.m. and led to a four-alarm fire that caused the restaurant&#x27;s complete destruction as well as damage to surrounding buildings. JJ&#x27;s returned in November 2014 to a new location, still in the Country Club Plaza area.

In 2016 Highwoods announced plans to sell the retail complex for $660 million to a 50-50 joint venture of Taubman Centers and The Macerich Company.

On February 2, 2018, Nordstrom announced it would be moving from Oak Park Mall in Overland Park, Kansas to a new space on the Country Club Plaza expected to open in fall 2023. The plans were cancelled in 2022.

In July 2024, HP Village Management acquired Country Club Plaza in Kansas City from Macerich and Taubman Centers.

==Layout and use==
The basic design of the Country Club Plaza reflects classic European influences, especially those of Seville, Spain, yet it does not include a traditional open plaza. There are more than 30 statues, murals, and tile mosaics on display in the area, as well as major architectural reproductions, such as a half-sized Giralda Tower of Seville (the tallest building in the Plaza). The Plaza also includes reproductions of San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Path of Gold&quot; streetlights. Other works of art celebrate the classics, nature, and historical American themes such as westward expansion, and a magnificent fountain featuring four horses rearing up on their hind legs, designed by Henri-Léon Gréber.

Although the Plaza was designed and built to accommodate visitors arriving by automobile, it is unlike modern shopping malls with sprawling parking lots: parking is concealed in multilevel parking garages beneath and behind the shops, or on the rooftops of buildings.

The Plaza was also the first shopping center to use the percentage lease, where rents are based on a percentage of the gross receipts of tenants. This concept was novel when Nichols invented it, but it is now a standard practice in commercial leases.

Several companies are based in the Country Club Plaza area, including American Century Investments, Russell Stover Candies, Inergy, Gates Bar-B-Q, Lockton, Polsinelli, and Block Real Estate Services.

==Plaza lights==
In 1925, a single strand of 16 colored-lights was placed above a doorway in the Country Club Plaza to celebrate Christmas. The number of lights increased annually, inspiring an official lighting ceremony that first took place in 1930. On Thanksgiving night, tens of thousands of people visit the Plaza for the local entertainment/performances and to watch the switch-throwing to initiate the Christmas season. A special guest or celebrity &quot;flips the switch&quot; each year. The Plaza&#x27;s &quot;Season of Lights&quot; is one of the city&#x27;s oldest traditions. The lights are turned on Thanksgiving evening and shine overnight through mid-January of the following year. The one or two-hour ceremony is broadcast live on local television station KMBC. During the 2018/2019 season, 8 year-old Kansas City resident Hazel Laurie suggested that if the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl, 
the lights should remain up the rest of the year.

<text>The Juniata River () is a tributary of the Susquehanna River, approximately long, in central Pennsylvania. The river is considered scenic along much of its route, having a broad and shallow course passing through several mountain ridges and steeply lined water gaps. It formed an early 18th-century frontier region in Pennsylvania and was the site of French-allied Native American attacks against English colonial settlements during the French and Indian War.

The watershed of the river encompasses an area of approximately , approximately one-eighth of the drainage area of the Susquehanna. Approximately two-thirds of the watershed is forested. It is the second largest tributary of the Susquehanna after the West Branch Susquehanna.

==Description==
The Juniata River forms in western Huntingdon County at the confluence of the Frankstown Branch and the Little Juniata River, between the boroughs of Alexandria and Petersburg. The river flows southeast through Huntingdon and continues to the small village of Ardenheim, where the Raystown Branch, the longest of the Juniata&#x27;s tributaries, enters from the southwest. The Juniata continues southeast, through a gap in the Jacks Mountain ridge. On the southeast side of the ridge it receives Aughwick Creek from the south, then flows northeast, along the eastern flank of the Jacks Mountain ridge to Lewistown, where it collects Kishacoquillas Creek and Jacks Creek. From Lewistown it flows southeast, in a winding course, receiving Tuscarora Creek from the south at the Port Royal river bridge and passing through a gap in the Tuscarora Mountain ridge. The Juniata River is joined by three creeks in Millerstown in northeast Perry County. It receives Cocolamus Creek southeast, Raccoon Creek southeast, and Wildcat Run southeast of Millerstown. The river also receives Buffalo Creek northwest of Newport. The Juniata River joins the Susquehanna River in Reed Township, Dauphin County immediately northwest of the Clarks Ferry Bridge. This is northeast of Duncannon and approximately northwest of Harrisburg.

Along the river&#x27;s banks there are many access areas maintained by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, as well as informal access areas and campground river access. The Juniata River is a popular spot for swimming, fishing, and boating. It even used to be the host of the Juniata River Sojourn, which was held annually from 2001 (when the river was named Pennsylvania River of the Year) through 2015.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Juniata&quot; is thought to be a corruption of the Iroquoian word &quot;Onayutta&quot;, meaning &quot;Standing Stone&quot;. There was a large standing stone where the town of Huntingdon now stands. It was reportedly tall and contained carvings recording the history of the local Juniata Tribe. It disappeared in 1754, when the tribe left; tradition says they took it with them. A second stone was raised by the new settlers but destroyed in 1897. A two-foot (0.6 m) fragment of the second stone sits in Juniata College&#x27;s museum.

==History==

The first known inhabitants of the river valley were the Onojutta-Haga Indians. The valley was later inhabited by the Lenape until a treaty negotiated by William Penn opened the land to east of the Allegheny Ridge to white settlement. In 1755–1756, as a result of Lenape anger over loss of their lands, the white settlement in the valley suffered fierce raids and abductions from Lenape and Shawnee at Kittanning on the Allegheny River. Over 3,000 white settlers were killed in the raids. The burning of Fort Granville at present-day Lewistown in 1756 prompted Pennsylvania governor John Penn to launch a reprisal against the Lenape and Shawnee led by Lt. Col. John Armstrong, who burned Kittanning in September 1756.

During the 19th century, the river was paralleled by the Juniata Division Canal, part of the canal system of Pennsylvania and a rival to the Erie Canal. The state sold the canal to the Pennsylvania Railroad, which abandoned the canal in 1889 after severe flooding. Parts of the original locks from the canal, as well as remnants of a dam approximately 1 mile (2 km) south of Millerstown, are still visible today.

The river is a popular destination for recreational canoeing and fly fishing, in particular for smallmouth bass and channel catfish suited to the river&#x27;s gentle course. The muskellunge was introduced as predatory sport fish and is now a prized catch. Attempts are underway by the state to reintroduce the once-prevalent American shad, which went into decline largely because of dams on the river. Walleye is another game fish prevalent in the Juniata River.

The National Book Award and Pulitzer prize-winning poet Galway Kinnell wrote of the river in a section of &quot;The Book of Nightmares&quot; (1971), entitled &quot;Dear Stranger, Extant in Memory by the Blue Juniata&quot; (&quot;The Blue Juniata&quot; was a well-known 19th-century parlor song).

The river cuts through several southwest-to-northeast ridges, largely of sandstone between limestone valley floors. Several of the river&#x27;s tributaries, including Kishacoquillas Creek, are degraded by pollution, but the main stem of the river is considered fairly clean by regional standards. The only city in the watershed with ten thousand or more residents is Altoona. Steep slopes along much of the river&#x27;s course have largely discouraged widespread development.

<doc id="647238" wikidata="Q675738" url="?curid=647238" title="Arlington Springs Man">
<text>Arlington Springs Man was an ancient Paleoindian, most likely a man, whose remains were found in 1959 on Santa Rosa Island, one of the Channel Islands located off the coast of Southern California. He lived about 13,000 years Before Present, making him the earliest dated adult in North America. It was an important scientific discovery because his presence on the island at this early date supports the coastal migration theory for the peopling of the Americas. In 2022, after a NAGPRA request, Arlington Springs Man was repatriated to the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians for reburial according to their native customs at an undisclosed location.

==History==
In 1959, the socialite and philanthropist Kitty Harvey, granddaughter of Fred Harvey and heir of the Fred Harvey Company, funded an archaeology expedition to the Channel Islands. It was under the leadership of Phil C. Orr, curator of anthropology and paleontology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, who had been prospecting the steep bluffs of Arlington Canyon annually since 1946. Orr and his associates were in the canyon at a location called Arlington Springs, where according to his memoir he was &quot;working&quot; - scientists who knew Orr reported his jeep had become stuck and they were actually working to extract it. At this point, Orr looked up the canyon wall and noticed what he thought was a femur bone eroding from a cut bank, later determined to be about 37 feet deep from the surface. Orr understood that at this depth it was probably a very old bone. He pointed it out to his associates who didn&#x27;t think it was important and kept working, but according to Orr, without his insistence to investigate further, they probably would have passed it by. In this way the discovery was notable, according to Orr, for being so improbable.

Two femur and other unidentified bone fragments bones were found. The bones were radiocarbon dated to 10,000 years Before Present, using the relatively primitive dating technology available at the time. The area was once marshy and the man had died on the edge of a ciénega, a type of marsh common in the region. According to Orr&#x27;s original paper the man may have died accidentally. Orr named him Arlington Springs Man, wrapped the bones in plaster, and stored them at the museum where they sat undisturbed and largely overlooked for the next 30 years.

Arlington Springs Man was later re-examined in 1989 by Orr&#x27;s successors at the museum, John R. Johnson and Don Morris. Newer radiocarbon dating technology determined the remains were actually as old as 13,000 years Before Present, making him the earliest dated (adult) individual in North America. It was also determined the bones were from a female. The moniker was changed to Arlington Springs &quot;Woman&quot;, but after more time and study, in 2006 Johnson reversed his assessment, concluding that the remains were more likely those of a man.

==Habitat==
Arlington Springs Man lived on Pleistocene-epoch Santa Rosae island. The weather was much cooler and the sea level was lower than today. During the last ice age, the four northern Channel Islands were held together as the one mega-island of Santa Rosae. At the time the island was inhabited by Pygmy mammoths, which it is supposed the Arlington Man&#x27;s people hunted, because at the same time full-sized Columbian mammoths were being hunted elsewhere in North America. The coastal regions of the island, which Paleo-Indians likely inhabited, has since been inundated by sea-level rise, meaning the location of Arlington Canyon was in the interior miles from the coast. 

His presence on an island at such an early date demonstrates that the earliest Paleoindians had watercraft capable of crossing the Santa Barbara Channel, and lends credence to a coastal migration theory for the peopling of the Americas, using boats to travel south from Siberia and Alaska. 

Six more field seasons have taken place between 1994 and 2008. No new human bones have been found, but chert microflakes derived from sharpening stone tools were discovered in the same soil layer that contained Arlington Man&#x27;s bones, along with discoveries about other flora and fauna.

==Custody and reburial==
Arlington Springs Man&#x27;s remains were held by the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History from the time of discovery in 1959. In April 2022, under the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), his remains were repatriated to the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians. The claim was made by the tribe in October 2021, along with a request to return other Chumash items held by the museum. NAGPRA mandates that Native American remains held in labs, museums, and private collections be repatriated to Native tribes. According to the museum president, they were &quot;honored to care for this important cultural heritage for many years and now find it deeply satisfying [to] transfer custody back to the Chumash community&quot;. Tribal Chair Kenneth Kahn stated that &quot;These items have come home to our tribe, and it allows us to do the important work of repatriation and reburial.&quot;

<doc id="647241" wikidata="Q826477" url="?curid=647241" title="Without a Trace">
<text>Without a Trace is an American police procedural drama television series created by Hank Steinberg that aired on CBS from September 26, 2002, to May 19, 2009 with the total of seven seasons and 160 episodes. The series focuses the cases of a Missing Persons Unit (MPU) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in New York City. It starred Anthony LaPaglia, Poppy Montgomery, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Enrique Murciano and Eric Close with Roselyn Sánchez joining the cast in season 4.

At the time of its original broadcast, &quot;Without a Trace&quot; was one of CBS″ most successful series, earning high television ratings and winning a Primetime Emmy Award. On May 19, 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of the series after seven seasons.

==Premise==
Each episode followed the search for one individual under tight time constraints. The stories also focused on the personal lives of the team members and illustrated how their experiences gave them insight into cases. The team consisted of Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia), Samantha Spade (Poppy Montgomery), Vivian Johnson (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), Danny Taylor (Enrique Murciano), Martin Fitzgerald (Eric Close), and Elena Delgado (Roselyn Sánchez), the last of whom joined the cast in the fourth season.

The real FBI does investigate missing persons; specifically, they have the authority to help in any &quot;mysterious&quot; disappearances of children abducted by nonfamily members. The groups that investigate these crimes are called Child Abduction Rapid Deployment teams. They get involved in other missing persons cases as needed but do not have a dedicated unit. One element that set the series apart from other TV police dramas was the display of information about real-life missing persons at the end of most episodes. This resulted in a kidnapped brother and sister being found on July 25, 2005. At least five people have been found as a result of those announcements. Occasionally, such information was replaced with other public-service announcements, such as an episode about an attempted suicide that presented information on a suicide help line. Showings outside the United States tend to omit missing persons information; however, Australia&#x27;s Nine Network usually showed Australian cases, and in Hong Kong, the TVB Pearl showed information about local missing persons during the first two seasons. &quot;Without a Trace&quot; took place within Jerry Bruckheimer&#x27;s &quot;&quot; universe. A crossover episode in 2007 featured characters Gil Grissom (William Petersen) from &quot;CSI&quot; and Jack Malone from &quot;Without a Trace&quot; working together to solve the same case.

==Production==
&quot;Without a Trace&quot; debuted as part of the CBS fall line-up in 2002, created by Hank Steinberg and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The show is the only primetime U.S. drama to feature two Australians (LaPaglia and Montgomery) and a Briton (Jean-Baptiste) playing Americans in the regular cast. It was the first show to achieve strong ratings opposite longtime NBC hit medical drama &quot;ER&quot; which, like &quot;Without a Trace,&quot; is produced by Warner Bros. Television.

&quot;Without a Trace&quot; ran on Thursdays at 10 pm until September 2006, when it was moved to Sundays. In the 2007–2008 season, it swapped timeslots with &quot;Shark,&quot; returning it to its old timeslot on Thursdays. However, this lasted only until the 2008–2009 season, when it moved to Tuesdays at 10pm.

The first two showrunners were Steinberg and Ed Redlich. Between seasons two and three, Redlich moved away from active participation in the series, with staff writers Jan Nash and Greg Walker taking over. In the middle of season four, Steinberg left to produce the series &quot;The Nine,&quot; while remaining executive producer.

=== Cancellation ===
On May 19, 2009, the morning the series finale aired, it was announced that the show had been cancelled. In season seven, the ratings sank lower, to an average of a 2.7 rating but climbed up to 12 million viewers and ranked 18th. However, CBS had to make a choice between renewing either &quot;Without a Trace&quot; or &quot;Cold Case&quot; due to budget cuts. They chose to keep &quot;Cold Case&quot;.

==Main cast==
==Season synopsis==
===Season 1===

The missing persons unit is headed up by the driven but morally compromised Jack Malone, whose professional successes are marred by his complicated personal life—he is in the midst of a messy breakup from his wife, precipitated by his own infidelity with his protege, Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Spade. At the outset of the series, Jack struggles to balance his crumbling marriage with the arrival of Martin Fitzgerald, a rookie agent whose placement Jack sees as a sinecure due to Fitzgerald&#x27;s father being a powerful figure in the FBI. The team ultimately find themselves forced to come together and personally reckon with the legacy of 9/11 when a powerful businesswoman whose company headquarters were destroyed in the Twin Tower attacks goes missing and her kidnapper—a man whose wife was killed in the World Trade Center—abducts Jack in order to forestall her rescue.

===Season 2===

As the team continues to track down missing people, Jack and his wife slide towards divorce, while Jack must also care for his father (Martin Landau) who has Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The team members&#x27; life histories are revealed, including the fact that Martin was practically raised by his aunt and uncle, and Danny is an orphan whose estranged brother Rafael (Alex Fernandez) is a convicted felon. Martin fatally shoots a child sex trafficker, and both Vivian and he must keep quiet to keep their jobs. Jack makes a last-ditch attempt to save his marriage by moving to Chicago with his family, giving Vivian a long-awaited promotion to his post, but at the last minute, his wife Maria (Talia Balsam) leaves without him, taking their daughters Hannah and Kate (Vanessa and Laura Marano) with her.

Following a campaign by the conservative group the Parents Television Council, CBS was fined a record $3.6 million for indecency for the sixth episode &quot;Our Sons and Daughters&quot;, which centered around a teenaged orgy. CBS argued that the episode &quot;featured an important and socially relevant storyline warning parents to exercise greater supervision of their teenaged children.&quot;

===Season 3===

Vivian loses her promotion when Jack returns to his job, causing some commotion among the team. She also experiences heart trouble that endangers her life and her career, and undergoes risky surgery. Martin and Samantha begin dating secretly, and because of disagreements between them on whether or not to reveal it to the rest of the team, it ends badly. Jack undergoes a brutal custody battle with his ex-wife. Danny has to confront his traumatic past, and Rafael. The season ends with a cliffhanger as a hired mercenary opens fire on Martin and Danny&#x27;s car while they transport a prisoner.

===Season 4===

After barely surviving the gun battle that ended season three, Martin must recover from near-fatal gunshot wounds while Danny battles post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stretched for help, the team gets a new member, Elena Delgado, a former NYPD vice-squad officer with an aggressive, streetwise attitude. She has a past connection to Danny, the nature of which is unknown until season five. Martin develops an addiction to painkillers, and Jack begins dating Anne Cassidy (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), the widow of a former mentor killed in the line of duty.

===Season 5===

Anne miscarries and abruptly breaks up with Jack. Danny and Elena begin dating, while her ex-husband Carlos Aguilar (Jsu Garcia) sues for custody of their daughter Sofie (Ashlyn Sanchez), and later abducts her. More about Samantha&#x27;s difficult past is revealed, including her strained relationships with her mother Patricia (Tess Harper) and older sister Emily (Molly Price). Jack is abducted and tortured by a psychotic woman, but initially appears to show few effects. At the end of the season, Carlos is freed, leaving the team worried about Elena&#x27;s safety, and a serial kidnapper appears to be preying on young women.

===Season 6===

Vivian is put in charge of a task force to locate the serial kidnapper, who is part of a sex-trafficking ring. Samantha discovers that she is pregnant from a one-night stand with a bartender at the time, Brian Donovan (Adam Kaufman), and by the end of the season, he waives paternal rights because of what Jack digs up on him and Sam confronting him about it, and she gives birth to her son Finn. Jack begins a pattern of roughing up suspects and intimidating people to make them talk, which appears to be related to PTSD. He also gets into a dangerous situation without backup and is nearly killed, and becomes overly involved in the life of a teenager he saved from the sex traffickers. In the season finale, he is demoted and put in mandatory therapy with Dr. Clare Bryson (Linda Hunt).

This season also contained a two-part crossover episode with &quot;&quot;, as Jack and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and their teams track down a serial killer responsible for the disappearance of a boy six years ago. Both episodes are included on the DVD collection for &quot;CSI&quot;&#x27;s eighth season.

&quot;Without a Trace&quot; completed 12 episodes of season six before the 2007–2008 WGA strike. Because the show&#x27;s writing staff all joined the strike, no more new episodes were made until the issue was settled. Once the strike ended, the show returned on April 3, 2008, with six episodes.

===Season 7===

The seventh and final season begins with the team getting a new boss, Clark Medina (Steven Weber), but he shortly gives Jack his position back. Jack and Sam&#x27;s relationship rekindles. Jack takes custody of his older daughter Hannah. Brian decides to be a father to Finn. Martin gets involved with Kim Marcus (Vanessa Marcil), but he eventually finds out that she was involved in a crime and arrests her. Jack and Sam mutually end their romantic relationship for good. Jack reconciles with Hannah. Sam begins living with Brian to raise Finn together. The team goes to Danny and Elena&#x27;s wedding.

<text>Symphony No. 103 in E major (H. 1/103) is the eleventh of the twelve London symphonies written by Joseph Haydn. This symphony is nicknamed The Drumroll after the long roll on the timpani with which it begins. It is from 1795, and his second-to-last symphony.

==Composition and premiere==

The symphony was the eleventh of twelve that were composed for performance in England during Haydn&#x27;s two journeys there (1791–1792, 1794–1795), arranged and organized by the great impresario, Johann Peter Salomon. Haydn&#x27;s music was well known in England well before the composer traveled there, and members of the British musical public had long expressed the wish that Haydn would visit. The composer&#x27;s reception in England was in fact very enthusiastic, and the English visits were one of the most fruitful and happy periods of the composer&#x27;s life. Haydn composed the &quot;Drumroll&quot; Symphony while living in London during the winter of 1794–1795.

It was premiered on March 2, 1795 as part of a concert series called the &quot;Opera Concerts&quot; at the King&#x27;s Theatre. The orchestra was unusually large for the time, consisting of about 60 players. The task of directing the work was divided between the concertmaster, the violinist Giovanni Battista Viotti, and Haydn, who sat at a fortepiano. The premiere was evidently a success, and &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s reviewer wrote:

The &quot;Sun&quot; wrote:

Haydn later performed the work in Vienna, and for this purpose made a small cut in the final movement, which is usually respected by conductors today.

Since its premiere, the &quot;Drumroll&quot; Symphony has been a favorite among Haydn&#x27;s symphonies, and it is frequently performed and recorded today. In 1831, Richard Wagner arranged it for piano.

The symphony takes about 30 minutes to perform.

==Scoring==

The work is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings.

==Movements==

The work is in standard four-movement form.

===I. Adagio – Allegro con spirito===

After the opening drum roll, the bass instruments play a somber opening theme:

As commentators have pointed out, the first four notes of which match the Dies Irae chant, part of the Latin mass for the dead:

H. C. Robbins Landon has remarked that at the start the theme is ambiguous between duple and triple time and between the keys of C minor and (what ultimately proves the case) E major.

The sprightly &quot;Allegro con spirito&quot; that follows this introduction is in sonata form and time with an extended transition to the secondary theme. In a number of places, it restates the theme of the introduction in much faster tempo. Haydn restates part of the opening introduction in the coda, a formal procedure previously adopted by Mozart in his String Quintet K. 593 (1790). Beethoven was to do the same in his &quot;Pathétique&quot; piano sonata, published four years after the &quot;Drumroll&quot; Symphony in 1799.

===II. Andante più tosto allegretto===

In double variation form, with alternating themes in C minor and C major plus coda. The double variations had been a favorite musical form of the composer for about 20 years. Along with the Piano Trio H. XV:23 from the same year, this was the last set he wrote. The themes are said to have been developed by Haydn from Croatian folk songs he knew – for discussion, see Haydn and folk music. Some different features in this movement include a long violin solo, as well as the lack of clarinets.

===III. Menuetto===

The minuet is in the home key of E major. Charles Rosen, in &quot;The Classical Style&quot;, chose this minuet to illustrate the point that Classical-era minuets often have very strong first beats, in contrast to the more flowing rhythm of the Baroque minuet.
===IV. Finale: Allegro con spirito===

The finale is in fast tempo, has a monothematic exposition, and is in sonata rondo form. Like the first movement, it begins with a quasi-ritual gesture – in this case, a horn call:
The horn call is followed by a pause, then repeated as accompaniment to the main theme, and indeed echoed throughout the movement.

Like the themes of the second movement, the opening melody was claimed by Franjo Kuhač to be taken by Haydn from Croatian folk song, in this case a tune called &quot;Divojčica potok gazi&quot; (&quot;A little girl treads on a brook&quot;).

Robbins Landon notes that this finale is one of the longest in the London Symphonies. He calls it &quot;one of the great &quot;tours-de-force&quot;, formally speaking, of Haydn&#x27;s career: the creation of a long movement on a single theme in which our interest never flags; on the contrary, it is a Finale of unusual tension and strength.&quot;

Rather unusually for Haydn, he altered the fourth movement after it was completed, removing 13 bars fairly close to the end. The original autograph score preserves this music; it modulates to the key of C major and includes a two-measure rest; with the dynamic markings and . Robbins Landon suggests that Haydn removed the passage because it &quot;would hold up the course of the movement.&quot; The symphony is occasionally performed with the deleted passage included; e.g. in recorded versions by Antal Doráti and Frans Brüggen.

<text>The Parliament of the Republic of Fiji is the unicameral legislature of the Republic of Fiji. It consists of 55 members elected every 4 years using open list proportional representation in one multi-member nationwide constituency.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===

The Fijian Parliament dates from 10 October 1970, when Fiji became independent from the United Kingdom. The Parliament replaced the former colonial legislative body, the Legislative Council, which had existed in various forms throughout the entire colonial period. A grandfather clause in the 1970 Constitution, which was adopted on independence, provided for the old Legislative Council to be renamed as the House of Representatives and remain in office, pending the first post-independence elections in 1972.

=== Interruptions ===

Since independence, Parliamentary rule has been interrupted three times. The first interruption was from 1987 through 1992, owing to two coups d&#x27;état in 1987 instigated by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka. The second interruption occurred when a coup in 2000 attempted by George Speight rendered the parliamentary system unworkable and resulted in Parliament&#x27;s dissolution. A general election in 2001 restored the democratic system. The Republic of Fiji Military Forces under the leadership of Frank Bainimarama overthrew the government again in 2006. No further elections would be held until the September 2014 election.

=== Composition ===

The composition of Parliament has changed over the years. From 1972 to 1987, there were 52 Representatives and 22 Senators. In 1992, Parliament was enlarged to 70 Representatives and 34 Senators, figures marginally adjusted in 1999 to provide for 71 Representatives and 32 Senators. 25 of these were elected by universal suffrage. The remaining 46 were reserved for Fiji&#x27;s ethnic communities and were elected from communal electoral rolls: 23 Fijians, 19 Indo-Fijians, 1 Rotuman, and 3 &quot;General electors&quot; (Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities). The upper chamber of the parliament, the Senate, had 32 members, formally appointed by the President on the nomination of the Great Council of Chiefs (14), the Prime Minister (9), the Leader of the Opposition (8), and the Rotuman Islands Council (1).

The Senate was less powerful than the House of Representatives; the Senate could not initiate legislation, but it could reject or amend it. The Senate&#x27;s powers over financial bills were more restricted: it could veto them in their entirety, but could not amend them. The House of Representatives could override a Senatorial veto by passing the bill a second time in the parliamentary session immediately following the one in which it was rejected by the Senate, after a minimum period of six months. Amendments to the Constitution were excepted: the veto of the Senate was absolute. Following the passage of a bill by the House of Representatives, the Senate had 21 days (7 days in the case of a bill classified as &quot;urgent&quot;) to approve, amend, or reject it; if at the expiry of that period the Senate had done nothing about it, it was deemed to have passed the bill. As a result of the parliament building having only one debating chamber, the Senate and House of Representatives used the same chamber at different times.

=== Unicameral system ===

The 2013 Constitution promulgated by the military-backed interim government abolished the Senate and the House of Representatives, instituting a single-chamber 50-member Parliament. Section 54(2) of the Constitution requires the Fiji Electoral Commission to review the composition of the parliament at least one year before a general election and may if necessary increase or decrease the total number of members. In its review the commission will ensure that ratio of members to the population is the same as the ratio at the date of the first general election under this Constitution. Furthermore, the commission is required to consider the most recent census, the Register of Voters or any other official information available when undertaking its review. Accordingly, the Parliament had 50 seats up for election in 2014, 51 in 2018, and 55 in 2022.

==Structure==

The Parliament of Fiji consists of 55 members (plus a speaker) and is led by the prime minister, who is the leader of the largest party of government. The current Parliament was elected in the 2022 election, with a coalition of the People&#x27;s Alliance, the National Federation Party (NFP), and the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) holding a majority of 29 seats. FijiFirst, led by Frank Bainimarama, holds 26 seats and is the sole opposition party. The current prime minister is Sitiveni Rabuka.

=== Speakers ===
The salary of the speaker is FJ$150,000 annually.

<doc id="647260" wikidata="Q171350" url="?curid=647260" title="Jarno Trulli">
<text>Jarno Trulli (; born 13 July 1974) is an Italian former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Trulli won the 2004 Monaco Grand Prix with Renault.

He regularly competed in Formula One from 1997 to 2011, driving for Minardi, Prost, Jordan, Renault, Toyota and Lotus. His best result in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship was sixth place in , also the year in which he scored his sole victory at the . Throughout his Formula One career, Trulli was renowned for his skill in qualifying, regularly achieving far better grid positions than rivals with superior cars to his own. He was also known for his defensive driving style which allowed him to successfully hold off quicker drivers, sometimes for an entire race. The combination of being able to achieve high grid positions in relatively slow cars, combined with his ability to hold off faster drivers, would often result in a line of vehicles forming behind him during a race, commonly referred to as the &#x27;Trulli Train&#x27; by fans and media.

Trulli was set to remain in Formula One for , but retired before the season began. He competed in the inaugural season of Formula E, founding and competing for Trulli GP. Trulli is the father of racing driver Enzo Trulli.

==Early life and career==
His parents were motorsport fans and named their son after Jarno Saarinen, the Finnish Grand Prix motorcycle racing champion who was killed at Monza in 1973. He started racing in karts at an early age; after winning the Karting World Championship in 1991, the Italian karting championship and several other karting championships in different categories up to 1995, Trulli won the German Formula Three Championship in 1996.

==Formula One career==

===Minardi and Prost (1997–1999)===
In 1997, Trulli made his debut in Formula One with Minardi. After 7 races he replaced the injured Olivier Panis at Prost and impressed immediately, finishing fourth in Germany and even leading in Austria, looking set to finish second until his engine blew. He stayed at the Prost team for the next two seasons and eventually scored his first podium in wet conditions at the 1999 European Grand Prix. However, this was a rare highlight in a race few of the main front-runners finished, and the poor performance of the Prost team convinced him that a switch to Jordan would bring improved results.

===Jordan (2000–2001)===

In he moved to the Irish squad, but the team was no longer the force it had been in the late 1990s. In his two years with Jordan, Trulli failed to score a podium, but did impress with a series of brilliant qualifying displays. During this period suggestions were made that Trulli was more of a qualifying specialist than an out-and-out fast race driver, a charge he frequently denied. Under a long-term contract with his personal manager (and Renault manager) Flavio Briatore, Trulli secured a contract with the Anglo-French squad for .

===Renault (2002–2004)===

Alongside Jenson Button, he often outqualified his British teammate, but was generally shaded in races. Regardless of Button&#x27;s improved pace that season, it was Trulli who stayed at Renault for 2003 to partner promoted test-driver Fernando Alonso. The 2003 Renault was a strong car and in Alonso&#x27;s hands won in Hungary. Trulli struggled to attain similar results, but did achieve a podium in Germany, his first since leaving Prost.

Mindful of how much Alonso had outperformed him in , Trulli improved markedly the next year. For the first half of the season he was the better of the two Renault drivers, racking up regular points and podiums. At Monaco he finally took his only victory after a brilliant display from pole position. Having performed so well, the Italian was eager to stick with the team for 2005, but his relationship with team-boss Briatore soured. A last corner error which allowed Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello onto the podium in France enraged the team, and from that point his days with the French manufacturer were numbered. He did not score any points after the French Grand Prix and was consistently off the pace during races. He later accused the team of favouring Alonso, but the reasons why his 2004 season deteriorated have never been properly identified. He was sacked three races before the end of the season and replaced by World Champion Jacques Villeneuve, despite leading his teammate in the championship at that point. Trulli had already agreed to drive for Toyota in 2005, and his early exit from Renault allowed him to take up his new seat for the last two races of the 2004 season, replacing Ricardo Zonta.

===Toyota (2004–2009)===
====2004–2005====
In 2005, early season podiums demonstrated Trulli&#x27;s speed and at Indianapolis he took Toyota&#x27;s first Formula One pole. However, he, his teammate and the majority of the grid, did not enter the race due to using Michelin tyres, which were not safe to race. For the vast majority of the year he outpaced his highly paid teammate Ralf Schumacher, but a late season dip in form saw him slip to seventh in the championship, two points behind the German.

====2006====
In , Trulli suffered a very poor start to the season. On the first lap of the , he was taken out by David Coulthard. He seemed to be outpaced by teammate Ralf Schumacher more often than not, but finally scored his first points of the season when he raced to 6th from 4th on the grid at the . Following this was a 4th place in the . From then on, he would only score 3 more times, with a couple of 7th-place finishes in the and the and also a 6th place in the , where his car became troublesome to drive mid-race, and Ralf Schumacher was delayed in the process. Trulli was racing very well in the season finale at Interlagos, but his car suffered suspension failure in the first 10 laps, a fate which befell his teammate at the same time. He finished 12th overall.

====2007====

Trulli scored his first points of in Malaysia, finishing in 7th place after qualifying 8th. A couple more points followed in Bahrain, but he stalled on the grid at the start of the and dropped out during the early laps due to mechanical failure. Monaco brought no better fortune for Trulli, as he finished down in 15th place, just ahead of teammate Schumacher, after qualifying his season-worst 14th. Points were collected by Trulli at the Indianapolis for 6th place. After a series of non-scoring runs, Trulli said that the result was &#x27;incredible&#x27;. He also qualified well for the but crashed with the Renault of Heikki Kovalainen on the opening lap, and duly retired because of the damage. Trulli accepted the blame for the incident. The second half of the season was disappointing with Trulli&#x27;s only point coming in the final race of the season at Brazil.

Trulli finished the championship in 13th position, collecting only 8 points. Post season there had been reports that Trulli&#x27;s contract was not safe, and that he may have been replaced in the Toyota team for 2008 by Heikki Kovalainen. These proved unfounded as Kovalainen signed for McLaren.

====2008====

In , Trulli was hoping Toyota would make a big step forward. Timo Glock was confirmed as his teammate for the season. Trulli started the season quite well, with several points scoring finishes, the height of which was a fourth-place finish in Malaysia. Trulli&#x27;s qualifying performances were also very good throughout the first few rounds of the Championship. His form then slumped a little, with disappointing performances in Turkey and Monaco, as he finished in non-points scoring positions.

However, he bounced back from this with a 6th-place finish in Montreal. He then topped that in France by finishing on the podium in 3rd place, holding off the challenge of Heikki Kovalainen and Robert Kubica in the closing laps.

He qualified on the front row alongside pole-sitter Felipe Massa for the season-ending , which was to decide the 2008 world championship between Massa and Lewis Hamilton. During the race, Trulli had several close shaves in the changeable weather conditions, and eventually finished 8th. His teammate Glock played a pivotal part in the title outcome as he was passed by Hamilton on the last corner of the race, which gave the Englishman the championship by one point from Massa, who won easily. Trulli finished 8th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship standings, collecting 31 points, 4 more than his teammate.

====2009====

Trulli was confident going into . In the first race of the 2009 season, the Toyotas of Trulli and Glock started the race from the pitlane as their qualifying times were disallowed due to Toyota&#x27;s flexible rear wing breaching regulations. Although Trulli started from the pit lane, he finished in an impressive 3rd place before being penalised 25 seconds, dropping him to 12th position for passing Lewis Hamilton under the safety car. A few days after this decision, Hamilton was disqualified from the race results for &#x27;misleading&#x27; the race stewards by insisting that Jarno Trulli had passed him under the Safety Car although Hamilton in fact let him pass on purpose due to an order given by the team from the pitlane. Jarno Trulli therefore regained his third-place finish. At the , Trulli qualified on pole position but due to an unconventional tyre strategy, he finished third. However he did record the fastest lap, the only time he has achieved this in his career. He holds the record of having started the most Grands Prix before recording a fastest lap.

He crashed out of the after being forced off the track at the second corner and being collected by Adrian Sutil, and then had a poor performance in Monaco as the Toyotas qualified on the back row of the grid. Improvements saw him score points in three of the next four races, before the following four rounds saw him struggle again as he failed to finish in the Top 10. At the he placed 12th while teammate Glock was second. Trulli then fought back at the  – which would prove to be Toyota&#x27;s last home race – by qualifying and finishing second. 

He then qualified fourth in torrential conditions in Brazil, but like in Spain collided with Adrian Sutil on the opening lap of the race, an incident which enraged Trulli as he blamed Sutil for the crash. His obvious display of anger towards Sutil (who also retired) afterwards earned him a $10,000 fine. Trulli finished seventh at the season finale in Abu Dhabi scoring his final points in Toyota F1&#x27;s last race.

===Lotus (2010–2011)===

====2010====

On 14 December 2009, Trulli was confirmed as one of the newly formed Lotus team&#x27;s drivers, joining former McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen. He only finished one of the opening four races, a weaker reliability record than Kovalainen, leading him to note that &quot;everything happens on my car and my car only – so to this day, my expectations have not been met&quot;.

At the launch of the Lotus T127, Trulli admitted in an interview with Autosport that US F1 and Sauber had been in contact with him. In late 2009, Trulli was asked to test a NASCAR stock car in North America for Toyota. The car was set up by Michael Waltrip Racing.

====2011====

Trulli continued to drive for Lotus in , with Lotus Racing being renamed Team Lotus. He again partnered Heikki Kovalainen.

Trulli&#x27;s season started with thirteenth in Australia, before a retirement with a clutch problem in Malaysia. Trulli finished each of the next six races, equalling his best season finish of thirteenth in Monaco. In Britain, he retired with an oil leak. For the , Trulli was replaced by reserve driver Karun Chandhok. When he returned in Hungary, he retired due to a water leak; his teammate Kovalainen retired some laps later with an identical problem. He finished 14th at both the and the , where it was announced that Trulli would be retained for the season. After retiring in Singapore with a gearbox failure, Trulli finished 19th in Japan, 17th in Korea and 19th again, in India.

===Caterham (2012)===

Team Lotus was renamed to Caterham F1 ahead of the 2012 season. Trulli drove in one pre-season test, but on 17 February 2012 it was announced that Trulli was replaced by Vitaly Petrov. Following, Trulli stated that he was &quot;really proud&quot; to have helped Caterham become a Formula One team. 

This left Formula One without an Italian driver for the first time since , until Antonio Giovinazzi competed in the 2017 Australian Grand Prix.

==Other ventures==

===Trulli GP (2014–2015)===

In 2014–15 season Trulli drove in the inaugural FIA Formula E Championship for his own team Trulli GP in partnership with Drayson Racing Technologies and Super Nova Racing, as announced on 18 June 2014. After failing to pass scrutineering of their new drivetrain for the first two races of the 2015–16 season, the team withdrew from the championship.

==Helmet==

Trulli&#x27;s original helmet design was white with a blue shape around the visor with a blue circle in the top and a green J with a red T in the sides. A ring around the blue circle was incorporated when he raced at Jordan and Renault, being coloured after the team&#x27;s main sponsor. In 2004 his helmet changed from white to chromed silver and the shape, the J and the T became chromed with black outline. Later, in his first Toyota years the top became red and was added a white ring around the red circle. Finally in 2008 the helmet turned red with the J and the T of the original colours (and white outline) plus a white line on the chin area. From his Lotus years, the helmet design remained intact, with the change of the shades of colour from chromed to normal shades (the chromed silver becomes white).

==Personal life==
Trulli is married to Barbara and they have two sons, Enzo Trulli (b. 2005), named after Trulli&#x27;s father, and Marco (b. 2006), and a daughter Veronica (b. 2014). He is the co-owner of a vineyard in the Abruzzo region in Italy and produces his own wine. He also has his own range of Karts named &#x27;Trulli Kart&#x27;; Trulli himself was a World Champion at Karting level. His son Enzo is also pursuing career in motorsports he competed in the WSK karting series, before starting single seater racing in F4 UAE in 2021, and for 2022 at present in FIA Formula 3 Championship.

Born in São Paulo and raised in Botucatu, Massa started his career in karting aged eight, winning national and regional championships before progressing to junior formulae in 1998. Massa won several championships in Formula Chevrolet and Formula Renault, before winning the Euro Formula 3000 Championship in 2001 with Draco. Massa signed for Sauber in to partner Nick Heidfeld, making his Formula One debut at the . Despite scoring several points finishes in his rookie season, Massa was replaced by Heinz-Harald Frentzen in and became a test driver for Ferrari.

Massa took his maiden win from pole position at the , and became the first Brazilian driver since Ayrton Senna to win his home Grand Prix. He then took several wins in a four-way title battle with Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and new teammate Kimi Räikkönen, with the latter taking the championship. Massa took six wins in his campaign, but lost the World Drivers&#x27; Championship by one point to Hamilton on the last lap of the last race of the season. Details later emerged of race-fixing at the —commonly known as &quot;Crashgate&quot;—which Massa claims lost him the title, taking legal action against the FIA in 2023. 

At the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Massa was seriously injured during qualifying when a suspension spring from the Brawn BGP 001 of Rubens Barrichello struck his helmet at , and was replaced by Luca Badoer and Giancarlo Fisichella for the remainder of the season. Massa returned to Ferrari in to partner Fernando Alonso, briefly leading the championship after the . After struggling for form over the next three seasons, Massa left Ferrari at the conclusion of his campaign, having contributed to two World Constructors&#x27; Championships. Massa partnered Valtteri Bottas at Williams in , taking his first pole position in six years at the amongst several podiums. He took multiple podiums the following season with Williams, before announcing his retirement at the end of . The abrupt retirement of Nico Rosberg, however, saw Bottas move to Mercedes and Massa postpone his retirement to the end of the season, having achieved 11 wins, 16 pole positions, 15 fastest laps and 41 podiums in Formula One. 

Outside of Formula One, Massa competed in Formula E from 2018 to 2020 for Venturi, and has competed in the Stock Car Pro Series in Brazil since 2018.

In kart racing, Massa hosted the charity Desafio Internacional das Estrelas race until 2014, and was the president of the Commission Internationale de Karting from 2017 to 2022.

==Early life==
Massa was born in São Paulo and grew up in Botucatu, in São Paulo countryside. He is of Italian descent. His grandparents come from the town of Cerignola, in the province of Foggia, Italy.

He began karting when he was 8 years old, finishing fourth in his first season. He continued in national and international championships for 7 years, and in 1998 moved into Formula Chevrolet, finishing the Brazilian championship in fifth place. During the following season, he won 3 of the 10 races and claimed the championship.

In 2000, Massa moved to Europe to compete in the Italian Formula Renault series, winning both the Italian and the European Formula Renault championships that year. He could have moved to Formula Three, but instead chose the Euro Formula 3000, where he won 6 of the 8 races and the 2001 championship. He was then offered a Formula 1 test with the Sauber team, who signed him for 2002. He also drove for Alfa Romeo in the European Touring Car Championship as a guest driver.

==Formula One career==

===Sauber (2002, 2004–2005)===

In his rookie year in Formula 1, Massa was paired with 1999 International Formula 3000 champion Nick Heidfeld. He proved he was a competitive driver, but made several mistakes, including spinning off the track several times. Nevertheless, Massa scored 4 championship points in his first season, his best result a 5th place at the at the Circuit de Catalunya. After picking up a 10-place grid drop for an incident during the , he was dropped for the in an attempt to circumnavigate the penalty, being replaced by Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Massa returned to the driver&#x27;s seat for the , but Sauber confirmed that Frentzen would partner Heidfeld in , leaving Massa without a race seat. Instead, he spent a year with Sauber&#x27;s engine suppliers, Ferrari, gaining experience by testing for the championship-winning team.

Sauber then re-signed Massa for the season. In 2004, he scored 12 of Sauber&#x27;s 34 points, his best result being a fourth place at the . Giancarlo Fisichella scored the team&#x27;s other 22 points. Massa remained at Sauber in . Though he scored only 11 points, he outpaced his teammate Jacques Villeneuve through most of the season, and beat him in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. In an August 2022 interview, Massa revealed that after Sauber was taken over by BMW, they offered him a 3-year contract with the team, however Ferrari exercised their option on him to replace the outgoing Rubens Barrichello, who had signed for Honda for the 2006 season. Massa was then released and replaced by his former teammate Heidfeld and joined Ferrari to partner Michael Schumacher.

===Ferrari (2006–2013)===
====2006====
Massa qualified second at the opening race in Bahrain, and came from 21st position to 5th in Malaysia, beating teammate Michael Schumacher, who had started from 14th. In Bahrain, however, in both Saturday practice and the race, Massa spun, narrowly missing Fernando Alonso, the eventual winner of the race. At the Australian GP he crashed his Ferrari in qualifying, then collided with Christian Klien and Nico Rosberg at the first corner of the race. Nevertheless, he scored his first career podium at the Nürburgring, finishing third behind Michael Schumacher and Alonso. He also set the fastest lap at Barcelona in 2006. He had four more podium finishes in 2006, and took his first F1 pole position and his first F1 win at the at the Istanbul Park circuit.

Originally, Ferrari had intended to use Massa only for the 2006 season, for they had already signed McLaren&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen to partner Schumacher for the 2007 season in 2005. However his future at Ferrari was secured when Michael Schumacher announced in September 2006 that he would retire from Formula One at the end of the season. On 22 October, Massa won his home race at the , the first time a Brazilian driver had won at Interlagos since Ayrton Senna in 1993. Massa finished the season third with 80 points, behind world champion Alonso and Ferrari teammate Schumacher.

====2007====

Massa topped the time sheets on five occasions and set the fastest lap for four circuits during the pre-season testing.
However, his 2007 season began with problems. At the season opening , he suffered a gearbox problem during qualifying and required an engine change. Massa started the race from 22nd position due to these problems and a 10-grid-slot penalty for the engine change. He employed a one pitstop strategy for the race and finished in sixth place. Massa&#x27;s problems continued in Malaysia, where despite qualifying on pole position, the McLarens of Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton overtook him at turn one. Massa ran off the track while attempting to overtake Hamilton, and lost two more places, dropping down to fifth place, where he finished the race. However, his season subsequently improved, as he won the Grands Prix of Bahrain and Spain, both from pole position, and finished third in Monaco. The race stewards at the disqualified Massa for leaving the pit lane while the red light was showing. After this disqualification, he won one more race at the , and finished on the podium at six more races, including a second-place finish at his home Grand Prix at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Massa led much of the Brazilian Grand Prix, until yielding the lead to teammate Kimi Räikkönen, thus securing Räikkönen&#x27;s world championship title. Massa finished the 2007 season ranked fourth in the drivers&#x27; standing with 94 points.

In October 2007, Massa extended his contract with Ferrari to the end of 2010.

====2008====
Ferrari appeared off the pace at the first race of 2008 in Australia. Massa qualified fourth, but spun off at the first corner of the first lap. On lap 26 he collided with David Coulthard and eventually retired due to engine failure.

In Malaysia, he qualified on pole, half a second clear of Räikkönen in second. He led from pole for the first 16 laps but was jumped by Räikkönen in the pitstops. He was still in contention for the victory battle and was chasing Räikkönen until he spun off and retired on lap 31 while in second.

Massa went into the (where he had won in ) with no points. Robert Kubica beat him to pole in qualifying. but at the start, Massa passed Kubica before the first corner. Räikkönen soon got up to second but he could not do a repeat of Malaysia. Massa was quicker and won by 3 seconds to score his first points of the season.

In Spain, Massa qualified third behind Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso. He passed Alonso at the start and got up to second behind Räikkönen. He stayed on his teammate&#x27;s tail for the whole race, but was unable to pass or get ahead in the stops.

Massa took pole position at the next round at Turkey. He led from the start, and maintained the lead during the round of pit stops, but was passed by Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s three-stopping McLaren at the start of the second stint. Hamilton pulled away, but he did not have the pace to take the lead that was needed to make his third stop and still come out ahead of Massa. Massa was seven seconds up the road by then and took his second win of the season, and his third consecutive at the circuit.

At Monaco Massa qualified on pole and built up a 15-second lead over Räikkönen in the rain, before that advantage was wiped out by the safety car. Soon Räikkönen was out of contention with a drive-through penalty. After the safety car came in, Massa again started pulling away from Robert Kubica, but he ran up an escape road and lost the lead. Massa did jump Kubica in the pitstops, but Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s one-stopping McLaren was by now ahead of both of them. During the pit stops, Massa was fuelled to the end of the race and was struggling, holding Kubica up. The track dried out and Massa had to pit for slick tyres while Kubica took his second fuel stop at the same time and jumped him. Massa thus finished third behind Hamilton and Kubica.


In the , Massa qualified in 6th place. In the race there was a safety car due to an incident involving Adrian Sutil. All drivers pitted, but Massa had to pit twice due to a delay with his fuel rig, which put him down to 17th. He then staged a fightback, charging back up to fifth place by the end of the race. Two of Massa&#x27;s title contenders failed to finish after Hamilton collided with a stationary Räikkönen in the pitlane, allowing Massa to equal Hamilton and overtake Räikkönen in the driver standings.

In the , Massa qualified 2nd on the grid behind his teammate Räikkönen. Massa stayed some 3 to 4 seconds behind his teammate for the first half of the race. However, Räikkönen had a developing problem in his exhaust system, which allowed Massa to overtake him and win the race. This win gave Massa the lead in the championship, two points ahead of Robert Kubica, five points ahead of Räikkönen and 10 points ahead of Hamilton. Massa was the first Brazilian to lead the championship since Ayrton Senna in .

In the , Massa set the quickest time in first practice but immediately crashed. He had his season&#x27;s worst qualifying, starting in 9th. In the wet race, while Hamilton dominated and Räikkönen finished fourth, Massa spun five times and finished last in 13th, over a lap down behind both his rivals. And so, at the end of the halfway stage of the season, Hamilton, Massa and Räikkönen were deadlocked on 48 points, with Robert Kubica only two points behind them.

The tenth round of the season was in Germany. Massa qualified 2nd behind Hamilton. He stayed second and was set to finish there until a crash involving Timo Glock brought out the safety car. Due to a miscommunication, Hamilton stayed out while the others, led by Massa pitted. However, when all the stops were over, Massa was behind Nelson Piquet Jr. who had already pitted as he was on a one-stopper. Then, when a charging Hamilton came at him in the last 10 laps, Massa could not hold him off and subsequently finished third. After the race, Massa was four points behind Hamilton but three ahead of Räikkönen.

At the , the McLarens locked out the front row, and the best Massa could get was third. However, at the start itself, Massa passed both Heikki Kovalainen and pole sitter Hamilton on the run down to the first corner. He had the race in control from that point, and built up a five-second lead over Hamilton. When Hamilton suffered a puncture, Massa was left 20 seconds in front, but with three laps remaining he suffered an engine failure and retired.

The twelfth round of the season, the was in Valencia, Spain. Massa took pole position comfortably at this new circuit, and led from the start. However, during one of his pit stops he was released early and almost touched wheels with Adrian Sutil who was already coming down the pitlane. Massa won the race and also set the fastest lap. After the race, the stewards decided to fine Massa €10,000 for the incident with Sutil, but the victory stood and he was only 6 points behind Hamilton as well as being 7 ahead of Räikkönen. The race was Massa&#x27;s 100th Grand Prix entry.

The next race was Belgium, Massa qualified second behind Hamilton. He lost a place at the start to Räikkönen and stayed in third until lap 42 of 44 when Hamilton passed Räikkönen for the lead, just after cutting a chicane. The two had more battles throughout that lap, which resulted in the Finn crashing out, promoting Massa to second, despite the Brazilian dropping nine seconds on the last lap. Hamilton crossed the line first, but was penalised 25 seconds by the stewards after the race for cutting the chicane, and so the win went to Massa putting him only two points behind Hamilton.

At Italy, Ferrari&#x27;s home race, the weekend was wet throughout, and Massa qualified only sixth, but Hamilton was down in 15th. During the race, Massa got up to third, but dropped to sixth after he pitted once more than most others. He finished there, but as Hamilton only finished seventh, he narrowed Hamilton&#x27;s championship lead to a single point.

Massa took pole position for what was the first ever F1 night race and inaugural , beating Hamilton by six-tenths of a second. He maintained the lead at the start and after 14 laps, was over 5 seconds ahead of Hamilton. However, a crash for Nelson Piquet Jr. brought out the safety car, bunching up all the cars. It was then time for the first round of stops and during his stop Massa was given the green light to go, but the refueller was still refuelling the car. Massa left with the fuel rig attached and so had to stop at the end of the pitlane. The mechanics ran the length of the pitlane and finally removed the rig, but Massa was now last. He was then given a drive-through penalty for an unsafe release, and was 15 seconds behind the rest of the field. His race ruined, he finished 13th and Hamilton who finished third was now seven points ahead of him.

At the Massa qualified 5th on the grid, while Hamilton took pole position. At the start there was an incident between Hamilton and Räikkönen, dropping the former to sixth. Massa stayed fifth, a place in front of his rival. On the second lap, as Massa was stuck behind the slower car of Jarno Trulli, Hamilton tried to pass him. The result was a collision, with Hamilton spinning down to the back, and Massa dropping down to seventh. He was given a drive-through penalty for the incident, and found himself in 14th. He made a charge up the order, setting the fastest lap on his way to getting 8th and one point. This became seventh after a 25-second time penalty was issued to Sébastien Bourdais, who was judged by the stewards to have caused a collision with Massa whilst exiting the pitlane.

At the the following week Massa and teammate Räikkönen struggled for pace the entire weekend, a situation which Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali could not explain. Massa qualified third behind Räikkönen&#x27;s Ferrari and title rival Hamilton. Following the pattern of the weekend Massa struggled to keep up with Hamilton, who raced away and maintained a comfortable margin. Whilst he eventually found some speed after the graining period on the medium compound tyres, he was unable to catch Hamilton. As Räikkönen yielded second place to keep Massa&#x27;s title hopes alive, Hamilton pulled his lead out to seven points in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Massa remained optimistic stating &quot;For sure we are in a difficult position but we know many things can happen in one race&quot; and &quot;Always when you play at home you usually play better&quot;; in the previous two years he had taken a win and a second place at Interlagos. At the last race of the season, the , Massa was seven points behind Lewis Hamilton, meaning that Massa had to either finish first or second to win, and Hamilton had to be outside the top 5 – the same position Räikkönen had been in a year earlier, when he won the championship.

Massa qualified on pole, while Räikkönen qualified third, just ahead of Hamilton. There was a rain shower just before the start of the race, and all drivers started on intermediates. Massa maintained the lead, and after 10 laps everyone had to change to slicks on a drying track. Although the order was shuffled, Massa still led. He dominated the rest of the race, set the fastest lap and won by 13 seconds even though everyone had to change to intermediates after a late rain shower. Hamilton, meanwhile, struggled for pace. He was lying fourth for most of the race until the late shower, behind Massa, Alonso and Räikkönen. During the late shower, Timo Glock gambled on staying out on drys. He was fourth with Hamilton fifth. With three laps to go, Massa still led with Hamilton 5th, which would be enough for Hamilton to win the Championship. But Hamilton then made a mistake and was passed by Sebastian Vettel, demoting him to 6th and handing the Championship advantage to Massa. Massa secured the win, while Hamilton was still sixth as he came up to the second-to-last corner. He then passed Glock who had just been overtaken by Vettel and who was struggling for grip on his dry tyres, and so moved back into fifth place. This was enough to secure him the Drivers title by a single point. If he had tied points with Massa, by virtue of 6 victories to 5 in the season, Massa would have won the title.

Following the 2008 seasons F1.com called Massa &quot;no more the nearly man&quot;, saying &quot;No more the Ferrari number two, Massa is now a contender&quot;. His maturity was also praised by Ferrari President Luca di Montezemolo, commenting &quot;I can only imagine how painful that moment must have been for him. However, I would like to give him my very special compliments, not only for dominating the running out there on the track in front of his fans, proving he is worthy indeed of the world title, but also for his maturity and sportsmanship off the track. He&#x27;s a great champion and a great man.&quot;

====2009====

Felipe Massa gave Ferrari&#x27;s 2009 challenger – the F60 – its shakedown test at Mugello on 12 January 2009.

Ferrari confirmed that it would equip the F60 with KERS several days before the season opening . Friday practice session did not begin so well for Massa as he recorded the 7th and 10th fastest times. Saturday qualifying fared little better as he lined up 7th (although was promoted to 6th as Glock&#x27;s Toyota was disqualified). In the race the Ferrari&#x27;s poor ability to handle its tyres lead to their aggressive race strategy of super soft/medium/medium compounds paying little dividends after the first 6 laps (where the Ferraris moved to the front of the pack). Although Massa managed to stay in the top 3 for the first half of the race, the exceptionally quick graining of the super soft tyres forced him into a 3 stop strategy. Before he was able to complete the race a mechanical problem forced him to retire.
In Malaysia, an error of judgement by Ferrari meant that Massa failed to make it through the first session of qualifying. In an interview to Rede Globo, Massa revealed that he and the team believed that his initial time was quick enough to proceed into Q2, and refrained from recording further times in order to conserve the car&#x27;s engine. However, this was not the case, and Massa subsequently ended up in 16th for the race. In the race, Massa was classified as having finished in 9th, just outside the points-paying positions, after the race was abandoned on the 33rd lap due to torrential rain, poor light, and timing delays. Massa also failed to score in the next two races, retiring from the with electrical problems, and finishing well outside of the point scoring positions in 14th in Bahrain, due to a KERS problem and damaging his car&#x27;s front-wing on the first lap.

In Spain, Ferrari arrived with an upgraded car which attempted to fix many of the flaws present in the prior races. With the new aerodynamic parts, Massa managed to qualify in fourth place. He managed to maintain third position for a majority of the race before a computer issue showed the car as having less fuel than it should have, forcing him to conserve fuel in the final 10 laps, allowing Vettel and Alonso to cruise past, only for him to realise that the car had enough fuel for him not to need to conserve, after the race. The much upgraded car showed its pace by setting the third fastest time of the race after the two Brawns and in front of both Red Bull cars.

Monaco was another step in terms of improvement for the car as Massa finished fourth in the race, with fastest race lap. After qualifying a disappointing 8th, Massa produced a mistake free drive to net his first podium position of the season with a 3rd place at the at the Nürburgring. After making a great start to 4th place, he used his fuel strategy while defending from other drivers and looking after his tyres to take the final podium place.

====Injury====

On 25 July 2009, in the second round of qualifying for the , Massa&#x27;s head, though protected by his driver&#x27;s helmet, was struck by a suspension spring that had fallen from Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s Brawn, on a high-speed part of the track. He subsequently crashed head-on into a tyre barrier. Massa was airlifted to the ÁEK hospital in Budapest, where he underwent surgery in the area surrounding his left eye. His condition was initially described as &quot;life-threatening but stable&quot;, but improved rapidly. Massa was discharged from hospital the following week and returned to Brazil. After further tests it was decided Massa needed a titanium plate inserted into his skull to strengthen it for racing. Ferrari consultant and seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher was asked to take over Massa&#x27;s race seat during his recovery, but his comeback was prevented by neck injuries sustained during a motorcycle accident earlier in the year. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer was confirmed as Massa&#x27;s substitute for the European and Belgian Grands Prix. After two races in which Badoer failed to score a single point, on 3 September 2009 Ferrari announced that Massa&#x27;s place for the rest of the season would instead be taken by Giancarlo Fisichella who had signed a deal to be a Ferrari test driver for 2010 and had driven for Force India throughout the 2009 season.

As part of his return to Formula One Massa undertook a series of neurological examinations, co-ordinated by the FIA&#x27;s medical delegate, in Paris on 10 October 2009. The successful completion of these tests led to the announcement by Ferrari that Massa would, from 12 October 2009 be driving a 2007 Formula One car in order to continue re-acclimatising to racing. He waved the chequered flag at the 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix.

====2010====

Massa started the season with a second-place qualifying place, and a second-place finish in Bahrain behind teammate Fernando Alonso, despite having to save fuel in the last 22 laps.

At the , Massa was appointed a director of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association. Massa qualified fifth for the race, which was marked by changeable weather conditions and ten non-finishers. He finished third, largely managing to steer clear of the chaos. After the race, Massa commented cheerfully that it had been an unusually good start to the season for him. Third was his best ever finish at Melbourne. After a storming drive to 7th from 21st on the grid in Malaysia, he took the lead in the world championship. However, a disappointing ninth in China meant that he dropped back to sixth in the standings.

Massa qualified 9th in Spain, and finished the race 6th despite contact with Karun Chandhok which damaged his front wing. In Monaco, Massa was very quick during practice and qualified fourth. He got off to a great start and got alongside Robert Kubica, but had to yield the racing line at the first corner and finished the race in fourth, which promoted him to fifth in the championship with 61 points. The next race, the  – at which Massa has historically excelled – ended for him in a disappointing seventh, although he at least managed to out-qualify teammate Alonso and beat him in the race. Massa described the race as &quot;boring&quot;; he spent it battling with the Renaults of Kubica and Vitaly Petrov for the minor points positions. In Canada he qualified 7th and after an excellent start he spun Liuzzi 3 times and from there on had a poor race finishing 15th and a lap down. In Valencia, he qualified 5th, but after Mark Webber and Heikki Kovalainen collided and the safety car came out, he finished 11th and out of the points. In Silverstone, Massa qualified seventh, but on the first lap he developed a puncture after contact in the new section of the circuit. He ended up in a disappointing fifteenth, as the last car on the lead lap.

At the 2010 German Grand Prix Ferrari were investigated for team orders as Massa took the race lead early, ahead of Fernando Alonso in second and Sebastian Vettel close behind in third. During the race these positions were maintained until Massa received instructions from Ferrari engineer Rob Smedley, saying &quot;Fernando is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?&quot;. Shortly afterwards, on lap 49, Massa allowed Alonso to take the lead, and consequently to win the race. Smedley then added after the pass &#x27;Ok mate good lad, stick with him now, sorry.&#x27; The incident strongly suggested that a team order had been made to Massa to let Alonso overtake, and race stewards agreed. Despite team boss Stefano Domenicali&#x27;s denial, Ferrari were fined $100,000 for breaking Sporting Regulations and the matter was referred to the FIA World Motor Sport Council. Massa finished 4th in Hungary and Belgium and third in Italy. In Singapore, he qualified last due to a gearbox issue, but finished the race eighth. Massa collided with Vitantonio Liuzzi on the first lap of the Japanese Grand Prix but finished third in Korea. He finished a disappointing 15th in Brazil, and tenth in Abu Dhabi. Massa ended the season ranked sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

In June, Massa agreed to a contract extension until the end of the 2012 season.

====2011====

Massa remained with Scuderia Ferrari in , and again was partnered with Fernando Alonso. He drove his new car – the Ferrari 150º Italia – for the first time on 29 January 2011, undertaking a shakedown of the car at the Fiorano Circuit.

At the , Massa endured a poor start to the season at what has traditionally been his bogey race. Qualifying eighth, over 0.6 seconds behind teammate Alonso, Massa managed to get ahead of Alonso and several other drivers at the start and ran in fifth place for a while, much to the frustration of Jenson Button, who had a much quicker car but was unable to pass him. A lack of pace dropped Massa down the order to an eventual ninth-place finish, which became seventh after the Saubers of Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Pérez were disqualified.

The saw a better performance from Massa, who qualified seventh and showed greatly improved race pace, particularly on the soft Pirelli tyres. Massa again made a fine start to the race and ran ahead of Alonso until his first pit-stop. A problem with a tyre-change cost him time but he finished ahead of Alonso in fifth, after Alonso damaged his front wing against Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s right-rear tyre. In China, Massa improved again; at one point looking like challenging for the race win, before settling for sixth as Ferrari&#x27;s two-stop strategy did not suit the conditions. Despite this, he finished over fifteen seconds ahead of Alonso, and was pleased with his improved race performance. He finished 11th in Turkey after a slow pit stop, and retired in Spain due to a gearbox fault. In Monaco, Massa made contact with Lewis Hamilton at the hairpin on lap 32, and crashed in the tunnel a few corners later. While at the , on the last lap, he overtook Kamui Kobayashi just before the chequered flag to finish in sixth place. Three fifth places followed in Valencia, Silverstone – after a late-race battle with Hamilton – and at the where Red Bull&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel had a faster pit stop when they both pitted together on the penultimate lap, losing Massa fourth place. Massa added a sixth-place finish in Hungary.

Massa out-qualified Alonso for only the second time in , in Belgium; but he fell from fourth to eighth in the race. Massa took another sixth-place finish at the , after he was spun round by Webber on lap five. Hamilton made contact with Massa for the third time in 2011, when attempting to overtake him for eighth in the . Hamilton punctured Massa&#x27;s right-rear tyre with his front wing, an incident for which Hamilton received a drive-through penalty. This followed an incident in qualifying where Hamilton lunged down Massa&#x27;s inside, attempting to pass on an out-lap, which led Massa to publicly criticise Hamilton. Massa also went up to Hamilton in the post-race TV interview area as he was about to start an interview with RTL Television, patted his shoulder, and sarcastically said: &quot;Good job, bro.&quot; It was later reported that during the race Massa&#x27;s engineer Rob Smedley sent a radio message to Massa stating &quot;Hold Hamilton as much as we can. Destroy his race as much as we can. Come on, boy...&quot; Hamilton and Massa collided at the next race in Japan, damaging Massa&#x27;s front wing endplate, but he eventually finished in seventh place. After the race, Massa called for the FIA to take action on Hamilton. After finishing sixth at the , he crashed in qualifying for the Indian Grand Prix after he broke his suspension on a kerb and then hit the barriers. In the race, he once again collided with Hamilton on the 24th lap of the , for the fifth time this season, this time however with Massa being awarded a drive-through penalty. He retired later after hitting a kerb too hard, the same fate which ended his qualifying session. He rounded off the year with two fifth-place finishes in Abu Dhabi and Brazil.

====2012====
Despite his disappointing 2011, Massa remained with Ferrari for 2012. At the , Massa qualified 16th – a second behind teammate Alonso, who qualified twelfth – for his worst qualifying result since the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix, and the first time he qualified outside the top ten since the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix. Massa gained six places on the first lap, running as high as eighth in the early stages of the race, but suffered badly from tyre degradation and fell down the order before retiring from the race after a collision with Williams driver Bruno Senna; both drivers later agreed that it was a racing incident. In the , Massa qualified 12th and finished 15th, 1-minute 37 seconds behind his teammate Fernando Alonso, who won the race. This result put Massa 19th in the Championship, whilst teammate Alonso was leading on 35 points. Sauber&#x27;s Sergio Pérez finished 2nd and there has been speculation linking Pérez to Massa&#x27;s seat. Massa was thirteenth at the before he scored his first points of the season with ninth at the . In Spain, Massa started sixteenth and finished fifteenth whilst teammate Alonso started and finished second, he also had a drive-through for ignoring yellow flags. He finished 6th in Monaco, and tenth in Canada, after spinning in the early stages of the race.

He finished 16th in Valencia, after Kobayashi made contact with him at the restart. A great weekend followed in Silverstone, as he qualified 5th and finished 4th, despite Alonso&#x27;s pole and second place. Massa finished 12th in Hockenheim, where he hit Daniel Ricciardo on the first lap and as a result, removed his own front wing. Massa added a ninth-place finish in Hungary. After qualifying 14th at Spa, Massa finished 5th in the race, earning 10 points and climbing to eleventh position in the driver standings, with the same points as Michael Schumacher. Massa took his best qualifying result of the season so far and got third place grid position at Monza. After a great start he made his way up to second position but finished the race in fourth after being passed by Alonso and Pérez in the closing laps. In Suzuka, Massa qualified 11th, but started 10th due to a gearbox penalty for Nico Hülkenberg. He made a great start after his teammate Alonso retired at the first corner of the first lap, and went on to finish in 2nd position, his first podium since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix. Massa qualified 6th for the 2012 Korean Grand Prix. He maintained 6th position after the first corner, and overtook Räikkönen on the first lap. After a few laps he also made a move on Lewis Hamilton, giving him 4th position. He had great pace throughout, with the possibility to overtake Alonso and even Webber, but because Alonso is fighting for the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Massa was told to hold station. On 16 October 2012, Massa signed a 1-year contract with Ferrari. This came as a result of an impressive string of results for the Scuderia, and means that Massa is under contract to race with Ferrari until the end of 2013. In India, Massa qualified 6th and finished 6th, despite having to save fuel and being hounded by Räikkönen the whole race. In Abu Dhabi, Massa qualified 9th but started on the grid in 8th as a result of Vettel&#x27;s penalty. He ran as high as 7th until he spun when fighting with Mark Webber, but drove well and worked his way up to 7th again. At the US Grand Prix, Massa outqualified teammate Alonso for only the second time this year. But then Ferrari tactically broke his gearbox seal to move Alonso onto the clean side of the grid. This demoted Massa to 11th but he drove a storming race to finish 4th. At the final race of the season in Brazil, Massa again outqualified teammate Alonso for the second straight race to start 5th. At the start of the race Massa made his way up into 2nd place, only to fall down to 11th after some bad strategical decisions with the ever-changing weather conditions at Interlagos. Then thanks to a safety car, the field bunched up and Massa made his way through the field into 2nd but had to yield to title-chasing teammate Alonso. Eventually Massa finished 3rd on the podium in front of his home crowd to end a good second half of the season for him.

====2013====
Massa started his season strongly with the new F138 at the . He qualified fourth, one place ahead of teammate Alonso. He was able to stay very competitive, especially during the early laps of the race but finished the race in fourth place, two places behind Alonso. At the following race in Malaysia, Massa started on the front row of the grid, out-qualifying Alonso for the fourth time in a row. Massa had a poor start and bad first stint on the intermediate tyres resulting him falling down the order, but as the track dried out, he recovered places on the slick tyres and finished fifth. Three weeks later at the Chinese Grand Prix Massa qualified fifth, beaten by his teammate, who qualified third, for the first time in 5 races. In the race Massa got up to second place before the first round of pitstops, but he pitted a lap later than the other leaders, so he fell back down the order, so despite the early pace that he showed, only managed to finish sixth. At the next race in Bahrain, Massa qualified 6th but moved up to 4th alongside his teammate due to penalties for Webber and Hamilton. Massa was the only car in Q3 to qualify on the hard tyres indicating he was on a different strategy. In the race, the strategy gamble did not pay off as he did not run as far as he wanted and needed before the first stop. Along with two punctures in the race, this resulted in Massa finishing 15th. In Spain, Massa received a three-place grid penalty for blocking Mark Webber in qualifying, and started 9th. He made an excellent start, coming up to 6th, and then leapfrogged more cars during the pitstops, eventually finishing 3rd. His first podium of the year situated him 5th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

In Monaco Massa suffered a heavy crash during 3rd Practice on Saturday into St Devote corner. He was driving down the main straight at almost 180 mph when his brakes locked and he slid into the barrier on the left hand side of the track. He lost control of the car and bounced off the wall ending up with a face on crash into the tyre wall ahead. He was unhurt by the accident but the car was badly damaged and Massa was unable to take part in Qualifying later in the day. Ferrari engineers initially believed the crash to be attributable to driver error. Starting the race from 21st on the grid, Massa slowly made up ground before crashing again into St Devote in an almost identical accident. After the crash Massa was taken to hospital in Monte Carlo but escaped with only minor injuries. This second incident caused Ferrari to investigate further, concluding that suspension failure, not driver error, was ultimately to blame. Massa scored an 8th place in Canada, and a 6th place in Britain. In Germany, he had a good start, jumping to 6th place, before spinning out on lap 3 with gearbox failure. In the Hungarian race, he struggled with an uncompetitive Ferrari, qualifying 7th and finishing 8th.

In Belgium Massa looked to be heading for his 1st pole position since the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix when he set the fastest time in wet conditions at the beginning of Q3 but the track dried and Ferrari had decided to leave Massa in the garage as they thought his time was good enough for pole so he dropped back to 10th, one place behind teammate Alonso. In the race Massa finished 7th behind Alonso who finished 2nd. In Ferrari&#x27;s home race in Italy Massa qualified 4th, one place ahead of his teammate. He then jumped Red Bull&#x27;s Mark Webber and Sauber&#x27;s Nico Hülkenberg who qualified in a brilliant 3rd when the best he had managed all season was 10th in a slow car. Hülkenberg was one of the drivers who was in a chance of taking Massa&#x27;s seat in 2014. Despite Massa&#x27;s great start he moved over for Alonso who was race leader Sebastian Vettel&#x27;s closest championship rival. Massa dropped to fourth in the pit stop phase after staying out longer than Alonso and Webber, but he fought back to challenge them for a podium, ultimately finishing in fourth place.

On 10 September 2013, Massa confirmed that he would be leaving Ferrari at the end of the season on Instagram and Twitter. The following day, it was announced that Massa&#x27;s former teammate, Kimi Räikkönen, would be his replacement at Ferrari.

===Williams (2014–2017)===

====2014====

On 11 November 2013, Williams announced that Massa would partner Valtteri Bottas for the season replacing Pastor Maldonado.

He suffered an unlucky start to his campaign in Australia, when he retired after being hit hard by Kamui Kobayashi&#x27;s Caterham. The string of bad luck continued in Malaysia after a team orders debacle, being caught out by the safety car in Bahrain, a botched pitstop in China and a collision with Sergio Pérez in Canada. However, at the , he took his first pole position since the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix and finished fourth. But the next two races, in Britain and Germany, resulted in first lap race-ending collisions with former Ferrari teammate Räikkönen and Kevin Magnussen respectively.

On 7 September 2014 it was confirmed that Massa, along with Bottas, would stay at Williams for . On the same day, he scored his first podium for Williams, finishing third in the .

On 9 November 2014 Massa took his second podium for Williams at the as he finished third behind second placed Lewis Hamilton and winner Nico Rosberg. Massa ended Williams&#x27;s competitive season on a high with what he described as his &quot;best race of the year&quot; at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. Although qualifying in fourth – one place behind teammate Bottas – he showed good pace in the whole weekend and finished a strong second after Rosberg&#x27;s subsequent power-unit problems, even making a late but convincing challenge on race leader Hamilton in the final third of the race.

====2015====

Massa&#x27;s season started strongly, with a fourth-place finish in Australia. After some further strong results in Malaysia and China, Massa had troubles in the next stage of the season. He suffered from mechanical issues both on the grid in Bahrain and in qualifying in Canada, meaning he had to fight from towards the back on each occasion, albeit eventually finishing both races in the points.

In Austria, Massa took his first podium of the year, a third-place finish, taking advantage of a delayed pitstop for Vettel. It was the fortieth podium of his career. Massa qualified third for the but started well and jumped to first leading the early stages of the race. However, he could only finish fourth after being jumped by both Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel during the pit stops.

In Hungary, the race did not start well for Massa, as he was handed a 5-second stop and go penalty for being outside of the lines on the grid. In the end, Massa finished only twelfth, with his teammate right behind him. After a long summer break, the action returned to Belgium, where Williams seemed to be really quick. In qualifying, Massa achieved sixth position, which he maintained for the race, after some tyre issues in the first stint.

In the next round at Monza, Massa qualified fifth, but he made a good start to take third until the first round of pit stops, when he lost a place to the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. After Rosberg&#x27;s retirement on lap 51, Massa fought really hard to maintain the last podium spot, which he achieved. It was his second podium of the year, but it was a very emotional podium, in front of the tifosi.

In Singapore, Massa was running in eighth position until the first round of pitstops. On lap 13 and after a slow pitstop, Massa exited the pit lane and collided with Force India&#x27;s driver Nico Hülkenberg. The incident was examined by the stewards. They eventually handed Hülkenberg a drop of three places for the next race. Massa suffered from gearbox problems and retired on lap 30.

The next race, in Japan, started well for Massa after qualifying a solid 5th in between the Ferrari pair. The race however was basically over before it even began as Massa collided with Daniel Ricciardo and caused a first corner puncture for both drivers, with Massa finishing 17th and 2 laps down, with the race resulting in Massa dropping ground in the championship fight for 4th place between himself, Bottas and Räikkönen.

The Russian Grand Prix, was a contrast in fortune for Massa. After a poor qualifying due to traffic he was only able to start 15th on the grid, due to failures from other cars and a last lap collision between his teammate Bottas and Räikkönen in a battle for the final podium position, Massa was able to cross the finish line a solid 4th place just behind the Force India of Sergio Pérez in 3rd.

In the following race, in Austin, torrential rain hit the race weekend and Massa qualified ninth. At the start, he spun and collided with his former teammate Fernando Alonso, before retiring due to a gearbox damper failure. The next race saw the return of the Mexican Grand Prix to the calendar after 23 years. Massa qualified seventh and in the race he finished sixth.

In his home event, in Brazil, Massa struggled the whole weekend with his car balance. Despite his setup problems, he qualified and finished the race in eighth position, before being disqualified from the race results as the stewards found that his right-rear tyre did not comply with the maximum permitted temperature ahead of the start of the race. In the last round of the season, in Abu Dhabi, Massa qualified in eighth. After a late overtake on Red Bull Racing driver Daniil Kvyat he finished his campaign in eighth position. He finished the season in sixth place in the drivers&#x27; standings, achieving two podiums in Austria and in Italy.

====2016====

The season started well for Massa; after qualifying in a solid sixth place for the first race of the season in Australia, he drove a lonely race to finish fifth, collecting 10 points. In the second round of the season, in Bahrain, Massa qualified in seventh, 0.002 seconds behind his teammate. After an excellent start, Massa climbed up to second until the first round of pit stops, which saw Williams followed a conservative 2-stop strategy, using the medium compound. The strategy did not work out, and Massa finished the race in eighth, after being overtaken on the last lap by Red Bull Racing driver Daniil Kvyat.

The next round, the 2016 Chinese Grand Prix, saw Massa qualifying a disappointing eleventh, after a red flag prevented Massa from having a final run in Q2. In the race, Massa followed a two stop strategy, which helped him finish in a solid sixth place, after a long fight with Lewis Hamilton. Round 4, the Russian Grand Prix, saw Massa qualifying in fifth place, but he was promoted to fourth after Scuderia Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel was given a five-place grid penalty after changing his gearbox. In the race, Massa stayed out of trouble on the first lap, and drove a quiet race to finish a solid fifth.

At round 5 of the season, the Spanish Grand Prix, Massa was knocked out in Q1, after losing time with traffic during his first run, and then failing to have enough time to go out again for a second run. It was the first time since Russia in 2014 that Massa was knocked out in Q1. In the race, Massa made solid progress, to finish in eighth after utilising an aggressive 3 stop strategy. The sixth event of the 2016 championship, the Monaco Grand Prix, did not start well for Massa as he crashed at Saint Devote in first practice. On Saturday he qualified in P14, but in a race that begun in wet conditions, Massa progressed to finish tenth and score one point, becoming the only driver at that point in the season to have scored points in every race.

At the next race, the Canadian Grand Prix, the race weekend did not start well for Massa, as he crashed in the first practice session, in turn 1. The DRS did not close under braking, leaving Massa with a lack of rear downforce under braking, which led to the crash. Massa had to run the remainder of the weekend missing some parts after the crash in free practice one. He qualified on the fourth row, in eighth place. In the race, Massa had to retire due to a water leak which resulted in an overheated engine. One week later, at the European Grand Prix, the first Formula One race to be held in Azerbaijan, Massa struggled during the practice sessions, but managed to qualify sixth. In the race, he suffered from rear tyre graining and finished in tenth place.

In the following 4 races, Massa failed to score any points, as most of his races were compromised by bad luck. In Austria, Massa had to start from the pitlane due to a front wing change following structural damage sustained in qualifying. In the race, and despite his pitlane start, Massa had climbed into the points before he was forced to retire with high brake temperatures on lap 63. At the next race, the , Massa started outside the top 10. His race was compromised even before the start, as torrential rain hit the circuit. The Williams car historically did not suit the wet weather conditions, and despite his infallible drive in those treacherous mixed conditions, Massa finished in eleventh, just outside the points. In the following race, in Hungary, Massa struggled throughout the race weekend. In the wet weather qualifying, Massa qualified a disappointing eighteenth. As the track began to dry, Massa switched to the intermediates, but aquaplaned at Turn 4 and made heavy contact with the barrier, which brought his session to an end. In the race, Massa finished in eighteenth. Massa encountered steering rack issues on the way to the grid, with the steering wheel rack being too light on one side and too heavy on the other. The Williams crew worked hard to try and fix it before the start of the race. The issue was improved to a degree that Massa was able to race the car, but he was extremely compromised.

The last race before the summer break was held in Germany. Massa qualified in tenth. His race though, was compromised when he was clipped on the opening lap by Palmer&#x27;s Renault which affected his car&#x27;s pace. The issue could not be identified or resolved during the race, therefore he was forced to retire on lap 36. Next, in Belgium, Massa qualified in tenth, as he could do only one run in Q3. In his only effort, Massa locked up his tyres heading to turn 1 and his lap was compromised. At the start of the race, he managed to stay out of trouble and climbed up to fourth, but he could not keep the tyres in good shape and finished in tenth.

On 1 September 2016, Massa announced that he would retire from Formula One at the end of the season.

After announcing his retirement from Formula 1 after 15 years, Massa qualified eleventh for the Italian Grand Prix. After an aggressive start, which saw him overtake 3 cars, Massa finished his last Italian race in ninth. After a two-week break, the action returned to Singapore. In qualifying, Massa was caught by yellow flags, caused by Romain Grosjean and Jenson Button. He finished in P12, but he was promoted to P11 after Sergio Pérez was penalised for improving his time in Q2 under yellow flag conditions. In the race, Massa followed an unsuccessful 3 stop strategy, and despite running in the top 10 for the majority of the race, he finished in twelfth.

At the Malaysian Grand Prix, his whole race was compromised by extremely bad luck. Massa suffered a throttle issue, leaving him stranded on the grid as the formation lap started. The team were able to get the car going to enable him to start from the pitlane. However, just a couple of laps later he picked up a slow puncture and had to pit again. Massa was then down in 19th but drove a strong race to fight back to 13th at the finish. Next, in Japan, Williams decided to do a single effort in Q2, which saw Massa qualifying in twelfth. In the race, Massa lost 2 places at the start, from the Toro Rosso drivers, as he started on the medium tyres. After following a one stop strategy, Massa finished in ninth, just in front of his teammate. At the following race, in Austin, Massa qualified in ninth. In the race, Massa had an excellent start, gaining two positions at the first corner and running in sixth place. However, a virtual safety car was deployed due to Max Verstappen&#x27;s retirement allowing Carlos Sainz Jr an advantage to move ahead into fifth place. In the final stint, in a battle for fifth, Massa and Fernando Alonso came together to Massa&#x27;s detriment, dropping him to seventh and causing a puncture which resulted in a pitstop on the penultimate lap. The incident was investigated by the stewards, but no action was taken. Massa was able to maintain track position and finish the race in seventh, ahead of Sergio Pérez. This was the best result for Massa since the Russian Grand Prix.

In the next race, in Mexico, Massa qualified ninth. In the race, Massa made a strong start, going from ninth to sixth in the opening laps, and pitted for the medium tyre on lap 14. He ran in ninth for the majority of the race on the medium tyre, holding off a chasing Pérez who had newer medium tyres and DRS for much of the race.

In Brazil, Massa qualified thirteenth, as the cold conditions did not help him. In the wet race, Massa was making good progress in the treacherous conditions until he crashed out of what was expected to be at the time his last home Grand Prix on lap 47, prompting emotional scenes as he was cheered by fans whilst being given a guard of honour by other teams as he walked back down the pitlane.

====2017====

On 16 January 2017, Massa rejoined Williams after Valtteri Bottas signed with Mercedes. In the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix, Massa qualified in seventh and finished in sixth. In China, he qualified in sixth. In the race, he struggled with the changing conditions to finish in 14th. Next, in Bahrain, Massa qualified in eighth and finished a strong sixth. In Russia, he qualified in sixth. In the race, he suffered 2 punctures and finished in ninth. Moving on to Spain, Massa qualified in ninth. In the race, he made a good start but made contact with McLaren driver Fernando Alonso and suffered a puncture. As a result, he finished out of the points, in 13th. In Monaco, Massa qualified only in 15th, as he was caught by yellow flags caused by Stoffel Vandoorne. In the race, he kept out of trouble to finish in ninth, collecting 2 points.
In Montreal, Massa qualified a solid 7th. His race was short lived, as he was taken out by a spinning Carlos Sainz Jr. at turn 3.
Two weeks later in Azerbaijan, Massa qualified in 9th behind his teammate Lance Stroll for the first time that season and ahead of the eventual race winner Daniel Ricciardo. In the race, Massa had a good start, avoiding the turn 2 collision between Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, climbing up to sixth. Massa showed good pace throughout the race and managed to climb up to third passing both Kimi Räikkönen and Sergio Pérez during the safety car restarts and almost pulled off a sublime move on Sebastian Vettel for second place, before the race was red-flagged due to large amounts of debris around the track. When the race restarted, Massa suffered from a broken rear damper and had to retire from the race on lap 25, a race both Williams Chief Technical Officer Paddy Lowe and Massa himself believed he could have won.

Massa recovered well at the next two races in Austria and Britain to finish both races in the points with a 9th and 10th-place finish respectively.

After missing the Hungarian Grand Prix due to illness, Massa returned for the Belgian Grand Prix to claim 8th place, a result he then repeated in Italy one week later. Poor strategy calls in Singapore left Massa languishing in 11th place by the finish. Points were to come at the next 3 races for Massa as he finished 9th in Malaysia, 10th in Japan and 9th in the United States Grand Prix.

On 4 November he announced for the second time that he would retire from Formula One, at the end of the 2017 season.

At the Brazilian Grand Prix, his home race, he finished a strong 7th after overtaking Fernando Alonso on the fifth lap for 5th place but lost out to Daniel Ricciardo and Lewis Hamilton who were coming through the field.

2017 was a difficult year for Williams as a whole due to a lack of downforce (affecting tyre wear to an extent) from the car in addition to poor wet weather drivability as shown in races such as China where Massa started 6th but finished outside of the points. Williams began with a superior car to the midfield teams such as Force India but fell behind in the development race midseason.

== Formula E ==

In April 2018 it was announced that Massa would be taking part in Formula E racing for Venturi Grand Prix for 3 years starting with the 2018–19 Formula E season. On the final day of the 2019–20 season, Massa opted not to exercise the option in his contract to stay with Venturi for the 2020–21 Formula E season and left Formula E altogether.

== Porsche GT3 Cup Brasil ==
One month after his retirement from Formula E, Massa participated in the Porsche GT3 Cup Brasil endurance series, sharing a car with 2016 champion Lico Kaesemodel. They managed to finish in third position.

== Stock Car Pro Series ==
After ending his full time participation in Formula E, Massa returned to his homeland Brazil, where he competed full time in Stock Car Pro Series with the Lubrax Podium team. After some struggles in the first 2 seasons, Massa&#x27;s performances started to improve drastically during the 2023 Stock Car Pro Series. After a couple of podiums in Interlagos and Autódromo Velo Città, Massa got his first race win since the 2008 Formula One World Championship season finale, at Autódromo Internacional de Cascavel.

==Personal life==

Felipe Massa married Anna Raffaela Bassi on 30 November 2007, in São Paulo, Brazil. The couple&#x27;s first son, Felipinho (Bassi Massa), was born on 30 November 2009.

Massa is a friend of Swiss watchmaker Richard Mille, who has dedicated several models of his watches to him (RM-005FM, RM-011).

Nicolas Todt, son of Ferrari&#x27;s past team principal and former FIA president Jean Todt, is Massa&#x27;s manager.

Though Massa supports Brazilian football team São Paulo FC, he also supports the Turkish football team Fenerbahçe that was formerly coached by Zico. On 24 August 2007, Massa said: &quot;Zico was my childhood idol, Roberto Carlos is my best friend. I am a Fenerbahçe fan, because it is just like a Brazilian team. I love Turkey, as I won my first championship race in Turkey, it has special value for me.&quot;

Massa held a charity kart race, &quot;Desafio Internacional das Estrelas&quot; (International Challenge of the Stars) every year between 2005 and 2014. Notably, many active top level Brazilian drivers have competed in the event, such as Formula One drivers Rubens Barrichello and Nelson Piquet Jr., drivers who competed in American open wheel events such as Tony Kanaan, Mario Moraes, Felipe Giaffone, Vítor Meira, Roberto Moreno, and Gil de Ferran, and Stock Car Brasil champion Cacá Bueno. In addition, Brazilian motorcycle racer Alex Barros has competed. Michael Schumacher and Luca Badoer joined the Brazilian contingent in 2007. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Jeff Gordon and Jaime Alguersuari have also participated.

Massa was the president of the Commission Internationale de Karting from December 2017 until 2022, when he became the president of the FIA Drivers&#x27; Commission.

On 18 September 2012, Massa participated on a world record event at Silverstone where 964 Ferrari cars, 36 shy of their target of 1000, assembled together on the track. This spectacle was witnessed by 25,000 fans which features Massa&#x27;s 2008 car driven by Ferrari test driver Marc Gené.

Massa has a strong Catholic faith.

===Legal actions over 2008 F1 title===
In March 2023, in an interview with German website &quot;F1-Insider&quot;, former Formula One Group chief executive Bernie Ecclestone was quoted saying that both he and then-FIA president Max Mosley were made aware of Renault&#x27;s deliberate manipulation of the Singapore Grand Prix &quot;during the 2008 season&quot;. He added: &quot;We had enough information in time to investigate the matter. According to the statutes, we should have cancelled the race in Singapore under these conditions. That means it would never have happened for the championship standings. And then Felipe Massa would have become world champion and not Lewis Hamilton.&quot; Despite this, Ecclestone said they decided not to act in order to &quot;protect the sport and save it from a huge scandal&quot;. Following Ecclestone&#x27;s comments, Massa reportedly started investigating whether he could take legal action to challenge the outcome of the 2008 championship. In August, Massa and his legal team sent a Letter Before Claim to the FIA and FOM.

==Helmet==

Massa&#x27;s helmet was blue with a fluorescent yellow X on the sides and a yellow triangle that covers the upper helmet with the top section coloured with a green gradient (prior to F1, this section was blue), in Ferrari early years until 2010, Massa&#x27;s helmet featured also a white ring surrounding the top. In 2008 the tips of the fluoro yellow X were more ramified. In 2011 on the yellow triangle covered the entire upper front with 2 blue lines in the sides. For his 100th race with Ferrari at the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, Massa sported a chrome and gold prancing horse on the top with a further 100 horses representing the races Massa contested with Ferrari. The design also featured gold, blue and green spreading out over the helmet.

<doc id="647266" wikidata="Q1457365" url="?curid=647266" title="X-ray (chess)">
<text>In chess, an X-ray or X-ray attack is a tactic where a indirectly controls a square from the other side of an intervening piece. Generally, a piece performing an X-ray either:
* effects a skewer,
* indirectly attacks an enemy piece through another piece or pieces, or
* defends a friendly piece through an enemy piece.
==Examples==

The second usage is seen in the first diagram position, which arises from the Black Knights&#x27; Tango opening after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e6 4.a3 d6 5.Nc3 g6 6.e4 Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 Re8 9.Be3 e5 10.d5 Nd4 Authors Richard Palliser and Georgi Orlov, in their respective books on that opening, both note that Black&#x27;s rook on e8 &quot;X-rays&quot; White&#x27;s e-pawn through Black&#x27;s own pawn on e5. If 11.Nxd4 exd4 12.Bxd4 Nxe4 13.Nxe4 Rxe4. The identical position is reached, except that White has not played a2–a3, in the King&#x27;s Indian Defense after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 0-0 6. Be2 e5 7.0-0 Nc6 8.Be3 Re8 9.d5 Nd4!

Of the second diagram position, arising from the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian Defense, Atanas Kolev and Trajko Nedev observe, &quot;On f1 the king is X-rayed by the f8-rook&quot;. They analyze the possible continuation 22...f5 23.exf5 Bxf5 24.Nxf5 Rxf5 25.Qg4 Bg5 (exploiting the pin along the f-file) 26.Kg2 Bxf4 27.Nxf4 Rg5 28.Nxg6+ Kg7 and White resigned in Delchev–Kotanjian, Kusadasi 2006.

The first diagram position arose after 23...Qd8–h4! in Krasenkow–Seirawan, 34th Chess Olympiad, Istanbul 2000. Michael Rohde writes of Seirawan&#x27;s 23rd move, &quot;Holding things up through an x-ray on the pawn on d4.&quot; Black would respond to either 24.e5 or 24.exd5 with 24...Qxd4+.

Gerald Abrahams alludes to the X-ray concept, without using that term, when he cites the aphorism, &quot;Put your rook on the line of his queen, no matter how many other pieces intervene.&quot; He writes, &quot;That doggerel jingle incorporates some experience&quot;. A future world champion played in that manner in Rauzer–Botvinnik, USSR Championship 1933. Two moves before the second diagram position arose, Botvinnik had played 13...Rfd8, X-raying the white queen through the pawn on d6. Now Bernard Cafferty and Mark Taimanov suggest &quot;15.Qf2 to get away from the &#x27;X-ray&#x27; attack from the d8 rook&quot;. Instead, the game continued 15.Rac1 e5! 16.b3 d5, exploiting the queen&#x27;s position on the same file as the rook and leading to a win for Botvinnik 13 moves later.

The first diagram position arose from the English Opening in the famous Petrosian–Ree, Wijk aan Zee 1971 after 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.g3 Bb4 5.Nd5 Nxd5 6.cxd5 e4 7.dxc6 exf3 8.Qb3! Author Iakov Neishtadt cites the game as an example of an &quot;X-ray&quot;. Black resigned because the white queen&#x27;s X-ray of his pawn on b7, through Black&#x27;s bishop on b4, wins a piece after, e.g., 8...a5 (or 8...Qe7) 9.a3 Bc5 10.cxb7.

The above examples all involve a latent attack along a or . A latent attack along a diagonal has also been called an X-ray. The second diagram position arose in Dorfman–Tseshkovsky, 46th USSR Championship Tbilisi 1978. Cafferty and Taimanov write, &quot;Black can use the &#x27;X-ray&#x27; attack of his queen on the enemy king to break up the white bastions&quot;. Black exploited the X-ray along the b8–h2 diagonal and won quickly after 48...g5! 49.hxg5 h4! with a decisive attack. The game concluded 50.g6 Kxg6 51.Qa6+ Kg5 52.gxh4+ Kxf4 53.Qc4+ Ke3+ 54.Kh3 Kf2+ 55.Qxb3 Nxg5+! and White resigned in light of 56.hxg5 Qh8#.

The third usage is given by the American master and writer Bruce Pandolfini, who states that one usage of &quot;X-Ray&quot; is &quot;a skewer defense along a rank, file, or diagonal&quot; that &quot;protects a friendly man through an enemy man in the middle along the same line of power&quot;. Jeremy Silman uses the term in the same way, illustrating &quot;X-ray&quot; with the two diagrams. In the first diagram position, White wins with the X-ray 1.Qxd8+! followed by 1...Rxd8 2.Rxd8+ (note how White&#x27;s rook defended his queen through the black rook on d5) Qxd8 3.Rxd8# or 1...Qxd8 2.Rxd5 Qf8 3.Rd8 and wins. In the second diagram position, White wins a pawn with 1.Nxb7!, when White&#x27;s bishop on f3 defends the white knight on b7 through Black&#x27;s bishop on d5. Silman states that the X-ray &quot;takes advantage of pieces that appear to be adequately defended but really aren&#x27;t&quot;.

Raymond Keene also uses the term in this way in analyzing Fischer–Bisguier, New York 1957. Discussing a possible variation that could have arisen in that game (see first diagram position), Keene writes that 28.Qxg5 (when the white queen defends against 28...Qxg2# through Black&#x27;s queen on g4) &quot;defends the mate—an &#x27;X-ray motif&#x27;, as Fischer once described it&quot;.

In Euwe–Loman, Rotterdam 1923 (second diagram position), White forced mate with 17.Qh8+! Bxh8 18.Rxh8#. Neishtadt writes of 17.Qh8+, &quot;The X-ray! The bishop at b2 attacks the square h8 &#x27;through&#x27; the enemy bishop.&quot;

<text>Christian Klien (born 7 February 1983) is an Austrian racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and .

Born and raised in Hohenems, Klien competed in Formula One for Jaguar, Red Bull and HRT, scoring 14 championship points across 51 Grands Prix.

==Racing career==
Born in Hohenems, Klien started his motorsport career in his early teens. He raced in karting championships in both Austria and Switzerland, before moving to Formula BMW. After winning several titles in lower Formulas, Klien moved into Formula One, driving for the Jaguar Racing team, alongside Mark Webber. At the end of 2004, however, Jaguar sold its Formula One team to Red Bull, which renamed it &quot;Red Bull Racing&quot;. In an unusual arrangement, Klien shared a race seat with Italian Vitantonio Liuzzi. He stayed at Red Bull for 2006, whilst Liuzzi moved to the Red Bull junior team, Scuderia Toro Rosso.

After an unsuccessful 2006, Klien&#x27;s old teammate Mark Webber replaced him for the 2007 season, news Klien learned from Webber himself. Klien was offered alternatives to Formula One for 2007, including driving in the ChampCar series, but he refused and aimed for a seat in Formula One. He secured the test driver&#x27;s seat at Honda, despite competition from other drivers, including Gary Paffett.

On 2 February 2008 Klien signed as BMW Sauber&#x27;s reserve and test driver for the 2008 Formula One season, alongside Estonian Marko Asmer.

===Pre-Formula One===
Klien became enthused about racing when his dad brought him to watch a go-kart race. This enthusiasm for the sport was only increased after meeting Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna. The Austrian started his career at the age of 13. From 1996 to 1998, Klien won several kart races in both Switzerland and his native Austria, becoming the Suisse champion in his first year.

In 1999, Klien moved to racing in the Formula BMW ADAC Junior Cup, winning four races and finishing fourth in the series. The following year, he moved into the main Formula BMW ADAC Championship with Team Rosberg, finishing the series ranked tenth overall and third in the rookie rankings. Continuing in the series in 2001, Klien managed to win five races, and ended up third in the series. Joining JD Motorsport for the Italian winter Formula Renault series, he won one event, which led to a drive for the team in German Formula Renault for 2002.

Klien won four races, winning the German title, and finishing fifth in the European series. From there, Klien moved into the Formula Three Euroseries, with Mücke Motorsport, winning four races and finishing runner-up to Ryan Briscoe. Klien also won the 2003 Marlboro Masters event at Zandvoort.

===Formula One===

====Jaguar (2004)====

In December 2003, Klien was signed as a race driver for the Jaguar Formula One team for the 2004 season, replacing Justin Wilson, who had replaced Antônio Pizzonia for the final five Grands Prix of the 2003 season. He had significant pressure on him as second driver to his more experienced teammate Mark Webber, but was the first driver to ever outqualify Webber from the same team.

Klien proved to be considerably reliable over the season, retiring only on four occasions out of the possible 18. Klien&#x27;s only points scoring finish in his debut season came in Belgium, where Klien finished sixth; scoring three Championship points. He finished alongside Cristiano da Matta and Nick Heidfeld in joint 16th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

====Red Bull (2005–2006)====

;2005
Jaguar were bought out in November 2004 by Austrian energy drink company Red Bull and were renamed Red Bull Racing. During winter testing in 2005, Klien tested several times for Red Bull Racing alongside Vitantonio Liuzzi and David Coulthard. Klien secured the second race seat at Red Bull, alongside Coulthard. Klien started the year with points finishes in the first two races before retiring in Bahrain before the race had even started due to an electrical problem.

With both Klien and Liuzzi signed to race for the Red Bull team in 2005, Red Bull announced that Liuzzi would be racing at the next four rounds in San Marino, Spain, Monaco and the European Grands Prix instead of Klien. Originally, Klien was ineligible to be a third driver at these Grand Prix, as he had competed in over six Grand Prix the previous year, but after a majority of teams asked the FIA to remove this ruling, Klien was allowed to take this role at Imola.

The Austrian returned to the race seat for the Canadian Grand Prix and maintained his race seat thanks to his strong performances and Red Bull&#x27;s increased number of seats from the purchase of the Minardi team (which was renamed Scuderia Toro Rosso, Italian for &quot;Team Red Bull&quot;) in 2006. Klien finished his second year in Formula One with two further points finishes: an eighth-place finish in Turkey and a fifth at the season-finale in China. After a promising performance in China, it was confirmed in December 2005 that Klien would drive for the Red Bull Racing outfit alongside David Coulthard for the 2006 season.

;2006

Klien started 2006 strongly, qualifying in the top-ten for the first two races of the season. In Bahrain he finished 8th, scoring a point. However, in Malaysia he collided with Kimi Räikkönen on the first lap and had to pit with suspension damage, before eventually dropping out with a hydraulic failure.

In 2006, Klien was unsuccessful in comparison to his more experienced teammate David Coulthard, as the Scot scored the team&#x27;s first podium and was more consistent than Klien throughout the season. In August 2006, it was confirmed that Klien would not stay with the Red Bull team for the upcoming 2007 season, or at least as a race driver, due to Red Bull&#x27;s signing of Mark Webber. After the two points finishes in Bahrain and Germany, there was some uncertainty as to where Klien would go next in his racing career, speculation suggested the United States as a logical choice for Klien, but he refused a ChampCar seat in a Red Bull-backed team for 2007, preferring to chase a Formula One drive with another team. As a result, the team announced that Klien had been fired for the last three races of the season in favour of test driver Robert Doornbos.

====Honda and BMW Sauber (2007–2009)====

On 15 November 2006, Honda Racing announced the signing of Klien as their test and reserve driver for the 2007 season. The Austrian made his debut for the Japanese works team at the Circuit de Catalunya, during the early pre-season testing during late November 2006. At the 2007 British Grand Prix, he replaced the injured Jenson Button for the second free practice session on Friday. On 11 July 2007, Klien was released by Honda F1 to test with Spyker with a view to replacing Christijan Albers who was released because of sponsorship problems. However, the seat went to Japanese driver Sakon Yamamoto.

In 2008 Klien signed as BMW Sauber&#x27;s test and reserve driver for the Formula One season. He also signed with Peugeot to race in 24 Hours of Le Mans. Driving the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP he finished third overall with Ricardo Zonta and Franck Montagny. In October he participated in Petit Le Mans in the American Le Mans Series, driving with Peugeot&#x27;s factory drivers Marc Gené and Nicolas Minassian.

Klien remained in the position of BMW Sauber&#x27;s test and reserve driver for . He also returned to Le Mans with Peugeot, finishing sixth overall in a 908 shared with Pedro Lamy and Minassian.

For , Klien was understood to be an option for Sauber before the seat went to Pedro de la Rosa.

====HRT (2010)====

Klien was then tipped to become Hispania Racing&#x27;s reserve driver despite being second favourite to ex-US F1 man José María López but neither Klien or López got the seat. It went to former Super Aguri F1 and Spyker F1 driver Sakon Yamamoto. However, he was later signed by Hispania as well as Yamamoto. He took part in his first Grand Prix weekend for three years at the , where he drove in the first practice session in place of Karun Chandhok. He replaced Chandhok again at the where his session was made difficult by problems with his car. At the he was confirmed as a replacement for the ill Sakon Yamamoto, marking his first grand prix since the 2006 Italian Grand Prix. He qualified in 22nd place, over a second ahead of team mate Bruno Senna, and ran just ahead of him in the race until a mechanical problem forced him to retire. He replaced Yamamoto for the final two races of the season in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, but the team did not retain his services into the season.

==Post-Formula One==

After Formula One, Klien began racing in a number of categories including endurance racing, sports cars and V8 Supercars. He was close to a deal with Peugeot to race in the World Endurance Championship in 2012 before the French company withdrew from racing.

Klien has taken part in a number of V8 Supercar drives, including the Bathurst 1000 where he teamed up with Russell Ingall.

Since late 2012, Klien writes a monthly column for the Pitpass.com website.

In 2014, Klien signed a deal with NewBlood By Morand Racing to race in their 2014 ELMS campaign.

In 2017, Klien joined the Bundesheer (Austrian Armed Forces) and will continue his racing career in addition to military service. He became an expert for ServusTV&#x27;s coverage of Formula One from the start of the season.

Klien competed in the 2021 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters part-time by driving a McLaren for the Polish JP Motorsport team in a total of three two-race rounds. After making his debut in the third round at Zolder, he returned to the grid in the next round at the Nürburgring and in the sixth round at Assen. His fifth-place finish in the first race at Assen was his only top-10 finish in six races.

In 2022 Klien continued racing GT3 machineries for JP Motorsport, making a switch to GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup and GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup.

<doc id="647269" wikidata="Q2587423" url="?curid=647269" title="Variable number tandem repeat">
<text>A variable number tandem repeat (or VNTR) is a location in a genome where a short nucleotide sequence is organized as a tandem repeat. These can be found on many chromosomes, and often show variations in length (number of repeats) among individuals. Each variant acts as an inherited allele, allowing them to be used for personal or parental identification. Their analysis is useful in genetics and biology research, forensics, and DNA fingerprinting.

==Structure and allelic variation==
In the schematic above, the rectangular blocks represent each of the repeated DNA sequences at a particular VNTR location. The repeats are in tandem – i.e. they are clustered together and oriented in the same direction. Individual repeats can be removed from (or added to) the VNTR via recombination or replication errors, leading to alleles with different numbers of repeats. Flanking regions are segments of repetitive sequence (shown here as thin lines), allowing the VNTR blocks to be extracted with restriction enzymes and analyzed by RFLP, or amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and their size determined by gel electrophoresis.

==Use in genetic analysis==
VNTRs were an important source of RFLP genetic markers used in linkage analysis (mapping) of diploid genomes. Now that many genomes have been sequenced, VNTRs have become essential to forensic crime investigations, via DNA fingerprinting and the CODIS database. When removed from surrounding DNA by the PCR or RFLP methods, and their size determined by gel electrophoresis or Southern blotting, they produce a pattern of bands unique to each individual. When tested with a group of independent VNTR markers, the likelihood of two unrelated individuals&#x27; having the same allelic pattern is extremely low. VNTR analysis is also being used to study genetic diversity and breeding patterns in populations of wild or domesticated animals. As such, VNTRs can be used to distinguish strains of bacterial pathogens. In this microbial forensics context, such assays are usually called Multiple Loci VNTR Analysis or MLVA.
==Inheritance==

In analyzing VNTR data, two basic genetic principles can be used:
* Identity Matching – both VNTR alleles from a specific location must match. If two samples are from the same individual, they must show the same allele pattern.
* Inheritance Matching – the VNTR alleles must follow the rules of inheritance. In matching an individual with his parents or children, a person must have an allele that matches one from each parent. If the relationship is more distant, such as a grandparent or sibling, then matches must be consistent with the degree of relatedness.

==Relationship to other types of repetitive DNA==

Repetitive DNA, representing over 40% of the human genome, is arranged in a bewildering array of patterns. Repeats were first identified by the extraction of Satellite DNA, which does not reveal how they are organized. The use of restriction enzymes showed that some repeat blocks were interspersed throughout the genome. DNA sequencing later showed that other repeats are clustered at specific locations, with tandem repeats being more common than inverted repeats (which may interfere with DNA replication). VNTRs are the class of clustered tandem repeats that exhibit allelic variation in their lengths.

==Classes==

VNTRs are a type of minisatellite in which the size of the repeat sequence is generally ten to one hundred base pairs. Minisatellites are a type of DNA tandem repeat sequence, meaning that the sequences repeat one after another without other sequences or nucleotides in between them. Minisatellites are characterized by a repeat sequence of about ten to one hundred nucleotides, and the number of times the sequence repeats varies from about five to fifty times. The sequences of minisatellites are larger than those of microsatellites, in which the repeat sequence is generally 1 to 6 nucleotides. The two types of repeat sequences are both tandem but are specified by the length of the repeat sequence. VNTRs, therefore, because they have repeat sequences of ten to one hundred nucleotides in which every repeat is exactly the same, are considered minisatellites. However, while all VNTRs are minisatellites, not all minisatellites are VNTRs. VNTRs can vary in number of repeats from individual to individual, as where some non-VNTR minisatellites have repeat sequences that repeat the same number of times in all individuals containing the tandem repeats in their genomes.

<text>Cristiano Monteiro da Matta (born 19 September 1973) is a Brazilian former professional racing driver. He won the CART Championship in 2002, and drove in Formula One with the Toyota team from 2003 to 2004.

==Biography==

===Origins and early career===

Da Matta&#x27;s father was Toninho da Matta, a 14-time Brazilian touring car champion. Born in Belo Horizonte, Cristiano da Matta began karting at the age of 16, adopting a helmet design nearly identical to his famous father&#x27;s helmet. He quickly rose to the top by winning numerous karting championships before winning the 1993 Brazilian Formula Ford championship. In 1994, he continued his successful ways, winning the Brazilian Formula 3 championship against the likes of Hélio Castroneves and Ricardo Zonta. In 1995, da Matta participated in the British Formula 3 series, winning one race and placing eighth in the standings. He then placed eighth in the following year&#x27;s Formula 3000 championship, with a best finish of fourth at Pau.

===North American racing===
1997 saw da Matta move to the United States for the Indy Lights racing series, in which he won &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; honors. The next year (1998), he won the championship by winning seven races and securing four pole positions. In 1999, da Matta raced in the CART series for Team Arciero Wells, which were running Toyota engines; da Matta drove a Toyota-powered car from then until 2004. His first win came in 2000, and despite some sponsor opposition he joined the front-running Newman/Haas Racing team for 2001. He won the CART drivers&#x27; championship in 2002 under Toyota power with the Newman/Haas Racing team, dominating the year with seven race wins and seven poles.

===Formula One===
Da Matta completed a move to Formula One in 2003, with the Toyota Formula One team. He scored 10 championship points that year, four more than seasoned veteran and teammate Olivier Panis, and soon made a name for himself in Formula One when he spent much of the first half of the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix hounding reigning World Champion Michael Schumacher in the monsoon-hit race before ultimately finishing tenth. He led the 2003 British Grand Prix for seventeen laps after the race was disrupted by a protester who invaded the track and triggered the deployment of the Safety Car. This caused most of the front-running cars to make unscheduled pit stops leaving da Matta in the lead, ultimately finishing seventh for one of four points-scoring finishes in his debut season. His fortunes took a downturn in 2004, however. Having scored only three championship points, da Matta lost his race seat to Ricardo Zonta after the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim. This was not only due to performance issues, but also due to da Matta openly making statements about how uncompetitive the Toyota was.

===Return to USA===
In 2005, da Matta moved back to the Champ Car World Series, to race for the PKV Racing team. That season he won the race at Portland, and finished 11th overall in the standings. For the 2006 Champ Car season, he switched to the Dale Coyne Racing to drive the No.19 Ford Lola, until 9 June 2006, when he switched teams again, to take over A. J. Allmendinger&#x27;s seat at RuSPORT. Second place at San Jose left him 6th overall in the series.

===Collision with deer during test===
On 3 August 2006, da Matta&#x27;s car was involved in a collision with a deer that ran in front of him as he headed towards turn 6 during Champ Car open testing at Road America. He hit the deer with his right front tire, the deer then flew back and hit da Matta in the cockpit. It is believed when the deer hit da Matta in the cockpit, he was knocked unconscious. He remained unconscious with his foot still on the throttle when the safety crew arrived and extricated da Matta from the car. Da Matta was then airlifted to Theda Clark Medical Center in Neenah, Wisconsin, where he underwent surgery to remove a subdural hematoma. Following the surgery, da Matta was placed in an induced coma, to allow for the swelling to subside. As of 7 August, da Matta was making &quot;slow but steady progress&quot;, while the doctors were working on reducing da Matta&#x27;s level of sedation. This slow recovery was confirmed on 9 August, as it was reported that da Matta was able to move &quot;all of his extremities spontaneously as well as in response to physical stimulation&quot;. On 20 August, da Matta was transferred out of intensive care. On 30 August, da Matta was confirmed to have made steady progress, conversing in English and Portuguese, and walking short distances. On 21 September 2006, da Matta was allowed to leave the hospital after having recovered better than expected.

When the Champ Car World Series returned to race in the Grand Prix of Road America on 24 September, da Matta gave the traditional command - &quot;start your engines&quot;. Throughout the next couple of years, he engaged in a training and therapy regime while deciding his racing future.

===Comeback===
On 20 March 2008, da Matta climbed back into a race car for the first time since his accident, completing a two-day test in a Riley Daytona Prototype prepared by reigning Rolex Sports Car Series champions GAINSCO/Bob Stallings Racing. He found speed right away, and team owner Bob Stallings said &quot;the comeback has begun.&quot; da Matta said, &quot;After the test, I realized I still know how to do this&quot;, &quot;The biggest thing I felt was just a sense of relief. For me, it was a big, big relief, bigger than big&quot;. da Matta paired with former Champ Car champion, Jimmy Vasser, to enter the Rolex Series racing at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in 2008. after a solid race, the pair were classified in 32nd position.

===Brazilian Championship Formula Truck===
In December 2009, da Matta tested a Fórmula Truck vehicle owned by Iveco, and in January 2010 confirmed that he would run the 2010 Fórmula Truck season for the team.

===American Le Mans Series===
In 2011 da Matta signed for Rocketsports Racing to race in the American Le Mans Series. He scored six points at the Grand Prix of Long Beach.

==Film and media==
Da Matta and his 1999 car appear in the movie &quot;Driven&quot;, starring Sylvester Stallone.

Da Matta is a playable character in the video games &quot;Formula One 2003&quot; and &quot;Formula One 04&quot;.

In 2017, a documentary was released about his and his father&#x27;s lives in motorsport, entitled &quot;Família Gasolina&quot; (Gasoline Family). It is available for free on YouTube.

==Post-racing career==
Da Matta is no longer racing and is involved in the financial and logistical side of the family Da Matta Design clothing business.

<text>Nick Lars Heidfeld (; born 10 May 1977) is a German former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to .

Born and raised in Mönchengladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Heidfeld began competitive kart racing aged 11. He progressed to Formula Ford in 1994, winning multiple national championships before graduating to Formula Three. After finishing third in 1996, Heidfeld won the German Formula Three Championship the following year, also winning the Monaco F3 Grand Prix. He then finished runner-up to Juan Pablo Montoya in International F3000, before winning the series in 1999. A test driver for McLaren since , Heidfeld signed for Prost in to partner Jean Alesi, making his Formula One debut at the . After a non-classified championship finish for Prost with the AP03, Heidfeld moved to Sauber in , finishing fourth on debut and taking his maiden podium at the as he outscored rookie teammate Kimi Räikkönen. 

Heidfeld remained at Sauber for two further seasons before moving to Jordan in , where he scored multiple points finishes in the relatively uncompetitive EJ14. He signed for Williams in , scoring several podiums amongst his maiden pole position at the . Following a string of high-profile injuries, Heidfeld left Williams to re-join Sauber—now known as BMW Sauber—in . He scored eight podiums across four seasons with BMW Sauber, finishing a career-best fifth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in . BMW withdrew from the sport at the end of the season, leaving Heidfeld without a seat. He replaced Pedro de la Rosa at Sauber from the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix onwards, and joined Renault for his campaign to substitute for an injured Robert Kubica. Heidfeld took his final podium in Malaysia before he was replaced by Bruno Senna after the . Heidfeld departed Formula One with one pole position, two fastest laps and 13 podiums, the latter of which remains the record without winning a Grand Prix.

Heidfeld moved to Formula E for its inaugural 2014–15 season with Venturi, achieving his first podium at the Moscow ePrix before joining Mahindra in 2015. Over three seasons with Mahindra, Heidfeld scored seven further podiums before leaving at the end of 2017–18. Outside of formula racing, Heidfeld has entered six editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, winning the LMP1-L class in and finishing fourth overall twice. He competed in five seasons of the FIA World Endurance Championship from 2012 to 2016 with Rebellion, and finished runner-up in the American Le Mans Series in 2013. Heidfeld served as chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association in 2010.

==Early life and career==

Heidfeld was born in Mönchengladbach, West Germany on 10 May 1977, and began racing karts at the age of 11 in 1988. In 1994 he moved into the German Formula Ford series, gaining widespread attention by winning 8 of the 9 races to take the title that season. In 1995 he won the German International Formula Ford 1800 Championship, and came second in the Zetec Cup. This led to a drive in the German Formula Three Championship for 1996, where he finished third overall, after taking 3 wins. He entered the end of the season Macau Grand Prix and won the first heat of the race, attracting the attention of compatriot Norbert Haug, who later signed him up for the West Competition team.

==Junior career==
The following year Heidfeld won the German F3 Championship for Bertram Schäfer Racing, with support from McLaren/West, including a win at the Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race. In 1998, he won three races and was runner-up in the International Formula 3000 championship, with the West Competition team. At the final race of the season he was demoted to the back of the grid from pole position, after his team used non-compliant fuel. He finished the race ninth and out of the points, losing the championship by seven points to Juan Pablo Montoya. During that season, he was also the official test driver for the McLaren-Mercedes Formula One team. In 1999, he won the International Formula 3000 Championship. That year he also took the official track record at the Goodwood Festival of Speed which stood for 20 years. He was also a member of the Mercedes squad that raced at the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, but the team withdrew after the Mercedes-Benz CLR back-flipped on the Mulsanne Straight while Mark Webber and Peter Dumbreck were driving.

==Formula One career==

===Prost (2000)===
Heidfeld was signed as a race driver for the Prost Grand Prix F1 team for the 2000 season, alongside Formula One veteran Jean Alesi. Heidfeld struggled with his new car and suffered a string of retirements, as well as colliding with his teammate on more than one occasion.

===Sauber (2001–2003)===
He departed Prost at the end of that season, before signing a three-year contract with Sauber for 2001. He was partnered with then rookie driver Kimi Räikkönen. Heidfeld scored his first podium with a third-place finish in the Brazilian Grand Prix. After the announcement of Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s retirement, many thought that Heidfeld would replace him in the McLaren-Mercedes team, as he had Mercedes backing and had outscored the much more inexperienced Räikkönen by three points over the year. However, the McLaren seat went to Räikkönen, and Heidfeld stayed with Sauber for 2002 and 2003, where he racked up a number of points finishes. In 2002 he outperformed another rookie teammate, Felipe Massa, but was then beaten by his more experienced fellow countryman, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, in 2003.

===Jordan (2004)===
At the end of the 2003 season, Heidfeld was replaced at the Sauber team by Jordan&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella and looked to be without a race seat for the 2004 season. However, after impressing during a series of preseason tests, it was announced that Heidfeld would race with the financially strapped Jordan team, alongside rookie Giorgio Pantano. The EJ14 was an upgrade of the previous season&#x27;s uncompetitive EJ13 and proved slow. Despite this, Heidfeld often outperformed the car, finishing ahead of more competitive vehicles. He finished seventh at the Monaco Grand Prix and eighth at the Canadian Grand Prix and finished the season with three points.

===Williams (2005)===
During the winter of 2004–2005, Heidfeld tested with the Williams team, in a &#x27;shootout&#x27; against Antônio Pizzonia for the second race seat alongside Mark Webber. At the Williams launch on 31 January 2005, it was announced that Heidfeld would be the race driver for the team in 2005, replacing the McLaren-bound Juan Pablo Montoya.

He performed well throughout the season, often finishing ahead of teammate Webber. At the seventh race of the 2005 season at the Nürburgring circuit, his home Grand Prix, Heidfeld took his first and only pole position. In Monaco he finished second, which he equalled at the Nürburgring in the same season.

Heidfeld missed the Italian and Belgian Grands Prix due to injuries suffered in a testing accident. Scheduled to come back for Brazil, he was injured again when hit by a motorbike when out cycling, and therefore forced to sit out the rest of the season.

===BMW Sauber (2006–2009)===

====2006====
Heidfeld gained a contract with his then Williams&#x27; engine supplier, BMW, when they bought the Sauber team (BMW and Sauber merger) and entered Formula One as BMW Sauber for the 2006 season, replacing Felipe Massa who was bound for Ferrari.

During 2006 Heidfeld scored points several times for his new team. At Melbourne he ran as high as second until the safety car came out. He eventually finished fourth. At Indianapolis, he was eliminated in a spectacular first lap accident which saw fellow drivers Scott Speed, Jenson Button, Kimi Räikkönen and Juan Pablo Montoya also go out. Heidfeld&#x27;s car was launched into a quadruple barrel roll, but he and the other drivers all walked away unharmed. The Hungarian Grand Prix saw Heidfeld give BMW Sauber their first podium finish and best result of the year, when he finished third, even though he had only qualified tenth on the grid.

At the end of 2006, Heidfeld was quoted attacking the media&#x27;s saturation coverage of his teammate Robert Kubica, who had scored fewer points than him. This has happened two other times in the German&#x27;s career; in 2001 when he was teammates with Kimi Räikkönen (whom he beat twelve points to nine) and in 2002, when he was teammates with Felipe Massa (whom he beat by seven points to four). Räikkönen and Massa later formed the 2007 Ferrari driver line-up.

====2007====


Heidfeld started the 2007 season strongly. In Bahrain, he chased down and overtook reigning world champion Fernando Alonso around the outside, finishing half a minute ahead of his BMW teammate Kubica. He scored three fourth places in the opening three races, a sixth in Monaco, and a second place at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he also out-qualified both Ferraris, equalling his best ever Grand Prix finish. After retiring from fifth place at Indianapolis, he was outscored by teammate Kubica at both Magny-Cours and Silverstone. At an eventful European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, Heidfeld&#x27;s home circuit, where he collided with Kubica on the opening lap, he recovered and overtook Kubica on the final lap to finish sixth, despite making six pitstops during the race. Heidfeld returned to form in Hungary, qualifying second and finishing third to score his and BMW&#x27;s second podium of the season. He finished fourth at the Turkish and Italian Grand Prix, and fifth in the Belgian Grand Prix. He eventually finished a career-best fifth in the championship with 61 points, outpointing Kubica by 22 points.

On 28 April 2007, Heidfeld drove three demonstration laps around the Nürburgring&#x27;s legendary 14 mile Nordschleife track, which made him the first driver in 31 years to pilot a current F1 car there. About 45,000 spectators attended the event, which was held after a four-hour VLN endurance race.

====2008====
After several months of negotiations, BMW confirmed that Heidfeld would stay with the team for .

Heidfeld began the 2008 season strongly, finishing second in Australia after qualifying fifth. In Malaysia, he qualified fifth but dropped down to tenth at the first corner after being pushed wide by Jarno Trulli. He got back up to sixth, also setting his first ever fastest lap in the process. In Bahrain he started from sixth place but he did not gain a place at the start, but passed Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen to climb up to fourth. He finished there and this fourth gave him second in the championship.

After a few disappointing qualifying sessions and races in the following weeks (after which the German press started to call him &quot;Leidfeld&quot;, with &quot;Leid&quot; meaning &quot;misery&quot; in German), Kubica and Heidfeld made BMW Sauber history by securing the third-year team&#x27;s first victory, and first one-two finish respectively in Canada. Heidfeld was positioned eighth on the grid and after losing a place at the start, before gaining it back, was sitting comfortably in eighth place once again before a safety car situation saw the top 7 cars enter the pits in what was to soon become a bizarre series of errors that left Heidfeld and Kubica battling for the top two places. Heidfeld was switched to a one-stop fuel strategy and came out of his stop ahead of Kubica, but considerably heavier on fuel. Not long afterwards, Heidfeld moved off the racing line allowing Kubica to make an easy pass, which then allowed the lighter BMW Sauber to build up a considerable lead on Heidfeld, who was occupied with preventing Fernando Alonso, also in a lighter car, from chasing Kubica. The gap built by Kubica allowed him to rejoin the race comfortably in the lead after his final pitstop with no threats behind him. Heidfeld finished the race second, solidifying his fifth-place position in the driver&#x27;s points although his post-race body language suggested he was unhappy to have ceded a potential win for the benefit of the team. Heidfeld had a disappointing race in France, failing to score any points. He came back strongly at the British Grand Prix, starting fifth and finishing second in the wet conditions. Another strong performance, where he set the fastest lap of the race for the second time this season, was his home grand prix at the Hockenheimring showed that, for the time being, he had reversed the performance deficit to his teammate. Another second-place finish at the Belgian Grand Prix, followed by 5th and 6th-place finishes in Italy and Singapore respectively put him just one point behind current World Champion Kimi Räikkönen with just three races remaining.

It was confirmed on 6 October that both Heidfeld and teammate Kubica would remain at the BMW Sauber team for the season.
In the last three races Heidfeld scored four points, ending in sixth place in the standings after being passed by Fernando Alonso at the last round of the season. However, Heidfeld became only the second driver to finish 18 races in a single season, after Tiago Monteiro completed the same feat with Jordan in 2005. Heidfeld also became the first driver to finish every single race in a season since Michael Schumacher in 2002.

====2009====
Heidfeld began in Australia by qualifying in 11th place and finishing 10th in the race. At the Malaysian Grand Prix, Heidfeld again qualified in 11th, but started 10th as Sebastian Vettel was issued a 10 place drop (for an incident caused in Australia with Heidfeld&#x27;s teammate Kubica). The race was stopped due to torrential rain on the 33rd lap, when Heidfeld was third, but as set out in the regulations, the result was taken at the end of the penultimate completed lap, when Heidfeld had been running second. Because less than 75% of the race distance had been covered, the drivers only received half points. He scored a further 2 points at the , and finished 5th at Spa to score another 4 points. A seventh-place finish at Monza added a further 2 points to his 2009 tally. Nevertheless, four points-scoring finishes in the final six races secured him thirteenth position in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, two points ahead of Kubica.

In Singapore, Heidfeld&#x27;s run of 41 consecutive classified finishes was brought to an end due to a collision with Force India&#x27;s Adrian Sutil.

===2010: Different stints===

====Mercedes and Pirelli test driver====
Following BMW&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the sport at the end of the 2009 season, Heidfeld&#x27;s future in Formula One was uncertain. It was mentioned that he was considered to drive for Mercedes GP alongside fellow German Nico Rosberg but the team signed another German in Michael Schumacher instead. McLaren was also a potential destination however these negotiations came to nothing as well. Heidfeld was then tipped for a seat at Sauber alongside Kamui Kobayashi but they decided to go with Pedro de la Rosa. Heidfeld was then in the running for a Renault seat alongside fellow BMW Sauber refugee Robert Kubica, but on 4 February, Heidfeld was confirmed as the test and reserve driver for Mercedes.

At the Australian Grand Prix, Heidfeld was chosen to succeed Pedro de la Rosa as Chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association. He left the position upon taking the role of Pirelli&#x27;s test driver ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix, and was replaced by Rubens Barrichello.

In August 2010, with Heidfeld not yet having driven the Mercedes MGP W01 car, the team released him from his contract so that he could become the Pirelli tyre company&#x27;s test driver. Heidfeld tested a Toyota TF109 car fitted with Pirelli tyres on a number of occasions in 2010, ahead of the firm&#x27;s replacement of Bridgestone as the sport&#x27;s sole tyre supplier in . Heidfeld completed three tests for Pirelli in Mugello, Paul Ricard and Jerez before being released from his duties to join Sauber, with his place being taken by Romain Grosjean.

====Returns to F1 with Sauber (2010)====
In September 2010, Heidfeld returned to the Formula One grid, replacing Pedro de la Rosa at the Sauber team for the remainder of the 2010 season. This marked his third spell with them. On 4 October 2010, Sauber confirmed their driver line-up for 2011 as Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Pérez, seemingly leaving Heidfeld without a drive for 2011, before replacing Robert Kubica at Renault, who was injured in a rally accident on 6 February 2011.

===Lotus Renault (2011)===

On 9 February, Lotus Renault GP confirmed that Heidfeld would be sharing testing duties with Bruno Senna on the Saturday and Sunday of the four-day test at Jerez, to evaluate the drivers in preparation of replacing the injured and former BMW Sauber teammate Robert Kubica, who had suffered long-term injuries to his arm and hand in a crash whilst rallying in Italy, for the season. On the Saturday, Heidfeld set the quickest time of the day, stating that he enjoyed his day&#x27;s running – 86 laps – with the team, and had fun driving the car. Heidfeld was confirmed as Kubica&#x27;s replacement on 16 February 2011. In Australia, the first race of the season following the cancellation of the , Heidfeld qualified 18th and ended 12th after suffering significant damage to his car due to another competitor driving into him at the start of race. On 10 April 2011, Heidfeld finished third, after starting sixth, in the at Sepang, breaking Stefan Johansson&#x27;s record of 12 podiums without a win. He added another 12th place in China, before a seventh-place finish in Turkey after a close battle with teammate Petrov. Two eighth places in Spain and Monaco were followed by a retirement at the , after running into the back of Kamui Kobayashi and causing damage to his front wing, which broke under acceleration and collapsed under the car. He was forced to retire after his car caught fire after exiting the pit lane on lap 25 in the Hungarian Grand Prix. Heidfeld was replaced by Bruno Senna ahead of the . Heidfeld officially parted company with the team on 2 September 2011.

===Legacy===
In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Heidfeld was ranked the 23rd best Formula One driver of all time.

==Endurance racing==

On 1 February 2012, it was confirmed that Heidfeld would join the Rebellion Racing team to contest both the Le Mans 24 Hours and selected races of the FIA World Endurance Championship. In addition to Le Mans, he also raced at the Sebring 12 Hours and Spa 6 Hours, sharing a Lola-Toyota LMP1 car with teammates Neel Jani and Nicolas Prost. The car finished 32nd overall and seventh in class at Sebring after encountering problems, before leading home a Rebellion one-two in the unofficial privateer class at Spa, finishing fifth overall behind the four works Audis. At Le Mans, Heidfeld and his teammates went one better by finishing fourth, splitting the Audis after a fast and problem-free run.

==Formula E==

On 26 June 2014, Heidfeld signed up for the inaugural season of Formula E for Venturi Grand Prix. In the first race at the 2014 Beijing ePrix, he had a spectacular accident at the final corner on the final lap with e.Dams Renault driver Nicolas Prost whilst fighting for the lead. Prost later accepted the blame for the accident. At the 2014 Putrajaya ePrix, he retired from the race after a collision this time with Franck Montagny but to add insult to injury, he was excluded from the 19th position finish for changing his car outside the permitted area during his pit stop, meaning he cannot count the race as a round where he drops a score.

==Personal life==

Heidfeld lives in Stäfa, Switzerland with his fiancée, daughter (born 2005), and sons (born 2007, 2010). He has an elder brother, Tim, and a younger brother, Sven, a former racing driver who is now a motorsport commentator for German television.

His nickname to Formula One fans is &quot;Quick Nick&quot;, which he got while driving for Williams in 2005.

<doc id="647275" wikidata="Q61917" url="?curid=647275" title="Giorgio Pantano">
<text>Giorgio Pantano (born 4 February 1979) is an Italian former professional racing driver who drove for the Jordan Formula One team for much of the 2004 season before being replaced by Timo Glock. He also raced in Formula 3000. He retired from racing at the end of 2014.

He raced in the GP2 Series from its inaugural year in 2005 until his championship campaign in 2008, holding the record for most races competed and most races won in the series. As of 2011, these records have been taken over by Luca Filippi (86 starts) and Pastor Maldonado (10 wins) respectively.

==Career==

===Early years===
Born in Conselve, near Padua, Pantano is the holder of one of the best records ever in karting, where he started at age nine. Nico Rosberg grew up with a poster of Pantano on his bedroom wall and later would describe the Italian as being &quot;probably the best of all time in karts.&quot; Fernando Alonso once called Pantano &quot;invincible&quot; and that in karting he had looked up to him as being &quot;a really incredible talent.&quot;

In his first year in Cadet karting he achieved the Italian and European titles. In 1994 he won the Italian and World titles in Junior karting and in 1995 and 1996 won the European Formula A title. In 1996 he was signed by AMG-Mercedes, from where he went through a difficult patch to enter Formula One racing. He entered the winter series of Palmer Audi in 1999 and tested for the Astromega Formula 3000 team before signing for the KMS team that would take him to race in Formula Three in his first year of single-seater racing. He won his first race and went on to win the title.

===F3000===
His first taste of Formula One came in 2000, when he was tested by Benetton. However, he joined Astromega in Formula 3000 in 2001 and won at Monza. That same year he tested for McLaren. In 2002 he tested for Williams and Minardi, but was unable to break into Formula One, so he signed for the Durango team and won two races in the International Formula 3000 series in 2003, which earned him third place in the championship. He nearly spent 2003 in Champ Car, but the BC Motorsports team with whom he believed he had a contract proved to be fake.

===Formula One===
Pantano had been all set to make his Formula One debut for Jaguar, however two days before he was due to sign with the squad they concluded a deal with Christian Klien, who was able to bring $10 million of funding from Red Bull. The Italian instead signed for the Jordan Formula One team in early 2004, and after minimal testing his season proved troublesome. He finished last in his first race in Australia, while his more experienced teammate Nick Heidfeld, retired with a transmission problem. He continued racing, never managing to qualify or finish any higher than around the back of the field, and retiring on several occasions, failing to grab much attention. He was replaced for a one-off by German debutant Timo Glock (due to financial reasons) at the Canadian Grand Prix, who scored two points finishing seventh, ahead of teammate Nick Heidfeld who was eighth. Pantano returned to his seat in the team for the next race in United States, but went out at the first corner after colliding with other drivers. He continued with more disappointing results until the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, after which he was replaced by Timo Glock for the remaining three races of the season. Pantano later divulged that it had been his own choice to stop racing with Jordan due to the financial burden placed on his family and his own feelings that the team was favouring his teammate Heidfeld over him. Pantano was linked to returning to Formula One in with Campos Meta but the team confirmed that Bruno Senna and Karun Chandhok would be joining the team.

===GP2 and IndyCar===
After his unsuccessful season in Formula One, he left the series. In 2005 he raced in the inaugural GP2 Series season for the SuperNova team, alongside Adam Carroll of Northern Ireland, who defied expectations by outpacing Pantano. He also drove in the Indy Racing League for Chip Ganassi Racing in the two road-course races in the 2005 season. The team scaled back to two cars for 2006, signing champion Dan Wheldon alongside Scott Dixon. Pantano had several off-season Champ Car tests for PKV Racing and Mi-Jack Conquest Racing but they failed to result in a ride for the season and Pantano sat out most of the early part of the new season before finding a new lease of life in Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s GP2 team FMS. After a crash on his first time back, Pantano impressed in the car, his experience gaining him solid points-scoring finishes in the second half of the season, including three wins. He raced for ex-Formula One driver Adrián Campos&#x27;s team in 2007. On 30 June he claimed the team&#x27;s maiden victory in the series, winning a chaotic feature race in Magny-Cours.
For the 2008 season he signed to partner Spaniard Javier Villa at the Racing Engineering team. Pantano started the season well, taking fourth and third positions in the Catalunya feature and sprint races respectively. Things were even better in the Istanbul Park feature race, for which he took pole and won the race. After a measured drive to fourth in the sprint race Pantano led the championship, but lost the lead to Bruno Senna following two retirements in Monaco. However he retook the lead following a win at the Magny-Cours feature race, in which Senna retired. Despite retirement in the sprint race Pantano left Magny-Cours with the championship lead. Following further feature race wins in both Silverstone and Hockenheimring Pantano increased his championship lead over Senna.

A bad weekend in Hungaroring dented his advantage but he bounced back with pole for the feature race at the new Valencia. Having led the whole race in dominant style Pantano faced the heartbreak of running out of fuel on the last lap, handing victory to Vitaly Petrov. However, Senna also ran out of fuel, and thus Pantano&#x27;s lead was undamaged. With Senna retiring again in the sprint race, where Pantano finished third, the Italian held a 13-point lead in the series with two rounds remaining. At Spa-Francorchamps he qualified fourth, before a mechanical problem under the safety car dropped him down the order. Attempting to fight back, he spun at La Source with two laps to go, before running into Lucas di Grassi at the same corner on the final lap, causing him to be disqualified. At Monza, he took the GP2 crown, in spite of finishing 10th. His nearest rival Bruno Senna only finished fifth, thus handing Pantano the crown.

At the Silverstone race, Pantano became the most successful driver of all time in the F1 feeder championships (F2 / F3000 / GP2). His win in the Saturday race gave him a cumulative F3000/GP2 win tally of 14, taking him above the 13 F2/F3000 championship wins of Mike Thackwell and 12 European championship Formula Two wins of Jochen Rindt. (If non-championship wins are included, Rindt and other drivers exceed this total). Pantano&#x27;s Silverstone win was his eighth in the GP2 Series, making him also the most successful driver in GP2 history.

===Superleague Formula===
Unable to find a drive in Formula One and unable to return to GP2 as former champions are not permitted, Pantano joined up with Superleague Formula to drive the A.C. Milan entry. Pantano won one race for A.C. Milan at the Magny-Cours round.

===After 2010===

Pantano was linked to a return to the IndyCar Series in 2010, driving a Panther Racing entry. He instead signed on to drive in Auto GP for Super Nova Racing, finishing 13th in the championship.

Pantano returned to the IndyCar Series in 2011 as an injury replacement for Justin Wilson in races at Sonoma and Baltimore, and did not consider to racing again in Europe in the near future.

Pantano made a brief return to IndyCar in 2012, racing at the 2012 Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio for Chip Ganassi Racing. He finished 14th after qualifying in 24th place. In 2013 Pantano competed in the International GT Open GTS class and won the championship with three wins and five podium finishes in 13 races. He subsequently switched to the Blancpain Sprint Series for 2014, sharing a Bhaitech-run McLaren MP4-12C with Fabio Onidi, with a view to pursuing a career as a sportscar racer. He also secured a drive at the 2014 Spa 24 Hours for Thierry Boutsen&#x27;s Boutsen Ginion team, sharing a McLaren with Frédéric Vervisch, Olivier Grotz and Karim Ojjeh.

He is a GP2 Series race winner and is now racing in the FIA World Endurance Championship, in which he gained the 2013 and 2014 GT Drivers&#x27; Titles whilst driving as a factory Ferrari driver. He won the 2008 FIA GT Championship, 2011 Le Mans Series and 2012 International GT Open and took three class victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in 2008, 2012 and 2014. He also was successful at the 2009 and 2015 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, 2010 12 Hours of Sebring and 2011 Petit Le Mans.

==Career==

=== First wins in single-seaters ===
Born in Rome, at age ten Bruni lied about his age to the director of &quot;La Pista d&#x27;Oro&quot;, a Go kart track in Italy, in order to begin an amateur Karting career (twelve was the minimum age to compete). His first experience with racing cars was in the Italian Formula Renault Campus in 1997; he won the Title in 1998. For the following season he moved on to the European Formula Renault Eurocup 2.0, taking another Title. Then he entered the British Formula 3, where he came fifth in 2000 and fourth in 2001. After he had raced in various similar European series like the Euro Formula 3000, finishing third in 2003, he caught the attention of Minardi.

=== Formula 1 ===

Bruni started testing for Minardi in 2003. However the biggest struggle of his career was finding enough sponsorship to compete for them in Formula 1 in 2004.

In fact Bruni did join Minardi for the 2004 Formula 1 season, though he struggled in a car which was considerably less developed than the rest of the grid. He was one of only two drivers to contest the majority of the season without scoring any points.

=== GP2 Series ===
In 2005 Bruni competed in the GP2 Series, the single-seater Championship which is part of the Formula 1 support package and which is intended to be its feeder series. He won Race 1 at Barcelona and took second at Monaco driving for Coloni. The Italian left the Team in September before the Monza weekend. Joining up with Durango, he started on pole position at Spa-Francorchamps and finished tenth in the Drivers&#x27; Classification.

In 2006 Bruni competed again in the GP2 Series, this time with the new Trident Racing squad. He scored two victories, the first at Imola and the second at Hockenheim. At the end of the season he was seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Classification.

=== GT competitions ===

For 2007, he switched to the sportscar racing as he joined the FIA GT Championship with Team AF Corse MOTOROLA in a Ferrari 430 GT3. He and his teammate Stéphane Ortelli finished the season 2nd in the GT2 class with 3 wins.

After competing in the American Le Mans Series for Risi Competizione, Bruni shifted focus to Europe for 2011, teaming with Giancarlo Fisichella in an AF Corse Ferrari F458 Italia, winning the driver&#x27;s and team&#x27;s championship in the LM GTE Pro class of the Le Mans Series and helping win the team&#x27;s championship in the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup. Bruni finished 2nd at the Le Mans 24hrs and won the Petit Le Mans.

At the 2012 12 Hours of Sebring, Bruni disqualified his car by attempting to shunt off the BMW M3 GT of Joey Hand on the last lap to help the sister car of Olivier Beretta to win the overall grand touring classification, though the BMW was in a different class and the car would not have classified anyway because it did not make 70% of the race leader&#x27;s distance.

In the 80th edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2012, Bruni and the AF Corse Team scored first place in the GTE-Pro class along with his co-drivers Toni Vilander and Giancarlo Fisichella; their Ferrari 458 Italia covered a total of 336 laps (2,845.53 miles) of the Circuit de la Sarthe.

Bruni scored three wins and two second places at the 2013 FIA World Endurance Championship, so he won the GTE-Pro teams trophy and the GTE drivers and manufacturers cups.

In February 2017, Ferrari and Gianmaria Bruni announce that, by mutual consent, they have early terminated their relationship.
After a collaboration started in 2007, Bruni will leave Ferrari at the end of June of this year. Bruni signed a contract with Porsche.

As a result of the contract termination settlement he sat out the first half of the 2017 racing season, making his Porsche debut in July at Watkins Glen. In 2018, he raced for Porsche in the WEC replacing Frédéric Makowiecki.

<text>Zsolt Baumgartner (born 1 January 1981) is a Hungarian former racing driver who raced for the Jordan and Minardi teams in Formula One. He remains the only Hungarian driver to have competed and to have scored a point in Formula One.

==Career==
Baumgartner made his Formula One race debut at the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix, substituting for the injured Ralph Firman in the Jordan team; he also took part in the Italian Grand Prix that year.

Plans were made for Baumgartner to drive for Jordan again in 2004 with sponsorship from oil company MOL Rt. However, he failed to agree terms with Jordan and was signed by Minardi instead. This caused MOL Rt. to decrease its sponsorship amount, leading Baumgartner and his management to set up a &quot;Zsolt Baumgartner Supporter&#x27;s Club&quot;, a plan similar to that employed by Justin Wilson in 2003.

Baumgartner raced throughout the Formula One season, and after two near-misses (ninth in Monaco and 10th in Canada) he managed to take Minardi&#x27;s first point in over two years by finishing eighth (classified second last and the last car to take the chequered flag) in the United States Grand Prix held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

==Champ Car World Series==
In March 2007 he was confirmed as the test and reserve driver for Minardi Team USA, former boss Paul Stoddart&#x27;s recently acquired Champ Car World Series team. Baumgartner only participated in a handful of tests for the team and made no race starts. Prior to the 2008 season, Champ Car unified with the rival IndyCar Series and Stoddart and the Minardi name left the sport.

==Superleague Formula==
In 2008 Baumgartner became the test driver for team Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in Superleague Formula.

<doc id="647283" wikidata="Q4019783" url="?curid=647283" title="Lidocaine/prilocaine">
<text>Lidocaine/prilocaine is a eutectic mixture of equal quantities (by weight) of lidocaine and prilocaine. A 5% emulsion preparation, containing 2.5% each of lidocaine/prilocaine, is marketed by APP Pharmaceuticals under the trade name EMLA (an abbreviation for &quot;Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics&quot;). As a spray, it is marketed under the name Tempe (topical eutectic-like mixture for premature ejaculation) (PSD502) that can be used by men to help with premature ejaculation. The spray is manufactured by Plethora Solutions and branded as Fortacin in the UK and Recordati in the EU.

==Eutectic mixture==
Separately, lidocaine and prilocaine are solid bases. When mixed in equal quantities by weight, however, they form a eutectic mixture – that is the melting point of the mixture is lower than the melting points of the individual components. The lidocaine/prilocaine eutectic mixture is an oil with a melting point of 18 °C, and can be formulated into preparations without the use of a non-aqueous solvent. This allows higher concentrations of anaesthetic to be formulated into the preparation and maintained during application.

==Clinical use==

===Indications===
The lidocaine/prilocaine combination is indicated for dermal anaesthesia. Specifically it is applied to prevent pain associated with intravenous catheter insertion, blood sampling, superficial surgical procedures, and topical anaesthesia of leg ulcers for cleansing or debridement. Also, it can be used to numb the skin before tattooing as well as electrolysis and laser hair removal. It is also sometimes used in advance of injected local anaesthetics for minor surgery and biopsies.

A topical spray consisting of an aerosol formulation of lidocaine and prilocaine was evaluated under the name PSD502 for use in treating premature ejaculation. The spray is applied on the penile skin prior to intercourse. While this formulation was not approved by the FDA, a similar product, Promescent, is available over-the-counter in the U.S.

===Dosage forms===
Lidocaine/prilocaine eutectic mixture is marketed as a 5% oil-in-water emulsion incorporated in a cream base (EMLA cream) or a cellulose disk (EMLA patch). The cream is applied under an occlusive dressing, while the patch incorporates an occlusive dressing to facilitate absorption of lidocaine and prilocaine into the area where anaesthesia is required. Local dermal anaesthesia is achieved after approximately 60 minutes, whereupon the occlusive dressing (or patch) is removed. The duration of anaesthesia is approximately two hours following removal of the occlusive dressing.

E. Fougera &amp; Co., makers of the generic cream widely used in the United States as Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream, 2.5%/2.5%, recommends different timing for application of the cream as well as length of anesthesia. They state the cream must be applied at least one hour before the start of a routine procedure and for two hours before the start of a painful procedure. Additionally, they state that the duration of effective skin anesthesia will be at least one hour after removal of the occlusive dressing.

===Circumcision===
Lidocaine/prilocaine eutectic mixture has been used during circumcision in newborn boys and has been considered efficacious and safe to lessen pain from circumcision.

The European Medicines Agency concludes in its latest (2014) statement on Emla:
&quot;Safety and efficacy for the use of EMLA on genital skin and genital mucosa have not been established in children younger than 12 years. Available paediatric data do not demonstrate adequate efficacy for circumcision.&quot;

The Patient Information Leaflet of EMLA in the UK states: &quot;EMLA Cream should not be applied to the genital skin (e.g. penis) and genital mucosa (e.g. in the vagina) of children (below 12 years of age) owing to insufficient data on absorption of active
substances.&quot;

== Tempe ==
The spray is a combination of local anaesthetics lidocaine and prilocaine in a metered-dose aerosol that is sprayed directly on the penis to numb sensations. It was developed by the same group that invented the erectile dysfunction drug sildenafil. The drug was approved in Europe and was released in the UK market in November 2016 and within the EU will be marketed by, early in 2017 In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to approve the drug in 2018.

<text>Prenatal testing is a tool that can be used to detect some birth defects at various stages prior to birth. Prenatal testing consists of prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis, which are aspects of prenatal care that focus on detecting problems with the pregnancy as early as possible. These may be anatomic and physiologic problems with the health of the zygote, embryo, or fetus, either before gestation even starts (as in preimplantation genetic diagnosis) or as early in gestation as practicable. Screening can detect problems such as neural tube defects, chromosome abnormalities, and gene mutations that would lead to genetic disorders and birth defects such as spina bifida, cleft palate, Down syndrome, trisomy 18, Tay–Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome. Some tests are designed to discover problems which primarily affect the health of the mother, such as PAPP-A to detect pre-eclampsia or glucose tolerance tests to diagnose gestational diabetes. Screening can also detect anatomical defects such as hydrocephalus, anencephaly, heart defects, and amniotic band syndrome.

Prenatal screening focuses on finding problems among a large population with affordable and noninvasive methods. Prenatal diagnosis focuses on pursuing additional detailed information once a particular problem has been found, and can sometimes be more invasive. The most common screening procedures are routine ultrasounds, blood tests, and blood pressure measurement. Common diagnosis procedures include amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the fetus will be aborted, though physicians and patients also find it useful to diagnose high-risk pregnancies early so that delivery can be scheduled in a tertiary care hospital where the baby can receive appropriate care.

Prenatal testing in recent years has been moving towards non-invasive methods to determine the fetal risk for genetic disorders. The rapid advancement of modern high-performance molecular technologies along with the discovery of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma has led to new methods for the determination of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies. This type of testing is referred to as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) or as non-invasive prenatal screening. Invasive procedures remain important, though, especially for their diagnostic value in confirming positive non-invasive findings and detecting genetic disorders. Birth defects have an occurrence between 1 and 6%.

==Purpose==
There are three purposes of prenatal diagnosis: (1) to enable timely medical or surgical treatment of a condition before or after birth, (2) to give the parents the chance to abort a fetus with the diagnosed condition, and (3) to give parents the chance to prepare psychologically, socially, financially, and medically for a baby with a health problem or disability, or for the likelihood of a stillbirth. Prior information about problems in pregnancy means that healthcare staff as well as parents can better prepare themselves for the delivery of a child with a health problem. For example, Down syndrome is associated with cardiac defects that may need intervention immediately upon birth.


=== Prenatal screening ===

==== Maternal serum screening ====
First-trimester maternal serum screening can check levels of free β-hCG, PAPP-A, intact or beta hCG, or h-hCG in the woman&#x27;s serum, and combine these with the measurement of nuchal translucency (NT). Some institutions also look for the presence of a fetal nasalbone on the ultrasound.

Second-trimester maternal serum screening (AFP screening, triple screen, quad screen, or penta screen) can check levels of alpha fetoprotein, β-hCG, inhibin-A, estriol, and h-hCG (hyperglycosolated hCG) in the woman&#x27;s serum.

The triple test measures serum levels of AFP, estriol, and beta-hCG, with a 70% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate. It is complemented in some regions of the United States, as the &quot;Quad test&quot; (adding inhibin A to the panel, resulting in an 81% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate for detecting Down syndrome when taken at 15–18 weeks of gestational age).

The biomarkers PAPP-A and β-hCG seem to be altered for pregnancies resulting from ICSI, causing a higher false-positive rate. Correction factors have been developed and
should be used when screening for Down&#x27;s syndrome in singleton pregnancies after ICSI, but in twin pregnancies such correction factors have not been fully elucidated. In vanishing twin pregnancies with a second gestational sac with a dead fetus, first-trimester screening should be based solely on the maternal age and the nuchal translucency scan as biomarkers are altered in these cases.

==== Advances in prenatal screening ====
Measurement of fetal proteins in maternal serum is a part of standard prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy and neural tube defects. Computational predictive model shows that extensive and diverse feto-maternal protein trafficking occurs during pregnancy and can be readily detected non-invasively in maternal whole blood. This computational approach circumvented a major limitation, the abundance of maternal proteins interfering with the detection of fetal proteins, to fetal proteomic analysis of maternal blood. Entering fetal gene transcripts previously identified in maternal whole blood into a computational predictive model helped develop a comprehensive proteomic network of the term neonate. It also shows that the fetal proteins detected in pregnant woman&#x27;s blood originate from a diverse group of tissues and organs from the developing fetus. Development proteomic networks dominate the functional characterization of the predicted proteins, illustrating the potential clinical application of this technology as a way to monitor normal and abnormal fetal development.

The difference in methylation of specific DNA sequences between mother and fetus can be used to identify fetal-specific DNA in the blood circulation of the mother. In a study published in the March 6, 2011, online issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, using this non-invasive technique a group of investigators from Greece and UK achieved correct diagnosis of 14 trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and 26 normal cases. Using massive parallel sequencing, a study testing for trisomy 21 only, successfully detected 209 of 212 cases (98.6%) with 3 false-positives in 1,471 pregnancies (0.2%). With commercially available non-invasive (blood) testing for Down syndrome having become available to patients in the United States and already available in China, in October 2011, the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis created some guidance. Based on its sensitivity and specificity, it constitutes an advanced screening test and that positive results require confirmation by an invasive test, and that while effective in the diagnosis of Down syndrome, it cannot assess half the abnormalities detected by invasive testing. The test is not recommended for general use until results from broader studies have been reported, but may be useful in high-risk patients in conjunction with genetic counseling.

A study in 2012 found that the maternal plasma cell-free DNA test was also able to detect trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) in 100% of the cases (59/59) at a false-positive rate of 0.28%, and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) in 91.7% of the cases (11/12) at a false-positive rate of 0.97%. The test interpreted 99.1% of samples (1,971/1,988); among the 17 samples without an interpretation, three were trisomy 18. The study stated that if z-score cutoffs for trisomy 18 and 13 were raised slightly, the overall false-positive rates for the three aneuploidies could be as low as 0.1% (2/1,688) at an overall detection rate of 98.9% (280/283) for common aneuploidies (this includes all three trisomies: Down, Edwards and Patau).

=== Prenatal genetic testing ===

The goal of prenatal genetic testing is to identify pregnancies at high risk of abnormalities, allowing for early intervention, termination or appropriate management and preparation measures. Prenatal genetic testing can be subdivided into two categories: screening and diagnostic testing. Screening informs an individual of the potential for certain abnormalities occurring, whereas, diagnostic testing is used to confirm/diagnose that specific abnormalities exist within the fetus. Prenatal screens are typically less invasive than prenatal diagnostic tests. Screening comes with much lower risks, however, the results are not as definitive as diagnostic tests. Providers often recommend following up with a diagnostic test upon receipt of a positive result from a specific screen.

Medically invasive techniques are those in which a tool is used to access something inside the body. There are varying degrees of invasiveness, depending on what specimen is required to complete the test. The typical blood draw administered by a healthcare professional is one of the most common invasive medical practices. Since it causes minimal discomfort and there is very low risk associated with the sample collection, a blood draw is considered less invasive. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and Amniocentesis are the most invasive prenatal tests because there is greater associated risk and the sample is more difficult to access. These procedures are done via needle insertion into the abdomen to collect a sample within the uterus, meaning exceptional care/precision is required.
Prenatal genetic testing can identify various chromosomal abnormalities, autosomal conditions, various birth defects, and some fetal blood disorders.

Chromosomal abnormalities are when the chromosomes differ in either structure or number when compared to a typical reference genome. This includes chromosomal deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.  Some examples of chromosomal abnormalities include:
* Down syndrome (trisomy 21)
* Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)
* Patau syndrome (trisomy 13)
* Turner syndrome (monosomy X)
* Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)
* Trisomy X (XXX)
* Jacobs syndrome (XYY)
* Pallister–Killian syndrome
* Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome
* Cri-du-chat syndrome
* WAGR syndrome
* DiGeorge syndrome
* Fragile X syndrome
– Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome

Autosomal recessive conditions occur when both parents pass on a mutation within an autosomal (non-sex) chromosome.  Some examples of autosomal recessive conditions are:
* Cystic fibrosis
* Sickle cell anemia
* Tay–Sachs disease
* Spinal muscular atrophy
* Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
* Phenylketonuria

Neural tube defects are a type of birth defect that occurs when the neural tube of a fetus does not form/close properly, potentially effecting other systems throughout the body.  Some examples of neural tube defects are:
* Spina bifida
* Anencephaly
* Encephalocele
* Tethered spinal cord syndrome

Abdominal wall defects are a type of birth defect that occur when the abdominal wall of a fetus does not form properly, potentially effecting other organs throughout the body.  Some examples of abdominal wall defects are:
* Gastroschisis
* Omphalocele
* Bladder exstrophy
* Cloacal exstrophy
* Ectopia cordis
* Pentalogy of Cantrell
* Body-stalk anomaly

Blood disorders can occur from a negative interaction between the maternal blood and the fetal blood. An example of a fetal blood disorder is Hemolytic disease of the fetus.

=== Ultrasound imaging and serum markers as indications for genetic testing ===
Ultrasound imaging provides the opportunity to conduct a nuchal translucency (NT) scan screening for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). Using the information from the NT scan the mother can be offered an invasive diagnostic test for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Serum markers are used in a similar fashion to identify gestations that should be recommended for further testing. When the NT scan or serum markers arouse suspicion for chromosomal abnormalities the following genetic tests may be conducted on fetal or placental tissue samples: Interphase-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative PCR and direct preparation of chromosomes from chorionic villi.

=== Screens ===

====Carrier screening  ====
Carrier screening is a general DNA test that uses a blood or cheek swab sample to determine if the parents carry certain genetic conditions. This test can be done anytime, whether the individual(s) are considering starting a family or have already become pregnant. Various types of carrier screens are available that test for progressively more genetic abnormalities. The single gene/condition screen will test for a specific condition, whereas, the expanded carrier screen will test for hundreds of different abnormalities that can be inherited by a fetus. There are also three gene/condition and ethnic specific carrier tests. In the case of a positive test result, further testing is often recommended, as the carrier test only determines if the parent(s) is a carrier, not if the gene has definitively been passed to the fetus.

==== Placental acellular DNA (pa-DNA) ====
Placental acellular (fetal cell-free) DNA testing (pa-DNA) allows for the detection of apoptotic placental cells and placental DNA circulating in maternal blood for the noninvasive diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy. A meta-analysis that investigated the success rate of using placental acellular DNA from maternal blood to screen for aneuploidies found that this technique detected trisomy 13 in 99% of the cases, trisomy 18 in 98% of the cases and trisomy 21 in 99% of the cases. Failed tests using placental acellular DNA are more likely to occur in fetuses with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 but not with trisomy 21. Previous studies found elevated levels of acellular placental DNA for trisomy 13 and 21 from maternal serum when compared to women with euploid pregnancies. However, an elevation of acellular DNA for trisomy 18 was not observed. Circulating placental nucleated cells comprise only three to six percent of maternal blood plasma DNA, reducing the detection rate of fetal developmental abnormalities. Two alternative approaches have been developed for the detection of fetal aneuploidy. The first involves the measuring of the allelic ratio of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mRNA coding region in the placenta. The next approach is analyzing both maternal and placental DNA and looking for differences in the DNA methylation patterns.

==== First/Second/Third trimester Screen ====
The first, second, combined, and third trimester screens typically consist of an ultrasound (abdominal and/or transvaginal) and maternal blood/serum testing. The ultrasound is used to visually assess the growth, development, and activity of the fetus through imaging observations and measurements. The ultrasound portion of the first trimester screen can include a nuchal translucency screen and a fetal nasal bone determination screen. The available blood tests from the first trimester screen can test for plasma protein A and human chorionic gonadotropin. The second trimester screen looks at specific blood markers, to include the estriol, inhibin and human chorionic gonadotropin hormones and often consists of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening. Any abnormal results from these screening tests can indicate the possibility of abnormal conditions such as Trisomy 18, Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), and spina bifida.

==== Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)/multiple marker test ====
The AFP test is often done in the second trimester using the serum from the maternal blood draw. This test looks at a specific protein that is formed in the liver of the fetus and released into the fluid contents of the womb, which is then absorbed into the mother&#x27;s blood stream. Multiple determinations stem from the results of AFP testing. Genetically, it can expose chromosomal and neural defects.

=== Diagnostic tests ===

==== Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) ====
CVS is an invasive diagnostic test that can be done during the first trimester of pregnancy for individuals that are looking to identify or are at higher risk of passing chromosomal abnormalities. A tissue cell sample of the placenta is obtained abdominally via needle or via vaginal insertion of a catheter/syringe into the cervix in combination with ultrasound to guide the procedure. Positive results from CVS require blood testing for confirmation.

==== Amniocentesis ====
Amniocentesis is an invasive diagnostic test that can be done during the second trimester of pregnancy for individuals that are looking to identify or are at higher risk of passing chromosomal and/or neural tube abnormalities. The procedure is typically done via needle, in combination with ultrasound for guidance, to obtain a sample of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus.

==== Cordocentesis/Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) ====
PUBS is an invasive diagnostic test that can be done during the second trimester of pregnancy for individuals that are looking to identify or are at higher risk of passing chromosomal and/or blood abnormalities. The demand for cordocentesis tests is diminishing because it has been replaced with CVS and Amniocentesis, which carry less risk. The procedure is typically done via needle into the mother&#x27;s abdomen, in combination with ultrasound for guidance, to obtain a blood sample from the umbilical cord of the fetus.

== Prenatal genetic testing analysis techniques ==

=== Digital PCR ===
Recently, it has been proposed that digital PCR analysis can be conducted on fetal cell-free DNA for detection of fetal aneuploidy. Research has shown that digital PCR can be used to differentiate between normal and aneuploid DNA.

A variation of the PCR technique called multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), targeting DNA, has been successively applied for diagnosing fetal aneuploidy as a chromosome- or gene-specific assay.

=== Shotgun sequencing ===
Fetal cell-free DNA has been directly sequenced using shotgun sequencing technology. In one study, DNA was obtained from the blood plasma of eighteen pregnant women. This was followed by mapping the chromosome using the quantification of fragments. This was done using advanced methods in DNA sequencing resulting in the parallel sequencing of the fetal DNA. The amount of sequence tags mapped to each chromosome was counted. If there was a surplus or deficiency in any of the chromosomes, this meant that there was a fetal aneuploid. Using this method of shotgun sequencing, the successful identification of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome), and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) was possible. This method of noninvasive diagnosis is now starting to be heavily used and researched further.

=== Other techniques ===
Microarray analysis, karyotyping, and different genome sequencing techniques are also used to detect abnormalities. Fetal components in samples from maternal blood plasma can be analyzed by genome-wide techniques not only by total DNA, but also by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (with tiling array), microRNA (such as with Megaplex) and total RNA (RNA-sequencing).

==By invasiveness==

Diagnostic prenatal testing can be performed by invasive or non-invasive methods. An invasive method involves probes or needles being inserted into the uterus, e.g. amniocentesis, which can be done from about 14 weeks gestation, and usually up to about 20 weeks, and chorionic villus sampling, which can be done earlier (between 9.5 and 12.5 weeks gestation) but which may be slightly more risky to the fetus. One study comparing transabdominal chorionic villus sampling with second trimester amniocentesis found no significant difference in the total pregnancy loss between the two procedures. However, transcervical chorionic villus sampling carries a significantly higher risk, compared with a second-trimester amniocentesis, of total pregnancy loss (relative risk 1.40; 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.81) and spontaneous miscarriage (9.4% risk; relative risk 1.50; 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.11).

Non-invasive techniques include examinations of the woman&#x27;s womb through ultrasonography and maternal serum screens (i.e. Alpha-fetoprotein). Blood tests for select trisomies (Down syndrome in the United States, Down and Edwards syndromes in China) based on detecting cell-free placental DNA present in maternal blood, also known as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), have become available. If an elevated risk of chromosomal or genetic abnormality is indicated by a non-invasive screening test, a more invasive technique may be employed to gather more information. In the case of neural tube defects, a detailed ultrasound can non-invasively provide a definitive diagnosis.

One of the major advantages of the non-invasive prenatal testing is that the chance of a false positive result is very low. This accuracy is very important for the pregnant woman, as due to a high sensitivity and specificity of the testing, especially for Down syndrome, the invasive testing could be avoided, which includes the risk of a miscarriage.

=== Testing guidelines and qualifying risk factors for invasive testing ===
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines currently recommend that anyone who is pregnant, regardless of age, should discuss and be offered non-invasive prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing options. Non-invasive prenatal genetic screening is typically performed at the end of the 1st trimester (11–14 weeks) or during the beginning of the second trimester (15–20 weeks). This involves the pregnant woman receiving a blood draw with a needle and a syringe and an ultrasound of the fetus. Screening tests can then include serum analyte screening or cell-free fetal DNA, and nuchal translucency ultrasound [NT], respectively. It is important to note that screening tests are not diagnostic, and concerning screening results should be followed up with invasive diagnostic testing for a confirmed diagnosis. Invasive diagnostic prenatal genetic testing can involve chronic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis. The ACOG recommends genetic screening before pregnancy to all pregnant women planning to have a family. After comprehensive counseling and discussion that acknowledges residual risks, it is important to respect the patients&#x27; right of choosing whether or not to pursue any component of genetic testing.

The following are some reasons why a woman might consider her risk of birth defects already to be high enough to warrant skipping screening and going straight for invasive testing:
* Increased risk of fetal aneuploidy based on personal obstetric history or family history affected by aneuploidy
* Increased risk for a known genetic or biochemical disease of the fetus
* Maternal transmissible infectious disease such as rubella or toxoplasma
* Parental request in the context of acute parental anxiety or under exceptional circumstances

====Patient acceptance====
Research was conducted to determine how women felt about noninvasive diagnosis of fetal aneuploid using maternal blood. This study was conducted using surveys. It was reported that eighty-two percent of pregnant women and seventy-nine percent of female medical students view this type of diagnosis in a positive light, agreeing that it is important for prenatal care. Overall, women responded optimistically that this form of diagnosis will be available in the future.

==By pregnancy stage==

=== Pre-conception ===
Prior to conception, couples may elect to have genetic testing done to determine the odds of conceiving a child with a known genetic anomaly. The most common in the Caucasian population are:
* Cystic fibrosis
* Fragile X syndrome
* Blood disorders such as sickle cell disease
* Tay-Sachs disease
* Spinal muscular atrophy
Hundreds of additional conditions are known and more discovered on a regular basis. However the economic justification for population-wide testing of all known conditions is not well supported, particularly once the cost of possible false positive results and concomitant follow-up testing are taken into account. There are also ethical concerns related to this or any type of genetic testing.

One or both partners may be aware of other family members with these diseases. Testing prior to conception may alleviate concern, prepare the couple for the potential short- or long-term consequences of having a child with the disease, direct the couple toward adoption or foster parenting, or prompt for preimplantation genetic testing during &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization. If a genetic disorder is found, professional genetic counseling is usually recommended owing to the host of ethical considerations related to subsequent decisions for the partners and potential impact on their extended families. Most, but not all, of these diseases follow Mendelian inheritance patterns. Fragile X syndrome is related to expansion of certain repeated DNA segments and may change generation-to-generation.

=== First trimester ===
At early presentation of pregnancy at around 6 weeks, early dating ultrasound scan may be offered to help confirm the gestational age of the embryo and check for a single or twin pregnancy, but such a scan is unable to detect common abnormalities. Details of prenatal screening and testing options may be provided.

Around weeks 11–13, nuchal translucency scan (NT) may be offered which can be combined with blood tests for PAPP-A and beta-hCG, two serum markers that correlate with chromosomal abnormalities, in what is called the First Trimester Combined Test. The results of the blood test are then combined with the NT ultrasound measurements, maternal age, and gestational age of the fetus to yield a risk score for Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13. First Trimester Combined Test has a sensitivity (i.e. detection rate for abnormalities) of 82–87% and a false-positive rate of around 5%.

Cell-free fetal DNA is also available during the first trimester of pregnancy.

=== Second trimester ===
The anomaly scan is performed between 18 and 22 weeks of gestational age. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that this ultrasound is performed as a matter of routine prenatal care, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy, and to assess for congenital malformations and multiple pregnancies (i.e. twins). The scan can detect anencephaly, open spina bifida, cleft lip, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, omphalocele, congenital heart defect, bilateral renal agenesis, osteochondrodysplasia, Edwards syndrome, and Patau syndrome.

A second-trimester Quad blood test may be taken (the Triple test is widely considered obsolete but in some states, such as Missouri, where Medicaid only covers the Triple test, that&#x27;s what the patient typically gets). With &quot;integrated screening&quot;, both a First Trimester Combined Test and a Triple/Quad test is performed, and a report is only produced after both tests have been analyzed. However patients may not wish to wait between these two sets of tests. With &quot;sequential screening&quot;, a first report is produced after the first trimester sample has been submitted, and a final report after the second sample. With &quot;contingent screening&quot;, patients at very high or very low risks will get reports after the first-trimester sample has been submitted. Only patients with &quot;moderate risk&quot; (risk score between 1:50 and 1:2000) will be asked to submit a second-trimester sample, after which they will receive a report combining information from both serum samples and the NT measurement. The First Trimester Combined Test and the Triple/Quad test together have a sensitivity of 88–95% with a 5% false-positive rate for Down syndrome, though they can also be analyzed in such a way as to offer a 90% sensitivity with a 2% false-positive rate. Finally, patients who do not receive an NT ultrasound in the 1st trimester may still receive a Serum Integrated test involving measuring PAPP-A serum levels in the 1st trimester and then doing a Quad test in the 2nd trimester. This offers an 85–88% sensitivity and 5% false-positive rate for Down syndrome. Also, a patient may skip the 1st-trimester screening entirely and receive only a 2nd-trimester Quad test, with an 81% sensitivity for Down syndrome and 5% false-positive rate.

=== Third trimester ===
Third-trimester prenatal testing generally focuses on maternal wellbeing and reducing fetal morbidity/mortality. Group B streptococcal infection (also called Group B strep) may be offered, which is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Group B strep is an infection that may be passed to an infant during birth. Vaginal screening for GBS is performed between 34 and 37 weeks of gestational age, so that mothers that are positive for the bacterium can receive treatment before delivery. During the third trimester, some institutions may require evaluations of hemoglobin/hematocrit, syphilis serology, and HIV screening. Also, before delivery, an assessment of fetal position and estimated fetal weight is documented.

== Legislation ==

=== In Europe ===
Prenatal diagnosis (DPN) is permitted throughout Europe, with the exception of Ireland. Eight (8) countries have no legislation on this matter. However, there are differences between states. For instance, in Poland, the deadline for DPN is 22 weeks. In Malta, the Parliamentary Social Affairs Committee specified in its 2005 report that DPN should only be allowed for conditions for which therapeutic options exist. Nevertheless, all countries prohibit DPN for non-medical purposes (such as sex selection), for example.

=== In France ===
Article L2131-1 of the Public Health Code, stemming from the July 2011 bioethics law, states that &quot;prenatal diagnosis refers to medical practices, including obstetric and fetal ultrasound, aimed at detecting, in utero, a particularly severe condition in the embryo or fetus.&quot; The law requires that pregnant women receive clear information about these techniques to &quot;assess the risk that the embryo or fetus may have a condition that could alter the course or management of the pregnancy.

==Ethical and practical issues==
=== Non-genetic prenatal testing ===
Parents need to make informed decisions about screening, diagnosis, and any actions to be taken as a result. Many screening tests are inaccurate, so one worrisome test result frequently leads to additional, more invasive tests. If prenatal testing confirms a serious disability, many parents are forced to decide whether to continue the pregnancy or seek an abortion. The &quot;option&quot; of screening becomes an unexpected requirement to decide. 

In some genetic conditions, for instance cystic fibrosis, an abnormality can only be detected if DNA is obtained from the fetus. Usually an invasive method is needed to do this.

Ultrasound of a fetus, which is considered a screening test, can sometimes miss subtle abnormalities. For example, studies show that a detailed 2nd-trimester ultrasound, also called a level 2 ultrasound, can detect about 97% of neural tube defects such as spina bifida . Ultrasound results may also show &quot;soft signs,&quot; such as an Echogenic intracardiac focus or a Choroid plexus cyst, which are usually normal, but can be associated with an increased risk for chromosome abnormalities.

Other screening tests, such as the Quad test, can also have false positives and false negatives. Even when the Quad results are positive (or, to be more precise, when the Quad test yields a score that shows at least a 1 in 270 risk of abnormality), usually the pregnancy is normal, but additional diagnostic tests are offered. In fact, consider that Down syndrome affects about 1:400 pregnancies; if you screened 4000 pregnancies with a Quad test, there would probably be 10 Down syndrome pregnancies of which the Quad test, with its 80% sensitivity, would call 8 of them high-risk. The quad test would also tell 5% (~200) of the 3990 normal women that they are high-risk. Therefore, about 208 women would be told they are high-risk, but when they undergo an invasive test, only 8 (or 4% of the high risk pool) will be confirmed as positive and 200 (96%) will be told that their pregnancies are normal. Since amniocentesis has approximately a 0.5% chance of miscarriage, one of those 200 normal pregnancies might result in a miscarriage because of the invasive procedure. Meanwhile, of the 3792 women told they are low-risk by the Quad test, 2 of them will go on to deliver a baby with Down syndrome. The Quad test is therefore said to have a 4% positive predictive value (PPV) because only 4% of women who are told they are &quot;high-risk&quot; by the screening test actually have an affected fetus. The other 96% of the women who are told they are &quot;high-risk&quot; find out that their pregnancy is normal.

By comparison, in the same 4000 women, a screening test that has a 99% sensitivity and a 0.5% false positive rate would detect all 10 positives while telling 20 normal women that they are positive. Therefore, 30 women would undergo a confirmatory invasive procedure and 10 of them (33%) would be confirmed as positive and 20 would be told that they have a normal pregnancy. Of the 3970 women told by the screen that they are negative, none of the women would have an affected pregnancy. Therefore, such a screen would have a 33% positive predictive value.

The real-world false-positive rate for the Quad test (as well as 1st Trimester Combined, Integrated, etc.) is greater than 5%. 5% was the rate quoted in the large clinical studies that were done by the best researchers and physicians, where all the ultrasounds were done by well-trained sonographers and the gestational age of the fetus was calculated as closely as possible. In the real world, where calculating gestational age may be a less precise art, the formulas that generate a patient&#x27;s risk score are not as accurate and the false-positive rate can be higher, even 10%.

Because of the low accuracy of conventional screening tests, 5–10% of women, often those who are older, will opt for an invasive test even if they received a low-risk score from the screening. A patient who received a 1:330 risk score, while technically low-risk (since the cutoff for high-risk is commonly quoted as 1:270), might be more likely to still opt for a confirmatory invasive test. On the other hand, a patient who receives a 1:1000 risk score is more likely to feel assuaged that her pregnancy is normal.

Both false positives and false negatives will have a large impact on a couple when they are told the result, or when the child is born. Diagnostic tests, such as amniocentesis, are considered to be very accurate for the defects they check for, though even these tests are not perfect, with a reported 0.2% error rate (often due to rare abnormalities such as mosaic Down syndrome where only some of the fetal/placental cells carry the genetic abnormality).

A higher maternal serum AFP level indicates a greater risk for anencephaly and open spina bifida. This screening is 80% and 90% sensitive for spina bifida and anencephaly, respectively.

Amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase and AFP level are more sensitive and specific than AFP in predicting neural tube defects.

Many maternal-fetal specialists do not bother to even do an AFP test on their patients because they do a detail ultrasound on all of them in the 2nd trimester, which has a 97% detection rate for neural tube defects such as anencephaly and open spina bifida. Performing tests to determine possible birth defects is mandatory in all U.S. states. Failure to detect issues early can have dangerous consequences on both the mother and the baby. OBGYNs may be held culpable. In one case a man who was born with spina bifida was awarded $2 million in settlement, apart from medical expenses, due to the OBGYN&#x27;s negligence in conducting AFP tests.

No prenatal test can detect &quot;all&quot; forms of birth defects and abnormalities.

=== Prenatal genetic testing ===
Another important issue is the uncertainty of prenatal genetic testing. Uncertainty on genetic testing results from several reasons: the genetic test is associated with a disease but the prognosis and/or probability is unknown, the genetic test provides information different than the familiar disease they tested for, found genetic variants have unknown significance, and finally, results may not be associated with found fetal abnormalities. Richardson and Ormond thoroughly addressed the issue of uncertainty of genetic testing and explained its implication for bioethics. First, the principle of beneficence is assumed in prenatal testing by decreasing the risk of miscarriage, however, uncertain information derived from genetic testing may harm the parents by provoking anxiety and leading to the termination of a fetus that is probably healthy. Second, the principle of autonomy is undermined given a lack of comprehension resulting from new technologies and changing knowledge in the field of genetics. And third, the principle of justice raised issues regarding equal access to emerging prenatal tests.

=== Availability of treatments ===
If a genetic disease is detected, there is often no treatment that can help the fetus until it is born. However, in the US, there are prenatal surgeries for spina bifida fetus. Early diagnosis gives the parents time to research and discuss post-natal treatment and care, or in some cases, abortion. Genetic counselors are usually called upon to help families make informed decisions regarding results of prenatal diagnosis.

=== Patient education ===
Researchers have studied how disclosing amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling (CVS) results on a fixed date versus a variable date (i.e. &quot;when available&quot;) affects maternal anxiety. Systematic review of the relevant articles found no conclusive evidence to support issuing amniocentesis results as soon as they become available (in comparison to issuing results on a pre-defined fixed date). The researchers concluded that further studies evaluating the effect of different strategies for disclosing CVS results on maternal anxiety are needed.

=== Concerns from disability rights activists and scholars ===
Disability rights activists and scholars have suggested a more critical view of prenatal testing and its implications for people with disabilities. They argue that there is pressure to abort fetuses that might be born with disabilities, and that these pressures rely on eugenics interests and ableist stereotypes. This selective abortion relies on the ideas that people with disabilities cannot live desirable lives, that they are &quot;defective,&quot; and that they are burdens, while disability scholars argue that &quot;oppression is what&#x27;s most disabling about disability.&quot; Marsha Saxton suggests that women should question whether or not they are relying on real, factual information about people with disabilities or on stereotypes if they decide to abort a fetus with a disability.

===Societal pressures===
Amniocentesis has become the standard of care for prenatal care visits for women who are &quot;at risk&quot; or over a certain age. The wide use of amniocentesis has been defined as consumeristic. and some argue that this can be in conflict with the right to privacy, Most obstetricians (depending on the country) offer patients the AFP triple test, HIV test, and ultrasounds routinely. However, almost all women meet with a genetic counselor before deciding whether to have prenatal diagnosis. It is the role of the genetic counselor to accurately inform women of the risks and benefits of prenatal diagnosis. Genetic counselors are trained to be non-directive and to support the patient&#x27;s decision. Some doctors do advise women to have certain prenatal tests and the patient&#x27;s partner may also influence the woman&#x27;s decision.

<text>The Horseshoe Curve is a three-track railroad curve on Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Pittsburgh Line in Blair County, Pennsylvania. The curve is roughly long and in diameter. Completed in 1854 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as a way to reduce the westbound grade to the summit of the Allegheny Mountains, it replaced the time-consuming Allegheny Portage Railroad, which was the only other route across the mountains for large vehicles. The curve was later owned and used by three Pennsylvania Railroad successors: Penn Central, Conrail, and Norfolk Southern. 

Horseshoe Curve has long been a tourist attraction. A trackside observation park was completed in 1879. The park was renovated and a visitor center built in the early 1990s. The Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages the center, which has exhibits pertaining to the curve. The Horseshoe Curve was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1966. It became a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2004.

== Location and design ==

Horseshoe Curve is west of Altoona, Pennsylvania, in Logan Township, Blair County. It sits at railroad milepost 242 on the Pittsburgh Line, which is the Norfolk Southern Railway Pittsburgh Division main line between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Horseshoe Curve bends around a dam and lake, the highest of three Altoona Water Authority reservoirs that supply water from the valley to the city. It spans two ravines formed by creeks: Kittanning Run, on the north side of the valley, and Glenwhite Run, on the south. The Blair County Veterans Memorial Highway (SR 4008) follows the valley west from Altoona and tunnels under the curve. 

Westbound trains climb a maximum grade of 1.85 percent for from Altoona to Gallitzin. Just west of the Gallitzin Tunnels, trains pass the summit of the Allegheny Mountains, then descend for to Johnstown on a grade of 1.1 percent or less. The overall grade of the curve was listed by the Pennsylvania Railroad as 1.45 percent; it is listed as 1.34 percent by Norfolk Southern. The curve is long and about across at its widest. For every , the tracks at the Horseshoe Curve bend 9 degrees 15 arc minutes, with the entire curve totaling 220 degrees.

The rise of a westbound train through the curve can be described in several ways. One measurement is from the point where the rails north of the curve start to bow out to a point on the line directly south, across the original Kittanning Reservoir: across this north–south distance of , a train rises from above sea level to .
Another measurement is from the point where the rails coming west out of Altoona make their first detour north to the curve, to a point across Lake Altoona where the rails begin their one-mile straight run south before turning west to the Gallitzin Tunnels; this measurement encompasses the entire Curve structure, including both reservoirs built in its bounds to protect the curve from flooding. Across this north-south distance of , a westbound train rises from to . This latter rise—133 vertical feet in 1,006 linear feet—is a 13.2% grade, completely unascendable by conventional railroads, which usually stick to grades of 2.2% or less.

Each track consists of , welded rail. Before dieselization and the introduction of dynamic braking and rail oilers, the rails along the curve were transposed—left to right and vice versa—to equalize the wear on each rail from the flanges of passing steam locomotives and rail cars, thereby extending their life.

== History ==

===Origin===
In 1834, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania built the Allegheny Portage Railroad across the Allegheny Mountains to connect Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, as part of the Main Line of Public Works. The Portage Railroad was a series of canals and inclined planes and remained in use until the mid-19th century. The Pennsylvania Railroad was incorporated in 1847 to build a railroad from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, replacing the cumbersome Portage Railroad.

Using surveys completed in 1842, the state&#x27;s engineers recommended an route west from Lewistown that followed the ridges with a maximum grade of 0.852 percent. But the Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad, John Edgar Thomson, chose a route on lower, flatter terrain along the Juniata River and accepted a steeper grade west of Altoona. The valley west of Altoona was split into two ravines by a mountain; surveys had already found a route with an acceptable grade east from Gallitzin to the south side of the valley, and the proposed Horseshoe Curve would allow the same grade to continue to Altoona. 

=== Construction ===

Work on Horseshoe Curve began in 1850. It was done without heavy equipment, only men &quot;with picks and shovels, horses and drags&quot;. Engineers built an earth fill over the first ravine encountered while ascending, formed by Kittanning Run, cut the point of the mountain between the ravines, and filled in the second ravine, formed by Glenwhite Run. The line between Altoona and Johnstown, including Horseshoe Curve, opened on February 15, 1854. The total cost was $2,495,000 or $80,225 per mile ($49,850 /km). 

In 1879, the remaining part of the mountain inside the curve was leveled to allow the construction of a park and observation area—the first built for viewing trains. As demand for train travel increased, a third track was added to the curve in 1898 and a fourth was added two years later.

From around the 1860s to just before World War II, passengers could ride to the PRR&#x27;s Kittanning Point station near the curve. Two branch railroads connected to the main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. In the early 1900s, locomotives could take on fuel and water at a coal trestle on a spur track across from the station. 

A reservoir was built at the apex of the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. A third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.

Horseshoe Curve was depicted in brochures, calendars and other promotional material; Pennsylvania Railroad stock certificates were printed with a vignette of it. The Pennsylvania pitted the scenery of Horseshoe Curve against rival New York Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Water Level Route&quot; during the 1890s. A raised-relief, scale model of the curve was included as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s exhibit at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Pennsylvania Railroad conductors were told to announce the Horseshoe Curve to daytime passengers—a tradition that continues aboard Amtrak trains.
=== World War II and post-war ===

During World War II, the PRR carried troops and materiel for the Allied war effort, and the curve was under armed guard. The military intelligence arm of Nazi Germany, the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, plotted to sabotage important industrial assets in the United States in a project code-named Operation Pastorius. In June 1942, four men were brought by submarine and landed on Long Island, planning to destroy such sites as the curve, Hell Gate Bridge, Alcoa aluminum factories and locks on the Ohio River. The would-be saboteurs were quickly apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after one, George John Dasch, turned himself in. All but Dasch and one other would-be saboteur were executed as spies and saboteurs.

Train count peaked in the 1940s with over 50 passenger trains per day, along with many freight and military trains. Demand for train travel dropped greatly after World War II, as highway and air travel became popular. 

During the 1954 celebration of the centennial of the opening of Horseshoe Curve, a night photo was arranged by Sylvania Electric Products using 6,000 flashbulbs and of wiring to illuminate the area. The event also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb. Pennsylvania steam locomotive 1361 was placed at the park inside the Horseshoe Curve on June 8, 1957. It is one of 425 K4s-class engines: the principal passenger locomotives on the Pennsylvania Railroad that regularly plied the curve. The Horseshoe Curve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966. The operation of the observation park was transferred to the city of Altoona the same year. The Pennsylvania Railroad was combined with the New York Central Railroad in 1968. The merger created Penn Central, which went bankrupt in 1970 and was taken over by the federal government in 1976, as part of the merger that created Conrail. The second track from the inside at the Horseshoe Curve was removed by Conrail in 1981. The K4s 1361 was removed from the curve for a restoration to working order in September 1985 and was replaced with the ex-Conrail EMD GP9 diesel-electric locomotive 7048 that was repainted into a Pennsylvania Railroad scheme.

Starting in June 1990, the park at the Horseshoe Curve underwent a $5.8 million renovation funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and by the National Park Service through its &quot;America&#x27;s Industrial Heritage Project&quot;. The renovations were completed in April 1992 with the dedication of a new visitor center. In 1999, Conrail was divided between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern, with the Horseshoe Curve being acquired by the latter. The Horseshoe Curve was lit up again with fireworks and rail-borne searchlights during its in 2004 in homage to the 1954 celebrations. It was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2004.

==Current operations==

The curve remains busy as part of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Pittsburgh Line: , it was passed by 51 scheduled freight trains each day, not including locals and helper engines, which can double the number. Coupled to the rear of long trains, helper engines add power going up and help to brake coming down. For some years before 2020, Norfolk Southern used SD40Es as helpers; since then, EMD SD70ACU locomotives are used. In 2012, Norfolk Southern said annual traffic passing Horseshoe Curve was , including locomotives. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; between Pittsburgh and New York City rounds the curve once each way daily. Maximum speeds for trains at Horseshoe Curve are for freight and about for passenger trains. 

== Trackside attractions ==
The Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages a visitor center next to the curve. The center has historical artifacts and memorabilia relating to the curve and a raised-relief map of the Altoona–Johnstown area. Access to the curve is by a funicular or a 194-step stairway. The funicular is single-tracked, with the cars passing each other halfway up the slope; the cars are painted to resemble Pennsylvania Railroad passenger cars. A former &quot;watchman&#x27;s shanty&quot; is in the park. 

Horseshoe Curve is popular with railfans; watchers can sometimes see three trains passing at once. In August 2012, the former Nickel Plate Road (NKP) steam locomotive No. 765 traversed Horseshoe Curve: the first steam locomotive to do so since 1977, while deadheading to and from Harrisburg as part of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s 21st Century Steam program. NKP 765 returned to the curve in May 2013 with public excursion trains from Lewistown to Gallitzin.

<text>Vallès Oriental () is a comarca (county) in the Barcelona region in Catalonia (Spain). Its capital is Granollers. Along with Vallès Occidental it forms the historical Vallès region.

In May 2015, Vallès Oriental lost four municipalities - Castellcir, Castellterçol, Granera, Sant Quirze Safaja - to the new comarca of Moianès.

== Municipalities ==
== Vegetation ==
The natural vegetation of Vallès Oriental is typically Mediterranean, with a predominance of Holm oak, cork oak, and Aleppo pine. There are some oaks (in the narrow sense of the word) at Montnegre and Montseny. The latter also features European beech and silver fir woods.

<doc id="647295" wikidata="Q7875319" url="?curid=647295" title="USS Wasp (1807)">
<text>USS &quot;Wasp&quot; of the United States Navy was a sailing sloop-of-war captured by the British in the early months of the War of 1812. She was constructed in 1806 at the Washington Navy Yard, was commissioned sometime in 1807, Master Commandant John Smith in command. In 1812 she captured , but was immediately herself captured. The British took her into service first as HMS &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; and then as HMS &quot;Peacock&quot;. She was lost, presumed foundered with all hands, in mid-1814.

==US Service==
In 1808 &quot;Wasp&quot; was heavily involved in supporting Jefferson&#x27;s Embargo, including delivering an army garrison from New York City to Passamaquoddy in June, patrolling Casco Bay, Maine, in the winter of 1808–1809, and remaining at Portland until May, 1809. Until 1809 she was commanded by Master Commandant John Smith. In the final weeks of 1810, she was operating from the ports of Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, presumably patrolling the waters along southern Atlantic coast. In 1811, she sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she and the brig joined frigates and in forming a squadron commanded by Commodore Stephen Decatur.

On 9 March 1812 &quot;Wasp&quot; sailed from New York for France to deliver an Anglo-Irish mercenary named John Henry who had sold intelligence to President Madison indicating Britain&#x27;s interest in determining if the New England states wished to secede from the union. The correspondence, known as the Henry Papers, helped build outrage in Congress against Britain that led to the declaration of war, however the documents are now widely believed to have been a forgery.

&quot;Wasp&quot;, under the command of Master Commandant Jacob Jones continued to operate along the coast of the middle states after the United States went to war with Britain in June 1812. On 13 October, she sailed from the Delaware River, two days later she encountered a heavy gale that tore away her jib boom and washed two crewmen overboard. The following evening, &quot;Wasp&quot; encountered a squadron of ships and, in spite of the fact that two of their number appeared to be large men-of-war, made for them straight away. She finally caught the enemy convoy the following morning and discovered six merchantmen under the protection of a 22-gun sloop-of-war, HMS &quot;Frolic&quot;.

At half past eleven in the morning of 18 October, &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Frolic&quot; closed to do battle. The engagement would be the first and only time &quot;Wasp&quot; saw combat. The two ships commenced fire at a distance of . In a short, sharp, fight, both ships sustained heavy damage to masts and rigging, but &quot;Wasp&quot; prevailed over her adversary by boarding her. The victory was short lived however. Unfortunately for &quot;Wasp&quot;, a British 74-gun ship-of-the-line, , appeared on the scene. &quot;Frolic&quot; was crippled and &quot;Wasp″&quot;s rigging and sails were badly damaged. At 4:00 PM Jones had no choice but to surrender &quot;Wasp&quot;; he could neither run nor fight such an overwhelming opponent.

==British service==
&quot;Wasp&quot; was briefly given the name &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; on her capture. She was commissioned in 1813 on the Halifax station under Captain Charles Gill. Captain William William Mends succeeded Gill, taking command on 26 February 1813.

In June &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; was off New London, where she helped blockade the squadron under Commodore Stephen Decatur. James Biddle, who had been first lieutenant of &quot;Wasp&quot;, had become captain of . He issued a challenge to Mends that their two vessels meet in an engagement. Decatur forbade the engagement until he was sure that it would be an even match. The day after he gave his assent &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; left New London to patrol elsewhere.

Thereafter &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; captured or recaptured four vessels. On 27 June she captured the schooner &quot;Little Bill&quot;, John Roach master, which had been sailing from St Bartholomew to North Carolina. She was carrying a cargo of sugar and molasses. &quot;Little Bill&quot; was restored. Another report gives the vessel&#x27;s name as &quot;Little Bell&quot;.

Then on 28 August &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; captured the ship &quot;Hope&quot;, of 468 tons (bm), J. Emery master. &quot;Hope&quot; was sailing from Lisbon to Newport, Rhode Island, with a cargo of salt. She too was restored.

On 29 October &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; recaptured the brig &quot;John and Mary&quot;, T. Collins, master. Lastly, &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; was one of four British warships that shared in the capture of the sloop &quot;Emeline&quot;, of 44 tons (bm), O. Adams, master. &quot;Emeline&quot; was sailing from New York to Rhode Island with a cargo of 240 barrels of flour.

At some point &quot;Loup Cervier&quot; was renamed &quot;Peacock&quot;, &quot;Hornet&quot; having captured and sunk the in February 1813. Mends was appointed to command of on 23 March 1814. &quot;Peacock&quot; may then have been briefly under the command of Captain G. Donnett. In April or shortly thereafter Commander Richard Coote of was promoted to post captain and transferred to &quot;Peacock&quot;.

&quot;Peacock&quot; was one of the five British warships that on 21 April 1814 captured the Swedish brig &quot;Minerva&quot;. Then on 15 May, &quot;Peacock&quot; recaptured the Swedish ship &quot;Providentia&quot;, of four guns, 400 tons, and 17 men. She had been sailing from Amelia Island to Lisbon with a cargo of pine, cedar, etc. when an American privateer had captured her. That same day, &quot;Peacock&quot; recaptured the Russian ship &quot;Hendrick&quot;, of eight guns, 80 tons, and 13 men. She had been sailing from Amelia Island to Amsterdam with a cargo of pine and cotton when captured.

==Fate==
&quot;Peacock&quot; was under Coote&#x27;s command when she disappeared off the Virginia Capes. She apparently had foundered on 23 July 1814.

<doc id="647297" wikidata="Q644719" url="?curid=647297" title="Half-space (geometry)">
<text>In geometry, a half-space is either of the two parts into which a plane divides the three-dimensional Euclidean space. If the space is two-dimensional, then a half-space is called a &quot;half-plane&quot; (open or closed). A half-space in a one-dimensional space is called a &quot;half-line&quot; or ray&quot;.&quot;

More generally, a half-space is either of the two parts into which a hyperplane divides an n-dimensional space. That is, the points that are not incident to the hyperplane are partitioned into two convex sets (i.e., half-spaces), such that any subspace connecting a point in one set to a point in the other must intersect the hyperplane.

A half-space can be either &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;. An open half-space is either of the two open sets produced by the subtraction of a hyperplane from the affine space. A closed half-space is the union of an open half-space and the hyperplane that defines it.

The open (closed) &quot;upper half-space&quot; is the half-space of all (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) such that &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 (≥ 0). The open (closed) &quot;lower half-space&quot; is defined similarly, by requiring that &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; be negative (non-positive).

A half-space may be specified by a linear inequality, derived from the linear equation that specifies the defining hyperplane.
A strict linear inequality specifies an open half-space:
:formula_1
A non-strict one specifies a closed half-space:
:formula_2
Here, one assumes that not all of the real numbers &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; are zero.

A half-space is a convex set.

<text>HMS &quot;Achates&quot; was an destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the late 1920s. Completed in 1930, she initially served with the Mediterranean Fleet. She was sunk on 31 December 1942 during the Battle of the Barents Sea.

== Design and description ==
In the mid-1920s, the Royal Navy ordered two destroyers from two different builders, , built by Yarrow, and , built by Thornycroft, incorporating the lessons learned from World War I, as prototypes for future classes. The A-class destroyers were based on &quot;Amazon&quot;, slightly enlarged and carrying two more torpedo tubes. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . &quot;Acasta&quot; was powered by a pair of Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a speed of . During her sea trials, she reached a maximum speed of from . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The complement of the A-class ships was 134 officers and ratings and increased to 143 by 1940.

Their main armament consisted of four QF 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mk IX guns in single mounts, in two superfiring pairs in front of the bridge and aft of the superstructure. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on a platform between their funnels. The ships were fitted with two above-water quadruple mounts for  torpedoes. Carrying the minesweeping paravanes on the quarterdeck limited depth charge chutes to three with two depth charges provided for each chute. The A-class destroyers were given space for an ASDIC system, but it was not initially fitted.

===Modifications===
As a result of experience from the Norwegian campaign, the Royal Navy launched a programme of modifying its destroyers by adding high-angle anti-aircraft guns, with the A-class replacing the aft set of torpedo tubes with a single 12 pounder (3-inch (76mm)) gun, with all of the A-class modified by October 1940, although the lack of any fire control equipment meant that the gun was of limited use. Early in the Second World War, a depth charge outfit of 35 charges was carried, but this had increased to 42 charges, which could be dropped in a five-charge pattern, by April 1941. In late 1941, Y gun (the furthest aft 4.7-inch weapon) was removed to accommodate a heavier depth charge armament, with additional depth charge throwers and rails fitted to allow a ten-charge depth charge pattern to be dropped, with 60 depth charges carried, while A gun (the furthest forward 4.7-inch gun) was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon.

==Ship history==
&quot;Achates&quot; was ordered on 6 March 1928, and was laid down on 11 September 1928 at John Brown &amp; Company&#x27;s Clydebank shipyard, launched on 4 October 1929 and completed on 27 March 1930. Following commissioning, &quot;Achates&quot; joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Mediterranean Fleet. In early 1931, &quot;Achates&quot; accompanied the aircraft carrier on a visit to Buenos Aires, Argentina to support a British Empire Trade Exhibition, also visiting Montevideo and Rio de Janeiro. In October 1931, rioting in Cyprus led to the Royal Navy sending warships to the British protectorate, with &quot;Achates&quot;, sister ship and the cruisers and ordered to Cyprus from Crete on 22 October. On 4 April 1932, &quot;Achates&quot; and the destroyer collided off Saint-Tropez, with &quot;Active&quot; requiring repair at Malta. The ships of the 3rd Flotilla were refitted in British dockyards in the summer of 1932, with &quot;Achetes&quot; completing her refit at Devonport in October 1932, before returning to the Mediterranean, leaving for Gibraltar on 4 November 1932. The flotilla, including &quot;Achates&quot; again left the Mediterranean for home ports on 22 April 1935, with &quot;Achates&quot; recommissioning with a new crew at Devonport on 23 July before returning to the Mediterranean later that month, with the flotilla expected to work up and train at Gibraltar for a month before transferring to Malta.

On 13 January 1937, &quot;Achates&quot; collected the crew of the Spanish steamer &quot;Aragon&quot;, which had been seized by the in retaliation against Spanish Republican actions against the German ship &quot;Palos&quot;, and repatriated &quot;Aragon&quot;″s crew to Málaga. &quot;Achates&quot;, with the rest of the A-class, which was replaced in the 3rd Flotilla by the ships of the I-class, returned to Britain in March 1937 and was paid off at Devonport. In October 1937, &quot;Achates&quot; replaced the destroyer as parent ship of the 1st Anti-Submarine Flotilla based at Portland. In July 1938, &quot;Achates&quot; was relieved by &quot;Woolston&quot; as parent ship of the 1st Anti-Submarine Flotilla, and relieved as emergency destroyer at Devonport. By May 1939, &quot;Achates&quot; was attached to the 6th Submarine Flotilla, based at Portland.

===Second World War===
At the start of the Second World War in September 1939, &quot;Achates&quot; joined the 18th Destroyer Flotilla of Portsmouth Command, carrying out anti-submarine patrols and convoy escort duties in the English Channel. In July 1940, &quot;Achates&quot; joined the 16th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Harwich, operating on patrol and escort duties in the North Sea. On 2 August 1940, the Home Fleet reorganised its destroyer flotillas, with &quot;Achates&quot; joining the 12th Destroyer Flotilla. In November 1940, &quot;Achates&quot; joined the 4th Escort Group. On 2 November 1940, the German submarine attempted an attack on the destroyer , part of the escort for Convoy OB 237, but &quot;Antelope&quot; detected the submarine and attacked with depth charges, while sending out an alert which brought up &quot;Achates&quot;. &quot;Achates&quot;″s sonar was out of service, however, but continued depth charge attacks from &quot;Antelope&quot; badly damaged &quot;U-31&quot;, which surfaced and scuttled herself. &quot;Achates&quot; was still a member of the 4th Escort Group on 30 December 1940. She joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet, during 1941.

====Battle of the Denmark Strait====

On 22 May, just after midnight, &quot;Achates&quot; sailed along with the destroyers , &quot;Antelope&quot;, , , and , escorting the battlecruiser and the battleship to cover the northern approaches against a breakout into the Atlantic by the German battleship and the cruiser . The intention was that the force would watch the Denmark Strait, providing support for the cruisers and .

On the evening of 23 May, weather started getting bad, with the destroyers struggling to keep pace with &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. At 0203 on the morning of 24 May, the destroyers were ordered to continue to search to the North while the two capital ships turned to the south. At about 0535, the German forces were sighted by &quot;Hood&quot;, and shortly after, the Germans sighted the British ships. Firing commenced at 0552. At about 0600, &quot;Hood&quot; suffered a massive explosion, sinking the ship within three or four minutes.

Following the loss of &quot;Hood&quot;, Admiral Wake-Walker, aboard &quot;Norfolk&quot;, ordered the destroyers to search for survivors, with the two cruisers continuing to shadow the German ships. The first destroyer, &quot;Electra&quot; arrived about two hours after &quot;Hood&quot; went under. They were expecting to find many survivors, and rigged scrambling nets and heaving lines, and placed life belts on the deck where they could be quickly thrown in, but only three survivors were found. &quot;Electra&quot; rescued these survivors, and continued searching. No more were found, only driftwood, debris, and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area.

====Kirkenes to Torch====
On 23 July 1941, while the task force to take part in a carrier raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo was assembling off Iceland, &quot;Achates&quot; struck a British mine and was severely damaged, blowing off the destroyer&#x27;s bow, including &quot;A&quot; gun, and killing 63 of her crew and injuring 25 more. &quot;Achates&quot; was towed to Seyðisfjörður by &quot;Anthony&quot; and after temporary repairs, left Iceland under the tow of the tug &quot;Assurance&quot; on 7 August, but a storm on 10 August caused further damage, with longitudinal members fracturing and cracking of upper deck plating, and the ships had to put into Skaglefjord in the Faroe Islands, where further temporary repairs were made. &quot;Achates&quot; eventually reached the Tyne on 24 August 1941.

&quot;Achates&quot; remained under repair for eight months before recommissioning. On 23 May 1942, &quot;Achates&quot; joined Arctic convoy PQ 16, remaining with the convoy until 30 May, when the convoy had reached Russian waters with the loss of seven out of 36 merchant ships. &quot;Achates&quot; returned to British waters as part of the westbound convoy QP 13, which left Arkhangelsk on 26 June. &quot;Achates&quot; remained with the convoy until 7 July 1942. In September 1942, &quot;Achates&quot; formed part of the Ocean Escort for Arctic Convoy PQ 18, joining on 7 September and remaining with it until the convoy reached Arkhangelsk on 21 September. In total, 13 merchant ships were sunk by German submarines and air attacks, with the convoy&#x27;s escort sinking three submarines.

In November 1942, &quot;Achates&quot; took part in Operation Torch, the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa. She formed part of an assault convoy, and was then detached to escort aircraft carriers during the landings at Oran, Algeria. On 8 November 1942, while deployed off Oran, &quot;Achates&quot; detected, and attacked a Vichy French submarine, which had sortied to contest the Allied landings in the area. &quot;Achates&quot;″ attack saw the rise of oil to the surface of the sea and huge air bubbles, as well as debris from both inside, and outside the submarine. Two submarines were sunk by &quot;Achates&quot; and the destroyer off Oran that day, and .

====Battle of the Barents Sea====
On 25 December 1942, &quot;Achates&quot; joined the escort of Convoy JW 51B en route from Loch Ewe to Murmansk. On 31 December 1942, the convoy was attacked by the German heavy cruisers and &quot;Lützow&quot; together with six large destroyers in the Battle of the Barents Sea. The German plan was to divide the attacking force, with &quot;Hipper&quot; and three destroyers attacking the convoy from the northwest, drawing the escort off, so that &quot;Lützow&quot; could attack the convoy unhindered from the south.

When the German attack began at about 9:15 hr, &quot;Achates&quot;, following standing orders, positioned herself to lay smoke screens to obscure the convoy from attacking forces while the more modern destroyers of the escort would intercept the enemy force. &quot;Achates&quot; was damaged by a near-miss from &quot;Hipper&quot; early in the action, with shell splinters causing flooding, but the destroyer continued to lay smoke. At 11:15 hr &quot;Achates&quot; was ordered to join the badly damaged , but as she pulled clear of her own smoke screen, was spotted by &quot;Hipper&quot; and badly hit, killing 40 men, including &quot;Achates&quot;″ commanding officer, Lieutenant-Commander A. H. T. Johns, and causing increased flooding. Command was assumed by the destroyer&#x27;s second in command, Lieutenant Loftus Peyon-Jones. Despite the damage, &quot;Achates&quot; continued to lay smoke to protect the convoy, while flooding and the resultant list gradually increased. At about 13:00 hr, power was lost, and &quot;Achates&quot; signalled the trawler to come to her assistance. However, at 13:30 hr, as &quot;Northern Gem&quot; approached, &quot;Achates&quot; suddenly capsized. &quot;Northern Gem&quot; rescued 81 of &quot;Achates&quot;″ crew, one of whom later died on the trawler. A total of 113 of &quot;Achates&quot;″ crew were killed.

Despite being heavily outgunned the escort, under the command of Captain R. St. Vincent Sherbrooke, VC, held off the attacks until the covering cruisers and came to the escort&#x27;s aid. &quot;Sheffield&quot; damaged &quot;Hipper&quot; and sank the German destroyer , causing the Germans to break off the attack. No merchant ships were sunk. Peyton-Jones was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his role in the battle, with other awards to &quot;Achates&quot; crew including a Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, a Distinguished Service Cross and seven Distinguished Service Medals. Sixteen men were Mentioned in dispatches, eleven, including Johns, posthumously.

<doc id="647318" wikidata="Q6418399" url="?curid=647318" title="Kittanning Gap">
<text>Kittanning Gap, one of the gaps of the Allegheny, is a now a relatively unimportant wooded ravine (water gap) along the ascent (at the foot) of the Allegheny Ridge &quot;(also called the &#x27;Allegheny Front&#x27; or &#x27;Allegheny escarpment&#x27;)&quot; in central Pennsylvania in the United States. The gap was one of several optional paths of the Kittanning Path Amerindian trail turned into an emigrant route over the Alleghenies in the day of animal powered technology. The option up the gap was likely &quot;the &#x27;better choice&#x27; of an ascending route&quot; for ox cart and wagon (such as those made downstream in Conestoga, Pennsylvania) encumbered white settlers pouring west across the Alleghenies escarpment.
The 1780s–1830s saw an increasing flood of emigrants into the Ohio Country and territories beyond after (and well before) the end of the American Revolution. It is located in Logan Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania just west of Altoona, PA, overlooking the former Pennsylvania Railroad trackage beginning to climb up alongside Glen White Run to the hard hairpin turn that begins at the confluence with the Kittanning Run before its famous traverse bends around in the famous Horseshoe Curve approximately 5 mi (8 km) west of Altoona. 
The USGS does not use the Kittanning Run stream for an eponymous gap name since it follows local naming conventions and traditions. The Kittanning Gap is formed from the erosion valley of a seasonal freshet, so is lightly eroded compared to other gaps of the Allegheny which have larger flow volumes resulting in narrower, deeper valleys with steeper, harder to traverse walls.

However, topographical analysis shows the climb up from the Altoona Plateau up to the Allegheny Plateau through Kittanning Gap would bend first northerly then curve gradually climbing along several diverse hill sides as to path hooked back to resume a westward heading in the valley of Clearfield Creek coming out in the vicinity of Ashville, Pennsylvania but about a half-mile distant and on the opposite side of the summit that sources the Kittanning Run. In short, climbing more quickly and directly up the escarpment via either the valleys of &quot;Kittanning Run&quot; or &quot;Glen White Run&quot; was likely the route of choice (when footing was good) for foot traffic and mule trains, whilst the longer more round about but easier climb up the &quot;Kittanning Gap&quot; gave animal drawn wagon and carts the better easier path. Any one of these variations were collectively parts of the Kittanning Path as it became known.

==History==
In the 18th century the Kittanning Path passed through the gap, providing a route between central and western Pennsylvania for Native Americans and early white settlers. Why the gap is left of the Kittanning Run can only be speculated upon, but a topographical examination suggests for 16th-19th century peoples &quot;on foot or pulling a cart or Conestoga wagon&quot;, turning right up the gap would lead them across gentler climbing terrains, so may have been the path of choice.

The Kittanning Path lower valley was later selected as the climbing approach for the 1845 railroad line chartered (ordered, in effect) to cross the Allegheny Mountains. The challenge of constructing a railroad through the ridge led to the construction of the unique Horseshoe Curve in 1854, once trumpeted as the world&#x27;s busiest railway, and now designated as a National Historic Landmark.

<text>Camp Bucca () was a forward operating base that housed a theater internment facility maintained by the United States military in the vicinity of Umm Qasr, Iraq. After being taken over by the U.S. military (800th Military Police Brigade) in April 2003, it was renamed after Ronald Bucca, the only New York City fire marshal in history to be killed in the line of duty, during the 11 September 2001 attacks. The site where Camp Bucca was built had earlier housed the tallest structure in Iraq, a 492-meter-high TV mast.

After the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, many detainees from Abu Ghraib were transferred to Bucca, where U.S. authorities hoped to showcase a model detention facility. Nevertheless, Camp Bucca was the scene of prisoner abuse documented over many years by the Red Cross, Amnesty International, and U.S. Army investigators. It housed numerous prominent Islamic extremists, including a significant portion of the leadership of Al Qaeda in Iraq, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, future leader of the Islamic State (IS), who enjoyed good relations with camp authorities while there. Bucca has been described as a breeding ground for Islamic extremism, and has been cited as contributing to the emergence of IS.

On 17 September 2009, the U.S. military announced that the base would be closed. In December 2010, the U.S. military handed the base to the government of Iraq, who, on the same day, gave Kufan Group of Iraq a license to invest in the new Basra Gateway, to provide a hub for Iraq&#x27;s port.

==Significant events==

===2003===
On 18 May 2003, U.S. military forces mistakenly released Mohammed Jawad An-Neifus from the Camp Bucca. An-Neifus is suspected of being involved in the mass murder of thousands of Iraqi Shias whose remains were later found at a mass gravesite in the southern city of al-Mahawil.

===2004===
On 26 January 2004 three detainees escaped at night during a period of intense fog. An investigation &quot;concluded that the detainees crawled under a fence when visibility was only 10–15 meters due to fog&quot;.

On 19 October 2004, a 26-year-old security internee died of unknown causes.

===2005===
On 5 January 2005, a 31-year-old security internee died of what appears to be natural causes.

In April 2005, in Compound 4, a riot broke out in which detainees threw rocks and fashioned weapons out of tent poles. Detainees held a military soldier hostage until the riot was dispelled by the use of lethal force. Four detainees were killed and six were injured. As is standard procedure in all cases of prison riots and the use of lethal force, the matter was investigated by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Criminal Investigations Division. The investigation concluded that a detainee leader had incited the riot by making an accusation that camp soldiers were stepping on Korans during a search for contraband. No soldiers were found guilty of any wrongdoing during the incident.

On 5 February 2005, the tabloid paper &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that units at Camp Bucca organized and held a mud wrestling party on 30 October 2004. The party was organized by members of the 160th MP Battalion.
On 25 March 2005, a complete escape tunnel was discovered, though no prisoners had yet managed to escape.

On 1 April 2005, two Iraqis and four U.S. prison guards were wounded in a riot at Camp Bucca.

On 15 April 2005, a dispute broke out between two groups of detainees at one of the compounds of the Camp Bucca theater internment facility at approximately 11 pm. The fight left one detainee dead, was confined between the detainees in one compound, and was not directed at U.S. forces.

On 16 April 2005, 11 detainees escaped Camp Bucca by cutting through in the facility&#x27;s exterior fence and crawling through the unfilled portion of a previously discovered escape tunnel.

On 19 April 2005, a 51-year-old male security detainee at Camp Bucca died of natural causes.

On 14 May 2005, a 30-year-old male detainee at Camp Bucca died from a heart attack.

On 27 July 2005, a 30-year-old male security detainee at Camp Bucca died as a result of renal failure and other organ failure due to chronic malaria.

On 28 September 2005, Sergeant Steve Morin Jr. assigned to the 111th Engineer Battalion and Air Force Airman 1st Class Elizabeth N. Jacobson assigned to the 17th Security Forces Squadron stationed at Camp Bucca were killed in action when an improvised explosive device detonated near their convoy vehicle near the Iraqi town of Safwan.

In October 2005, the International Committee of the Red Cross began the Family Visitation Allowance Program at Camp Bucca. The program provides monetary assistance to families of detainees held at Camp Bucca to help cover part of the traveling and hotel costs required to visit the facility. The benefits are calculated based on the distance between their home and the city of Umm Qasr. In December 2006 a similar program was initiated at Camp Shaibe, the British internment facility in Shaibah, near Al Basrah.

On 5 October 2005, a 43-year-old male security detainee died of a heart attack.

On 13 October 2005, eligible detainees at Camp Bucca, Abu Ghraib prison and Camp Cropper were allowed to vote in the Iraqi Constitutional Referendum. The rest of the country voted on 15 October 2005.

On 23 October 2005, a 73-year-old male security detainee died of natural causes at Camp Bucca.

On 25 October 2005, it was reported that Specialist Christopher T. Monroe assigned to the Military Police Battalion stationed at Camp Bucca was killed in a road accident when providing security for a convoy in the vicinity of Al Basrah. The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Erinys International by Monroe&#x27;s father.

On 5 November 2005, a 65-year-old male security detainee died of natural causes at Camp Bucca.

On 12 December 2005, nearly 90 percent of all eligible security detainees in Multi-National Forces-Iraq Theater Internment Facilities participated in the democratic vote on the Iraqi National Ballot.

===2006===
On 7 January 2006, Sergeant Nathan Field and Specialist Robert Johnson assigned to the 414th Military Police Company were killed in a non-combat vehicle accident just outside Camp Bucca.

On 7 March 2006, a 36-year-old detainee died of natural causes.

11 May 2006, detainees initiated a multiple compound riot that included the burning of their living quarters, burning a Humvee and assaults on other detainees. The reported cause of the riot was detainees being unhappy that their housing areas were searched and that a Qu&#x27;ran with Takferi writing had been placed in a clear evidence bag that the detainees presumed was a trash bag. The riot started around 7 am in compound 10. The initial incident was stopped within an hour but around 11 am the theater internment facility exploded with multiple compound riots. Multiple weapons were found during the initial search, and based on the detainees use of weapons against the guard force, multiple weapons were confiscated during additional searches initiated because of the riot.

On 2 June 2006, the Army opened an Iraqi-based detention center training facility at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri called Camp Charlie. This new facility is modeled after the theater internment facility at Camp Bucca. A similar facility was opened at Fort Leavenworth in August 2006.

On 1 July 2006, Airman 1st Class Carl Jerome Ware Jr. of the 886th Expeditionary Security Force Squadron assigned to Camp Bucca died of non-combat related injuries. Initial reports stated that the airmen was killed by an accidental discharge of a gun being cleaned by another airman; however in February 2007, it was reported that Airman 1st Class Kyle J. Dalton, of the 15th Security Forces Squadron, Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, had been charged on 30 November 2006 with one count of murder and failure to obey a lawful order in relation to the shooting. Dalton also faced a charge of assault for a separate incident that occurred on 30 June 2006 involving Ware and another airman. Dalton, who was deployed in the Middle East at the time the charges were brought, had an Article 32 hearing and was Court-martialed on 23 April 2007 at Langley Air Force Base. As part of a plea bargain deal, Dalton pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and violating a lawful general regulation by drawing or aiming a firearm when deadly force was unnecessary. Dalton was sentenced to 10 years in prison, given a dishonorable discharge, reduced in rank from Senior Airman to Airman Basic and ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances. Dalton admitted to the court that he tracked Ware with his pistol in the barracks and pulled the trigger thinking the weapon was unloaded. He also admitted that he had previously aimed a loaded M4 carbine at another airman.

In July 2006, it was announced that the Army&#x27;s inspector general had requested an investigation to determine if an Anti-Deficiency Act violation occurred during the building of the detention facility. The Anti-Deficiency Act provides that no one can obligate the Government to make payments for which money has not already been authorized. The inspector general&#x27;s report was released to Congress on 30 January 2007 and in it concluded: &quot;Army personnel associated with funding of Phases I and II construction of the Internment Facility at Camp Bucca, Iraq, did not implement sufficient controls to ensure military compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there were two ADA violations with the FY 2004 Army Operation and Maintenance Appropriation. United States Department of Defense Office of General Counsel is completing its review and expects to sign out the report to the Department of Defense Comptroller in the second quarter of FY 2007.&quot;

On 12 October 2006, an Iraqi detainee died from a heart attack. The detainee had been hospitalized since 5 October after complaining of chest pains. An autopsy was performed to determine the cause of death.

On 25 November 2006, American forces announced that a detainee died of natural causes. The detainee had been hospitalized since 23 November after complaining of chest pains.

On 24 December 2006, two detainees attempted an escape from one of the U.S. Navy staffed compounds during the dense seasonal fog. One of the detainees was allegedly an improvised explosive device (IED) maker.

===2007===
On 17 January 2007, U.S. Navy Petty Officer Second Class Joseph D. Alomar, a member of Navy Provisional Detainee Battalion 2, assigned to Camp Bucca died of non-combat related injuries. The sailor is reported to have died from a gunshot wound to the head.

On 11 February 2007 Specialist Dennis L. Sellen Jr. of the 1st Battalion, 185th Infantry Regiment was accidentally shot and killed by a fellow soldier who was cleaning his weapon after a mission. The incident is currently being investigated.

On 2 March 2007 Specialist Christopher D. Young, 20, of Los Angeles, California, died in Safwan, Iraq, of wounds sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. He was assigned to Company C, 3rd Battalion, 160th Infantry Regiment, California Army National Guard, San Pedro, California.

On 15 March 2007 U.S. military officials announced plans to once again expand Camp Bucca and Camp Cropper. Officials stated that this increase in capacity would be necessary to handle the detainees generated from the increased security operations in Baghdad. At the time of the report, Camp Bucca&#x27;s detainee population stood at 13,800.

On 26 April 2007, an Iraqi detainee died from what MNF-I reports as injuries sustained during an apparent assault by other detainees. He is reported to have been the sixth detainee to have died in MNF-I TIFs as a result of detainee on detainee violence in the past year.

On 9 June 2007, 6 detainees were killed, 68 wounded and one Iraqi corrections officer was wounded when a rocket struck Compound 8, in the Theater Internment Facility located at Camp Bucca. On 10 June 2007, a seventh detainee, who had been medically evacuated to Balad Air Base, died from wounds he sustained in the attack. On 23 June 2007 an eighth detainee who had been hospitalized in critical condition since the attack, died from cardiac arrest.

On 21 June 2007 a security detainee died of cardiac arrest during a routine medical transfer from Camp Cropper to Camp Bucca.

On 25 June 2007 a soldier assigned to the 178th Infantry was injured when the vehicle he was driving drove over a buried explosive.

On 1 July 2007, a detainee died from what is being reported as natural causes while in the intensive care unit at the Theater Internment Facility hospital at Camp Bucca.

On 12 July 2007, a detainee died from what is being reported as injuries suffered in an assault by other detainees. This is the second detainee in coalition forces custody to die from detainee on detainee violence within a week. On the same day, the Associated Press reported that Camp Bucca was among several sites in Iraq that had sensitive information posted on non-secure web sites. The Camp Bucca documents, posted on the web site of CH2M Hill Companies of Meridian, Colorado, revealed locations of where prisoners are held, locations of fuel tanks, and the locations of security fences, guard towers and other security measures. The company has subsequently added password protection to its site.

In August 2007, two separate news articles reported Camp Bucca&#x27;s detainee populate stood at approximately 20,000 inmates.

In October 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced it had suspended its visits to Camp Bucca due to the deteriorating security situation in the area. The ICRC visits all detention facilities in Iraq to monitor the conditions detainees are receiving and make recommendations where they perceive improvements could be made. To maintain their neutral status, they refuse coalition security when traveling in Iraq, which causes them to occasionally suspend visits when they deem conditions too hazardous for their personnel.

On 31 October 2007, it was announced that Camp Bucca would be expanded once again to increase its capacity from 20,000 to 30,000 detainees. The $110 million project will be overseen by The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and would include $17.6 million retrofit of &quot;13 existing compounds to add concrete pads to prevent tunneling, better segregation areas, and better shower and latrine facilities&quot; as well as new housing, a waste water treatment plant, a water treatment plant and a $3.2 million brick factory for prisoner labor.

===2008===
On January 8, 2008, a QRF squad came under attack and hit by an explosively formed penetrator resulting in 3 coalition WIA and 1 Iraqi WIA. The squad was responding to Umm Qasr to check on a British unit that been attacked by rockets. 

On 24 February 2008, Camp Bucca was attacked with rocket fire that killed one Army and Air Force Exchange Service employee and wounded several other civilian contractors. The rocket attack came less than a week after a convoy from Camp Bucca was attacked by an improvised explosive device. No one was seriously injured in that attack.

In August 2008, it was announced that 6 sailors had been charged and would face courts-martial for abusing detainees at Camp Bucca. The abuse allegedly occurred on 14 May and involved beatings of two detainees and the sealing of eight detainees in a cell filled with pepper spray while the cells&#x27; ventilation was secured. The abuse apparently occurred after some detainees attacked guards, spitting on them and throwing containers filled with human waste at them. Seven other sailors received non-judicial punishment for failing to report the incidents. Two had their charges dismissed, and the remainder were reduced in rank or faced suspended punishment. In November 2008, the 6 sailors faced an article 32 hearing at Naval Air Station Jacksonville on charges of conspiracy, cruelty and maltreatment and making false official statements. Damage Controlman 2nd Class Adam M. White, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and assault and was sentenced to 89 days confinement and reduction of two pay grades. Adams claims he and other sailors participated in the beating of two detainees at the direction of Chief Aviation Structural Mechanic Tracy Necaise because the prisoners spit and threw feces at guards. Necaise&#x27;s attorney blamed upper-level Navy officers for the incident because they assigned the sailors to Camp Bucca without any prior experience working in law enforcement or detention facilities. Necaise and the remaining sailors pleaded not guilty and could face trial in 2009.

===2009===

On 17 September 2009 Camp Bucca closed down detainee operations.

== Prisoner abuse scandals ==
Camp Bucca was the scene of egregious abuse of prisoners by military personnel from its establishment in 2003 until its closure in 2009. It was the largest internment camp in American history.

In 2003, prisoners freed from Camp Bucca described &quot;detainees punished by hours lying bound in the sun; being attacked by dogs; being deprived of sufficient water; spending days with hoods over their heads.&quot; After leaked pictures of abuse from another U.S. prison in Iraq, Abu Ghraib, stirred outrage and attention to that prison, one former Camp Bucca prisoner said, &quot;I wish somebody could go take a picture of Camp Bucca.&quot;

A 2003 report by Amnesty International found that prisoners at Camp Bucca &quot;were held in tents in the extreme heat and were not provided with sufficient drinking water or adequate washing facilities,&quot; and that &quot;they were forced to use open trenches for toilets and were not given a change of clothes -- even after two months detention.&quot;

A 2004 report by United States Army investigators found &quot;egregious acts and grave breaches of international law&quot; at Camp Bucca.

A 2004 report by the International Committee of the Red Cross described Geneva Convention violations at Camp Bucca and stated that &quot;inmates were routinely treated by their guards with general contempt, with petty violence such as having orders screamed at them and being cursed, kicked, struck with rifle butts, roughed up or pushed around. They were reportedly handcuffed in the back and hooded for the duration of the interrogation and were prohibited from talking to each other or to the guards.&quot; A Red Cross representative said that their report documented a &quot;broad pattern&quot; of abuse, as opposed to isolated incidents.

A 2006 report by Amnesty International contained alleged violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention by U.S. military personnel at Camp Bucca. These allegations include that &quot;internees at Camp Bucca are alleged to have been exposed deliberately to extremes of both heat and cold, by being made to wait for hours in the heat of the sun while their accommodation was searched and forcibly showered with cold water and exposed to cold air conditioners.&quot;

In 2007, a Canadian citizen and U.S. resident who had been a prisoner at Camp Bucca described abuse by military personnel. The prisoner, Hossam Shaltout, called Camp Bucca a &quot;torture camp&quot; and said that prisoners were beaten and sexually humiliated. Shaltout said that his arms and legs had been hogtied by US soldiers who then placed scorpions on his body.

In 2008, six United States Navy personnel were charged and later convicted of abusing Camp Bucca prisoners after they beat the prisoners and locked several overnight in a room that had been filled with pepper spray.

==Role in the growth of ISIS==

Camp Bucca has been described as playing an important role in shaping the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The detention of large numbers of Ba&#x27;athists and Islamists during the Iraqi insurgency provided them with the opportunity to forge alliances and learn from each other, combining the ideological fervour of the latter with the organizational skills of the former. Former Camp Bucca detainees who went on to become leaders in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant include Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of the ISIL before his death in October 2019; Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi who succeeded him; Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, spokesperson and senior ISIL leader; Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, al-Baghdadi&#x27;s deputy; Haji Bakr, who spearheaded ISIL&#x27;s expansion into Syria; Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi, the military leader responsible for planning the seizure of Mosul; and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another senior military leader. Ahmed al-Sharaa, who founded the Syrian Al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, was also a Camp Bucca detainee.

<doc id="647324" wikidata="Q4218461" url="?curid=647324" title="Accredited investor">
<text>An accredited or sophisticated investor is an investor with a special status under financial regulation laws. The definition of an accredited investor (if any), and the consequences of being classified as such, vary between countries. Generally, accredited investors include high-net-worth individuals, banks, financial institutions, and other large corporations, who have access to complex and higher-risk investments such as venture capital, hedge funds, and angel investments.
Laws may require that some types of financial offerings may only be made to accredited investors.
==Criteria for accreditation==
===Australia===
s 708(8) of the Corporations Act 2001 is found in Chapter 6D (Fundraising). It defines &quot;sophisticated investor&quot; so as to exclude them from certain disclosure requirements.
That section provides for an accountant to issue a certificate stating that an individual meets the criteria prescribed in the &quot;Corporations Regulations 2001&quot;, namely net assets of at least $2.5 million, or a gross income for each of the last two financial years of at least $250,000.
There is a second definition of &quot;sophisticated investor&quot; in s 761GA of the Corporations Act 2001 in Chapter 7 (Financial services and markets). It defines sophisticated investors so that they can be treated as wholesale (rather than retail) clients.
According to ASIC, a person with a sophisticated investor certificate is a sophisticated investor for the purpose of Chapter 6D, and a wholesale client for the purpose of Chapter 7.
===Brazil===
On December 17, 2014, CVM issued the Instructions No. 554 and No. 555, which became effective from July 1, 2015 according to Mondaq.
The definition of accredited investors under the United States SEC’s Regulation D are analogous in Brazil to the combination of two categories of investors, classified by the &quot;Comissão de Valores Mobiliários&quot; (CVM) as &quot;&quot;investidor profissional&quot; (professional investor) and &quot;investidor qualificado&quot;&quot; (qualified investor) under Instruction 539, articles 9-A and 9-B.
===Canada===
An &quot;Accredited Investor&quot; (as defined in NI 45 106) is:
# a person registered under the securities legislation of a jurisdiction of Canada, as an adviser or dealer, other than a person registered solely as a limited market dealer under one or both of the Securities Act (Ontario) or the Securities Act (Newfoundland and Labrador); or
# an individual registered or formerly registered under the securities legislation of a jurisdiction of Canada as a representative of a person referred to in paragraph (a); or
# an individual who, either alone or with a spouse, beneficially owns financial assets having an aggregate realizable value that before taxes, but net of any related liabilities, exceeds $1,000,000; or
# an individual whose net income before taxes exceeded $200,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years or whose net income before taxes combined with that of a spouse exceeded $300,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years and who, in either case, reasonably expects to exceed that net income level in the current calendar year; or
# an individual who, either alone or with a spouse, has net assets of at least $5,000,000; or
# a person, other than an individual or investment fund, that has net assets of at least $5,000,000 as shown on its most recently prepared financial statements; or
# a trust company or trust corporation registered or authorized to carry on business under the Trust and Loan Companies Act (Canada) or under comparable legislation in a jurisdiction of Canada or a foreign jurisdiction, acting on behalf of a fully managed account managed by the trust company or trust corporation, as the case may be; or
# an investment fund that distributes or has distributed its securities only to (i) a person that is or was an accredited investor at the time of the distribution, (ii) a person that acquires or acquired securities in the circumstances referred to in sections 2.10 of NI 45 106 [Minimum amount investment] or 2.19 of NI 45 106 [Additional investment in investment funds], or (iii) a person described in paragraph (i) or (ii) that acquires or acquired securities under section 2.18 of NI 45 106 [Investment fund reinvestment];
# a person acting on behalf of a fully managed account managed by that person, if that person is registered or authorized to carry on business as an adviser or the equivalent under the securities legislation of a jurisdiction of Canada or a foreign jurisdiction; or
# a person in respect of which all of the owners of interests, direct, indirect or beneficial, except the voting securities required by law to be owned by directors, are persons that are accredited investors (as defined in NI 45 106); or
# an investment fund that is advised by a person registered as an adviser or a person that is exempt from registration as an adviser.
Note that as of 2016, many provinces in Canada now allow non-accredited investors to invest in private markets – under specified limits.
===European Union===
Retail clients requesting treatment as &#x27;elective&#x27; professional clients (as defined by Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)) must satisfy at least two of the following &quot;quantitative&quot; criteria in assessing the client&#x27;s expertise, experience and knowledge:
* the client has carried out trade transactions, in significant size (at least €50,000), on the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous four quarters;
* the size of the client&#x27;s financial instrument portfolio, defined as including cash deposits and financial instruments, exceeds €500,000;

# A corporation which is wholly owned by accredited investors based on the criteria above.

===New Zealand===

===United States===
In the United States, to be considered an accredited investor, a natural person must have a net worth of at least $1,000,000, excluding the value of one&#x27;s primary residence, or have income at least $200,000 each year for the last two years (or $300,000 combined income if married) and have the expectation to make the same amount this year, or must otherwise be a holder of a specific license in good standing. Unlike most ordinary investors, accredited investors are permitted to invest in funds exempt from registering with the SEC under Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (so-called &quot;3(c)(1) funds&quot;), though not necessarily those exempt under section 3(c)(7).

There is a more restricted US legal criteria of &quot;qualified purchaser&quot;, which generally refers to a person or institution with $5,000,000 of investable assets. Qualified purchasers may invest in 3(c)(7) funds in addition to 3(c)(1) funds.
More precisely, the term &quot;accredited investor&quot; is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as:
# a bank, insurance company, registered investment company, business development company, or small business investment company;
# an employee benefit plan, within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, if a bank, insurance company, or registered investment adviser makes the investment decisions, or if the plan has total assets in excess of $5 million;
# a charitable organization, corporation, or partnership with assets exceeding $5 million;
# a director, executive officer, or general partner of the company selling the securities;
# a business in which all the equity owners are accredited investors;
# a natural person who has individual net worth, or joint net worth with the person&#x27;s spouse, that exceeds $1 million at the time of the purchase, or has assets under management of $1 million or above, excluding the value of the individual&#x27;s primary residence;
# a natural person with income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year
# a trust with assets in excess of $5 million, not formed to acquire the securities offered, whose purchases a sophisticated person makes.
# a natural person who has certain professional certifications, designations or credentials or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution, which the Commission may designate from time to time. Presently holders in good standing of the Series 7, Series 65, and Series 82 licenses.
# natural persons who are &quot;knowledgeable employees&quot; of a fund with respect to private investments.
# limited liability companies with $5 million in assets may be accredited investors.
# SEC and state-registered investment advisers, exempt reporting advisers, and rural business investment companies (RBICs) may qualify.
# Indian tribes, governmental bodies, funds, and entities organized under the laws of foreign countries, that own &quot;investments&quot;, as defined in Rule 2a51-1(b) under the Investment Company Act, in excess of $5 million and that was not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the securities offered.

<text>The Blues (; known as the Auckland Blues from 1996 to 1999) are a New Zealand professional rugby union team based in Auckland, who play in the Super Rugby competition. Like New Zealand&#x27;s four other Super Rugby teams, the Blues were established by the NZRU in 1996. One of the most successful teams in Super Rugby history, the Blues won the competition in its first two seasons, 1996 and 1997, and again in 2003 and 2024. Additionally, the team were finalists in 1998 and 2022, and semi-finalists in 2007, 2011 and 2023. They won a Trans Tasman competition in 2021.

==History==

===Formation, early years and immediate success (1996–97)===

Along with New Zealand&#x27;s other Super Rugby sides, the Blues were established by the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) to take part in the newly formed Super 12 competition which, involved teams from South Africa and Australia in addition to New Zealand. Each of New Zealand&#x27;s five sides represented a number of provincial unions, with the Blues representing the Auckland, Counties Manukau and Thames Valley unions, while the neighbouring Waikato Chiefs representing the Waikato, Bay of Plenty, King Country, Northland and North Harbour unions. As the amount of international representatives in the Auckland region was thought to be unfair, it was split up between The Blues and The Chiefs. During this era, the Blues played the majority of their home matches at Eden Park, with round robin fixtures occasionally held at Growers Stadium in Pukekohe.

The Blues tasted immediate success, winning the Super 12 back-to-back in 1996 and 1997. In 1996 the side won eight of eleven round robin matches and finished the regular season in second place (behind the Queensland Reds on 41 points. They then went on to defeat Northern Transvaaal, now the Bulls, 48–11 in the semi-final at Eden Park. This result secured a home final, where the Blues comfortably defeated the 45–21. In 1997, the side improved on their previous season, comfortably topping the table with 50 points after going undefeated in the regular season, the sole blemish on an otherwise perfect season being a draw with Northern Transvaal in a re-match of the previous season&#x27;s semi-final. The Blues once again easily won their semi-final, defeating the Sharks 55–36 at Eden Park and again securing a home final. The 1997 final was a more hard-fought encounter than the previous year&#x27;s, with the Blues defeating the ACT Brumbies 23–7.

===Middle years (1998–2005)===
By the end of the 1990s the number of international representatives from the Blues region had decreased. This led the Blues and the Chiefs to arrange a swap, where the Chiefs would represent the Thames Valley and Counties Manukau provincial unions in exchange for the Blues representing the Northland and North Harbour unions in addition to Auckland. Although in the seasons leading up to the trade North Harbour and Northland had outperformed Counties Manukau and Thames Valley in provincial rugby (thus potentially widening the already sizeable gap between the Blues&#x27; and Chiefs&#x27; on-field performance), it enabled both teams to represent unions in closer geographical proximity. Because of this trade, the Blues lost the area colloquially referred to as &quot;South Auckland&quot;, (excluding those portions of the South Auckland to the north of Manurewa). Thus, the Blues traded a portion of South Auckland for the Northern portion of the Auckland region and Northland, and still do not represent the entire Auckland region. Generally supporters in the South Auckland region identify as Blues supporters even though they are technically in the Chiefs region. In 2000, the Auckland Blues dropped the Auckland prefix from their name, and became known simply as &quot;Blues&quot;.

The 1998 season saw the Blues again top the points table with 43 points at the conclusion of the round robin, with nine wins and two losses to their credit. They defeated the Otago Highlanders by 37–31 in the side&#x27;s third consecutive home semi-final, securing a home final against the Crusaders, a match which promised a great deal due to Auckland&#x27;s traditional sporting rivalry with Canterbury. The Crusaders ultimately won the match by 20–13, putting an end to the Blues&#x27; dominance of the competition. 

From 1999 – 2002 the Blues&#x27; onfield performance was poor, missing the playoffs every season, finishing at an all-time low of 11th on the ladder in 2001 with just four wins for the season. The club was able to turn its from around in the 2003 season, topping the ladder with 49 points and 10 wins from 11 matches. The team went on to defeat the ACT Brumbies by 42–21 in the semi-final, before beating the Crusaders 21–17 in the final for the team&#x27;s third Super Rugby title. The Blues were unable to follow their 2003 success up in 2004 and 2005 however, missing the playoffs in both seasons. 

===Super 14 era (2006–10)===

The expanded 14 team competition could not have started worse for the Blues, who were in 2006 forced by the NZRU to include North Harbour captain Rua Tipoki in their squad of 24 players who are &#x27;protected&#x27; from the draft. Tipoki was originally to be excluded from the draft due to personal circumstances to stay in Auckland. Andrew Mehrtens had in the past done this with the Crusaders. The NZRU however forced coach David Nucifora to pick Tipoki in his 24-man squad and hence drop another player. It is believed the NZRU was in favour of dropping players such as Isa Nacewa who are ineligible to play for the All Blacks. Instead, Nucifora excluded All Black Isaia Toeava, who subsequently played for the Hurricanes in 2006. Following the draft fiasco, and the forgettable season which followed, the Blues showed signs of resurgence in 2007, finishing the round robin in fourth place, securing a semi-final against the Sharks in Durban. The travel and form of the opposition were too difficult to overcome, however, with the Blues losing 34–18 to the eventual runners-up. The 2008 season, the final under coach David Nucifora, saw the team finish the season with an 8–5 record and a sixth-place finish on the ladder. In 2009, Pat Lam was appointed as coach, however the team was not able to make significant improvements under his leadership for the remainder of Super 14, missing the playoffs in both the 2009 and 2010 seasons.

===Super Rugby era (2011–present)===

====2011 season====

In 2011 the Super Rugby competition was expanded to 15 teams and adopted a conference format. The Blues had a successful start to the season, defeating the Crusaders by 24–22 at Eden Park. This was followed by a win and a loss on their South African tour, followed by a 22–22 draw against the Western Force in Perth. This was followed by a seven match winning streak between rounds five and twelve. However, the mid-season winning streak came to an abrupt end with a 37–31 loss to the Queensland Reds in Brisbane, which initiated a four-match losing streak. In the final round-robin match of the season, the Blues defeated the Highlanders by 33–16 at Eden Park, securing the side&#x27;s first playoff appearance since 2007 and first home playoff match since 2003. The team subsequently defeated the New South Wales Waratahs 26 – 13 to secure a semi-final against the Queensland Reds in Brisbane, which they lost 30–13.

The 2011 season also marked the departure of Kurtis Haiu, who was diagnosed with a bone tumour in April. Following his diagnosis, he took an indefinite break from rugby to focus on his health.

====2012 season====
2012, the team&#x27;s fourth season under coach Pat Lam, saw the arrival of former Hurricanes icons, and 2011 Rugby World Cup winners, Ma&#x27;a Nonu and Piri Weepu. The regular season began on 24 February against the Crusaders at Eden Park. Following two successive losses to start the season, the side&#x27;s first victory came away to the Bulls, with starting debutant Gareth Anscombe scoring all of the Blues points in the 29–23 win. In doing so, Anscombe set a team record for most points in a match. In the same match, Rene Ranger became the first Blues player to receive a white card, which resulted in a two-week suspension. Seven consecutive losses followed, beginning with the Stormers in round four, and finishing with the Hurricanes in round eleven. Growing frustration among fans was evident during this period, with racist remarks directed at coach Pat Lam via social media, talkback radio and the Blues own website. Lam, who is of Samoan descent, received support from a number of former Blues players during this period, including Michael Jones and Eroni Clarke. After beating the Lions in round twelve, the Blues suffered the biggest defeat in club history with a 59 – 12 loss away to the Crusaders, which was followed by losses at home to the Highlanders and table-topping Chiefs. The Blues finished the season on a high note, with wins against the Western Force and Brumbies.

On 17 July, Pat Lam was released. On the same day, Sir John Kirwan was appointed as head coach for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. In August, the Blues&#x27; full coaching staff for the 2013 season was announced, with Sir Graham Henry taking on a role as technical advisor and defensive coach, Mick Byrne appointed forwards and kicking coach, and Grant Doorey appointed skills and backline coach.

====2013 season====
The 2013 season saw an all new Blues team with many players leaving, including Ma&#x27;a Nonu to the Highlanders and Gareth Anscombe to the Chiefs. On the morning of 31 October 2012 new coach Sir John Kirwan announced the 2013 Blues squad which included 14 Super Rugby debutants, and Ali Williams taking over as captain. Handed a bye on the first round the Blues started the regular season on 23 February 2013 with a 34–20 away win against the Hurricanes, followed by a 34–15 home win against the Crusaders the next week. Three consecutive losses followed, including the Bulls&#x27; first victory at Eden Park. The Blues regained some form again, winning four of the next five games. Beating the Highlanders at home and completing the double over the Hurricanes with a 28–6 win at Eden Park before losing a close game against the Reds. The Blues then defeated both the Stormers and the Rebels before losing 3 games in a row to the Crusaders, Brumbies, and Highlanders respectively. The Blues then travelled to South Africa with two must win games against the Sharks and the Cheetahs, unfortunately losing both and ending the Blues chances of making the play-offs. Ali Williams played his 100th game for the Blues against the Sharks. The Blues returned to New Zealand with a last home game against the already play-off qualified Chiefs. Despite a red card to Kane Barrett for stomping in the 23rd minute, the Blues played a remarkably strong game, taking the lead just after half-time but a yellow card to first-five Baden Kerr struck another blow for the Blues. The mounting Chiefs pressure paid off resulting in a Ben Tameifuna try with 17 minutes to go, winning the game for the Chiefs. The Blues walked off the field to a standing ovation from their fans, the first time an Eden Park crowd had been upstanding for a defeat.

The Blues finished the season in 10th place, with six players earning call-ups to the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, and Frank Halai as the team&#x27;s top try scorer scoring 10 tries in his debut season. They signed international super star Benji Marshall for the 2014 season (only to return to league with the Dragons halfway through it) and Ma&#x27;a Nonu for two seasons starting in 2014.

====2014 season====
The Blues 2014 season started with coach Sir John Kirwan announcing six new players to the squad including three All Blacks with the return of Ma&#x27;a Nonu and Tony Woodcock after they both played with the Highlanders for a season, and Jerome Kaino. This also included former National Rugby League (NRL) player Benji Marshall who had previously played with the Wests Tigers for 10 years.

The Blues season started with an away loss to the Highlanders, going down 29–21. The next week they played their first home game of the season at Eden Park, defeating the Crusaders 35–24. They travelled to South Africa for two games against the Sharks and the Lions, losing both games but coming away with a losing bonus point against the Lions. They returned to New Zealand for two home games against the Cheetahs and the Highlanders, both of which they won bringing the up to 6th place on the ladder. The team travelled to Canberra to face the Brumbies and were defeated 26–9, and were defeated again by the Hurricanes in Wellington after a bye week. This was followed by two home games against the Waratahs and the Reds, winning both and coming away with a bonus point win against the Reds. They then lost their next two games going down to the Chiefs and the Sharks, picking up a losing bonus point against the Sharks. They returned to Eden park to defeat the Hurricanes, followed by a bonus point win in Perth against the Western Force. This put them into 8th place on the ladder with two games to play in the regular season before finals, needing to place in the top 6 for a spot in the play-offs. They lost to the Crusaders in Christchurch, therefore to make the finals they needed to win their final game against the Chiefs who were in the same situation. They lost their final game against the Chiefs going down 11–8, putting them out of the finals and ending a six-game winning streak at Eden Park for the season. The Blues finished 10th overall and 5th place in the New Zealand conference.

Ihaia West, Patrick Tuipulotu, Benji Marshall, and Tom Donnelly all made their Super Rugby debut for the Blues in the 2014 season.

====2015 season====
The 2015 season started with coach Sir John Kirwan announcing the Blues squad, with the inclusion of 11 new players after losing 12 players including Ma&#x27;a Nonu and Piri Weepu, who both played over 100 super rugby games.

The Blues season started with a loss to the Chiefs, going down 23–18, picking up a losing bonus point. This was followed by an unsuccessful tour of South Africa, going down to the Stormers and Cheetahs, coming away with a single bonus point from a 25–24 loss to the Cheetahs. This was followed by four consecutive losses against the Lions, Hurricanes, Waratahs and Chiefs, 3 of which they picked up a losing bonus point. Their first win of the season came against the Brumbies at Eden Park with a 16–14 victory, ending the Blues 9 game losing streak. This was followed by consecutive losses against the Highlanders and Crusaders, picking up a bonus point against the Highlanders. This was followed by a strong 41–24 win against the Force. Their next game against the Rebels was their final away game of the season, they lost 42–22, ending the season with no away wins, having only won two away games in the last three years. Their final four games were all at home with high hopes of finishing the season on a high. They won the first game 23–18 against the South African conference leaders the Bulls, however this was their last win of the season going down in their final three games against the Hurricanes, Crusaders and Highlanders. This ended the franchises worst super rugby season, ending in 14th place ahead of the Force, with just 3 from 16 wins for the season.

The end of the season was marked by the resignation of coach Sir John Kirwan, who had been with the team for the last three years winning just 17 out of 58 games. The Blues signed former All Black captain Tana Umaga to replace Sir John Kirwan as head coach of the Blues.

====2016 season====
The Blues endured yet another disappointing year in 2016, although there were some improvements. A close first round win over the Highlanders by 33–31 was followed by successive losses to the Crusaders (28–13) and Hurricanes (19–23). A 25–25 draw with the Reds in Round 4 was followed by a 24–16 win over the Jaguares in Round 6 (Round 5 being a bye). A week later the Blues lost to the Chiefs by 23–29, but bounced back with wins over the Sharks (23–18), Rebels (36–30) and Kings (34–18). A 43–5 loss to eventual finalists the Lions was followed by a tight 17–13 win over the Force. Another tight game resulted in a 21–26 loss to the Crusaders, while a yet another loss followed against the Hurricanes 27–37. Dominant wins against the Brumbies (40–15) and Waratahs (34–28) showed that the Blues could still be highly competitive, however their last-place conference finish left them outside the qualification pool for the season´s semi-finals, with rival New Zealand franchise the Hurricanes emerging the eventual champions.

====2017 season====
2017 again saw the Blues finish bottom of the New Zealand conference, with an even 7 wins and 7 losses to their credit. The up and down nature of their season was reflected in the margins of both their biggest win – 56–18 in Round 1 over the Rebels – and their heaviest defeat – 48–21 to the Sunwolves in the final round in Tokyo. During the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour, the Blues pulled off a shock win over the British and Irish Lions 22–26 at Eden Park. Rookie Blues winger Reiko Ioane distinguished himself during the match, scoring a try and notably outpacing Lions and England winger Elliot Daly. Blues reserve first-five Ihaia West and All Black centre Sonny Bill Williams also impressed during the match, both scoring tries and West adding a penalty and conversion to a remarkable result against the tourists.

====2018 season====

2018 would see the Blues again finish last in their conference, with a poor record of only four wins vs 12 losses in a miserable season. Crushing losses to the Hurricanes (42–24) and Crusaders (54–17) in the last two rounds illustrated how far the team´s performances had collapsed from coach Tana Umaga´s first, relatively respectable season in charge, and emphasized the need for structural reform at the club. A reshuffle resulted in Umaga being demoted to an assistant coaching role, and the appointment of former All Black, Crusaders assistant and Tasman Mako head coach Leon MacDonald as new Blues coach the following season.

====2019 season====

MacDonald´s first year in charge saw little in the way of definite improvements to the Blues win–loss record, with only 5 wins from 17 games giving them their sixth consecutive last-place finish in the New Zealand conference. All Black prop Karl Tu&#x27;inukuafe and former All Black Ma&#x27;a Nonu were recruited from the Chiefs and Toulon, respectively. While their overall standards had improved, their margins of both victory and defeat remaining consistently low, the Blues were unable to mount much of a challenge that season.

====2020 season====
Due to the COVID 19 Global Pandemic there was no international Super Rugby competition held in 2020 – with the competition instead delivered via 3 local conferences ie. Australia, NZ and South Africa. In the NZ Conference, Super Rugby Aotearoa, the Blues had a significantly improved season, winning five of their seven games and claiming fourth position at the end of the season.

====2021 season====

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was wholly regionalised, with the 2021 Super Rugby Aotearoa season and the 2021 Super Rugby AU season replacing the previous 15 side format used from 2018 till 2020. Super Rugby Trans-Tasman followed these tournaments, a crossover competition that featured the five Australian sides playing the five New Zealand sides.

The Blues won 4 of their 8 games, finishing the 2021 season in 3rd place, in the 6 team NZ based competition.

====2022 Season====

The Blues participated in the first Super Rugby Pacific season in 2022, and finished first in the 12 team round robin. In round 9 they scored their first win in Christchurch over the Crusaders since 2004, winning 27–24 at Orangetheory Stadium. In round 15 they beat the Warratahs 20–17, by a Zarn Sullivan drop goal after the 80 minute mark. This marked the franchise&#x27;s 13th straight win, the longest in franchise history. In the quarter-finals, they played the Highlanders, who they beat 35–6, to reach their first semi-final in 11 years. In the semi-finals, they beat the Brumbies 20–19 in a thrilling encounter. Brumbies first-five Noah Lolesio had a match winning drop goal attempt, but this was charged down by Blues prop Ofa Tu&#x27;ungafasi, in turn sending the Blues to their first final since 2003, where they were defeated by the Crusaders 21–7 in front of a packed out Eden Park.

==Rivalries==
Overall the Blues have dated rivalries with all other New Zealand-based Super Rugby teams (Chiefs, Hurricanes, Crusaders and Highlanders), however a notable trophy is contested between the Blues and Highlanders. The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy is contested between the Blues and Highlanders as a part of regular season fixtures between the two sides. The trophy is awarded in memory of Gordon Hunter, who had been head coach of both teams prior to his passing away in 2002.

==Stadium==

The team&#x27;s primary home ground is Eden Park, located in the central Auckland suburb of Kingsland. The stadium has a capacity of 50,000. In addition to hosting Blues home matches, the ground is the home of the Auckland Rugby Football Union and Auckland Cricket, and is a frequent host of All Blacks matches, and hosted the 2011 Rugby World Cup semi-finals, third-place playoff, and final.

In addition to Eden Park, Blues home matches are occasionally held at North Harbour Stadium, home of the North Harbour Rugby Union, and Okara Park, home of the Northland Rugby Union.

==Franchise area and ownership==

The Blues represent the Auckland, North Harbour, and Northland rugby unions. As of 2021 60% of the club is owned (divided 65%, 29% and 6%) by the three unions, through Rugby Holdings Ltd., and 40% by private consortium Better Blues Company Limited. The previous Blues (and Auckland Rugby Football Union) CEO was Michael Redman, who was formerly CEO of the New Zealand Breakers basketball team. The current board is made up of six members. Don Mackinnon, also a former New Zealand Netball and High Performance Sport NZ director, took over in 2019 as Blues Chairman from Tony Carter who chaired the board since it became a stand-alone organisation in 2013. The current board includes John Hart, Sam Lotu-liga, Richard Dellabarca, Kate Daly, Grant Graham and Brian Wilsher.

Andrew Hore took up the top job as CEO of the Blues in October 2019. Hore beat off serious competition from 70 applicants to become Blues CEO and believes glory days can return to the team&#x27;s home ground of Eden Park. Hore was previously CEO at the Ospreys in Wales before going on to turn around the New South Wales Waratahs and NSW Rugby before deciding it was time to return to New Zealand to the Blues&#x27; challenge.

<text>William Dickson Boyce (June 16, 1858 – June 11, 1929) was an American newspaper man, entrepreneur, magazine publisher, and explorer. He was the founder of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and the short-lived Lone Scouts of America (LSA). Born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, he acquired a love for the outdoors early in his life. After working as a schoolteacher and a coal miner, Boyce attended Wooster Academy in Ohio before moving to the Midwest and Canada. An astute businessman, Boyce successfully established several newspapers, such as &quot;The Commercial&quot; in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the &quot;Lisbon Clipper&quot; in Lisbon, North Dakota. With his first wife, Mary Jane Beacom, he moved to Chicago to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions. There he established the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company and the weekly &quot;Saturday Blade&quot;, which catered to a rural audience and was distributed by thousands of newspaper boys. With his novel employment of newsboys to boost newspaper sales, Boyce&#x27;s namesake publishing company maintained a circulation of 500,000 copies per week by 1894. Boyce strongly supported worker rights, as demonstrated by his businesses&#x27; support of labor unions and his concern for his newsboys&#x27; well-being.

By the early years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken a step back from his businesses to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun.

Boyce learned about Scouting while passing through London during his first expedition to Africa in 1909. According to somewhat fictionalized legend, Boyce had become lost in the dense London fog, but was guided back to his destination by a young boy, who told him that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Boyce then read printed material on Scouting, and on his return to the United States, he formed the B.S.A.

From its start, Boyce focused the Scouting program on teaching self-reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order &quot;to make men&quot;. After clashing over the Scouting program with the first Chief Scout Executive James E. West, he left the B.S.A. and founded the L.S.A. in January 1915, which catered to rural boys who had limited opportunities to form a troop or a patrol.

In June 1924, five years before Boyce&#x27;s death, a merger was completed between the B.S.A. and the struggling L.S.A. Boyce received many awards and memorials for his efforts in the U.S. Scouting movement, including the famed &quot;Silver Buffalo Award&quot;.

==Personal life and family==
Boyce was born on June 16, 1858, in New Texas, Pennsylvania – now Plum Borough —to a Presbyterian farm couple, David and Margaret Jane Bratton Boyce. The Boyces had three children: William Dickson, Mary, and John. During his rural childhood, Boyce acquired a love for the outdoors. He began teaching school at the age of 16 and then worked briefly as a coal miner. He returned to teaching before joining his sister at Wooster Academy in Ohio, which—according to school records—he attended from 1880 to 1881. It is uncertain if he graduated or was expelled.

He then worked as a teacher, lumberjack, secretary, and salesman in the Midwest and Canada before settling in Chicago, where he quickly became known as a persuasive and shrewd salesman and learned business quickly. His books on business, travel, and expeditions often used the phrase &quot;We pushed on.&quot; On January 1, 1884, Boyce married Mary Jane Beacom (1865–1959), whom he had known since his Pennsylvania childhood. Boyce called her Betsy, but to many her nickname was &quot;Rattlesnake Jane&quot; because she matched his skill in poker, was an expert shot, and rode horses cross saddle. It had also become obvious that she was more masculine than Boyce himself, although he had never admitted this, it became clear out of his journal.
 They had one son and two daughters: Benjamin Stevens (1884–1928), Happy (1886–1976) and Sydney (1889–1950).

Boyce&#x27;s personal activities included hunting, yachting, Odd Fellows, Freemasonry, Shriners, golf, country clubs and the Chicago Hussars—an independent equestrian military organization.

In 1903, Boyce purchased a four-story mansion on in Ottawa, Illinois, which became the center of his family and social activities. Thereafter, he showed little interest in Chicago and its social activities; he would only go there on business. Boyce and Mary led increasingly separate lives and eventually divorced, which was reported on the front page of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; because of the prominence he had attained by that time. The divorce was finalized in a Campbell County, South Dakota court in September 1908; his wife&#x27;s property settlement was close to $1 million (USD).

After the divorce was finalized, Boyce courted Virginia Dorcas Lee, a vocalist from Oak Park, Illinois, who was 23 years his junior and the eldest child of Virginia and John Adams Lee, a former Lieutenant Governor of Missouri. Both Virginia&#x27;s parents and Boyce&#x27;s son Ben opposed the relationship. In May 1910, after the planned marriage was announced, an infuriated Ben scuffled with his father outside the Blackstone Hotel and Boyce sustained a facial wound. Ben was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $5 and court costs. Two days later, Boyce and Virginia married and went to Europe on an extended honeymoon. Almost immediately, there was speculation amongst family members and in newspapers about problems within the marriage. On April 9, 1911, Boyce and Virginia had a daughter, whom they named Virginia. A few months later, in December 1911, Boyce signed an agreement to support and educate their infant daughter. After Boyce&#x27;s wife filed for divorce in March 1912, she moved to Santa Barbara, California, with their daughter and her parents. Boyce did not contest the divorce and arranged for a $100,000 settlement. Years later, the elder Virginia married Richard Roberts, a New York banker, and moved with her and Boyce&#x27;s daughter to Greenwich, Connecticut. The younger Virginia took the surname Roberts. She did not meet her natural father, Boyce, until she was eight years old.

Ben married Miriam Patterson of Omaha, Nebraska, on June 11, 1912. Both Boyce and his first wife attended the ceremony. At this time Boyce&#x27;s first wife, Mary, exchanged some of her Chicago property for the home in Ottawa, which sparked speculation that she and Boyce might reconcile. The next year they remarried on June 14, 1913, in Ottawa. They then departed on a honeymoon to Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, Panama, and Cuba, with their daughter Happy, son Ben, and his wife Miriam.

==Business enterprises==
As Boyce traveled, he often started a newspaper wherever he went. His first venture into commercial publishing was compiling a city directory. He also worked briefly for a publisher in Columbus, Ohio, and a newspaper publisher in Kensington, Pennsylvania, part of Philadelphia. He then boarded a train for Chicago and worked as a secretary and salesman for &quot;Western&quot; magazine. Restless again, he moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and sold advertisements for a publisher for a short time and then spent a month in Fargo, North Dakota, and Grand Forks, North Dakota. Further north in Canada, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he and local resident James W. Steen co-founded &quot;The Commercial&quot; in 1881, a newspaper that lasted for 70 years. He sold his share of &quot;The Commercial&quot; to his partner in 1882 and returned to Fargo where he became a reporter. In December 1882, Boyce moved to Lisbon, North Dakota, where he bought the &quot;Dakota Clipper&quot;.

Beginning in December 1884, Boyce managed reporters and news releases at the &quot;Bureau of Correspondence&quot; at the six-month-long World&#x27;s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in New Orleans, Louisiana. Countries from all over the world sent displays. Boyce was responsible for providing news stories on events and displays to over 1,200 newspapers around the country. He returned to North Dakota after the Exposition concluded, but by early 1886 he had moved back to Chicago. He often returned in North Dakota for publishing business deals and deer- and duck-hunting vacations.

In Chicago, he founded the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which provided advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers. In 1887, he established the weekly &quot;Saturday Blade&quot;, an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys—an innovation at the time. By 1892, the &quot;Saturday Blade&quot; had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States. Boyce&#x27;s detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the &quot;Saturday Blade&quot; and were reprinted in books by atlas/map publisher Rand McNally. The success of the &quot;Saturday Blade&quot; spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892, Boyce bought out the &quot;Chicago Ledger&quot;, a fiction weekly publication. In January 1903 he founded the international &quot;Boyce&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, which advocated worker&#x27;s rights. Boyce&#x27;s prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor/union leaders such as John Mitchell of the United Mine Workers and Henry Demarest Lloyd as writers and editors for &quot;Boyce&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Eight months later, &quot;Boyce&#x27;s Weekly&quot; was consolidated with the &quot;Saturday Blade.&quot; Boyce also established the selected subject/topical newspapers &quot;Farm Business&quot; in 1914 and &quot;Home Folks Magazine&quot; in 1922. Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the &quot;Blade&quot; and &quot;Ledger&quot; into the monthly &quot;Chicago Blade &amp; Ledger&quot;, which was published until 1937. As Boyce&#x27;s enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him gain an understanding of America&#x27;s youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money. Boyce&#x27;s focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: &quot;There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all. Help yourself and others will help you.&quot; and &quot;whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished&quot;.

In 1891, Boyce began working on his own 12-story office building at 30 North Dearborn Street, known as the &quot;Boyce Building&quot;, it was designed by architect Henry Ives Cobb. Even 20 years later, this building was recognized as the most expensive building (in terms of dollars per cubic foot) in Chicago. In 1907, Boyce consolidated his business operations into another office building, also known as the Boyce Building, at 500–510 North Dearborn Street. A new four-story office building—designed by the architectural firm of Daniel Burnham—was built on this location in 1912 and expanded during 1913–14 with an additional six stories. This building was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 29, 1996, maintained by the United States Department of the Interior and its National Park Service.

At a time when women had trouble finding work and workers were often oppressed, Boyce felt their rights were important: his businesses employed many women and he supported labor unions. His newspapers often carried stories about the &quot;nobility of labor&quot;. His businesses were able to pay out wages and benefits during the Panic of 1893, a time when many businesses were laying off workers and cutting wages. During the Pullman Strike of the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1894, which spread to 20 companies in over half the states, Boyce called Eugene V. Debs, the socialist labor national leader of the American Railway Union, a &quot;great labor leader&quot; and industrialist George Pullman, inventor of the railroad passenger and sleeping car, the man &quot;who caused all the trouble&quot; (the then-current labor and social/political strife of the 1890s). In 1901 when the Boyce Paper Manufacturing Company in Marseilles, Illinois, burned down, he paid the workers immediately and then hired them back as construction workers to rebuild the paper mill so they would not lose income. Yet, he was also protective of his money. In late 1894, when two of his workers were injured by a fallen smokestack and won $2,000 each in a court judgment, Boyce appealed the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Illinois, and lost. He was also persistent in getting what he wanted; in 1902, he sued the Marseilles Land and Power Company for not supplying enough water power to his mills and won a $65,300 judgment. By 1903, the Marseilles Land and Power Company fell into receivership and Boyce bought up the company.

Boyce hired his son, Ben, when he was 20 years old, giving him high-level positions in his water and power businesses in and around Marseilles and Ottawa. However, their relationship was often strained by Boyce&#x27;s high expectations and Ben&#x27;s carelessness with his funds in activities such as betting on horse races.

During June–August 1906, the government proposed quadrupling the postage rate for second-class mail, which included newspapers, from one cent to four cents per pound. In response, Boyce proposed buying the Post Office Department for $300 million (USD), claiming that he would reduce postal rates by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the United States Department of the Treasury for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent. This offer was rejected by the government, but it did halt their planned second-class postage rate increase.

Boyce was a multi-millionaire by the early 1900s and by 1909 became more interested in civic affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, especially his son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These changes may have been in part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife, Mary Jane, were separating.

In 1914 Boyce bought two more newspapers, the &quot;Indianapolis Sun&quot;, which he renamed the &quot;Indianapolis Daily Times&quot;, and the &quot;Inter Ocean Farmer&quot;, which he renamed &quot;The Farming Business&quot;. By 1920, the majority of Americans lived in cities instead of rural areas. &quot;Lone Scout&quot;, &quot;Saturday Blade&quot;, and &quot;Chicago Ledger&quot; all focused on rural customers and began to falter. Boyce launched &quot;Home Folks Magazine&quot; in an attempt to regain customers. By June 1925, sales had slipped so much that he merged the latter two titles into the &quot;Blade and Ledger&quot;, which caused sales to rise again. This encouraged Boyce to start &quot;Movie Romances&quot;, one of the first tabloid magazines about movie star romances.

Boyce&#x27;s success in the publishing business lay in his ability to organize the administration of a business and delegate details to subordinates. He eventually amassed a fortune of about US$20 million. Boyce&#x27;s life paralleled Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s in many ways: Both men were products of the Progressive Era, internationally prominent, had concern for children, supported Scouting, were adventurers and outdoorsmen, (modern-day &quot;environmentalists&quot;), and were interested in civic reform. Although Boyce admired and sought to surpass Roosevelt, his only foray into politics was the 1896 Republican primary for a United States representative (congressman) in the U.S. House of Representatives – a bitterly fought campaign which he lost to first-term incumbent George E. Foss. In all likelihood, Boyce met Roosevelt at the Union League Club of Chicago, of which the former had become a member in 1891. His ambivalent attitude towards government was a common one of the general public during the Progressive Era. However, Boyce&#x27;s Republican credentials and monetary contributions earned him an invitation to the presidential inauguration and ball of newly elected successor to &quot;T.R.&quot;, the 27th President, William Howard Taft in March 1909.

==Expeditions==
Boyce financed an expedition of the explorer Frederick Schwatka to Alaska in 1896. Schwatka discovered gold near Nome and Boyce reported this success in his newspapers, which led him to finance other Schwatka expeditions as well as those of other adventurers, including a failed expedition to the Yukon River in 1898. Boyce soon began to carry out his own expeditions. When the United States entered the Spanish–American War in 1898, Boyce set sail for Cuban waters aboard the ship &quot;Three Friends&quot;. The nature of the activities of Boyce and this ship are unknown.

In March 1909, Boyce embarked on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence&#x27;s son Raymond were part of the expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The expedition was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.

In December 1910, Boyce led a nine-month, expedition to South America that was extensively reported in his newspapers. In late January 1915, Boyce sailed to England because of his concern over World War I. He received permission from the American Legation in Switzerland to travel into Germany and Austria for six weeks to report on the industrial and commercial effects of the war on those countries. He sent extensive reports to his newspapers and returned home around April–May.

In late 1922, Boyce departed on another expedition to Africa, this time for six months. Morocco reminded him of the Dakotas, Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In Egypt he visited the tomb of Tutankhamun, which had been discovered just a few months earlier. His expedition then went to Luxor and sailed up the Nile River to Edfu, where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed for the first time in decades. Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal.

==Scouting==
As Boyce&#x27;s interest in philanthropy grew, he turned to his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while &quot;en route&quot; to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.

===Unknown Scout legend===
According to legend, Boyce was lost on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout came to his aid, guiding him back to his destination. The boy then refused Boyce&#x27;s tip, explaining that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Boyce was so impressed by the boy&#x27;s actions that it inspired him to bring Scouting to America. Soon thereafter, Boyce met with Robert Baden-Powell, who was the head of the Boy Scout Association at that time. Boyce returned to America, and, four months later, founded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. He intended to base the program around American Indian lore. This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines. There are several variations of it, including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before this encounter and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters.

In actuality, Boyce stopped in London &quot;en route&quot; to a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout headquarters and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce&#x27;s request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of &quot;Scouting For Boys&quot; and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce&#x27;s original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.

===Boy Scouts of America===

The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on February 8, 1910, but it struggled from shortages of cash and leadership in the beginning. Boyce personally donated $1,000 a month to keep the organization running on the condition that boys of all races and creeds be included. He was not interested in directing the organization, and turned over the running of the organization to Edgar M. Robinson of the YMCA, who proceeded to recruit the permanent executive board of the BSA. The much-needed leadership and management arrived when the Sons of Daniel Boone and Woodcraft Indians merged with the BSA.

Boyce felt that Scouting&#x27;s emphasis on outdoor activity was crucial in producing the type of leaders that America needed because youth reared in cities had too much done for them, whereas those from the country had to learn to do things for themselves. Scouting was focused on teaching self-reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order &quot;to make men&quot;.

===Lone Scouts of America===
Boyce clashed with James E. West, the BSA&#x27;s Chief Scout Executive, over a program for boys who lived too far from town to join a troop. Boyce offered to publish a magazine for the BSA, as long as it was published in Chicago. The National Executive Board of the BSA turned this offer down and shortly thereafter Boyce ceased being active in administrative activities of the BSA, though he remained a staunch supporter of the program. As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself did when he was young, Boyce started a new Scouting-related venture: the Lone Scouts of America (LSA) on January 9, 1915. Reliance on Native American themes gave LSA a distinct Native American flavor: Lone Scouts could form small groups known as &quot;tribes&quot;, the tribe&#x27;s treasurer was known as the &quot;wampum-bearer&quot;, and LSA taught boys to respect the environment. Boyce&#x27;s annual contribution to the LSA grew to $100,000. In both the BSA and the LSA, Boyce was a manager and had little direct contact with the Boy Scouts. Upon his return from reporting on World War I, Boyce immediately began expanding the LSA by starting &quot;Lone Scout&quot; magazine and hiring Frank Allan Morgan, a noted Chicago Scoutmaster, to lead the LSA. By November 1915, the LSA had over 30,000 members. Warren conferred upon Boyce the title &quot;Chief Totem&quot;. Youths could join the LSA simply by mailing in some coupons and five cents. By 1916, the BSA and the LSA were in direct competition for members. In the summer of 1917, during his annual Dakota hunt, the Gros Ventres Indian tribe made Boyce an honorary chief with the name &quot;Big Cloud&quot; during a three-day ceremony. With America at war, Boyce agreed to the creation of a Lone Scout uniform in late 1917. Though he had a uniform made for himself, he stipulated that no Lone Scout was required to purchase one.

Boyce felt that &quot;Lone Scout&quot; was the best magazine he had ever done. &quot;Lone Scout&quot; was so popular that it could not handle all the material that was submitted, so many local and regional &quot;Tribe Papers&quot; were started. By 1922, Boyce&#x27;s newspaper business was suffering and &quot;Lone Scout&quot; was losing money—it switched from a weekly to a monthly. Boyce&#x27;s racial prejudice was revealed when the racial tensions in Chicago increased in the 1920s. The LSA issued a formal proclamation in late 1920 that it would only accept whites and in 1922 changed the masthead of &quot;Lone Scout&quot; from &quot;A Real Boys&#x27; Magazine&quot; to &quot;The White Boys Magazine&quot;.

The fortunes of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for &quot;Lone Scout&quot;, George N. Madison. Madison discovered that the LSA&#x27;s membership roster was wildly inaccurate: it was full of duplications and inactive members. The reported 490,000 Lone Scouts in 1922 was a vastly inflated number. Boyce finally accepted West&#x27;s annual offer to merge with the BSA in April 1924, with the merger formalized on June 16, 1924. Some Lone Scouts did not transfer to the BSA, but the BSA continued Lone Scouting as a separate division for another decade, gradually losing its unique programs. Present day Lone Scouts use the standard Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting programs and activities, but are not part of a pack or troop on a regular basis because of factors such as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties.

==Legacy==

Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 of a heart embolism. His father did not arrive home until after his son&#x27;s death. Boyce was so saddened over his son&#x27;s death that his own health suffered. One of Boyce&#x27;s last efforts was to publish his son&#x27;s letters from his South Seas expeditions: &quot;Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea&quot;. Boyce died from bronchial pneumonia on June 11, 1929, in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois, on June 13, 1929, in the Ottawa Avenue Cemetery, with West delivering the eulogy. Boy Scouts maintained an honor guard with an American flag in a heavy rainstorm in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers. BSA officials sent his widow a telegram that said the entire American nation owed him a debt of gratitude. A statue that commemorates his contribution to the Boy Scouts of America was placed near his grave on June 21, 1941, which West dedicated.

Two plaques in Boyce&#x27;s honor can be found at the southeast corner of the Boyce Building in Chicago&#x27;s River North neighborhood. One honors the building as the site where the Boy Scouts of America was incorporated, and the other honors the Boyce&#x27;s creation of the Lone Scouts of America and its Lone Scout Magazine in the building. The building itself is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Boyce was recognized with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926, the first year it was awarded, for his efforts in starting the BSA. He was the third recipient, after Baden-Powell and the Unknown Scout. During the BSA&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1960, 15,000 Scouts and several of Boyce&#x27;s descendants gathered in Ottawa for a Boyce Memorial weekend. Illinois governor William Stratton delivered the key address and Bridge Street was renamed Boyce Memorial Drive. In 1985, about 2,500 Scouts attended a 75th anniversary pilgrimage in Ottawa, attended by his last surviving child, Virginia, and the Union League of Chicago named Boyce its first Hall of Fame member. Boyce had been a member from 1891 until he died. On December 6, 1997, a Scouting museum opened in Ottawa. The W. D. Boyce Council of the BSA is named in his honor. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker located on Boyce Campus of Community College of Allegheny County in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, recognizes his achievements to Scouting. Not far from the marker is a county park, Boyce Park, that was named for him. A medallion of Boyce is near the White House as part of The Extra Mile – Points of Light Volunteer Pathway. In 2005, the BSA introduced the William D. Boyce New Unit Organization Award, presented to the organizer of any new Scouting unit.

The Extra Mile National Monument in Washington, DC selected Boyce as one of its 37 honorees. The Extra Mile pays homage to Americans like Boyce who set their own self-interest aside to help others and successfully brought positive social change to the United States.

<text>Greenfield Park is a former city in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is currently a borough of the city of Longueuil. It covers an area of , with a population of 16,733 at the 2016 census of Canada. Greenfield Park is the only borough of Longueuil that has an officially bilingual status. It is primarily a post-WWI suburban area. Like the other two boroughs, most of the buildings in Greenfield Park are single-family homes. Nearly all of the land in Greenfield Park is built on, making it Longueuil&#x27;s most densely populated borough.

Greenfield Park is divided into two sections. The older section of the borough is to the west of Taschereau Boulevard near Saint-Lambert, LeMoyne and Brossard, while the newer section is to the east, near the Saint-Hubert borough. Most of the Greenfield Park&#x27;s businesses are located along Taschereau Boulevard, the south shore&#x27;s most important commercial artery. The Charles LeMoyne Hospital, located on the Taschereau Boulevard, is the largest on the south shore.

==History==
===Seigneury of Longueuil===
Before becoming a town, the area known as Greenfield Park was land belonging to the Seigneury of Longueuil. It had been an agricultural area up until the end of the 19th century. Greenfield Park benefited from its proximity to neighbouring St. Lambert&#x27;s rail line connected to the newly constructed Victoria Bridge, which was the only major rail link between Montreal and the South Shore. At the time, the bridge was the longest railway bridge in the world. Development had begun to spread into Greenfield Park, which merited the establishment of a town to provide services for the population.

===Town===
Greenfield Park was named after the area&#x27;s primary geographical features, which were in fact green fields and forests. The town was established on March 24, 1911. The original &quot;Charter of Greenfield Park&quot; gave reasoning for the town&#x27;s creation:

&quot;Whereas the rate-payers of the territory comprised in cadastral lots Nos . 225 to 244 of the parish of Longueuil have by a large majority in number and value represented that, in consequence of the rapid increase of population within the said territory being a suburb of the city of Montreal and in consequence of the necessity for local improvements similar to those of other suburbs of Montreal, it is necessary that the said territory be created into a separate municipality and they have prayed, that the general principles of the Cities and Towns&#x27; Act be applied to the said municipality and also that they be granted several powers similar to those of other suburbs of Montreal which are not contained in said act . . .&quot;

With the creation of the town came to need to put infrastructure and services in place. The only way for citizens to reach nearby Montreal was by rail, through the Grand Trunk Railway or the Montreal and Southern Counties Railway. In 1913, Greenfield Park, along with neighbouring municipalities St. Lambert, Montreal South and Longueuil, built a shared sewer system and water filtration plant. The town also used artesian wells as a source for drinking water.

===World War I and II===
During World War I, such a high percentage of Greenfield Parkers served in the Canadian forces that regular town meetings could not be held. Similarly, in World War II, Greenfield Park was the Canadian community that had one of the highest participation rate of military volunteers for its size. This fact was recognized by both Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Minister of National Defence, J.L. Ralston.

Following the war, returning veterans were able to purchase homes with financial assistance through a purchasing program put into place by the town.

===Late 20th Century===
In the early 1960s, Greenfield Park acquired 40 percent more land by annexing part of Saint-Hubert. This land was located on the opposite side of Taschereau, and a large amount of veterans housing was built on these lands, particularly along Bellevue Street North. During the early 60s, over 60% of the town&#x27;s population traced their ancestry to the United Kingdom, roughly half of that number live in the town today.

===Merger with Longueuil===
Greenfield Park was a town until January 1, 2002, when it along with several other suburbs on Montreal&#x27;s South Shore were merged into the amalgamated city of Longueuil. (On January 1, 2006, Boucherville, Brossard, Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville and Saint-Lambert were &quot;demerged&quot;, or reconstituted.) Following these demergers, Greenfield Park became one of only three remaining boroughs of Longueuil, along with Saint-Hubert and Le Vieux-Longueuil.

==Government==
===Municipal===
Greenfield Park is represented by one city councillor in Longueuil City Council and two borough councillors. The borough president is Sylvain Joly of Option Greenfield Park. As of the November 7, 2021 Longueuil municipal election (see 2021 Quebec municipal elections#Longueuil), the current borough council consists of the following councillors:
;Coat of Arms
Greenfield Park&#x27;s coat of arms is golden, with a sable reversed chevron. The chevron supports a sinople coloured tree. Below the chevron are two red roses. Above the shield is a crown, shaped like a wall with five turrets. The shield is surrounded by branches of maple. Below the shield the branches meet, tied with a red and black ribbon. The Greenfield Park motto, &quot;Fortis Fortunam Superat,&quot; or &quot;Fortune Favors the Brave,&quot; is attributed to Villar.

===Federal and provincial===
Greenfield Park is in the federal riding of Longueuil—Charles-LeMoyne and its Member of Parliament is Sherry Romanado (Liberal Party of Canada). It also belongs to the provincial riding of Laporte and its Member of the National Assembly is Nicole Ménard (Quebec Liberal Party).

<doc id="647345" wikidata="Q586617" url="?curid=647345" title="Chiefs (Super Rugby)">
<text>The Chiefs (; formerly known as the Waikato Chiefs and officially called the Gallagher Chiefs for sponsorship reasons) are a New Zealand professional rugby union team based in Hamilton, Waikato. The team competes in the Super Rugby Pacific competition, previously known as the Super 12 and Super 14, and are one of the competition&#x27;s five New Zealand teams. Their primary home ground is FMG Stadium Waikato.

The Chiefs are central to six provincial teams; Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki and Counties Manukau playing in the National Provincial Championship (NPC), with Thames Valley and King Country competing in the Heartland Championship.

The Chiefs field three main teams, the Gallagher Chiefs who compete in DHL Super Rugby Pacific, the Chiefs Manawa who compete in Sky Super Rugby Aupiki and their age-group team the University of Waikato Chiefs U20s.

The Chiefs teams play in red, black and yellow colours with jerseys in recent years having strong Māori cultural elements to tie the club to its region. Māori culture, values and traditions are also a cornerstone of the club’s culture, implemented during Dave Rennie’s time as head coach and continued by current head coach Clayton McMillan.

Until 2004, the Chiefs were the only New Zealand side never to have qualified for the Super 12 semi-finals. In that year the Chiefs earned their first semi-final berth, and in the end achieved fourth place (defeated 37–20 in the semi-final by the ACT Brumbies). They subsequently reached the 2009 final, but found themselves on the short end of a record 61–17 defeat by the Bulls.

The Chiefs were rewarded with a home final after a strong 2012 season. The Chiefs defeated the 37–6, winning their first title. In 2013, the Chiefs became the fourth team to record back-to-back title wins, when they defeated the Brumbies 27–22 at Waikato Stadium.

In 2021 the Chiefs Rugby Club established their women&#x27;s team, formerly known as the Chiefs women, now the Chiefs Manawa. The Chiefs Manawa won the inaugural season of Sky Super Rugby Aupiki in 2022 and were runner-up in the competition in 2023 and 2024.

==History==
The Chiefs were founded in 1996 as the Waikato Chiefs for the inaugural Super 12 season in 1996. Prior to the Super 12, the Super 10 competition had been in place, which NPC teams took part in, including Waikato. In the first year of competition the Chiefs placed 6th in the overall standings, missing out on making the finals; winning 6 of their 11 regular season matches. The following season the Chiefs placed 11th, winning 4 games and losing 7. In 1998 the Chiefs performed closer to the standard of their 1996 season and placed at 7th in the final standings. In 1999 the side were able to do one better and claimed 6th position on the ladder but were still yet to make the playoffs.

In 2000 the Chiefs won 3 of their regular season games and finished the regular season in 10th place. The following season the team equalled their best position again – finishing 6th. In 2002 the team won 4 games and lost 7 to finish in 8th position, and the season after, 2003 Super 12 season, fell to a 10th-place finish. But the season after, the Chiefs won 7 regular season games and came 4th on the ladder – claiming the first semi-final spot in their history. The Chiefs lost the semi-final against the Brumbies. In 2005 the team finished 6th. In 2006, the Super 12 expanded to the Super 14, with the addition of a new Australian and South African club. The Chiefs won 7 of their 13 games and drew once with 5 losses to come 7th. In 2009, the Chiefs made their second ever semi-final, defeating the 14 – 10 to advance to the final for the first time. They lost the final to the Bulls by the biggest-ever margin of 61–17. In the 2010 and 2011 seasons, they were unable to replicate their form of 2009, missing the playoffs in both seasons.

In 2012, following the disappointing results of previous years, the Chiefs underwent a significant change in personnel. This included the recruitment of new coaches, including Dave Rennie and Wayne Smith, and players, including Aaron Cruden, Ben Tameifuna, Brodie Retallick and Sonny Bill Williams. The changes had an immediate impact as the Chiefs finished at the top of the New Zealand conference, qualifying for a home semi-final, which they won, defeating the 20–17. They subsequently hosted the final for the first time in the teams&#x27;s history, comprehensively defeating the by 37 – 6, claiming their first title. They also set many club records in the 2012 season, including: most home wins, best home streak, best season winning streak, and most points and tries scored.

In 2013, the Chiefs again won the Super Rugby title and the New Zealand conference with a regular-season record of 12 wins and four losses. They also won the BNZ Cup, a new trophy established by the NZRU for the New Zealand side with the best record in intra-conference matches.

In 2016 the Chiefs played a touring Wales side, winning the one-off encounter 40-7. In doing so they became the first New Zealand Super Rugby franchise to defeat an international team.

In 2017 the Chiefs played the British and Irish Lions side in Hamilton, losing the encounter 34-6. In the regular season, they finished 3rd in the NZ conference and 6th overall, putting them through to the playoffs. They won a thriller quarter final against the Stormers in Cape Town (17-11) but lost in the semi-finals to the Crusaders (27-13)

In 2018 the Chiefs finished 3rd in the NZ conference and 5th overall. This result put them through to the quarter-finals, in which they lost a tight battle against the Hurricanes (32-31)

The Chiefs didn&#x27;t have a great start to the 2019 season, losing 4 games straight off the bat, including a loss to the Sunwolves (30-15). However, the Chiefs redeemed themselves by defeating the Bulls 56-20 and going on to win more. They ended up finishing 3rd in the NZ conference and 7th overall, which put them through to the quarter-finals. However, the Chiefs would lose to the Jaguares 21-16 in Buenos Aires

After 7 rounds in 2020, the Chiefs were 3rd in the NZ conference and 5th overall. However, the COVID-19 pandemic suspended the 2020 Super Rugby season from going ahead, for travel and health reasons. Despite this, NZRU created a domestic Super Rugby tournament called Super Rugby Aotearoa, which started in June 2020. The Chiefs played well but didn&#x27;t win a single game in Super Rugby Aotearoa 2020.

The Chiefs lost their first 2 games of Super Rugby Aotearoa in 2021, and then got their first win in the competition against the Hurricanes (35-29). In the 2023 season, the Chiefs won 13 of the 14 regular season matches, going on to host the Crusaders at FMG Stadium Waikato for their first home final since 2013. The Crusaders however remained the Super Rugby Pacific champions winning 25-20.

==Franchise area and ownership==

===Franchise area===
Since 1999, the Chiefs have represented the provincial unions of Bay of Plenty, Counties Manukau, King Country, Thames Valley and Waikato.

From 1996 to 1998 the Chiefs also represented North Harbour and Northland, with Counties Manukau and Thames Valley falling under the Auckland Blues catchment. Had the Blues been allowed to represent the Auckland, North Harbour, Counties Manukau and Northland unions, they would have been able to field almost a full national team due to player contracting rules at the time. In an effort by the NZRU to make things more fair, the Chiefs were given North Harbour and Northland, while the Blues were given Counties Manukau and Thames Valley. By 1999, clear regional dominance of national team players no longer existed, so North Harbour and Northland were &#x27;returned&#x27; to the Blues in exchange for Counties Manukau and Thames Valley.

Taranaki was originally part of the from 1996, but switched to the Chiefs in 2013.

East Coast was also originally part of the Hurricanes from 1996, but as of February 2025 announced they had switched to the Chiefs.

===Ownership===

The Chiefs are a wholly owned subsidiary of the NZRU. However, in an effort to bring more capital into the sport, the NZRU established a system of privatised operation in 2013. In 2014, it was announced that a new entity, &#x27;Chiefs Rugby Club Limited Partnership&#x27;, had been established, with the NZRU granting the newly formed company a seven-year licence, until the end of the 2020 season, to operate the club. Chiefs Rugby Club itself is 50% owned by the provincial unions within the Chiefs&#x27; catchment and 50% by a group of private investors.

===Grounds===
==Development team==
The Chiefs have fielded a development team in competitions such as the Pacific Rugby Cup and in matches against other representative teams for several seasons. Known as the Chiefs Development XV or the Chiefs Taua, the squad is selected from the best emerging rugby talent in the Chiefs catchment area and is composed of Chiefs contracted players, wider training group members, under 20s, and selected club players.

<text>The Hurricanes ( ; ; formerly the Wellington Hurricanes) is a New Zealand professional men&#x27;s rugby union team based in Wellington that competes in Super Rugby. The Hurricanes were formed to represent the lower North Island, including the East Coast, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Horowhenua Kapiti, Manawatū, Poverty Bay, Taranaki, Wairarapa-Bush, Wanganui and Wellington unions. They currently play at Sky Stadium (formerly named Westpac Stadium), having previously played at the now-defunct Athletic Park.

The Hurricanes had a poor first season in 1996&#x27;s Super 12, but rebounded in 1997 with a third placing. The team did not reach the play-offs for another five years as they struggled in the bottom four of the table. Since 2003 the Hurricanes have made the post-season play-offs seven times out of fourteen seasons, including the 2006 final, which they lost in foggy weather against the Crusaders 19–12. After hosting but failing to win the final in 2015, the 2016 season was the Hurricanes&#x27; best season to date. They won the final 20-3 against the Lions, after again finishing the regular season first and hosting the final.

==History==

===Early years: 1996–1997===
The Hurricanes were formed in 1996 as one of five New Zealand Super 12 teams, and were originally called the Wellington Hurricanes. The team&#x27;s first coach was former All Black Frank Oliver, while Bull Allen was named as captain.
Their first match, played at Palmerston North Showgrounds against the Auckland Blues, was the first ever Super 12 match. They lost it 36–28. The team performed below expectations in the inaugural year of the competition and finished ninth. In 1997 the team made the semi-finals, losing in Canberra to the ACT Brumbies. However the consistent form shown during this season would not be seen again for many years.

===Expect the unexpected: 1998–2002===
Following their 1997 season, the Hurricanes failed to qualify for the semi-finals until 2003. Despite this, they were still known for the attacking nature of their backline that included the All Blacks stars Tana Umaga and Christian Cullen. The team played with flair and could score at any moment, whatever their position on the field, giving rise to the teams catch cry of &#x27;expect the unexpected&#x27;. However the team struggled for consistent performances and at crunch time in matches, leading to patchy form and results.

After the 1999 World Cup, Jonah Lomu&#x27;s contract with the NZRU expired he was linked to many clubs around the world, in rugby league as well as union and also the NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys. On 23 November 1999 it was announced that the winger had re-signed with the NZRU and agreed terms with the Wellington Rugby Union, despite a reported £1.1 million offer by Bristol. The move to the Wellington union meant he could be included in the protected group of players for the Hurricanes.

The Hurricanes also opened 2000 with a new stadium. The highlights of that year included the victory over eventual champions the Crusaders, 41–29, in front of a packed house. At the end of the season the &#x27;Canes still had a mathematical chance of making the semis and only had to beat the Bulls to stay in contention. However, the Hurricanes played one of their worst games of the year, losing the match to one of the worst performing teams at that point in the competition&#x27;s history and lost the possibility of qualifying for the semi-finals. The team finished eighth on the table.

Despite the Wellington Lions (whom most of the Hurricanes squad were chosen from) winning the 2000 NPC, the Hurricanes finished ninth in the final standings in 2001; one worse than the year before. Another ninth placing in 2002 resulted in Graham Mourie, who had led the team since 2000, resigning.

===New era: since 2003===
In spite of reports that Colin Cooper, the then Crusaders assistant-coach, had said he was &quot;not yet ready to jump ship&quot; and wanted to stay with the South Island franchise, the Hurricanes were able to lure him away from the champions and made him their head coach for the 2003 season.

Cooper, along with newly appointed captain Tana Umaga, helped to mould the inconsistent and ill-disciplined Hurricanes into one of the top teams in the competition. 2003 was the beginning of a new era for the Hurricanes as they reached the semi-finals for just the second time in their history on the back of a strong seven-game winning streak mid-season. Their success came partly with the break-out year for mid-fielder Ma&#x27;a Nonu, his strong performances and partnership with captain Tana Umaga pushed out former All Black Pita Alatini and saw him score six tries en route to the All Black squad. The team also benefited from the steady hand of David Holwell at first five-eighth and an improving and mobile forward pack.
Hurricanes stalwart Christian Cullen would leave New Zealand shores for Irish club Munster after his omission from the All Blacks 2003 World Cup squad, despite scoring eight tries during the season.

All Black great Jonah Lomu was left out of the 2004 squad, due to a life-threatening illness that would eventually result in a kidney transplant. He would never again play for the Hurricanes.

The majority of the team was retained&lt; for 2005. including new centre Conrad Smith. The Hurricanes came back in 2005 to the form that saw them make the playoffs two years prior. Former New Zealand Colt Flyhalf Jimmy Gopperth was the real &quot;find&quot; of the season, scoring 139 points, which helped offset the departure of David Holwell to Ireland. The Hurricanes had tried to sign Australian playmaker Brock James, who had starred the previous NPC season for Taranaki and the Blues, and young star Luke McAlister indicated that he would like to play in Wellington. With both Daniel Carter and Aaron Mauger at the Crusaders capable of playing first five-eighth the team also made an attempt to lure Andrew Mehrtens to Wellington, without success.

In 2006 two new teams entered the competition, the Bloemfontein-based Cheetahs from South Africa and the Perth-based Western Force from Australia, creating the Super 14. Rodney So&#x27;oialo was appointed captain of the Hurricanes to succeed former All Black captain Tana Umaga. The team won all but four matches. They made their first Super Rugby final but lost to the Crusaders in a match played under thick fog. Following the match there was an incident in a nightclub involving Chris Masoe and Tana Umaga. The club finances benefitted from on-pitch success, with NZ$1.36 million profit on its 2006 turnover of NZ$7.44 million.

The Hurricanes returned to the semi-finals in both 2008 and 2009, however were unable to capture the same success in subsequent seasons. 2011 saw the arrival of Mark Hammett as coach and the departure of Andrew Hore, Ma&#x27;a Nonu and Piri Weepu.

The Hurricanes finished 11th in the 2013 Super Rugby season.

2015 saw the Hurricanes finish first in the regular season, topping the table with 66 points and a win–loss record of 14–2 in round robin play. The Hurricanes picked up the New Zealand Conference trophy after beating the Highlanders. After beating the Brumbies in the semi-final, the Hurricanes lost the final against the Highlanders 21–14. It was the final Super Rugby match for Conrad Smith, Ma&#x27;a Nonu and Jeremy Thrush – all Hurricanes that have played over 100 caps.

On 8 December 2015, Rugby World Cup-winning hooker Dane Coles was named captain for the 2016 season. Rugby World Cup-winning halfback TJ Perenara was named as vice-captain.

2016 was a big year for the Hurricanes finishing first overall on the points table, despite sitting in 7th going into the final round of the regular season. This saw them go into the quarter-finals against the Sharks winning 41-0 at Wellington Regional Stadium. They carried on to the semi-finals playing the Chiefs and winning 25-9 at Wellington Regional Stadium. The Hurricanes played the Lions in the final, winning the game 20-3 at Wellington Regional Stadium. This was the first time in Super Rugby history that the Hurricanes won the title. It was Victor Vito&#x27;s final and 100th game for the Hurricanes.

The Hurricanes looked to win another championship title in 2017, taking out 12 of 15 games and making it to the quarter-finals against the Brumbies, which the Hurricanes won 16-35. However, in the semi-finals they were defeated by the Lions, who they defeated in the 2016 final.

In 2018, the Hurricanes won 11 of 16 round robin matches, which put them into the quarter-finals against a very tough Chiefs side. The Hurricanes narrowly defeated the Chiefs 32-31. But once again, the Hurricanes failed to make it past the semi-finals, losing to the Crusaders 30-12.

2019 saw the Hurricanes win 12, draw 1 and lose 3. This result took them to the quarter-finals and they faced the Bulls, which was tight but the Hurricanes won 35-28. Unfortunately, the Hurricanes lost to the Crusaders again in a tight battle in Christchurch (30-26).

After 7 rounds of 2020, the Hurricanes finished 3rd in the NZ conference and 6th overall. The competition was suspended after 7 rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a domestic Super Rugby competition was formed in New Zealand called Super Rugby Aotearoa, which kicked off in June 2020. The Hurricanes finished 3rd overall, winning 5 and losing 3. A notable moment from the Hurricanes in Super Rugby Aotearoa 2020 was that they ended the Crusaders&#x27; 18 match home winning streak, defeating them 32-34 in Round 7.

Super Rugby Aotearoa 2021 hasn&#x27;t been so fortunate to the Hurricanes. They have only won one match, which was a 30-19 victory over the Highlanders in Dunedin.

===Grounds===
The Hurricanes play the majority of their home matches at the 34,500 capacity Sky Stadium (formerly named Westpac Stadium) on Wellington&#x27;s waterfront. The stadium is affectionately known as &quot;The Cake-Tin&quot; due to its distinctive shape. It was opened in 2000 to replace Athletic Park, where the team had been previously based.

Central Energy Trust Arena in Palmerston North and McLean Park in Napier have also played host to Hurricanes home matches. In the initial years of the competition, the Hurricanes played once or occasionally twice, away from their Wellington base depending on whether they had five or six home games per year. However, in recent years, the team has seldom ventured from Sky Stadium, playing at-most one match per year in Palmerston North or Napier.

===Region===
The team represents the Poverty Bay, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Wanganui, Manawatu, Wairarapa-Bush, Horowhenua-Kapiti and Wellington unions. In 2013, Taranaki severed its ties with the club, signing its allegiance to the in the hope of attracting Chiefs home matches to New Plymouth. On 7 February 2025, the announced that also East Coast had changed its provincial affiliation from the Hurricanes to the Chiefs.

==Ownership and Finances==
In 2012, it was announced that a new company, Hurricanes Investment Ltd Partnership, had purchased a licence from the NZRU to operate the club.

While the NZRU retains ownership of the team, as well as control of the contracts of the players and head coach, the licensee is responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations. Hurricanes Investment Ltd Partnership is a joint venture between the Wellington Rugby Football Union owning 50 per cent of shares with the remaining 50 per cent held by a consortium of private investors, led by noted economist and author Gareth Morgan. In July 2013, it was announced that the Horowhenua-Kapiti Rugby Football Union had purchased a 3 per cent stake in the company Hurricanes&#x27; Investment Ltd Partnership, with $100,000 contributed towards the company.

==Development team==
The Hurricanes have fielded a development team in competitions such as the Pacific Rugby Cup and in matches against other representative teams for several seasons. Known as the Hurricanes Hunters or Hurricanes Development XV, the squad is selected from the best emerging rugby talent in the Hurricanes catchment area and is composed of Hurricanes contracted players, wider training group members, under 20s, and selected club players.

<text>Como Lake is a lake up to deep in St. Paul, Minnesota, United States. It, along with the neighboring Como Park, has been a recreation area for residents of the Twin Cities for more than a century. It was named in 1848 by local farmer Charles Perry. A pavilion sits on the west side of the lake, and plays host to theatrical performances and concerts during the warmer months. The park features a variety of attractions, including the Como Park Zoo and Conservatory and the Como Regional Park Pool.

==Environmental history==
Como Lake was originally mostly a wetland with some open water but was expanded and deepened when the surrounding Como Park was developed. The lake is fed by storm sewer water run off. In the summer algae blooms were frequent and visitors complained about the smell of the lake. Attempts to improve the lake quality have been made which include replacing invasive plants with native plants, installation of other water filtration methods, application of herbicides, and alum treatments. These changes have reduced algae growth and improved the quality of the lake water as of 2022.

==Human history==
After James-Younger Gang member Charlie Pitts was killed in the chaotic aftermath of the disastrous September 7, 1876 Northfield, Minnesota raid, his body was boxed up and temporarily submerged in the lake by Dr. Henry Hoyt, a local physician who wanted the bleached skeleton as a display piece for his office. The skeleton was on display for unknown number of years at the Stage Coach Museum in Shakopee, Minnesota. In 1981 the remains were donated to the Northfield Historical Society. Currently the skeleton is housed in the Physical Anthropology Lab at Minnesota State University in Mankato awaiting analysis.

==Fish==
The lake contains black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, northern pike, pumpkinseed, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the lake&#x27;s bluegill, bullhead, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye due to mercury and/or PFOS contamination.

<text>The Sicels ( ; or &quot;Siculī&quot;) were an Indo-European tribe who inhabited eastern Sicily, their namesake, during the Iron Age. They spoke the Siculian language. After the defeat of the Sicels at the Battle of Nomae in 450 BC and the death of Sicel leader Ducetius in 440 BC, the Sicel state broke down and the Sicel culture merged into Magna Graecia.

==History==

Archaeological excavation has shown some Mycenean influence on Bronze Age Sicily. The earliest literary mention of Sicels is in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Homer also mentions Sicania, but makes no distinctions: &quot;they were (from) a faraway place and a faraway people and apparently they were one and the same&quot; for Homer, Robin Lane Fox notes. 

It is possible that the Sicels and the Sicani of the Iron Age had consisted of an Illyrian population who (as with the Messapians) had imposed themselves on a native, Pre-Indo-European (&quot;Mediterranean&quot;) population. Thucydides and other classical writers were aware of the traditions according to which the Sicels had once lived in Central Italy, east and even north of Rome. Thence they were dislodged by Umbrian and Sabine tribes, and finally crossed into Sicily. Their social organization appears to have been tribal, economically and agriculturally. According to Diodorus Siculus, after a series of conflicts with the Sicani, the river Salso was declared the boundary between their respective territories.

The common assumption is that the Sicels were more recent arrivals, had introduced the use of iron into Bronze Age Sicily and brought the domesticated horse. That would date their arrival on the island to the early 1st millennium BC. However, there is some evidence that the ethnonym may predate the Iron Age, based on the name &quot;Shekelesh&quot; given to one of the Sea Peoples in the Great Karnak Inscription in the 5th year of Merneptah&#x27;s reign ( 1207 BC). The name &quot;Shekelesh&quot; is also cited in a wall relief at Medinet Habu (Ramses III mortuary temple), with picture and writings describing the second invasion within a 30 years&#x27; period by the &quot;sea peoples&quot; in the 8th year of Ramses III&#x27;s reign (1177 BC or 1186 BC, historians differ between these two dates). Eric Cline closely relates these two attacks on Egypt to the beginning of the Late Bronze Age collapse. Archaeological evidence points towards the Sicels&#x27; arrival on the island between the thirteenth and eleventh century BC.

The Sicel necropolis of Pantalica, near Syracuse, is the best known, and the second-largest one is the Necropolis of Cassibile, near Noto. Their elite tombs &quot;a forno&quot;, or oven-shaped, take the form of beehives.

The chief Sicel towns were Agyrium (Agira); Centuripa or Centuripae (Centorbi but now once again called Centuripe); Henna (later Castrogiovanni, which is a corruption of &quot;Castrum Hennae&quot; through the Arabic &quot;Qasr-janni&quot; but, since the 1920s, once again called Enna); and three sites named Hybla: Hybla Major, called Geleatis or Gereatis, on the river Symaethus; Hybla Minor, on the east coast north of Syracuse (possibly pre-dating the Dorian colony of Hyblaean Megara); and Hybla Heraea in the south of Sicily.

With the coming of Greek colonists—both Chalcidians, who maintained good relations with the Sicels, and Dorians, who did not—and the growing influence of Greek civilization, the Sicels were forced out of most of the advantageous port sites and withdrew by degrees into the hinterland. Sixty kilometres (forty miles) from the coast of the Ionian Sea, Sicels and Greeks exceptionally lived side by side in Morgantina to the extent that historians argue whether it was a Greek &quot;polis&quot; or a Sicel city. Greek goods, especially pottery, moved along natural routes, and eventually Hellenistic influences can be observed in regularised Sicel town planning. However, in the middle of the fifth century BC a Sicel leader, Ducetius, was able to create an organised Sicel state as a unitary domain in opposition to Greek Syracusa, including several cities in the central and south of the island. After a few years of independence, in 450 BC, his army was defeated by the Greeks in the Battle of Nomae and he died ten years later. Without his charisma, the movement collapsed and the increasingly Hellenized culture of the Sicels lost its distinctive character. But in the winter of 426/5 Thucydides noted the presence among the allies of Athens in the siege of Syracuse of Sicels who had &quot;previously been allies of Syracuse, but had been harshly governed by the Syracusans and had now revolted&quot;. (Thucydides 3.103.1) Aside from Thucydides, the Greek literary sources on Sicels and other pre-Hellenic peoples of Sicily are to be found in fragmentary scattered quotes from the lost material of Hellanicus of Lesbos and Antiochus of Syracuse.

There is some evidence that the Sicels had several matriarchal customs, which is unattested in other Indo-European groups of the region.

==Language==

Linguistic studies have suggested that the Sicels may have spoken an Indo-European language and occupied eastern Sicily as well as southernmost Italy whereas the Elymi (Greek &quot;Elymoi&quot;) and Sicani (Greek: &quot;Sikanoi&quot;) inhabited western and central Sicily, respectively. It is likely that the Sicani spoke a non-Indo-European language, the classification of their language remains uncertain. Conversely, the Elymian language is generally accepted to have been an Indo-European language, though its exact classification within the family is unclear. Some consider it related to Ligurian, while others to the Italic languages. 

Of the Sicel language the little that is known is derived from glosses of ancient writers and from a very few inscriptions, not all of which are demonstrably Sicel. It is thought that the Sicels did not employ writing until they were influenced by the Greek colonists. Several Sicel inscriptions have been found to date: Mendolito (Adrano), Centuripe, Poira, Paternò‑Civita, Paliké (Rocchicella di Mineo), Montagna di Ramacca, Licodia Eubea, Ragusa Ibla, Sciri Sottano, Monte Casasia, Castiglione di Ragusa, Terravecchia di Grammichele, Morgantina, Montagna di Marzo (Piazza Armerina), and Terravecchia di Cuti. The first inscription discovered, of ninety-nine Greek letters, was found on a spouted jug found in 1824 at Centuripe; it uses a Greek alphabet of the 6th or 5th century BC. It reads:

:&quot;nunustentimimarustainamiemitomestiduromnanepos duromiemtomestiveliomnedemponitantomeredesuino brtome…&quot;

There have been various attempts at interpreting it (e.g. V. Pisani 1963, G. Radke 1996) with no sure results. Another long Sicel inscription was found in Montagna di Marzo:

:&quot;tamuraabesakedqoiaveseurumakesagepipokedlutimbe levopomanatesemaidarnakeibureitamomiaetiurela&quot;

The best evidence for Sicel having been of Indo-European derivation is the verb form &quot;pibe&quot; &quot;drink&quot;, a second-person singular present imperative active exactly cognate with Latin &quot;bibe&quot; (and Sanskrit &quot;piba&quot;, etc.). Membership in the Italic branch, perhaps even close to Latino-Faliscan, cannot be ruled out: Varro states that Sicel was strictly allied to Latin as many words sounded almost identical and had the same meaning, such as &quot;oncia&quot;, &quot;lytra&quot;, &quot;moeton&quot; (Lat. &quot;mutuum&quot;).

==Religion==
Their characteristic cult of the Palici is influenced by Greek myth in the version that has survived, in which the local nymph Talia bore to Adranus, the volcanic god whom the Greeks identified with Hephaestus, twin sons, who were &quot;twice-born&quot; (&quot;palin&quot; &quot;again&quot;; &quot;ikein&quot; &quot;to come&quot;), born first of their nymph mother, and then of the earth, because of the &quot;jealousy&quot; of Hera, who urged Mother Earth, Gaia, to swallow up the nymph. Then the soil parted, giving birth to the twins, who were venerated in Sicily as patrons of navigation and of agriculture. In the most archaic level of Greek mythology, a titan, Tityos, grew so large that he split his mother&#x27;s womb and had to be carried to term by Gaia herself. He came to the attention of later Greek mythographers only when he attempted to waylay Leto near Delphi. If such a mytheme is set into action as ritual, it is usual to see a pair of sacrificial children laid in the earth to encourage the green growth. 

In the temple to Adranus, father of the Palici, the Sicels kept an eternal fire. A god Hybla (or goddess Hyblaea), after whom three towns were named, had a sanctuary at Hybla Gereatis. The connection of Demeter and Kore with Henna (the rape of Proserpine) and of the nymph Arethusa with Syracuse is due to Greek influence.

<doc id="647353" wikidata="Q139437" url="?curid=647353" title="Saint-Lambert, Montérégie">
<text>Saint-Lambert (, ) is a city () in southwestern Quebec, Canada, located on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, opposite Montreal. It is part of the Urban agglomeration of Longueuil of the Montérégie administrative region.

Saint-Lambert is divided into two main sections: the original city of Saint-Lambert and the Préville neighbourhood. The original city of Saint-Lambert (as it existed prior to 1969) is located from the Country Club of Montreal golf course to the border of the Le Vieux-Longueuil borough. It includes the city&#x27;s downtown, known as &quot;The Village&quot;. On the other side of the Country Club of Montreal is the former city of Préville, which merged with Saint-Lambert in 1969. It extends to the borders of the city of Brossard and the Longueuil borough of Greenfield Park.

Saint-Lambert was named for the early French Canadian hunter Lambert Closse.

==History==

In 1636, Louis XIII of France was dividing up seigneuries in the new colony of New France. One of these was known as La Prairie, comprising La Prairie de la Magdeleine and La Prairie de Saint-Lambert. The lower part of the latter, was known as Mouillepied, due to the swampy conditions of the area. Saint-Lambert&#x27;s first two permanent residents were André Marsil and André Achim in the 18th century. Today André Marsil&#x27;s house can be found on the corner of Riverside Drive and Notre-Dame Avenue, was converted into a textile museum called the Marsil Museum (), although the museum has since moved to the Bonsecours Market.

In 1722, Mouillepied was transferred from La Prairie seigneurie to Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil parish.

Following the establishment of the railway in 1852 and the completion of the Victoria Bridge in 1859, the village received a permanent link to the island of Montreal. The Victoria Bridge is the oldest bridge linking Montreal to the South Shore, and carried the first rail line linking Quebec&#x27;s largest city to New York City. Because of this, Saint-Lambert became an important passenger and freight stop for a long period of time. This is evident in the city&#x27;s architecture, in which many old industrial buildings are found near the railway tracks. Many of these have since been converted into lofts such as the former Waterman pens factory, originally built in 1908. 

With the bridge and railway came a quick growth in Saint-Lambert&#x27;s population and the construction of new housing. Saint-Lambert detached itself from Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil and achieved municipality status in 1857, under its first mayor, Louis Bétournay. At the time, Saint-Lambert did not include Mouillepied, which instead had remained in Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil.

In 1892, Saint-Lambert reached village status, attained town status in 1898 and city status in 1921.

During World War I and World War II, Saint-Lambert had one of the highest military enlistment rates in Canada. The small city lost a total of 132 soldiers in both wars. This number was a significant portion of the young people at the time.

In the 1950s, the development of Saint-Lambert was enhanced with the building of the St. Lambert Locks in the St. Lawrence Seaway, to bypass the smaller Lachine Canal, and this became the most easterly lock in the Seaway. Suburban growth from Montreal in this period also affected Saint-Lambert, as well as many of the older communities on the South Shore.

Since its establishment, the city&#x27;s limits have barely changed. In 1948, the old Mouillepied area of the town of Jacques-Cartier was split off and erected into the town of Préville. It merged with Saint-Lambert in 1969.

Saint-Lambert had an anglophone majority population starting in 1881, and throughout most of the 20th century. Saint-Lambert had 12,460 anglophones and was 61% anglophone as recently as the 1981 census. This started to change, as it increasingly become the home to upper class francophone families, in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.

The late 1990s saw the construction of a new residential neighbourhood in Saint-Lambert, known as &quot;Le Haut Saint-Lambert&quot;. It was built on the remaining vacant land in city limits near LeMoyne.

In 2007, the city of Saint-Lambert celebrated its 150th anniversary.

;Amalgamation and de-amalgamation
On January 1, 2002, municipal reorganization merged Saint-Lambert with LeMoyne to form a borough in the new Longueuil mega-city. There was a strong &quot;de-merger&quot; movement and a referendum was won on June 20, 2004, to re-establish the former city. The city was officially reborn (excluding LeMoyne, which remained with Longueuil) on January 1, 2006, while on January 7, 2006, the Saint-Lambert flag was hoisted in front of city hall and the mayor, councillors and city manager took their oath of office.

==Geography==

Saint-Lambert is underlain by Ordovician period black shale. This bedrock is covered by deep clay drift over most of the town. Soils were poorly drained in their natural state; as such, they were classified as gleysols—strongly acidic (Longueuil series) under most of the town and neutral to mildly alkaline (Boucherville series) in part of the western section (Préville). Drainage and excavation have been used to adapt the soil for housing construction.

The most common trees in Saint-Lambert are those species which tolerate poor drainage. These include poplars, willows, red maple, silver maple and green ash. The American elm was formerly abundant but its population has been severely reduced by Dutch elm disease. Non-native species are commonly represented by Norway maple, silver birch, English oak, blue spruce, common horsechestnut and honey locust. Rare exotics which benefit from St-Lambert&#x27;s favorable microclimate include Japanese maple and tulip tree. Most trees in Saint-Lambert show some evidence of damage from an ice storm in January 1998 and a severe thunderstorm in June 2008.

===Climate===
The climate of Saint-Lambert is characterized by abundant precipitation and one of the longest, warmest growing seasons in Quebec. As in other parts of Greater Montreal, lengthy spells of hot humid weather are common in summer, and thunderstorms frequently occur. Heavy snow is usual in winter and several damaging ice storms have occurred over the town&#x27;s history.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Saint-Lambert had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As of the 2006 Census, the median income for a household in the city was $61,583, and the median income for a family was $89,786. The median income for the city was $36,293. About 11.9% of the population were low income, including 9.0% of those under age 18. The average value of an owned dwelling was $311,329.

In terms of ethnic origin, 50.6% identified as Canadian, 39.6% French, 9.7% Irish, 7.8% English, 6.4% Scottish, 4.1% Italian, 3.7% German, 2.4% First Nations, 1.7% Belgian, 1.7% Spanish, and 1.6% Chinese.

According to the 2001 census, there were 15,690 Roman Catholics in Saint-Lambert, who accounted for seventy-six percent of the population. Additionally, there were 1,970 Protestants in Saint-Lambert in 2001, accounting for 9.5% of all residents. The number of non-Christians in Saint-Lambert amounts to less than five percent of the population, and 9.6% of the population observe no religion whatsoever.

==Economy==

Most of Saint-Lambert&#x27;s commercial activity is based on Victoria Avenue, particularly on the part of the strip in the city&#x27;s downtown (between Riverside Drive and the CN tracks), known as &quot;the Village&quot;. This part of Victoria is most notably the location to the flagship of Taylor&#x27;s department store. On this part of Victoria alone, there are around 44 businesses that sell durable and semi-durable goods; 22 cafés, bistros and restaurants and 960 street parking spaces. Around 50% of customers in the area come by automobile and 40% come by foot.

Saint-Lambert is also home to Groupe Serdy, the owner of cable television specialty channels Évasion and Zeste. Roctest, a firm that specializes in making instrumentation for civil engineering projects also has its head office and factory in Saint-Lambert.

<text>The Most Dangerous Game is a first person narrative novel by English author Gavin Lyall, first published in 1964. The plot of the novel is unrelated to the Richard Connell short story &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;.

== Plot ==
Bill Cary is a bush pilot living in Lapland in northern Finland, making a precarious living flying aerial survey flights looking for nickel deposits, and occasional charter cargo flights of dubious legitimacy in his beat-up old de Havilland Beaver. Towards the end of the flying season, a wealthy American hunter hires him to fly into a prohibited part of Finland near the Soviet border in order to hunt bear. Subsequently, he is assaulted by thugs when he refuses a charter contract to search for a lost Tsarist treasure, comes under suspicion from the Finnish police for smuggling when Tsarist-era gold sovereigns start turning up, and from the Finnish secret police for espionage. However, things get more serious when the wealthy American hunter&#x27;s beautiful sister turns up to search for her brother, and his fellow bush pilots start getting killed off in a series of suspicious accidents. Cary suspects that the events he is increasingly involved in may stem from an incident in his wartime past.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
&quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; was a runner-up for the British Crime Writers Association Gold Dagger Award in 1964.

<text>Peripatric speciation is a mode of speciation in which a new species is formed from an isolated peripheral population. Since peripatric speciation resembles allopatric speciation, in that populations are isolated and prevented from exchanging genes, it can often be difficult to distinguish between them, and peripatric speciation may be considered one type or model of allopatric speciation. The primary distinguishing characteristic of peripatric speciation is that one of the populations is much smaller than the other, as opposed to (other types of) allopatric speciation, in which similarly-sized populations become separated. The terms peripatric and peripatry are often used in biogeography, referring to organisms whose ranges are closely adjacent but do not overlap, being separated where these organisms do not occur—for example on an oceanic island compared to the mainland. Such organisms are usually closely related (&quot;e.g.&quot; sister species); their distribution being the result of peripatric speciation.

The concept of peripatric speciation was first outlined by the evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr in 1954. Since then, other alternative models have been developed such as centrifugal speciation, that posits that a species&#x27; population experiences periods of geographic range expansion followed by shrinking periods, leaving behind small isolated populations on the periphery of the main population. Other models have involved the effects of sexual selection on limited population sizes. Other related models of peripherally isolated populations based on chromosomal rearrangements have been developed such as budding speciation and quantum speciation.

The existence of peripatric speciation is supported by observational evidence and laboratory experiments. Scientists observing the patterns of a species biogeographic distribution and its phylogenetic relationships are able to reconstruct the historical process by which they diverged. Further, oceanic islands are often the subject of peripatric speciation research due to their isolated habitats—with the Hawaiian Islands widely represented in much of the scientific literature.

== History ==

Peripatric speciation was originally proposed by Ernst Mayr in 1954, and fully theoretically modeled in 1982. It is related to the founder effect, where small living populations may undergo selection bottlenecks. The founder effect is based on models that suggest peripatric speciation can occur by the interaction of selection and genetic drift, which may play a significant role. Mayr first conceived of the idea by his observations of kingfisher populations in New Guinea and its surrounding islands. &quot;Tanysiptera galatea&quot; was largely uniform in morphology on the mainland, but the populations on the surrounding islands differed significantly—referring to this pattern as &quot;peripatric&quot;. This same pattern was observed by many of Mayr&#x27;s contemporaries at the time such as by E. B. Ford&#x27;s studies of &quot;Maniola jurtina&quot;. Around the same time, the botanist Verne Grant developed a model of quantum speciation very similar to Mayr&#x27;s model in the context of plants.

In what has been called Mayr&#x27;s genetic revolutions, he postulated that genetic drift played the primary role that resulted in this pattern. Seeing that a species cohesion is maintained by conservative forces such as epistasis and the slow pace of the spread of favorable alleles in a large population (based heavily on J. B. S. Haldane&#x27;s calculations), he reasoned that speciation could only take place in which a population bottleneck occurred. A small, isolated, founder population could be established on an island for example. Containing less genetic variation from the main population, shifts in allele frequencies may occur from different selection pressures. This to further changes in the network of linked loci, driving a cascade of genetic change, or a &quot;genetic revolution&quot;—a large-scale reorganization of the entire genome of the peripheral population. Mayr did recognize that the chances of success were incredibly low and that extinction was likely; though noting that some examples of successful founder populations existed at the time.

Shortly after Mayr, William Louis Brown, Jr. proposed an alternative model of peripatric speciation in 1957 called centrifugal speciation. In 1976 and 1980, the Kaneshiro model of peripatric speciation was developed by Kenneth Y. Kaneshiro which focused on sexual selection as a driver for speciation during population bottlenecks.

== Models ==
=== Peripatric ===
Peripatric speciation models are identical to models of vicariance (allopatric speciation). Requiring both geographic separation and time, speciation can result as a predictable byproduct. Peripatry can be distinguished from allopatric speciation by three key features:
*The size of the isolated population
*Strong selection caused by the dispersal and colonization of novel environments, 
*The effects of genetic drift on small populations.

The size of a population is important because individuals colonizing a new habitat likely contain only a small sample of the genetic variation of the original population. This promotes divergence due to strong selective pressures, leading to the rapid fixation of an allele within the descendant population. This gives rise to the potential for genetic incompatibilities to evolve. These incompatibilities cause reproductive isolation, giving rise to—sometimes rapid—speciation events. Furthermore, two important predictions are invoked, namely that geological or climatic changes cause populations to become locally fragmented (or regionally when considering allopatric speciation), and that an isolated population&#x27;s reproductive traits evolve enough as to prevent interbreeding upon potential secondary contact.

The peripatric model results in, what have been called, progenitor-derivative species pairs, whereby the derivative species (the peripherally isolated population)—geographically and genetically isolated from the progenitor species—diverges. A specific phylogenetic signature results from this mode of speciation: the geographically widespread progenitor species becomes paraphyletic (thereby becoming a paraspecies), with respect to the derivative species (the peripheral isolate). The concept of a paraspecies is therefore a logical consequence of the evolutionary species concept, by which one species gives rise to a daughter species. It is thought that the character traits of the peripherally isolated species become apomorphic, while the central population remains plesiomorphic.

Modern cladistic methods have developed definitions that have incidentally removed derivative species by defining clades in a way that assumes that when a speciation event occurs, the original species no longer exists, while two new species arise; this is not the case in peripatric speciation. Mayr warned against this, as it causes a species to lose their classification status. Loren H. Rieseberg and Luc Brouillet recognized the same dilemma in plant classification.

=== Quantum and budding speciation ===
The botanist Verne Grant proposed the term quantum speciation that combined the ideas of J. T. Gulick (his observation of the variation of species in semi-isolation), Sewall Wright (his models of genetic drift), Mayr (both his peripatric and genetic revolution models), and George Gaylord Simpson (his development of the idea of quantum evolution). Quantum speciation is a rapid process with large genotypic or phenotypic effects, whereby a new, cross-fertilizing plant species buds off from a larger population as a semi-isolated peripheral population. Interbreeding and genetic drift takes place due to the reduced population size, driving changes to the genome that would most likely result in extinction (due to low adaptive value). In rare instances, chromosomal traits with adaptive value may arise, resulting in the origin of a new, derivative species. Evidence for the occurrence of this type of speciation has been found in several plant species pairs: &quot;Layia discoidea&quot; and &quot;L. glandulosa&quot;, &quot;Clarkia lingulata&quot; and &quot;C. biloba&quot;, and &quot;Stephanomeria malheurensis&quot; and &quot;S. exigua&quot; ssp. &quot;coronaria&quot;.

A closely related model of peripatric speciation is called budding speciation—largely applied in the context of plant speciation. The budding process, where a new species originates at the margins of an ancestral range, is thought to be common in plants—especially in progenitor-derivative species pairs.

=== Centrifugal speciation ===
William Louis Brown, Jr. proposed an alternative model of peripatric speciation in 1957 called centrifugal speciation. This model contrasts with peripatric speciation by virtue of the origin of the genetic novelty that leads to reproductive isolation. A population of a species experiences periods of geographic range expansion followed by periods of contraction. During the contraction phase, fragments of the population become isolated as small refugial populations on the periphery of the central population. Because of the large size and potentially greater genetic variation within the central population, mutations arise more readily. These mutations are left in the isolated peripheral populations, promoting reproductive isolation. Consequently, Brown suggested that during another expansion phase, the central population would overwhelm the peripheral populations, hindering speciation. However, if the species finds a specialized ecological niche, the two may coexist. The phylogenetic signature of this model is that the central population becomes derived, while the peripheral isolates stay plesiomorphic—the reverse of the general model. In contrast to centrifugal speciation, peripatric speciation has sometimes been referred to as centripetal speciation (see figures 1 and 2 for a contrast). Centrifugal speciation has been largely ignored in the scientific literature, often dominated by the traditional model of peripatric speciation. Despite this, Brown cited a wealth of evidence to support his model, of which has not yet been refuted.

&quot;Peromyscus polionotus&quot; and &quot;P. melanotis&quot; (the peripherally isolated species from the central population of &quot;P. maniculatus&quot;) arose via the centrifugal speciation model. Centrifugal speciation may have taken place in tree kangaroos, South American frogs (&quot;Ceratophrys&quot;), shrews (&quot;Crocidura&quot;), and primates (&quot;Presbytis melalophos&quot;). John C. Briggs associates centrifugal speciation with centers of origin, contending that the centrifugal model is better supported by the data, citing species patterns from the proposed &#x27;center of origin&#x27; within the Indo-West Pacific

=== Kaneshiro model ===
The Kaneshiro Model also provides an explanation of the mechanism of speciation during founder events as proposed by Ernst Mayr and Hampton Carson. In most cases, founder events result when single fertilized female is accidentally translocated to an entirely different location, e.g., an adjacent island among a chain of islands such as the Hawaiian Archipelago, and produces a few offspring. Such a founder colony is faced with extremely small population size which as described by the Kaneshiro Model, experiences a shift in the mating system towards and increase in frequency of less choosy females. The resulting destabilization of the genetic system provides the milieu for new genetic variants to arise providing the recipe for speciation to occur. Eventually, a growth in population size paired with novel female mate preferences will give rise to reproductive isolation from the main population-thereby completing the speciation process. Support for this model comes from experiments and observation of species that exhibit asymmetric mating patterns such as the Hawaiian &quot;Drosophila&quot; species or the Hawaiian cricket &quot;Laupala&quot;. However, while laboratory experiments are ongoing and yet to be completed in support of the model, there are field observations of shifts in the mating systems that undergo population bottlenecks which demonstrate that the dynamics of sexual selection is occurring in nature and therefore, it does represent a plausible process of peripatric speciation that takes place in nature.

== Evidence ==

Observational evidence and laboratory experiments support the occurrence of peripatric speciation. Islands and archipelagos are often the subject of speciation studies in that they represent isolated populations of organisms. Island species provide direct evidence of speciation occurring peripatrically in such that, &quot;the presence of endemic species on oceanic islands whose closest relatives inhabit a nearby continent&quot; must have originated by a colonization event. Comparative phylogeography of oceanic archipelagos shows consistent patterns of sequential colonization and speciation along island chains, most notably on the Azores islands, Canary Islands, Society Islands, Marquesas Islands, Galápagos Islands, Austral Islands, and the Hawaiian Islands—all of which express geological patterns of spatial isolation and, in some cases, linear arrangement. Peripatric speciation also occurs on continents, as isolation of small populations can occur through various geographic and dispersion events. Laboratory studies have been conducted where populations of &quot;Drosophila&quot;, for example, are separated from one another and evolve in reproductive isolation.

=== Hawaiian archipelago ===

&quot;Drosophila&quot; species on the Hawaiian archipelago have helped researchers understand speciation processes in great detail. It is well established that &quot;Drosophila&quot; has undergone an adaptive radiation into hundreds of endemic species on the Hawaiian island chain; originating from a single common ancestor (supported from molecular analysis). Studies consistently find that colonization of each island occurred from older to younger islands, and in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, speciating peripatrically at least fifty percent of the time. In conjunction with &quot;Drosophila&quot;, Hawaiian lobeliads (&quot;Cyanea&quot;) have also undergone an adaptive radiation, with upwards of twenty-seven percent of extant species arising after new island colonization—exemplifying peripatric speciation—once again, occurring in the old-to-young island direction.

Other endemic species in Hawaii also provide evidence of peripatric speciation such as the endemic flightless crickets (&quot;Laupala&quot;). It has been estimated that, &quot;17 species out of 36 well-studied cases of [&quot;Laupala&quot;] speciation were peripatric&quot;. Plant species in genera&#x27;s such as &quot;Dubautia&quot;, &quot;Wilkesia&quot;, and &quot;Argyroxiphium&quot; have also radiated along the archipelago. Other animals besides insects show this same pattern such as the Hawaiian amber snail (&quot;Succinea caduca&quot;), and ‘Elepaio flycatchers.

&quot;Tetragnatha&quot; spiders have also speciated peripatrically on the Hawaiian islands, Numerous arthropods have been documented existing in patterns consistent with the geologic evolution of the island chain, in such that, phylogenetic reconstructions find younger species inhabiting the geologically younger islands and older species inhabiting the older islands (or in some cases, ancestors date back to when islands currently below sea level were exposed). Spiders such as those from the genus &quot;Orsonwelles&quot; exhibit patterns compatible with the old-to-young geology. Other endemic genera such as &quot;Argyrodes&quot; have been shown to have speciated along the island chain. &quot;Pagiopalus&quot;, &quot;Pedinopistha&quot;, and part of the family Thomisidae have adaptively radiated along the island chain, as well as the wolf spider family, Lycosidae.

A host of other Hawaiian endemic arthropod species and genera have had their speciation and phylogeographical patterns studied: the &quot;Drosophila grimshawi&quot; species complex, damselflies (&quot;Megalagrion xanthomelas&quot; and &quot;Megalagrion pacificum&quot;), &quot;Doryonychus raptor&quot;, &quot;Littorophiloscia hawaiiensis&quot;, &quot;Anax strenuus&quot;, &quot;Nesogonia blackburni&quot;, &quot;Theridion grallator&quot;, &quot;Vanessa tameamea&quot;, &quot;Hyalopeplus pellucidus&quot;, &quot;Coleotichus blackburniae&quot;, &quot;Labula&quot;, &quot;Hawaiioscia&quot;, &quot;Banza&quot; (in the family Tettigoniidae), &quot;Caconemobius&quot;, &quot;Eupethicea&quot;, &quot;Ptycta&quot;, &quot;Megalagrion&quot;, &quot;Prognathogryllus&quot;, &quot;Nesosydne&quot;, &quot;Cephalops&quot;, &quot;Trupanea&quot;, and the tribe Platynini—all suggesting repeated radiations among the islands.

=== Other islands ===
Phylogenetic studies of a species of crab spider (&quot;Misumenops rapaensis&quot;) in the genus Thomisidae located on the Austral Islands have established the, &quot;sequential colonization of [the] lineage down the Austral archipelago toward younger islands&quot;. &quot;M. rapaensis&quot; has been traditionally thought of as a single species; whereas this particular study found distinct genetic differences corresponding to the sequential age of the islands. The figwart plant species &quot;Scrophularia lowei&quot; is thought to have arisen through a peripatric speciation event, with the more widespread mainland species, &quot;Scrophularia arguta&quot; dispersing to the Macaronesian islands. Other members of the same genus have also arisen by single colonization events between the islands.

=== Species patterns on continents ===

The occurrence of peripatry on continents is more difficult to detect due to the possibility of vicariant explanations being equally likely. However, studies concerning the Californian plant species &quot;Clarkia biloba&quot; and &quot;C. lingulata&quot; strongly suggest a peripatric origin. In addition, a great deal of research has been conducted on several species of land snails involving chirality that suggests peripatry (with some authors noting other possible interpretations).

The chestnut-tailed antbird (&quot;Sciaphylax hemimelaena&quot;) is located within the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (Serrania de Huanchaca) in Bolivia. Within this region exists a forest fragment estimated to have been isolated for 1000–3000 years. The population of &quot;S. hemimelaena&quot; antbirds that reside in the isolated patch express significant song divergence; thought to be an &quot;early step&quot; in the process of peripatric speciation. Further, peripheral isolation &quot;may partly explain the dramatic diversification of suboscines in Amazonia&quot;.

The montane spiny throated reed frog species complex (genus: &quot;Hyperolius&quot;) originated through occurrences of peripatric speciation events. Lucinda P. Lawson maintains that the species&#x27; geographic ranges within the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot support a peripatric model that is driving speciation; suggesting that this mode of speciation may play a significant role in &quot;highly fragmented ecosystems&quot;.

In a study of the phylogeny and biogeography of the land snail genus &quot;Monacha&quot;, the species &quot;M. ciscaucasica&quot; is thought to have speciated peripatrically from a population of &quot;M. roseni&quot;. In addition, &quot;M. claussi&quot; consists of a small population located on the peripheral of the much larger range of &quot;M. subcarthusiana&quot; suggesting that it also arose by peripatric speciation.
Red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;) has arisen from an isolated population of black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;). During the Pleistocene, a population of black spruce became geographically isolated, likely due to glaciation. The geographic range of the black spruce is much larger than the red spruce. The red spruce has significantly lower genetic diversity in both its DNA and its mitochondrial DNA than the black spruce. Furthermore, the genetic variation of the red spruce has no unique mitochondrial haplotypes, only subsets of those in the black spruce; suggesting that the red spruce speciated peripatrically from the black spruce population. It is thought that the entire genus &quot;Picea&quot; in North America has diversified by the process of peripatric speciation, as numerous pairs of closely related species in the genus have smaller southern population ranges; and those with overlapping ranges often exhibit weak reproductive isolation.

Using a phylogeographic approach paired with ecological niche models (&quot;i.e.&quot; prediction and identification of expansion and contraction species ranges into suitable habitats based on current ecological niches, correlated with fossil and molecular data), researchers found that the prairie dog species &quot;Cynomys mexicanus&quot; speciated peripatrically from &quot;Cynomys ludovicianus&quot; approximately 230,000 years ago. North American glacial cycles promoted range expansion and contraction of the prairie dogs, leading to the isolation of a relic population in a refugium located in the present day Coahuila, Mexico. This distribution and paleobiogeographic pattern correlates with other species expressing similar biographic range patterns such as with the &quot;Sorex cinereus&quot; complex.

=== Laboratory experiments ===
Peripatric speciation has been researched in both laboratory studies and nature. Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr in &quot;Speciation&quot; suggest that most laboratory studies of allopatric speciation are also examples of peripatric speciation due to their small population sizes and the inevitable divergent selection that they undergo. Much of the laboratory research concerning peripatry is inextricably linked to founder effect research. Coyne and Orr conclude that selection&#x27;s role in speciation is well established, whereas genetic drift&#x27;s role is unsupported by experimental and field data—suggesting that founder-effect speciation does not occur. Nevertheless, a great deal of research has been conducted on the matter, and one study conducted involving bottleneck populations of &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot; found evidence of isolation after a single bottleneck.

The table is a non-exhaustive table of laboratory experiments focused explicitly on peripatric speciation. Most of the studies also conducted experiments on vicariant speciation as well. The &quot;replicates&quot; column signifies the number of lines used in the experiment—that is, how many independent populations were used (not the population size or the number of generations performed).

<text>Estriol (E3), also spelled oestriol, is a steroid, a weak estrogen, and a minor female sex hormone. It is one of three major endogenous estrogens, the others being estradiol and estrone. Levels of estriol in women who are not pregnant are almost undetectable. However, during pregnancy, estriol is synthesized in very high quantities by the placenta and is the most produced estrogen in the body by far, although circulating levels of estriol are similar to those of other estrogens due to a relatively high rate of metabolism and excretion. Relative to estradiol, both estriol and estrone have far weaker activity as estrogens.

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, estriol is used as a medication, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy; for information on estriol as a medication, see the estriol (medication) article.

==Biological activity==
Estriol is an estrogen, specifically an agonist of the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. It is a far less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and as such is a relatively weak estrogen. According to one &quot;in vitro&quot; study, the relative binding affinity (RBA) of estriol for the human ERα and ERβ was 11.3% and 17.6% of that estradiol, respectively, and the relative transactivational capacity of estriol at the ERα and ERβ was 10.6% and 16.6% of that of estradiol, respectively. According to another &quot;in vitro&quot; study however, the RBA of estriol for the ERα and ERβ were 14% and 21% of those of estradiol, respectively, suggesting that unlike estradiol and estrone, estriol may have preferential affinity for ERβ.

Although estriol is an efficacious agonist of the ERs, it is reported to have mixed agonist–antagonist (partial agonist) activity at the ER; on its own, it is weakly estrogenic, but in the presence of estradiol, it is antiestrogenic. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. It is notable that unlike estriol, estrone can be metabolized into estradiol, and most of its potency &quot;in vivo&quot; is in fact actually due to conversion into estradiol.

In addition to acting as an agonist of the nuclear ERs, estriol at high concentrations (~1,000–10,000 nM) also acts as an antagonist of the GPER, a membrane estrogen receptor where, conversely, estradiol acts as an agonist. Estradiol increases breast cancer cell growth via activation of the GPER (in addition to the ER), and estriol has been found to inhibit estradiol-induced proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells through blockade of the GPER.

==Biochemistry==
===Biosynthesis===

====In non-pregnant women====
In women who are not pregnant estriol is produced in only very small quantities, and circulating levels are barely detectable. Unlike estradiol and estrone, estriol is not synthesized in or secreted from the ovaries, and is instead derived mainly if not exclusively from 16α-hydroxylation of estradiol and estrone by cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4) mainly in the liver. Estriol is cleared from the circulation rapidly in non-pregnant women, and so circulating levels are very low, but concentrations of estriol in the urine are relatively high.

Although circulating levels of estriol are very low outside of pregnancy, parous women have been found to have levels of estriol that are to some degree higher than those of nulliparous women.

====In pregnant women====
Estriol is produced in quantities that are notable only during pregnancy. Levels of estriol increase 1,000-fold during pregnancy, whereas levels of estradiol and estrone increase 100-fold, and estriol accounts for 90% of the estrogens in the urine of pregnant women. At term, the daily production of estriol by the placenta is 35 to 45 mg, and levels in the maternal circulation are 8 to 13 ng/dL.

The placenta produces pregnenolone and progesterone from circulating cholesterol. Pregnenolone is taken up by the fetal adrenal glands and converted into dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which is then sulfated by steroid sulfotransferase into dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). DHEA-S is hydroxylated by high CYP3A7 expression and activity into 16α-hydroxy-DHEA-S (16α-OH-DHEA-S) in the fetal liver and to a limited extent in the fetal adrenal glands. 16α-OH-DHEA-S is then taken up by the placenta. Due to high expression of steroid sulfatase in the placenta, 16α-OH-DHEA-S is rapidly cleaved into 16α-OH-DHEA. Then, 16α-OH-DHEA is converted by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (3β-HSD1) into 16α-hydroxyandrostenedione (16α-OH-A4) and 16α-OH-A4 is converted by aromatase into 16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OH-E1), which is subsequently converted into estriol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and then secreted predominantly into the maternal circulation. Approximately 90% of precursors in estriol formation originate from the fetus.

During pregnancy, 90 to 95% of estriol in the maternal circulation is conjugated in the form of estriol glucuronide and estriol sulfate, and levels of unconjugated estriol are slightly less than those of unconjugated estradiol and similar to those of unconjugated estrone. As such, target tissues are likely to be exposed to similar amounts of free estriol, estradiol, and estrone during pregnancy.

Estrone and estradiol are also produced in the placenta during pregnancy. However, in the case of estrone and estradiol, DHEA-S is taken up by the placenta and cleaved by steroid sulfatase into dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA is converted by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I into androstenedione, and androstenedione is aromatized into estrone. Then, placental 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase interconverts estrone and estradiol and the two hormones are secreted into the maternal circulation. DHEA-S that is taken up by the placenta is mainly produced by the fetal adrenal glands.

===Distribution===
Estriol is poorly bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), with much lower binding affinity for this protein, relative to estradiol, and hence a greater fraction available for biological activity.

===Metabolism===
Estriol is metabolized via glucuronidation and sulfation.

===Excretion===
The main urinary metabolites of exogenous estriol administered via intravenous injection in baboons have been found to be estriol 16α-glucuronide (65.8%), estriol 3-glucuronide (14.2%), estriol 3-sulfate (13.4%), and estriol 3-sulfate 16α-glucuronide (5.1%). The metabolism and excretion of estriol in these animals closely resembled that which has been observed in humans. In non-pregnant women, estriol urinary excretion ranges between 0.02–0.1 mg every 24 hours. In comparison, in near-term pregnant women, estriol urinary excretion ranges from 50–150 mg every 24 hours.

==Medical use==
Estriol is used as a medication, primarily in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms.

==Chemistry==

Estriol, also known as 16α-hydroxyestradiol or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,16α,17β-triol, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds between the C1 and C2, C3 and C4, and C5 and C10 positions and hydroxyl groups at the C3, C16α, and C17β positions. The name &quot;estriol&quot; and the abbreviation &quot;E3&quot; were derived from the chemical terms &quot;estrin&quot; (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and triol (three hydroxyl groups).

==History==
Estriol was discovered in 1930. It was isolated and purified from the urine of pregnant women by Marrian and colleagues.

==Use in screening==
Estriol can be measured in maternal blood or urine and can be used as a marker of fetal health and well-being. If levels of unconjugated estriol (uE3 or free estriol) are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate chromosomal or congenital anomalies like Down syndrome or Edward&#x27;s syndrome. It is included as part of the triple test and quadruple test for antenatal screening for fetal anomalies.

Because many pathological conditions in a pregnant woman can cause deviations in estriol levels, these screenings are often seen as less definitive of fetal-placental health than a nonstress test. Conditions which can create false positives and false negatives in estriol testing for fetal distress include preeclampsia, anemia, and impaired kidney function.

<text>Charles Stanley Causley CBE FRSL (24 August 1917 – 4 November 2003) was a Cornish poet, school teacher and writer. His work is often noted for its simplicity and directness as well as its associations with folklore, legends and magic, especially when linked to his native Cornwall.

== Early years==

Causley was born at Launceston, Cornwall, to Charles Samuel Causley, who worked as a groom and gardener, and his wife Laura Jane Bartlett, who was in domestic service. He was educated at the local primary school and Launceston College. When he was seven, in 1924, his father died from long-standing injuries incurred in World War I.

Causley left school at 16, working as a clerk in a builder&#x27;s office. He played in a semi-professional dance band, and wrote plays—one of which was broadcast on the BBC West Country service before World War II.

==Career and achievements==
He enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1940 and served as an ordinary seaman during the Second World War, firstly aboard the destroyer HMS &quot;Eclipse&quot; in the Atlantic, at shore bases in Gibraltar and northwest England. Later he served in the Pacific on the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Glory&quot;, after promotion to petty officer. 

Causley later wrote about his wartime experiences (and their longer-term impact on him) in his poetry, and also in a book of short stories, &quot;Hands to Dance and Skylark&quot;. His first collection of poems, &quot;Farewell, Aggie Weston&quot; (1951) contained the &#x27;Song of the Dying Gunner A.A.1&#x27;:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Farewell, Aggie Weston, the Barracks at Guz,&quot;
&quot;Hang my on the door&quot;
&quot;I&#x27;m sewn up neat in a canvas sheet&quot;
&quot;And I shan&#x27;t be home no more.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
The collection &quot;Survivor&#x27;s Leave&quot; followed in 1953, and from then until his death Causley published frequently, in magazines, in his own volumes and shared ones, in anthologies and then in several editions of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;.

After demobilisation in 1946, he took advantage of a government scheme to train as a teacher at Peterborough. He then worked full-time as a teacher at his old school for over 35 years, teaching for his very final year at St. Catherine&#x27;s CofE Primary elsewhere in the town, where the National School had been relocated. He twice spent time in Perth as a visiting Fellow at the University of Western Australia, and also worked at the Banff School of Fine Arts in Canada.

Causley travelled still more widely and frequently, however, after taking early retirement in 1976 to pursue a full-time career in writing. 

He was much in demand at poetry readings in the United Kingdom and worldwide—the latter travels were sometimes as part of Arts Council and British Council initiatives. He also made many television and radio appearances over the post-war period, particularly for the BBC in the West Country, and as the presenter for many years of the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Poetry Please&quot;.

An intensely private person, he was nevertheless approachable and friendly. He corresponded with and was well-acquainted with such writers as Siegfried Sassoon, A. L. Rowse, Susan Hill, Jack Clemo and Ted Hughes (his closest friend)—and a host of other figures from the literary, publishing and wider cultural spheres around the world, as well the southwest region. 

In addition to Causley&#x27;s poetry dealing with issues of faith, folklore, memory, his wartime experience and its later impact, landscape, travel, friends and family, his poems for children were and remain very popular. He used to say that he could have lived comfortably on the fees paid for the reproduction of &#x27;Timothy Winters&#x27;:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Timothy Winters comes to school&quot;
&quot;With eyes as wide as a football pool,&quot;
&quot;Ears like bombs and teeth like splinters:&quot;
&quot;A blitz of a boy is Timothy Winters.&quot;
—first verse

&quot;So come one angel, come on ten:&quot;
&quot;Timothy Winters says &quot;Amen&quot;
&quot;Amen amen amen amen.&quot;&quot;
&quot;Timothy Winters, Lord.&quot;
&quot;Amen.&quot;
—last verse
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1952 Causley was made a bard of Gorsedh Kernow adopting the bardic name Morvardh (Sea poet). In 1958 Causley was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and he was made a CBE in 1986. When he was 83 years old he was made a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature: he greeted this award with the words, &quot;My goodness, what an encouragement!&quot; 

Other awards include the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1967 and a Cholmondeley Award in 1971. In 1973/74 he was visiting fellow in poetry at the University of Exeter, from which institution he received an honorary doctorate on 7 July 1977. 

He was presented with the Heywood Hill Literary Prize in 2000. Between 1962 and 1966 he was a member of the Poetry Panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain. He was twice awarded a travelling scholarship by the Society of Authors. There was a campaign to have him appointed Poet Laureate on the death of Sir John Betjeman, but in the end, that role was given to Ted Hughes. Causley himself was not very keen on the idea. However, to the people of his home town, he became &quot;the greatest poet laureate we never had&quot;. He was interviewed by Roy Plomley on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 1 December 1979: his music choices included five classical selections and three others, while his chosen book was &quot;Boswell&#x27;s Life of Johnson&quot;.
In 1982, on his 65th birthday, a book of poems was published in his honour that included contributions from Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Philip Larkin and twenty-three other poets, testifying to the respect and indeed love that the British poetry community had for him. This was followed by a fuller and more wide-ranging tribute (including some unpublished reflective essays, and reproductions of several drafts of his poem &#x27;Immunity&#x27; from his archive at Exeter University), published in 1987 and entitled &quot;Causley at 70&quot;.

Causley&#x27;s popularity amongst general readers and listeners, particularly among the Cornish, remains high, and also appears to be expanding. A Causley piece that has gained attention is &quot;Eden Rock&quot;, a reflection on childhood, memory, family and mortality. Its opening lines are:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;They are waiting for me somewhere beyond Eden Rock:&quot;
&quot;My father, twenty-five, in the same suit&quot;
&quot;Of Genuine Irish Tweed, his terrier Jack&quot;
&quot;Still two years old and trembling at his feet.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion has said that if he could write a line as perfect as the one which closes this poem, he would go to his grave a happy man. The full text of &quot;Eden Rock&quot; accompanies a recording on the Poetry Archive website of Causley himself reading it (amongst several other poems) aloud, shortly before his death in 2003.

==Reception==
According to the &quot;Norton Anthology of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, &quot;because his characteristic themes, preoccupations, and freshness of language vary little, it is often difficult to distinguish between his writings for children and those for adults. He himself declared that he did know whether a given poem was for children or adults as he was writing it, and he included his children&#x27;s poetry without comment in his collected works.&quot;

Causley stayed true to what he called his &#x27;guiding principle&#x27;, adopted from Auden and others, that: &quot;while there are some good poems which are only for adults, because they presuppose adult experience in their readers, there are no good poems which are only for children.&quot;

His close friend Ted Hughes said of Causley:

&quot;Among the English poetry of the last half century, Charles Causley&#x27;s could well turn out to be the best loved and most needed... Before I was made Poet Laureate, I was asked to name my choice of the best poet for the job. Without hesitation, I named Charles Causley -- this marvellously resourceful, original poet, yet among all known poets the only one who could be called a man of the people, in the old, best sense. A poet for whom the title might have been invented afresh. I was pleased to hear that in an unpublished letter, Philip Larkin thought the same and chose him too.&quot;
Perhaps because of that widespread perception of Causley as a poetic &#x27;outsider&#x27;, academia has so far paid less attention to his work than it might have done. However, the publication over recent years of a book of critical essays edited by Michael Hanke, &quot;Through the Granite Kingdom&quot;, as well as a number of dissertations about Causley&#x27;s work (alone, or alongside poets such as Larkin and R. S. Thomas) suggest that this situation is changing.

==Legacy==

The Charles Causley Trust, a registered charity, exists to celebrate his life and work and promote new literature activity in the community and region in which he lived. In 2006, the trust secured Cyprus Well, the poet&#x27;s small house in Launceston, for the nation. After considerable repairs, refurbishment and upgrading, that has been opened on a limited basis to the public, and to provide a facility for a varied programme of activities. Most particularly, there has been a series of residencies for writers of all kinds, artists and musicians, as well as other heritage events. These promote both Causley&#x27;s life and work, and the arts in general—especially across the South West region of Cornwall and Devon.

In June 2010, the first of a continuing series of annual Charles Causley Festivals took place in Launceston, held over a long weekend. Festival programmes encompass literature, music, art and a variety of other fields for adults, families and children, featuring performers and other contributors from the local area, the region, the whole of the UK, and even worldwide.

Subsequently, festivals have taken place in and around the town for varying periods of up to a full week or more. Over the years, poets such as Sir Andrew Motion (former Poet Laureate, and patron of the Causley Trust), Dame Carol Ann Duffy, Brian Patten and Lemn Sissay, novelists like Patrick Gale, journalists such as George Alagiah, and illustrators like John Lawrence have been headliners. 

Music at the festival has included regular appearances from Causley&#x27;s distant relative, folk singer Jim Causley. featuring his settings of Causley poems, some of which have been recorded for commercial CDs. 

The fifth festival in June 2014 was prefaced by the unveiling of a memorial plaque at Cyprus Well (another one later marked his nearby birthplace near St Thomas Church and the River Kensey). That festival also marked the centenary of the start of the First World War with a series of talks on war poetry. A documentary film about Causley&#x27;s life and work, made by Jane Darke and Andrew Tebbs of Boatshed Films, featured in several versions across the 6th and 7th festivals (2015 and 2016). A shortened version of the full 1990 film, &quot;The Poet: Charles Causley&quot;, was broadcast on BBC4 as &quot;Charles Causley: Cornwall&#x27;s Native Poet&quot; on 1 October 2017.

The June 2017 festival (the 8th) marked the centenary of Causley&#x27;s birth in August 1917. There were rare performances of several of Causley&#x27;s one-act plays from the 1930s, and a session from the illustrator John Lawrence and Gaby Morgan marking the reissue of &quot;Causley&#x27;s Collected Poems for Children&quot;. The 2018 festival (the 9th) was headlined by poet and broadcaster Roger McGough, while the 10th festival was in June 2019. 

In terms of Causley&#x27;s musical legacy, an original opera by Steven McNeff based on Causley&#x27;s libretto &#x27;The Burning Boy&#x27;, was premiered by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s Kokoro Ensemble in Launceston and St. Ives in November 2017. The majority of the songs of Alex Atterson (1931–1996) are settings of Causley poems. 

An art exhibition entitled &#x27;Charles Causley: A Tribute from the Artists&#x27; was organised to coincide with Causley&#x27;s 70th birthday in 1987 by Ron Tamplin of Exeter University, and featured a wide range of paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures. It later transferred from the University to the Institute of Education in Russell Square, London, for a period; an illustrated catalogue was published.

==International poetry competitions==
The Charles Causley International Poetry Prize is administered by the Causley Trust and is open to anyone over the age of 18. It began in 2013 and has continued in most years since, with a steadily-increasing number of entries. There are a number of monetary prizes and a good deal of publicity for the prize-winning poets and those achieving honourable mentions. 

After its early years, it developed into an international competition. In 2018, the announcements and presentations were hosted by Paul Tyler, Lord Linkinhorne (a patron of the Causley Trust), at the House of Lords.

The following is a list of the competition winners and judges to date:

=== 2020 ===

Melrose began his hockey career as a defenceman in the WCHL with the Kamloops Chiefs in 1974, where he stayed for two years. He started the 1976–77 season with the Springfield Indians of the AHL, before moving mid-season to the Cincinnati Stingers of the WHA, where he stayed until 1979.

Following the demise of the WHA and the subsequent absorption of some of its teams into the NHL, Melrose joined the Winnipeg Jets for the 1979–80 season.

For the remainder of his playing career, Melrose split time between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings, as well as their assorted AHL affiliates. Melrose spent his final season playing with the Adirondack Red Wings of the AHL during the 1986–87 season.

During his NHL playing career, he played 300 games, scoring 10 goals, with 23 assists and 728 penalty minutes. He also played in 7 playoff games with the Toronto Maple Leafs, assisting on 2 goals and receiving 38 penalty minutes.

===Coaching career===
Upon retirement, Melrose immediately began coaching. He coached the 1987–88 season with the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL, leading them to a 44–22–6 record and a Memorial Cup title.

He coached the next season with the Seattle Thunderbirds before jumping to the AHL and coaching the Adirondack Red Wings. He spent three years with the Red Wings, leading them to a Calder Cup win in the 1991–92 season.

Beginning with the 1992–93 season, Melrose coached the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings, leading them to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games. He continued coaching the Kings for two more seasons, finishing both years out of the playoffs and with losing records. He then spent 13 years as a hockey analyst with ESPN. (&quot;NHL Tonight&quot;/&quot;DCI Tonight&quot;) On June 4, 2008, Melrose stated on &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; that he missed coaching and would entertain any NHL coaching offers. He stated, &quot;I miss not having a dog in the fight.&quot;

The Tampa Bay Lightning hired Melrose as their head coach in June 2008. On October 21, 2008, Melrose recorded his first win as a head coach in over 13 years in a 3–2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers. On November 14, 2008, Melrose was fired by the Lightning with a 5–7–4 record.

===ESPN===
Melrose joined ESPN as a guest analyst in the spring of 1994 and 1995 when the Kings missed the playoffs and permanently in the fall of 1995 as a color commentator and studio analyst alongside host John Buccigross and John Saunders. He left ESPN in June 2008 to coach the Tampa Bay Lightning. After his short stint with the Lightning ended, he returned to ESPN on January 1, 2009, in conjunction with the Winter Classic played between the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks. He was also the lead studio analyst on NHL 2Night together with Ray Ferraro along with host Buccigross. The trio also called select NHL games and the Frozen Four championship games together.

On October 10, 2023, John Buccigross, Melrose&#x27;s longtime colleague at ESPN, announced on X that Melrose would be retiring from the network to spend more time with his family after being diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
===NHL Network===
Melrose joined the NHL Network as a contributor in September 2011.

==Personal life==
Born in Kelvington, Saskatchewan to Norrie and James Melrose, he grew up on a farm outside the town. He is the cousin of former NHL players Wendel Clark and Joe Kocur and longtime minor league forward Kerry Clark. Melrose currently resides in Glens Falls, New York with his wife, Cindy, and the couple have two sons, Tyrell and Adrien. Melrose became an American citizen in March 1998.

<doc id="647377" wikidata="Q57718" url="?curid=647377" title="Carlos Gomes Júnior">
<text>Carlos Domingos Gomes Júnior (born December 19, 1949) is a Bissau-Guinean politician who was Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau from 10 May 2004 to 2 November 2005, and again from 25 December 2008 to 10 February 2012. He has been the President of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) since 2002 and is widely known as &quot;Cadogo&quot;. He resigned as prime minister on 10 February 2012 to run in the presidential election triggered by President Malam Bacai Sanhá&#x27;s death on 9 January.

==Background==
Gomes was born in Bolama. He was a delegate to PAIGC&#x27;s Fifth Congress in December 1991, and in the first multiparty elections, held in 1994, he was elected to the National People&#x27;s Assembly of Guinea-Bissau from the 26th Electoral District. In 1996, he was elected First Vice-President of the National People&#x27;s Assembly, Second Secretary of the Interparliamentary Committee of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, and Vice-President of the Interparliamentary Committee of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. In the National People&#x27;s Assembly, he also served as Chairman of the Committee for Economic Affairs and President of the Administrative Council. At PAIGC&#x27;s Sixth Congress in May 1998, Gomes was elected to the party&#x27;s Political Bureau, and at the party&#x27;s Third Extraordinary Congress in September 1999 he was re-elected to the Political Bureau and also became the party&#x27;s Secretary for Foreign Relations and International Cooperation.

Gomes was elected as President of PAIGC at the Fourth Extraordinary Congress in January–February 2002. He is a banker and businessman, reputed to be the richest man in Guinea-Bissau. PAIGC won the most seats in the March 2004 parliamentary election, and Gomes became prime minister in May.

==Political life==
Prior to the victory of former president Vieira in the mid-2005 presidential election, Gomes said that he would resign if Vieira was elected, referring to the latter as a &quot;bandit and mercenary who betrayed his own people&quot;. After Vieira&#x27;s election, Gomes initially refused to recognize the result, but he also moved away from his earlier threat to resign. Vieira took office on 1 October 2005, and almost two weeks later he and Gomes had a meeting, with Gomes anticipating that the two would be able to work together. However, on 28 October Vieira announced the dissolution of Gomes&#x27;s government, and a long-time ally of Vieira, Aristides Gomes, was appointed prime minister on 2 November 2005.

Following the assassination of former navy commander Mohamed Lamine Sanha in early January 2007, Gomes accused Vieira of involvement in the killing in an interview with Lusa on January 8. A warrant was issued for Gomes&#x27;s arrest on January 10, and when police tried to arrest him later that day he fled and took refuge in the United Nations building in Bissau. A spokesman for Gomes said that it would be unconstitutional to arrest him because he enjoyed immunity as a member of the National People&#x27;s Assembly. A presidential spokesman accused Gomes of trying to destabilize the country. Gomes left the UN building on January 29, after the arrest warrant was dropped.

According to Gomes, he was misquoted in the interview that led to the arrest warrant. An investigating judge said that Gomes had not provided any proof for his claim of Vieira&#x27;s involvement, and on December 20, 2007, it was announced that Gomes had been charged with false testimony and slandering the head of state.

Gomes sought re-election as President of PAIGC at the party&#x27;s Seventh Ordinary Congress in June–July 2008. Malam Bacai Sanhá, the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in 2000 and 2005, challenged Gomes for the party leadership, but Gomes was re-elected at the end of the congress on July 1–2, receiving 578 votes against 355 for Sanhá.

===2008 election===
In the November 2008 legislative election, PAIGC won a majority of 67 out of 100 seats in the National People&#x27;s Assembly. Gomes himself was elected to a seat as a PAIGC candidate in the 24th constituency, located in Bissau. Following the election, Vieira appointed Gomes as prime minister on December 25, 2008. Gomes said on this occasion that his government would focus on &quot;good governance and a reform of the justice system&quot; and that he and Vieira would &quot;put aside any personal differences&quot; in order to work towards solving the country&#x27;s problems. He was sworn in on January 2, 2009.

===2010 military unrest===

Following the failure of a coup plot in 2008, Rear Admiral Bubo Na Tchuto escaped to Gambia where he was arrested. Subsequently, he clandestinely returned to Guinea-Bissau where he took refuge at a UN compound. The UN agreed to turn him over to the government. Nevertheless, he continued to stay in the compound. On April 1, 2010, soldiers went to the UN office. Bubo Na Tchuto voluntarily left with them. On The same day, soldiers invaded Prime Minister Gomes’ residence and held him there. 

Simultaneously, forty military officers, including the head of Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s armed forces, were held at an army base. 

Hundreds of the PM&#x27;s supporters demanded his release. In response the deputy army chief, Antonio Ndjai, said: &quot;If the people continue to go out into the streets to show their support for Carlos Gomes Junior, then I will kill Carlos Gomes Junior ... or I will send someone to kill him.&quot;

===2012 election and coup===

He resigned as prime minister on 10 February 2012 in order to run in the presidential election. He won the first round and was due to face a runoff against Mohamed Ialá Embaló. Prior to the a second round, a coup against the civilian government resulted in a military takeover of the capital, Bissau, amid reports that he was killed. However, Gomes and President Raimundo Pereira were arrested by the military as gunfire ensued in the capital of Bissau. The Chairperson of the African Union Jean Ping issued a statement rejecting the coup and demanded the release of Pereira and Gomes. The United Nations Security Council issued a statement saying that they &quot;strongly condemn the forcible seizure of power&quot;.

On 27 April, the deposed leaders were freed and sent to the Ivory Coast.

<doc id="647388" wikidata="Q2707384" url="?curid=647388" title="Side project">
<text>In popular music, a side project is a project undertaken by one or more people already known for their involvement in another band. It can also be an artist or a band temporarily switching to a different style.

Usually these projects emphasize a different aspect of that person&#x27;s or that band&#x27;s musical interests that they feel they cannot explore within the boundaries established by their main project. Side projects can later become full-time endeavours, but should not be confused with quitting a band for a solo career or another band. Peter Hartlaub of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the solo side project &quot;the biggest longshot bet in mainstream music&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described the side project as &quot;a break from the other band members, a chance to toy with different genres and recording methods, a fling with no long-term commitment&quot;. There can be aesthetic reasons to pursue side projects, and side projects can have the benefit of protecting indie credibility.

==Overview==
One of the earliest examples of a side project in the rock era was that of The Four Seasons, who established The Wonder Who? as a brand for experimental and novelty covers that could not be released under their own name; more enduringly, lead singer Frankie Valli&#x27;s solo career began as a side project. Such was the rarity of such arrangements at the time that Philips Records, the Four Seasons&#x27; record label at the time of Valli&#x27;s early solo work, was initially afraid that it was a sign the band was soon to dissolve or that Valli was leaving, which Valli assured he had no intention of doing.

One example of musical side projects is Kiss&#x27;s decision in 1978 to have each member of the band, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, simultaneously release solo albums. In 1992, The Melvins released solo EPs in a similar fashion.

&quot;Side project&quot; may also refer to pursuits of famous individuals outside of their primary fields. For instance, Wicked Wisdom is a &quot;side project&quot; of actress Jada Pinkett Smith. Side projects often occur at a crossroads of a celebrity&#x27;s career.

A side project can also be a band that takes on an &quot;alter ego&quot;, usually in order to play a different style of music that their fans are not used to. An example of this type of side project would be the band Weezer, who is also the Nirvana cover band Goat Punishment.

Another example of a side project is when in 1990, Jesper Strömblad of Ceremonial Oath decided to start a side project known as In Flames because he wanted to start a new project that combined Iron Maiden and death metal all together which he said he had never heard of before, the side project then grew into a band in 1995 and is now one of the most influential metal bands of all time, and still together without Jesper.

A joint side project consisting of members of multiple known bands is known as a supergroup.

=== Pennant winners ===

From 1939 through 1942 and 1944 through 1947, the team in first place at the end of the season was declared the Pennant winner. Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. For example, the 1937 season featured Kansas City being first place with a 52–19–1 record (.732). However, they still competed in a Championship Series, albeit against the third place team in the Chicago American Giants (36–24–1), who played fewer games than the 2nd place Cincinnati Tigers (35–18–1) but had one more win.

This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The &quot;games behind&quot; method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues. From 1942 until 1948, the pennant winner (as determined by record or by postseason series victory) went on to the Negro World Series.

==== Post-integration champions ====

*1954 Indianapolis Clowns

*1956 Detroit Stars

=== League play-offs ===
On numerous occasions, the NAL split the season into two halves. The winner of the first half played the winner of the second half for the league Pennant. As mentioned above, disputes also occurred in the split season finishes. Five times a League Championship Series was played, with varying games needed to win the Series; the 1938 series ended prematurely because of problems with finding a suitable venue for the rest of the series.

;Legend
* One game finished in a tied game.

=== Negro World Series ===
For the duration of the league, a Negro World Series took place seven times, from 1942 through 1948. The NAL Pennant winner met the champion of the rival Negro National League. Five out of the seven years, the Negro American League team (below in bold) succumbed.

<doc id="647405" wikidata="Q5330071" url="?curid=647405" title="Eastern Colored League">
<text>The Mutual Association of Eastern Colored Clubs, more commonly known as the Eastern Colored League (ECL), was one of the several Negro leagues, which operated during the time organized baseball was segregated.

== League history ==

===Founding ===

The ECL was founded in 1923 when the Philadelphia-area Hilldale Club and the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, both associate members of the midwest-based Negro National League (NNL), broke with the NNL and allied with the white promoter Nat Strong to form an east coast league. The charter members were: Hilldale, the Bacharach Giants, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, the Cuban Stars (East), the Lincoln Giants of New York, and the Baltimore Black Sox. In 1924 the Harrisburg Giants and Washington Potomacs joined, bringing the circuit to eight clubs. The ECL raided the NNL for players, including Hall of Famers Oscar Charleston, Biz Mackey, and John Henry Lloyd, starting a war that lasted for two years.

In 1925 the Washington Potomacs moved to Wilmington, Delaware, but still disbanded in July. Their 1926 replacement, the Newark Stars, folded after only 11 games.

=== Uneasy peace ===

At the end of the 1924 season the two leagues made peace and arranged for a Colored World Series between their champions. This series was played each year from 1924 through 1927. The only ECL club to win the World Series was Hilldale in 1925.

=== Demise ===

Beginning in 1927 the league was wracked by dissension between club owners. New York&#x27;s Lincoln Giants dropped out for that season. They returned the next, but then Hilldale, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, and the Harrisburg Giants all dropped out. The Philadelphia Tigers were recruited to bring the league up to five teams for 1928. The ECL staggered through May, but finally disbanded in the midst of disputes over player contracts at the beginning of June.

== ECL franchises ==

:&quot;Annual final standings: 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928&quot;
* Atlantic City Bacharach Giants (1923–1928)
* Baltimore Black Sox (1923–1928)
* Brooklyn Royal Giants (1923–1928)
* Cuban Stars (East) (1923–1928)
* Hilldale of Darby, Pennsylvania (1923–1927)
* New York Lincoln Giants (1923–1928)
* Harrisburg Giants (1924–1927)
* Washington/Wilmington Potomacs (1924–1925)
* Newark Stars (1926)
* Philadelphia Tigers (1928)

=== Member timeline ===

*1923: Formation of ECL consisting of 6 teams — Hilldale, Cuban Stars, Brooklyn Royal Giants, Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, New York Lincoln Giants and Baltimore Black Sox
*1924: Added Harrisburg Giants and Washington/Wilmington Potomacs.
*1926: Dropped Washington/Wilmington Potomacs; Added Newark Stars.
*1927: Dropped Newark Stars.
*1928: Dropped Harrisburg Giants; Added Homestead Grays. The league broke up midway through the season due to the breakdown of the founder (and manager of Hilldale) although the individual teams continued to play.

== League champions ==

=== Pennant Winners ===

The team in first place at the end of the season was declared the Pennant winner. Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The &quot;games behind&quot; method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues. Four of the five pennant winners went on to play in the Negro World Series (all except for the first in 1923).

=== Colored World Series ===
For the duration of the league, a Colored World Series took place four times, from 1924 through 1927. The ECL Pennant winner met the champion of the rival Negro National League. Three out of the four years, the Eastern Colored League team (below in bold) succumbed.

*1924 – Kansas City Monarchs beat Hilldale Club, 5 games to 4 games (1 tie)
*1925 – Hilldale Club beat Kansas City Monarchs, 5 games to 1 game
*1926 – Chicago American Giants beat Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, 5 games to 4 games (2 ties)

<text>The first Negro National League (NNL I) was one of the several Negro leagues that were established during the period in the United States when organized baseball was segregated. The league was formed in 1920 with former player Rube Foster as its president.

== League history ==
=== Founding ===

Led by Rube Foster, owner and manager of the Chicago American Giants, the NNL was established on February 13, 1920, by a coalition of team owners at a meeting in a Kansas City YMCA. The formation included the creation of the NLL constitution, written by journalist Cary B. Lewis, David Wyatt from the &quot;Indianapolis Ledger&quot;, Elwood C. Knox from the &quot;Indianapolis Freeman&quot;, and attorney Elisha Scott.

The new league was the first African-American baseball circuit to achieve stability and last more than one season. At first the league operated mainly in midwestern cities, ranging from Kansas City in the west to Pittsburgh in the east; in 1924 it expanded into the south, adding franchises in Birmingham, Alabama, and Memphis, Tennessee.

=== Competition ===
The two most important east coast clubs, the Hilldale Club of Darby, Pennsylvania, and the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, were affiliated with the NNL as associate clubs from 1920 to 1922, but did not compete for the championship. In 1923 they and four other eastern teams formed the Eastern Colored League (ECL) and raided the NNL for many of its top players, including John Henry Lloyd, Biz Mackey, George Scales, George Carr, and Clint Thomas, and signing Oscar Charleston, and Rube Curry in 1924. The war between the two leagues came to an end in 1924, when they agreed to respect each other&#x27;s contracts and arranged for the Colored World Series between their champions.

=== Difficulties and demise ===
The NNL survived controversies over umpiring, scheduling, and what some perceived as league president Rube Foster&#x27;s disproportionate influence and favoritism toward his own team. It also outlasted Foster&#x27;s decline into mental illness in 1926, and its eastern rival, the ECL, which folded in early 1928. The NNL finally fell apart in 1931 under the economic stress of the Great Depression.

=== Legacy ===
The Negro American League, founded in 1937 and including several of the same teams that played in the original Negro National League, would eventually carry on as the western circuit of black baseball. A second Negro National League was organized in 1933, but eventually became concentrated on the east coast.

To distinguish between the two unrelated leagues, they are usually referred to as the first Negro National League (NNL I) and the second Negro National League (NNL II).

== League champions ==

=== Pennant winners ===

From 1920 through 1924, the team in first place at the end of the season was declared the Pennant winner. Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. The 1931 season did not finish all games, which meant that while St. Louis was awarded the title, non-member Pittsburgh Crawfords disputed their status as champion. From 1924 to 1927, the pennant champion went to play in the Negro World Series. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The &quot;games behind&quot; method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues.

† – Pennant was decided via a split-season schedule with the winner of the first half of the season playing the winner of the second half of the season, unless one team won both halves.

=== League play-offs ===
From 1925 through 1931, the NNL split the season into two halves. The winner of the first half played the winner of the second half for the league Pennant. As mentioned above, disputes also occurred in the split season finishes. 1929 and 1931 saw Kansas City win both halves.

=== Colored World Series ===

For the duration of the league, a Colored World Series took place four times, from 1924 through 1927. The NNL Pennant winner met the champion of the rival Eastern Colored League. Three out of the four years, the Negro National League team (below in bold) won.
